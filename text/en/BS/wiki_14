<text>Income inequality metrics or income distribution metrics are used by social scientists to measure the distribution of income and economic inequality among the participants in a particular economy, such as that of a specific country or of the world in general. While different theories may try to explain how income inequality comes about, income inequality metrics simply provide a system of measurement used to determine the dispersion of incomes. The concept of inequality is distinct from poverty and fairness.

Income distribution has always been a central concern of economic theory and economic policy. Classical economists such as Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus and David Ricardo were mainly concerned with factor income distribution, that is, the distribution of income between the main factors of production, land, labour and capital. It is often related to wealth distribution, although separate factors influence wealth inequality.

Modern economists have also addressed this issue, but have been more concerned with the distribution of income across individuals and households. Important theoretical and policy concerns include the relationship between income inequality and economic growth. The article economic inequality discusses the social and policy aspects of income distribution questions.

==Defining income==
All of the metrics described below are applicable to evaluating the distributional inequality of various kinds of resources. Here the focus is on income as a resource. As there are various forms of &quot;income&quot;, the investigated kind of income has to be clearly described.

One form of income is the total amount of goods and services that a person receives, and thus there is not necessarily money or cash involved. If a subsistence farmer in Uganda grows his own grain, it will count as income. Services like public health and education are also counted in. Often expenditure or consumption (which is the same in an economic sense) is used to measure income. The World Bank uses the so-called &quot;living standard measurement surveys&quot; to measure income. These consist of questionnaires with more than 200 questions. Surveys have been completed in most developing countries.

Applied to the analysis of income inequality within countries, &quot;income&quot; often stands for the taxed income per individual or per household. Here, income inequality measures also can be used to compare the income distributions before and after taxation in order to measure the effects of progressive tax rates.

==Properties of inequality metrics==

In the discrete case, an economic inequality index may be represented by a function &quot;I(x)&quot;, where &quot;x&quot; is a set of &quot;n&quot; economic values (e.g. wealth or income) &quot;x={x1,x2...,xn}&quot; with &quot;xi&quot; being the economic value associated with &quot;economic agent&quot; &quot;i&quot;.

In the economic literature on inequality four properties are generally postulated that any measure of inequality should satisfy:

* Anonymity or symmetry
*:This assumption states that an inequality metric does not depend on the &quot;labeling&quot; of individuals in an economy and all that matters is the distribution of income. For example, in an economy composed of two people, Mr. Smith and Mrs. Jones, where one of them has 60% of the income and the other 40%, the inequality metric should be the same whether it is Mr. Smith or Mrs. Jones who has the 40% share. This property distinguishes the concept of inequality from that of fairness where who owns a particular level of income and how it has been acquired is of central importance. An inequality metric is a statement simply about how income is distributed, not about who the particular people in the economy are or what kind of income they &quot;deserve&quot;.
*:This is generally expressed mathematically as:
*:formula_1
*:where &quot;P(x)&quot; is any permutation of &quot;x&quot;;
* Scale independence or homogeneity
*:This property says that richer economies should not be automatically considered more unequal by construction. In other words, if every person&#x27;s income in an economy is doubled (or multiplied by any positive constant) then the overall metric of inequality should not change. Of course the same thing applies to poorer economies. The inequality income metric should be independent of the aggregate level of income. This may be stated as:
*:formula_2
*:where α is a positive real number.
* Population independence
*:Similarly, the income inequality metric should not depend on whether an economy has a large or small population. An economy with only a few people should not be automatically judged by the metric as being more equal than a large economy with many people. This means that the metric should be independent of the level of population. This is generally written:
*:formula_3
*:where formula_4 is the union of &quot;x&quot; with a copy of itself.
* Transfer principle
*:The Pigou–Dalton, or transfer principle, is the assumption that makes an inequality metric actually a measure of inequality. In its weak form it says that if some income is transferred from a rich person to a poor person, while still preserving the order of income ranks, then the measured inequality should not increase. In its strong form, the measured level of inequality should decrease.

Other useful but not mandatory properties include:

* Non-negativity
*:The index &quot;I(x)&quot; is greater than or equal to zero.
* Egalitarian zero
*:The index &quot;I(x)&quot; is zero in the egalitarian case, when all values &quot;xi&quot; are equal.
* Bounded above by maximum inequality
*:The index &quot;I(x)&quot; attains its maximum value for maximum inequality. (all xi are zero except one) This value is usually unity as the number of agents &quot;n&quot; approaches infinity.
* Subgroup decomposability
*:This property states that if a set of agents &quot;x&quot; is divided into two disjoint subsets (&quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot;) then the &quot;I(x)&quot; is expressible as:
*:formula_5
*:where &quot;μ(x)&quot; and &quot;μ(y)&quot; are the mean incomes of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;.
*:formula_6
*:and the &quot;w&quot; functions are scalar weighting function of the sets &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot;. In a stronger statement, &quot;wy = μy / μx&quot; and &quot;wz = μz / μx&quot;.

==Common income inequality metrics==

Among the most common metrics used to measure inequality are the Gini index (also known as Gini coefficient), the Theil index, and the Hoover index. They have all four properties described above.

An additional property of an inequality metric that may be desirable from an empirical point of view is that of &#x27;decomposability&#x27;. This means that if a particular economy is broken down into sub-regions, and an inequality metric is computed for each sub region separately, then the measure of inequality for the economy as a whole should be a weighted average of the regional inequalities plus a term proportional to the inequality in the averages of the regions. (in a weaker form, it means that it should be an explicit function of sub-regional inequalities, though not necessarily linear). Of the above indexes, only the Theil index has this property.

Because these income inequality metrics are summary statistics that seek to aggregate an entire distribution of incomes into a single index, the information on the measured inequality is reduced. This information reduction of course is the goal of computing inequality measures, as it reduces complexity.

A weaker reduction of complexity is achieved if income distributions are described by shares of total income. Rather than to indicate a single measure, the society under investigation is split into segments, such as into quintiles (or any other percentage of population). Usually each segment contains the same share of income earners. In case of an unequal income distribution, the shares of income available in each segment are different.

In many cases the inequality indices mentioned above are computed from such segment data without evaluating the inequalities within the segments. The higher the number of segments (such as deciles instead of quintiles), the closer the measured inequality of distribution gets to the real inequality. (If the inequality within the segments is known, the total inequality can be determined by those inequality metrics which have the property of being &quot;decomposable&quot;.)

Quintile measures of inequality satisfy the transfer principle only in its weak form because any changes in income distribution outside the relevant quintiles are not picked up by this measures; only the distribution of income between the very rich and the very poor matters while inequality in the middle plays no role.

Details of the three inequality measures are described in the respective Wikipedia articles. The following subsections cover them only briefly.

===Gini index===
The Gini index is a summary statistic that measures how equitably a resource is distributed in a population; income is a primary example. In addition to a self-contained presentation of the Gini index, we give two equivalent ways to interpret this summary statistic: first in terms of the percentile level of the person who earns the &quot;average dollar&quot;, and second in terms of how the lower of two randomly chosen incomes compare, on average, to mean income.

The Gini is the sum, over all income-ordered population percentiles, of the shortfall, from equal share, of the cumulative income up to each population percentile, with that summed shortfall divided by the greatest value that it could have, with complete inequality.

The range of the Gini index is between 0 and 1 (0% and 100%), where 0 indicates perfect equality and 1 (100%) indicates maximum inequality.

The Gini index is the most frequently used inequality index. The reason for its popularity is that it is easy to understand how to compute the Gini index as a ratio of two areas in Lorenz curve diagrams. This measure tries to capture the overall dispersion of income; however, it tends to place different levels of importance on the bottom, middle and top end of the distribution. As a disadvantage, the Gini index only maps a number to the properties of a diagram, but the diagram itself is not based on any model of a distribution process. The &quot;meaning&quot; of the Gini index only can be understood empirically. Additionally, the Gini does not capture where in the distribution the inequality occurs. As a result, two very different distributions of income can have the same Gini index.

===20:20 ratio===

The 20:20 or 20/20 ratio compares how much richer the top 20% of populations are to the bottom 20% of a given population. This can be more revealing of the actual impact of inequality in a population, as it reduces the effect on the statistics of outliers at the top and bottom and prevents the middle 60% from statistically obscuring inequality that is otherwise obvious in the field. The measure is used for the United Nations Development Programme Human Development Indicators. The 20:20 ratio for example shows that Japan and Sweden have a low equality gap, where the richest 20% only earn 4 times the poorest 20%, whereas in the UK the ratio is 7 times and in the US 8 times. Some believe the 20:20 ratio is a more useful measure as it correlates well with measures of human development and social stability including the index of child well-being, index of health and social problems, population in prison, physical health, mental health and many others.

===Palma ratio===

The Palma ratio is defined as the ratio of the richest 10% of the population&#x27;s share of gross national income divided by the poorest 40%&#x27;s share. It is based on the work of Chilean economist Gabriel Palma who found that middle class incomes almost always represent about half of gross national income while the other half is split between the richest 10% and poorest 40%, but the share of those two groups varies considerably across countries.

The Palma ratio addresses the Gini index&#x27;s over-sensitivity to changes in the middle of the distribution and insensitivity to changes at the top and bottom, and therefore more accurately reflects income inequality&#x27;s economic impacts on society as a whole. Palma has suggested that distributional politics pertains mainly to the struggle between the rich and poor, and who the middle classes side with.

The carbon Palma ratio, which is derived from the income Palma ratio and described as the ratio of the total emissions of the top 10% of emitters to those of the bottom 40%, is proposed as a new indicator to inform the international community and the general public about the distribution inequality of carbon emissions among individuals. The ratio is calculated both within and between countries using an elastic relationship between individual emissions and income. The results show that the carbon Palma ratios in most developing countries are generally high, implying that they should concentrate more on coordinating regional and income inequalities and primarily encouraging high emitters to reduce in order to enhance emissions and income equity at the same time. The carbon Palma ratios in developed countries are comparatively lower; however, their greater historical obligations to warming indicate that they significantly reduce emissions of all people, in order to increase national mitigation contributions systematically. On a global scale, the current carbon Palma ratio is noticeably higher than within any country, indicating an exceedingly severe inequality when individual emissions are considered outside territorial boundaries.

===Hoover index===

The Hoover index is the simplest of all inequality measures to calculate: It is the proportion of all income which would have to be redistributed to achieve a state of perfect equality.

In a perfectly equal world, no resources would need to be redistributed to achieve equal distribution: a Hoover index of 0. In a world in which all income was received by just one family, almost 100% of that income would need to be redistributed (i.e., taken and given to other families) in order to achieve equality. The Hoover index then ranges between 0 and 1 (0% and 100%), where 0 indicates perfect equality and 1 (100%) indicates maximum inequality.

===Galt score===
The Galt score is a simple ratio of a company&#x27;s CEO pay to the pay of that company&#x27;s median worker. A company which pays its CEO many times more than its median employee will have a high Galt score.

It is named for the fictional character John Galt in Ayn Rand&#x27;s novel &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; (1957).

The score is calculated using the total compensation of the CEO, including salary, bonuses, the value of stock awards and employee stock options, as well as non-equity incentive plan compensation, and nonqualified deferred compensation.

===Coefficient of variation===
Coefficient of variation (CV) used as a measure of income inequality is conducted by dividing the standard deviation of the income (square root of the variance of the incomes) by the mean of income. Coefficient of variation will be therefore lower in countries with smaller standard deviations implying more equal income distribution.

It has the advantages of being mathematically tractable and its square is subgroup decomposable, but it is not bounded from above. This simple form of measurement is not being commonly used mostly for its two considerable limitations. The first one could be attributed to CV not having and upper limit, unlike the Gini coefficient, therefore causing difficulties with interpretation and comparison. Secondly, as the mean and standard deviation may be heavily affected by anomalous borderline values, the coefficient would not be an appropriate choice of income inequality measure for a case of abnormal data distribution.

Compared to the Gini coefficient in practice, CV puts higher weight on the right tail of the scale, making it sensitive to the rich. Coefficient of variation may be a suitable choice of measure if the goal of a study is to analyze the wealth concentration at the top of the distribution.

=== Variance of the Natural Logarithm of Income ===
The variance of log Income is described as variance applied to the distribution of log incomes. This scale invariant measure of relative inequality is sensitive to the left tail, making it ideal to use when studying the levels of poverty of the lower income half (the poor).

===Wage share===

Wage share is the ratio between Compensation of employees and GDP. In other words, it is the total of employees&#x27; income divided by the national income.

=== Sen poverty measure ===
Sen poverty measure combines the Gini coefficient for people living below the poverty line with headcount ration of poverty and the average income of these below the poverty line. This measure has been developed by Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen but has not yet been used in the field of income inequality hypothesis. Although it has been greeted with enthusiasm, the Sen poverty index does not fulfill number of ideal conditions, e.g. it fails to satisfy the transfer axiom, it is not decomposable or subgroup consistent.

===Theil index===
As described in a section below, Theil-L is an income-distribution&#x27;s dis-entropy per person, measured with respect to maximum entropy (which is achieved with complete equality). (In an alternative interpretation of it, Theil-L is the natural-logarithm of the geometric-mean of the ratio: (mean income)/(income i), over all the incomes. The related Atkinson(1) is just 1 minus the geometric-mean of (income i)/(mean income), over the income distribution.)
Because a transfer between a larger income &amp; a smaller one will change the smaller income&#x27;s ratio more than it changes the larger income&#x27;s ratio, the transfer-principle is satisfied by this index.

A Theil index of 0 indicates perfect equality. A Theil index of 1 indicates that the distributional entropy of the system under investigation is almost similar to a system with an 82:18 distribution. This is slightly more unequal than the inequality in a system to which the &quot;80:20 Pareto principle&quot; applies. The Theil index can be transformed into an Atkinson index, which has a range between 0 and 1 (0% and 100%), where 0 indicates perfect equality and 1 (100%) indicates maximum inequality. (See Generalized entropy index for the transformation.)

The Theil index is an entropy measure. As for any resource distribution and with reference to information theory, &quot;maximum entropy&quot; occurs once income earners cannot be distinguished by their resources, i.e. when there is perfect equality. In real societies people can be distinguished by their different resources, with the resources being incomes. The more &quot;distinguishable&quot; they are, the lower is the &quot;actual entropy&quot; of a system consisting of income and income earners. Also based on information theory, the gap between these two entropies can be called &quot;redundancy&quot;. It behaves like a negative entropy.

For the Theil index also the term &quot;Theil entropy&quot; had been used. This caused confusion. As an example, Amartya Sen commented on the Theil index, &quot;given the association of doom with entropy in the context of thermodynamics, it may take a little time to get used to entropy as a good thing.&quot; It is important to understand that an increasing Theil index &quot;does not&quot; indicate an increasing entropy, instead it indicates an increasing redundancy (decreasing entropy).

High inequality yields high Theil redundancies. High redundancy means low entropy. But this does not necessarily imply that a very high inequality is &quot;good&quot;, because very low entropies also can lead to explosive compensation processes. Neither does using the Theil index necessarily imply that a very low inequality (low redundancy, high entropy) is &quot;good&quot;, because high entropy is associated with slow, weak and inefficient resource allocation processes.

There are three variants of the Theil index. When applied to income distributions, the first Theil index (Theil-L) relates to how income is distributed to income earners, whereas the second Theil index (Theil-T) relates to how income-earners are distributed to incomes.

A third &quot;symmetrized&quot; Theil index (Theil-S) is the arithmetic average of the two previous indices. The formula of the third Theil index has some similarity with the Hoover index (as explained in the related articles). As in case of the Hoover index, the symmetrized Theil index does not change when swapping the incomes with the income earners. How to generate that third Theil index by means of a spreadsheet computation directly from distribution data is shown below.

An important property of the Theil index which makes its application popular is its decomposability into the between-group and within-group component. For example, the Theil index of overall income inequality can be decomposed in the between-region and within region components of inequality, while the relative share attributable to the between-region component suggests the relative importance of spatial dimension of income inequality.

====Comparison of the Theil index and the Hoover index====
 The Theil index indicates the distributional redundancy of a system, within which incomes are assigned to income earners in a stochastic process. In comparison, the Hoover index indicates the minimum size of the income share of a society, which would have to be redistributed in order to reach maximum entropy. Not to exceed that minimum size would require a perfectly planned redistribution. Therefore, the Hoover index is the &quot;non-stochastic&quot; counterpart to the &quot;stochastic&quot; Theil index.

Applying the Theil index to allocation processes in the real world does &quot;not&quot; imply that these processes are stochastic: the Theil yields the &quot;distance&quot; between an ordered resource distribution in an observed system to the final stage of stochastic resource distribution in a closed system. Similarly, applying the Hoover index does &quot;not&quot; imply that allocation processes occur in a perfectly planned economy: the Hoover index yields the &quot;distance&quot; between the resource distribution in an observed system to the final stage of a planned &quot;equalization&quot; of resource distribution. For both indices, such an equalization only serves as a reference, not as a goal.

For a given distribution the Theil index can be larger than the Hoover index or smaller than the Hoover index:
*For &quot;high&quot; inequalities the Theil index is larger than the Hoover index. This means for achieving equilibrium (maximum entropy) in a closed system, more resources would have to be reallocated than in case of a planned and optimized reallocation process, where only the necessary minimum share of resources would have to be reallocated. For an open system the export of entropy (import of redundancy) would allow to maintain the distribution dynamics driven by high inequality.
*For &quot;low&quot; inequalities the Theil index is smaller than the Hoover index. Here, on the path to reaching equilibrium, a planned and optimized reallocation of resources would contribute more to the dynamics of redistribution than stochastic redistribution. This also is intuitively understandable, as low inequalities also weaken the urge to redistribute resources. People in such a system may tolerate or even foster an increase the inequality. As this is would be an increase of redundancy (an decrease of entropy), redundancy would have to be imported into (entropy would have to be exported from) the society. In that case the society needs to be an open system. In order to increase the redundancy in the distribution category of a society as a closed system, entropy needs to be exported from the subsystem operating in that economic category to other subsystems with other entropy categories in the society. For example, social entropy may increase. However, in the real world, societies are open systems, but the openness is restricted by the entropy exchange capabilities of the interfaces between the society and the environment of that society. For societies with a resource distribution which entropywise is similar to the resource distribution of a reference society with a 73:27 split (73% of the resources belong to 27% of the population and vice versa), the point where the Hoover index and the Theil index are equal, is at a value of around 46% (0.46) for the Hoover index and the Theil index.

=== Atkinson index ===
Atkinson index (also known as the Atkinson measure or Atkinson inequality measure) is a measure useful in determining which end of the distribution contributed most to the observed inequality.

The Atkinson ε parameter is often called the &quot;inequality aversion parameter&quot;, since it regulates the sensitivity of the implied social welfare losses from inequality to income inequality as measured by some corresponding generalised entropy index. The Atkinson index is defined in reference to a corresponding social welfare function, where mean income multiplied by one minus the Atkinson index gives the welfare equivalent equally distributed income.

The index can be turned into a normative measure by imposing a coefficient ε to weight incomes. Greater weight can be placed on changes in a given portion of the income distribution by choosing ε, the level of &quot;inequality aversion&quot;, appropriately. The Atkinson index becomes more sensitive to changes at the lower end of the income distribution as ε increases. Conversely, as the level of inequality aversion falls (that is, as ε approaches 0) the Atkinson becomes less sensitive to changes in the lower end of the distribution. The Atkinson index is for no value of ε highly sensitive to top incomes because of the common restriction that ε is nonnegative.

== Ratios ==
Another common class of metrics is to take the ratio of the income of two different groups, generally &quot;higher over lower&quot;. This compares two &quot;parts&quot; of the income distribution, rather than the distribution as a whole; equality between these parts corresponds to 1:1, while the more unequal the parts, the greater the ratio. These statistics are easy to interpret and communicate, because they are relative (this population earns twice as much as this population), but, since they do not fall on an absolute scale, do not provide an absolute measure of inequality.

=== Ratio of percentiles ===

Particularly common to compare a given percentile to the median, as in the first chart here; compare seven-number summary, which summarizes a distribution by certain percentiles. While such ratios do not represent the &quot;overall level&quot; of inequality in the population as a whole, they provide measures of the &quot;shape&quot; of income distribution. For example, the attached graph shows that in the period 1967–2003, US income ratio between median and 10th and 20th percentile did not change significantly, while the ratio between the median and 80th, 90th, and 95th percentile increased. This reflects that the increase in the Gini coefficient of the US in this time period is due to gains by upper income earners (relative to the median), rather than by losses by lower income earners (relative to the median).

=== Share of income ===
A related class of ratios is &quot;income share&quot;, the percentage of the national income received by some specified richest or poorest percentage-segment of the population.

The population, but the Lorenz Curve (discussed in the Gini section) graphs the cumulative income of the bottom-income &quot;x&quot;% of the population, for all &quot;x&quot; from 0 to 100. However, when commenting on the data, it can be expressed as the inverse, showing the percentage of income of the wealthiest &quot;x&quot;%.

An important and obvious property of the Lorenz curve is that, if country A has a higher cumulative national-income share for (say) the poorest 1%, in comparison to country B, then:
# If the two countries&#x27; Lorenz curves don&#x27;t cross, then country A&#x27;s Lorenz curve is everywhere higher than that of country B, meaning that, for any X from 0 to 100, the poorest X% of the population have a greater national-income-share in country A than in country B.
# If the two countries&#x27; Lorenz curves cross, then it&#x27;s a near-certainty that, on the poor side of the crossing-point, country A has a higher Lorenz curve, meaning that, for any poorest X% of the population up to the crossing-point, country A&#x27;s population has a greater national-income-share.

When inequality does harm, it does most of it at the poorer end of the population. At an any given income-ordered percentile, a greater national-income-share means a greater received percentage of the equal-share (the national mean income).

So the country with a greater cumulative national-income-share for the poorest 1% will have a greater cumulative received percentage of equal-share for the poorest X%, either for every percentile X, or (if the Lorenz curves cross), for the percentiles on the poorer side of the crossing-point.

Some sources report several Lorenz-curve data-points (cumulative national income-shares up to several percentiles).

As mentioned above, taking the ratio of income share to subpopulation size corresponds to a ratio of &quot;mean&quot; subpopulation income relative to &quot;mean&quot; income.

Because income distribution is generally positively skewed, mean is higher than median, so ratios to mean are lower than ratios to median. This is particularly used to measure that fraction of income accruing to top earners – top 10%, 1%, 0.1%, 0.01%, and also &quot;top 100&quot; earners or the like; in the US top 400 earners is 0.0002% of earners (2 in 1,000,000) – to study concentration of income – wealth condensation, or rather income condensation. For example, in the chart at right, US income share of top earners was approximately constant from the mid-1950s to the mid-1980s, then increased from the mid-1980s through 2000s; this increased inequality was reflected in the Gini coefficient.

For example, in 2007 the top decile (10%) of US earners accounted for 49.7% of total wages (formula_7 times fraction under equality), and the top 0.01% of US earners accounted for 6% of total wages (600 times fraction under equality).

== Approaches ==

=== Normative approach ===
Normative interpretation of inequality through inequality indexes means that there is a relationship between an inequality index and a social-evaluation ordering defined on the incomes — incomes (nominal or real) of the members of society. Incomes are typically assigned to individuals rather than households by using an adult equivalence scale.

Normative approach has been discussed by Charles Blackorby, Walter Bossert and David Donaldson in the work &quot;Income Inequality Measurement: The Normative Approach&quot;.

=== Statistical approach ===
Statistical interpretation of inequality is based on fiscal data and the parameter α from the model of Pareto (1895) as an income inequality measure. This approach is further discussed in work &quot;Income Inequality Measurement: The Statistical Approach&quot; by Giovanni M. Giorgi.

== Spreadsheet computations ==
The Gini coefficient, the Hoover index and the Theil index as well as the related welfare functions can be computed together in a spreadsheet. The welfare functions serve as alternatives to the median income.
In the table, fields with a yellow background are used for data input. From these data inequality measures as well as the related welfare functions are computed and displayed in fields with green background.

In the example given here, &quot;Theil index&quot; stands for the arithmetic mean of a Theil index computed for the distribution of income within a society to the individuals (or households) in that society and a Theil index computed for the distribution of the individuals (or households) in the society to the income of that society. The difference between the Theil index and the Hoover index is the weighting of the relative deviation D. For the Hoover index the relative deviation D per group is weighted with its own sign. For the Theil index the relative deviation D per group is weighted with the information size provided by the income per individual in that group.

For the computation the society usually is divided into income groups. Often there are four or five groups consisting of a similar number of individuals in each group. In other cases the groups are created based on income ranges which leads to having different numbers of individuals in the different groups. The table above shows a computation of inequality indices for four groups. For each group the number of individuals (or households) per group A and the total income in that group E is specified.

The parameter pairs A and E need to be sorted for the computation of the Gini coefficient. (For the Theil index and the Hoover index no sorting is required.) A and E have to be sorted so that the values in the column &quot;Income per individual&quot; are lined up in ascending order.

==Proper use==
# When using income metrics, it has to be made clear how income should be defined. Should it include capital gains, imputed house rents from home ownership, and gifts? If these income sources or alleged income sources (in the case of &quot;imputed rent&quot;) are ignored (as they often are), how might this bias the analysis? How should non-paid work (such as parental childcare or doing one&#x27;s own cooking instead of hiring a chef for every meal) be handled? Wealth or consumption may be more appropriate measures in some situations. Broader quality of life metrics might be useful.
# The comparison of inequality measures requires that the segmentation of compared groups (societies etc.) into quintiles should be similar.
# Distinguish properly, whether the basic unit of measurement is households or individuals. The Gini value for households is always lower than for individuals because of income pooling and intra-family transfers. And households have a varying number of members. The metrics will be influenced either upward or downward depending on which unit of measurement is used.
#Consider life cycle effects. In most Western societies, an individual tends to start life with little or no income, gradually increase income till about age 50, after which incomes will decline, eventually becoming negative. This affects the conclusions which can be drawn from a measured inequality. It has been estimated (by A.S. Blinder in &quot;The Decomposition of Inequality&quot;, MIT press) that 30% of measured income inequality is due to the inequality an individual experiences as they go through the various stages of life.
#Clarify whether real or nominal income distributions should be used. What effect will inflation have on absolute measures? Do some groups (e.g., pensioners) feel the effect of inflation more than others?
#When drawing conclusion from inequality measurements, consider how we should allocate the benefits of government spending? How does the existence of a social security safety net influence the definition of absolute measures of poverty? Do government programs support some income groups more than others?
#Inequality metrics measure inequality. They do not measure possible causes of income inequality. Some alleged causes include: life cycle effects (age), inherited characteristics (IQ, talent), willingness to take chances (risk aversion), the leisure/industriousness choice, inherited wealth, economic circumstances, education and training, discrimination, and market imperfections.
#Inequality metrics are anonymous. They ignore certain effects of income mobility, in which the identity of &quot;who is rich&quot; and &quot;who is poor&quot; is considered. For example, at a particular time, Alice may have $10 and Bob may have $2. At some time later, Bob may have $10 and Alice may have $2. The inequality index will be the same in both cases and rather high. However, the inequality of the average will be zero, since Alice&#x27;s and Bob&#x27;s average holdings are equal ($6). The $8 which has changed hands is a measure of wealth mobility and the average inequality is generally higher than the inequality of the average.

Keeping these points in mind helps to understand the problems caused by the improper use of inequality measures. However, they do not render inequality coefficients invalid. If inequality measures are computed in a well explained and &quot;consistent&quot; way, they can provide a good tool for quantitative comparisons of inequalities.

==Inequality, growth, and progress==
Evidence from a broad panel of recent academic studies shows that there is a nonlinear relation between income inequality and the rate of growth and investment. Very high inequality slows growth; moderate inequality encourages growth. Studies differ on the effect of very low inequality.

Barro, Harvard University found in his study &quot;Inequality and Growth in a Panel of Countries&quot; that higher inequality tends to retard growth in poor countries and encourage growth in well-developed regions. Underscoring the need for initiatives like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 10, aim at reducing inequality. According to Pak Hung Mo, income inequality has significant negative effect on the rate of GDP growth. In their work &quot;Income Inequality and Economic Growth&quot;, they found out that the most important is the transfer channel while the least important is the human capital channel. However, the direct impact of income inequality on the rate of productivity growth accounts for more than 55 percent of its overall total effect. This indicates that the effects of income inequality on economic growth are much more complicated than what we have perceived or modeled.

In their study for the World Institute for Development Economics Research, Giovanni Andrea Cornia and Julius Court (2001) reach slightly different conclusions. The authors therefore recommend to pursue moderation also as to the distribution of wealth and particularly to avoid the extremes. Both very high egalitarianism and very high inequality cause slow growth. Considering the inequalities in economically well developed countries, public policy should target an &#x27;efficient inequality range&#x27;. The authors claim that such efficiency range roughly lies between the values of the Gini coefficients of 0.25 (inequality close to the least unequal European counties) and 0.40 (close to the level of inequality of US.

According to the work &quot;Inequality of Opportunity, Income Inequality, and Economic Growth,&quot; the relationship between income inequality and economic growth is mediated by the level of equality of opportunity, as identified by intergenerational mobility. After a number of recently developed internationally comparable measures of intergenerational mobility they confirmed that the negative impact of income inequality on growth increases as intergenerational mobility decreases. The findings imply that excluding intergenerational mobility leads to misspecification, which explains why the empirical literature on income inequality and growth has been so inconclusive.

Another researcher has shown that in perfect markets inequality does not influence growth.

The precise shape of the inequality-growth curve obviously varies across countries depending upon their resource endowment, history, remaining levels of absolute poverty and available stock of social programs, as well as on the distribution of physical and human capital.

<text>The Sibylline Books () were a collection of oracular utterances, set out in Greek hexameter verses, that, according to tradition, were purchased from a sibyl by the last king of Rome, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, and consulted at momentous crises through the history of the Roman Republic and the Empire.

Only fragments have survived, the rest being lost or deliberately destroyed. The &quot;Sibylline Books&quot; are not the same as the &quot;Sibylline Oracles&quot;, which are fourteen books and eight fragments of prophecies thought to be of Judaeo-Christian origin.

==History==
According to the Roman tradition, the oldest collection of Sibylline books appears to have been made about the time of Solon and Cyrus at Gergis on Mount Ida in the Troad; it was attributed to the Hellespontine Sibyl and was preserved in the temple of Apollo at Gergis. From Gergis the collection passed to Erythrae, where it became famous as the oracles of the Erythraean Sibyl. It would appear to have been this very collection that found its way to Cumae (see the Cumaean Sibyl) and from Cumae to Rome.

The story of the acquisition of the &quot;Sibylline Books&quot; by the seventh and last king of Rome, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus (&quot;Tarquinius&quot;, ruled 534 to 509 B.C., d. 495 B.C.), is one of the famous legendary elements of Roman history. An old woman, possibly a Cumaean Sibyl, offered to Tarquinius nine books of these prophecies at an exorbitant price; when the king declined to purchase them, she burned three and offered the remaining six to Tarquinius at the same price, which he again refused. Thereupon, she burned three more and repeated her offer, maintaining the same price. Tarquinius then consulted the Augurs whose importance in Roman history is averred by Livy. The Augurs deplored the loss of the six books and urged purchase of the remaining three. Tarquinius then purchased the last three at the full original price, and had them preserved in a sacred vault beneath the Capitoline temple of Jupiter. The story is alluded to in Varro&#x27;s lost books quoted in Lactantius &quot;Institutiones Divinae&quot; (I: 6) and by Origen, and told by Aulus Gellius (&quot;Noctes Atticae&quot; 1, 19).

The Roman Senate kept tight control over the &quot;Sibylline Books&quot;, and entrusted them to the care of two patricians. In 367 BC, the number of custodians was increased to ten, five patricians and five plebeians, who were called the &quot;decemviri sacris faciundis&quot;. Subsequently, probably in the time of Sulla, their number was increased to fifteen, the &quot;quindecimviri sacris faciundis&quot;. They were usually ex-consuls or ex-praetors. They held office for life, and were exempt from all other public duties. They had the responsibility of keeping the books in safety and secrecy. The 15 individuals were custodians of the Sibylline Books that were kept on the Palatine. These officials, at the command of the Senate, consulted the &quot;Sibylline Books&quot; in order to discover not exact predictions of definite future events in the form of prophecy, but the religious observances necessary to avert extraordinary calamities and to expiate ominous prodigies (comets and earthquakes, showers of stones, plague, and the like). It was only the rites of expiation prescribed by the &quot;Sibylline Books&quot;, according to the interpretation of the oracle that were communicated to the public, and not the oracles themselves, which left ample opportunity for abuses. 

In particular, the keepers of the &quot;Sibylline Books&quot; had the superintendence of the worship of Apollo, of the &quot;Great Mother&quot; Cybele or Magna Mater, and of Ceres, which had been introduced upon recommendations as interpreted from the &quot;Sibylline Books&quot;. The &quot;Sibylline Books&quot; motivated the construction of eight temples in ancient Rome, aside from those cults that have been interpreted as mediated by the &quot;Sibylline Books&quot; simply by the Greek nature of the deity. Thus, one important effect of the &quot;Sibylline Books&quot; was their influence on applying Greek cult practice and Greek conceptions of deities to indigenous Roman religion, which was already indirectly influenced through Etruscan religion. As the &quot;Sibylline Books&quot; had been collected in Anatolia, in the neighborhood of Troy, they recognized the gods and goddesses and the rites observed there and helped introduce them into Roman state worship, a syncretic amalgamation of national deities with the corresponding deities of Greece, and a general modification of the Roman religion.

Since they were written in verse and in Greek, the college of curators was always assisted by two Greek interpreters. The books were kept in the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitol, and, when the temple burned in 83 BC, they were lost. The Roman Senate sent envoys in 76 BC to replace them with a collection of similar oracular sayings, in particular collected from Ilium, Erythrae, Samos, Sicily, and Africa. This new Sibylline collection was deposited in the restored temple, together with similar sayings of native origin, e.g. those of the Sibyl at Tibur (the &#x27;Tiburtine Sibyl&#x27;) of the brothers Marcius, and others, which had been circulating in private hands but which were called in, to be delivered to the Urban Praetor, private ownership of such works being declared illicit, and to be evaluated by the Quindecimviri, who then sorted them, retaining only those that appeared true to them. 

From the Capitol they were transferred by Augustus as &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; in 12 BC, to the Temple of Apollo Palatinus, after they had been examined and copied; there they remained until about AD 405. According to the poet Rutilius Claudius Namatianus, the general Flavius Stilicho (died AD 408) burned them, as they were being used to attack his government. The last known consultation was in 363 CE.

Some supposedly genuine Sibylline verses are preserved in the &quot;Book of Marvels&quot; or &quot;Memorabilia&quot; of Phlegon of Tralles (2nd century AD). These represent an oracle, or a combination of two oracles, of seventy hexameters in all. They report the birth of an androgyne, and prescribe a long list of rituals and offerings to the gods. Their authenticity has been questioned.

===Relationship with the &quot;Sibylline Oracles&quot;===
The &quot;Sibylline Oracles&quot; were quoted by the Roman-Jewish historian Josephus (late 1st century) as well as by numerous Christian writers of the second century, including Athenagoras of Athens who, in a letter addressed to Marcus Aurelius in ca. AD 176, quoted &quot;verbatim&quot; a section of the extant &quot;Oracles&quot;, in the midst of a lengthy series of other classical and pagan references such as Homer and Hesiod, stating several times that all these works should already be familiar to the Roman Emperor. Copies of the actual &quot;Sibylline Books&quot; (as reconstituted in 76 BC) were still in the Roman Temple at this time. The &quot;Oracles&quot; are nevertheless thought by modern scholars to be anonymous compilations that assumed their final form in the fifth century, after the &quot;Sibylline Books&quot; perished. They are a miscellaneous collection of Jewish and Christian portents of future disasters, that may illustrate the confusions about sibyls that were accumulating among Christians of Late Antiquity.

==Consultations of the Books cited in history==
An incomplete list of consultations of the &quot;Sibylline Books&quot; recorded by historians: 
* 461 BC: Strange signs, including a rain of meat, caused two officials to consult the books, which warned of a &quot;concourse of alien men&quot;, but the tribunes believed it to be a deliberate invention to halt progress on legal reforms. (Livy 3)
* 399 BC: The books were consulted following a pestilence, resulting in the institution of the &quot;lectisternium&quot; ceremony. (Livy 5, 13)
* 348 BC: A plague struck Rome after a brief skirmish with the Gauls and Greeks. Another lectisternium was ordered. (Livy 7, 27)
* 345 BC: The books were consulted when a &quot;shower of stones rained down and darkness filled the sky during daylight&quot;. Publius Valerius Publicola was appointed dictator to arrange a public holiday for religious observances. (Livy 7, 28)
* 295 BC: They were consulted again following a pestilence, and reports that large numbers of Appius Claudius&#x27; army had been struck by lightning. A Temple was built to Venus near the &quot;Circus Maximus&quot;. (Livy 10, 31)
* 293 BC: After yet another plague, the books were consulted, with the prescription being &#x27;that Aesculapius must be brought to Rome from Epidaurus&#x27;; however, the Senate, being preoccupied with the Samnite wars, took no steps beyond performing one day of public prayers to Aesculapius. (Livy 10, 47)
* 240/238 BC: The &quot;Ludi Florales&quot;, or &quot;Flower Games&quot;, were instituted after consulting the books.

* 216 BC: When Hannibal annihilated the Roman Legions at Cannae, the books were consulted, and on their recommendation, two Gauls and two Greeks were buried alive in the city&#x27;s marketplace.
* 205–204 BC: During the Second Punic War, upon consultation of the &quot;Sibylline Books&quot;, an image of Cybele was transferred from Pessinos (Pessinous or Pergamon) to Rome. An embassy was sent to Attalus I of Pergamon to negotiate the transfer. Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica and Claudia Quinta were said to have received the image of Cybele at Ostia on her arrival in 204 BC. Cybele&#x27;s image was placed within the Temple of Victory on the Palatine. In honour of Cybele a lectisternium was performed and her games, the Megalesia, were held. The image of Cybele was moved to the Temple of the Magna Mater in 191 BC when the temple was dedicated by Marcus Junius Brutus in the consulship of Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica. A fragment of Valerius Antias from Livy&#x27;s &quot;Ab Urbe Condita&quot; 36.36.4 records that Megalesia were again held in 191 BC and that &quot;[they] were the first to be held with dramatic performances&quot;.
* 143 BC: Frontinus relates a story in which the Decemvirs consulted the books on another matter and found that a proposed project for the Aqua Marcia was improper, along with the Anio. After a debate in the Senate the project was resumed, presumably the necessity for water outweighed the oracle. Sextus Julius Frontinus, Aqueducts of Rome, Book I, Ch 7.
* 63 BC: Believing in a prediction of the books that &#x27;three Cornelii&#x27; would dominate Rome, Publius Cornelius Lentulus Sura took part in the conspiracy of Catiline (Plutarch, &quot;Life of Cicero&quot;, XVII)
* 56 BC: As Romans deliberated sending a force to restore Ptolemy XII to the throne of Egypt, lightning struck the statue of Jupiter on the Alban Mount; the oracles were consulted, and one was found to read &quot;If the King of Egypt comes to you asking for assistance, refuse him not your friendship, yet do not grant him any army, or else you will have toil and danger&quot;. This considerably delayed Ptolemy&#x27;s return. (Dio Cassius &quot;History of Rome&quot; 39:15)
* 44 BC: According to Suetonius, a sibylline prediction that only a king could triumph over Parthia fueled rumors that Caesar, leader of the then republic, was aspiring to kingship. (&quot;Caesar&quot;, 79)
* 15 AD: When the Tiber river flooded the lower parts of Rome, one of the priests suggested consulting the books, but Emperor Tiberius refused, preferring to keep the divine things secret. (Tacitus, &quot;Annales&quot; I, 76)
* 64 AD: The Emperor Nero consulted them following the Great Fire of Rome. (Tacitus, &quot;Annales&quot; XV, 44)
* 271 AD: The books were consulted following the Roman defeat at Placentia by the Alamanni.
* 312 AD: Maxentius consulted the &quot;Sibylline Books&quot; in preparation for combat with Constantine, who had just taken all of Maxentius&#x27; northern Italian cities and was marching on Rome.
* 363 AD: Julian the Apostate consulted the books in preparation for marching against the Sassanids. The response mailed from Rome &quot;in plain terms warned him not to quit his own territories that year&quot;. (Ammianus Marcellinus, &quot;History of Rome&quot;, XXIII 1, 7)
* 405 AD: Stilicho ordered the destruction of the &quot;Sibylline Books&quot;, possibly because Sibylline prophecies were being used to attack his government in the face of the attack of Alaric I.

<doc id="537544" wikidata="Q3414714" url="?curid=537544" title="Quiripi language">
<text>Quiripi (pronounced , also known as Mattabesic, Quiripi-Unquachog, Quiripi-Naugatuck, and Wampano) was an Algonquian language formerly spoken by the indigenous people of southwestern Connecticut and central Long Island, including the Quinnipiac, Unquachog, Mattabessett (Wangunk), Podunk, Tunxis, and Paugussett (subgroups Naugatuck, Potatuck, Weantinock). It has been effectively extinct since the end of the 19th century, although Frank T. Siebert, Jr., was able to record a few Unquachog words from an elderly woman in 1932.

==Affiliation and dialects==
Quiripi is considered to have been a member of the Eastern Algonquian branch of the Algonquian language family. It shared a number of linguistic features with the other Algonquian languages of southern New England, such as Massachusett and Mohegan-Pequot, including the shifting of Proto-Eastern Algonquian * and * to and , respectively, and the palatalization of earlier * before certain front vowels. There appear to have been two major dialects of Quiripi: an &quot;insular&quot; dialect spoken on Long Island by the Unquachog and a &quot;mainland&quot; dialect spoken by the other groups in Connecticut, principally the Quinnipiac.

==Attestation==
Quiripi is very poorly attested, though some sources do exist. One of the earliest Quiripi vocabularies was a 67-page bilingual catechism compiled in 1658 by Abraham Pierson, the elder, during his ministry at Branford, Connecticut, which remains the chief source of modern conclusions about Quiripi. Unfortunately, the catechism was &quot;poorly translated&quot; by Pierson, containing an &quot;unidiomatic, non-Algonquian sentence structure.&quot; It also displays signs of dialect mixture. Other sources of information on the language include a vocabulary collected by the Rev. Ezra Stiles in the late 1700s and a 202-word Unquachog vocabulary recorded by Thomas Jefferson in 1791, though the Jefferson vocabulary also shows clear signs of dialect mixture and &quot;external influences.&quot; Additionally, three early hymns written circa 1740 at the Moravian Shekomeko mission near Kent, Connecticut, have been translated by Carl Masthay.

==Phonology==
Linguist Blair Rudes attempted to reconstitute the phonology of Quiripi, using the extant documentation, comparison with related Algonquian languages, as &quot;reconstructing forward&quot; from Proto-Algonquian. In Rudes&#x27; analysis, Quiripi contained the following consonant phonemes:


Quiripi&#x27;s vowel system as reconstituted by Rudes was similar to that of the other Southern New England Algonquian languages. It consisted of two short vowels and , and four long vowels , , , and .

<text>The Palacio de Bellas Artes (Palace of Fine Arts) is a prominent cultural center in Mexico City. It hosts performing arts events, literature events and plastic arts galleries and exhibitions (including important permanent Mexican murals). &quot;Bellas Artes&quot; for short, has been called the &quot;art cathedral of Mexico&quot;, and is located on the western side of the historic center of Mexico City which is close to the Alameda Central park.

Bellas Artes replaced the original National Theater, built in the late 19th century. The latter was demolished as part of urban redesign in Mexico City, and a more opulent building was planned to celebrate the centennial of the Mexican War of Independence in 1910. The initial design and construction was undertaken by Italian architect Adamo Boari in 1904, but complications arising from the soft subsoil and the political problem both before and during the Mexican Revolution, hindered then stopped construction completely by 1913. Construction resumed in 1932 under Mexican architect and was completed in 1934. It was then inaugurated on November 29, 1934.

The exterior of the building is primarily Art Nouveau and Neoclassical and the interior is primarily Art Deco. The building is best known for its murals by González Camarena, Diego Rivera, Siqueiros and others, as well as the many exhibitions and theatrical performances it hosts, including the Ballet Folklórico de México.

==History==
The oldest known structure on the site was the Convent of Santa Isabel, whose church was built in 1680. However, significant Mexica finds, such as a sacrificial altar in the shape of a plumed snake have been found here. The convent area suffered frequent drought during the early canal period and development here grew quickly. 

In spite of this, the convent remained until it was forcibly closed in the 1860s by the Reform Laws. It was replaced by a textile mill and lower-class housing.

A section of this housing, on Santa Isabel Alley, was torn down and replaced by the National Theater in the latter 19th century. During the late 19th century and very early 20th, this theatre was the site of most of Mexico City&#x27;s high culture, presenting events such as theatre, operettas, Viennese dance and more.

It was then decided to replace this building with a more opulent one for the upcoming Centennial of Mexican Independence celebrations in 1910. The old theatre was demolished in 1901, and the new theatre would be called the Gran Teatro de Ópera. The work was awarded to Italian architect Adamo Boari, who favored neoclassical and art nouveau styles and who is responsible for the Palacio del Correo which is across the street. Adamo Boari promised in October 1904 to build a grand metallic structure, which at that time only existed in the United States, but not to this size. The first stone of the building was placed by Porfirio Díaz in 1904. Despite the 1910 deadline, by 1913, the building was hardly begun with only a basic shell. One reason for this is that the project became more complicated than anticipated as the heavy building sank into the soft spongy subsoil. The other reason was the political and economic instability that would lead to the Mexican Revolution. Full hostilities suspended construction of the palace completely and Adamo Boari returned to Italy.

The project would sit unfinished for about twenty years. In 1932, construction resumed under Mexican architect . Mariscal completed the interior but updated it from Boari&#x27;s plans to the more modern Art Deco style. The building was completely finished in 1934, and was inaugurated on 29 November of that year. The inaugural work presented in the theatre was &quot;La Verdad Sospechosa&quot; by Juan Ruiz de Alarcón in 1934. In 1946, the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes (National Institute of the Fine Arts) was created as a government agency to promote the arts and was initially housed at the Museo Nacional de Artes Plásticas, the Museo del Libro and other places. It is now at the Palacio.

In this theatre, Maria Callas debuted in the opera &quot;Norma&quot; in 1950.

In 2002, the palace was the scene of the funeral of María Félix.

Since its initial construction, very little has been updated or modified. However, intensive renovation efforts were begun in 2009 for the upcoming 2010 celebrations. Much of the equipment and machinery is original from the early 20th century. Much of the technological equipment is being updated, especially in the theatre which needs computerized lights, sound systems and other improvements. Other work will improve the acoustics. Upgrades to the theatre will allow for multimedia shows which were not available before. The main hall has had no renovation or upgrade work since it opened in 1934. Renovations here will lessen the number of people the hall can accommodate but should make the area more comfortable.

==The building==
The palace has a mixture of a number of architectural styles; however, it is principally Art Nouveau and Art Deco. Art Nouveau dominates the exterior, which was done by Adamo Boari, and the inside is dominated by Art Deco, which was completed by Federico Mariscal. Since construction began in 1904, the theater (which opened in 1934) has sunk some four meters into the soft soil of Mexico City. The main facade, which faces Avenida Juárez, is made of white Italian Carrara marble. In the interior of the portal are sculptures by Italian Leonardo Bistolfi. It consists of &quot;Harmony&quot;, surrounded by &quot;Pain&quot;, &quot;Rage&quot;, &quot;Happiness&quot;, &quot;Peace&quot; and &quot;Love&quot;. Another portion of the facade contains cherubs and sculptures representing music and inspiration. On the plaza front of the building, designed by Boari, there are four Pegasus sculptures which were made by Spanish Agustí Querol Subirats. These had been in the Zocalo before being brought here. The roof covering the center of the building is made of crystal designed by Hungarian Géza Maróti and depicts the muses with Apollo. One aspect of the Palace which has since disappeared is the &quot;Pergola&quot;, which was located in the Alameda. It was constructed to house pictorial exhibitions for the 1910 celebrations, but it was demolished in 1973.

The interior is also surfaced in Carrara marble. It divides into three sections: the main hall with adjoining smaller exhibition halls, the theatre and the offices of the Insituto Nacional de Bellas Artes. The main hall is covered by the Marotti glass and iron roof. It and the balconies of all three upper floors can be seen from the ground floor below. In areas of the main hall, pre-Hispanic motifs done in Art Deco style, such as serpents’ heads on window arches and Maya Chaac masks on the vertical light panels distinguish this interior from its contemporaries. The smaller exhibition halls are located on the first and second floors. The first floor is decorated with crystal lamps, created by Edgar Brandt and hold murals by Rufino Tamayo. The Adamo Boari and Manuel M. Ponce halls hold music and literature events. And the National and International halls are for exhibitions. The second floor has smaller exhibition halls as well as murals by José Clemente Orozco, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Diego Rivera, Jorge González Camarena, Roberto Montenegro and Manuel Rodríguez Lozano. The third floor is occupied by the Museum of Architecture. The ironwork was designed in Italy by Alessandro Mazzucotelli and in Mexico by Luis Romero Soto.

At the entrance of the theatre, there are mascarons in bronze with depictions of Tlaloc, and Chaac, the Aztec and Maya deities of water, which along with the rest were designed by Gianette Fiorenzo. On the arch over the stage there are representations of various mythological personas such as the Muses with Apollo. This was constructed in Hungary in the workshops of Géza Maróti. However, the most impacting aspect is the stage &quot;curtain&quot; which is a stained glass foldable panel created out of nearly a million pieces of iridescent colored glass by Tiffany&#x27;s in New York. This stage curtain is the only one of its type in any opera house in the world and weighs 24 tons. The design of the curtain has the volcanos Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl in the center. Around them is a Mexican landscape surrounded by images of sculptures from Yautepec and Oaxaca. This design was inspired by work done by artist Gerardo Murillo (Dr. Atl). The theatre has a capacity of 1,590.

==Events==
The Palace has been the scene of some of the most notable events in music, dance, theatre, opera and literature and has hosted important exhibitions of painting, sculpture and photography. It has hosted some of the biggest names from both Mexico and abroad. It has hosted poetry events as well as those related to popular culture. Artists and companies are from all parts of Mexico and abroad. It has been called the &quot;Cathedral of Art in Mexico&quot;. It was declared an artistic monument in 1987 by UNESCO. The building is administered by the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes of the federal government. The palace receive on average 10,000 visitors each week.

Two of the best-known groups which regularly perform here are the Ballet Folklórico de México Compania Nacional de Opera de Bellas Artes and the National Symphonic Orchestra. The first performs in the theatre twice a week and is a spectacle of pre and post Hispanic dance of Mexico. A typical program includes Aztec ritual dances, agricultural dances from Jalisco, a fiesta in Veracruz, a wedding celebration — all accompanies by mariachis, marimba players and singers. Regular annual events include the Premio Quorum for Mexican designers in graphic and industrial materials and the Premios Ariel for Mexican films.

Numerous individual events have been held here. These include several exhibitions of Frida Kahlo&#x27;s work, and a number of appearances by Luciano Pavarotti. In 1987, Bellas Artes hosted a legendary performance of Jesusa Rodríguez&#x27;s &quot;Donna Giovanni&quot;, an adaptation of Mozart&#x27;s opera with a female cast. Other appearances have been made by Mexican baritone Jorge Lagunes (2002) and Catalan guitarist Joan Manuel Serrat (2003). Events that have been held here include &quot;ABCDF Palabras de Ciudad&quot; (2002) showing life in popular housing in photographs and video, &quot;Bordados del Mexico Antiguo&quot; (Embroidery of Old Mexico) showing processes, history and design, Rem Koolhaas Premio Pritzker 2000&quot; conference and &quot;Exchanging Views: Visions of Latin America&quot; which was an exhibit from the collection of Patricia Phelps de Cisneros comprising 148 works by 72 artists from across Latin America in 2006.

Occasionally, the plaza in front of the Palace is the scene of protests such as those against the Iraq War in 2003 and against bullfighting in 2010.

==Murals==
The floors between the ground floor and the uppermost floor are dominated by a number of murals painted by most of the famous names of Mexican muralism.

On the 2nd floor are two early-1950s works by Rufino Tamayo: México de Hoy (Mexico Today) and Nacimiento de la Nacionalidad (Birth of Nationality), a symbolic depiction of the creation of the mestizo (person of mixed indigenous and Spanish ancestry) identity.

At the west end of the 3rd floor is Diego Rivera&#x27;s El hombre controlador del universo (Man, controller of the universe- known as Man at the Crossroads), originally commissioned for New York&#x27;s Rockefeller Center in 1933. The mural depicts a variety of technological and societal themes (such as the discoveries made possible by microscopes and telescopes) and was controversial for its inclusion of Lenin and a Soviet May Day parade. The Rockefellers were not happy with the painting and the incomplete work was eventually destroyed and painted over. Rivera recreated it here in 1934. On the north side of the third floor are David Alfaro Siqueiros&#x27; three-part La Nueva Democracia (New Democracy) and Rivera&#x27;s four-part Carnaval de la Vida Mexicana (Carnival of Mexican Life); to the east is José Clemente Orozco&#x27;s La Katharsis (Catharsis), depicting the conflict between humankind&#x27;s &#x27;social&#x27; and &#x27;natural&#x27; aspects.

==Museo del Palacio de Bellas Artes==
The Museo del Palacio de Bellas Artes (&quot;Museum of the Palace of Fine Arts&quot;) is the organization that takes care of the permanent murals and other artwork in the building as well as arrange temporary exhibits. These exhibits cover a wide range of media and feature Mexican and international artists, focusing on classic and contemporary artists.

===Museo Nacional de Arquitectura===
The Museo Nacional de Arquitectura (&quot;Museum of Architecture&quot;) occupies the top floor of the building, covered by the glass and iron roof. It contains exhibitions from renowned Mexican architects including models, designs and photographs of major works. The museum also arranges temporary exhibitions of its collections in other facilities to expose the Mexican public to the country&#x27;s rich architectural heritage. Some of the major architects featured at the museum include Jaime Ortiz Monasterio, Carlos Mijares Bracho, Adamo Boari and Luis Barragán. The museum is divided into four sections called &quot;Arquitectura-contrastes: Jaime Ortiz Monasterio y Carlos Mijares Bracho&quot;, &quot;Corpus Urbanístico de la Ciudad de México&quot;, &quot;Teatro Nacional de México (Plano original)&quot; and &quot;Teatro Nacional de México.&quot; There are also temporary exhibits on contemporary architecture.

<text>Televisión Azteca, S.A.B. de C.V., commonly known as TV Azteca, is a Mexican multimedia conglomerate owned by Grupo Salinas. It is the second-largest mass media company in Mexico after Televisa. It primarily competes with Televisa as well as some local operators. It owns two national television networks, Azteca Uno and Azteca 7, and operates two other nationally distributed services, adn40 and A Más+. All three of these networks have transmitters in most major and minor cities.

TV Azteca also operates &quot;Azteca Trece Internacional&quot;, reaching 13 countries in Central and South America, and formerly part of the Azteca América network in the United States. Its flagship program is the newscast &quot;Hechos&quot;.

==History==
===Formation===
In the early 1990s, the presidency of Carlos Salinas de Gortari privatized many government assets. Among them was the Instituto Mexicano de la Televisión, known as Imevisión, which owned two national television networks (Red Nacional 7 and Red Nacional 13) and three local TV stations. In preparation for the privatization, the Imevisión stations were parceled into a variety of newly created companies, the largest of which was named Televisión Azteca, S.A. de C.V.

With the exception of Canal 22, which was spun off to Conaculta, one bidder won all of the stations. On July 18, 1993, Mexico&#x27;s Finance Ministry, the &quot;Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público&quot; (SHCP), announced that Radio Televisora del Centro, a group controlled by Ricardo Salinas Pliego, was the winner of the auction to acquire the &quot;state-owned media package&quot;, which also included Imevisión&#x27;s studios in the Ajusco area of Mexico City. The winning bid amounted to US$645 million. The new group soon took on the Televisión Azteca name for the entire operation and soon challenged Televisa, turning what had been a television monopoly into a television duopoly. The two conglomerates held 97 percent of the commercial television concessions in the country.

===Expansion===

In 1998, TV Azteca announced an investment of US$25 million in XHTVM-TV, which was owned by Javier Moreno Valle through concessionaire Televisora del Valle de México, S.A. de C.V. Under the deal, Azteca restructured TVM and took control of ad sales and most programming duties, while Moreno Valle&#x27;s CNI news service retained some primetime space. However, in 2000, Moreno Valle broke the contract with Azteca, alleging Azteca of filling up time allotted to CNI and not fulfilling the obligations in the contract. In December 2002, Azteca used private security guards to retake control of the XHTVM facilities on Cerro del Chiquihuite in Mexico City. However, the Mexican government stepped into the dispute and forced Azteca to relinquish control of XHTVM. In 2005, an employee strike that crippled CNI, Moreno Valle&#x27;s mounting legal troubles, and a deal with the 5% owner of the concessionaire allowed Azteca to buy the remainder of the station and retake control of XHTVM, under the name Proyecto 40, in 2006.
On March 7, 2011, TV Azteca changed its name to &quot;Azteca&quot;, reflecting its growth into a multimedia company. However, in May 2016, the TV Azteca name was restored.

TV Azteca is the second largest mass media company in México after Televisa. These two big organizations control the 97% of mass media in Mexico. TV Azteca was funded in 1993 by Ricardo Salinas Pliego. TV Azteca has 31% of the 465 television concessions in México. The auction of the state channels and the granting of further concessions to TV Azteca further strengthen their connection. It also owns Azteca banks, Azteca insurance, Iusacell, programing pay television, cinemas, live theater, news channels, newspapers, Azteca music, an acting school, Azteca consumer products, Azteca internet, Azteca series, Azteca sports, stadiums, etc. TV Azteca is another company which also serves the government however to a much lesser extent than Televisa. TV Azteca also receives lucrative contracts from the Mexican government, and therefore the information that emits is also controlled by the actual government. The news that is normally emitted by TV Azteca is 25% news bulletins that come from advertising, and infotainment relying on celebrities and biased editorials.

On March 21, 2023, creditors for the company pushed the company into an involuntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in the U.S. However, on April 26, TV Azteca asked the New York bankruptcy judge to dismiss its Chapter 11 case due to it being pointless to start reorganization proceedings for the company anywhere but Mexico. On June 1, 2023, TV Azteca was suspended from the Mexico Stock Exchange.

On 5 January 2005, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused TV Azteca executives (including chairman Ricardo Salinas Pliego) of having personally profited from a multimillion-dollar debt fraud committed by TV Azteca and another company in which they held stock. The charges were among the first brought under the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, introduced in the wake of the corporate financial scandals of that year.
The Federal Radio and Television Law (known as the Ley Televisa) was a bill concerning the licensing and regulation of the electromagnetic spectrum. The LFRT was favorable to both TV Azteca and Televisa (who together control 95 percent of all television frequencies) because it allowed them to renew their licenses without paying for them. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, the Ley Federal de Radio y Televisión &quot;raced through Congress confirming the country&#x27;s longstanding television duopoly&quot; and constituted a &quot;giveaway of radio spectrum and a provision that allows broadcasting licenses to be renewed more or less automatically&quot;.

In February 2012, TV Azteca networks (Azteca 7, Azteca 13, and Proyecto 40) were dropped by Mexican cable-TV carriers representing more than 4 million subscribers in a carriage dispute over terms. Cable operators claimed that Azteca wanted to charge a fee by packaging its over-the-air stations with cable networks, such as news and soap opera channels, which potentially represented a higher cost to subscribers. After a nine-month absence, TV Azteca returned gradually to cable operators.

In August 2018, American Tower&#x27;s Mexican Unit, MATC Infraestructura sued TV Azteca for $97 Million in a New York court for defaulting on a loan from the company.

== Holdings ==
TV Azteca is part of the conglomerate Grupo Salinas, which includes the Grupo Elektra franchise of department stores, the Banco Azteca bank, and Seguros Azteca life insurance. TV Azteca also owns Liga MX soccer club, Monarcas Morelia.

===Acting school===
The network has set up an acting school, Centro de Estudios y Formación Actoral (CEFAT). Alumni include Iliana Fox, Luis Ernesto Franco, Adriana Louvier, Fran Meric, Bárbara Mori, Laura Palma and Adrián Rubio.

===Record label===
The network also owns a record label, Azteca Music, which was founded in 1996.

<text>In cryptography, confusion and diffusion are two properties of a secure cipher identified by Claude Shannon in his 1945 classified report &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Cryptography&quot;. These properties, when present, work together to thwart the application of statistics, and other methods of cryptanalysis.

Confusion in a symmetric cipher is obscuring the local correlation between the input (plaintext), and output (ciphertext) by varying the application of the key to the data, while diffusion is hiding the plaintext statistics by spreading it over a larger area of ciphertext. Although ciphers can be confusion-only (substitution cipher, one-time pad) or diffusion-only (transposition cipher), any &quot;reasonable&quot; block cipher uses both confusion and diffusion. These concepts are also important in the design of cryptographic hash functions, and pseudorandom number generators, where decorrelation of the generated values is the main feature. Diffusion (and its avalanche effect) is also applicable to non-cryptographic hash functions.

==Definition==

===Confusion===

Confusion means that each binary digit (bit) of the ciphertext should depend on several parts of the key, obscuring the connections between the two.

The property of confusion hides the relationship between the ciphertext and the key.

This property makes it difficult to find the key from the ciphertext and if a single bit in a key is changed, the calculation of most or all of the bits in the ciphertext will be affected.

Confusion increases the ambiguity of ciphertext and it is used by both block and stream ciphers.

In substitution–permutation networks, confusion is provided by substitution boxes.

===Diffusion===

Diffusion means that if we change a single bit of the plaintext, then about half of the bits in the ciphertext should change, and similarly, if we change one bit of the ciphertext, then about half of the plaintext bits should change. This is equivalent to the expectation that encryption schemes exhibit an avalanche effect.

The purpose of diffusion is to hide the statistical relationship between the ciphertext and the plain text. For example, diffusion ensures that any patterns in the plaintext, such as redundant bits, are not apparent in the ciphertext. Block ciphers achieve this by &quot;diffusing&quot; the information about the plaintext&#x27;s structure across the rows and columns of the cipher.

In substitution–permutation networks, diffusion is provided by permutation boxes (a.k.a. permutation layer). In the beginning of the 21st century a consensus had appeared where the designers preferred the permutation layer to consist of linear Boolean functions, although nonlinear functions can be used, too.

==Theory==
In Shannon&#x27;s original definitions, &quot;confusion&quot; refers to making the relationship between the ciphertext and the symmetric key as complex and involved as possible; &quot;diffusion&quot; refers to dissipating the statistical structure of plaintext over the bulk of ciphertext. This complexity is generally implemented through a well-defined and repeatable series of &quot;substitutions&quot; and &quot;permutations&quot;. Substitution refers to the replacement of certain components (usually bits) with other components, following certain rules. Permutation refers to manipulation of the order of bits according to some algorithm. To be effective, any non-uniformity of plaintext bits needs to be redistributed across much larger structures in the ciphertext, making that non-uniformity much harder to detect.

In particular, for a randomly chosen input, if one flips the &quot;i&quot;-th bit, then the probability that the &quot;j&quot;-th output bit will change should be one half, for any &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;—this is termed the strict avalanche criterion. More generally, one may require that flipping a fixed set of bits should change each output bit with probability one half.

One aim of confusion is to make it very hard to find the key even if one has a large number of plaintext-ciphertext pairs produced with the same key. Therefore, each bit of the ciphertext should depend on the entire key, and in different ways on different bits of the key. In particular, changing one bit of the key should change the ciphertext completely.

==Practical applications==
Design of a modern block cipher uses both confusion and diffusion,
with confusion changing data between the input and the output by applying a key-dependent non-linear transformation (linear calculations are easier to reverse and thus are easier to break).

Confusion inevitably involves some diffusion, so a design with a very wide-input S-box can provide the necessary diffusion properties, but will be very costly in implementation. Therefore, the practical ciphers utilize relatively small S-boxes, operating on small groups of bits (&quot;bundles&quot;). For example, the design of AES has 8-bit S-boxes, Serpent − 4-bit, BaseKing and 3-way − 3-bit. Small S-boxes provide almost no diffusion, so the resources are spent on simpler diffusion transformations. For example, the wide trail strategy popularized by the Rijndael design, involves a linear mixing transformation that provides high diffusion, although the security proofs do not depend on the diffusion layer being linear.

One of the most researched cipher structures uses the substitution-permutation network (SPN) where each round includes a layer of local nonlinear permutations (S-boxes) for confusion and a linear diffusion transformation (usually a multiplication by a matrix over a finite field). Modern block ciphers mostly follow the confusion layer/diffusion layer model, with the efficiency of the diffusion layer estimated using the so-called branch number, a numerical parameter that can reach the value formula_1 for input bundles for the perfect diffusion transformation. Since the transformations that have high branch numbers (and thus require a lot of bundles as inputs) are costly in implementation, the diffusion layer is sometimes (for example, in the AES) composed from two sublayers, &quot;local diffusion&quot; that processes subsets of the bundles in a bricklayer fashion (each subset is transformed independently) and &quot;dispersion&quot; that makes the bits that were &quot;close&quot; (within one subset of bundles) to become &quot;distant&quot; (spread to different subsets and thus be locally diffused within these new subsets on the next round).

===Analysis of AES===
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) has both excellent confusion and diffusion. Its confusion look-up tables are very non-linear and good at destroying patterns. Its diffusion stage spreads every part of the input to every part of the output: changing one bit of input changes half the output bits on average. Both confusion and diffusion are repeated multiple times for each input to increase the amount of scrambling. The secret key is mixed in at every stage so that an attacker cannot precalculate what the cipher does.
None of this happens when a simple one-stage scramble is based on a key. Input patterns would flow straight through to the output. It might look random to the eye but analysis would find obvious patterns and the cipher could be broken.

<text>The NAIA men&#x27;s basketball national championship has been held annually by the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics since 1937 to determine the national champion of men&#x27;s college basketball among its members in the United States and Canada.

The tournament was established by James Naismith to crown a national champion for smaller colleges and universities and has been held every year since, with the exceptions of 1944 (due to World War II) and 2020 (due to the COVID-19 pandemic).

Since 2022, the tournament has featured 64 teams, with teams beginning play at one of sixteen regional sites with the winners of those regionals playing at the final venue.

From 1992 to 2020, the NAIA sponsored two championships, one for its Division I members and another for those in its Division II. The Division I tournament was played in Kansas City, Missouri while the Division II tournament moved locations several times (it finished, in 2020, at the Sanford Pentagon in Sioux Falls, South Dakota). During this time, the NAIA tournaments featured 32 teams with the entire events contested at one location in one week (rather than multiple locations over a series of weekends).

After the 2020 tournaments were cancelled, however, they were merged back into a single tournament, which initially featured 48 teams in 2021 before expanding to 64 teams in 2022.

All tournament games can be watched online through the official NAIA provider StretchInternet.

==History==
The Men&#x27;s Basketball Championship is mostly played at the Municipal Auditorium in Kansas City, Missouri. It has been held in Kansas City every year since the tournament began except from 1994 to 2001, when it was played in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and in 2020, when no tournament was held. Kansas City will continue to host until at least 2024.

In 2018, the NAIA announced a new format for the 2021 tournament after the merger of D-I and D-II. Under the new format, the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tournaments each involve 64 teams (the first post-COVID tournaments in 2021 had 48 teams). The first two rounds are played at 16 separate sites, with only the 16 winners at these sites advancing to Kansas City.

The tournament MVP has been presented with the Chuck Taylor Most Valuable Player award since 1939. In 1948, the NAIA became the first national organization to open their intercollegiate postseason to black student-athletes due primarily to the media attention surrounding the Manhatten Jaspers. Manhattan, who had an all-white team, learned of the NAIA rule that prohibited blacks from participating in the tournament, and after asking the NAIA to rescind the rule, the NAIA refused and Manhattan withdrew from the tournament. &quot;The battle might have ended there but for a man named Harry Henshel, who was a member of the U.S. Olympic basketball committee. One of the reasons that the NAIA tournament was so prestigious was that the champion was invited to compete at the Olympic trials in New York City in late March. (The other teams invited were the two NCAA finalists, three teams from the Amateur Athletic Union, the winner of the National Invitation Tournament, and a YMCA team.)&quot; After reading in the New York papers that blacks could not participate in the tournament, Henshel suggested to the media that the NAIA national champion be eliminated from Olympic consideration. NAIA officials read Hershel’s statement in the papers and quickly took a telegraphic poll amongst its members the following day that rescinded the racial ban. In 1947, Coach John Wooden of Indiana State refused the invitation to the NAIA National Tournament primarily because Clarence J. Walker, the only black player on his team could not participate. Because of the stance taken by Manhattan and Harry Hansel, in 1948, Coach Wooden was able to take Walker to the tournament who became the first African-American student-athlete to play in the NAIA tournament. Walker, a vital role player, helped the Sycamores finish as the NAIA&#x27;s national finalist. In 1957, Tennessee State became the first historically black college to win a national championship, and the first team to win three consecutive tournaments. As of 2017, Kentucky State is the only other school to do so (1970, 1971, 1972). Oklahoma City holds the record for the most tournament championships with six. OCU also holds the record for most national championship titles in NAIA women&#x27;s basketball.

<doc id="537559" wikidata="Q3198013" url="?curid=537559" title="Knightswood">
<text>Knightswood is a suburban district in the West End Of Glasgow, containing three areas: Knightswood North or High Knightswood, Knightswood South or Low Knightswood, and Knightswood Park. It has a golf course and park, and good transport links with the rest of the city. and railway stations serve Low Knightswood while Westerton station serves High Knightswood. Knightswood is directly adjoined by the Anniesland, Blairdardie, Drumchapel, Garscadden, Jordanhill, Netherton, Scotstoun, Scotstounhill and Yoker areas of Glasgow, and by Bearsden in the north.

Knightswood was a rural area of Dunbartonshire in the parish of New Kilpatrick with small-scale mining until the land was purchased for housing by the city of Glasgow and was annexed by the city in the 1920s. In subsequent years, housing developments were built on most of the remaining free plots (including two clusters of tower blocks – eleven in total, two since demolished), but the area remains largely green in line with garden suburb principles, with the only businesses based in small or medium-sized retail units. There are a number of churches and various community events are run throughout the year. Knightswood has a purpose-built BMX stadium in the local park, allowing the area to host international cycling events, such as the 2018 European BMX Championships and the 2023 UCI Cycling World Championships.

== History ==
Knightswood features on maps by Ordnance Survey cartographer William Roy dating back to 1748–55, which show it lying within the parish of New Kilpatrick in Dumbartonshire. The modern area is defined at its northern edge by the Forth and Clyde Canal (beyond which is Bearsden) which began construction in the 1760s and opened as the Great Canal in 1790. Drumchapel and Yoker lie to the west, beyond Duntreath Avenue and Yoker Mill Road. At its southern edge, Knightswood is bounded by Anniesland Road, beyond which lies Jordanhill and Scotstoun. Netherton and Temple lie to the east. Both of these settlements (with Jordanhill and Scotstoun) appear on Joan Blaeu&#x27;s 1662 Atlas of Scotland, but Knightswood is not shown, either omitted or not yet of significance. The earliest recorded settlement (1740) in the Knightswood area was known as the Red Town, a small village supporting ironstone miners and brickmakers.

Just before the First World War, Knightswood consisted of an Infectious Diseases Hospital (founded 1877) with a line of terraced cottages to the north called Knightswood Rows, a few houses on the site of Knightswood Secondary School (all that remained of Red Town), but the area was otherwise unpopulated farmland and disused mineworkings.

Great Western Road was constructed under government patronage between 1924 and 1927 from Anniesland Cross to Duntocher, north of Clydebank. Much of the housing in the area was constructed in three phases during the 1920s and 1930s on garden suburb principles. This housing was mainly of cottage flat and semi-detached types, and is similar to other parts of the city such as Mosspark in the South Side and Carntyne in the East End and used for the relocation of people from slum tenements cleared near the city centre. Land surrounding the junction of Great Western Road and Knightswood Road was designated for the use of several church denominations, and the nearby Knightswood Park, but there were no designated industrial areas or public houses, which remained in adjacent Temple and Scotstoun/Yoker.

In 1926, the district was brought under the official control of the city of Glasgow, which had purchased land outside its existing boundary from the Summerlee Iron Company for the building of the estate. During the Second World War, Knightswood Hospital treated wounded soldiers.

Knightswood, along with Jordanhill and Temple have been linked to stories of the Knights Templar; but according to the late Lord Lyon King of Arms there is no evidence for their presence in this area. Nevertheless, the theories continue to persist and are sometimes actively encouraged, as in the use of &quot;heraldic&quot; local street names (Archerhill Road, Arrowsmith Avenue, Ivanhoe Road, Minstrel Road, Talisman Road, Templar Avenue, Turret Road) by Glasgow Corporation, even though Knightswood only appears in the records from the 18th century, long after the days of knights.

Immediately following the war, spare land on the estate was used for temporary housing in the form of prefabs. These were replaced in the 1960s with high-rise buildings. In 1958, Glasgow Corporation opened a Fire Station which now houses a specialist water rescue unit.

Knightswood Hospital gradually lost services to other Glasgow Hospitals from the 1960s onwards, ending up as a Geriatric Unit and finally closing in March 2000. The hospital site is now the Academy Park residential development. In 2008, Knightswood gained a new church congregation at Knightswood Cross when the Free Church of Scotland (Continuing) moved from temporary premises in Thornwood to the former Brethren Gospel Hall.

In the 2010s, concerns were raised that some of the land of Knightswood was liable to flooding in times of extreme rainfall, which had been increasingly common in recent times and was considered likely to continue; in 2019, plans were outlined to have prevention measures put in place.

== Community events ==

Glasgow City Council run Knightswood Park Gala Day, an event for council and community groups in the area. It has been held on a Saturday at some time during the summer since 2008. The first event on 12 July 2008 was supported by Glasgow City Council, Strathclyde Fire Brigade, local churches (St David&#x27;s Church of Scotland and Knightswood Baptist Church) and local clubs.

The second Gala Day took place on 27 June 2009. The event started with the arrival of the Kingsway carnival parade at midday. There were demonstrations of falconry and sheepdog trials (herding Indian Runner Ducks due to space restrictions), live music, live entertainment, bouncy castles, stalls promoting community groups and clubs, Baptist church and fire brigade (as 2008). On site catering was provided this year, and first-aid cover was provided by St. Andrew&#x27;s Ambulance Association.

In 2010 and 2011, Trinley Brae Allotments took part in the Open Gates event as part of Glasgow&#x27;s Doors Open Day. This has developed links with the local community and other community events have taken place since the first event in September 2010. Members are currently researching the history of the allotment site and have the worked with the city council on other community events.

== Facilities ==

Knightswood caters for its residents with a community centre, library, secondary and primary schools. Knightswood Swimming Pool, opened in 1971, was permanently closed in March 2010. Construction of Scotland&#x27;s only Olympic standard BMX racing track was undertaken in Knightswood Park; the facility was used to host the 2018 European Championships, and means that Glasgow is the only city in the world that can host all four Olympic cycling disciplines (BMX, MTB, Road and Track) within its boundaries (the others are the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome at the Emirates Arena (Track), Cathkin Braes Mountain Bike Trails and the city&#x27;s streets for road races as used during the 2014 Commonwealth Games). These facilities were put to use again in the 2023 UCI Cycling World Championships. 

Knightswood Secondary School is also home to the Dance School of Scotland. Shopping in Knightswood can be done in many places, mostly in Knightswood Shopping Centre, an area comprising around 10 shops. There are also some shops on Alderman Road, both at Dyke Road and near the community centre. Trinley Brae Allotments (between Knightswood Road and Turret Crescent) provide space for local residents to grow their own fruit, vegetables and flowers. Children&#x27;s &amp; Youth Clubs are operated locally for school age children on Thursdays in the south of the area at the Congregational church and Fridays in the North at the Baptist Church.

== Churches and places of worship ==

Several denominations of churches are situated in the area of Knightswood Cross (junction of Knightswood Road and Great Western Road).
The Church of Scotland is represented locally by St. David&#x27;s Parish Church and St. Margaret&#x27;s Parish Church.
Knightswood Baptist Church has been at its current site since 1929.
Episcopalian (now closed), Roman Catholic, United Free Church of Scotland and Free Church of Scotland (Continuing) churches are all nearby.
Low Knightswood is served by Knightswood Congregational church

<doc id="537560" wikidata="Q126680" url="?curid=537560" title="Doomsday (DC Comics)">
<text>Doomsday is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Dan Jurgens, the character first made a cameo appearance in &quot;&quot; #17 (November 1992) before being fully introduced in &quot;Superman: The Man of Steel&quot; #18 (December 1992). He has become one of Superman&#x27;s most enduring enemies belonging to the collective of adversaries that make up his rogues gallery.

Doomsday ranked as #46 on IGN&#x27;s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time. He is best known as the character that killed Superman in &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; story arc &quot;Doomsday!&quot;. He appears in the film &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;, where he was portrayed by Robin Atkin Downes through voice acting and motion capture.

==Publication history==

Doomsday was conceived in 1991 during an annual brainstorming session with the editors and writers of Superman comics, in response to a concern by some writers that most of Superman&#x27;s foes at this point either relied on technology or their intellect to outmaneuver Superman or had some natural advantage against him, wanting to create a new foe with great physical power to match him. Several writers proposed having Superman die at the hands of a &quot;bestial foe&quot;, and editor Mike Carlin scribbled this idea on the wall chart as &quot;doomsday for Superman&quot;. Inspired, they chose &quot;Doomsday&quot; as the name for this villain.

Doomsday had a cameo appearance in &quot;&quot; #17 (November 1992) and made his first full appearance in &quot;&quot; #18 (December 1992).

==Fictional character biography==
Doomsday is depicted as a monstrous genetically engineered being from the depths of prehistoric Krypton. His creator imbued him with few feelings, mostly hate and desire for destruction, which led to his destroying worlds and eventually finding Earth, where he met Superman. The character is best known as Superman&#x27;s killer in the 1992 storyline, &quot;The Death of Superman&quot;.

===&quot;The Ultimate Killing Machine&quot;===
Originally known as &quot;The Ultimate,&quot; Doomsday was born in prehistoric times on Krypton, long before the humanoid Kryptonian race gained dominance over the planet about 250,000 years ago. It was at that time a violent, hellish world, where only the absolute strongest of creatures could survive. In a cruel experiment involving evolution, intended to create the perfect living being, the alien scientist Bertron released a humanoid infant (born in vitro in a lab) onto the surface of the planet, where he was promptly killed by the harsh environment. The baby&#x27;s remains were collected and used to clone a stronger version. This process was repeated over and over for decades as a form of accelerated natural evolution. The agony of these repeated deaths was recorded in his genes, driving the creature insane and to hate all life.
As it evolved, the child eventually became able to survive the high temperatures and searing atmosphere, only to be quickly slain by the vicious predators that inhabited the planet. Over time, and without the assistance of Bertron&#x27;s technology, he gained the ability to thrive on solar energy without the need for food or air, to return to life and adapt to overcome whatever had previously killed him. The Ultimate hunted and exterminated the dangerous predators of Krypton. He then killed Bertron, whom he had come to identify as an enemy.

The Ultimate escaped Krypton via a ship that regularly arrived to deliver supplies to Bertron (who had wanted little contact with the planet&#x27;s natives) and went on a killing spree across several planets. It began 245,000 years earlier on planet Bylan 5, where Apokoliptian prince Uxas (the future Darkseid) was about to wed a princess (to obtain that planet&#x27;s chemical deposits for Apokolips&#x27;s weapons factories). The Ultimate killed Uxas&#x27; ally Master Mayhem almost instantly and instilled great fear in Uxas, having watched their fight. Just as the Ultimate and Uxas were about to meet in combat, Uxas was forced to flee; the Ultimate&#x27;s rampage had caused the planet&#x27;s atmosphere to become toxic, thereby rendering the chemicals worthless to Apokolips. The Ultimate hitched a ride on an escaping shuttle, which crashed on Khundia. The warring Khundian clans united to build protective armor for a warrior named Kobald, who they hoped would survive long enough to force the Ultimate onto a rocket. Once the rocket was in space, the Ultimate killed Kobald and the resulting explosion sent him hurtling through space.

He next crossed paths with a Green Lantern named Zharan Pel, beating him to death. The Ultimate took the Lantern&#x27;s power ring and, sensing the power of the Guardians of the Universe, headed towards them. The thousands of Green Lanterns that were sent to stop him were slaughtered. He continued to Oa, where a single Guardian fought him. Wary of the others joining the fight, fearing the Ultimate would absorb their powers as he believed was happening to his powers, he, as a last resort, sacrificed himself in battle to defeat him. The release of energies by the Guardian caused a tear in space through which the Ultimate fell.

Eventually arriving on the planet Calaton, he ravaged that world for three years. With only the capital city left, the royal family combined their life forces into a single energy being, the Radiant. The Radiant killed the Ultimate with a huge blast of energy, laying waste to over a fifth of his planet in the process. In common Calatonian burial procedures, the Ultimate&#x27;s seemingly dead body was suited and shackled to prevent his spirit from escaping into the afterlife, and he was shot into space because the murders he committed made him unworthy of burial on Calaton. Eventually, his metallic casket crashed on Earth, the force of the impact driving it deep underground.

===&quot;The Death of Superman&quot;===
After freeing one arm and breaking out of his buried vault, The Ultimate went on a rampage in Midwestern America, where he first encountered the Justice League. He defeated the entire team of superheroes in a matter of minutes, which attracted the attention of Superman. Most notable is that the creature fought the whole time literally with one hand tied behind his back (due to his ancient burial cables), yet was still able to lay waste to all opposition and much of the surrounding area. The only Justice Leaguer who could defend herself against the creature was Maxima. The creature gained its new name when League member Booster Gold remarked that the rampage resembled &quot;the arrival of Doomsday&quot;. The comment reached the broadcast media and led to the creature becoming known by its new name of Doomsday. Five Leaguers, including Superman, combined their energy powers to take down Doomsday, but succeeded only in destroying the last of his burial cables, allowing him to use both hands, thus worsening the crisis.

During his rampage, Doomsday&#x27;s interest was captured by billboards and television spots advertising violent wrestling competitions held in Metropolis, which appealed to his blood lust and enticed the otherwise mindless creature to head towards the city. In counterattacking the creature, Superman found that his opponent&#x27;s power was more than a match for his own and was getting stronger. He realized that if Doomsday actually reached Metropolis, the resulting battle could conceivably destroy the city and kill millions of innocent people. Doomsday developed a strong desire to murder Superman, a desire that was later explained in the &quot;Hunter/Prey&quot; miniseries: &quot;from the agony of continually dying during his creation process, Doomsday developed in his genes the ability to sense anyone Kryptonian, as well as an overriding instinct to treat any such being as an automatic threat&quot;.

In the space of a few issues of the Superman comic book series, Doomsday battled Superman in a titanic struggle, leading the hero to conclude that the creature would continue to attack relentlessly and endlessly, with no fear or compassion. Matters came to a head in &quot;Superman&quot; (vol. 2) #75, wherein both Doomsday and Superman beat each other to death in front of the Daily Planet building in Metropolis.

Following the battle, four super-beings appeared and took up Superman&#x27;s mantle, two of them declaring themselves to be the real Superman. One was a half-man/half-machine who greatly resembled Superman with cybernetic implants where Superman had sustained the greatest amount of damage from Doomsday&#x27;s blows. This &quot;Superman&quot; took custody of Doomsday&#x27;s body. After strapping the body to an asteroid with an electronic device attached, the Cyborg Superman flung Doomsday into deep space on a trajectory supposedly certain to never intersect any other planet. The issue ended with a panel of a reawakened and laughing Doomsday, still chained to the asteroid but otherwise alive.

===Rematch: &quot;Hunter/Prey&quot;===
After passing through a wormhole, Doomsday&#x27;s asteroid was found by a deep-space scavenger ship en route to Apokolips. Doomsday was fully rested and, after slaughtering the crew of the salvage ship, found himself landing on Apokolips. This was to be the setup for a final showdown between Doomsday and Superman, who had been uneasy about the possibility of Doomsday&#x27;s resurrection. With the help of his Justice League contacts, Superman procured a Mother Box after Darkseid&#x27;s servant DeSaad contacted Earth about a problem on Apokolips.

Unknown to Superman, Doomsday had faced and beaten Darkseid in single combat despite his improved powers, even after withstanding the full effect of Darkseid&#x27;s Omega Beams and was laying waste to Apokolips. Before Superman could deal with Doomsday, DeSaad opened a Boom Tube to Calaton – the first world where Doomsday was successfully defeated – and sent Doomsday through to what he believed was his defeat at the hands of the Radiant. Doomsday was able to adapt, however, and overcome any opponent because of the process by which he was created, so, although the Radiant had defeated him once, he would not be able to defeat him again. Likewise, even though Superman had killed Doomsday once before, he was unable to do so again. Superman, while knowing this – having learned Doomsday&#x27;s history by Waverider – was obsessed with stopping Doomsday and followed him to Calaton. He fought Doomsday again with the help of the Mother Box, but, despite it providing him with extra weapons such as an ultrasonic gun and an energy sword, Superman met with defeat as Doomsday&#x27;s evolutions rendered him immune to Superman&#x27;s attacks, such as his auditory channels being sealed by new bone growths or his knuckle-bones being able to shoot out of his body to &#x27;pin&#x27; Superman in the air. Eventually, with his left arm having suffered a compound fracture and most of his weapons lost, Superman was forced to use one of Waverider&#x27;s time travel devices to leave Doomsday stranded at the End of Time, where Doomsday met the one force he could not overcome: entropy. Upon returning Superman to the present, the Mother Box healed Superman&#x27;s injuries and then &quot;died&quot;. On Apokolips, Darkseid, despite being beaten to near-death by Doomsday, became fascinated with him after witnessing his abilities first-hand and learning his origin from Waverider.

===&quot;The Doomsday Wars&quot;===
Doomsday returned yet again in the miniseries &quot;The Doomsday Wars&quot;. In this series, Prin Vnok, an underling of Brainiac, uses his technology to travel to the End of Time to retrieve Doomsday to combine the beast&#x27;s massive power with Brainiac&#x27;s formidable intellect after Brainiac&#x27;s original body was badly injured in his last fight with Superman (this was explained as having taken place at the time of the timeline&#x27;s reconstruction following the events of &quot;Zero Hour&quot;; the reconstruction of time meant that Brainiac was able to change the events of Doomsday&#x27;s defeat). He was unable to erase Doomsday&#x27;s consciousness with drugs, however, because he reacted too fast for the process to work. With Doomsday&#x27;s strength of will too strong for Brainiac to permanently overwhelm him on his own, Brainiac instead chose to use a human host to genetically engineer a Doomsday clone without the mind of the original, while temporarily lodging in Doomsday&#x27;s head to use the creature&#x27;s strength until he would be forced out. He chose to use Pete Ross and Lana Lang&#x27;s newborn baby, born eight weeks premature and transported by Superman to a hospital. Brainiac intercepted Superman and stole the baby to hurt his long-time foe, correctly deducing that it was the child of someone close to Superman and feeling that the baby&#x27;s still-malleable DNA would make him ideal for the plan. In the end, Superman thwarted Brainiac&#x27;s plot by driving him out of Doomsday&#x27;s body via the use of a telepathy-blocking &quot;psi-blocker&quot;, simultaneously rescuing the baby from Brainiac&#x27;s equipment after his foe&#x27;s treatments brought the child to full-term before infusing him with Doomsday&#x27;s DNA. He then lured Doomsday to the moon, where he placed him in a kind of stasis with four Justice League teleporters. Perpetually transporting between those four booths, Doomsday would never be more than 25% integrated, and was thus unable to escape.

===&quot;Our Worlds at War&quot;===
Following these events, Doomsday was released by Manchester Black&#x27;s Suicide Squad to battle Imperiex, a cosmic entity. Once freed, Doomsday slaughtered the Squad, then went on to battle Imperiex&#x27;s probes. Doomsday tore through numerous probes with seemingly little effort, while aided by Superman – the only time the two enemies would come close to teaming up – before finally confronting Imperiex. Imperiex proved too much for Doomsday, who was reduced to a skeleton.

===Sentience===
&quot;Superman&quot; (vol. 2) #175 commemorated the 100th issue since the death of Superman in battle with Doomsday, by staging a rematch. Doomsday&#x27;s skeleton was retrieved and his flesh regrown by Lex Luthor using Superman&#x27;s Kryptonian DNA, who gave Doomsday to Darkseid to repay Earth&#x27;s war debt to Apokolips (Darkseid sought to control Doomsday since their last encounter). By this time, Doomsday had evolved sentience. Luthor arranged for the Joker to set Doomsday loose in Washington, D.C., to demonstrate that he was &quot;in good working condition&quot;. It also happened to be the anniversary of the day that Superman had died while stopping Doomsday. Despite being weakened by kryptonite exposure when Luthor attempted to exploit Doomsday&#x27;s Kryptonian origins, Superman&#x27;s heart was restarted by Black Lightning and he reached Doomsday just as the monster was struggling with Martian Manhunter. Learning from J&#x27;onzz that Doomsday wanted to kill Luthor because he blamed Luthor for his &quot;death&quot; in the Imperiex War, Superman would soon fight Doomsday again and, this time, humbly defeat the creature by knocking him out and proving to himself and the world that Doomsday would never again be Superman&#x27;s equal.

Darkseid attempted to replicate Doomsday, producing an army of Doomsday &quot;clones&quot;. Darkseid was unable to duplicate perfectly the creature in all its raw power but still used the replicates as his foot soldiers, typically for diversions or intimidations. They were defeated by a combination of heat vision and Batman&#x27;s batarangs during an attack on Paradise Island, while Darkseid kidnapped Supergirl.

When Superman travels to Apokolips to reclaim the life of Steel, Darkseid&#x27;s wife Mortalla orders his troops to release Doomsday to help Darkseid. Doomsday&#x27;s short freedom was quickly halted by Steel in the Entropy Aegis, an armor with incredible power that had been built out of the remains of an Imperiex probe. Doomsday disappeared and was seen wandering the harsh lands of Apokolips.

With his newfound intelligence, Doomsday escapes Apokolips and returns to Earth. He assists Superman in battling Gog and is viewed as a hero in the future.

===Infinite Crisis===
In &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Doctor Psycho and Warp free Doomsday from a cavern near the center of the Earth and mind-control him into serving them. He is defeated by Superman and his Earth-Two counterpart.

===New Krypton===
Doomsday returns in &quot;Superman&quot; #681, crashing in Metropolis shortly after the representatives of Kandor meet with the President. He is killed in battle with Superman, Supergirl, and the Kandorians. Afterward, Sam Lane obtains Doomsday&#x27;s corpse and tasks Lex Luthor with upgrading him.

===Reign of Doomsday===
During the &quot;Reign of Doomsday&quot; storyline, Doomsday returned to carve a new path of destruction throughout the DC Universe. His journey started in the Steel one-shot and continued into &quot;Outsiders&quot; (vol. 4) #37, &quot;Justice League of America&quot; (vol. 2) #55, &quot;Superman/Batman&quot; Annual #5, &quot;Superboy&quot; (vol. 4) #6 and into the milestone &quot;Action Comics&quot; #900. Doomsday, exhibiting an increased, broadened power set which seemed to adapt to each of his opponents, attacked, defeated and abducted Steel, the Cyborg Superman, the Eradicator, Supergirl, and Superboy, before taking them to a cloaked satellite at the former location of New Krypton. Superman discovered that this was all part of a plot by Lex Luthor. After locating the satellite, Superman attempted to free his allies, only for them all to discover the apparently still-inert body of Doomsday, as well as three separate clones, each with a different power set.

Attempting to flee from the clones with Doomsday, the Superman Family discovered that their ship was on course for Earth with the potential to trigger an extinction-level event if it were to strike. Their attempt to divert the ship was interrupted by a being called &quot;Doomslayer&quot;, who resembled a cyborg version of Doomsday and was later revealed to be a Doomsday clone who was tossed down an infinite tube that gave it time to evolve. Doomslayer effortlessly tore Eradicator apart and proclaimed that Earth must die for the future.

Doomslayer believed the original Doomsday to be an infection, so it planned to destroy Earth, as it considered Earth to be ground zero for Doomsday&#x27;s &quot;infection&quot;. Superman and his friends escaped the ship with the original Doomsday and stopped the ship from crashing onto Earth, pushing it into Metropolis&#x27;s bay. Afterward, Doomslayer attacked the city with the Doomsday clones, determined to erase all trace and knowledge of Doomsday from existence.

The clones spread across the world, wreaking havoc, while Doomslayer&#x27;s second plan was to entice the Doomsdays to reach the Earth&#x27;s core so that he could expand the universe inside the ship&#x27;s tower and destroy the planet from within, thus erasing all knowledge of Doomsday from the universe. In S.T.A.R. Labs, Superman&#x27;s allies used the original Doomsday&#x27;s body to try to find a way to stop the Doomsday clones. Doomsday awakened, but Eradicator (who was thought to be killed by Doomslayer) was in control. As Eradicator and the heroes attacked the Doomsday clones, he warned that Doomsday&#x27;s mind was beginning to awaken.

In the final battle, a weakened Superman made contact with the ship&#x27;s artificial intelligence before it reached Earth&#x27;s core, hoping to have the tower teleport away. Meanwhile, the Doomsday clones were defeated by Earth&#x27;s heroes and sent back into the pit in which the tower was located. Eradicator arrived and defended Superman, now very weak, from Doomslayer, quickly throwing Superman out of the tower and allowing himself to be trapped with Doomslayer before the tower teleported away.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===

In &quot;The New 52&quot; (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Doomsday made his official debut in September 2013 as a part of &quot;Villains Month&quot;. In &quot;Batman/Superman&quot; #3.1, Doomsday attacked Krypton many years ago when Lara was a lieutenant in the elite military seminary. Colonel Zod faced him wearing an ancient armor of Krypton&#x27;s warrior founders but their battle caused the death of thousands of Kryptonians. Zod apparently defeated Doomsday, sending him to the Phantom Zone. Years later, General Zod, now also imprisoned in the Phantom Zone, communicated with the child Kara Zor-El, telling her how he admired the creature because it destroyed everything, an attribute he sought for his people to be strong as years of complacency had made the Kryptonians weak. Zor-El narrated a prophecy in which the last knight of the House of El will travel to a distant planet after the destruction of Krypton. The last knight will be found by Doomsday later and will battle him to save his people, sacrificing his own life to do so.

In &quot;Superman/Wonder Woman&quot;, Doomsday mysteriously appears in the North Atlantic Ocean and fights Wonder Woman, breaking her arm before vanishing. After describing her attacker to Superman, both travel to the Fortress of Solitude where Diana identifies Doomsday on a Phantom Zone viewing device. Superman assumes that the walls of the Phantom Zone are failing, which has allowed the momentary escapes for Doomsday.

Months later, the creature once again escapes the Phantom Zone to wreak havoc across the globe, changing into an even deadlier form; now, every living thing in its vicinity dies, and even physical structures crumble. Superman, Wonder Woman, Steel, and the Justice League struggle to defeat it, even calling on the aid of Lex Luthor; in the end, Superman drags Doomsday&#x27;s body to the planet Venus and incinerates it. Believing Doomsday dead, Superman returns to Earth, only to watch in horror as the creature teleports there. Finally realizing he has no choice, Superman kills Doomsday, slicing the monster in half and, as it disintegrates, inhaling its ash-like remains to contain them within his indestructible body. However, soon after, he starts to change, mentally showing signs of exacerbated stress and aggression, and gradually physically as well, resembling Doomsday more and more. It is revealed that Doomsday was released by the Phantom King (Xa-Du), on instigation of Brainiac; the latter orchestrated it to get rid of Superman as he prepared to assimilate the consciousnesses of all human beings in the world. Superman managed to take control of the raging power and fury of Doomsday for long enough, however, to attack and defeat Brainiac&#x27;s gigantic mother ship, dragging it into a black hole, ridding himself of the Doomsday infection in the process.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
In 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to &quot;The New 52&quot;. After the death of the New 52 Superman, the pre-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; Superman appears to confront Lex Luthor as he attempts to proclaim his new role as Metropolis&#x27;s protector in the absence of the Man of Steel, but their fight is interrupted when Doomsday emerges from a coffin that was being transported by an unidentified group in a hovercar above them. As Superman and Lex attempt to fight the creature, Superman is troubled to realize that this Doomsday operates at a strength level similar to the creature he faced for the first time in his world, but also has some degree of strategic planning, attacking passing trains and civilians to distract Superman and Luthor. As Wonder Woman appears to assist, Doomsday departs, but Superman and Wonder Woman are able to intercept him before he reaches Superman&#x27;s wife, Lois, and their son Jon. While Wonder Woman takes Lois and Jon to the JLA Watchtower for safety, Superman is confused when an unknown group appears and attacks Doomsday, but they are swiftly defeated. He subsequently manages to lure Doomsday to his own makeshift Fortress. Lois and Jon plea to Diana to help Clark when he struggles in containing him and she soon joins the battle again. This allows Clark time to use the Phantom Zone projector to trap his foe, but he is unaware that the unknown group led by Mr. Oz intercepted the Phantom Zone beam and have captured Doomsday for their own unknown purposes.

After the merging of the timelines of both pre and post-Flashpoint Superman in &quot;Superman Reborn&quot;, Doomsday had become smarter and escaped from his confinement when Tim Drake, who had also been imprisoned by Mr. Oz, opened all the cells to escape. Tim Drake from the &quot;Titans Tomorrow&quot; timeline, who had also been imprisoned there, came to his rescue and stunned Doomsday several times with rounds of Kryptonite ammunition. Unable to take him down, he tricked him into re-entering his cell by chasing a hologram of Superman.

==Powers and abilities==
Doomsday was developed in one of the harshest habitats in all of existence: prehistoric Krypton. Through cloning technology, the infant continually returned to life and evolved, becoming resistant or immune to whatever killed him before, ultimately permanently acquiring the capability to regenerate and evolve without technology. After the Radiant killed him the first time they fought, Doomsday grew immune to the Radiant&#x27;s energy-projection and even managed to withstand Darkseid&#x27;s full Omega-Effect. The amount of damage dealt to Doomsday determined the length of time it took for him to fully recover. During his outwardly undamaged death at Superman&#x27;s hands, he only needed some days to recover, but when Imperiex reduced him to a skeleton, it took months. His entombment in a Calatonian burial suit and metal vault lasted hundreds of millennia. After being killed by the Radiant and subsequently undergoing the impact of the casket on Earth, his body was sealed underground in total darkness, depriving him of solar energy and greatly slowing his resurrection.

Doomsday had a highly accelerated healing factor that allowed him to quickly regenerate from most damage. When his side was cut by Superman with a plasma sword, it closed within moments. As a result of his engineering, Doomsday did not need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep, and his body was almost solid mass with no internal organs, the masses of bone like material covering his body likely acting as some form of exoskeleton.

===Resistance===
Doomsday also was able to develop/evolve resistance from ordinary injuries. Superman once used a sound gun to greatly discomfort him, but Doomsday&#x27;s auditory canals closed up, making him impervious to Superman&#x27;s weapon. Waverider once paralyzed Doomsday with energy while seeking to perceive Doomsday&#x27;s presence, but the second attempt backfired as Doomsday triggered a feedback burst that briefly disrupted Waverider.

In essence, Doomsday gradually became more invulnerable if not injured beyond his ability to recover, which has so far been undefined. Doomsday developed weapons and abilities that countered the powers of an opponent. He managed to cancel out the pure-energy Radiant by slamming into him while generating a dark counter-energy; to greatly extend his claws and develop a poison to strike Superman in flight and reel him in; to breathe flames against the fire-sensitive Martian Manhunter, and apparently neutralize his defensive phase-shifting power. Doomsday&#x27;s skeleton protruded through his skin in razor-sharp spurs, which provided protection to his few vital organs (brain, eyes and nervous system), and acted as claw-like weapons on his hands, elbows, and knees. In addition, the tips of these protrusions are lethally poisonous even to powerful Apokoliptians like Darkseid.

Doomsday was immensely resistant to heat, cold, and conventional damage, allowing him to survive in the most inhospitable worlds, or in the vacuum of space. His superhuman endurance and invulnerability were able to withstand Darkseid&#x27;s full-powered &quot;Omega Effect&quot; without any apparent damage. This is an immunity he shares with Superman, being as he is technically Kryptonian.

Waverider&#x27;s words suggest that Doomsday&#x27;s body could have been completely destroyed after his battle with the Radiant, suggesting that his healing factor has its limits, but at this point Doomsday was left so damaged that he remained &#x27;comatose&#x27; for several thousand years while trapped and cut off from the solar energy he required to sustain himself. After his subsequent evolutions, it is unlikely that anything is capable of doing sufficient damage to him to bring him to this state again.

===Strength===
Doomsday possessed enormous superhuman strength that is significantly greater than Superman and at one point this enabled him to effortlessly stand his ground against the entire Justice League, including Superman and Orion. He was able to break Superman&#x27;s left arm with limited effort, as well as outmatch and beat Darkseid unconscious in combat. However, his strength has limits: the immensely strong Calatonian alloy cables, in which he was entombed, continued to partially restrain him during his initial rampage on Earth, with the last of the cables only being destroyed when the Justice League unleashed a full-power assault to try and stop him. It was never stated how long he had struggled to free his left hand before his escape.

Doomsday possessed seemingly inexhaustible stamina, and was not noticeably slowed down from fighting Superman for an entire day. His speed and agility were vastly disproportionate to his bulky stature, and he was able to match Superman in this regard, once even managing to grab the Flash while the hero was in motion. He could not fly, but traveled by leaping miles at a time. Superman took advantage of this in their first battle by trying to keep him airborne by flying into the sky.

After being regrown by Lex Luthor, Doomsday was genetically part-Kryptonian due to his genes having been spliced with Kal-El&#x27;s. However, with the exception of his flame-breath, he displayed no additional abilities. In fact, he was shown to be weaker than previously when he was single-handedly beaten by Superman. This was attributed to intelligence that he developed, causing him to fear the death that awaited him if he lost, but did not explain how a concussion could incapacitate his healing factor for the time he remained unconscious. He apparently lost his intelligence when he was sent back in time, reverting him to his original state of fearlessness.

Once he gained some of Superman&#x27;s Kryptonian DNA, he became susceptible to kryptonite. Unlike Superman, it caused him pain, but could not kill him. This rendered him controllable, but given his ability to adapt, this may not be permanent – it is unknown if he must first die and resurrect to gain immunity to something.

===Other powers===
During his confrontation with Steel, Doomsday spontaneously developed the power of flight, and the ability to cover his body with metallic armor, capable of resisting even Steel&#x27;s paralyzing nanites. In a later confrontation with the Outsiders, as he sought to confront the Eradicator, he demonstrated the ability to absorb energy from Looker and Halo&#x27;s attacks and send it back to them in a massive burst manipulating raw power like the Eradicator. During his battle with the Cyborg-Superman, the Cyborg tore through portions of Doomsday&#x27;s body, which were quickly replaced with bionic parts of his own, giving itself vast technopathy. When confronting Superboy, the monster showcased a blue glow in its eyes, indicating Tactile Telekinesis power even greater than his own, but it has since been revealed that these Doomsdays were actually clones of the original, each specifically designed to take out Steel, Henshaw, Eradicator and Superboy, putting them at a disadvantage when pitted against the other Supermen.

In the DCU revamp, Doomsday was revealed to grow and evolve in stages since its genesis. Growing as well as gaining in biomass and power over the course of its own development cycle, it was soon revealed that when it killed Superman post-reboot, it was only in its larval stage. While undergoing its adolescence phase, the monster created a giant clump of its own biomass as a makeshift cocoon, which steadily built up its physiological structure to its current state by feeding on the natural wildlife around it. Whence it hatched from its incubator, Doomsday became only that much greater an extinction level threat, now able to move to and from the Phantom Zone at will, using it as a hub for spontaneous teleportation. This was made possible due to its physical strength being vastly augmented to the point it could breach the dimensional barrier through physical force alone. He&#x27;d grown so powerful in such a short amount of time that the creature could overpower the demigoddess Diana of Themyscira in a straight forward battle with ease, going so far as to break both of her arms.

Additionally, Doomsday developed a death aura which sapped the life in a radius around him and could transform others into clones of him.

===Television===
====Live-action====
* Doomsday appears in the eighth season of &quot;Smallville&quot;, portrayed by Dario Delacio. This version was created on Krypton via its strongest creatures&#x27; DNA to serve as Major Zod and Faora&#x27;s &quot;son&quot; and kill Kal-El. Its genetic material became attached to the young Kal-El&#x27;s spaceship and traveled to Earth, where it befriended Lex Luthor and was given up for adoption in 1989. Receiving the name &quot;Davis Bloome&quot; (portrayed by Sam Witwer), he went on to become a paramedic and fall in love with Chloe Sullivan before recognizing Clark Kent as Kal-El, which causes him to periodically transform into Doomsday. Throughout the season, Bloome struggles to maintain control over Doomsday before Sullivan uses black kryptonite to separate them and Kent traps Doomsday underground. Following this, Bloome and Jimmy Olsen fight over their shared love of Sullivan before mortally wounding each other. Witwer was offered the chance to return in the ninth season, but ultimately declined as he felt it would be difficult for both the characters and audience to accept.
* Doomsday appears in &quot;Krypton&quot;. This version was originally Dax-Baron (portrayed by Staz Nair), a Kandorian with a unique genetic mutation who was convinced he would be the one to end a Kryptonian civil war and allowed Kryptonian scientists Wedna-El and Van-Zod to experiment on him until he became Doomsday. He was subsequently put into cryo-stasis, but is eventually freed in the present by Seg-El, who seeks his power to stop Brainiac despite Adam Strange&#x27;s protests. Zod eventually captures Doomsday to weaponize him in his campaign to colonize other planets before sending him to Krypton&#x27;s moon Wegthor to defeat a rebellion against him. After Wegthor is destroyed, Doomsday is presumed dead before being found in a frozen meteorite.
* Doomsday appears in &quot;Superman &amp; Lois&quot;, initially portrayed by Tyler Hoechlin and later motion-captured by Paul Lazenby. This version was originally Kal-El / Bizarro, a corrupted version of Superman from an inverted universe who was killed by Mitch Anderson before being resurrected by Bruno Mannheim, experimented on by Lex Luthor, which turns him into Doomsday. Throughout the third and fourth seasons, Doomsday serves as Lex&#x27;s enforcer until Lois Lane reminds the former of his time as Bizarro. Nonetheless, Luthor mutates Doomsday further, diminishing the latter&#x27;s mental capacity, before Steel incapacitates the monster and Superman flies him into the sun. Though Bizarro&#x27;s memories return, he allows Superman to kill him.

The Joker infects Superman with Scarecrow&#x27;s fear toxin, causing Superman to hallucinate a pregnant Lois Lane as Doomsday and fly her into outer space. When she died, a nuclear bomb that the Joker tied to her pulse detonated in Metropolis. Sometime later, Superman brings the real Doomsday under his control via a harness that limits his ability to act independently.

<text>The Bărăgan Plain ( ) is a steppe plain in south-eastern Romania. It makes up much of the eastern part of the Wallachian Plain. The region is known for its black soil and a rich humus, and is mostly a cereal-growing area.

It is bounded on the south and east by the Danube, and in the North by the Buzău and Călmățui rivers, both tributaries of the Danube. The western limit is a line joining the cities of Buzău, Urziceni, Budești, and Oltenița. The plain practically covers Ialomița and Călărași counties, extending into the southern portion of Buzău and Brăila counties.

The city of Bucharest is not part of Bărăgan but is on the Vlăsiei Plain.

==Major urban centers==

* Brăila – 180,302 (2011)
* Călărași – 65,181 (2011)
* Slobozia – 48,241 (2011)
* Fetești – 30,217 (2011)

The cities of Buzău, Urziceni, and Oltenița border the Plains, but are not considered part of the Plains proper.

==History==

Due to lack of forest in the past, the Bărăgan was an important route for the migratory peoples who roamed the area that is south-eastern Romania today. The Bărăgan Steppe was traditionally used as pasture by the shepherds in the Carpathian Mountains (including Transylvania) during transhumance, but was converted to arable land in the second half of the 19th century.

It was used as a depot for mass deportations by the Communist authorities during the 1950s. About 40,000 political prisoners, including Banat Swabians, were relocated here from the west of the country.

==Climate==
The Bărăgan Plain has a harsh climate with hot and dry summers and includes the location where the highest-ever temperature in Romania was recorded: , at Ion Sion, in August 1951. Winters are cold, and subject to the effects of a blizzard wind, known as &quot;crivăț&quot; (this feature also gives the plain its name, derived from the Cuman language for &quot;place where the blizzard is raging&quot;).

Due to its climate, it is one of the most inhospitable areas in Romania.

In his novel, &quot;Ciulinii Bărăganului&quot;, the Romanian writer Panait Istrati describes the Bărăgan Plain as follows: 

No trees grow here, and it&#x27;s so far from one water well to the next that you can die of thirst half-way. The inhabitant of Bărăgan constantly hopes that one day someone will come and teach him how to live better in the Bărăgan, in this dreadful wilderness where water is hidden in the deepest bowels of the earth and where nothing grows except thistles. They cover the land in less than a week. It&#x27;s the only thing the Bărăgan will tolerate, except for the sheep who lust after these thistles and devour them greedily. Come winter, the shepherd abandons this God forsaken land and returns home. Then the Bărăgan dons its white fur coat and lays to rest for six months. Nothing lives here any more. That&#x27;s the Bărăgan.

<doc id="537564" wikidata="Q745000" url="?curid=537564" title="Smiley Smile">
<text>Smiley Smile is the twelfth studio album by the American rock band the Beach Boys, released on September 18, 1967. Conceived as a simpler and more relaxed version of their unfinished &quot;Smile&quot; album, &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; is distinguished for its homespun arrangements, &quot;stoned&quot; aesthetic, and lo-fi production. Critics and fans generally received the album and its lead single, &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot;, with confusion and disappointment. The album reached number 9 on UK record charts, but sold poorly in the U.S., peaking at number 41—the band&#x27;s lowest chart placement to that point.

Following principal songwriter Brian Wilson&#x27;s declaration that most of the original &quot;Smile&quot; tapes would be abandoned, the majority of the recording sessions lasted for six weeks at his makeshift home studio using radio broadcasting equipment, a detuned piano, electronic bass, melodica, found objects for percussion, and a Baldwin theater organ. The unconventional recording process juxtaposed an experimental party-like atmosphere with short pieces of music edited together in a disjointed manner, combining the engineering methods of &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; (1966) with the loose feeling of &quot;Beach Boys&#x27; Party!&quot; (1965). Despite leading these sessions, Wilson deliberately credited the album&#x27;s production to the group collectively for the first time.

From late 1966 to mid-1967, &quot;Smile&quot; had been repeatedly delayed while the Beach Boys were subject to a considerable level of media hype proclaiming Wilson to be a &quot;genius&quot;. After settling payment disputes with Capitol Records, &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; was distributed in collaboration with Brother Records, the band&#x27;s new self-owned record company. A second single, &quot;Gettin&#x27; Hungry&quot;, was credited to Wilson and Mike Love and failed to chart. &quot;Smile&quot; was left incomplete as the band immediately moved onto the recording of &quot;Lei&#x27;d in Hawaii&quot;, an unfinished live album featuring performances in the style of &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, and &quot;Wild Honey&quot;, released in December 1967. 

&quot;Smiley Smile&quot; has since become a critical and cult favorite, influencing the development of the lo-fi, ambient, and bedroom pop genres. It is often regarded as one of the finest chill-out albums for having positive effects on listeners experiencing an LSD comedown, a usage adopted by at least one drug clinic. In 1974, it was ranked number 64 in &quot;NME&quot;″s list of the greatest albums of all time. Outtakes and session highlights from the album were included on the compilations &quot;The Smile Sessions&quot; (2011) and &quot;1967 – Sunshine Tomorrow&quot; (2017).

==Background==
===Original &quot;Smile&quot; sessions (1966–1967)===

The Beach Boys&#x27; album &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, issued on May 16, 1966, was massively influential upon its release, containing lush and sophisticated orchestral arrangements that raised the band&#x27;s prestige to the top level of rock innovators. Early reviews for the album in the US ranged from negative to tentatively positive, but the reception from music journalists in the UK was very favorable. The group had recently employed the Beatles&#x27; former press officer Derek Taylor as their publicist. Bothered by the popular view of the Beach Boys as outdated surfers, leader and songwriter Brian Wilson requested that Taylor establish a new image for the band as fashionable counterculture icons, resulting in Taylor spearheading a media campaign with the tagline &quot;Brian Wilson is a genius&quot;.

In October 1966, the group followed up &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; with &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, a laboriously produced single that achieved major international success. By then, an album titled &quot;Smile&quot; had been conceived as an extension of that song&#x27;s recording approach, with Wilson composing music in collaboration with lyricist Van Dyke Parks. Wilson envisioned &quot;Smile&quot; as an outlet for all of his intellectual occupations, such as his fascination with spirituality and its relationship to humor and laughter. He told &quot;Melody Maker&quot;: &quot;Our new album will be better than &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. It will be as much an improvement over &quot;Sounds&quot; as that was over [our 1965 album] &quot;Summer Days&quot;.&quot; By the end of the year, &quot;NME&quot; conducted an annual reader&#x27;s poll that placed the Beach Boys as the world&#x27;s top vocal group, ahead of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.

===Litigation and collapse (February–June 1967)===


Business partner David Anderle attempted to form Brother Records, an independent label, with the intention of giving &quot;entirely new concepts to the recording industry, and to give the Beach Boys total creative and promotional control over their product.&quot; A February 1967 lawsuit seeking $255,000 (equivalent to $ in ) was launched against Capitol Records over neglected royalty payments. Within the lawsuit, there was also an attempt to terminate the band&#x27;s contract with Capitol before its November 1969 expiration. In April 1967, Wilson and his wife put their Beverly Hills home up for sale and took residence at a newly purchased mansion in Bel Air. Wilson also set to work on constructing a personal home studio.

Parks permanently withdrew from the project in April, with Anderle following suit weeks later. Between mid-April and early May, Wilson took a four-week break from studio recording. On April 26, Carl Wilson was arrested for refusing his draft into the US Army and later released on bail. On April 28, in an effort to promote the group&#x27;s upcoming UK tour, EMI issued the single &quot;Then I Kissed Her&quot; to the chagrin of the band, who did not approve the release. On May 6, a week after stating that &quot;Smile&quot; was to be released &quot;any moment&quot;, Taylor announced in &quot;Disc &amp; Music Echo&quot; that the album had been &quot;scrapped&quot; by Wilson. However, Taylor&#x27;s assertion of the album&#x27;s cancellation at that point was likely to be spurious. The Beach Boys were still under pressure and a contractual obligation to deliver an album to Capitol. For most of May, the touring group embarked on a run of shows in Europe while Brian resumed scheduling recording sessions at professional studios, some of which were cancelled on short notice.

Throughout 1967, Wilson&#x27;s public image was reduced to that of an &quot;eccentric&quot; figure as a multitude of revolutionary rock albums were released to an anxious and maturing youth market. For a time, the Beach Boys had been the Beatles&#x27; chief rivals, and Wilson was concerned that if &quot;Smile&quot; followed in the wake of another critically successful release by the Beatles, then his album would be received with unjust comparisons. His race was effectively lost when the Beatles released &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (May 1967). By June, Wilson declared to his bandmates that most of the material recorded for &quot;Smile&quot; would be abandoned. In an interview conducted in January 1968, he intimated that he had run out of ideas &quot;in a conventional sense&quot; and had been &quot;about ready to die&quot; before &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;. He said: &quot;I decided not to try any more, and not try and do such great things.&quot;

==Style and content==
===Modular approach and recording atmosphere===
Since the recording of &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; in 1966, Wilson had established a new method of operation. Instead of working on whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, Wilson limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or &quot;modules&quot;). Through the method of tape splicing, each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence, allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time. &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; continued this approach. The album also continued Brian&#x27;s exploration of &quot;party tracks&quot;—a form of music which includes the sounds of people shouting and making noises, as if at a party. Brian had enacted this approach with &quot;Beach Boys&#x27; Party!&quot; in 1965, thereby mixing that record&#x27;s style with the modular composition method he devised for &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;.

Most of &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; was recorded at Brian&#x27;s improvised home studio from June 3 to July 14, 1967. The group had held a few of the early sessions at Hollywood Sound Recorders and Western Studios. All sessions after June 11 were conducted at the home studio. The core instrumentation at these sessions consisted of organ, honky-tonk piano, and electronic bass played by the Beach Boys themselves, rather than the session musicians employed in much of their previous work. Brian became obsessed with a three-tiered Baldwin organ during the album&#x27;s recording, resulting in a more minimalist approach to the new arrangements. Most of the piano was played by Brian, and most of the bass was played by Carl.

It was the first album for which production was credited to the entire group, instead of Brian alone. Dennis Wilson explained: &quot;He wanted it that way. He said &#x27;It&#x27;s produced by the Beach Boys. When asked if Brian was &quot;still the producer of &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;&quot;, Carl answered, &quot;Most definitely.&quot; He described &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; as an improvised, low-effort affair that was &quot;more like a &#x27;jam&#x27; album.&quot; Brian acknowledged: &quot;We had done about six months work on another thing, but we jumped and ended up doing the entire thing here at the house with an entirely different mood and approach than what we originally started out with.&quot; When questioned on why the band took the approach they did, he stated, &quot;We just had a particular atmosphere that we were working in that inspired the particular kind of things that were on the album.&quot; He said that he did not &quot;have any paranoia feelings&quot; recording the album: &quot;[W]e had so much fun. The &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; era was so great, it was unbelievable. Personally, spiritually, everything, it was great.&quot;

According to music theorist Daniel Harrison, &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; is not a work of rock music as the term was understood in 1967, and that portions of the album &quot;can be thought of as a kind of protominimal rock music&quot;. In his book about psychedelic music, author Jim DeRogatis referred to &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; as a work of the &quot;ultimate psychedelic rock library&quot;. Conversely, &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;″s Edwin Faust wrote in 2003 that the album &quot;embraces the listener with a drugged out sincerity; a feat never accomplished by the more pretentious and heavy-handed psychedelia of that era. It is for this reason &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; flows so well with the more experimental pop of today&quot;.

Music journalist Domenic Priore notes that when the Beach Boys were taken out of professional studios, &quot;the discipline of the clock, rates and overtime disappeared&quot;. Mike Love, recalling how &quot;She&#x27;s Goin&#x27; Bald&quot; had been written about fellatio, commented: &quot;We were stoned out of our heads. We were laughing our asses off when we recorded that stuff.&quot; Dennis remembered the album as &quot;the most fun thing we ever did.&quot; Bruce Johnston did not participate in most of these sessions. He later called the work &quot;very spacy&quot; and &quot;weird&quot;, but &quot;so subtle and so damn innovative.&quot;

===Differences from &quot;Smile&quot;===
Carl Wilson famously compared &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; to &quot;a bunt instead of a grand slam&quot;. From the vast sum of material Brian had recorded for &quot;Smile&quot;, only portions of the backing track for &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; (recorded October 1966) and the coda for &quot;Vegetables&quot; (recorded April 1967) were used for &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;. Comparing Brian&#x27;s original &quot;Smile&quot; mixes with the &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; version of &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot;, Al Jardine called it &quot;a pale facsimile ... Brian re-invented the song for this record ... He purposefully under-produced the song.&quot; &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, which was recorded sporadically from February to September 1966, appears with no differences from the original single. Brian reportedly objected to the placement of &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; on &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, but for the first time, he was outvoted by his bandmates, who insisted on its inclusion.

&quot;Wind Chimes&quot;, &quot;Wonderful&quot;, and most parts of &quot;Vegetables&quot; were completely rerecorded with scaled-down arrangements. &quot;Vegetables&quot; was reworked as a kind of campfire song, while &quot;Wonderful&quot; traded its harpsichord and trumpet for a haphazardly-played organ, high-pitched backing vocals, and a doo-wop sing-along section. The marimbas in &quot;Wind Chimes&quot; were replaced by organ and dissonant noise. Other tracks only extracted minor elements, such as a melody line, from other &quot;Smile&quot; pieces. &quot;She&#x27;s Goin&#x27; Bald&quot; borrows the verse melody from a &quot;Smile&quot; fragment known as &quot;He Gives Speeches&quot;, &quot;With Me Tonight&quot; is a variation on &quot;Vegetables&quot;, and &quot;Fall Breaks and Back to Winter (W. Woodpecker Symphony)&quot; lifts a recurring melodic hook from &quot;Fire&quot;. 
Despite reports that &quot;Smile&quot; had been shelved for being &quot;too weird&quot;, there was no attempt by the band to make the musical content on &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; appear any less bizarre for their traditional fanbase. David Anderle thought that Brian&#x27;s intention was &quot;to salvage as much of &quot;Smile&quot; as he could and at the same time immediately go into his [long-discussed] humor album.&quot; According to a contemporary &quot;Hullabaloo&quot; article, &quot;The title, suggested by [Wilson&#x27;s cousin] Barry Turnbull, reflects the album&#x27;s happy concept, it is taken from the Indian aphorism, &#x27;The smile that you send out returns to you.&#x27;&quot; The cover artwork featured a new illustration of Frank Holmes&#x27; Smile Shoppe, this time located in the middle of an overgrown jungle.

&quot;Smiley Smile&quot; was produced without any direct involvement from Van Dyke Parks. The only songs that appeared to have no connection to the original &quot;Smile&quot; album were &quot;Little Pad&quot; and &quot;Gettin&#x27; Hungry&quot;. In addition, while the Beatles&#x27; Paul McCartney was present at an April 1967 session for &quot;Vegetables&quot;, the recording where he had reportedly supplied celery crunching sounds was not used on &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;.

===Technical aspects and mixdown===
&quot;Smiley Smile&quot; was recorded with an eight-track tape machine, with all the different musical sections spread out across numerous reels of tape. In other words, intros, verses, choruses, and endings were each allocated their own reel. The Beach Boys recorded using what was predominantly radio broadcasting equipment, which lacked many of the technical elements and effects found in an established studio. The studio set up at Brian&#x27;s house was, in its mid-1967 incarnation for &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, in its infancy. Due to the sporadic nature at which Brian decided to produce the record at his home, there was little time to fully outfit the Bel Air residence as a properly-equipped recording studio.

Tracks were typically constructed around a performance of Wilson playing piano that was usually mixed out of the final recording. This process was equivalent to the use of click tracks a decade before they were common. Some recording accidents were used to their advantage, such as in &quot;With Me Tonight&quot;, which contains an informal link between the verse and chorus by way of a voice saying &quot;good&quot;, as in &quot;good take&quot;, spoken by the band&#x27;s friend Arny Geller from the control room. Tape manipulation was another prominent feature, with varispeed being applied to a few vocals. On &quot;She&#x27;s Goin&#x27; Bald&quot;, a new device called the Eltro Information Rate Changer was used to raise the pitch of the group&#x27;s vocals without affecting the tempo.

The home set-up was moved between different areas as the sessions progressed. This led to unconventional ways of achieving particular sounds at the home, such as a replacement for what would be achieved by an echo chamber. The album&#x27;s engineer Jim Lockert recalled how &quot;Brian&#x27;s swimming pool had a leak in it and was empty, so we put a microphone in the bottom of this damn near Olympic-size pool and the guys laid down inside the pool and sang so the sound would go down the wall of the concrete pool into the microphone – and that was part of the vocals on one of those songs.&quot; Some vocals were also tracked in the shower.

Lockert detailed a unique and labor-intensive process for the final mixing session of the album that began at five o&#x27;clock one evening and concluded the following morning at Wally Heider&#x27;s Studio 3 in Hollywood. The mixing strategy involved sequentially mixing the introduction and first verse of each song directly to a two-track tape. Rather than creating copies for assembly, the team would then erase the vocals from the mixed segment, record the harmony and lead parts for the subsequent verse, and mix it down to the same tape. This meticulous approach was repeated for each section of the song, ensuring that by the end of the session, the album was fully mixed and edited. Lockert recalled, &quot;One of the guys from Wally Heider was my second engineer and he said, &#x27;Well, I never believed in miracles but I saw one tonight.&#x27; That’s the way they did it. It wasn&#x27;t my idea. They mixed it chorus and verse, chorus and verse and intro, and all the levels had to match.&quot;

==Release==

The Beach Boys were initially involved in the conception of the Monterey Pop Festival, which was held in June 1967. At the last minute, the band announced that they could not appear at the festival for reasons pertaining to Carl&#x27;s military draft and their commitments to finish &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; for Capitol. Derek Taylor, who had terminated his employment with the group to focus on the festival&#x27;s organization, remembered that dropping out of the program &quot;undoubtedly set the band in a very bad light. They were certainly heavily criticized at the time for it. It seemed rather like an admission of defeat.&quot; Biographer David Leaf explained: &quot;Monterey was a gathering place for the &#x27;far out&#x27; sounds of the &#x27;new&#x27; rock ... and it is thought that this non-appearance was what really turned the &#x27;underground&#x27; tide against them.&quot; Detractors referred to the band as the &quot;Bleach Boys&quot; and &quot;the California Hypes&quot; as the media focus shifted from Los Angeles to the happenings in San Francisco.

The Capitol lawsuit was eventually settled out of court, with the Beach Boys receiving the royalties owed in exchange for Brother Records to distribute through Capitol Records, along with a guarantee that the band produce at least one million dollars profit. An official announcement of the resolution was made on July 18. Capitol A&amp;R director Karl Engemann began circulating a memo, dated July 25, in which &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; was referred to as a stopgap for &quot;Smile&quot;. The memo also discussed conversations between him and Wilson pertaining to the release of a 10-track &quot;Smile&quot; album, which would not have included the songs &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; or &quot;Vegetables&quot;. In July, two singles were issued on the Brother imprint: &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; and &quot;Gettin&#x27; Hungry&quot;. The former peaked at number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The latter was not credited to the Beach Boys, but instead to Brian Wilson and Mike Love.

&quot;Smile&quot; was never delivered; instead, the group played two shows at an auditorium in Honolulu, which were filmed and recorded with the intention of releasing a live album, &quot;Lei&#x27;d in Hawaii&quot;. On stage, the band performed &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; and &quot;Gettin&#x27; Hungry&quot;, and rearranged their past hits in the style of &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;. Priore writes that the engagement was effectively the band&#x27;s &quot;attempt to make up&quot; for cancelling their gig at Monterey. Bruce Johnston, who was absent for most of the &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; recording sessions, did not accompany the group, although Brian did. In early August, Johnston told the British press that he had heard &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, and when asked about &quot;Smile&quot;, said that the album would be released &quot;within the next two months.&quot;

On September 18, 1967, &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; was released in the US. The LP peaked at number 41 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, making it their worst-selling album to that date. It spent most of its 21-week chart time bubbling under 100 and 197. When released in the UK in November, it performed better, reaching number 9 of the UK Albums Chart. During their annual Thanksgiving tour of the US, the band did not perform any of the tracks on &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; except &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;. In a December interview, Mike Love acknowledged that &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; had &quot;baffled and mystified&quot; the public and that the band &quot;had this feeling that we were going too far, losing touch I guess.&quot; He promised that their next album, then slated to be &quot;Wild Honey&quot;, would bring the group &quot;back more into reality&quot;.

==Initial reviews==

In the description of journalist Nick Kent, &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; &quot;appeared like the single most underwhelming musical statement of the sixties&quot;. It was a &quot;major disappointment&quot; for fans, many of whom had expected a work similar to &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. According to writer Scott Schinder, the LP was released to &quot;general incomprehension. While &quot;Smile&quot; may have divided the Beach Boys&#x27; fans had it been released, &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; merely baffled them.&quot; Anderle said that whatever new fans the group had brought with &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; were &quot;immediately lost with the release of &#x27;Heroes of Villains,&#x27; then with the album [&quot;Smiley Smile&quot;].&quot; Biographer Keith Badman writes that the music press responded by &quot;effectively blacklisting the band, refusing to review their latest records, or reviewing them long after they have been released.&quot;

&quot;Undoubtedly the worst album ever released by The Beach Boys&quot;, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; wrote. &quot;Prestige has been &quot;seriously&quot; damaged.&quot; A review in &quot;Hit Parader&quot; praised the album for &quot;probably [having] more a cappella harmony than on any album since the fall of the singing-group era in the late 1950s&quot;, but reserved that they &quot;still like &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; better&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; wrote, &quot;By the standards which this group has set itself, it&#x27;s more than a grade disappointing.&quot; &quot;Hi Fidelity&quot; said: &quot;... they are making the psychedelic route ... perhaps in the unforgettable city of Fresno. Until they reach the San Francisco Bay Bridge or return to the shores of Malibu ... their work can only receive partial approval.&quot;

More favorably, &quot;Record Mirror&quot;″s Wesley Laine predicted that &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; would &quot;probably go to the top of the LP charts&quot;. He felt that it contained better songs &quot;on the whole&quot; than &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, as well as &quot;extremely clever and insiduous ... production and arrangements [that] fall into the current psychedelic bag without being blatantly acidy.&quot; The &quot;Milwaukee Sentinel&quot; praised the LP as &quot;probably the most valuable contribution to rock since the Beatles &quot;Revolver&quot;&quot; and for being unlike anything the Beatles had done. &quot;Cheetah&quot; gave the album a rave review, observing that &quot;the mood is rather childlike (not childish)—the kind of innocence that shows on the album cover, with its Rousseau-like animals and forest, and the smoke from the cabin chimney spelling out the title. ... The expression that emerges from this music is very strange: it&#x27;s a very personal mood.&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; journalist Richard Goldstein rued that &quot;the album is a memorable, if disjointed experience, and a truly religious one as well. One must decide for oneself what the sermon is worth listening for.&quot; In his May 1968 column in &quot;Esquire&quot;, Robert Christgau praised the minimalism of &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, characterizing the record as &quot;slight&quot; and calling the deliberately uncommercial sound of the album &quot;unique and almost perfect&quot;.

Controversy involving whether the band was to be taken as a serious rock group followed them into the next year. On December 14, 1967, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editor and co-founder Jann Wenner printed an influential article that denounced Wilson&#x27;s &quot;genius&quot; label, which he called a &quot;promotional shuck&quot;, and the Beach Boys themselves, which he called &quot;one prominent example of a group that has gotten hung up on trying to catch The Beatles&quot;. He wrote that &quot;for some reason, [&quot;Smiley Smile&quot;] just doesn&#x27;t make it ... [the songs] just don&#x27;t move you. Other than displaying Brian Wilson&#x27;s virtuosity for production, they are pointless.&quot; In February 1968, a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer referred to the album as a &quot;disaster&quot; and an &quot;abortive attempt to match the talents of Lennon and McCartney.&quot;

==Aftermath and archival releases==
&quot;Smiley Smile&quot; became the first in a three-part series of lo-fi Beach Boys albums (preceding &quot;Wild Honey&quot; and &quot;Friends&quot;) and the first in a seven-year string of under-performing Beach Boys albums (ending with the 1974 compilation &quot;Endless Summer&quot;). The &quot;Smile&quot; era is generally viewed as the ending of the Beach Boys&#x27; most artistically creative period, and the point after which Brian began gradually relinquishing his hold as the group&#x27;s creative leader.

Commenting on &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; in retrospect, Bruce Johnston said it was &quot;a thousand times better than the [original &quot;Smile&quot;] ... It&#x27;s just the most underrated album in the whole catalog for me.&quot; Dennis Wilson said, &quot;It was not as ambitious as &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; was. But ... I listened to it in a jungle in Africa and it sounded great.&quot; Conversely, Al Jardine felt that &quot;there are some pretty cool songs on that album but I didn&#x27;t like rehashing some of the &quot;Smile&quot; songs. That didn&#x27;t work for me.&quot; Mike Love wrote, &quot;Some of the songs we recorded could barely be called songs. They were chants, spacey fragments, weird sound effects. Every group produces at least one bad album ... I don&#x27;t think Brian wanted to be associated with it either.&quot;

Much of the group&#x27;s subsequent recordings from 1967 to 1970 followed similar experimental traditions as &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; – namely, through sparse instrumentation, a more relaxed ensemble, and a seeming inattention to production quality. Numerous session musicians have reported that the Beach Boys had not been a distraction to Brian&#x27;s workflow when recording at established studios, but once the group made the home studio their primary base of operations, his bandmates became more integrated in the band&#x27;s creative decisions. Carl took Brian&#x27;s place as the most musically dominant member, and Brian would not be credited as producer for another Beach Boys album until 1976&#x27;s &quot;15 Big Ones&quot;. 

&quot;Smile&quot; material continued to trickle out in later releases, often as filler songs to offset Brian&#x27;s unwillingness to contribute. &quot;Cool, Cool Water&quot;, an outtake from &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; and &quot;Wild Honey&quot; sessions, was partially rerecorded and issued as the closing track for &quot;Sunflower&quot; (1970). When &quot;The Smile Sessions&quot; box set was released in 2011, co-producer Mark Linett acknowledged that &quot;there&#x27;s things that some people think – should &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; sessions be there – [with tracks such as] &#x27;Can&#x27;t Wait Too Long&#x27;, we get into a very fuzzy area&quot;. In 2017, additional session highlights from the album were released on the rarities compilation &quot;1967 – Sunshine Tomorrow&quot;. The compilation was followed several months later with two more digital-exclusive releases: &quot;1967 – Sunshine Tomorrow 2: The Studio Sessions&quot; and &quot;1967 – Live Sunshine&quot;.

==Reappraisal==
&quot;Smiley Smile&quot; has since become a cult and critical favorite in the Beach Boys&#x27; catalog. In biographer Peter Ames Carlin&#x27;s estimation, &quot;the album&#x27;s reputation improved with hindsight&quot;, particularly after the release of &quot;stripped-down warts-and-all albums&quot; by other artists, including Bob Dylan (&quot;John Wesley Harding&quot;, 1967) and the Beatles (The White Album, 1968). Writing in 1971, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s Richard Williams referred to &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; as &quot;The Great Undiscovered Pop Album&quot;, one that had been &quot;either ignored or dismissed by the reviewers.&quot; The album&#x27;s prevailing negative response mellowed after the record was reissued in 1974 – the same year that the staff of &quot;NME&quot; ranked it as the 62nd greatest album of all time.

Since the mid-1970s, the album has developed a following that appreciates the distinct qualities of its low-fidelity production, positioning it as an essential entry in Wilson&#x27;s oeuvre. It is considered a masterwork among fans of lo-fi art. Reviewing the album for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger called it a &quot;rather nifty, if rather slight, effort that&#x27;s plenty weird&quot;. Spencer Owen of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; deemed it &quot;a near-masterpiece. Without any awareness of &quot;Smile&quot;&#x27;s existence, this album could have been a contemporary classic ... and although the album isn&#x27;t anywhere close to the sonic revolution that &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; had already brought, Wilson&#x27;s innovative production and arrangements still bring out the best in every single track.&quot; &quot;Blender&quot;″s Douglas Wolk called it &quot;the Boys&#x27; psychedelic album — joltingly spare, druggy and funny, with the most gorgeous harmonies of their career.&quot;

Less favorably, Kent maintained that the album &quot;undersold the worth&quot; of &quot;Smile&quot; with &quot;dumb pot-head skits, so-called healing chants and even some weird &#x27;loony tunes&#x27; items straight out of a cut-rate Walt Disney soundtrack&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Geoffrey Cannon viewed Parks&#x27; lyrics as &quot;pretentious&quot;, believing that Parks &quot;messed Brian up&quot; during &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;. &quot;Paste&quot;″s Bryan Rolli ranked it at number 2 in a list of the &quot;10 Most Disappointing Follow-Up Albums&quot;, calling it a &quot;disjointed collection of minimalist recordings and a capella bits that are not so much songs as fragments of a shattered psyche&quot;. In the 2004 edition of &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, the reviewer described &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; as &quot;inconsistent&quot; and said that, given the context of its release in September 1967, &quot;the album was like a strange throwback – it highlighted how out of touch these suburban California surfers had become with the psychedelic times.&quot; In his 2007 book &quot;The Act You&#x27;ve Known for All These Years: The Life, and Afterlife, of Sgt. Pepper&quot;, Clinton Heylin writes that the album &quot;sounded like a [throwaway] contractual obligation&quot; and, together with its commercial failure, confirmed &quot;one of the most spectacular falls from grace of any sixties band&quot;.

In the 2000s, &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; began to be included in lists of &quot;must-hear&quot; albums compiled by various publications. In 2000, it was ranked number 415 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s book of the &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In a 2007 issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Robert Christgau and David Fricke named it one of the 40 essential albums of 1967; Christgau declared: &quot;Towering it&#x27;s not; some kind of hit it is.&quot; In 2017, it was ranked number 118 on &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s list of greatest albums of the 1960s, where it was described as having &quot;developed a small cult of its own, attracting those drawn to its stripped-down, highly spontaneous, and deeply stoned vibe.&quot;

==Impact and legacy==
In later years, &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; became celebrated as one of the finest chill-out albums, and one that is suited for listening during an LSD comedown. At least one drug treatment center adopted the LP as a tool for comforting patients. Carl Wilson mentioned this clinic, located in Fort Worth, Texas, to the NME in 1970, saying, &quot;They don&#x27;t use any traditional medical treatment whatsoever. All they do is play the patient our &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; album and apparently this acts as a soothing remedy which relaxes them and helps them to recover completely from their trip.&quot;
Music theorist Daniel Harrison writes that &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; may be regarded as a piece akin to art music within the Western classical tradition, highlighting its pioneering contributions to the rock genre as comparable to the introduction of unconventional techniques, such as atonality, in classical music. Writing in 1971, Richard Williams felt that the album&#x27;s disjointed and fragmentary approach had &quot;all the epigrammatic, enigmatic power of Japanese &quot;haiku&quot;&quot;, containing &#x27;passages written in the conditional tense (i.e. the songs move easily between reality and fantasy), a technique evolved by Godard in the cinema and which only Wilson, as far as I know, has picked up in pop.&quot;

&quot;Smiley Smile&quot; was one of 100 albums featured in the 2000 book &quot;The Ambient Century&quot; as a chapter in the development of ambient music. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; contributor Mark Richardson wrote that the record &quot;basically invented the kind of lo-fi bedroom pop that would later propel Sebadoh, Animal Collective, and other characters.&quot; The &quot;New York Observer&quot;″s Ron Hart wrote that &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; had effectively presaged the work of Harry Nilsson, Elvis Costello, Stereolab, the High Llamas, the Olivia Tremor Control, and Father John Misty. Dedicated tribute albums include &quot;Smiling Pets&quot; (1998) and &quot;Portland Sings The Beach Boys &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;&quot; (2013).

Other admirers of the album have included Pete Townshend of the Who and Robbie Robertson of the Band. XTC&#x27;s Andy Partridge considered it one of &quot;the most influential records for me&quot; and it was a direct inspiration for his song &quot;Season Cycle&quot; (&quot;Skylarking&quot;, 1986). In an interview with &quot;Time&quot;, Steven Tyler of Aerosmith stated that his &quot;island&quot; music picks include &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, &quot;Just for the melodic fuck all.&quot; Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka, composers for the Japanese role-playing video game series &quot;Mother&quot;, cited &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; among influences on the games&#x27; soundtracks. Comedian Trevor Moore stated that the theme song for his troupe&#x27;s television show, &quot;The Whitest Kids U&#x27; Know&quot;, was based on &quot;Little Pad&quot;, which itself had been used as the opening theme for their live shows.

<text>The Sino-Vietnamese War (also known by other names) was a brief conflict that occurred in early 1979 between China and Vietnam. China launched an offensive ostensibly in response to Vietnam&#x27;s invasion and occupation of Cambodia in 1978, which ended the rule of the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge. The conflict lasted for about a month, with China withdrawing its troops in March 1979.

In February 1979, Chinese forces launched a surprise invasion of northern Vietnam and quickly captured several cities near the border. On 6March of that year, China declared that its punitive mission had been accomplished. Chinese troops then withdrew from Vietnam. Vietnam continued to occupy Cambodia until 1989, suggesting that China failed to achieve one of its stated aims of dissuading Vietnam from involvement in Cambodia. China&#x27;s operation at least forced Vietnam to withdraw the 2nd Corps, from the invasion forces of Cambodia to reinforce the defense of Hanoi. Additionally, it demonstrated that the Soviet Union, its Cold War communist adversary, was unable to protect its Vietnamese ally. The conflict had a lasting impact on the relationship between China and Vietnam, and diplomatic relations between the two countries were not fully restored until 1991, following the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The Sino-Vietnamese land border was formally agreed upon in 1999.

==Names==
The Sino-Vietnamese War is known by various names in Chinese and Vietnamese. The neutral names for the war are (Sino-Vietnamese war) in Chinese and (Vietnamese-Chinese border war) in Vietnamese. The Chinese government refers to the war as the &quot;China-Vietnam border self-defense counterattack operations&quot; () or the &quot;Self-defensive counterattack operations against Vietnam to protect the border&quot; (). Chinese non-official sources generally use a shorter form, &quot;Self-defensive counterattack against Vietnam&quot; (). The Vietnamese government calls it the &quot;War against Chinese expansionism&quot; (), while a party-aligned newspaper calls it the &quot;Northern Border Defense War&quot;.

The Sino-Vietnamese War is also known as the Third Indochina War in Western historiography.

==Background==
Just as the First Indochina War—which emerged from the complex situation following World War II—and the Vietnam War arose from the indecisive aftermath of political relations, the Third Indochina War again followed the unresolved problems of the earlier wars.

The victors of World War II, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, all agreed that the area belonged to the French. As the French did not have the means to immediately retake Indochina, the major powers agreed that the British would take control and troops would occupy the south while Nationalist Chinese forces would move in from the north. Nationalist Chinese troops entered the country to disarm Japanese troops north of the 16th parallel on 14 September 1945. The parallel divided Indochina into Chinese and British controlled zones (see Timeline of World War II (1945)). The British landed in the south and rearmed the small body of interned French forces as well as parts of the surrendered Japanese forces to aid in retaking southern Vietnam, as there were not enough British troops available.

On the urging of the Soviet Union, Ho Chi Minh initially attempted to negotiate with the French, who were slowly reestablishing their control across the area, although still under British control until hostilities had ceased. Once hostilities had ended, the British handed over the territory to the French. In January 1946, the Viet Minh won elections across central and northern Vietnam. On 6 March 1946, Ho signed an agreement allowing French forces to replace Nationalist Chinese forces, in exchange for French recognition of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as a &quot;free&quot; republic within the French Union, with the specifics of such recognition to be negotiated later. British forces departed on 26 March 1946, leaving Vietnam in the control of the French. The French landed in Hanoi by March 1946 and in November of that year they ousted the Viet Minh from the city. The Viet Minh resumed guerrilla warfare against the French Union forces, beginning the first Indochina War.

===French colonialism and the First Indochina War===
Vietnam first became a French colony when France invaded in 1858. By the 1880s, the French had expanded their sphere of influence in Southeast Asia to include all of Vietnam, and by 1893 both Laos and Cambodia had become French colonies as well. Rebellions against French colonial power were common up to World War I. The European war heightened revolutionary sentiment in Southeast Asia, and the independence-minded population rallied around revolutionaries such as Hồ Chí Minh and others, including royalists.

Prior to their attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese occupied French Indochina, but left civil administration to the Vichy French administration. On 9 March 1945, fearing that the Vichy French were about to switch sides to support the Allies, the Japanese overthrew the Vichy administration and forces taking control of Indochina and establishing their own puppet administration, the Empire of Vietnam. The Japanese surrender in August 1945 created a power vacuum in Indochina, as the various political factions scrambled for control.

The events leading to the First Indochina War are subject to historical dispute. When the Việt Minh hastily sought to establish the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the remaining French acquiesced while waiting for the return of French forces to the region. The Kuomintang supported French restoration, but Viet Minh efforts towards independence were helped by Chinese communists under the Soviet Union&#x27;s influence. The Soviet Union at first indirectly supported Vietnamese communists, but later directly supported Hồ Chí Minh. The Soviets nonetheless remained less supportive than China until after the Sino-Soviet split, during the time of Leonid Brezhnev when the Soviet Union became communist Vietnam&#x27;s key ally.

The war itself involved numerous events that had major impacts throughout Indochina. Two major conferences were held to bring about a resolution. Finally, on 20 July 1954, the Geneva Conference resulted in a political settlement to reunite the country, signed with support from China, the Soviet Union, and Western European powers. While the Soviet Union played a constructive role in the agreement, it again was not as involved as China. The U.S. did not sign the agreement and swiftly moved to back South Vietnam.

===Sino-Soviet split===
The Chinese Communist Party and the Viet Minh had a long history. During the initial stages of the First Indochina War with France, the recently founded communist People&#x27;s Republic of China continued the Soviet mission to expand communism. Therefore, they aided the Viet Minh and became the connector between Soviets and the Viet Minh.

After the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953, relations between the Soviet Union and China began to deteriorate. Mao Zedong believed the new Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev had made a serious error in his Secret Speech denouncing Stalin in February 1956, and criticized the Soviet Union&#x27;s interpretation of Marxism–Leninism, in particular Khrushchev&#x27;s support for peaceful co-existence and its interpretation. This led to increasingly hostile relations, and eventually the Sino-Soviet split. From here, Chinese communists played a decreasing role in helping their former allies because the Viet Minh did not support China against the Soviets.

Following worsening relations between the Soviet Union and China as a result of the Sino-Soviet split of 1956–1966, as many as 1.5 million Chinese troops were stationed along the Sino-Soviet border in preparation for a full-scale war against the Soviets.

Vietnam joined the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) on June 28, 1978. Soviet military aid to Vietnam increased from $75-$125 million in 1977 to $600-$800 million in 1978. On November 3, 1978, Vietnam and the Soviet Union signed a formal military alliance. The Soviet Union supported Vietnam&#x27;s invasion of Cambodia, launched in December 1978.

Following the death of Mao in September 1976, the overthrow of the Gang of Four and the ascent of Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leadership revised its own positions to become compatible with market aspects, denounced the Cultural Revolution, and collaborated with the US against the Soviet Union.

===Vietnam War===

As France withdrew from a provisionally divided Vietnam in late 1954, the United States increasingly stepped in to support the South Vietnamese leaders due to the Domino theory, which theorized that if one nation would turn to communism, the surrounding nations were likely to fall like dominoes and become communist as well. The Soviet Union and North Vietnam became important allies together due to the fact that if South Vietnam was successfully taken over by North Vietnam, then communism in East Asia would find its strategic position bolstered. In the eyes of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the growing Soviet-Vietnamese relationship was a disturbing development; they feared an encirclement by the less-than-hospitable Soviet sphere of influence.

The United States and the Soviet Union could not agree on a plan for a proposed 1956 election meant to unify the partitioned Vietnam. Instead, the South held a separate election that was widely considered fraudulent, leading to continued internal conflict with communist factions led by the Viet Cong that intensified through the late 1950s. With supplies and support from the Soviet Union, North Vietnamese forces became directly involved in the ongoing guerrilla war by 1959 and openly invaded the South in 1964.

The United States played an ever-increasing role in supporting South Vietnam through the period. The U.S. had supported French forces in the First Indochina War, sent supplies and military advisers to South Vietnam throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, and eventually took over most of the fighting against both North Vietnam and the Viet Cong by the mid-1960s. By 1968, over 500,000 American troops were involved in the Vietnam War. Due to a lack of clear military success and facing increasingly strident opposition to the war in the U.S., American forces began a slow withdrawal in 1969 while attempting to bolster South Vietnam&#x27;s military so that they could take over the fighting. In accordance with the Paris Peace Accords by 29 March 1973 all U.S. combat forces had left South Vietnam, however North Vietnamese combat forces were allowed to remain in place. North Vietnam attacked South Vietnam in early 1975 and South Vietnam fell on 30 April 1975.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China started talks with the United States in the early 1970s, culminating in high level meetings with Henry Kissinger and later Richard Nixon. These meetings contributed to a re-orientation of Chinese foreign policy toward the United States.

===Cambodia===
Although the Vietnamese Communists and the Khmer Rouge had previously cooperated, the relationship deteriorated when Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot came to power and established Democratic Kampuchea on 17 April 1975. The People&#x27;s Republic of China, on the other hand, also supported the Maoist Khmer Rouge against Lon Nol&#x27;s regime during the Cambodian Civil War and its subsequent take-over of Cambodia. China provided extensive political, logistical and military support for the Khmer Rouge during its rule. After numerous clashes along the border between Vietnam and Cambodia, and with encouragement from Khmer Rouge defectors fleeing purges of the Eastern Zone, Vietnam invaded Cambodia on 25 December 1978. By 7 January 1979, Vietnamese forces had entered Phnom Penh and the Khmer Rouge leadership had fled to western Cambodia. The offensive took the Chinese by surprise, and its Phnom Penh embassy fled to the jungle with the Khmer Rouge where it remained for 15 days.

However, the fall of the Khmer Rouge was not a surprise, but from China&#x27;s perspective, Vietnam&#x27;s occupation of Cambodia threatened China&#x27;s interests on the Indochina peninsula and its position among non-communist Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) states of Southeast Asia. Members of ASEAN saw Vietnam&#x27;s invasion of Cambodia as a blatant violation of international borders and an act of aggression.

===Ethnic minorities===
China supported the ethnic minority United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races against Vietnam during the FULRO insurgency against Vietnam.

The Vietnamese executed collaborators who worked for the Chinese, regardless of ethnicity.

The Chinese received a significant number of defectors from the Thu Lao ethnic minority in Vietnam during the war. During the war China received as migrants the entire A Lù based population of the Phù Lá ethnic minority. China received so many defectors from the ethnic minorities in Vietnam that it raised shock among Vietnam which had to launch a new effort to re-assert dominance over the ethnic minorities and classify them. Post Vietnam War, an insurgency against Vietnam lasted among the indigenous Mon-Khmer and Malayo-Polynesians of the Central Highlands. Assistance was sought from China by the Hmong ethnic minority. The border was frequently crossed by Chinese, Lao, Kinh, Hmong, Yao, Nung, and Tai. The Laotian Hmong and FULRO were both supported against Vietnam by China and Thailand.

In February 1976, Vietnam implemented registration programs in the south. Ethnic Chinese in Vietnam were required to adopt Vietnamese citizenship or leave the country. In early 1977, Vietnam implemented what it described as a purification policy in its border areas to keep Chinese border residents to the Chinese side of the border. Following another discriminatory policy introduced in March 1978, a large number of Chinese fled from Vietnam to southern China. China and Vietnam attempted to negotiate issues related to Vietnam&#x27;s treatment of ethnic Chinese, but these negotiations failed to resolve the issues.

=== Border disputes ===
Border disputes between the two countries were significant in the 1970s. One hundred sixty-four locations on the land border totaling 227 square kilometers were disputed. Because there was not yet clear border demarcation, the countries engaged in a pattern of retaliatory land grabs and violence. The number of border skirmishes increased yearly from 125 in 1974 to 2,175 in 1978. Two rounds of bilateral negotiations on border issues were unsuccessful. While the second round of negotiations, the August 1978 Youyi Pass Incident occurred, in which the Vietnamese army and police expelled 2,500 refugees across the border into China. Vietnamese authorities beat and stabbed refugees during the incident, including 9 Chinese civilian border workers.

After the second round of negotiations failed, China began conducting overflights of the border area and of the Gulf of Tonkin.

===China attacks Vietnam===
By the mid-1970s, the relationship between China and Vietnam was strained. The tensions between the two countries developed in relation to a number of issues, including Vietnam&#x27;s support of the Soviet side during the Sino-Soviet split, Vietnam&#x27;s invasion of Cambodia, Vietnam&#x27;s mistreatment of ethnic Chinese in Vietnam, and border conflicts.

China grew concerned about the strong Soviet influence in Vietnam, fearing that Vietnam could become a pseudo-protectorate of the Soviet Union. Vietnam&#x27;s claim to be the world&#x27;s third largest military power following its victory in the Vietnam War also increased Chinese apprehensions. In the Chinese view, Vietnam was pursuing a regional hegemonic policy in an attempt to control Indochina.

In June 1978, China rescinded the appointment of its consul general to Ho Chi Minh City and informed Vietnam that it must close three of its consulates in China.

On 8 July 1978, the General Political Bureau of the Vietnamese People&#x27;s Army released orders to adopt an offensive strategy against China, including attacking and counterattacking within and beyond the border. Two weeks later, the National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam described China as a direct and dangerous enemy and a &quot;new combat target&quot;. It decided to send personnel abroad to engage in activities in opposition to China.

In July 1978, the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party discussed possible military action against Vietnam in order to disrupt Soviet deployments and, two months later, PLA General Staff recommended punitive actions against Vietnam. By the end of July 1978, China ended all of its aid programs to Vietnam and recalled all of its experts from Vietnam.

In September 1978, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army General Staff reached a consensus in favor of a military campaign against Vietnam. The General Staff viewed the goal of a campaign as to force Vietnam out of Cambodia, to check the Soviet Union&#x27;s and Vietnam&#x27;s regional ambitions in southeast Asia, and to stop Vietnamese encroachments on the border.

The major breakdown in the Chinese view of Vietnam occurred in November 1978. Vietnam joined the CMEA and, on 3 November, the Soviet Union and Vietnam signed a 25-year mutual defense treaty, which made Vietnam the &quot;linchpin&quot; in the Soviet Union&#x27;s &quot;drive to contain China&quot;. (However, the Soviet Union had shifted from open animosity towards more normalized relations with China soon after.) Vietnam called for a special relationship between the three Indochinese countries, but the Khmer Rouge regime of Democratic Kampuchea rejected the idea.

On 8 December 1978, the Central Military Commission ordered the Guangzhou Military Region and Kunming Military Region to prepare for military action against Vietnam by 10 January 1979.

On 25 December 1978, Vietnam invaded Democratic Kampuchea, overrunning most of the country, deposing the Khmer Rouge, and installing Heng Samrin as the head of the new Cambodian government. The move further antagonized China, which now viewed the Soviet Union as capable of encircling its southern border.

Beginning in fall 1978 and continuing through early 1979, Deng Xiaoping made a series of international trips, one goal of which was to gauge world opinion on the issues between China and Vietnam. On 29 January 1979, Deng Xiaoping visited the United States for the first time and told U.S. President Jimmy Carter: &quot;The child is getting naughty, it is time he got spanked&quot; (). Deng sought an endorsement from the United States in order to deter the Soviet Union from intervening when China launched a punitive attack against Vietnam. He informed Carter that China could not accept Vietnam&#x27;s &quot;wild ambitions&quot; and was prepared to teach it a lesson. According to United States National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter reserved judgment, an action which Chinese diplomats interpreted as tacit approval.

Deng returned to China on 8 February 1979, and on 9 February, made the final decision to invade Vietnam. On 11 February, China issued orders to the Guangxi and Yunnan military commands to launch the attack on 17 February. Three days later, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a notice to provincial party organizations, military regions, and government ministries, announcing and explaining its view of the justifications for the upcoming attack on Vietnam. On 15 February, the first day that China could have officially announced the termination of the 1950 Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, Deng Xiaoping declared that China planned to conduct a limited attack on Vietnam. Thus, he further developed China&#x27;s burgeoning cooperation with the United States against the Soviet Union and would take a similar stance later regarding Afghanistan. According to academic Suisheng Zhao, &quot;[t]he proximity in the timing of the military thrust against Vietnam, was to take advantage of the normalization to bluff the Soviets with a nonexistent US endorsement.&quot;

The reason cited for the attack was to support China&#x27;s ally, the Khmer Rouge of Cambodia, in addition to the mistreatment of Vietnam&#x27;s ethnic Chinese minority and the Vietnamese occupation of the Spratly Islands which were claimed by China. To prevent Soviet intervention on Vietnam&#x27;s behalf, Deng warned Moscow the next day that China was prepared for a full-scale war against the Soviet Union; in preparation for this conflict, China put all of its troops along the Sino-Soviet border on an emergency war alert, set up a new military command in Xinjiang, and evacuated an estimated 300,000 civilians from the Sino-Soviet border. In addition, the bulk of China&#x27;s active forces (as many as one-and-a-half million troops) were stationed along China&#x27;s border with the Soviet Union.

The 17 February issue of &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; accuses Vietnam of discrimination against ethnic Chinese populations, of preparing to invade China, and of shooting at civilians and their properties from across the border on its front page. Another article, also on the front page, claims that the Foreign Ministry sent a diplomatic note expressing &quot;the strongest protest&quot; for Vietnamese incursions on Chinese soil.

==Course of war==
On 17 February 1979, a People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) force of about 200,000 troops supported by 200 Type 59, Type 62, and Type 63 tanks entered northern Vietnam in the PLA&#x27;s first major combat operation since the end of the Korean War in 1953.

The PLA invasion was conducted in two directions: western and eastern
* Eastern direction, commanded by Xu Shiyou, aimed to attack Cao Bằng, Lạng Sơn and Quảng Ninh Provinces:
* Western direction, commanded by Yang Dezhi, aimed to attack Ha Tuyen, Hoang Lien Son and Lai Châu Provinces

Vietnam quickly mobilized all its main forces in Cambodia, southern Vietnam and central Vietnam to the northern border. From 18 to 25 February, the 327th Infantry Division of Military District 3 and the 337th Infantry Division of Military District 4 were deployed to join Military District 1 for the defense of northwestern region. From 6 to 11 March the Second Corp (Huong Giang Corp) stationed in Cambodia was deployed back to Hanoi.

The 372nd Air Division in central Vietnam as well as the 917th, 935th and 937th Air Regiments in southern Vietnam were quickly deployed to the north.

The PLA quickly advanced about 15–20 kilometres into Vietnam, with fighting mainly occurring in the provinces of Cao Bằng, Lào Cai and Lạng Sơn. The Vietnamese avoided mobilizing their regular divisions, and held back some 300,000 troops for the defence of Hanoi. The People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (VPA) tried to avoid direct combat and often used guerrilla tactics.

The initial PLA attack soon lost its momentum and a new attack wave was sent in with eight PLA divisions joining the battle. After capturing the northern heights above Lạng Sơn, the PLA surrounded and paused in front of the city in order to lure the VPA into reinforcing it with units from Cambodia. This was the main strategic ploy in the Chinese war plan as Deng did not want to risk escalating tensions with the Soviet Union. After three days of bloody house-to-house fighting, Lạng Sơn fell on 6 March. The PLA then took the southern heights above Lạng Sơn and occupied Sa Pa. The PLA claimed to have crushed several of the VPA regular units. Supporting attacks were also conducted by the PLA at Quảng Ninh Province in the Battle of Mong Cai and Battle of Cao Ba Lanh but were unsuccessful. However, Bangkok analysts gave a completely different count, heavy Vietnamese resistance near Lao Cai in the west and Cao Bang in the middle of the front also resulted in Vietnamese defeats. The Chinese also captured the far northeastern provincial capital, Mong Cai, analysts said. According to Vietnam, since January 1979 Chinese forces performed numerous reconnaissance activities across the border and made 230 violations into Vietnamese land. To prepare for a possible Chinese invasion, the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of Vietnam ordered all armed forces across the border to be on stand-by mode.

On 6 March, China declared that the gate to Hanoi was open and that their punitive mission had been achieved. Coincidentally, the Vietnamese government called, on the same day, for a nationwide general mobilization for the war. Some analysts said that the belligerent Vietnamese language could indicate a desire to counterattack, or simply an attempt to mount a propaganda campaign that would end in a declaration of Vietnamese victory as the Chinese leave the country. During the withdrawal, the PLA used a scorched-earth policy, destroying local infrastructure and looting useful equipment and resources (including livestock), which severely weakened the economy of Vietnam&#x27;s northernmost provinces. The PLA crossed the border back into China on 16 March. Both sides declared victory with China claiming to have crushed the Vietnamese resistance and Vietnam claiming to have repelled the invasion using mostly border militias. Henry J. Kenny, a research scientist for US Center for Naval Analyses, noted most Western writers agree that while Vietnam outperformed the PLA on the battlefield, the PLA&#x27;s seizure of Lang Son did allow the Chinese the option of moving into the Red River Delta and thence into Hanoi. However, Kenny also mentions that Lang Son is farther from Hanoi than it is from the Chinese border, and at least 5 PAVN divisions in the delta remained ready for a counterattack and thirty thousand additional PAVN troops from Cambodia along with several regiments from Laos were moving to their support. Thus, had the PLA decided to attack Hanoi, the PLA would have suffered huge losses.

Contrary to the views above, The New York Times reported that Western intelligence analysts believed that even though the border war was ending, regular troops had to replace provincial Vietnamese troops who suffered high casualties and became disorganized as a result of taking the brunt of the invasion. Vietnam sent one regular division, as well as armor and artillery support units, into the fight at the height of the fighting for Lang Son, which was captured by Chinese forces, but the regular division failed to take the town. The Chinese made their withdrawal announcement following their victory at Lang Son, which Hanoi refused to recognize. Analysts interpreted this as a warning to Vietnam that any military objective there may be taken by China. Analysts claimed that regardless of the outcome of the combat, China had managed to permanently divert Vietnamese troops, supplies, attention, and energy to the border region. This was due to Vietnam&#x27;s intensive resupply and remanning of the border zone.

Despite using a force that did not see major combat since the early 1950s and whose weaponry was inferior to the Vietnamese weaponry, the PLA was considered to have fought well. Most of the weaponry and military vehicles used by the PLA were either obsolete or unfit for combat. In contrast, the Vietnamese forces had a combat-seasoned force and modern weaponry from America and the Soviet Union. The PLA pushed Vietnamese forces from the border and succeeded in severely damaging the area they occupied.

=== Soviet support to Vietnam ===
The Soviet Union, although it did not take direct military action, provided intelligence and equipment support for Vietnam. A large airlift was established by the Soviet Union to move Vietnamese troops from Cambodia to Northern Vietnam. Moscow also provided a total of 400 tanks and armored personnel carriers (APCs), 500 mortar artillery and air defense artillery, 50 BM-21 rocket launchers, 400 portable surface-to-air missiles, 800 anti-tank missiles and 20 jet fighters. About 5,000 to 8,000 Soviet military advisers were present in Vietnam in 1979 to train Vietnamese soldiers.

During the Sino-Vietnamese War, the Soviet Union deployed troops at the Sino-Soviet border and Mongolian-Chinese border as an act of showing support to Vietnam, as well as tying up Chinese troops. However, the Soviets refused to take any direct action to defend their ally.

The Soviet Pacific Fleet also deployed 15 ships to the Vietnamese coast to relay Chinese battlefield communications to Vietnamese forces.

==== Soviet inaction ====
While the Soviet Union deployed naval vessels and supplied materiel to Vietnam, they felt that there was simply no way that they could directly support Vietnam against China; the distances were too great to be an effective ally, and any sort of reinforcements would have to cross territory controlled by China or U.S. allies. The only realistic option would be to restart the unresolved border conflict with China. Vietnam was important to Soviet policy but not enough for the Soviets to go to war over. When Moscow did not intervene, Beijing publicly proclaimed that the Soviet Union had broken its numerous promises to assist Vietnam.

Another reason why Moscow did not intervene was because Beijing had promised both Moscow and Washington that the invasion was only a limited war, and that Chinese forces would withdraw after a short incursion. After moderation by the U.S., Moscow decided to adopt a &quot;wait and see&quot; approach to see if Beijing would actually limit their offense. Because Vietnam&#x27;s anti-air capabilities were among the best in the world at the time and in order to reassure Moscow it was conducting a limited war, Deng Xiaoping ordered the Chinese navy and air force to remain out of the war; only limited support was provided by the air force. When Beijing kept its promise, Moscow did not retaliate.

==Aftermath==
China and Vietnam each lost thousands of troops, and China lost 3.45 billion yuan in overhead, which delayed completion of their 1979–80 economic plan. Following the war, the Vietnamese leadership took various repressive measures to deal with the problem of real or potential collaboration. In the spring of 1979, the authorities expelled approximately 8,000 Hoa people from Hanoi to the southern &quot;New Economic Zones&quot;, and partially resettled the Hmong tribes and other ethnic minorities from the northernmost provinces. In response to the defection of Hoàng Văn Hoan, the Communist Party of Vietnam removed from its ranks pro-Chinese elements and persons who had surrendered to the advancing Chinese troops during the war. In 1979, a total of 20,468 members were expelled from the party.

After the invasion, Vietnam created a puppet government in Cambodia led by Heng Samrin. Samrin was obligated to consult with the Vietnamese on major decisions. Although Vietnam continued to occupy Cambodia, China successfully mobilized international opposition to the occupation, rallying such leaders as Cambodia&#x27;s deposed king Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodian anticommunist leader Son Sann, and high-ranking members of the Khmer Rouge to deny the pro-Vietnamese Cambodian People&#x27;s Party in Cambodia diplomatic recognition beyond the Soviet bloc.

The majority of diplomats and analysts concluded that China&#x27;s long-term strategy was to stretch Vietnamese resources by having the Vietnamese divert their resources from other problems to the border conflict. Problems include Vietnam&#x27;s difficulties integrating South Vietnam with the North, the burden of administrating Laos and occupying Cambodia, and economic problems caused by two years of disastrous weather.

After the war, border skirmishes at the Chinese-Vietnamese border continued, and the Vietnamese were not deterred from maintaining their occupation of Cambodia, increasing its control over Laos and threatening the security of Thailand, which turned Vietnam into a greater threat to ASEAN than before. Also, the Vietnamese government intensified its persecution of overseas Chinese living in Vietnam. Vietnamese authorities confiscated property owned in Vietnam by overseas Chinese, and expelled many Chinese from Vietnam to a number of provinces in southern China.

However, China caused Vietnam to suffer from serious economic and military hardship by threatening to launch a second invasion, and by supporting Pol Pot guerrillas in Cambodia. The Vietnamese government had to spend money on maintaining a military presence at the Chinese-Vietnamese border, and on supporting its puppet government in Cambodia. Vietnam&#x27;s scarce resources were drained, and economic conditions were bad throughout Vietnam.

Assessments of the strategic consequences of the war vary considerably. Journalist Howard W. French quoted some historians of the opinion that &quot;the war was started by Mr. Deng (China&#x27;s then paramount leader Deng Xiaoping) to keep the army preoccupied while he consolidated power...&quot; However, China strengthened its relations with ASEAN countries – particularly Thailand and Singapore – due to their fear of Vietnamese aggression. Singapore&#x27;s Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew wrote in 2000: &quot;The Western press wrote off the Chinese punitive action as a failure. I believe it changed the history of East Asia.&quot; In contrast, Vietnam&#x27;s decreasing prestige in the region led it to be more dependent on the Soviet Union, to which it leased a naval base at Cam Ranh Bay. Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote that &quot;China succeeded in exposing the limits of...[Soviet] strategic reach&quot; and speculated that the desire to &quot;compensate for their ineffectuality&quot; contributed to the Soviets&#x27; decision to intervene in Afghanistan a year later.

===Chinese casualties===
The number of casualties during the war is disputed. Shortly after China had announced the withdrawal of its troops from Vietnam, the state-run Vietnam News Agency claimed that the PLA had suffered over 44,000 casualties, a figure which Western analysts at the time considered to be greatly inflated. Other Vietnamese sources claimed the PLA had suffered 62,500 total casualties, including 550 military vehicles and 115 artillery pieces destroyed. Leaks from Chinese military sources indicate that China suffered 6,954 dead.

Deputy chief of the General Staff Wu Xiuquan revealed in a meeting with a French military delegation that Vietnam suffered 50,000 casualties, whereas China had suffered 20,000 casualties. Regardless of the accuracy of the Vietnamese casualties, it can be concluded that the Chinese losses were severe, according to Daniel Tretiak.

===Vietnamese casualties===
Like their Chinese counterparts, the Vietnamese government has never officially announced any information on its actual military casualties. China estimated that Vietnam lost 57,000 soldiers and 70,000 militia members during the war. The Vietnamese state newspaper &quot;Nhân Dân&quot; claimed that Vietnam suffered more than 10,000 civilian deaths during the Chinese invasion and earlier on 17 May 1979, reported statistics on heavy losses of industry and agricultural properties.

===Prisoners===

The Chinese held 1,636 Vietnamese prisoners and the Vietnamese held 238 Chinese prisoners; they were exchanged in May–June 1979.

=== PLA reforms ===
Deng subsequently used the PLA&#x27;s poor performance to overcome resistance from PLA leadership to further military reforms.

===Sino-Vietnamese relations after the war===


Border skirmishes continued throughout the 1980s, including a significant skirmish in April 1984 and a naval battle over the Spratly Islands in 1988 known as the Johnson South Reef Skirmish. Armed conflict only ended in 1989 after the Vietnamese agreed to fully withdraw from Cambodia. Both nations planned the normalization of their relations in a secret summit in Chengdu in September 1990, and officially normalized ties in November 1991.

In 1999, after many years of negotiations, China and Vietnam signed a border pact. There was an adjustment of the land border, resulting in Vietnam giving China part of its land which was lost during the battle, including the Ai Nam Quan Gate which served as the traditional border marker and entry point between Vietnam and China, which caused widespread frustration within Vietnamese communities.
The December 2007 announcement of a plan to build a Hanoi–Kunming highway was a landmark in Sino-Vietnamese relations. The road will traverse the border that once served as a battleground. It is predicted to contribute to demilitarizing the border region, as well as facilitating trade and industrial cooperation between the nations.

==In popular culture==

===Chinese media===
There are a number of Chinese songs, movies and TV programs depicting and discussing this conflict from the Chinese viewpoint. These vary from the patriotic song &quot;Bloodstained Glory&quot; originally written to laud the sacrifice and service of the Chinese military, to the 1986 film &quot;The Big Parade&quot; which carried veiled criticism of the war. The 1984 Xie Jin film &quot;Wreaths at the Foot of the Mountain&quot; was the earliest mainland China film to depict the war, although its narrative was that the Chinese were on the defensive after Vietnamese attacked the Chinese border first with the objective of Nanning. The male protagonist of the television series &quot;Candle in the Tomb&quot; was a veteran of conflict. The 2017 Chinese movie &quot;Youth&quot; covers the period of the Sino-Vietnamese conflict from the perspective of the larger cultural changes taking place in China during that period of time.

===Vietnamese media===
The war was mentioned in the film &quot;Đất mẹ&quot; (&quot;Motherland&quot;) directed by Hải Ninh in 1980 and &quot;Thị xã trong tầm tay&quot; (&quot;Town at the Fingertips&quot;) directed by Đặng Nhật Minh in 1982. Besides in 1982, a documentary film called &quot;Hoa đưa hương nơi đất anh nằm&quot; (&quot;Flowers over Your Grave&quot;) was directed by Truong Thanh, the film told a story of a Japanese journalist who died during the war.
During the war, there were numerous patriotic songs produced to boost the nationalism of Vietnamese people, including &quot;Chiến đấu vì độc lập tự do&quot; (&quot;Fight for Independence and Freedom&quot;) composed by Phạm Tuyên, &quot;Lời tạm biệt lúc lên đường&quot; (&quot;Farewell When Leaving&quot;) by Vu Trong Hoi, &quot;40 thế kỷ cùng ra trận&quot; (&quot;40 Centuries We Fought Side By Side&quot;) by Hong Dang, &quot;Những đôi mắt mang hình viên đạn&quot; (&quot;The Eyes Shaped Like Bullets&quot;) by Tran Tien and &quot;Hát về anh&quot; (Sing for you) by The Hien.
The Sino-Vietnamese War also appeared in some novels such as: &quot;Đêm tháng Hai&quot; (&quot;Night of February&quot;) written by Chu Lai in 1979 and &quot;Chân dung người hàng xóm&quot; (&quot;Portrait of My Neighbors&quot;) written by Duong Thu Huong in 1979.

==Order of battle==
===Chinese forces===
Although the People&#x27;s Liberation Army vastly outnumbered the Vietnamese forces, the Soviet-Vietnamese alliance compelled the Chinese to deploy the majority of their forces along China&#x27;s northern frontier with the Soviet Union (as well as, to a lesser extent, Soviet-allied Mongolia) as a deterrent to Soviet intervention.

<doc id="537568" wikidata="Q796498" url="?curid=537568" title="Third Indochina War">
<text>The Third Indochina War was a series of interconnected military conflicts, mainly among the various communist factions over strategic influence in Indochina after Communist victory in South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia in 1975. The conflict primarily started due to continued raids and incursions by the Khmer Rouge into Vietnamese territory that they sought to retake. These incursions would result in the Cambodian–Vietnamese War in which the newly unified Vietnam overthrew the Pol Pot regime and the Khmer Rouge, in turn ending the Cambodian genocide. Vietnam had installed a government led by many opponents of Pol Pot, most notably Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge commander. This led to Vietnam&#x27;s occupation of Cambodia for over a decade. The Vietnamese push to completely destroy the Khmer Rouge led to them conducting border raids in Thailand against those who had provided sanctuary.

Vietnam-China relations became tense because Vietnam chose to be pro-Soviet after unification in 1976 instead of being neutral as before. China strongly objected to the invasion of Cambodia. Chinese armed forces launched a punitive operation (Sino-Vietnamese War) in February 1979 and attacked Vietnam&#x27;s northern provinces, determined to contain Soviet/Vietnamese influence and prevent territorial gains in the region.

In order to acquire full control over Cambodia the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam needed to dislodge the remaining Khmer Rouge leaders and units, which had retreated to the remote areas along the Thai-Cambodian border. After the Paris Peace Conference in 1989, the PAVN withdrew from Cambodian territory. Finally regular troop engagements in the region ended after the conclusion of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords.

In Laos, an insurgency is still ongoing, though to a lesser extent since 2007, with the government being supported by both China and Vietnam.

==Background==

===Soviet-Chinese discord===

After Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev became leader of the Soviet Union. His denouncement of Stalin and his purges, the introduction of more moderate communist policies and foreign policy of peaceful coexistence with the West angered China&#x27;s leadership. Mao Zedong had been following a strict Stalinist course, that insisted on the cult of personality as a unifying force of the nation. Disagreements over technical assistance for developing China&#x27;s nuclear weapons and basic economic policies further alienated the Soviets and the Chinese as opposing forces of communist influence across the globe. As decolonization movements began to pick up speed in the 1960s and many such countries descended into violence, both of the communist powers competed for political control of the various nations or competing factions in ongoing civil war fights. Ever more diverging Chinese and Soviet strategic and political doctrines had increased the Sino-Soviet split of the mid-1950s.

===Political developments during the Vietnam War===
The Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam), which had chosen to ally with the USSR, justified incursions into neighbouring Laos and Cambodia during the Second Indochinese War by reference to the international nature of communist revolution, where &quot;Indochina is a single strategic unit, a single battlefield&quot; and the Vietnam People&#x27;s Army&#x27;s pivotal role in bringing this about. However, this internationalism was obstructed by complicated regional historical realities, such as the &quot;timeless oppositions between the Chinese and the Vietnamese on the one hand and the Vietnamese and the Khmers on the other&quot;. North Vietnam intervened in the civil war between the Royal Lao Army and the communist Pathet Lao until the establishment of the Lao People&#x27;s Democratic Republic and the &quot;Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation&quot; signed in July 1977. Permanently stationed North Vietnamese troops secured and maintained vital supply routes and strategic staging sites (Ho Chi Minh trail). From 1958 on, Northern and Southern Vietnamese combat troops also began to infiltrate the remote jungles of eastern Cambodia where they continued the Ho Chi Minh trail. The Cambodian communist insurgents had joined these sanctuaries during the late 1960s. Although co-operation took place, the Khmer communists did not adopt modern socialist doctrines and eventually allied with China.

The complete American withdrawal instantaneously eliminated the principal and common adversary of all the communist powers. The communist regimes of Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos pledged allegiance with one of these two opposing factions.

==Cambodian-Vietnamese war==

After the Fall of Saigon and Phnom Penh in April and May 1975 and the subsequent communist takeover in Laos five months later, Indochina was dominated by communist regimes. Armed border clashes between Cambodia and Vietnam soon flared up and escalated as Khmer Rouge forces advanced deep into Vietnamese territory and raided villages, killing hundreds of civilians. Vietnam counterattacked and in December 1978, NVA troops invaded Cambodia, reaching Phnom Penh in January 1979 and arriving at the Thai border in spring 1979.

However, as China, the U.S. and the majority of the international community opposed the Vietnamese campaign, the remaining Khmer Rouge managed to permanently settle in the Thai-Cambodian border region. In a United Nations Security Council meeting, seven non-aligned members drafted a resolution for a ceasefire and Vietnamese withdrawal which failed due to opposition from the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. Thailand tolerated the presence of the Khmer Rouge on its soil as they helped to contain the Vietnamese and Thai domestic guerillas. Over the course of the following decade, the Khmer Rouge received considerable support from Vietnam&#x27;s enemies and served as a bargaining tool in the Realpolitik of Thailand, China, the ASEAN and the U.S.

===Vietnamese-Thailand conflict===
Khmer Rouge forces operated from inside Thai territory attacking the pro-Hanoi People&#x27;s Republic of Kampuchea&#x27;s government. Similarly Vietnamese forces frequently attacked the Khmer Rouge bases inside Thailand. Eventually Thai and Vietnamese regular troops clashed on several occasions during the following decade. The situation escalated as Thailand&#x27;s territorial sovereignty was violated on numerous occasions. Heavy fighting with many casualties resulted from direct confrontations between Vietnamese and Thai troops. Thailand increased troop strength, purchased new equipment and built a diplomatic front against Vietnam.

==Sino-Vietnamese conflicts==
China attacked Vietnam in response to Vietnam&#x27;s occupation of Cambodia, entered northern Vietnam and captured several cities near the border. On March 6, 1979, China declared that their punitive mission had been successful and withdrew from Vietnam. However, both China and Vietnam claimed victory. The fact that Vietnamese forces continued to stay in Cambodia for another decade implies that China&#x27;s campaign was a strategic failure. On the other hand, the conflict had proven that China had succeeded in preventing effective Soviet support for its Vietnamese ally.

As forces remained mobilized, the Vietnamese Army and the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army engaged in another decade-long series of border disputes and naval clashes that lasted until 1990. These mostly local engagements usually wore out in prolonged stand-offs, as neither side achieved any long-term military gains. By the late 1980s the Vietnamese Communist Party&#x27;s (VCP) began to adopt its &quot;Doi Moi&quot; (renovation) policy and reconsider its China policy in particular. Prolonged hostile relations with China had been recognized as to be detrimental to economic reforms, national security and the regime&#x27;s survival. A number of political concessions opened the way for the normalization process of 1991.

<doc id="537570" wikidata="Q326229" url="?curid=537570" title="William Waldorf Astor">
<text>William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor (31 March 1848 – 18 October 1919) was an American-English attorney, politician, hotelier, publisher and philanthropist. Astor was a scion of the very wealthy Astor family of New York City. He moved to England in 1891, became a British subject in 1899, and was made a peer as Baron Astor in 1916 and Viscount Astor in 1917 for his contributions to war charities. The census-designated place of Waldorf, Maryland is named after him.

==Early life and education==
William Waldorf Astor was born in New York City. He was the only child of the financier and philanthropist John Jacob Astor III (1822–1890) and Charlotte Augusta Gibbes (1825–1887). He studied in Germany and in Italy under the care of private tutors and a governess.

In his early adult years, Astor returned to the United States and went to Columbia Law School, graduating with a LL.B. in 1875. He was called to the United States Bar in 1875. He worked for a short time in law practice and in the management of his father&#x27;s estate of financial and real estate holdings.

==Personal life==

Astor married Mary Dahlgren Paul (born 1858, died 22 December 1894) on 6 June 1878. She is buried in Trinity Church Cemetery Manhattan. They had five children:

* Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor (19 May 1879 — 30 September 1952)
* Pauline Astor (24 September 1880 — 5 May 1972), married soldier and politician Herbert Spender-Clay (1875–1937) in 1904. They had three daughters.

==Politics==
After some time practising law, Astor thought he had found his true calling and an opportunity to make a name for himself outside of his family&#x27;s fortune by entering the political realm. In 1877, with his eyes set on the United States Congress, Astor entered New York City politics as a Republican.

He was elected as a member of the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 11th D.) in 1878; and of the New York State Senate (10th D.) in 1880 and 1881. Astor was likely supported by the boss of the New York State Republican machine, Roscoe Conkling, with whom his family was involved.

In 1880, the Maryland General Assembly voted to rename Beantown in Charles County, Maryland &quot;Waldorf&quot; in honor of him.

In 1881, Astor was defeated by Roswell P. Flower as a candidate for the United States Congress. A second attempt at the seat also resulted in defeat. His shy nature could not handle the political attacks on his character. This was the end of his political career. The press used his political failures as fodder for harsh criticisms.

In 1882, President Chester A. Arthur appointed Astor Minister to Italy, a post he held until 1885. He told Astor, &quot;Go and enjoy yourself, my dear boy.&quot; While living in Rome, Astor developed a lifelong passion for art and sculpture.

==Move to England==

Upon the death of his father in February 1890, Astor inherited a personal fortune that made him the second richest man in America. Economists widely agree that John D. Rockefeller was the wealthiest American of that time.

In 1890 Astor initiated the construction of the luxurious Waldorf Hotel on the site of his former residence. At 13 stories high, it overshadowed the adjacent mansion of his aunt, the socialite Caroline &quot;Lina&quot; Schermerhorn Astor. Lina complained bitterly about the commercial establishment next door. However, in 1897, her son John Jacob Astor IV persuaded her to move away and replaced their mansion with the slightly larger in height and width, Astoria Hotel, which was operated as an extension of the Waldorf; the complex became the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.

In the meantime, the friction had blown up into a feud. Aunt Lina also insisted that she, not William&#x27;s wife Mary, was &quot;the&quot; Mrs. Astor in New York society, just as she had when that title belonged to her husband&#x27;s elder brother&#x27;s wife, Charlotte Astor, when she was alive.

As a result of the conflict, Astor moved with his wife and children to England. He rented Lansdowne House in London until 1893. That year, he purchased a country estate, Cliveden in Taplow, Buckinghamshire, from the Duke of Westminster. In 1899, William Waldorf Astor picked up British citizenship, which drew him further away from American history.

To disappear from public view, in the summer of 1892, Astor faked his own death by having his staff report to American reporters that he had died, apparently from pneumonia. However, the ruse was soon discovered, and Astor was mocked in the press.

In 1895, he built a gothic mansion on London&#x27;s Victoria Embankment at Two Temple Place overlooking the River Thames. He commissioned architect John Loughborough Pearson to design a $1.5 million building, a &quot;crenellated Tudor stronghold&quot; which he used as an office for managing his extensive holdings.

Astor made several business acquisitions while he lived in London. In 1892, he purchased the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, and in 1893 established the &quot;Pall Mall Magazine&quot;. In 1911 he acquired &quot;The Observer&quot;, a national newspaper. In 1912 he sold the &quot;Magazine&quot;, and in 1914 made a present of the &quot;Gazette&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot;, with the building in Newton Street and its contents, to his son Waldorf Astor.

In 1903, he acquired the Hever Castle Estate near Edenbridge, Kent, about 30 miles south of London. The estate of over 3,500 acres had at its centre a castle built in 1270 where Anne Boleyn lived as a child. Astor invested a great deal of time and money in restoring the castle, building what is known as the &quot;Tudor Village&quot;, and creating a lake and lavish gardens. He also added the Italian Garden (including fernery) to display his collection of statuary and ornaments.

In 1906, he gave his eldest son Waldorf Astor and his new daughter-in-law, Nancy Witcher Langhorne, the Cliveden estate as well as the Sancy diamond as wedding presents. Nancy Astor (as she became on her marriage) became Britain&#x27;s first seated female Member of Parliament.

In 1908, building on his success with the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York, Astor financed the Waldorf Hotel in London&#x27;s West End.

==Philanthropy and peerage==
Astor became a British subject in 1899. He continued his philanthropic activities, like his father. Among the charities he supported were the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street (to which he gave $250,000 in 1903); University College London (including a gift of £20,000 in 1902 for professorships); the Cancer Research Fund; Oxford University; Cambridge University; the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children; the British Red Cross Society; Gordon Memorial College, Khartoum; the Soldiers and Sailors Families Association; and the Women&#x27;s Memorial to Queen Victoria. His gifts to war charities included $125,000 to the Prince of Wales&#x27;s National Relief Fund; a similar amount to Princess Louise&#x27;s Officers&#x27; Families Fund; $200,000 to the British Red Cross; $25,000 to Queen Mary&#x27;s Employment Committee; and a similar sum to the Lord Mayor&#x27;s National Bands Fund. He gave $5,000 to King Edward&#x27;s Hospital Fund annually starting with its founding in 1897.
In recognition of his work for charity, on 1 January 1916, he was offered and accepted a peerage of the United Kingdom under the title of Baron Astor. On 3 June 1917, he was elevated to the rank of viscount as the Viscount Astor. The elevation was controversial, as some felt that a rich American had bought his way into the English aristocracy.

==Death==
On 18 October 1919, he unexpectedly died of heart failure in the lavatory of his seaside house at Brighton in Sussex. His ashes were buried under the marble floor of the Astor family chapel (also called the &quot;Octagon Temple&quot;) at Cliveden.

== Descendants ==
Through his son John Jacob Astor, 1st Baron Astor of Hever, he is a great-great-grandfather of Harry Marcus George Lopes (b. 1977), who married Laura Rose Parker Bowles, the second child of Andrew Parker Bowles and Queen Camilla, thus making her the stepdaughter of King Charles III.

<doc id="537572" wikidata="Q2077155" url="?curid=537572" title="Peter Taylor, Baron Taylor of Gosforth">
<text>Peter Murray Taylor, Baron Taylor of Gosforth, (1 May 1930 – 28 April 1997) was the Lord Chief Justice of England from 1992 until 1996.

==Family==
Taylor came from a Yiddish-speaking Jewish parents of Lithuanian descent, Herman Louis Taylor, a doctor, and Raie Helena Taylor (née Shockett). The original family surname was reportedly Teiger or Teicher. His father was born in Leeds; his mother came from the rabbinical Palterovich family who had emigrated to Leeds in 1895. Taylor had a brother, Arthur, and a sister, Dorothy. By the time of his birth, the family lived in Newcastle upon Tyne. Taylor passed the 11-plus and attended the Royal Grammar School. During World War II, Newcastle was subject to bombing raids and Taylor was evacuated to Penrith where he lived in a house without either running water or mains electricity.

==Early career==
In 1951, Taylor won an exhibition to Pembroke College, Cambridge, to study law. He was also a talented pianist, continuing to play for the whole of his life. He graduated in 1953 with an upper second class degree and then read for the Bar, being called in 1954. He chose to practise on the north-eastern circuit around Newcastle and joined the chambers of Norman Harper. He conducted mainly criminal cases, often for the prosecution, and at a very early age &#x27;took silk&#x27; to become a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1967; he occasionally appeared for the defence. On one such occasion, judge Sir Melford Stevenson deemed him a threat to the administration of justice.

==Famous cases==
Taylor attracted attention from 1973 when he appeared for the prosecution in several cases connected to the corrupt architect John Poulson, including that of Poulson himself. Over the next three years, the prosecutions succeeded and many of those involved were jailed. In 1974, Taylor successfully prosecuted Judith Ward who was convicted of a series of IRA bombings (many years later, the conviction was found to have been a miscarriage of justice, mostly through Ward&#x27;s delusions of her own guilt). He also prosecuted Stefan Kiszko in July 1976, in what would become one of the most notorious miscarriages of justice in British Law in the 20th Century. Taylor also took on John Ryman, a fellow Barrister and Labour Member of Parliament for Blyth Valley who was found to have submitted fraudulent election expenses.

The most high-profile trial in which Taylor appeared took place in 1979 and the defendant was former Liberal Party leader Jeremy Thorpe who was accused of conspiracy to murder. Although all involved were acquitted, most observers put this down to the summing-up of the trial judge and the malpractice of the prosecution witnesses; Taylor won praise for his handling of the case. His opening address is frequently quoted; Taylor&#x27;s style of oratory was deliberately concise and straightforward but he had a talent for a punning literary allusion.

==Judge==
Taylor had been first appointed a recorder (part-time judge) in 1969 and served as a recorder in the Crown Court from 1972. After serving as Chairman of the Bar Council for 1979–80, he was made a full High Court judge in the Queen&#x27;s Bench Division, receiving the customary knighthood. One of his first cases saw him give Bromley London Borough Council permission to challenge the Greater London Council&#x27;s &quot;Fare&#x27;s Fair&quot; policy of lowering public transport fares. In 1983, Taylor held that a Pakistani man who had pronounced Talaq and notified the authorities in Pakistan had not divorced his wife according to English law.

In 1984, Taylor largely sided with Mary Whitehouse who brought a case against the Independent Broadcasting Authority over the feature film version of &quot;Scum&quot; (1979); he said the Director-General of the IBA had made &quot;a grave error of judgment&quot; in allowing the film to be shown. The next year, he held that Nottinghamshire police had acted negligently in firing CS gas into a house knowing there would be a fire risk and not having fire engines on standby. In 1987 he stated that he did not accept that a judge could not inquire further when a minister raised a justification of &#x27;national security&#x27; for their actions (the case concerned the telephone tapping of Joan Ruddock).

==Court of Appeal==

In 1988, Taylor was promoted to the Court of Appeal. There he became known to the public on 17 April 1989 when he was commissioned by the government to undertake an inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster two days previously. The Taylor Report he produced led to the introduction of all-seater stadia at all top English football clubs, and the removal of fences around fans sitting areas. Standing accommodation was seen as a risk due to the increased chances of a &quot;crush&quot;, and the security fences which Taylor describes as treating spectators like &quot;prisoners of war&quot; were also a hazard in crushes as they claimed the lives of most of the 96 people who ultimately lost their lives at Hillsborough; 94 of them died on the day of the disaster, a 95th died several days later, and the final victim died in March 1993 having never regained consciousness. 

Taylor&#x27;s recommendations, published on 29 January 1990, stated that all First and Second Division (which became the Premier League and Division One in 1992) stadiums had to be all-seater by August 1994, and that the rest of the Football League should follow suit by August 1999. However, the Football Association later ruled that the smaller clubs could retain standing accommodation provided that their stadiums met safety requirements, while clubs promoted to the upper reaches of the league would be allowed standing accommodation at their stadiums for up to three years after promotion.

Taylor&#x27;s popularity as a former Chairman of the Bar Council and as a fair judge who could plausibly claim to have been in touch with all aspects of British life led to his being considered the favourite to take over from Lord Lane when Lane retired from the job of Lord Chief Justice, a retirement which seemed all the more likely due to the criticism of Lane for his stance on a succession of miscarriages of justice. Taylor was duly appointed when Lane stepped down in 1992, at the same time being created a life peer as Baron Taylor of Gosforth, &quot;of Embleton in the County of Northumberland&quot; on 27 April 1992.

==Lord Chief Justice==

Where Lane had been extremely reticent about giving interviews, Taylor was determined to be as open as possible. Not only did he start his tenure by holding an unprecedented press conference, he appeared as a guest on BBC television&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot; and as a castaway on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. Within a few months of taking over he accepted an invitation to give the annual Dimbleby Lecture on &quot;The judiciary in the nineties&quot; in which he cast himself as a reformer. He supported moves to stop judges wearing wigs in court.

Unlike previous holders of the office, Taylor concentrated almost exclusively on appeals rather than acting as a trial judge. This was partly because a backlog had grown up but also because of the much increased concern over a series of cases going back many years which were being proved to be miscarriages of justice. Taylor differed from his immediate predecessor in considering this an immensely serious issue, and knew from his own experience of prosecuting Judith Ward and Stefan Kiszko that many more cases could come to light. This led him to strong support of the full disclosure of prosecution evidence (he also supported moves towards disclosure of defence evidence).

Taylor was with the grain of public opinion in supporting stronger sentences on drunk drivers who killed, and he also extended the range of defences available to domestic violence victims who fought back. He also extended the concept of murder to include the abortion of unborn children in their mother&#x27;s womb. Due to his unusual openness, his view was often heard on matters of political controversy: he could live with the change to allow juries to draw adverse inferences from a defendant&#x27;s silence when interviewed, but opposed moves restricting the right of an accused to elect trial by jury.

Taylor was profoundly affected by the death of his wife Irene in 1995. Shortly afterwards he was diagnosed with a brain tumour. The last appeal he heard was that of Rosemary West, which he turned down. He stepped down in 1996, although did not go quietly: in a series of speeches in the House of Lords over the next year he strongly attacked proposals from the then Home Secretary, Michael Howard, to introduce mandatory sentencing, which he said &quot;must involve a denial of justice&quot;. Taylor had defended the traditional right of the defendant to silence, a battle ultimately lost, and criticised the delay in setting up a body to review miscarriages of justice, something recommended by the 1993 Royal Commission headed by Viscount Runciman of Doxford.

==Illness and death==
Peter Taylor, Baron Taylor of Gosforth, died of cancer in 1997, aged 66, at his home in Guildford, Surrey. He was survived by three daughters: Ruth, Deborah and Judith; and a son, Louis.

<text>Sir William Vallance Whiteway, (April 1, 1828 – June 24, 1908) was a Newfoundlander politician who was a three time Premier of Newfoundland.

==Life and career==

Born in Littlehempston, Devon, England, Whiteway emigrated to Newfoundland in 1843 and entered the law in 1852. In 1859 he was elected to the House of Assembly as a member of the Conservative Party of Newfoundland and became a supporter of Canadian confederation. He lost his seat in the 1869 election on confederation but returned in 1874 and served as Solicitor-General in the government of Sir Frederick Carter before becoming Premier in 1878 when he succeeded Carter as leader of the Conservatives. He was made a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1865. While serving as Solicitor-General, Whiteway was one of the counsel representing the British Government before the Halifax Fisheries Commission, which adjudicated a dispute over north Atlantic fishing rights between the British Empire and the United States. The Commission gave an award of $5,500,000 to be paid by the United States to the British Government. Newfoundland received $1,000,000 as its share of the award.

Whiteway&#x27;s major policy ambition was the construction of the transinsular railway spanning the island which was begun in 1881 and which he believed would spur economic development of the colony. In 1885 his Conservative party was destroyed by sectarian riots, known as The Harbour Grace Affray, at Harbour Grace which resulted in several Protestants leaving the Whiteway government in protest over its conciliatory attitude towards Catholics. Leading the dissenters was James Spearman Winter, Whiteway&#x27;s Solicitor-General and grand master of Newfoundland&#x27;s Orange Order.

The Orangemen joined with Robert Thorburn, an opponent of Whiteway&#x27;s railway who felt that the colony should focus on the fishery, to form the &quot;Reform Party&quot; and win the 1885 election on a &quot;Protestant Rights&quot; platform.

In Opposition Whiteway founded a new Liberal Party of Newfoundland which won office in 1889 returning Whiteway as Premier on the issue of the railway. His government was forced to resign in 1894, however, due to allegations of electoral corruption in the previous year&#x27;s election.

The Tories had argued that Whiteway&#x27;s Liberals had promised jobs to Newfoundlanders who voted for him and filed petitions in the Supreme Court under the &quot;Corrupt Practices Act&quot; against fifteen Liberal members of the House alleging bribery and corruption. The members were tried and found guilty and their seats were declared vacant. On April 3, 1894, while the trials were still underway, Whiteway asked Governor of Newfoundland Sir Herbert Murray to dissolve the House of Assembly for a new election. The Governor refused and asked the Tory leader, Augustus F. Goodridge to form a government despite the fact that the Tories had only 12 seats to 21 for the Liberals. As Liberal seats were declared vacant due to guilty verdicts the standings in the House at the end of the process in August were 8 Conservatives, 9 Liberals and 19 vacancies. Whiteway himself had been found guilty, his seat declared vacant, and under the provisions of the law, he was barred from seeking election to the House of Assembly or sitting in government.

The Governor enabled Goodridge to remain in office by continually proroguing the House in order to prevent the government&#x27;s fall through a Motion of No Confidence.

By-elections were held throughout the fall in which the Liberals retained the seats they had been disbarred from, losing just two, while picking up two from the Conservatives in return. The last by-election was held on November 12, 1894, a full year after the general election. In the interim, 21 by-elections had been held, resulting in a virtual return to the status quo.

Goodridge remained as premier until December 12, 1894, two days after the failure of two banks crippled the economy. Daniel J. Greene, acting Liberal leader, was sworn in as premier the next day.

His government passed the &quot;Disabilities Removal Act&quot;, which allowed all those members who had been disqualified to run as candidates as well as sit in government. Greene then resigned so that Whiteway could be sworn in as premier for a third time. In the face of Newfoundland&#x27;s financial crisis following the bank crash, Whiteway&#x27;s government began a new round of negotiations with Canada to bring Newfoundland into confederation but the discussions were unsuccessful.

Whiteway&#x27;s Liberals lost the 1897 election, resulting in his retirement from politics. He was succeeded as Liberal leader by Sir Robert Bond.

==Family==

The Hon. William Vallance Whiteway, Q.C., married as his second wife, October 22, 1872, Catherine Anne Davies, daughter of W. H. Davies, of Pictou, Nova Scotia. The couple, who resided at Riverview, St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland had three sons and three daughters. One daughter, Harriet Louise Whiteway, married, June 2, 1897, Peers Davidson, son of the Hon. Mr. Justice Davidson, Montreal.

<doc id="537591" wikidata="Q2619726" url="?curid=537591" title="Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor">
<text>Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor, DL (19 May 1879 – 30 September 1952) was an American-born English politician and newspaper proprietor. He was a member of the Astor family. He was active in minor political roles. He was devoted to charitable projects, and with his more famous wife Nancy became a prominent fixture in upper class English society.

==Early life==
Astor was born in New York City. He was the eldest son of William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor, and Mary Dahlgren Paul. His younger brothers were John Rudolph Astor (who died young) and John Jacob Astor V, Baron Astor of Hever. He spent much of his life travelling and living in Europe before his family settled in England in 1889. There Waldorf attended Eton College and New College, Oxford, where he excelled as a sportsman, earning accolades for both fencing and polo. For the Oxford University Polo Club he played side on side with Devereux Milburn in successive Varsity Matches, winning by a margin of 14 goals on both occasions.

==Marriage and children==
In 1905, while a passenger on an Atlantic voyage returning to Britain, Astor met Nancy Langhorne Shaw, a divorced woman with a young son (Robert Gould Shaw III). Coincidentally, both he and Mrs Shaw shared the same birthdate, 19 May 1879, and both were American. After a rapid courtship, the two married in May 1906. As a wedding gift, Waldorf&#x27;s father gave him and his bride the Sancy diamond and the family estate at Cliveden, which Nancy redecorated and modernised with the installation of electricity.

* William Waldorf Astor II, 3rd Viscount Astor (13 August 1907 — 7 March 1966)
* Nancy Phyllis Louise Astor (22 March 1909 — 2 March 1975)
* Francis David Langhorne Astor (5 March 1912 — 6 December 2001)
* Michael Langhorne Astor (10 April 1916 — 26 February 1980)
* Major Sir John Jacob &quot;Jakie&quot; Astor VII (29 August 1918 — 10 September 2000)

Through his wife Astor developed an interest in social reform.

==Public career==
Nancy also encouraged her husband to launch a career in politics. Though defeated in an initial attempt to win election to the House of Commons in the January 1910 general election, Astor won election as a Unionist for the borough of Plymouth in the December 1910 general election. He held the seat until the constituency was abolished in 1918, after which he moved to the borough of Plymouth Sutton. Despite his political affiliation, Astor quickly demonstrated his independence by his support for the so-called &quot;People&#x27;s Budget&quot; and the National Insurance Act of 1911.

In 1911, Astor was approached by James Louis Garvin, the editor of &quot;The Observer&quot;, about purchasing the newspaper from its owner, the press baron Lord Northcliffe. Northcliffe and Garvin had a disagreement over the issue of Imperial Preference, and Northcliffe had given Garvin the option of finding a buyer for the paper. Astor convinced his father to purchase the paper, which William did on the condition that Garvin also agree to edit the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, which was also a property of the Astor family. Though his father provided the funds, it was Waldorf who was in charge of the paper, and he developed a harmonious working relationship with Garvin. William formally turned over ownership of both papers to his son in 1915, who promptly sold the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; but retained ownership of &quot;The Observer&quot;.

Following the outbreak of the First World War, Astor joined the Army. Having been diagnosed with a bad heart, Astor was unable to serve in combat and instead fought waste and inefficiency in munitions production. He was appointed an Inspector of Administrative Services, with the temporary rank of major, on 20 October 1914, serving until January 1917, when he resigned his commission and was granted the honorary rank of major. When his friend David Lloyd George became prime minister and formed a new coalition government, Astor became his parliamentary private secretary. In 1918 he served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food and from 1919 until 1921 he served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health while also playing a prominent role as a member of Lloyd George&#x27;s &quot;garden suburb&quot; of advisers.

In 1916, father William Waldorf Astor was elevated to the peerage as Viscount Astor. Upon the death of his father in October 1919, Waldorf Astor succeeded to the viscountcy and became the 2nd Viscount Astor despite Waldorf&#x27;s attempts to disclaim the title. Now a member of the House of Lords, Astor was forced to forfeit his seat in the House of Commons, though he remained active in the government. The seat was won subsequently in a by-election by Astor&#x27;s wife Nancy, who became the second woman elected to the House of Commons and the first woman to take her seat in the House, after the first woman elected, Constance Markievicz, had declined in accordance with her (Sinn Féin) party&#x27;s policy. Nancy retained the seat until she stepped down in the 1945 general election.

==Later years==
With his political career eclipsed by that of his wife, Waldorf turned to greater involvement in charitable causes. He became governor of the Peabody Trust and Guy&#x27;s Hospital, while his interest in international relations fuelled his involvement with the Royal Institute of International Affairs, and he served as its chairman from 1935 to 1949. He was also a considerable benefactor to the city of Plymouth, and served as its Lord Mayor from 1939 to 1944. He was appointed Honorary Colonel of the Devonport, Plymouth-based Devonshire Heavy Brigade, Royal Artillery of the Territorial Army on 5 April 1929.

Astor first got involved in horseracing, whilst an undergraduate, when he purchased a filly called Conjure for 100 guineas. He later bought two other fillies/mares called Maid of the Mist and Popinjay and these three became the foundation mares of Astor&#x27;s Cliveden Stud that he established near to his home. He became a successful owner-breeder and in all won 11 Classic races. These were; Two Thousand Guineas Stakes:- Craig an Eran (1921), Pay Up (1936) and Court Martial (1945); One Thousand Guineas Stakes:- Winkipop (1910) and Saucy Sue (1925); Oaks Stakes:- Sunny Jane (1917), Pogrom (1922), Saucy Sue (1925), Short Story (1926) and Pennycomequick (1929); and St Leger Stakes:- Book Law (1927). He famously never won the Derby but had the second placed horse 5 times. In addition to these successes he had 4 winners of the Eclipse Stakes, 3 winners of the St. James&#x27;s Palace Stakes and 2 winners of the Champion Stakes. To this day he still holds the record for the number of winners (7) of Royal Ascot&#x27;s important Coronation Stakes. He bred all of these horses and they all emanated from his three foundation mares.

In 1950, in poor health, he decided to withdraw from racing. He handed over his stud to his eldest son William and divided his bloodstock between William and his youngest son Jakie (John Jacob). The two brothers tossed a coin and then took alternate choices of the thoroughbred stock. The eldest son continued using his racing colours of pale blue and pink and Jakie&#x27;s colours were a variation on this.

During the military buildup in Germany in the 1930s, the Astors promoted entente with Germany, seen by critics as appeasement of Hitler. Many of their associates felt sympathy for the state of Germany after World War I, feared Communism, and supported the position of the British government. Astor had antisemitic views and in the 1930s he told Thomas Jones that Germany was criticised because, &quot;Newspapers are influenced by those firms which advertise so largely in the press and are frequently under Jewish control.&quot;

In 1940, they urged Neville Chamberlain to resign and supported Churchill as replacement. He also supported war against Germany when it came although both remained uncomfortable with Joseph Stalin as an ally (from 1941). His son David Astor, who became owner and editor of &quot;The Observer&quot; in 1948, never forgave Claud Cockburn and his newssheet &quot;The Week&quot; for attacks on the &quot;Cliveden Set&quot;.

The Astor family donated Cliveden Estate in Buckinghamshire to the National Trust in 1942.

Viscount Astor died on 30 September 1952 at Cliveden near Taplow, England, and was buried in the Octagon Temple at Cliveden. His eldest son Bill succeeded him as Viscount.

<text>The Radicals were a loose parliamentary political grouping in Great Britain and Ireland in the early to mid-19th century who drew on earlier ideas of radicalism and helped to transform the Whigs into the Liberal Party.

== History ==
=== Early Radicals ===
The Radical movement arose in the late 18th century to support parliamentary reform, with additional aims including lower taxes and the abolition of sinecures. John Wilkes&#x27;s reformist efforts in the 1760s, as editor of &quot;The North Briton&quot; and as an MP, were seen as radical at the time, but support dropped away after the Massacre of St George&#x27;s Fields in 1768. Working class and middle class &quot;Popular Radicals&quot; agitated to demand the right to vote and assert other rights, including freedom of the press and relief from economic distress, while &quot;Philosophic Radicals&quot; strongly supported parliamentary reform, but were generally hostile to the arguments and tactics of the Popular Radicals. However, the term &quot;Radical&quot; itself, as opposed to &quot;reformer&quot; or &quot;Radical Reformer&quot;, only emerged in 1819 during the upsurge of protest following the successful conclusion of the Napoleonic War. Henry &quot;Orator&quot; Hunt was the main speaker at the Manchester meeting in 1819 that ended in the Peterloo Massacre; Hunt was elected MP for the Preston division in 1830–1832. The &quot;root and branch&quot; of the reforms which the adjective radical suggests, and at the time still strongly in concept denoted by reference to all its previous main uses, is the English constitution, which is not codified or restricted to particular customs, laws or documents.

=== Radicals and the Great Reform Act ===
Radicals inside and outside Parliament were divided over the merits of the Whig Reform Act 1832. Some continued to press for the ballot and universal suffrage, but the majority (as mobilised in unions like the Birmingham Political Union) saw abolition of the rotten boroughs as a major step towards the destruction of what they called &quot;Old Corruption&quot; or &quot;The Thing&quot;: &quot;In consequence of the boroughs, all our institutions are partial, oppressive, and aristocratic. We have an aristocratic church, an aristocratic bar, an aristocratic game-code, aristocratic taxation...all is privilege&quot;.

The 1832 parliament elected on the new franchise – which raised the percentage of the adult population eligible to vote from some 3% to 6% – contained some 50 or 60 Radicals. This number shortly doubled in the 1835 election, leading many to envisage a House of Commons eventually divided between Radicals on the one side and conservatives (Tories and Whigs) on the other.

In fact, the Radicals failed either to take over an existing party, or to create a new, third force and there were three main reasons. The first was the continuing strength of Whig electoral power in the half-century following the 1832 Act. The latter had expressly been designed to preserve Whig landlord influence in the counties and the remaining small borough – one reason a radical like Henry Hetherington condemned the bill as &quot;an invitation to the shopocrats of the enfranchised towns to join the Whiggocrats of the country&quot;. Whigs were also able to profit in two-member constituencies from electoral pacts made with a more reforming candidate.

Secondly, there was the widening body of reforming opinion inside (and outside) Parliament concerned with other, unrelated causes, including international liberalism, anti-slavery, educational and pro-temperance reforms, admissibility of non-Anglicans (&quot;nonconformists&quot;) to positions of power. The latter expanded later to disestablishmentarianism which replaced the old local government units of the simple parish unit vestry by the mid-nineteenth century, devising instead civil (non-religious) parishes for almost all areas.

Thirdly, the Radicals were always more a body of opinion than a structured force. They lacked any party organisation, formal leadership, or unified ideology. Instead, humanitarian Radicals opposed philosophic Radicals over the Factory Acts; political Radicals seeking a slimmed-down executive opposed Benthamite interventionists; universal suffrage men competed for time and resources with free traders – the Manchester men.

By 1859, the Radicals had come together with the Whigs and the anti-protectionist Tory Peelites to form the Liberal Party, though with the New Radicalism of figures like Joseph Chamberlain they continued to have a distinctive political influence into the closing years of the nineteenth century.

=== Continuing agitation and reform ===
Following the First Reform Act, popular demand for wider suffrage was taken up by the mainly working-class movement Chartism. Meanwhile, Radical leaders like Richard Cobden and John Bright in the middle class Anti-Corn Law League emerged to oppose the existing duties on imported grain which helped farmers and landowners by raising the price of food, but which harmed consumers and manufacturers. After the success of the League on the one hand and the failure of Chartist mass demonstrations and petitions in 1848 to sway parliament on the other, demand for suffrage and parliamentary reform slowly re-emerged through the parliamentary radicals.

By 1866, with agitation from John Bright and the Reform League, the Liberal Prime Minister Earl Russell introduced a modest bill which was defeated by both Tories and reform Liberals, forcing the government to resign. A Conservative minority government led by the Earl of Derby and Benjamin Disraeli took office and introduced the Reform Act 1867 – which almost doubled the electorate, giving many working men the vote – in a somewhat opportunistic party fashion.

Further Radical pressure led to the Ballot Act 1872 and the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Act of 1883, followed by the Representation of the People Act 1884. Progressive liberals like John Morley and Joseph Chamberlain continued to value radicalism as a unifying bridge between the classes, and a common goal. However, in 1886 Chamberlain helped form the breakaway Liberal Unionist Party that mostly supported Conservative governments. The long career of David Lloyd George saw him moving from radical views in the 1890s to becoming Prime Minister in a postwar coalition with the Conservatives in 1918. From 1900 and the rise of the Labour Party and the gradual achievement of the majority of the original Radical goals, Parliamentary Radicalism ceased to function as a political force in the early twentieth century.

=== Disappearance as a political party ===
Radicals were absorbed by the Liberal Party by 1859, but did show their presence as a faction of the Liberal Party.

== Literary echoes ==
* &quot;Felix Holt, the Radical&quot; (1866), a social novel written by George Eliot, offered a positive view of an idealistic and well-educated committed Radical.
* &quot;Beauchamp&#x27;s Career&quot; (1875), a satirical novel written by George Meredith. It portrays life and love in upper-class Radical circles and satirises the Conservative establishment.
* Anthony Trollope offered a more shaded view in his outline for &quot;The Way We Live Now&quot; (1875), describing his anti-hero as &quot;A scapegrace. Has glimmerings of Radical policy for the good of the people&quot;. Economically liberal and laissez-faire, Trollope finds non-radicalism bucolic, extolling the rural county of Suffolk: &quot;The people are hearty, and radicalism is not quite so rampant as it is elsewhere. The poor people touch their hats, and the rich people think of the poor.&quot;
* &quot;The Difference Engine&quot; (1990), an alternative history (&quot;Steampunk&quot;) novel by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling, partially based on &quot;Sybil, or The Two Nations&quot; by Benjamin Disraeli, which includes a fictional Industrial Radical Party.

<text>Charles Malo François Lameth (; 5 October 1757 – 28 December 1832) was a French politician and soldier.

==Early life==
Charles Malo François Lameth was born on 5 October 1757 in Paris. His father was Louise Charles de Lameth and his mother, Marie Thérèse de Broglie. His mother was the sister of the Marshall de Broglie and a favourite of Marie Antoinette.

==Career==
He was in the retinue of the comte d&#x27;Artois (future King Charles X), and became an officer in a cuirassier regiment. He served in the American War of Independence, and was a hero of the Battle of Yorktown in 1781. He was a Knight of the Order of Malta and a Knight of the Order of Saint Louis.

Although he married a rich heiress from Saint Domingue, he was a founding member of the Society of the Friends of the Blacks in 1788.

He was deputy to the Estates-General of 1789, for the nobility, and was one of the first aristocrats to renounce his privileges on the night of 4 August 1789. He continued to serve in the National Assembly and National Constituent Assembly and in January 1791 repaid to the Treasury the 60,000 francs it had cost Louis XVI to provide him and his brothers with an education at the École Militaire. In November 1790 he fought a duel with the Duc de Castries. The duke wounded him and it was briefly feared that he had tipped his sword with poison. Lameth was so popular that a mob stormed Castries&#x27; house in revenge. As the Assembly began to divide into factions, Lameth, a constitutional monarchist, was identified with the Feuillants and he was arrested in Rouen on 12 August 1792 for protesting against the Attack on the Tuileries. Since the French Revolution moved toward a Republic, he emigrated to Hamburg.

He returned to France under the Consulate, was appointed Brigadier General in 1809 and fought in the Spanish War, and was appointed governor of Würzburg (in the Duchy of Würzburg) under the First Empire. In 1814, he rose to the rank of Lieutenant General. Like his brother Alexandre Lameth (but unlike his other one, Théodore de Lameth), Charles joined the Bourbon camp after the Restoration, succeeding Alexandre as deputy in 1829. In the final years of his life, he was nonetheless a noted supporter of the July Monarchy.

==Personal life==

He married Marie Anne Picot. They had two children. They resided at the Château d&#x27;Hénencourt in Hénencourt, Somme.

He died on 28 December 1832.

<text>Alan Cooper (born June 3, 1952) is an American software designer and programmer. Widely recognized as the &quot;Father of Visual Basic&quot;, Cooper is also known for his books &quot;About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design&quot; and &quot;The Inmates Are Running the Asylum: Why High-Tech Products Drive Us Crazy and How to Restore the Sanity&quot;. As founder of Cooper, a leading interaction design consultancy, he created the Goal-Directed design methodology and pioneered the use of personas as practical interaction design tools to create high-tech products. On April 28, 2017, Alan was inducted into the Computer History Museum&#x27;s Hall of Fellows &quot;for his invention of the visual development environment in Visual BASIC, and for his pioneering work in establishing the field of interaction design and its fundamental tools.&quot;

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Alan Cooper grew up in Marin County, California, United States, where he attended the College of Marin, studying architecture. He learned programming and took on contract programming jobs to pay for college.

In 1975, soon after he left college and as the first microcomputers became available, Alan Cooper founded his first company, Structured Systems Group (SSG), in Oakland, California, which became one of the first microcomputer software companies. SSG&#x27;s software accounting product, General Ledger, was sold through ads in popular magazines such as &quot;Byte&quot; and &quot;Interface Age&quot;. This software was, according to the historical account in Fire in the Valley (by Paul Freiberger and Michael Swaine), “probably the first serious business software for microcomputers.” It was both the start of Cooper&#x27;s career as a software author and the beginning of the microcomputer software business. Ultimately, Cooper developed a dozen original products at Structured Systems Group before he sold his interest in the company in 1980.

Early on, Cooper worked with Gordon Eubanks to develop, debug, document, and publish his business programming language, CBASIC, an early competitor to Bill Gates&#x27; and Paul Allen&#x27;s Microsoft BASIC. Eubanks wrote CBASIC’s precursor, BASIC-E as a student project while at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California with professor Gary Kildall. When Eubanks left the Navy, he joined Kildall’s successful operating system company, Digital Research, Inc., in Monterey. Soon thereafter, Eubanks and Kildall invited Cooper to join them at Digital Research as one of four founders of their research and development department. After two years at DRI, Cooper departed to develop desktop application software by himself.

During the 1980s, Alan Cooper authored several business applications including &quot;Microphone II&quot; for Windows and an early, critical-path project management program called &quot;SuperProject&quot;. Cooper sold SuperProject to Computer Associates in 1984, where it achieved success in the business-to-business marketplace.

=== Visual Basic ===
In 1988, Alan Cooper created a visual programming language (code-named “Ruby”) that allowed Windows users to build “Finder”-like shells. He called it “a shell construction set.&quot; After he demonstrated Ruby to Bill Gates, Microsoft purchased it. At the time, Gates commented that the innovation would have a “profound effect” on their entire product line. Microsoft initially decided not to release the product as a shell for users, but rather to transform it into a professional development tool for their QuickBASIC programming language called Visual Basic, which was widely used for business application development for Windows computers.

Cooper&#x27;s dynamically installable control facility, which became famous as the “VBX” interface, was a well-known component of &quot;Ruby&quot;. This innovation allowed any 3rd party developer to write a widget (control) as a DLL, put it in the Visual Basic directory, and Visual Basic would find it, communicate with it, and present it to the user as a seamless part of the program. The widget would appear in the tool palette and appropriate menus, and users could incorporate it into their Visual Basic applications. The invention of the “VBX” interface created an entire new marketplace for vendors of these “dynamically installable controls.” As a result of Cooper&#x27;s work, many new software companies were able to deliver Windows software to market in the 1990s.

The first book ever written about Visual Basic, &quot;The Waite Group’s Visual Basic How-To&quot; by Mitchell Waite, is dedicated to Alan Cooper. In his dedication, the author calls Cooper the “Father of Visual Basic.” This nickname has often served as Cooper&#x27;s one-line resume.

In 1994, Bill Gates presented Cooper with the first Windows Pioneer Award for his contributions to the software industry. During the presentation, Gates took particular note of Cooper&#x27;s innovative work creating the VBX interface.

In 1998, the SVForum honored Cooper with its Visionary Award.

=== Interaction design and user experience ===
Early in his career, Cooper began to critically consider the accepted approach to software construction. As he reports in his first book, he believed something important was missing—software authors were not asking, “How do users interact with this?” Cooper&#x27;s early insights drove him to create a design process, focused not on what could be &quot;coded&quot; but on what could be &quot;designed&quot; to meet users’ needs.

In 1992, in response to a rapidly consolidating software industry, Cooper began consulting with other companies, helping them design their applications to be more user friendly. Within a few years, Alan Cooper had begun to articulate some of his basic design principles. With his clients, he championed a design methodology that puts the users’ needs first. Cooper interviewed the users of his client&#x27;s products and discovered the common threads that made these people happy. Born of this practice was the use of &quot;personas&quot; as design tools. Cooper preached his vision in two books. His ideas helped to drive the user experience movement and define the craft that would come to be called “interaction design.”

==== About Face ====
Cooper&#x27;s best-selling first book, &quot;About Face: The Essentials of User Interface Design,&quot; was first published in 1995. In it, Cooper introduces a comprehensive set of practical design principles, essentially a taxonomy for software design. By the second edition, as the industry and profession evolved, “interface design” had become the more precise “interaction design.” The basic message of this book was directed at programmers: Do the right thing. Think about your users. The book is now in its fourth edition, entitled&quot; About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design&quot;, and is considered a foundation text for the professional interaction designer. Cooper introduced the ideas of software application posture such as a &quot;sovereign posture&quot; where an application uses most of the space and waits for user input or a &quot;transient posture&quot; for software that does not run or engage with the user all the time. With websites he discusses &quot;informational&quot; and &quot;transactional&quot; postures. 
==== The Inmates Are Running the Asylum ====
 In his 1998 book, &quot;The Inmates Are Running the Asylum: Why High-Tech Products Drive Us Crazy and How to Restore the Sanity&quot;, Alan Cooper outlined his methodology, called Goal-Directed design, based on the concept that software should speed the user towards his or her ultimate goal rather than ensnare him or her in computer minutiae. In the book, Cooper introduced a new concept that he called &quot;personas&quot; as a practical interaction design tool. Based on a brief discussion in the book, personas rapidly gained popularity in the software industry due to their unusual power and effectiveness. Today, the concepts of interaction design strategy and the use of personas have been broadly adopted across the industry. Cooper directs the message of his second book to the businessperson: know your users’ goals and how to satisfy them. You need interaction design to do the thing right. Cooper advocates for integrating design into business practice in order to meet customer needs and to build better products faster by doing it right the first time.

Alan Cooper&#x27;s current focus is on how to effectively integrate the advances of interaction design with the effectiveness of agile software development methods. Cooper regularly speaks and blogs about this on his company&#x27;s website.

===&quot;Cooper&quot;===
Cooper has a user experience design and strategy consulting firm headquartered in San Francisco with an office in New York. Cooper is credited with inventing several widely used design concepts, including goal-directed design, personas, and pair design. It was founded by Sue Cooper and Alan Cooper in 1992 in Menlo Park, California, under the name &#x27;Cooper Software,&#x27; then changing the name to &#x27;Cooper Interaction Design&#x27; in 1997. Cooper was the first consulting firm dedicated solely to interaction design. Its original clients were mainly Silicon Valley software and computer hardware companies.

The company uses a human-centered methodology called “goal-directed design” that emphasizes the importance of understanding the user&#x27;s desired end-state and their motivations for getting there.

In 2002, Cooper began offering training classes to the public including topic as interaction design, service design, visual design, and design leadership.
Cooper has served as the President of Cooper (formerly Cooper Interaction Design), a user experience and interaction design consultancy in San Francisco, California, since its founding in 1992. Cooper helps their customers with interaction design challenges and offers training courses in software design and development topics, including their Goal-Directed design (under the CooperU brand).

In 2017, Cooper became part of Designit, a strategic design arm of Wipro Digital. Cooper Professional Education continued to exist as a teaching and learning division of Designit until it closed its doors to business on May 29, 2020.

<doc id="537599" wikidata="Q295240" url="?curid=537599" title="AMP-activated protein kinase">
<text>5&#x27; AMP-activated protein kinase or AMPK or 5&#x27; adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase is an enzyme (EC 2.7.11.31) that plays a role in cellular energy homeostasis, largely to activate glucose and fatty acid uptake and oxidation when cellular energy is low. It belongs to a highly conserved eukaryotic protein family and its orthologues are SNF1 in yeast, and SnRK1 in plants. It consists of three proteins (subunits) that together make a functional enzyme, conserved from yeast to humans. It is expressed in a number of tissues, including the liver, brain, and skeletal muscle. In response to binding AMP and ADP, the net effect of AMPK activation is stimulation of hepatic fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis, stimulation of skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake, inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, lipogenesis, and triglyceride synthesis, inhibition of adipocyte lipogenesis, inhibition of adipocyte lipolysis, and modulation of insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells.

It should not be confused with cyclic AMP-activated protein kinase (protein kinase A).

== Structure ==

AMPK is a protein complex that is formed by α, β, and γ subunits. Each of these three subunits takes on a specific role in both the stability and activity of AMPK. Specifically, the γ subunit includes four particular Cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) domains, giving AMPK its ability to sensitively detect shifts in the AMP/ATP ratio. AMPK is deactivated upon AMP displacement by ATP at CBS site 3, suggesting CBS3 to be the primary allosteric regulatory site. The four CBS domains create two binding sites for AMP commonly referred to as Bateman domains. Binding of one AMP to a Bateman domain cooperatively increases the binding affinity of the second AMP to the other Bateman domain. As AMP binds both Bateman domains the γ subunit undergoes a conformational change which exposes the catalytic domain found on the α subunit. It is in this catalytic domain where AMPK becomes activated when phosphorylation takes place at threonine-172 (on α1 isoform) or Thr-174 (on α2 isoform) by an upstream AMPK kinase (AMPKK). The α, β, and γ subunits can also be found in different isoforms: the γ subunit can exist as either the γ1, γ2 or γ3 isoform; the β subunit can exist as either the β1 or β2 isoform; and the α subunit can exist as either the α1 or α2 isoform. Although the most common isoforms expressed in most cells are the α1, β1, and γ1 isoforms, it has been demonstrated that the α2, β2, γ2, and γ3 isoforms are also expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle.

The following human genes encode AMPK subunits:
* α – &quot;PRKAA1&quot;, &quot;PRKAA2&quot;

The crystal structure of mammalian AMPK regulatory core domain (α C terminal, β C terminal, γ) has been solved in complex with AMP, ADP or ATP.

== Regulation ==
Due to the presence of isoforms of its components, there are 12 versions of AMPK in mammals, each of which can have different tissue localizations, and different functions under different conditions. AMPK is regulated allosterically and by post-translational modification, which work together.

If residue Thr-172 of AMPK&#x27;s α1-subunit (or Thr-174 of AMPK&#x27;s α2-subunit) is phosphorylated, AMPK is activated around 100-fold; access to that residue by phosphatases is blocked if AMP or ADP can block access for and ATP can displace AMP and ADP. That residue is phosphorylated by at least three kinases (liver kinase B1 (LKB1), which works in a complex with STRAD and MO25, Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase II-(CAMKK2), and TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)) and is dephosphorylated by three phosphatases (protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A); protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) and Mg2+-/Mn2+-dependent protein phosphatase 1E (PPM1E)).

Regulation of AMPK by CaMKK2 requires a direct interaction of these two proteins via their kinase domains. The interaction of CaMKK2 with AMPK only involves the α and β subunits of AMPK (AMPK γ is absent from the CaMKK2 complex), thus rendering regulation of AMPK in this context to changes in calcium levels but not AMP or ADP.

AMPK is regulated allosterically mostly by competitive binding to the CBS sites on its γ subunit between ATP (which allows phosphatase access to Thr-172) and AMP or ADP (each of which blocks access to phosphatases). It thus appears that AMPK is a sensor of AMP/ATP or ADP/ATP ratios and thus cell energy level. AMPK undergoes a large conformational change upon ATP binding. A region on the α subunit known as the kinase domain (KD) dissociates from its active-state conformation and loosely associates with the γ subunit ~100Å away. The KD also rotates ~180° in the conformational change. Upon KD dissociation, the active loop (AL) of the α subunit which contains the critical phosphorylated Thr residue is fully exposed to upstream phosphatases. This conformational change represents a plausible mechanism for AMPK modulation. When cellular energy states are low (high AMP/ATP or ADP/ATP levels), AMPK adopts the KD-associated conformation and AMPK is protected from dephosphorylation and remains activated. When cellular energy states are high, AMPK adopts the KD-displaced conformation, the AL is exposed to upstream phosphatases, and AMPK is deactivated.

The pharmacological compounds Merck Compound 991 and Abbott A769662 bind to the allosteric drug and metabolism site (ADaM) on the β subunit and have been shown to activate AMPK up to 10-fold. ADaM site binding may have roles in AMPK activation as well as protection against dephosphorylation.

There are other mechanisms by which AMPK is inhibited or activated by insulin, leptin, and diacylglycerol by inducing various other phosphorylations.

AMPK may be inhibited or activated by various tissue-specific ubiquitinations.

It is also regulated by several protein-protein interactions, and may either be activated or inhibited by oxidative factors; the role of oxidation in regulating AMPK was controversial as of 2016.

== Function ==
When AMPK phosphorylates acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) or sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), it inhibits synthesis of fatty acids, cholesterol, and triglycerides, and activates fatty acid uptake and β-oxidation.

AMPK stimulates glucose uptake in skeletal muscle by phosphorylating Rab-GTPase-activating protein TBC1D1, which ultimately induces fusion of GLUT4 vesicles with the plasma membrane. AMPK stimulates glycolysis by activating phosphorylation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 2/3 and activating phosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase, and it inhibits glycogen synthesis through inhibitory phosphorylation of glycogen synthase. In the liver, AMPK inhibits gluconeogenesis by inhibiting transcription factors including hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) and CREB regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2).

AMPK inhibits the energy-intensive protein biosynthesis process and can also force a switch from cap-dependent translation to cap-independent translation, which requires less energy, by phosphorylation of TSC2, RPTOR, transcription initiation factor 1A.66, and eEF2K. When TSC2 is activated it inhibits mTORC1. As a result of inhibition of mTORC1 by AMPK, protein synthesis comes to a halt. Activation of AMPK signifies low energy within the cell, so all of the energy consuming pathways like protein synthesis are inhibited, and pathways that generate energy are activated to restore appropriate energy levels in the cell.

AMPK activates autophagy by directly and indirectly activating ULK1. AMPK also appears to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis by regulating PGC-1α which in turn promotes gene transcription in mitochondria. AMPK also activates anti-oxidant defenses.

== Clinical significance ==

=== Exercise/training ===

Many biochemical adaptations of skeletal muscle that take place during a single bout of exercise or an extended duration of training, such as increased mitochondrial biogenesis and capacity, increased muscle glycogen, and an increase in enzymes which specialize in glucose uptake in cells such as GLUT4 and hexokinase II are thought to be mediated in part by AMPK when it is activated. Additionally, recent discoveries can conceivably suggest a direct AMPK role in increasing blood supply to exercised/trained muscle cells by stimulating and stabilizing both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Taken together, these adaptations most likely transpire as a result of both temporary and maintained increases in AMPK activity brought about by increases in the AMP:ATP ratio during single bouts of exercise and long-term training.

During a single acute exercise bout, AMPK allows the contracting muscle cells to adapt to the energy challenges by increasing expression of hexokinase II, translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, for glucose uptake, and by stimulating glycolysis. If bouts of exercise continue through a long-term training regimen, AMPK and other signals will facilitate contracting muscle adaptations by escorting muscle cell activity to a metabolic transition resulting in a fatty-acid oxidation approach to ATP generation as opposed to a glycolytic approach. AMPK accomplishes this transition to the oxidative mode of metabolism by upregulating and activating oxidative enzymes such as hexokinase II, PPAR-α, PPAR-δ, PGC-1, UCP-3, cytochrome C and TFAM.

Mutations in the skeletal muscle calcium release channel (RYR1) underlies a life- threatening response to heat in patients with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS). Upon acute exposure to heat, these mutations cause uncontrolled Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, leading to sustained muscle contractures, severe hyperthermia, and sudden death. At basal conditions, the temperature-dependent Ca2+ leak also leads to increased energy demand and activation of energy sensing AMP kinase (AMPK) in skeletal muscle. The activated AMPK increases muscle metabolic activity, including glycolysis, which leads to marked elevation of circulating lactate.

AMPK activity increases with exercise and the LKB1/MO25/STRAD complex is considered to be the major upstream AMPKK of the 5’-AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylating the α subunit of AMPK at Thr-172. This fact is puzzling considering that although AMPK protein abundance has been shown to increase in skeletal tissue with endurance training, its level of activity has been shown to decrease with endurance training in both trained and untrained tissue. Currently, the activity of AMPK immediately following a 2 hour bout of exercise of an endurance trained rat is unclear. It is possible that a direct link exists between the observed decrease in AMPK activity in endurance trained skeletal muscle and the apparent decrease in the AMPK response to exercise with endurance training.

Although AMPKα2 activation has been thought to be important for mitochondrial adaptations to exercise training, a recent study investigating the response to exercise training in AMPKα2 knockout mice opposes this idea. Their study compared the response to exercise training of several proteins and enzymes in wild type and AMPKα2 knockout mice. And even though the knockout mice had lower basal markers of mitochondrial density (COX-1, CS, and HAD), these markers increased similarly to the wild type mice after exercise training. These findings are supported by another study also showing no difference in mitochondrial adaptations to exercise training between wild type and knockout mice.

=== Maximum life span ===

The &quot;C. elegans&quot; homologue of AMPK, aak-2, has been shown by Michael Ristow and colleagues to be required for extension of life span in states of glucose restriction mediating a process named mitohormesis.

=== Lipid metabolism ===

One of the effects of exercise is an increase in fatty acid metabolism, which provides more energy for the cell. One of the key pathways in AMPK&#x27;s regulation of fatty acid oxidation is the phosphorylation and inactivation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) converts acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1). CPT-1 transports fatty acids into the mitochondria for oxidation. Inactivation of ACC, therefore, results in increased fatty acid transport and subsequent oxidation. It is also thought that the decrease in malonyl-CoA occurs as a result of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD), which may be regulated by AMPK. MCD is an antagonist to ACC, decarboxylating malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA, resulting in decreased malonyl-CoA and increased CPT-1 and fatty acid oxidation.
AMPK also plays an important role in lipid metabolism in the liver. It has long been known that hepatic ACC has been regulated in the liver by phosphorylation. AMPK also phosphorylates and inactivates 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. HMGR converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA, which is made from acetyl-CoA, into mevalonic acid, which then travels down several more metabolic steps to become cholesterol. AMPK, therefore, helps regulate fatty acid oxidation and cholesterol synthesis.

=== Glucose transport ===
Insulin is a hormone which helps regulate glucose levels in the body. When blood glucose is high, insulin is released from the Islets of Langerhans. Insulin, among other things, will then facilitate the uptake of glucose into cells via increased expression and translocation of glucose transporter GLUT-4. Under conditions of exercise, however, blood sugar levels are not necessarily high, and insulin is not necessarily activated, yet muscles are still able to bring in glucose. AMPK seems to be responsible in part for this exercise-induced glucose uptake. Goodyear et al. observed that with exercise, the concentration of GLUT-4 was increased in the plasma membrane, but decreased in the microsomal membranes, suggesting that exercise facilitates the translocation of vesicular GLUT-4 to the plasma membrane. While acute exercise increases GLUT-4 translocation, endurance training will increase the total amount of GLUT-4 protein available. It has been shown that both electrical contraction and AICA ribonucleotide (AICAR) treatment increase AMPK activation, glucose uptake, and GLUT-4 translocation in perfused rat hindlimb muscle, linking exercise-induced glucose uptake to AMPK. Chronic AICAR injections, simulating some of the effects of endurance training, also increase the total amount of GLUT-4 protein in the muscle cell.

Two proteins are essential for the regulation of GLUT-4 expression at a transcriptional level – myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) and GLUT4 enhancer factor (GEF). Mutations in the DNA binding regions for either of these proteins results in ablation of transgene GLUT-4 expression. These results prompted a study in 2005 which showed that AMPK directly phosphorylates GEF, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to directly activate MEF2. AICAR treatment has been shown, however, to increase transport of both proteins into the nucleus, as well as increase the binding of both to the GLUT-4 promoter region.

There is another protein involved in carbohydrate metabolism that is worthy of mention along with GLUT-4. The enzyme hexokinase phosphorylates a six-carbon sugar, most notably glucose, which is the first step in glycolysis. When glucose is transported into the cell it is phosphorylated by hexokinase. This phosphorylation keeps glucose from leaving the cell, and by changing the structure of glucose through phosphorylation, it decreases the concentration of glucose molecules, maintaining a gradient for more glucose to be transported into the cell. Hexokinase II transcription is increased in both red and white skeletal muscle upon treatment with AICAR. With chronic injections of AICAR, total protein content of hexokinase II increases in rat skeletal muscle.

=== Mitochondria ===
Mitochondrial enzymes, such as cytochrome c, succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and citrate synthase, increase in expression and activity in response to exercise. AICAR stimulation of AMPK increases cytochrome c and δ-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS), a rate-limiting enzyme involved in the production of heme. Malate dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase also increase, as well as citrate synthase activity, in rats treated with AICAR injections. Conversely, in LKB1 knockout mice, there are decreases in cytochrome c and citrate synthase activity, even if the mice are &quot;trained&quot; by voluntary exercise.

AMPK is required for increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) expression in skeletal muscle in response to creatine depletion. PGC-1α is a transcriptional regulator for genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, gluconeogenesis, and is considered the master regulator for mitochondrial biogenesis.

To do this, it enhances the activity of transcription factors like nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1), myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), host cell factor (HCF), and others. It also has a positive feedback loop, enhancing its own expression. Both MEF2 and cAMP response element (CRE) are essential for contraction-induced PGC-1α promoter activity. LKB1 knockout mice show a decrease in PGC-1α, as well as mitochondrial proteins.

=== Thyroid hormone ===

AMPK and thyroid hormone regulate some similar processes. Knowing these similarities, Winder and Hardie et al. designed an experiment to see if AMPK was influenced by thyroid hormone. They found that all of the subunits of AMPK were increased in skeletal muscle, especially in the soleus and red quadriceps, with thyroid hormone treatment. There was also an increase in phospho-ACC, a marker of AMPK activity.

=== Glucose sensing systems ===

Loss of AMPK has been reported to alter the sensitivity of glucose sensing cells, through poorly defined mechanisms. Loss of the AMPKα2 subunit in pancreatic β-cells and hypothalamic neurons decreases the sensitivity of these cells to changes in extracellular glucose concentration. Moreover, exposure of rats to recurrent bouts of insulin induced hypoglycemia/glucopenia, reduces the activation of AMPK within the hypothalamus, whilst also suppressing the counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia. 
 Pharmacological activation of AMPK by delivery of AMPK activating drug AICAR, directly into the hypothalamus can increase the counterregulatory response to hypoglycaemia.

=== Lysosomal damage, inflammatory diseases, and metformin ===
AMPK is recruited to lysosomes and regulated at the lysosomes via several systems of clinical significance. This includes the AXIN - LKB1 complex, acting in response to glucose limitations functioning independently of AMP sensing, which detects low glucose as absence of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate via a dynamic set of interactions between lysosomally localized V-ATPase-aldolase in contact with the endoplasmic reticulum localized TRPV. A second AMPK-control system localized to lysosomes depends on the Galectin-9-TAK1 system and ubiquitination responses at controlled by deubiquitinating enzymes such as USP9X leading to AMPK activation in response to lysosomal damage, a condition that can occur biochemically, physically via protein aggregates such as proteopathic tau in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, crystalline silica causing silicosis, cholesterol crystals causing inflammation via NLRP3 inflammasome and rupture of atherosclerotic lesions, urate crystals associated with gout, or during microbial invasion such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis or coronaviruses causing SARS. Both of the above lysosomally localized systems controlling AMPK activate it in response to metformin, a widely prescribed anti-diabetic drug.

=== Tumor suppression and promotion ===
Some evidence indicates that AMPK may have a role in tumor suppression. Studies have found that AMPK may exert most, or even all of, the tumor suppressing properties of liver kinase B1 (LKB1). Additionally, studies where the AMPK activator metformin was used to treat diabetes found a correlation with a reduced risk of cancer, compared to other medications. Gene knockout and knockdown studies with mice found that mice without the gene to express AMPK had greater risks of developing lymphomas, though as the gene was knocked out globally instead of just in B cells, it was impossible to conclude that AMP knockout had cell-autonomous effects within tumor progenitor cells.

In contrast, some studies have linked AMPK with a role as a tumor promoter by protecting cancer cells from stress. Thus, once cancerous cells have formed in an organism, AMPK may swap from protecting against cancer to protecting the cancer itself. Studies have found that tumor cells with AMPK knockout are more susceptible to death by glucose starvation or extracellular matrix detachment, which may indicate AMPK has a role in preventing these two outcomes. A recent study on pancreatic cancer suggests that AMPKα may play a role in the metastatic cascade and the phenotype of cancer cells. Mechanistically, the authors propose that in the absence of AMPKα, pancreatic cancer cells are more vulnerable to oxidative stress, supporting a tumor-promoting function of AMPKα. 

== Controversy over role in adaption to exercise/training ==

A seemingly paradoxical role of AMPK occurs when we take a closer look at the energy-sensing enzyme in relation to exercise and long-term training. Similar to short-term acute training scale, long-term endurance training studies also reveal increases in oxidative metabolic enzymes, GLUT-4, mitochondrial size and quantity, and an increased dependency on the oxidation of fatty acids; however, Winder et al. reported in 2002 that despite observing these increased oxidative biochemical adaptations to long-term endurance training (similar to those mentioned above), the AMPK response (activation of AMPK with the onset of exercise) to acute bouts of exercise decreased in red quadriceps (RQ) with training (3 – see Fig.1). Conversely, the study did not observe the same results in white quadriceps (WQ) and soleus (SOL) muscles that they did in RQ. The trained rats used for that endurance study ran on treadmills 5 days/wk in two 1-h sessions, morning and afternoon. The rats were also running up to 31m/min (grade 15%). Finally, following training, the rats were sacrificed either at rest or following 10 minutes of exercise.

Because the AMPK response to exercise decreases with increased training duration, many questions arise that would challenge the AMPK role with respect to biochemical adaptations to exercise and endurance training. This is due in part to the marked increases in the mitochondrial biogenesis, upregulation of GLUT-4, UCP-3, Hexokinase II along with other metabolic and mitochondrial enzymes despite decreases in AMPK activity with training. Questions also arise because skeletal muscle cells which express these decreases in AMPK activity in response to endurance training also seem to be maintaining an oxidative dependent approach to metabolism, which is likewise thought to be regulated to some extent by AMPK activity.

If the AMPK response to exercise is responsible in part for biochemical adaptations to training, how then can these adaptations to training be maintained if the AMPK response to exercise is being attenuated with training? It is hypothesized that these adaptive roles to training are maintained by AMPK activity and that the increases in AMPK activity in response to exercise in trained skeletal muscle have not yet been observed due to biochemical adaptations that the training itself stimulated in the muscle tissue to reduce the metabolic need for AMPK activation. In other words, due to previous adaptations to training, AMPK will not be activated, and further adaptation will not occur, until the intracellular ATP levels become depleted from an even higher intensity energy challenge than prior to those previous adaptations.

<text>Dover Athletic Football Club is a semi-professional association football club based in the town of Dover, Kent, England. The club currently competes in the Isthmian League Premier Division, the seventh tier of the English football league system. The club was formed in 1983 after the dissolution of the town&#x27;s previous club, Dover F.C., whose place in the Southern League was taken by the new club. 

In the 1989–90 season Dover Athletic won the Southern League championship, but failed to gain promotion to the Football Conference as the club&#x27;s ground did not meet the required standard. Three seasons later the team won the title again and this time gained promotion to the Conference, where they spent nine seasons before being relegated at the end of the 2001–02 season. The club was transferred from the Southern League to the Isthmian League in 2004, competing in that league&#x27;s Premier Division for one season before mounting financial problems led the club to a further relegation. In the 2007–08 season, Dover won Division One South of the league, before winning the Premier Division in 2008–09 and thus gaining promotion to the Conference South. They spent five seasons in this division, reaching the play-offs three times, before defeating Ebbsfleet United in the 2013–14 play-off final to finally return to the Conference Premier after a twelve-year absence. At the end of the 2021–22 season Dover were relegated back to the National League South, after finishing the season with one point.

The team usually wear white shirts and are consequently nicknamed the Whites. They have played at the Crabble Athletic Ground since the club&#x27;s formation. The club&#x27;s best performance in the FA Cup was reaching the third round proper in both the 2010–11 and 2014–15 seasons, while the best performance registered in the FA Trophy, the national competition for higher-level non-league clubs, was a run to the semi-finals in the 1997–98 season.

==History==

Dover Athletic F.C. was formed in 1983 after the town&#x27;s previous club, Dover, folded due to its debts. The new club took Dover&#x27;s place in the Southern League Southern Division, with former Dover player Alan Jones as manager and a team consisting mainly of reserve players from the old club. Initially Athletic struggled, finishing second from bottom of the table in the 1984–85 season. In November 1985 Steve McRae, who had succeeded Jones a year earlier, was sacked and replaced by Chris Kinnear.
Under Kinnear the club&#x27;s fortunes turned round, with two top-five finishes followed by the Southern Division championship, and with it promotion, in the 1987–88 season. The team started strongly in the Premier Division, finishing in sixth place at the first attempt, and then winning the championship in the 1989–90 season. The club was denied promotion to the Football Conference, however, as the Crabble Athletic Ground did not meet the standard required for that league. After finishing fourth and second in the subsequent two seasons, Dover won the title again in the 1992–93 season and this time were admitted to the Conference.

Although Dover finished in eighth place in their first season in the Conference, the following season saw the club struggling against relegation, and Kinnear was dismissed due to a combination of the team&#x27;s poor performances and his own personal problems. John Ryan was appointed as the club&#x27;s new manager, but his reign was a short one and he was dismissed when the club lost seven of its first eight matches in the 1995–96 season. The club then appointed former England international Peter Taylor as manager, but he was unable to steer the team away from the foot of the table, and Dover held onto their place in the Conference only because Northern Premier League runners-up Boston United failed to submit their application for promotion before the required deadline.

Bill Williams took over as manager in 1997 and led the club to the FA Trophy semi-finals in the 1997–98 season and a best league finish to date of sixth place in the 1999–2000 season. Williams left the club to take a senior position with Conference rivals Kingstonian in May 2001. By now the club was in severe financial difficulties, with a number of directors resigning and debts exceeding £100,000. Amid the crisis the entire board of directors resigned, forcing the club&#x27;s Supporters&#x27; Trust to take over the running of the club, and manager Gary Bellamy was sacked after just six months in the job. Former Everton goalkeeper Neville Southall took over but was dismissed just three months later, with Clive Walker taking over in March 2002 with the club rooted to the foot of the table. The club finished the season bottom of the Conference and was relegated back to the Southern League Premier Division. The club&#x27;s ongoing financial problems led to it entering a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), a process by which insolvent companies offset their debts against future profits, due to debts that were now estimated at £400,000.
In Dover&#x27;s first season back in the Southern League Premier Division the Whites finished in third place, albeit 17 points adrift of Tamworth, who claimed the one promotion place available that season. A poor start to the following season saw Walker replaced by Richard Langley. Dover finished the season in 19th place, before being switched to the Isthmian League Premier Division in the summer of 2004 following a re-organisation of the English football league system. The new season started with six successive defeats, which saw Langley sacked, and the financial problems continued, with the club coming within two months of being closed down. Dover were relegated to the Isthmian League Division One at the end of the season, but were saved from possible extinction in January 2005 when former director Jim Parmenter returned to head up a consortium that took over the club. Parmenter quickly sacked manager Steve Browne and convinced Clive Walker to return to the club to replace him, and also arranged for the club&#x27;s outstanding CVA debts to be cleared, putting the club on a firm financial footing for the first time in many years.

Dover Athletic narrowly missed out on an immediate return to the Premier Division in the 2005–06 season, reaching the play-offs for promotion but losing out to Tonbridge Angels. The following season Dover again reached the play-offs but lost in the semi-final to Hastings United, after which Walker did not have his contract renewed and was replaced by former Gillingham manager Andy Hessenthaler. In his first season in charge he led the club to the Division One South championship and promotion to the Isthmian League Premier Division. The following season Dover won a second consecutive championship and thus gained promotion to Conference South. In the 2009–10 season, Dover reached the play-offs for promotion to the Conference National, but lost at the semi-final stage to Woking. The following season the club reached the third round of the FA Cup for the first time after wins over Kent rivals Gillingham in the first round and another League Two club, Aldershot Town, in the second round. In the 2012–13 season the club again reached the play-offs, but this time lost in the final to Salisbury City.

During the following season, the team reached the second round of the FA Cup, losing 1–0 to Milton Keynes Dons. They also made the last 16 of the FA Trophy, narrowly losing 3–2 to Eastleigh, and reached the play-offs once more. A 4–1 aggregate victory over Sutton United in the semi-final set up a match with fellow Kent team Ebbsfleet United in the final. On 10 May 2014, Dover beat Ebbsfleet 1–0 at Stonebridge Road with a goal from Nathan Elder, enough to seal the club&#x27;s return to the top flight of non-league football for the first time since 2002. In the 2014–15 season, Dover went on another FA Cup run, beating Morecambe 1–0 in the first round and Cheltenham Town 1–0 in the second, to reach the third round proper for only the second time ever. However, they lost 4–0 at home to Premier League side Crystal Palace. During the following season, the team qualified for the play-offs for promotion to League Two.

During the 2020–21 season, the team only played 15 fixtures, with none played after 30 January 2021, due to staff being furloughed because of the costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the club had all of its results expunged in March and was fined £40,000. In addition, the club was handed a 12-point deduction for the 2021–22 season and fined £40,000 by the National League. , the club had released all but four players, who were reduced from full to part-time. The 2021–22 season saw Dover start with the points deduction and after picking up only eight points in 33 matches, a 2–0 home defeat to Yeovil Town confirmed Dover&#x27;s relegation back to the National League South after eight seasons in the top flight of non-league football. In their second season back in the sixth tier, they were relegated to the Isthmian League, finishing bottom of the table having only won four games all season.

==Colours and crest==
Dover Athletic&#x27;s traditional colours are white and black, which were also the colours worn by the earlier Dover club. Away colours worn by the club have included red, yellow and green, pink, and blue. The club&#x27;s crest contains a stylised representation of the town&#x27;s two most famous landmarks, Dover Castle and the white cliffs, enclosed in a circle bearing the club&#x27;s name. The club&#x27;s shirts have been sponsored by companies including Criccieth Homes, Paul Brown of Dover, Jenkins and Pain, cross-channel ferry operators Hoverspeed and SeaFrance, local car dealership Perry&#x27;s, and Gomez, the company owned by Dover Athletic chairman Jim Parmenter.

==Stadium==
Dover Athletic&#x27;s home ground since the club&#x27;s foundation has been the Crabble Athletic Ground, which was also the home of the former Dover club. The word &quot;Crabble&quot;, which is also found in the name of a local corn mill, may derive from the Old English &quot;crabba hol&quot;, meaning a hole in which crabs are found. The stadium, commonly known simply as &quot;Crabble&quot; or, imprecisely, as &quot;The Crabble&quot;, forms part of a larger council-owned complex, and the earlier Dover club originally shared the lower pitch with a rugby club, but moved to the upper pitch in the 1950s, adding a grandstand in 1951, followed soon after by terracing and floodlights.

Dover Athletic continued to make improvements to the ground, although not in time to allow the club to take its place in the Football Conference in 1990. Subsequently, new turnstiles were installed and two new terraces and a second grandstand added. These improvements meant that the club was able to gain promotion after its second Southern League title in 1993. The stadium&#x27;s modern capacity is 5,745

In 2007 the club announced that under the new sponsorship deal with SeaFrance, the stadium would be known officially as the SeaFrance Crabble Stadium, but a year later it was announced that the deal would not be renewed due to the ferry operator&#x27;s financial constraints. On 1 July 2008 local car dealership Perry&#x27;s was announced as the club&#x27;s new main sponsor and the stadium rebranded as the Perry&#x27;s Crabble Stadium, an arrangement which lasted until 2012. Between 2003 and 2004 it was known as the Hoverspeed Stadium under the terms of another such agreement. Margate played their home matches at Crabble for two seasons from 2002 until 2004, while their own Hartsdown Park ground was being redeveloped. The stadium had further development in 2016, when a new family stand was built.

==Supporters==
In the club&#x27;s early days Athletic struggled to attract crowds of over 150, but by the time the club reached the Conference, crowds at Crabble were averaging around 1,000. After the club&#x27;s relegation to the Isthmian League Division One South, the average attendance fell to just over 800, but when the club returned to the Premier Division for the 2008–09 season, the average attendance at Crabble was 1,293, the highest in the division. The highest home attendance in the club&#x27;s history was 5,645 for the match against Crystal Palace in the third round of the FA Cup on 4 January 2015. Although Athletic&#x27;s improved monetary position means that the Supporters&#x27; Trust is no longer required to financially support the club, it remains active as a fundraising organisation.

==Statistics and records==
Dover Athletic&#x27;s highest finish in the English football league system was in the 2015–16 season, in which the team finished in fifth place in the National League, the highest level of non-League football and the fifth level overall. The Whites have made 13 appearances in the final qualifying round of the FA Cup, but have only progressed to the first round proper three times. In the 2010–11 season, Dover reached the third round for the first time, defeating Football League Two teams Gillingham and Aldershot Town in the first two rounds before losing to Huddersfield Town of Football League One. In the 1997–98 season the Whites reached the semi-finals of the FA Trophy but missed out on an appearance at Wembley, losing to Cheltenham Town. The largest number of points the team has accrued is 104 in the 2008–09 season, and the highest total number of goals scored in a season is 89, scored in 40 matches in the 1985–86 season. The team&#x27;s biggest ever win was an 8–0 defeat of East Preston in September 2009, and the heaviest defeat was by six goals when they lost 7–1 to Poole Town in April 1984 and 6–0 to Grimsby Town in October 2021.

The holder of the record for most appearances for Dover Athletic is Jason Bartlett, who played in 539 matches, and the all-time top goalscorer is Lennie Lee, with 160 goals. The club&#x27;s record signing is Dave Leworthy, who joined the club from Farnborough Town in 1993 for £50,000, which at the time was the highest transfer fee ever paid between non-league clubs. The highest confirmed fee received by the club was also £50,000, paid by Brentford in 1997 for Ricky Reina.

<text>Manderley is a fictional estate in Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s 1938 novel &quot;Rebecca&quot;, owned by the character Maxim de Winter.

Located in Southern England, Manderley is a typical country estate: it is filled with family heirlooms, is run by a large domestic staff and is open to the public on certain days. It is often said to be in Cornwall, as this is where the author lived, and the nearby placenames &quot;Kerrith&quot; and &quot;Lanyon&quot; are Cornish-derived; the film version is explicitly set in Cornwall.

In spite of the house&#x27;s beauty, the main character, the unnamed narrator, who has become mistress of Manderley, senses an atmosphere of doom about it, due to the death of Max&#x27;s first wife (the titular Rebecca), and it is hinted that Rebecca haunts the estate. 

Du Maurier&#x27;s childhood visits to Milton Hall, Cambridgeshire, home of the Fitzwilliam family, influenced the descriptions of Manderley, especially the interior. She told the 10th Earl Fitzwilliam in a letter that when she wrote &quot;Rebecca&quot; 20 years later, the interior of Manderley was based on her recollection of the rooms and &#x27;big house feel&#x27; of Milton in the First World War. The adult du Maurier&#x27;s Cornish home near Fowey, called Menabilly, was influential in her descriptions of the setting, though it was a much smaller house. Seven years after writing the novel, she leased the manor (1945–1967) from the Rashleigh family, who have owned it since the 16th century. Like Menabilly, Manderley could not be seen from the road.

==In popular culture==
*Manderley appears in most film and TV adaptations: the 1940 film by Alfred Hitchcock, the 1997 television series, and the 2020 film by Ben Wheatley.
*As a result of the novel&#x27;s popularity, the name &quot;Manderley&quot; became extremely popular as a name for ordinary houses. The Irish singer Enya renamed her Dublin castle Manderley Castle.
*A &quot;Manderley Castle&quot; features in one of the &quot;Anno Dracula&quot; books by Kim Newman.
*Danish film director Lars von Trier&#x27;s 2005 film &quot;Manderlay&quot; is set in a country estate with a large domestic staff.
*In Stephen King&#x27;s 1998 novel, &quot;Bag of Bones&quot;, &quot;Manderley&quot; is a semi-isolated lake house in Maine, identified with Sara Laughs, in the dreams of the main character Mike Noonan.
*There is a fully functional &quot;Manderley Bar&quot; in the fictional McKittrick Hotel, home to the immersive theater performance of &quot;Sleep No More&quot; in New York City on West 27 Street. The bar is named after the estate from &quot;Rebecca,&quot; and several characters, plots, and themes from the novel appear in the performance.

<doc id="537607" wikidata="Q313917" url="?curid=537607" title="Fromental Halévy">
<text>Jacques-François-Fromental-Élie Halévy, usually known as Fromental Halévy (; 27 May 179917 March 1862), was a French composer. He is known today largely for his opera &quot;La Juive&quot;.

==Early career==
Halévy was born in Paris, son of the cantor Élie Halfon Halévy, who was the secretary of the Jewish community of Paris and a writer and teacher of Hebrew, and a French Jewish mother. The name Fromental (meaning &#x27;oat grass&#x27;), by which he was generally known, reflects his birth on the day dedicated to that plant: 7 Prairial in the French Revolutionary calendar, which was still operative at that time. He entered the Conservatoire de Paris at the age of nine or ten (accounts differ), in 1809, becoming a pupil and later protégé of Cherubini. After two second-place attempts, he won the Prix de Rome in 1819: his cantata subject was &quot;Herminie&quot;.

As he had to delay his departure to Rome because of the death of his mother, he was able to accept the first commission that brought him to public attention: a &quot;Marche Funèbre et De Profundis en Hébreu&quot; for three part choir, tenor and orchestra, which was commissioned by the &quot;Consistoire Israélite du Département de la Seine&quot;, for a public service in memory of the assassinated duc de Berry, performed on 24 March 1820. Later, his brother Léon recalled that the &quot;De Profundis&quot;, &quot;infused with religious fervor, created a sensation, and attracted interest to the young laureate of the institute&quot;.

Halévy was chorus master at the Théâtre Italien, while he struggled to get an opera performed. Despite the mediocre reception of &quot;L&#x27;artisan&quot;, at the Opéra-Comique in 1827, Halévy moved on to be chorus master at the Opéra. The same year he became professor of harmony and accompaniment at the Conservatoire de Paris, where he was professor of counterpoint and fugue in 1833 and of composition in 1840. He had many notable students. 

==&quot;La Juive&quot;==

With his opera &quot;La Juive&quot;, in 1835, Halévy attained not only his first major triumph, but gave the world a work that was to be one of the cornerstones of the French repertory for a century, with the role of Eléazar one of the great favorites of tenors such as Enrico Caruso. The opera&#x27;s most famous aria is Eléazar&#x27;s &quot;Rachel, quand du Seigneur&quot;. Its orchestral ritornello is the one quotation from Halévy that Berlioz included in his &quot;Treatise on Instrumentation&quot;, for its unusual duet for two cors anglais. It is probable, however, that this aria was inserted only at the request of the great tenor Adolphe Nourrit, who premiered the role and may have suggested the aria&#x27;s text. &quot;La Juive&quot; is one of the grandest of grand operas, with major choruses, a spectacular procession in Act I and impressive celebrations in Act III. It culminates with the heroine plunging into a vat of boiling water in Act V. Mahler admired it greatly, stating: &quot;I am absolutely overwhelmed by this wonderful, majestic work. I regard it as one of the greatest operas ever created&quot;. Other admirers included Wagner, who wrote an enthusiastic review of Halévy&#x27;s grand operas for the German press in 1841 (Wagner never showed towards Halévy the anti-Jewish animus that was so notorious a feature of his writings on Meyerbeer and Mendelssohn).

==Later career==
Halévy was elected to the Institut de France in 1836, but after &quot;La Juive&quot;, his real successes were relatively few, although at least three operas, &quot;L&#x27;Éclair&quot;, &quot;La reine de Chypre&quot; and &quot;Charles VI&quot; received some critical and popular acclaim. Heine commented that Halévy was an artist, but &quot;without the slightest spark of genius&quot;. He became, however, a leading bureaucrat of the arts, becoming Secretary of the Académie des Beaux-Arts and presiding over committees to determine the standard pitch of orchestral A, to award prizes for operettas, etc. The artist Eugène Delacroix described Halévy&#x27;s decline in his diaries (5 February 1855):
Halévy&#x27;s cantata &quot;Prométhée enchaîné&quot; was premiered in 1849 at the Paris Conservatoire and is generally considered the first mainstream western orchestral composition to use quarter tones.

Halévy died in retirement at Nice in 1862, aged 62, leaving his last opera &quot;Noé&quot; unfinished. It was completed by his former student Georges Bizet, but was not performed until ten years after Bizet&#x27;s own death.

==Works==
Halévy wrote some forty operas in all, including:

* &quot;L&#x27;Artisan&quot; (1827)
* &quot;Le Roi et le batelier&quot; (1827)
* &quot;Clari&quot; (1828), in Italian; a modest success, even with Maria Malibran in the starring role
* &quot;Le dilettante d&#x27;Avignon&quot; (1829)
* &quot;Attendre et courir&quot; (1830)
* &quot;La Langue musicale&quot; (1830)
* &quot;La tentation&quot; (1832)
* &quot;Les Souvenirs de Lafleur&quot; (1833)
* &quot;Ludovic&quot; (1833), completion of an opera left unfinished by Hérold
* &quot;La Juive&quot; (1835), his first success
* &quot;L&#x27;éclair&quot; (1835), also a great success, in the same season
* &quot;Guido et Ginevra&quot; (1838)
* &quot;Les Treize&quot; (1839)
* &quot;Le shérif&quot; (1839), which Hector Berlioz referred to as a &quot;delightful comic opera&quot;
* &quot;Le Drapier&quot; (1839)
* &quot;Le Guitarréro&quot; (1841)
* &quot;La reine de Chypre&quot; (1841), praised by Richard Wagner
* &quot;Charles VI&quot; (1843), revived at Compiègne in 2005
* &quot;Le lazzarone, ou Le bien vient en dormant&quot; (1844)
* &quot;Les Mousquetaires de la reine&quot; (1846)
* &quot;Les Premiers pas&quot; (1847)
* &quot;Le val d&#x27;Andorre&quot; (1848)
* &quot;La Fée aux roses&quot; (1849)
* &quot;La Tempesta&quot; (1850), in Italian, after Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;
* &quot;La Dame de pique&quot; (1850), not after Prosper Mérimée&#x27;s adaptation of Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s novella
* &quot;Le Juif errant&quot; (1852), after the novel by Eugène Sue
* &quot;Le nabab&quot; (1853)
* &quot;Jaguarita l&#x27;Indienne&quot; (1855)
* &quot;L&#x27;Inconsolable&quot; (1855)
* &quot;Valentine d&#x27;Aubigny&quot; (1856)
* &quot;La magicienne&quot; (1858)
* &quot;Noé&quot; (1858–1862), uncompleted at Halévy&#x27;s death, completed by Georges Bizet

Halévy also wrote for the ballet, provided incidental music for a French version of Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, and wrote cantatas.

==Halévy&#x27;s family==
Halévy&#x27;s wife, Léonie (sister of Eugénie Foa) who had experienced serious mental problems during their marriage, underwent a remarkable recovery after his death and became a talented sculptor (she was 20 years younger than he.) In 1869, their daughter Geneviève married the composer Georges Bizet, who had been one of Halévy&#x27;s pupils at the Conservatoire. After Bizet&#x27;s death and an alliance with Élie-Miriam Delaborde, the son of Charles-Valentin Alkan, Geneviève married a banker with Rothschild connections and became a leading Parisian salonnière. Amongst the guests at her soirées was the young Marcel Proust, who used her as one of the models for the Duchesse de Guermantes in his epic &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;.

Halévy&#x27;s brother was the writer and historian Léon Halévy, who wrote an early biography of his brother and was the father of Ludovic Halévy, librettist of many French operas, including Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; and Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot;. Léon was also the father, by his mistress Lucinde Paradol, of the politician Lucien-Anatole Prévost-Paradol.

<text>The University of Maryland Global Campus (UMGC) is a public university in Adelphi, Maryland. It is the largest institution in the University System of Maryland. Established in 1947 as the College of Special and Continuation Studies of the University of Maryland, College Park, for mid-career working professionals and non-traditional students, UMGC offers online, hybrid, and face-to-face instruction at education centers across the Washington–Baltimore metropolitan area, throughout Maryland, and around the world.

UMGC is open to all applicants for undergraduate and graduate programs. It is also among the top 10 recipients of the federal G.I. Bill benefits. The university offers 135 academic programs in online, hybrid and face-to-face classes, including bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees, as well as undergraduate and graduate certificates. UMGC is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.

==History==
 UMGC is an outgrowth of the evening program for adults at the University of Maryland, which began in the 1920s. In 1947, the College of Special and Continuation Studies (CSCS) was established. In 1959, The CSCS became the University of Maryland University College (UMUC). In 1970, UMUC became an independent institution, and was a founding member of the University System of Maryland in 1988.

UMUC formerly had an international campus in Schwäbisch Gmünd, Germany, until 2002. It also ran a two-year residential campus in Munich, from 1950 to 1992, which then moved to Augsburg, from 1993 to 1994, and then to Mannheim, in 1995 until it finally closed in 2005. The residential campus offered a two-year associate degree and mainly served high school graduate children of U.S. military and government personnel stationed in Europe.

In 2023, UMGC has more than 175 classroom and service locations on military installations and other education centers throughout the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, as well as in Asia. In 2004, UMUC shared the ICDE Prize of Excellence from the International Council for Open and Distance Education.

===University name===

Known as University of Maryland University College up until 2019, it was a college in the traditional American sense of the word, albeit one associated with a university—hence , &quot;University College.&quot; The &quot;University of Maryland&quot; prefix indicated the historical entity to which the college belonged originally. In the university&#x27;s name, &quot;University College&quot; represented &quot;the specialized concentration on professional development,&quot; while &quot;University of Maryland&quot; represented the affiliation of the university with the University System of Maryland.

When UMUC first opened in 1947, the school was named College of Special and Continuation Studies within the University of Maryland, College Park. In 1953, Raymond Ehrensberger, chancellor of the institution at that time, wanted to change the name to something more meaningful and less cumbersome for people to say and remember. Early suggestions for the name included College of General Studies, College of Adult Education and University College.

In 1959, Chancellor Ehrensberger persuaded the University of Maryland&#x27;s Board of Regents to change the name to University of Maryland University College. The name &quot;University College&quot; was adopted from the British university system to depict an educational institution offering &quot;courses and programs from all academic departments outside the university&#x27;s walls and normal class times.&quot; Therefore, UMUC was not a division of the University of Maryland, College Park, but rather a separate institution within the University System of Maryland.

In 2019, the university announced that its name would change to &quot;University of Maryland Global Campus.&quot; The name change request was submitted as SB 201 and HB 319 in the 2019 regular session of the Maryland General Assembly. The name change was enacted into law on April 18, 2019 when the bill was signed by Maryland Governor Larry Hogan.

==Academics==
UMGC is one of the largest online public universities in the United States. Courses are delivered in online, hybrid and face-to-face formats. Even before the advent of online education by way of the World Wide Web, UMGC was a distance education pioneer and offered distance learning using its WebTycho interface by way of dial-up access. UMGC later adopted the use of the Web for connectivity to its online classrooms, as well as using television and correspondence courses to deliver course content.

The university has three schools:
* School of Integrative and Professional Studies
* School of Business
* School of Cybersecurity and Information Technology

UMGC offers more than 30 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs and undergraduate certificates, awarded in cybersecurity, biotechnology, business management, computers/information technology, communications, criminal justice/legal studies, and social sciences. Undergraduate students can earn credit through coursework and prior-learning programs, which recognize professional and workplace experience, including military service.

UMGC offers more than 55 master&#x27;s degree programs, graduate certificates, and doctoral degrees. Most graduate programs are available in online and hybrid formats.

===U.S. military locations===
UMGC offers face-to-face courses and support for students at U.S. military locations in Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Kuwait, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Australia, Guam, Japan, Okinawa, Singapore, South Korea, Diego Garcia, Spain, and Italy.

==Campuses==

===Headquarters/main campus===

The headquarters for UMGC is located in Adelphi, Maryland near the campus of the University of Maryland, College Park. Until late 2000, the UMGC headquarters was listed in College Park, Maryland. In an attempt to establish its own identity as an independent university, UMGC changed its postal address to Adelphi, an unincorporated community that borders College Park. The address change with the U.S. Postal Service involved no physical move of people and facilities. The marketing decision to change its postal address was one of many undertaken by UMGC to distinguish the university as one of the largest distance-education centers, with over 248,000 students enrolled worldwide in FY 2015.

===UMGC Headquarters===
UMGC retrofitted its headquarters in Adelphi, Md, to meet &quot;green&quot; building requirements for LEED certification. UMGC followed the same process as it did to achieve LEED certification in 2005 for its Inn &amp; Conference Center, which became the first hotel complex in the United States to achieve certification as a green building.

====Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area====
In the greater Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area, classes are held at 20 locations, including on the campus of University of Maryland, College Park. The satellite campuses offer varying academic services, including advising and computer labs.

UMGC operates a facility in Dorsey Station (Md) adjacent to the Dorsey MARC Train Station. In partnership with Maryland community colleges and other University System of Maryland institutions, UMGC offers courses and degree programs at several higher education centers throughout the state. It also offers classes and advising services at the College of Southern Maryland. A consortium of universities led by Anne Arundel Community College, including UMGC, operates a higher education center adjacent to Arundel Mills mall in Hanover, Maryland. In addition, the University offers courses at the Universities at Shady Grove and University System of Maryland at Hagerstown, which are part of the University System of Maryland.

====Global locations====
In Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, UMGC offers courses on military bases for service members, contractors, Federal employees, and their families. In addition to distance learning via the Web, the university offers on-site, instructor-led classes and/or services at 175 overseas US military bases in 20 countries throughout the world. Overseas instruction is coordinated through its Europe Division, which covers USCENTCOM installations in the Middle East, and Asia Division. UMGC divisional headquarters are located in Kaiserslautern, Germany (following the closure of United States Army Garrison Heidelberg) and on Yokota Air Base, Tokyo, Japan, respectively.

==Students==
UMGC specializes in distance learning for adult, non-traditional students in Maryland, across the country, and around the world by operating education centers and offering online instruction. In FY 2023, the university enrolled almost 53,000 military-affiliated students from around the world. In FY 2023, more than 32,000 Marylanders attended UMGC.

About three-quarters of the undergraduate students attend part-time. Over ninety-two percent of UMGC students are employed full-time. The majority of undergraduate students are female. The median age of stateside undergraduate students is 31. Almost two-thirds of the graduate MBA students are married, half are female, and over a third are minorities. Over a third of UMGC&#x27;s stateside students were African-American, and this minority group earned over a third of the degrees awarded by the university.

==Rankings and awards==
UMGC was ranked #1 in &quot;The Military Times&quot; “Best for Vets: Colleges 2015” list of top online and nontraditional schools in 2015. &quot;Military Times&quot; “Best for Vets” is one of the most respected and comprehensive rankings for veterans who are considering higher education. The publication looked at U.S. Department of Education statistics on student success and academic quality, as well as areas such as university culture, student support, and academic policies in evaluating hundreds of schools.

&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked UMGC #131-171 in Regional Universities North for its 2022 edition of Best Colleges.

<doc id="537615" wikidata="Q1086635" url="?curid=537615" title="Saint Louis Blues (song)">
<text>&quot;The Saint Louis Blues&quot; (or &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot;) is a popular American song composed by W. C. Handy in the blues style and published in September 1914. It was one of the first blues songs to succeed as a pop song and remains a fundamental part of jazz musicians&#x27; repertoire. Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway, Bing Crosby, Bessie Smith, Billy &quot;Uke&quot; Carpenter, Eartha Kitt, Count Basie, Glenn Miller, Guy Lombardo, Peanuts Hucko, Art Tatum, Paul Robeson, and the Boston Pops Orchestra (under the directions of both Arthur Fiedler and Keith Lockhart) are among the artists who have recorded it. The song has been called &quot;the jazzman&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;&quot;. Composer William Grant Still arranged a version of the song in 1916 while working with Handy.

The 1925 version sung by Bessie Smith, with Louis Armstrong on cornet, was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1993. The 1929 version by Louis Armstrong &amp; His Orchestra (with Red Allen) was inducted in 2008. The 1922 version by W.C. Handy and his Memphis Blues Band was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry in 2023.

==History==

Handy said he had been inspired by a chance meeting with a woman on the streets of St. Louis, Missouri, distraught over her husband&#x27;s absence, who lamented, &quot;Ma man&#x27;s got a heart like a rock cast in de sea&quot;, a key line of the song. Handy&#x27;s autobiography recounts his hearing the tune in St. Louis in 1892: &quot;It had numerous one-line verses and they would sing it all night.&quot;
==Analysis==
The form is unusual in that the verses are the now-familiar standard twelve-bar blues in common time with three lines of lyrics, the first two lines repeated, but it also has a 16-bar bridge written in the habanera rhythm, which Jelly Roll Morton called the &quot;Spanish tinge&quot; and characterized by Handy as tango.

While blues often became simple and repetitive in form, &quot;Saint Louis Blues&quot; has multiple complementary and contrasting strains, similar to classic ragtime compositions. Handy said his objective in writing the song was &quot;to combine ragtime syncopation with a real melody in the spiritual tradition.&quot; T-Bone Walker commented about the song, &quot;You can&#x27;t dress up the blues... I&#x27;m not saying that &#x27;Saint Louis Blues&#x27; isn&#x27;t fine music you understand. But it just isn&#x27;t blues&quot;.

==Performances==
Handy wrote about the first time &quot;Saint Louis Blues&quot; was played in 1914:
Singer and actress Ethel Waters was the first woman to sing &quot;Saint Louis Blues&quot; in public. She said she learned it from Charles Anderson and featured it herself during a 1917 engagement in Baltimore. The film &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot;, from 1929, featured Bessie Smith singing the song.

In 1998, &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot; was included on the album &quot;Gershwin&#x27;s World&quot; by Herbie Hancock which featured Stevie Wonder on vocals. In 1999 at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards, this recording won two Grammys. Stevie Wonder won the Grammy for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance. In the Composing and Arranging category, Herbie Hancock, Robert Sadin and Stevie Wonder, arrangers (Herbie Hancock) won the Grammy for Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocal(s).

In an NPR article dated August 10, 2011 titled &quot;Evolution Of A Song: &#x27;St. Louis Blues&#x27;&quot; by Simon Rentner, the Gershwin - W.C. Handy connection is explained. &quot;Composer George Gershwin borrowed W.C. Handy&#x27;s themes for his own music, including for &quot;Rhapsody in Blue,&quot; Gershwin&#x27;s landmark work. Although the two musicians didn&#x27;t know each other, Gershwin gave Handy a signed copy of his famous score with a note thanking Handy and acknowledging that his &quot;early &#x27;blues&#x27; songs are the forefathers of this work.&quot; Herbie Hancock and Stevie Wonder pay homage to Gershwin&#x27;s admiration of Handy here&quot; on Hancock&#x27;s album, &quot;Gershwin&#x27;s World&quot;.

<text>The Opéra-Comique () is a Paris opera company which was founded around 1714 by some of the popular theatres of the Parisian fairs. In 1762 the company was merged with – and for a time took the name of – its chief rival, the [[Comédie-Italienne]] at the Hôtel de Bourgogne. It was also called the Théâtre-Italien up to about 1793, when it again became most commonly known as the Opéra-Comique. Today the company&#x27;s official name is Théâtre national de l&#x27;Opéra-Comique, and its theatre, with a capacity of around 1,248 seats, sometimes referred to as the Salle Favart (the third on this site), is located at Place Boïeldieu in the 2nd arrondissement of Paris, not far from the Palais Garnier, one of the theatres of the Paris Opéra. The musicians and others associated with the Opéra-Comique have made important contributions to operatic history and tradition in France and to French opera. Its current mission is to reconnect with its history and discover its unique repertoire to ensure production and dissemination of operas for the wider public. Mainstays of the repertory at the Opéra-Comique during its history have included the following works which have each been performed more than 1,000 times by the company: &quot;Cavalleria Rusticana&quot;, &quot;Le chalet&quot;, &quot;La dame blanche&quot;, &quot;Le domino noir&quot;, &quot;La fille du régiment&quot;, &quot;Lakmé&quot;, &quot;Manon&quot;, &quot;Mignon&quot;, &quot;Les noces de Jeannette&quot;, &quot;Le pré aux clercs&quot;, &quot;Tosca&quot;, &quot;La bohème&quot;, &quot;Werther&quot; and &quot;Carmen&quot;, the last having been performed more than 2,500 times.

==Origins==

Since the Middle Ages popular light theatrical entertainments had been a part of the seasonal Parisian fairs, especially the Foire Saint-Germain and the Foire Saint-Laurent. They included farces, tightrope acts, acrobatics, and marionettes, and also included music, such as &quot;vaudevilles&quot; and popular songs. The audiences were diverse, from all levels of society, and the presentations were given on makeshift stages. However, with the establishment in 1672 of King Louis XIV&#x27;s Académie royale de Musique (popularly known as the Opéra) under Jean-Baptiste Lully, the use of music by fair troupes was significantly curtailed.

When the Italian players at the Hôtel de Bourgogne were banished from Paris in 1697 for performing their comedy &quot;La fausse prude&quot; (&quot;The False Prude&quot;), which satirized the King&#x27;s wife, Madame de Maintenon, the fair theatres were quick to adopt much of the Italians&#x27; repertory, which included parodies of operas and tragedies. The fair theatres were soon viewed as competition by the Opéra and the Comédie-Française, and restrictions were again more strictly enforced. The troupes at the Foire Saint-Germain and the Foire Saint-Laurent received warnings from the police in 1699 and 1706. Although in 1708 the fairground entrepreneurs Charles Alard and Maurice were able to purchase from the Opéra&#x27;s director Pierre Guyenet the right to use singers, dancers, musicians, and sets, this did not last as Guyenet died in 1712, leaving the Opéra with a debt in the neighborhood of 400,000 livres. Alard resorted to giving silent performances with the actors&#x27; speeches displayed to the audience on large cue cards. The players next tried including vaudeville airs via audience participation: the musicians would play a popular tune, and the spectators would sing, while the actors remained silent. This was further enhanced when the words began to be displayed to the audience on a large banner.

==Foundation and early history==

In 1713 and 1714 several of the fair troupes were able to conclude a new series of agreements with the creditors of the deceased Guyenet, who at this point had become the managers of the rather expensive Opéra. For an annual fee the troupes obtained the right to perform light comedies interspersed with songs and dances and to use sets and theatre machines. They were also given the right to use the name &quot;Opéra-Comique&quot;. The first work officially given that designation was &quot;Télémaque&quot; (a parody of the opera by André Cardinal Destouches), which was first performed by the Théâtre de la Foire Saint-Germain in 1715. The words were by Alain-René Lesage, the music was arranged by Jean-Claude Gillier, and the orchestra consisted of 15 players. Lesage authored many of the early &quot;opéras comiques&quot;, and composers like Gillier worked primarily as arrangers of existing music. In 1716 one of the troupes&#x27; leaders, Catherine Vanderberg purchased additional rights and began to present more original works by authors, such as Jacques-Philippe d&#x27;Orneval, Alexis Piron, and Louis Fuzelier. In these early days the role of librettist for the theatre was more important than that of the composer – and pre-eminent among them for more than forty years was Charles-Simon Favart, who made his first contribution in 1734 and achieved his first important success with &quot;La chercheuse d&#x27;esprit&quot; in 1741.

In 1743 the impresario Jean Monnet paid 12,000 livres to the Opéra for the right to run the Opéra-Comique, He renovated the theatre and brought together a group of highly talented creative artists, including, besides Favart, who also worked as a stage director, the comedian Préville, the stage designer François Boucher, and the ballet master Dupré and his pupil Jean-Georges Noverre. Jean-Philippe Rameau may also have been the leader of the orchestra. The company was, however, too successful, and the Opéra refused to renew Monnet&#x27;s privilege in 1745. After working briefly in Lyon, and mounting unsuccessful productions in Dijon (1746) and London (1749), he was able to repurchase the Opéra-Comique &quot;privilège&quot; in December 1751 and remained its director until 1757.
During his second period as director, Monnet continued to work with Favart and Noverre, and Boucher designed and built a substantial new theatre for the company of the Foire Saint-Laurent in 1752. The theatre was later installed in a wing of the Hôtel des Menus-Plaisirs on the rue Bergère, where it was used by the Opéra in 1781, and then as the first concert hall of the Paris Conservatory, which was founded on the same site in 1795. The new theatre was especially important, as it enabled the company to perform at times when the fair was not in operation. Monnet&#x27;s friend Jean-Joseph Vadé wrote the libretto for &quot;Les troqueurs&quot;, first staged in July 1753 and advertised as a translation of an Italian work. The music was actually original, composed by Antoine Dauvergne, and began a period of new works in a more Italian style in which music played a much more significant role. Composers for the company during this period included Egidio Duni, François-André Danican Philidor and Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny.

The dramatist Michel-Jean Sedaine wrote the text of his first opera for the company, &quot;Le diable à quatre&quot;, in 1756. It premiered at the Fair Saint-Laurent on 19 August with verses for the &quot;ariettes&quot; provided by Pierre Baurans and with music parodying a variety of composers including Vincenzo Legrenzio Ciampi, Duni, Baldassare Galuppi, and Giuseppe Scarlatti, and also included music attributed to the French composers Jean-Louis Laurette and Philidor. Christoph Willibald Gluck was later to compose his own music for the work. His version was first given in Laxenburg, Austria, on 28 May 1759. Other settings were later composed for the Opéra-Comique by Bernardo Porta (14 February 1790) and Jean-Pierre Solié (30 November 1809).

==1762 to 1807==
On 3 February 1762 the Opéra-Comique was merged into the Comédie-Italienne and occupied the Hôtel de Bourgogne, gaining in respectability what it lost in independence. The company was renamed to Opéra-Comique by an edict of the king in 1780, although the names Comédie-Italienne and Théâtre Italien were still used frequently by the press and public for many years thereafter. In 1783 the company moved again, into the Salle Favart (architect Jean-François Heurtier; ca. 1,100 seats) on the site where the current theatre stands. Around that time the works of Grétry featured strongly.

With the proliferation of opera houses after the Law of 1791 which removed restrictions on the opening of theatres, there was competition with the Théâtre Feydeau, which was resolved in 1801 by merger. By 1807 Napoleon had reduced theatrical freedoms, and the Opéra-Comique was named one of four primary theatres in Paris.

==The 19th century==
French &quot;opéra comique&quot;, in the 19th century at least, was not necessarily &quot;comic&quot; either in the classical sense of ending happily or the modern one of being funny; the term covered a much wider category of work. Notable composers in the history of the Opéra-Comique include Auber, Halévy, Berlioz and Bizet. After Rossini&#x27;s arrival in Paris, new works at the Opéra-Comique took in Italian vocal style and techniques, leading to greater virtuosity, although &quot;the repertory as a whole stood as a bulwark against the italianate invasion of Rossini&quot;.

In 1840, the Opéra-Comique company settled in the second Salle Favart (architect Louis Charpentier; 1,500 seats), built on the site of the first theatre, destroyed by fire in 1838. The new house was inaugurated with a revival of Hérold&#x27;s &quot;Le Pré aux clercs&quot;. During the 1850s and 1860s the Théâtre Lyrique offered competition in the type of repertoire staged, being particularly strong in its policy of new commissions.

Performances took place on most evenings of the week except for major festivals. Boxes could be hired for a year at a time, and many subscribers were wealthy. Before 1848 a third of subscribers were of the aristocracy, but after then it became an especially middle class theatre. After 1848 Émile Perrin sought to revive the repertoire with more literary and ambitious works. Until 1864 its repertoire was still prescribed, by statute, to have spoken dialogue between musical numbers.

The Opéra-Comique staged the first performances of such important French works as Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;The Damnation of Faust&quot; (1846), Thomas&#x27; &quot;Mignon&quot; (1866), and Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; (1875). In the latter part of the century the theatre revived works it had made its own, restaged works from the repertoire of the Théâtre Lyrique (which had closed in 1872) and premiered new pieces, such as Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;Les Contes d&#x27;Hoffmann&quot; (1881); Delibes&#x27; &quot;Lakmé&quot; (1883); Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Manon&quot; (1884), &quot;Esclarmonde&quot; (1889), and &quot;Werther&quot; (French premiere in 1893); and Charpentier&#x27;s &quot;Louise&quot; (1900).

A fire at the Salle Favart on 25 May 1887 resulted in the death of 84 people by asphyxiation. The building was destroyed and the director Léon Carvalho was forced to resign, although later he was acquitted of blame and resumed the helm at the company from 1891 to 1897. The third Salle Favart (architect Louis Bernier) was officially opened in the presence of President Félix Faure on 7 December 1898.

==The 20th century and beyond==
As the differences between opéra and opéra comique faded, the two main houses in Paris came more into competition, although the Salle Favart saw the premieres of more innovative works: Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; (1902), Dukas&#x27; &quot;Ariane et Barbe-bleue&quot; (1907), Ravel&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;heure espagnole&quot; (1911), and French premieres of works by Puccini and Falla. Between 1900 and 1950, 401 works by 206 different composers were performed at the Opéra-Comique, of which 222 were either world premieres (136) or the first performance in Paris (86).

In June 1936 a broadcast of &quot;Les Contes d&#x27;Hoffmann&quot; was disrupted by the start of a company sit-in demanding the director&#x27;s resignation. In 1939 financial problems resulted in the Opéra-Comique being merged with the Opéra to become the &#x27;Réunion des Théatres Lyriques Nationaux&#x27;. Notable premieres during this period included Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;Les Mamelles de Tiresias&quot; (1947) and &quot;La Voix humaine&quot; (1959). However, by the end of the Second World War, the Opéra-Comique&#x27;s best artists, assets and repertory had been gradually taken from it to enrich the Opéra.

The Opéra-Comique discovered some fresh energy in 1950s, restaging &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot;, &quot;Orphée et Eurydice&quot;, &quot;Le roi malgré lui&quot; and &quot;Les noces de Jeannette&quot; and introducing &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot;, Landowski&#x27;s &quot;Les Adieux&quot; and Dallapiccola&#x27;s &quot;Volo di Notte&quot; to attract new audiences and keep the attention of the arts establishment. At the start of the 1960s Stéphane Wolff, claimed that the theatre could regain its independence: &quot;well-managed, it could again become what it was for so long, the most active and therefore the leading lyric stage in France&quot;. However, in 1972 the Opéra-Comique company was closed (although the theatre itself received visiting productions) and its government grant added to that of the Opéra.

Although the company of the Opéra-Comique was disbanded (followed 20 years later by the closure of the opéra comique classes at the Paris Conservatoire), from 1978 works were staged again at the theatre, both from its traditional repertoire (&quot;Le médecin malgré lui&quot; and &quot;Werther&quot;) as well as more adventurous repertoire: &quot;La chatte anglaise&quot; in 1984, Denisov&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Écume des Jours&quot;, as well as productions with international stars, including Jessye Norman as &quot;Dido&quot; in 1984. While still battling for survival the theatre hosted one of the major baroque revivals: &quot;Atys&quot;, with Les Arts Florissants in 1987. The company regained its autonomy and returned, albeit with an inadequate budget, to the Salle Favart in 1990. Although its budget amounted to less than most provincial French opera houses, the first new director of the independent Opéra-Comique, Thierry Fouquet, attempted to run a balanced programme but handed over in 1994 to Pierre Médecin, who was responsible for the centenary season in 1998 with a new production of &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;. The loss of private sponsors led to a policy of musical comedy and operetta under Jérôme Savary from 2000. A decree of November 2004 put the theatre on a new basis, stressing the variety of productions it should mount: &quot;de l&#x27;opéra baroque à la création contemporaine et le patrimoine de l&#x27;Opéra-Comique&quot;.

It currently mounts 7 or 8 operas or opéra comiques (some of them co-productions), with complementary concerts, recitals and exhibitions, each season. In common with many other opera houses the Opéra-Comique also offers relayed performances to cinemas (around France and in Europe); &quot;Carmen&quot; in June 2009 and &quot;Béatrice et Bénédict&quot; in March 2010.
In 2013 an opera critic was moved to write that of Paris lyric theatres &quot;over the past seven seasons, [the Opéra-Comique] has best succeeded in establishing a particular identity and achieving consistent quality in its productions&quot;.

In the summer of 2015 the theatre closed for 18 months for major refurbishment including the costume department, the salle Bizet, and the hall Boieldieu. During the closure a webopera and a fan zone at the UEFA Cup where spectators were invited to sing well-known opéra-comique songs took place. After the works, the theatre reopened in 2017, with the first stage production since the composer&#x27;s death of Marais&#x27;s &quot;Alcione&quot; (on 25 April 2017) with Jordi Savall conducting Le Concert des Nations.

<text>In philosophy, an ethical dilemma, also called an ethical paradox or moral dilemma, is a situation in which two or more conflicting moral imperatives, none of which overrides the other, confront an agent. A closely related definition characterizes an ethical dilemma as a situation in which every available choice is wrong. The term is also used in a &quot;wider sense&quot; in everyday language to refer to ethical conflicts that may be resolvable, to psychologically difficult choices or to other types of difficult ethical problems.

This article concerns ethical dilemmas in the &quot;strict philosophical sense&quot;, often referred to as &quot;genuine ethical dilemmas&quot;. Various examples have been proposed but there is disagreement as to whether these constitute &quot;genuine&quot; or &quot;merely apparent&quot; ethical dilemmas. The central debate around ethical dilemmas concerns the question of whether there are any. Defenders often point to apparent examples while their opponents usually aim to show their existence contradicts very fundamental ethical principles. Ethical dilemmas come in various types. An important distinction concerns the difference between &quot;epistemic dilemmas&quot;, which give a possibly false impression to the agent of an unresolvable conflict, and actual or &quot;ontological dilemmas&quot;. There is broad agreement that there are epistemic dilemmas but the main interest in ethical dilemmas takes place on the ontological level. Traditionally, philosophers held that it is a requirement for good moral theories to be free from ethical dilemmas. But this assumption has been questioned in contemporary philosophy.

== Definition ==
A person is in an ethical dilemma if they stand under several conflicting moral obligations and no obligation overrides the others. Two ethical requirements are &quot;conflicting&quot; if the agent can do one or the other but not both: the agent has to choose one over the other. Two conflicting ethical requirements do not &quot;override&quot; each other if they have the same strength or if there is no sufficient ethical reason to choose one over the other. Only this type of situation constitutes an ethical dilemma in the strict philosophical sense, often referred to as a &quot;genuine ethical dilemma&quot;. Other cases of ethical conflicts are resolvable and are therefore not ethical dilemmas strictly speaking. This applies to many instances of conflict of interest as well. For example, a businessman hurrying along the shore of a lake to a meeting is in an ethical conflict when he spots a drowning child close to the shore. But this conflict is not a genuine ethical dilemma since it has a clear resolution: jumping into the water to save the child significantly outweighs the importance of making it to the meeting on time. Also excluded from this definition are cases in which it is merely psychologically difficult for the agent to make a choice, for example, because of personal attachments or because the knowledge of the consequences of the different alternatives is lacking.

Ethical dilemmas are sometimes defined not in terms of conflicting obligations but in terms of not having a right course of action, of all alternatives being wrong. The two definitions are equivalent for many but not all purposes. For example, it is possible to hold that in cases of ethical dilemmas, the agent is free to choose either course of action, that either alternative is right. Such a situation still constitutes an ethical dilemma according to the first definition, since the conflicting requirements are unresolved, but not according to the second definition, since there is a right course of action.

== Examples ==
Various examples of ethical dilemmas have been proposed but there is disagreement as to whether these constitute genuine or merely apparent ethical dilemmas. One of the oldest examples is due to Plato, who sketches a situation in which the agent has promised to return a weapon to a friend, who is likely to use it to harm someone since he is not in his right mind. In this example, the duty to keep a promise stands in conflict with the duty to prevent that others are harmed. It is questionable whether this case constitutes a genuine ethical dilemma since the duty to prevent harms seems to clearly outweigh the promise. Another well-known example comes from Jean-Paul Sartre, who describes the situation of one of his students during the German occupation of France. This student faced the choice of either fighting to liberate his country from the Germans or staying with and caring for his mother, for whom he was the only consolation left after the death of her other son. The conflict, in this case, is between a personal duty to his mother and the duty to his country. The novel Sophie&#x27;s Choice by William Styron presents one more widely discussed example. In it, a Nazi guard forces Sophie to choose one of her children to be executed, adding that both will be executed if she refuses to choose. This case is different from the other examples in which the conflicting duties are of different types. This type of case has been labeled &quot;symmetrical&quot; since the two duties have the same type. 

== Types ==
Ethical dilemmas come in different types. The distinctions between these types are often important for disagreements about whether there are ethical dilemmas or not. Certain arguments for or against their existence may apply only to some types but not to other types. And only some types, if any, may constitute genuine ethical dilemmas.

===Epistemic vs ontological===
In &quot;epistemic ethical dilemmas&quot;, it is not clear to the agent what should be done because the agent is unable to discern which moral requirement takes precedence. Many decisions in everyday life, from a trivial choice between differently packaged cans of beans in the supermarket to life-altering career-choices, involve this form of uncertainty. But unresolvable conflicts on the epistemic level can exist without there actually being unresolvable conflicts and vice versa.

The main interest in ethical dilemmas is concerned with on the &quot;ontological level&quot;: whether there actually are genuine dilemmas in the form of unresolvable conflicts between moral requirements, not just whether the agent believes so. The ontological level is also where most of the theoretical disagreements happen since both proponents and opponents of ethical dilemmas usually agree that there are epistemic ethical dilemmas. This distinction is sometimes used to argue against the existence of ethical dilemmas by claiming that all apparent examples are in truth epistemic in nature. In some cases, this can be shown by how the conflict is resolved once the relevant information is obtained. But there may be other cases in which the agent is unable to acquire information that would settle the issue, sometimes referred to as &quot;stable&quot; epistemic ethical dilemmas.

===Self-imposed vs world-imposed===
The difference between &quot;self-imposed&quot; and &quot;world-imposed&quot; ethical dilemmas concerns the source of the conflicting requirements. In the self-imposed case, the agent is responsible for the conflict. A common example in this category is making two incompatible promises, for example, to attend two events happening at distant places at the same time. In the world-imposed case, on the other hand, the agent is thrown into the dilemma without being responsible for it occurring. The difference between these two types is relevant for moral theories. Traditionally, most philosophers held that ethical theories should be free from ethical dilemmas, that moral theories that allow or entail the existence of ethical dilemmas are flawed. In the weak sense, this prohibition is only directed at the world-imposed dilemmas. This means that all dilemmas are avoided by agents who strictly follow the moral theory in question. Only agents who diverge from the theory&#x27;s recommendations may find themselves in ethical dilemmas. But some philosophers have argued that this requirement is too weak, that the moral theory should be able to provide guidance in any situation. This line of thought follows the intuition that it is not relevant how the situation came about for how to respond to it. So e.g. if the agent finds themselves in the self-imposed ethical dilemma of having to choose which promise to break, there should be some considerations why it is right to break one promise rather than the other. Utilitarians, for example, could argue that this depends on which broken promise results in the least harm to all concerned.

===Obligation vs prohibition===
An &quot;obligation&quot; is an ethical requirement to act in a certain way while a &quot;prohibition&quot; is an ethical requirement to not act in a certain way. Most discussions of ethical dilemmas focus on obligation dilemmas: they involve two conflicting actions that the agent is ethically required to perform. Prohibition dilemmas, on the other hand, are situations in which no course of action is allowed. It has been argued that many arguments against ethical dilemmas are only successful in regard to obligation dilemmas but not against prohibition dilemmas.

===Single-agent vs multi-agent===
Ethical dilemmas involve two courses of action that are both obligatory but stand in conflict with each other: it is not possible to perform both actions. In regular &quot;single-agent&quot; cases, a single agent has both conflicting obligations. In &quot;multi-agent&quot; cases, the actions are still incompatible but the obligations concern different people. For example, two contestants engaged in a competition may have both the duty to win if that is what they promised to their families. These two obligations belonging to different people are conflicting since there can be only one winner.

===Other types===
Ethical dilemmas can be divided according to the types of obligations that are in conflict with each other. For example, Rushworth Kidder suggests that four patterns of conflict can be discerned: &quot;truth versus loyalty, individual versus community, short term versus long term, and justice versus virtue&quot;. These cases of conflicts between different types of duties can be contrasted with conflicts in which one type of duty conflicts with itself, for example, if there is a conflict between two long-term obligations. Such cases are often called &quot;symmetric cases&quot;. The term &quot;problem of dirty hands&quot; refers to another form of ethical dilemmas, which specifically concerns political leaders who find themselves faced with the choice of violating commonly accepted morality in order to bring about some greater overall good.

== Existence of ethical dilemmas ==
The problem of the existence of ethical dilemmas concerns the question of whether there are any genuine ethical dilemmas, as opposed to, for example, merely apparent epistemic dilemmas or resolvable conflicts. The traditional position denies their existence but there are various defenders of their existence in contemporary philosophy. There are various arguments for and against both sides. Defenders of ethical dilemmas often point to apparent examples of dilemmas while their opponents usually aim to show their existence contradicts very fundamental ethical principles. Both sides face the challenge of reconciling these contradictory intuitions.

=== Arguments in favor ===
A common way to argue in favor of ethical dilemmas is to cite concrete examples. Such examples are quite common and can include cases from everyday life, stories, or thought experiments, like Sartre&#x27;s student or Sophie&#x27;s Choice discussed in the section on examples. The strength of arguments based on examples rests on the intuition that these cases actually are examples of genuine ethical dilemmas. Opponents of ethical dilemmas often reject this argument based on the claim that the initial intuitions in such cases are misleading. For example, it may turn out that the proposed situation is impossible, that one choice is objectively better than the other or that there is an additional choice that was not mentioned in the description of the example. But for the argument of the defenders to succeed, it is sufficient to have at least one genuine case. This constitutes a considerable difficulty for the opponents since they would have to show that our intuitions are mistaken not just about some of these cases but about all of them. Some opponents have responded to this difficulty by arguing that all these cases merely constitute &quot;epistemic&quot; but not &quot;genuine&quot; dilemmas, i.e. that the conflict merely seems unresolvable because of the agent&#x27;s lack of knowledge. This position is often defended by utilitarians. Support for it comes from the fact that the consequence of even simple actions are often too vast for us to properly anticipate. According to this interpretation, we mistake our uncertainty about which course of action outweighs the other for the idea that this conflict is not resolvable on the ontological level. Defenders of ethical dilemmas usually agree that there are many cases of epistemic dilemmas that are resolvable but seem unresolvable. However, they reject that this claim can be generalized to apply to all examples.

The argument from &quot;moral residue&quot; is another argument in favor of ethical dilemmas. &quot;Moral residue&quot;, in this context, refers to backward-looking emotions like guilt or remorse. These emotions are due to the impression of having done something wrong, of having failed to live up to one&#x27;s obligations. In some cases of moral residue, the agent is responsible herself because she made a bad choice which she regrets afterward. But in the case of an ethical dilemma, this is forced on the agent no matter how she decides. Going through the experience of moral residue is not just something that happens to the agent but it even seems to be the appropriate emotional response. The argument from moral residue uses this line of thought to argue in favor of ethical dilemmas by holding that the existence of ethical dilemmas is the best explanation for why moral residue in these cases is the appropriate response. Opponents can respond by arguing that the appropriate response is not guilt but regret, the difference being that regret is not dependent on the agent&#x27;s previous choices. By cutting the link to the possibly dilemmatic choice, the initial argument loses its force. Another counter-argument allows that guilt is the appropriate emotional response but denies that this indicates the existence of an underlying ethical dilemma. This line of argument can be made plausible by pointing to other examples, e.g. cases in which guilt is appropriate even though no choice whatsoever was involved.

=== Arguments against ===
Some of the strongest arguments against ethical dilemmas start from very general ethical principles and try to show that these principles are incompatible with the existence of ethical dilemmas, that their existence would therefore involve a contradiction.

One such argument proceeds from the &quot;agglomeration principle&quot; and the principle that ought implies can. According to the &quot;agglomeration principle&quot;, if an agent ought to do one thing and ought to do another thing then this agent ought to do both things. According to &quot;ought implies can&quot;, if an agent ought to do both things then the agent can do both things. But if the agent can do both things, there is no conflict between the two courses of action and therefore no dilemma. It may be necessary for defenders to deny either the &quot;agglomeration principle&quot; or the principle that &quot;ought implies can&quot;. Either choice is problematic since these principles are quite fundamental.

Another line of argumentation denies that there are unresolvable ethical conflicts. Such a view may accept that we have various duties, which may conflict with each other at times. But this is not problematic as long as there is always one duty that outweighs the others. It has been proposed that the different types of duties can be ordered into a hierarchy. So in cases of conflict, the higher duty would always take precedent over the lower one, for example, that telling the truth is always more important than keeping a promise. One problem with this approach is that it fails to solve &quot;symmetric&quot; cases: when two duties of the same type stand in conflict with each other. Another problem for such a position is that the weight of the different types of duties seems to be situation-specific: in some cases of conflict we should tell the truth rather than keep a promise, but in other cases the reverse is true. This is, for example, W. D. Ross&#x27;s position, according to which we stand under a number of different duties and have to decide on their relative weight based on the specific situation. But without a further argument, this line of thought just begs the question against the defender of ethical dilemmas, who may simply deny the claim that all conflicts can be resolved this way.

A different type of argument proceeds from the nature of moral theories. According to various authors, it is a requirement for good moral theories that they should be action-guiding by being able to recommend what should be done in any situation. But this is not possible when ethical dilemmas are involved. So these intuitions about the nature of good moral theories indirectly support the claim that there are no ethical dilemmas.

<text>Sporting colours or just colours (sometimes with a modifier, e.g. club colours or school colours) are awarded to members of a university or school who have excelled in a sport. Many schools do not limit their use to sport but may also give colours for academic excellence or non-sporting extra-curricular activities, Colours are traditionally indicated by the wearing of a special tie or blazer.

Many university colours are known by the name of the colour used, which is usually the colour worn by the university&#x27;s sports teams, e.g. Blue at Oxford and Cambridge, Palatinate at Durham, Pink at Trinity College Dublin or Red at Bristol. These are similar to the varsity letters awarded by American universities.

The level of representation required for the award of a colour varies between the different schemes. A full Palatinate at Durham, a Royal Blue at Liverpool or Full Colours at Cardiff require a student to have represented their country, while at Oxford the requirement for a full Blue is to have represented the university in a varsity match against Cambridge in an eligible sport. In many colour award schemes, it is possible to receive a half colour. These are normally given for lower levels of achievement than a full colour.

==History==
University colours were first introduced in the second University Boat Race between Oxford and Cambridge in 1836. Durham adopted palatinate purple for its degree hoods at about the same time. At Cambridge, teams would seek permission of the boat club to use their blue colour; by the 1860s the established sports with full blue status were rowing, cricket and athletics. In 1884, the rugby and football clubs awarded themselves blues following their varsity matches (against Oxford), leading to a debate at the Cambridge Union that was decisively lost by the boat club. The hockey club also gained full blue status (in 1894) before the system was formalised by the establishment of the blues committee in 1912.
The award of Palatinates for sports at Durham dates to at least 1883, when the cricket &quot;Eleven&quot; were permitted to wear the &quot;university coat&quot; (i.e. blazer) of palatinate purple rather than the claret coat of the club, and the award of both Palatinates and half Palatinates was well established by the end of the century. Manchester adopted maroon in 1905. Trinity College Dublin adopted Pink in 1950.

== University colours==

Different universities award different colours, often based on the colour worn by their athletes. Sometimes these are known by the colour used, but they may also simply be known as &quot;colours&quot;. These include:

* Aberdeen: Blue
* Bath: Blue
* Birmingham: Blue
* Bristol: Red
* Cambridge: Blue
* Cardiff: Colours
* Dublin: Pink or Colours
* Dundee: Blue (with Colours as a lower-level below Half Blue)
* Durham: Palatinate
* Edinburgh: Colours
* Glasgow: Blue
* Heriot-Watt: Blue
* Leeds: Colours
* Liverpool: Blue or Colours
* London: Purple
* Loughborough: AU Colours

<doc id="537640" wikidata="Q2263995" url="?curid=537640" title="Oak Street Connector">
<text>The Oak Street Connector, officially known as the Richard C. Lee Highway (named after former New Haven mayor Richard C. Lee), is a freeway carrying State Road 724 in downtown New Haven, Connecticut, United States. The freeway begins at Orange Street and ends at the junction of Interstate 91 (I-91) and Interstate 95. The road formerly carried Route 34 until the early 2020s.

==History==
As originally planned in 1957, the Connector was supposed to extend as a full expressway extending ten miles (16 km) westward from New Haven to a proposed interchange with Route 8 in the vicinity of the towns of Derby or Shelton, depending on the alignment selected for construction. The current connector section was completed in 1959.

The entire project was conceived with a dual purpose: urban renewal and traffic flow. The first goal was to completely clear this area of New Haven&#x27;s downtown. The highway replaced Oak Street (formerly Morocco Street) which had been a poor area since the days when leather workers congregated along West Creek. In the beginning of the twentieth century, the area became home to many Jewish and Irish immigrants. The freeway was also meant to bring cars into the city and facilitate the east–west flow of traffic between New Haven and its growing western suburbs. Due to its limited completion, only the first goal can be said to have been fully achieved. Other plans for the highway to be extended into a larger expressway from New Haven to Peekskill, New York were shelved in the mid-1970s, following successful challenges by highway opponents.

The right-of-way between South Frontage Road and Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard (originally North Frontage Road) in New Haven to Route 10 was preserved for a future extension of the connector past Route 10 to rejoin the existing Route 34 at a signalized intersection west of Route 122 in Orange. A small portion of the planned freeway extension that was built in Orange during the 1980s was used as a commuter parking lot for more than two decades, but now serves as part of an access road for the Yale-New Haven Health Regional Operations Center.

==Decommissioning==
During Connecticut&#x27;s budget crisis of 2002, the State of Connecticut sold off land acquired for numerous planned expressways throughout the state, including land set aside for extending the Oak Street Connector. Pfizer Pharmaceuticals purchased a portion of the Oak Street Connector right-of-way, and built a US$35 million research facility on it. The Pfizer deal ensured the Oak Street Connector could not be extended beyond its terminus at the Air Rights Parking Garage near Yale-New Haven Hospital.

After the completion of the Pfizer research facility in 2005, New Haven Mayor John DeStefano, Jr. and several leaders of local civic groups began pushing the Connecticut Department of Transportation (ConnDOT) to study removing part of the existing Oak Street Connector (re-routing traffic onto Legion Avenue and M.L.K. Jr. Boulevard in the process) and replacing it with buildings and developments.

The project would remove the portion of the Oak Street Connector west of Orange Street, creating two large parcels of land divided by College Street on which buildings and developments could be built. Inbound traffic would be re-routed onto Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard (aka North Frontage Road) while outbound traffic would be re-routed onto Legion Avenue (aka South Frontage Road). In addition, both roads would be rebuilt and widened to accommodate increased traffic, and furnished with landscaping and bicycle lanes. The road bed of the original highway would be reused as a driveway to and from the Air Rights Garage, allowing commuters to reach the Air Rights Garage while avoiding traffic on College and Church streets. The segment of the Oak Street Connector east of Orange Street was retained as a freeway stub connecting the new frontage streets with the I-91/I-95 interchange, which itself was also rebuilt from 2011 to 2016. The remaining stub includes the bridge that carries the Oak Street Connector over the New Haven Railyard.

The removal of part of this freeway stub would be part of a larger project called New Haven Downtown Crossing which seeks to reconnect New Haven&#x27;s street grid which was originally disconnected by the construction of the connector.

ConnDOT and the City of New Haven began preparing the environmental impact statement for removing the Oak Street Connector in 2011, and in mid-2013 construction began on phase one of Downtown Crossing began which completed the aforementioned upgrades to Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, as well as construction of 100 College Street. The Oak Street Connector west of Orange Street officially closed to westbound traffic on July 14, 2014, with traffic re-routed onto the newly-rebuilt Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. A portion of the old roadbed remains in use as a driveway to and from the Air Rights Garage. Eastbound traffic was officially rerouted to Legion Avenue in 2018.

<doc id="537663" wikidata="Q620876" url="?curid=537663" title="Human body weight">
<text>Human body weight is a person&#x27;s mass or weight.

Strictly speaking, body weight is the measurement of mass without items located on the person. Practically though, body weight may be measured with clothes on, but without shoes or heavy accessories such as mobile phones and wallets, and using manual or digital weighing scales. Excess or reduced body weight is regarded as an indicator of determining a person&#x27;s health, with body volume measurement providing an extra dimension by calculating the distribution of body weight.

Average adult human weight varies by continent, from about in Asia and Africa to about in North America, with men on average weighing more than women.

== Estimation in children ==
There are a number of methods to estimate weight in children for circumstances (such as emergencies) when actual weight cannot be measured. Most involve a parent or health care provider guessing the child&#x27;s weight through weight-estimation formulas. These formulas base their findings on the child&#x27;s age and tape-based systems of weight estimation. Of the many formulas that have been used for estimating body weight, some include the Advanced Pediatric Life Support formula, the Leffler formula, and Theron formula. There are also several types of tape-based systems for estimating children&#x27;s weight, with the best-known being the Broselow tape. The Broselow tape is based on length with weight read from the appropriate color area. Newer systems, such as the PAWPER tape, make use of a simple two-step process to estimate weight: the length-based weight estimation is modified according to the child&#x27;s body habitus to increase the accuracy of the final weight prediction.

The Leffler formula is used for children 0–10 years of age. In those less than a year old, it is

formula_1

and for those 1–10 years old, it is

formula_2

where &quot;m&quot; is the number of kilograms the child weighs and &quot;am&quot; and &quot;ay&quot; respectively are the number of months or years old the child is.

The Theron formula is

formula_3

where &quot;m&quot; and &quot;ay&quot; are as above.

== Fluctuation ==
Body weight varies in small amounts throughout the day, as the amount of water in the body is not constant. It changes due to activities such as drinking, urinating, or exercise. Professional sports participants may deliberately dehydrate themselves to enter a lower weight class, a practice known as weight cutting.

==Ideal body weight==
Ideal body weight (IBW) was initially introduced by Ben J. Devine in 1974 to allow estimation of drug clearances in obese patients; researchers have since shown that the metabolism of certain drugs relates more to IBW than total body weight. The term was based on the use of insurance data that demonstrated the relative mortality for males and females according to different height-weight combinations.

The most common estimation of IBW is by the Devine formula; other models exist and have been noted to give similar results. Other methods used in estimating the ideal body weight are body mass index and the Hamwi method. The IBW is not the perfect fat measurement, as it does not show the fat or muscle percentage in one&#x27;s body. For example, athletes&#x27; results may show that they are overweight when they are actually very fit and healthy. Machines like the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can accurately measure the percentage and weight of fat, muscle, and bone in a body.

===Devine formula===
The Devine formula for calculating ideal body weight in adults is as follows:
* Male ideal body weight = + × (height (cm) − 152)
* Female ideal body weight = + × (height (cm) − 152)

===Hamwi method===
The Hamwi method is used to calculate the ideal body weight of the general adult:
* Male ideal body weight = + × (height (cm) − 152)
* Female ideal body weight = + × (height (cm) − 152)

==Usage==
===Sports===
Many disciplines in weightlifting or combat sports separate competitors into weight classes.

===Medicine===
Ideal body weight, specifically the Devine formula, is used clinically for multiple reasons, most commonly in estimating renal function in drug dosing, and predicting pharmacokinetics in morbidly obese patients.

==Average weight around the world==
===By region===

Data from 2005:

====Global statistics====
Researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine published a study of average weights of adult humans in the journal &quot;BMC Public Health&quot; and at the United Nations conference Rio+20.

<doc id="537664" wikidata="Q114306" url="?curid=537664" title="Wellington College, Berkshire">
<text>Wellington College is a co-educational public school providing education for boarding and day pupils in the village of Crowthorne, in Berkshire, in the United Kingdom. Wellington is a registered charity and currently educates roughly 1,100 pupils aged between 13 and 18. The college was built as a national monument to the military victory against Napoleon, and the political service as British Prime Minister, of the first Duke of Wellington, in whose honour it is named. It was established by Royal Charter in 1853. Queen Victoria laid the foundation stone in 1856, and inaugurated the school&#x27;s public opening on 29 January 1859.

Many former Wellington pupils fought in the trenches during the First World War, with a large number volunteering for military service immediately after leaving school. In all, 707 Wellington old boys lost their lives in the conflict. A further 501 former pupils were killed in action in the Second World War. 

The school is a member of the Rugby Group of 18 British public schools and is also a member of the G20 Schools group. For the academic year 2023/24, Wellington charged boarders up to £18,310 per term, or £50,930 per annum.

In March 2023, the school was awarded Artsmark Platinum by the Arts Council England. Since 2020, the school has continuously been listed by &quot;The Schools Index&quot; as one of the world&#x27;s leading 150 schools and one of the top 30 UK senior schools.

==History==

Wellington College was granted a royal charter in 1853 as The Royal and Religious Foundation of the Wellington College, and was opened in 1859. Its first Master, which is the title of the headmaster, was Edward White Benson, who later became Archbishop of Canterbury. The college&#x27;s Visitor was Queen Elizabeth II.

Originally, the school educated sons of deceased officers who had held commissions in the Army. In 1952 a Supplementary Royal Charter extended the privilege of eligibility to the orphan sons of deceased officers of the Royal Navy, Royal Marines and Royal Air Force. By the 1960s, the school was considering becoming co-educational, but for some years the lack of financial resources prevented it from doing so. The first girls were admitted into the Sixth Form in the 1970s, and the school became fully co-educational in 2005. A recent change to the scheme of reduced fees early in 2006 extended the privilege to the orphan children of deceased servicemen or servicewomen of His Majesty&#x27;s Armed Forces irrespective of rank, and to the orphan children of persons who, in the sole opinion of the Governors, have died in acts of selfless bravery. However, only a minority of the children at the school now come from military families.

On 6 September 2013, readers of &quot;The Week&quot; magazine voted Wellington College &quot;The Most Forward-Thinking School in the UK&quot;, and four days later &quot;Tatler&quot; magazine chose Wellington College as the &quot;Best Senior School in Britain&quot;, at its Schools Awards evening in London. In 2024, Wellington College was once again featured in &quot;Tatler&quot; magazine, with the Master, James Dahl, being nominated for &quot;Best Head of a Public School&quot;.

==&#x27;Wellbeing&#x27; classes==
Following reports, in the early 2000s, that some pupils at Wellington College had been subjected to bullying, the then-new Master of the College, Sir Anthony Seldon, an author and historian, introduced &#x27;wellbeing&#x27; classes to the curriculum, in conjunction with a team at the University of Cambridge. He felt that it was important to help his pupils find the best ways to be happy, and explained the reasons for introducing the subject to the curriculum.

===The Wellington Academy===
Wellington has sponsored the founding of a new independent state school in Wiltshire, The Wellington Academy, which opened in 2009, at the instigation of the former Master of the College, Sir Anthony Seldon.

===Wellington College International===
Wellington is in partnership with Wellington College International Tianjin, in the city of Tianjin in mainland China, modelled on the buildings and ethos of the college, and which opened in August 2011. Wellington is also partnered with Wellington College International Shanghai and Huili School Shanghai in the city of Shanghai, and Wellington College International Hangzhou and Huili School Hangzhou in the city of Hangzhou (also in mainland China), Wellington College International Bangkok in Thailand, and Wellington College International Pune in India.

==Architecture==

The college buildings were designed by John Shaw, Jr., who had previously worked as an architect for Eton College. For its time, the design of the College was unusual compared to the popular form, but Prince Albert, who assisted in choosing the architect, was more interested in Shaw&#x27;s classical approach, having already seen the architect&#x27;s design for the old Royal Naval School in New Cross, London. The main buildings were designed in a style loosely termed &quot;French Grand Rococo&quot;.
The chapel, notably only half its originally intended size, was designed by Sir Gilbert Scott. There have been several modern buildings, the best of which follow Shaw&#x27;s grand rococo style: for example, the new Nicholson modern foreign-languages building. In 2019 the GWA Performing Arts Centre was opened, housing an auditorium with 900 seats for use by pupils and to raise funds for the Wellington College Arts Fund. 

The college was used as a filming location for the Netflix series &quot;The Crown&quot; as a stand-in for Kensington Palace (designed by Sir Christopher Wren) in seasons 2, 3, 4 and 5 first as the home of Princess Margaret and then of Diana, Princess of Wales. One of the college&#x27;s original mottos &quot;Heroum Filii&quot; is visible in a scene of the Queen arriving at the palace, and the college&#x27;s official motto, &quot;Virtutis Fortuna Comes&quot;, is visible in a scene of the Queen leaving the palace.

==Location==

Wellington College stands on a estate in South-East England, near Reading and Sandhurst. The grounds of the college include a theatre, a 9-hole golf course, a science block, a language learning centre, extensive woodland, an indoor swimming pool and games courts, and many playing fields, particularly those for cricket and rugby.

The grounds include a separate Mandarin language centre, with a pagoda and Chinese water garden. The centre is believed to be the largest of its kind in the UK.
The woodland area of the college is listed as a Local Nature Reserve (LNR) called Edgbarrow Woods. The grounds also contain a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), known as Wellington College Bog.

==Academic results==
In 2024, 66.3% of pupils scored A*-A for their A-Level examinations, with 44% achieving 40 points or more in their IB examinations. In the same year, 65% of pupils scored 9 or 8 grades in their GCSEs. In 2024, the school had an average IB score of 38.4 and the College’s best ever return of A* grades at A-Level: 31.7%. Over 20 pupils scored three A* grades or better.

==Sport==

Wellington College was one of the 21 founding members of the Rugby Football Union, and pupils at the school have historically played schoolboy rugby to the highest standard. In 2008, the College became the first school to win the Daily Mail Cup at both U15 and U18 level in the same year, beating Millfield School and St Benedict&#x27;s School, Ealing in their respective finals at Twickenham on 2 April 2008. 

A number of Old Wellingtonians play professional rugby union, including: James Haskell (England), Paul Doran-Jones (England), Max Lahiff (Bath Rugby and Bristol Bears), brothers Max Evans and Thom Evans (Scotland), Sam Aspland-Robinson (Harlequins), Rory Brand (London Irish), who was the College&#x27;s first recipient of the Jimmy Higham Scholarship, and Madison Hughes (USA 7s).
The school has one of only around 20 racquets courts in the UK, one of 27 real tennis courts in the UK and until 2005 three Eton Fives courts, now a café bar as part of the sports club.

==Response to &#x27;cartel&#x27; reports==
In 2005 the school was one of fifty of the country&#x27;s leading independent schools found guilty of running an illegal price-fixing cartel, exposed by &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper, which had allowed them to drive up fees for thousands of parents. Each school was required to pay a nominal penalty of £10,000 and all agreed to make ex-gratia payments totalling three million pounds into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information was shared. 

However, Mrs. Jean Scott, the then-head of the Independent Schools Council, said that independent schools had always been exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business, were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other, and were unaware of the change in the law (on which they had not been consulted). She wrote to John Vickers, the OFT director-general, saying, &quot;They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer. They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed.&quot;

==Houses==
There are 18 houses at Wellington. The majority are composed of boarders with a small number of day pupils also, although two, Wellesley and Raglan, are day-pupil exclusive. Each house is either an &#x27;in-house&#x27; or an &#x27;out-house&#x27;: in-houses are located within the main school buildings and quads while out-houses are located elsewhere on the college grounds. Each house has aspects distinguishing it from other houses, such as its own colours, insignia, and crest (with the crest of each house being incorporated into one of each of the stained glass windows of the college chapel). Each house was named in honour of a significant figure in history, usually although not exclusively figures associated with the Duke of Wellington.

<text>Daniel Joseph Greene (c. 1850 – December 12, 1911) was a Newfoundland politician who briefly served as the colony&#x27;s Premier.

A native of St. John&#x27;s, he studied law at Laval University and became a lawyer. Daniel Greene was first elected to the House of Assembly in 1875 and became Leader of the Opposition in 1887. In 1889 he became a minister in the government of Liberal Premier Sir William Whiteway. A year after the controversial 1893 elections Whiteway&#x27;s government was dismissed by the governor Arthur Murray due to petitions alleging corrupt electoral practices. Murray appointed Tory leader Augustus F. Goodridge as the new premier and helped the minority government stay in office. However, Goodridge resigned in December 1894 after the collapse of two banks.

Greene had become acting Liberal leader due to the disbarment of Whiteway from holding electoral office. On December 13, 1894, following the collapse of Goodridge&#x27;s government, Greene was sworn in as premier.

Green&#x27;s government promptly passed the Disabilities Removal Act allowing candidates who had been disqualified because of election irregularities in 1893 to seek election again. Specifically, it allowed Whiteway to return as Premier which occurred on February 8, 1895 when Greene resigned.

He died in St. John&#x27;s in 1911.

His nephew Joseph M. Greene also served in the Newfoundland House of Assembly from 1928 to 1932. Joseph Green&#x27;s son, James Greene, was leader of the Opposition Conservative Party from 1960 to 1966.

<text>Christopher Wesson Bosh (born March 24, 1984) is an American former professional basketball player. A Texas Mr. Basketball in high school, he played one season of college basketball for Georgia Tech before declaring for the 2003 NBA draft. Bosh was selected fourth overall by the Toronto Raptors. He is considered to be one of the greatest power forwards of all time, and one of the best players of his generation.

While at Toronto, Bosh became a five-time NBA All-Star, was named to the All-NBA Second Team once, played for the U.S. national team (with whom he won a gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics), and supplanted former fan favorite Vince Carter as the face and leader of the Raptors franchise. In the 2006–07 season, Bosh led the Raptors to their first playoff appearance in five years and their first-ever division title. He left Toronto in 2010 as the franchise&#x27;s all-time leader in points, rebounds, blocks, and minutes played.

In 2010, after seven seasons with the Raptors, Bosh entered into a sign-and-trade deal whereby he was traded to the Miami Heat. In Miami, he joined fellow stars Dwyane Wade and LeBron James; the trio became known as the Big Three. Bosh spent the second half of his career with Miami, appearing in the NBA Finals each year from 2011 to 2014 and winning NBA titles in 2012 and 2013. Bosh made the NBA All-Star team every year during his time in Miami. Bosh&#x27;s career was cut short by a blood clotting condition that the NBA ruled to be a career-ending illness. He played his final NBA game on February 9, 2016. Notwithstanding the NBA&#x27;s ruling, Bosh fought to resume his playing career for three years before announcing in February 2019 that he intended to retire. The same year, the Heat retired Bosh&#x27;s No. 1 jersey. In 2021, Bosh was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame.

Seeking to promote sports and education amongst youths in Dallas and Toronto, Bosh set up the Chris Bosh Foundation and regularly speaks to youths about the benefits of reading.

==Early life==
Born to Noel and Freida Bosh in Dallas, Texas, on March 24, 1984, Bosh was raised in Hutchins, a suburb of the city. A family-oriented person, he would often play basketball in the house with his younger brother, Joel. At the early age of four years old, Bosh started learning how to dribble a basketball in the gym where his father played pick-up games. Since Bosh was always tall for his age, he was accustomed to out-rebounding his peers whenever he played. However, Bosh only started learning the game of basketball seriously around fourth grade, doing so at a playground near his grandmother&#x27;s house.

As a child, Bosh participated in karate and gymnastics. He also played baseball up until high school, chiefly as a first baseman according to his preference.

Growing up, Bosh names his parents as the biggest influence on his personality and considered NBA superstar Kevin Garnett as his favorite athlete, after whom Bosh modeled his play. Academically, Bosh always excelled in school as he was a member of the National Honor Society and several student engineering organizations.

Bosh began garnering significant attention from college recruiters after leading Lincoln High School in Dallas to the top ranking in the country and to the &quot;USA Today&quot; National Championship with a perfect 40–0 season.

The 6-foot-11 teenager helped Lincoln High capture the Class 4A state title after delivering 23 points and 17 rebounds to go along with nine blocks. Bosh was subsequently named High School Player of the Year by Basketball America; Powerade Player of the Year in Texas; a first-team All-American by &quot;Parade&quot;, McDonald&#x27;s, and EA Sports; a second-team all-American by &quot;USA Today&quot; and &quot;SLAM&quot; Magazine; a first-team all-state player; and &quot;Mr. Basketball&quot; in Texas by the Texas Association of Basketball Coaches. With his combination of grades and basketball skills, Bosh&#x27;s name was on a number of college recruiting lists. The University of Florida and University of Memphis among them made serious overtures, but it was Paul Hewitt, coach of Georgia Tech, who made the best impression. Bosh felt that Hewitt had his best interests at heart and respected his aspiration to play professionally; moreover, Bosh was sufficiently impressed by what he saw of Georgia Tech&#x27;s transition offense.

==College career==
Bosh eventually chose to follow the footsteps of his cousin and aunt and attended Georgia Tech to study graphic design and computer imaging, and subsequently, management. There, Bosh led the Yellow Jackets in averaging 15.6 points, 9.0 rebounds and 2.2 blocks in 31 games, and led the Atlantic Coast Conference in field goal percentage (.560), joining Antawn Jamison as the only freshmen ever to do so. Bosh originally intended to complete his degree, but by the end of the 2002–03 season, Bosh was convinced that he was ready for the NBA due to his strong performances. Bosh left Georgia Tech after his freshman season and entered the 2003 NBA draft. Bosh said in future interviews that although he misses his college days, he believes he made the right decision to pursue a professional basketball career.

==Professional career==

===Toronto Raptors (2003–2010)===
====Rookie year (2003–2004)====
In what is widely regarded as one of the strongest draft classes in NBA history, which included future All-Stars LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Dwyane Wade, Bosh was selected fourth overall by the Toronto Raptors in the 2003 NBA draft and was signed on July 8, 2003. However, prior to his signing, other NBA teams made offers for Bosh as they knew Toronto needed a veteran scorer, and Raptors star Vince Carter himself pressed for a trade. General Manager Glen Grunwald turned everyone down.

In his rookie season, Bosh was forced to play out of position as the Raptors&#x27; starting center after Antonio Davis was traded to the Chicago Bulls. Night after night, the teenager with the &quot;slim frame&quot; battled against opponents who had a significant size and strength advantage over him. Bosh—who cited teammate Michael Curry as his mentor—was often praised by his coaches for his heart, and willingness to play through pain and injuries resulting from his lack of body strength compared to some of the league&#x27;s strong forwards and centers. Bosh&#x27;s contributions were not unnoticed by teammates either, as he averaged 11.5 points, 7.4 rebounds, 1.4 blocks, and 33.5 minutes in 75 games, leading all rookies in rebounding and blocks, and setting a franchise record for most rebounds in a rookie season with 557. Bosh was rewarded by being selected to the NBA All-Rookie First Team for the 2003–04 season.

====Heralded as the new hope (2004–2006)====

With the departure of the disenchanted franchise face of the team, Vince Carter, in December 2004, Bosh was simultaneously anointed as the new leader around whom Toronto would build. In the remaining games following Carter&#x27;s departure, the power forward averaged 18.4 points, 9.5 rebounds, 1.6 blocks, and 38.1 minutes per game, improving in every major statistical category. Bosh was awarded his first ever NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played between January 3 and 9, 2005. As the season drew to a close, analysts predicted that Bosh would become an All-Star one day. He finished the 2004–05 season as the leading scorer and leading rebounder for the team on 21 and 46 occasions respectively.

Prior to the 2005–06 season, Bosh was named as one of Toronto&#x27;s team captains. Bosh continued to work on his game as he consistently chalked up double-doubles, leading the team in scoring, rebounding, and field goal percentage for the first half of the season. On February 9, 2006, for the first time in his career, Bosh was selected to play in the 2006 NBA All-Star Game in Houston, Texas as a reserve forward for the Eastern Conference. He was only the third Raptor to make an All-Star game, after Carter and Antonio Davis. Bosh&#x27;s selection was just three days after being named NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the second time in his career. In March 2006, following a season-ending injury to Bosh, the Raptors hit a 1–10 skid. This highlighted Bosh&#x27;s importance as the centerpiece of the offense, as well as the leader of the team. The Raptors finished the season 27–55 and Bosh averaged 22.5 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game.

====Leader of the division champions (2006–2007)====

Despite a major off-season revamp of the Raptors roster—including the departure of good friends Mike James and Charlie Villanueva—Bosh officially signed a three-year contract extension with a player option for a fourth year on July 14, 2006. The deal was reportedly worth US$65 million over four years. Upon signing the contract, Bosh said &quot;I think the future is very positive for the franchise... change was needed... we have a lot of guys who just want to win and are willing to work hard.&quot; During the same press conference, Bosh also announced a donation of $1 million to a Toronto charity, known as Community Legacy Programs.

After a rocky start to the Raptors&#x27; 2006–07 campaign, the Raptors managed to surpass the .500 mark as the All-Star break approached. Bosh&#x27;s play and leadership were pivotal to this run and as an increasing recognition of his abilities. On January 25, 2007, Bosh was named an All-Star starter for the East in the 2007 NBA All-Star Game. He received the second highest number of votes among all Eastern Conference forwards. This was Bosh&#x27;s first All-Star start and second overall All-Star appearance, having averaged over 22 points and 11 rebounds in the first half of the season. On January 31, 2007, in a game against the Washington Wizards, Bosh scored a buzzer-beating shot to end the third quarter. He shot 15-of-15 after missing his first four shots. Bosh&#x27;s in-form streak enabled him to be selected Eastern Conference Player of the Month for January 2007. He had averaged 25.4 points and 9.1 rebounds while leading the Raptors to a 10–5 record in that month. On February 7, 2007, Bosh&#x27;s career-high 41 points prompted the home fans to chant &quot;MVP&quot;—an unprecedented event in the Air Canada Centre. Two days later, Bosh collected 29 points and 11 rebounds against the Los Angeles Lakers, shooting 10-of-10 in the second half.

On March 28, 2007, Bosh became the new franchise record holder for double-doubles in a home win against the Miami Heat. He was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the third time in his career shortly after, having led Toronto to clinch a playoff berth for the first time in five years. Toronto went on to win its first ever division title, and concluded the regular season with a 47–35 record, including a 30–11 home record, both franchise records. As the third seed, the Raptors played sixth seed New Jersey Nets in the first round of the 2007 NBA playoffs. The series drew much media attention as Carter, who had left Toronto under acrimonious circumstances, was back at the ACC as a Net. Toronto&#x27;s inexperience was evident as they struggled offensively throughout the game, to eventually lose 96–91. The Raptors won Game 2 at the ACC to tie the series 1–1, as Bosh recorded 25 points and a game-high 13 rebounds. The Nets won Games 3 and 4 to lead 3–1, but Toronto forced Game 6 when they narrowly won Game 5 by a score of 98–96. The Nets went on to clinch the series with a win in Game 6. Bosh averaged a double-double with 22.6 points per game and 10.7 rebounds per game for the regular season, both career-highs, and posted 17.5 points per game and 9.0 rebounds per game in the playoffs. He was named to the All-NBA Second Team at the end of the 2006–07 campaign.

====Struggles (2007–2009)====

Before the 2007–08 season began, Andrea Bargnani, the number one pick in the 2006 NBA draft, was slated to start at center and Bosh at power forward to form a strong Toronto frontcourt and Jason Kapono, a three-point specialist, was acquired via free agency from the Miami Heat to add offensive firepower. However, as the season unfolded, neither plan materialized as hoped. Bosh himself had a slow start to the season, but as mid-season approached, his form picked up and he was named Player of the Week for the second week of January. On January 31, 2008, Bosh was selected to be on the Eastern Conference team for the 2008 NBA All-Star Game. He missed 15 games throughout the season, but the Raptors still managed to conclude the regular season with a 41–41 record, thus clinching the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference for the 2008 NBA playoffs. However, they were defeated by the Orlando Magic in the first round, losing 4–1.

The first-round series against the Magic was touted as the matchup between two of the league&#x27;s best young big men in Bosh and Dwight Howard. Howard dominated throughout the series, while Bosh had a series-best effort in game 4 with 39 points and 15 rebounds. General Manager Bryan Colangelo said at a press conference after the series, &quot;Whether it&#x27;s protecting [Bosh] inside the paint, getting a little bit more of a presence in there, to just getting him another scorer that&#x27;s going to shoulder some of that burden, it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s clear we have to get better&quot;, hinting that the roster was in need of an overhaul. After the loss, Bosh said, &quot;They played a great series, they executed on offence and defense better than we did and when it came to the small things, they did a better job... I can&#x27;t sit here and bark in protest that the better team didn&#x27;t win. That&#x27;s pretty obvious. They beat us pretty good.&quot; Unlike the previous campaign, Bosh was not named to any of the All-NBA teams.

To provide Bosh with an experienced frontcourt partner, the Raptors pulled a blockbuster trade prior to the 2008–09 campaign: six-time All-Star Jermaine O&#x27;Neal was acquired from the Indiana Pacers. Bosh—who had won an Olympic gold medal with the national team at Beijing 2008—started the season strong. He averaged 26 points, 10 rebounds and 3.7 assists in his first three games and was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the fifth time in his career. A week later, he became Toronto&#x27;s all-time leader in offensive rebounds, surpassing Antonio Davis&#x27;s record. While Bosh and O&#x27;Neal formed a formidable partnership in the frontcourt, the Raptors struggled to surpass the .500 mark. The principal deficiency of previous campaigns—wing players—continued to upend Toronto&#x27;s progress. With the Raptors at 8–9, head coach Sam Mitchell was sacked and replaced by Jay Triano. Despite the move, injuries and weaknesses in the roster meant that the Raptors entered the All-Star break 13 games under .500. On January 29, 2009, Bosh was named an All-Star reserve, but an injury ruled him out of the game. Two weeks later, in a bid to bring in a wing player and create greater salary flexibility, O&#x27;Neal and Jamario Moon were traded to Miami for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks. However, the trade did not improve the team&#x27;s win–loss record, and the Raptors were eliminated from contention with seven games of the regular season remaining. The bright spark in Bosh&#x27;s campaign was his career-high 22.7 points per game, as well as him being one of two players in the league that season (the other being Dwight Howard) to average a 20/10 in points and rebounds. On April 20, 2009, Colangelo announced that he would offer Bosh a contract extension during the summer, which Bosh later refused to sign.

====Overhauling the roster (2009–2010)====
To prepare for the 2009–10 season, Bosh worked out under Ken Roberson, looking to add and bring his weight up to . Following the failure of the 2008–09 campaign, Colangelo knew that he had to shake up the roster to persuade Bosh to stay, and the Raptors were one of the busiest teams in the pre-season market. They opened their season with a win against the heavily favored Cleveland Cavaliers, in which Bosh scored 21 points and pulled down 16 rebounds. Bosh went on a tear, averaging 25.4 points and 11.9 rebounds in the first 16 games, but the Raptors were only able to win seven of those games. The Raptors crossed into 2010 with a 16–17 record, and on January 3, 2010, Bosh overtook Vince Carter as Toronto&#x27;s all-time leader in total points scored. After pulling together a string of wins, the Raptors were .500 after 40 games. Bosh was the league leader in double-doubles at the time, being only one of two players in the league who averaged at least 20 points and 10 rebounds a game. On January 20, 2010, he scored a career-high 44 points in a loss against the Milwaukee Bucks, while collecting his 220th career double-double. That same month, Bosh was named a reserve for the Eastern Conference All-Star team, and was Eastern Conference Player of the Week. After the All-Star break, the Raptors went on several losing streaks and an injury to Bosh exacerbated the situation. As the regular season came to a close, the Raptors went from being the fifth seed before the All-Star break to fighting for the eighth and final playoff spot with the Chicago Bulls. After recording his 44th double-double on March 22, 2010, Bosh became the Raptors&#x27; all-time leader in number of double-doubles in a season. On April 5, 2010, he was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week, winning the honor for the seventh time in his career (tying Carter for the most in franchise history). However, Bosh was unable to play in a pivotal match against the Bulls on April 11, 2010. The blowout loss cost Toronto their tie-breaker and ultimately the eighth seed, as the Bulls finished with 41 wins to Toronto&#x27;s 40.

===Miami Heat (2010–2017)===
====Joining the Heat and debut season (2010–2011)====

After the 2009–10 season was over, there was much speculation over whether coveted free agents such as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Bosh would sign with new teams for the 2010–11 season. Bosh was active on the social media front, posting his thoughts on Twitter and having a documentary crew record his meetings with the teams interested in signing him. Bosh signed a 6-year, $110 million contract with the Miami Heat on July 10, 2010, through a sign-and-trade deal, which sent two 2011 first-round draft picks to the Raptors (Norris Cole and Jonas Valančiūnas were later selected). Bosh was a part of the first player-created NBA superteam. His parting message to the Raptors on his website said, &quot;[K]now that this was my toughest decision, mostly because Toronto has been so great to me. I&#x27;ve loved every minute here and I just wanted to thank you from the bottom of my heart...&quot; Not only did Bosh leave Toronto as its all-time leader in virtually all major statistical categories, he was one of only three players in the league who accrued 10,000 points, 4,500 rebounds, and 600 blocks in his seven seasons with the Raptors.

Despite being widely tipped as contenders, the Heat got off to a tentative 9–8 start. However, the Heat managed to go on to compile a 21–1 record and were jostling with the Boston Celtics and Chicago Bulls for pole position in the Eastern Conference as mid-season approached. Miami finished the regular season with 58 wins and faced the Philadelphia in the first round of the playoffs. Miami won the series in five games, and also prevailed in five games in the semi-finals against Boston. In the Conference Finals against Chicago, Bosh was particularly instrumental, averaging 23.2 points in the 4–1 series win. He was slow off the blocks in the NBA Finals against the Dallas Mavericks, shooting below .300 in the first two games, but made the game-winning shot in Game 3 to give Miami a 2–1 lead. That was the last game Miami won, as Dallas won the next three to win its first-ever championship. Bosh was seen in tears as he walked to the locker room following the loss.

====Consecutive NBA championships (2011–2013)====

On January 5, 2012, Bosh led the Heat to a 116–109 triple-overtime win against the Atlanta Hawks, highlighted by a three-point shot he made to force the game into overtime with 0.6 seconds left to play in the fourth quarter. Bosh finished the game with 33 points, 14 rebounds, five assists, two steals, and two blocked shots. By the end of the season, the Heat had embraced a small-ball strategy that featured Bosh at the center position.

In the playoffs, Bosh averaged 14.0 points and 7.8 rebounds a game. In Game 1 of the Conference Semi-finals against the Indiana Pacers, he suffered a lower abdominal strain that forced him to miss the rest of the series and the first four games of the Eastern Conference Finals against Boston. Bosh returned in the Conference Finals against Boston. He was moved to center for the remainder of the playoffs, while James, who had filled in at power forward during his absence, remained at that position. Boston pushed Miami to seven games, and in the final game, Bosh scored 19 points, including 3-of-4 shooting from three-point range, to help the Heat advance to their second straight NBA Finals, this time against the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Thunder won the first game of the series before Miami rolled to a 4–1 victory, giving Bosh his first NBA championship. Bosh scored 24 points in the deciding Game 5 and averaged 14.6 points and 9.4 rebounds in the Finals.

Bosh remained the Heat&#x27;s starting center for the 2012–13 season. On February 15, 2013, Bosh was picked as an All-Star starter over the injured Rajon Rondo by coach Erik Spoelstra. The Heat achieved the league&#x27;s best record and swept through the first round of the playoffs against the Milwaukee Bucks before defeating the Chicago Bulls in five games, with Bosh recording 20 points and 19 rebounds in a crucial Game 3 victory in Chicago. Bosh averaged 12.1 points per game throughout the playoffs, as the Heat advanced to the NBA Finals to face the San Antonio Spurs following a grueling seven-game series against Indiana. The Heat and Spurs split the first two games before the Spurs blew out Miami in Game 3 to take a 2–1 series lead. In Game 4, Bosh recorded 20 points and 13 rebounds to complement Wade&#x27;s 32 points and James&#x27;s 33 points to bolster the Heat&#x27;s win, tying the series. San Antonio bounced back in Game 5 to force the Heat to win the final two games at home. In the final seconds of Game 6, James missed a three-pointer, and Bosh grabbed the offensive rebound and found a wide-open Ray Allen in the corner. Allen hit the shot to tie the game, and in overtime the Heat had a three-point lead with seconds left. San Antonio inbounded the ball to Danny Green, who attempted a corner three, but Green&#x27;s shot was blocked by Bosh to secure the Heat&#x27;s victory. Bosh was held scoreless in Game 7 by Tim Duncan, but the Heat still won the game and the series to claim their second consecutive NBA championship.

====Coming up short (2013–2014)====
In the 2013–14 season, Bosh played and started in 79 games, averaging 16.2 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. He also hit a career-high 74 three-point shots on 33 percent shooting from beyond the arc. In the playoffs, Bosh helped the Heat return to the NBA Finals, where they faced the San Antonio Spurs once again. This time, however, the Heat were outclassed by the Spurs as they lost the series in five games.

====Post-Big Three era (2014–2016)====
On July 30, 2014, after wide speculation that he would join the Houston Rockets, Bosh re-signed with the Heat to a five-year, $118 million contract after LeBron James announced that he was leaving Miami to return to the Cleveland Cavaliers. After averaging 21.6 points, 8.2 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.1 steals over the first 23 games of the 2014–15 season, Bosh was ruled out indefinitely on December 15 with a calf strain. He went on to miss eight games before returning on December 29 against the Orlando Magic. After playing in the 2015 All-Star Game, Bosh was admitted to a Miami hospital for lung tests during the All-Star break. On February 21, 2015, he was ruled out for the rest of the season due to a blood clot in one of his lungs.

On October 28, 2015, Bosh made his return to the court in the Heat&#x27;s season opener against the Charlotte Hornets, recording 21 points and 10 rebounds during a 104–94 victory. On November 10, 2015, he scored a then season-high 30 points in a 101–88 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers. On December 28, 2015, Bosh recorded 24 points and 12 rebounds against the Brooklyn Nets, and hit a career-best 5-of-5 from three-point range. On January 4, 2016, he recorded a season-high 31 points and 11 rebounds in a 103–100 overtime win over the Indiana Pacers. Though Bosh was voted to play in the 2016 NBA All-Star Game, and selected to compete in the Three-Point Contest, Bosh was forced to withdraw from both due to a calf injury.

A blood clot in his leg again forced Bosh to miss time following the 2016 All-Star break. He faced increasing pressure from physicians and the Heat organization to sit out the rest of the season because of the potential dangers of the recurring medical condition. Following the Heat&#x27;s February 9 game against San Antonio, Bosh did not play any regular-season or playoff games for Miami in 2016. On May 4, 2016, the Heat announced that Bosh would be held out for the remainder of the playoffs.

====Comeback attempts and retirement (2016–2019)====
Bosh was initially optimistic about a return to the Heat for the 2016–17 season, and the organization had become increasingly hopeful that he would be cleared for camp. Those hopes quickly faded due to Bosh&#x27;s continued issues with blood clotting. In September 2016, Bosh failed his physical exam and was not cleared by the team to participate in training camp. On September 26, 2016, Heat president Pat Riley said that the team viewed Bosh&#x27;s career with the team as over. In May 2017, Bosh and the Heat reportedly reached a unique agreement in which Bosh would leave the Heat without his salary taking up the team&#x27;s salary cap space for the 2017–18 season.

On June 2, 2017, the NBA ruled that Bosh&#x27;s blood clotting issues were a career-ending illness, meaning the Heat would be allowed to remove his contract from their salary cap once they officially released him. Two days later, the Heat announced that they had waived Bosh, ending his seven-year stint with the organization. Following Bosh&#x27;s release, Heat President Pat Riley said, &quot;The number &#x27;1&#x27; will never be worn by another player and we can&#x27;t wait to someday hang his jersey in the rafters.&quot; In February 2018, Bosh declared himself on the comeback trail, having refused to rule out a return to the NBA.

=== Retirement ===
On February 12, 2019, Bosh announced that he was no longer pursuing his NBA career and that he planned to retire from the NBA when his jersey was retired by the Heat. The Heat retired Bosh&#x27;s 1 jersey on March 26, 2019, before a regular season game against the Orlando Magic. In 2024, Bosh played in Goran Dragic&#x27;s Farewell Game in Ljubljana, Slovenia.

==National team career==

Bosh&#x27;s national team career began in 2002 when he was selected as a member of the 2002 USA Basketball Junior World Championship Qualifying Team that finished with a 4–1 record and the bronze medal.

After his NBA career began, Bosh was named in March 2006 to the 2006–2008 United States men&#x27;s national basketball team program, and helped lead the team to a 5–0 record during its pre-World Championship tour. In August 2006, Bosh was named as a member of the 2006 USA World Championship Team. Together with fellow 2003 draftees Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Kirk Hinrich, this team competed in the 2006 FIBA World Championship. The team won the bronze medal, defeating former 2004 Olympic champion Argentina. Bosh was ranked sixth in field goal percentage.

Following the 2006–07 season, Bosh was named to the team that would compete in the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship. However, he sustained a foot injury and withdrew from the squad. On June 23, 2008, he was named to the team that would compete in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. During the tournament itself, Bosh operated as the main backup to center Dwight Howard as Team USA went unbeaten in all eight games en route to the gold medal, defeating Spain in the final. He averaged 9.1 points per game, and led the team in rebounds with 6.1 a game.

In June 2012, Bosh withdrew his name from consideration for the 2012 Olympics in London to recover from a lower abdominal strain that kept him out of some playoff games.

==Player profile==
Bosh traditionally played the power forward position, including during his first season with the Miami Heat. However, starting in the 2011–12 season, he began to start at center and played the position during the team&#x27;s consecutive championships. Listed at and , Bosh possessed excellent speed, athleticism, and ball handling for a player of his size. Bosh was particularly noted for his ability to drive to the basket and finish strong or get to the free throw line—where he was also proficient, but he was also known for his well-developed jump shot. Indiana Pacers coach Jim O&#x27;Brien once commented on the match-up problems Bosh posed for opposing defenders: &quot;We&#x27;ve tried over the years to put big guys on him. It doesn&#x27;t work. We&#x27;ve tried to put small guys on him. It doesn&#x27;t seem to work either. I don&#x27;t know if we have somebody to play Bosh, to tell you the truth.&quot; When he was the centerpiece of the Raptors&#x27; offense, Bosh was often double teamed, and he was noted to unselfishly pass the ball to teammates who were in better shooting positions. Bosh improved his shooting range when he worked on his three-point shooting during the summer of 2006 and showed improvement in the 2006–07 season. On November 8, 2006, against the Philadelphia 76ers, Bosh hit a game-winning three-point shot with 6.1 seconds left. It was reminiscent of the shot that marked his &quot;arrival&quot; to the NBA in his first season, when Bosh hit a game-tying three-pointer against Houston to send the game to overtime. When the 2006–07 season ended, Bosh had shot .343 from the three-point arc for the season; he improved to .400 the following season. Because of his ability to hit three-pointers, it was during his tenure with the Heat that Bosh began to be relied upon as one of the team&#x27;s outside shooters, taking multiple three-pointers throughout the 2012 and 2013 championship runs. During the 2013–14 season, Bosh shot and made more three-pointers than at any point during his career, and continued to make crucial shots during the playoffs.

Bosh was noted for his leadership. When he was the leader of the Raptors, Bosh was not known for being vocal on the court, preferring to maintain his quiet and humble demeanor but expecting his teammates to match his work ethic. However, Bosh was also known to deliver stern rebukes to teammates who made bad calls on the court. Throughout his career, comparisons were made between Bosh and Kevin Garnett due to their similar style of play and physique.

==Off the court==

Besides his on-the-court exploits, Bosh was a National Honor Society member and graduated with honors from Lincoln. He is also a member of the National Society of Black Engineers and the Dallas Association of Minority Engineers. Following his success in the NBA, Bosh soon had his own YouTube channel, and has since made various TV appearances. In December 2009, &quot;First Ink&quot;, a DVD featuring comedic digital shorts and a documentary about Bosh, was released. The DVD was filmed during the summer of 2009. A fan of the &quot;X-Men&quot; television series as a child, Bosh voiced the Marvel Comics character Heimdall in an episode of &quot;Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.&quot; in 2014. He also made appearances on episodes of &quot;Entourage, Jessie&quot;&quot;,&quot; and &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;.

In the field of philanthropy, Bosh established the Chris Bosh Foundation in 2004. Remembering the challenges he had faced as a youth, Bosh founded the organization to help younger people in academics and athletics. The Foundation, with programs in Toronto and Dallas, has worked closely with organizations such as the Toronto Special Olympics to raise important funding for community projects. Bosh&#x27;s mother, Freida, has served as CEO of the Foundation. As an avid reader, Bosh also regularly speaks to groups of children about the benefits of reading, and has received the NBA Community Assist Award for his active contributions for the Raptors community development program in Toronto and Dallas during the course of the NBA campaign. In November 2008, Bosh pledged to donate $75,000 to the Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada. He is also an advocate for increased computer literacy in schools, supporting the non-profit code.org.

On April 9, 2011, Bosh married Adrienne Williams. They renewed their vows on July 16, 2011. The couple have three sons and two daughters.

Bosh has dabbled in hip-hop production. In 2017, alongside record producer, songwriter, and singer Rico Love, Bosh co-produced a song titled &quot;Miss My Woe&quot; by Gucci Mane. The song is featured on Gucci&#x27;s 11th studio album titled, &quot;Mr. Davis&quot;.

In June 2021, Bosh published his book, &quot;Letters to a Young Athlete.&quot;

===Paternity lawsuit===
On March 24, 2009, it was reported that Bosh&#x27;s former girlfriend, Allison Mathis, was seeking child support and sole custody of their daughter, Trinity (born November 2, 2008). Mathis alleged that when she was seven months pregnant, Bosh stopped supporting her financially and tried to remove her from their home. Three days later, it was reported that the dispute was only over the amount Bosh paid. Mathis&#x27; lawyer also told the press, &quot;My client very much wanted this dispute to remain private. Certainly this thing did not get started by anything on our side... She is very distressed that somehow this thing got into the newspapers. She wants Trinity to have a good relationship with her dad, Chris Bosh, and adverse publicity makes that more difficult.&quot;

<doc id="537683" wikidata="Q335" url="?curid=537683" title="Patricio Aylwin">
<text>Patricio Aylwin Azócar (; 26 November 1918 – 19 April 2016) was a Chilean politician from the Christian Democratic Party, lawyer, author, professor and former senator. He was the 30th president of Chile and the first president to be elected after the absolute rule of dictator Augusto Pinochet, and his election marked the Chilean transition to democracy in 1990. 

Despite resistance from elements of the Chilean military and government after his election, Aylwin was staunch in his support for the Chilean National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation which exposed the systematic brutalities of the dictatorship.

== Early life ==
Aylwin, the eldest of the five children of Miguel Aylwin and Laura Azócar, was born in Viña del Mar. An excellent student, he enrolled in the Law School of the University of Chile where he became a lawyer, with the highest distinction, in 1943. He served as professor of administrative law, first at the University of Chile (1946–1967) and also at the School of Law of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile (1952–1960). He was also professor of civic education and political economy at the National Institute (1946–1963). His brother, Andrés, was also a politician.

On 29 September 1948, he was married to Leonor Oyarzún Ivanovic. They had five children (his daughter Mariana worked as a minister in subsequent governments) and 14 grandchildren (among them, popular telenovela and film actress Paz Bascuñán).

==Political career==
Aylwin&#x27;s involvement in politics started in 1945, when he joined the Falange Nacional. Later he was elected president of the Falange in 1950–51. When that party became the Christian Democratic Party of Chile, he served seven terms as its president between 1958 and 1989.

In 1965 he was elected to the National Congress as a Senator. In 1971, he became the president of the Senate. During the government of Popular Unity, headed by Salvador Allende, he was also the president of his party, and he led the democratic opposition to Allende within and without Congress. He is credited, to some degree, with trying to find a peaceful solution to the country&#x27;s political crisis. Distrusting Allende, Aylwin &quot;demanded that the president appoint only military men to his cabinet as proof of his honest intent,&quot; which Allende did only partially, and Aylwin &quot;apparently sided with pro-coup forces, believing that the military would restore democracy to the nation.&quot; He stated very plainly that between &quot;a Marxist dictatorship and a dictatorship of our military, I would choose the second.&quot;

Aylwin was president of the Christian Democrats until 1976, and after the death of the party&#x27;s leader, Eduardo Frei, in 1982, he led his party during the military dictatorship. Later he helped establish the Constitutional Studies Group of 24 to reunite the country&#x27;s democratic sectors against the dictatorship. In 1979 he served as a spokesman in the group that opposed the plebiscite that approved a new constitution.

In 1982, Aylwin was elected vice president of the Christian Democrats. He was among the first to advocate acceptance of the Constitution as a reality in order to facilitate the return to democracy. 

On 5 October 1988, the Chilean national plebiscite was held. A &quot;Yes&quot; vote would grant Pinochet eight more years as president. Despite the widespread expectation that Pinochet would be voted an extended term, the &quot;No&quot; campaign triumphed, in part because of a superb media campaign depicted in the 2012 film &quot;No&quot;. Patricio Aylwin was at the center of the movement that defeated General Pinochet. After the plebiscite, he participated in negotiations that led the government and the opposition to agree on 54 constitutional reforms, thereby making possible a peaceful transition from 16 years of dictatorship to democracy.

== Presidency ==

===Domestic policy===
Patricio Aylwin was elected president of the Republic on 14 December 1989.

Although Chile had officially become a democracy, the Chilean military led by Pinochet remained highly powerful during the presidency of Aylwin, and the Constitution ensured the continued influence of Pinochet and his commanders, which prevented his government from achieving many of the goals it had set, such as the restructuring of the Constitutional Court and the reduction of Pinochet&#x27;s political power. His administration, however, initiated direct municipal elections, the first of which were held in June 1992. In spite of the severe limits imposed on Aylwin&#x27;s government by the Constitution, over four years, it &quot;altered power relations in its favor in the state, in civil society, and in political society&quot;. Pinochet was determined that the military not be punished for its role in overthrowing Allende&#x27;s government or for the years of military dictatorship. Aylwin did attempt to bring to justice those in the military who committed abuses.

===Economic policy===
The Aylwin Government did much to reduce poverty and inequality during its time in office. A tax reform was introduced in 1990 which boosted tax revenues by around 15% and enabled the Aylwin Government to increase government spending on social programs from 9.9% to 11.7% of GDP. By the end of the Aylwin government, unprecedented resources were being allocated to social programs, including an expanded public health programs, vocational and training programs for young Chileans, and a major public housing initiative.

A new Solidarity and Social Investment Fund was set up to direct aid towards poorer communities, and social spending (especially on health and education) increased by around one-third between 1989 and 1993. A new labor law was also enacted in 1990, which expanded trade union rights and collective bargaining while also improving severance pay for workers. The minimum wage was also increased, as were family allowances, pensions, and other benefits. Between 1990 and 1993, real wages grew by 4.6%, while the unemployment rate fell from 7.8% to 6.5%. Spending on education increased by 40% while spending on health increased by 54%. The incomes of poor Chileans increased by 20% in real terms (above the rate of inflation) under the Aylwin Government, while increases to the minimum wage meant that it was 36% higher in real terms in 1993 than in 1990. A slum clearance program was also initiated, with over 100,000 new homes built under the Aylwin Government, compared with 40,000 per annum under the Pinochet Government.

Under the Aylwin government, the numbers of Chileans living in poverty significantly decreased, with a United Nations report estimating that the percentage of the population living in poverty had fallen from around 40% of the population in 1989 to around 33% by 1993.

===End===
He was succeeded in 1994 by the election of Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, the son of the late President Eduardo Frei Montalva.

== Personal life ==

=== British ancestry ===
Aylwin was of British descent through his paternal lineage. The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) commissioned Timothy Duke to research into Aylwin’s heritage prior to a state visit in April 1991. They found that his great-grandfather, Richard Aylwin (who later changed his name to Ricardo Aylwin), was an Englishman born in Southwark, England, to tallow chandlers and emigrated to Chile in 1833. Aylwin had spent most of his life thinking he was of Welsh descent and had initially planned a trip to Cardiff as part of the official United Kingdom visit following his presidential election.

The FCO had also found that further down his lineage, his ancestors were yeoman farmers in Sussex, where Aylwin is quite a common surname. Duke described Aylwin&#x27;s British ancestry as &quot;well established&quot; and accompanied him during his state visit to the villages of Treyford and Didling in Sussex, where Aylwin visited the graves of his ancestors and met relatives. Duke stated that Aylwin “didn’t speak English so we had an interpreter, but he was delighted with the reception he got in Sussex,” and that “He just seemed delighted to be back in a county from which his forebears had come and to discover the truth.”

Aylwin was a descendant of Henry fitz Ailwin the first Lord Mayor of London.

==Post-presidency==
Aylwin was president of the Corporation for Democracy and Justice, a non-profit organization he founded to develop approaches to eliminating poverty and to strengthen ethical values in politics.

Aylwin received honorary degrees from universities in Australia, Canada, Colombia, France, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Spain, and the United States, as well as seven Chilean universities. In 1997, the Council of Europe awarded the North-South Prize to Aylwin and Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland, for their contributions to fostering human rights, democracy, and cooperation between Europe and Latin America.

== Death ==

On 18 December 2015, Aylwin was hospitalized in Santiago after suffering a cranial injury at home. He died on 19 April 2016, aged 97 from natural causes from respiratory insufficiency.

His state funeral was held on 22 April 2016 and was buried at Cementerio General de Santiago in the following days.

<doc id="537694" wikidata="Q3245641" url="?curid=537694" title="List of pornographic actors who appeared in mainstream films">
<text>Since the 1970s, there have been a number of adult film actors who have appeared in mainstream films with varying degrees of success. Adult film actors Marilyn Chambers and Linda Lovelace tried crossing over to mainstream careers in the 1970s, but had little success. Chambers did work with David Cronenberg in 1977&#x27;s horror film &quot;Rabid&quot;, which went on to achieve cult success. Former adult film star Traci Lords appeared in John Waters&#x27; films &quot;Cry-Baby&quot; and &quot;Serial Mom&quot;, and Lords also appeared in the comedy film &quot;Zack and Miri Make a Porno&quot;. The gay pornographic star Johnny Hazzard more recently appeared in the mainstream gay drama &quot;Tiger Orange&quot;.

Jenna Jameson played a radio guest in the Howard Stern biopic &quot;Private Parts&quot;, while Sasha Grey was the female lead in &quot;The Girlfriend Experience&quot;. In 2013, James Deen played the male lead in &quot;The Canyons&quot;, an indie film written by Bret Easton Ellis, with Lindsay Lohan playing the female lead.

The following list is of [[pornographic film actor|pornographic actors]] who have appeared in non-pornographic films, including the year they first appeared in a mainstream film.

<text>The Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT) is a public polytechnic and applied sciences institute in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

NAIT offers approximately 120 credit programs leading to degrees, applied degrees, diplomas, and certificates. As of 2023, there are approximately 15,700 students enrolled in credit programs, 7,009 apprentices registered in apprenticeship training, 12,100 students enrolled in non-credit courses, and more than 20,000 registrants for customized corporate based training. NAIT also attracts international students from 84 countries. NAIT is similar to an institute of technology or university of applied sciences as termed in other jurisdictions. The campus newspaper, the &quot;NAIT Nugget&quot;, is a member of the Canadian University Press (CUP).

==Academic programs==
The polytechnic confers certificates, diplomas, applied degrees and baccalaureate degrees. NAIT&#x27;s four-year baccalaureate degrees (Bachelor of Technology in Technology Management and Bachelor of Technology in Construction Management and Bachelor of Business Administration) were launched in 2007.

NAIT is one of the largest apprenticeship trainers in Canada offering 31 registered trades programs.

==History==
In 1959, the Alberta provincial government decided to build an Edmonton facility to supplement apprenticeship and vocational training, which was at the time handled by the Provincial Institute of Technology and Art (PITA) in Calgary. The new institution would be named the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT) and PITA would be renamed the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT). Construction of the new facility began in January 1962. The first class was enrolled in October, a group of 29 Communication Electrician apprentices. NAIT officially opened on May 27, 1963, with a ceremony led by Premier Ernest Manning. The first graduation ceremony happened in 1965, with a class of 326 graduates. In 1982, the government transferred control to the new Board of Governors, chaired by Allan McCagherty. NAIT has been a leading polytechnic for more than 60 years. The school marked its 50th anniversary in 2012.

==Campuses==
The institute has four campuses located in Edmonton and Spruce Grove:
* Main campus at 11762 - 106 Street, Edmonton
* Patricia campus at 12204 - 149 Street, Edmonton
* Souch (pronounced “such”) campus at 7110 Gateway Boulevard, Edmonton
* Spruce Grove campus at 281 Tamarack Drive, Spruce Grove

In February 2019, the Main campus acquired of the former Edmonton City Centre Airport with the option for another , as well as the Westwood Transit Garage to the north. This will enable the closure of the Patricia and Souch campuses, and the construction of a student residence building. The Spruce Grove campus will remain open since its crane and hoisting classes cannot be accommodated at the Main campus.

==Mascot==
NAIT&#x27;s mascot is the Ook. This is a shortened version of ookpik, the Inuktitut word for the snowy owl. NAIT was presented this mascot in 1964 by the federal Department of Northern Affairs and National Resources, now Crown–Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada. Most of NAIT&#x27;s sports teams are now called the Ooks as well.

==Athletics==
The NAIT Ooks compete in the Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association as a member of the Alberta Colleges Athletics Conference. Ooks team sports include badminton, basketball, curling, ice hockey, soccer, and volleyball. NAIT&#x27;s official team colours are gold and royal blue.

Irwin Strifler was the Athletic Director from 1968 to 1998.

==Students&#x27; association==

The NAIT Students&#x27; Association (NAITSA) is composed entirely of current NAIT students. It is led by a four-person elected Executive Council, and governed by an eighteen-person elected Senate (two representatives from the 9 program groups). NAITSA is responsible for running the Nest Taphouse Grill, The &quot;NAIT Nugget&quot; (campus newspaper), campus events, the student health and dental plan, U-Pass and various other services aimed at enhancing student life.

==&quot;Techlifetoday&quot; magazine==
&quot;Techlifetoday&quot; is the polytechnic&#x27;s official magazine, focusing on people, technology and innovation. It launched in 2007 as &quot;techlife&quot;, a print magazine. &quot;Techlifetoday&quot; has published exclusively online since November 2018 and has earned numerous industry awards.

== Organization and administration ==
NAIT&#x27;s credit programs are organized into seven academic schools and Corporate &amp; Continuing Education. The schools are:
* JR Shaw School of Business

<text>Stanford Shopping Center is an upscale open air shopping mall located on Route 82 (El Camino Real) at Sand Hill Road in Palo Alto, California. It is on the campus of Stanford University although the university only owns the land and not the actual buildings or stores. Also, unlike the main academic campus, the shopping center and the neighboring Stanford University Medical Center are part of the city of Palo Alto, not the census-designated place (CDP) of Stanford, California. The shopping center buildings are 94.4% owned by Simon Property Group, which manages the property and leases the land from the university.

The outdoor center is and includes four major department stores: Bloomingdale&#x27;s, Macy&#x27;s, Neiman Marcus, and Nordstrom. Retailers at the shopping center include Louis Vuitton, Tiffany &amp; Co., Burberry, Ermenegildo Zegna, and Frette, as well as the first Victoria&#x27;s Secret retail store.

==History==

In 1954, excavators broke ground on what was once Leland Stanford&#x27;s vineyards. Nine buildings housing 45 businesses were built. The Roos Brothers clothing store opened as the first retailer in September 1955 and Blum&#x27;s restaurant opened on October 22, 1956, marking the completion of the center. Board of trustees Chair Lloyd Dinkelspiel and university President J. E. Wallace Sterling presided at the opening and Shirley Temple Black cut the first slice of a nine-tiered cake. San Francisco department store The Emporium and luxury specialty department store I. Magnin &amp; Co. were the original anchors.

The center opened with great success and became one of the largest sources of unrestricted income for the university.

Macy&#x27;s California joined the center in 1961 and Saks Fifth Avenue opened a store in 1962. Further expansion came again in 1972 with the addition of Los Angeles-based Bullock&#x27;s, owned by Bloomingdale&#x27;s parent company Federated Department Stores. Bullock&#x27;s only lasted 11 years, closing its northern California stores in 1983 and selling its Stanford location to Nordstrom, which opened in November 1984. Neiman Marcus became the sixth anchor in August 1985.

A department store shuffle occurred in the mid-1990s:

*Saks Fifth Avenue closed in 1994.
*I. Magnin was rebranded as a Macy&#x27;s Men&#x27;s store in 1995.
*The Emporium store was shuttered and rebranded as Bloomingdale&#x27;s in November 1996.

In 1997, the vacant Saks Fifth Avenue building was split into two tenants: Crate &amp; Barrel and an Andronico&#x27;s gourmet market. Andronico&#x27;s closed in 2011, and was replaced by The Container Store in 2013.

On March 18, 2020, Stanford was among 7 Bay-area malls owned by the Simon Property Group which closed until March 29, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Later years==
Throughout the years, the center has continued to evolve in terms of both tenants and construction and was managed by the university through its investment affiliate Stanford Management Company since 1991. However, in 2003, taking advantage of the high prices that shopping centers were fetching, the university&#x27;s board of trustees agreed to sell the center for $333 million to Simon Property Group which, in turn, leases the underlying land from the university under a 51-year lease. The university&#x27;s lease includes an annual rent equal to 25% percent of the center&#x27;s net profits.

In 2012, Bloomingdale&#x27;s announced plans to move into a new three-level 120,000 square foot store, vacating its existing building. The new Bloomingdale&#x27;s opened in 2014, and the original building was demolished to make way for a new wing of retailers. That new wing, anchored by a multi-level Anthropologie store and a True Food Kitchen restaurant, opened in mid-2016.

In early 2019, Simon Property Group submitted plans to the city of Palo Alto to tear down the former Macy&#x27;s Men&#x27;s building and replace it with a 40,000 square-foot, three-level RH gallery with a rooftop restaurant, a duo of smaller restaurant buildings, and a new, larger 29,000 square-foot Wilkes Bashford store. The project was approved in late 2019, with demolition commencing in 2021 and continuing into 2021.

<text>Harrison McCain (3 November 1927 – 18 March 2004) was a Canadian businessman and co-founder, along with his three brothers, of international frozen foods giant McCain Foods.

== Early life ==
McCain was born in Florenceville-Bristol, New Brunswick, as the son of Andrew Davis McCain, a descendant of a settler from Castlefinn, County Donegal, Ireland who became a well-respected seed potato farmer. Since 1900, the family sold seed potatoes throughout New Brunswick and exported to Cuba and Latin America.

== Career ==
After graduating from Acadia University, Harrison (the 3rd son) and his brother Wallace (the 4th son) worked for oil and gas company Irving Oil. In 1956, on their brother Robert suggestions, Harrison and Wallace with their brothers Robert and Andrew founded one of the first factories to process potatoes, turning them into frozen french fries. With the benefit of ensured quality and the ability to export long distances with a value added product, the business started growing. With Harrison&#x27;s personal and business skills and the close relationship with his brother Wallace, the McCain Foods business eventually grew to over 55 factories worldwide and the number one french fry company in the world. In the 1990s a prolonged legal dispute between Harrison and Wallace over succession to the company leadership led to the departure of Wallace and his son Michael from McCain Foods. Harrison named his nephew, Allison McCain, son of his late brother Andrew, as his successor in 2002.

=== Ventures ===
McCain was a member of the board of directors of the Bank of Nova Scotia and a close personal friend of the bank&#x27;s chairman Cedric Ritchie who grew up in the neighboring community of Upper Kent.

== Canadian honours ==
In 1992, he was named to the Order of Canada as a companion, the highest degree.

== Personal life ==
He is father to Gillian McCain co-author (with Legs McNeil) of &quot;Please Kill Me: The Oral History of Punk&quot; (Grove Press, 1996) as well as two volumes of poetry, &quot;Tilt&quot; (Hard Press, 1997) and &quot;Religion&quot; (The Figures, 1999). He was married to Marion &quot;Billie&quot; McCain, daughter of the former premier of New Brunswick John McNair.

He died of kidney failure in Boston, Massachusetts, on 18 March 2004.

<doc id="537715" wikidata="Q2516194" url="?curid=537715" title="Tibetan rug">
<text>Tibetan rug making is an ancient, traditional craft. Tibetan rugs are traditionally made from Tibetan highland sheep&#x27;s wool, called &quot;changpel&quot;. Tibetans use rugs for many purposes ranging from flooring to wall hanging to horse saddles, though the most common use is as a seating carpet. A typical sleeping carpet measuring around is called a &quot;khaden&quot;.

The knotting method used in Tibetan rug making is different from that used in other rug making traditions worldwide. Some aspects of the rug making have been supplanted by cheaper machines in recent times, especially yarn spinning and trimming of the pile after weaving. However, some carpets are still made by hand. The Tibetan diaspora in India and Nepal have established a thriving business in rug making. In Nepal the rug business is one of the largest industries in the country and there are many rug exporters. Tibet also has weaving workshops, but the export side of the industry is relatively undeveloped compared with Nepal and India.

==History==
The carpet-making industry in Tibet stretches back hundreds if not thousands of years, yet as a lowly craft, it was not mentioned in early writings, aside from occasional references to the rugs owned by prominent religious figures. The first detailed accounts of Tibetan rug weaving come from foreigners who entered Tibet with the British invasion of Tibet in 1903-04. Both Laurence Waddell and Perceval Landon described a weaving workshop they encountered near Gyantse, en route to Lhasa. Landon records &quot;a courtyard entirely filled with the weaving looms of both men and women workers&quot; making rugs which he described as &quot;beautiful things&quot;. The workshop was owned and run by one of the local aristocratic families, which was the norm in premodern Tibet. Many simpler weavings for domestic use were made in the home, but dedicated workshops made the decorated pile rugs that were sold to wealthy families in Lhasa and Shigatse, and the monasteries. The monastic institutions housed thousands of monks, who sat on long, low platforms during religious ceremonies, that were nearly always covered in hand-woven carpets for comfort. Wealthier monasteries replaced these carpets regularly, providing income, or taking gifts in lieu of taxation, from hundreds or thousands of weavers.

From its heyday in the 19th and early 20th century, the Tibetan carpet industry fell into serious decline in the second half of the 20th. The illegal Chinese invasion of Tibet that began in 1959 was later exacerbated by land collectivization that enabled rural people to obtain a livelihood without weaving, and reduced the power of the landholding monasteries. Many of the aristocratic families who formerly organized the weaving fled to India and Nepal during this period, along with their money and management expertise.

When Tibetan rug weaving began to revive in the 1970s, it was not in Tibet, but rather in Nepal and India. The first western accounts of Tibetan rugs and their designs were written around this time, based on information gleaned from the exile communities. Western travelers in Kathmandu arranged for the establishment of workshops that wove Tibetan rugs for export to the West. Weaving in the Nepal and India carpet workshops was eventually dominated by local non-Tibetan workers, who replaced the original Tibetan émigré weavers. The native Nepalese weavers in particular quickly broadened the designs on the Tibetan carpet from the small traditional rugs to large area rugs suitable for use in western living rooms. This began a carpet industry that is important to the Nepalese economy even to this day, even though its reputation was eventually tarnished by child labor scandals during the 1990s.

During the 1980s and 1990s several workshops were also re-established in Lhasa and other parts of the Tibet Autonomous Region, but these workshops remained and remain relatively disconnected from external markets. Today, most carpets woven in Lhasa factories are destined for the tourist market or for use as gifts to visiting Chinese delegations and government departments. Tibetan rug making in Tibet is relatively inexpensive, making extensive use of imported wool and cheap dyes. Some luxury rug makers have found success in Tibet in the last decade, but a gap still exists between Tibet-made product and the &quot;Tibetan style&quot; rugs made in South Asia.

==Design==
Tibetan carpets from the 19th century (perhaps earlier, though mostly carpets from the 19th century survive) are relatively restrained in terms of design and coloring, carpet makers at that time being restricted to a narrow range of natural dyes including madder (red), indigo (blue), Tibetan rhubarb (yellow) and Tibetan walnut (browns and greys), with a few other local plants producing yellow and greenish colors. Motifs consisted of two classes: the first type being simple geometric motifs such as the checkerboard and gau (amulet) design that probably formed part of an ancient Tibetan design repertoire, mingled with medallion designs and other motifs derived from Chinese decorative traditions.

From the early 1900s a wider range of synthetic colors became available to Tibetan weavers, and this seems to have stimulated the production of new and more complex designs, also based loosely on traditional Chinese motifs. The period of 1900-1950 saw the production of many colorful new designs featuring dragons, phoenix, floral motifs, clouds and so on. Though the main influence was Chinese, Western textile designs were also copied occasionally. These designs still form the core of the Tibetan weaver&#x27;s repertoire today.

==Tiger rugs==

The interest of western collectors of Tibetan rugs was particularly piqued by tiger rugs, in part because of their associations with Tantric meditation; many Tibetan tiger rugs were gifts for lamas in the monasteries.

There are several kinds of Tibetan tiger rug designs. Some consist of &quot;realistic&quot; renderings of tiger pelts, while closely related rugs show more abstracted versions of tiger stripes. Another type of tiger rug shows a &quot;whole pelt&quot;, complete with legs and grinning face.

In a religious context, tiger rugs are related to the tiger skin loin cloths seen in painted images of fierce (wrathful) Tibetan Buddhist gods. The tiger skin is believed to provide protection to a person engaged in meditation. Female wrathful gods sport snow leopard spot loin cloths, and old Tibetan rugs are occasionally found with leopard spots too.

Tiger design rugs are found in several other carpet cultures, including Khotan rugs to the north, however it is amongst Tibetan weavers that these designs achieve their highest development. The designs are lively and amongst the most original of all traditional Tibetan motifs.

==Wangden rugs==
Many Wangden rugs have a looser weave, lower knot count, and a thicker pile than a typical Tibetan carpet, and also sport a thick shaggy fringe. Today these rugs are woven only in the Wangden valley, in the region south of Shigatse, though their manufacture may have been more widespread at one time.

This type of rug was originally made for monastic use as a sitting carpet. Some monasteries still have long Wangden runners on the bench seats used by monks during ceremonies. New rugs are still being woven, though mainly for domestic use and for the visitor market in Lhasa.

The Wangden rug has also been reinterpreted in a contemporary way by Bartoli Design for the Nodus collections.

==Present Day Production in Tibet==
In Lhasa, rug stores cater to both to local, national, and international tourists. Dark red Turkish imitations from factories in Qinghai are sold alongside other Chinese rugs and even silk carpets with Middle-eastern designs. Amongst local Tibetans, replicas of traditional Tibetan designs from machine-woven polyester are popular inexpensive alternatives to hand-made carpets.

Government-sponsored workshops target the tourist and &quot;official delegation gift&quot; markets, but the wools have short staples and make carpets that are more likely to shed fluff and become matted after cleaning. A popular design is the &quot;Potala&quot; rug, featuring a picture of the Potala Palace and intended to be hung on the wall. Carpet workshops founded by foreigners use wool with longer staple lengths and high lanolin content, which make for a stronger content, but are much more expensive, and have not found much success. However, as an economic activity, Tibetan rug making provides valuable cash income for rural communities who weave in the winter months. Several overseas investors and NGOs are trying to encourage a revival of high quality local wool and natural dyes in Tibetan rug making.

<text>Ibrahim Rugova (; 2 December 1944 – 21 January 2006) was a Kosovo-Albanian politician, scholar, and writer, who served as the President of the partially recognised Republic of Kosova, serving from 1992 to 2000 and as President of Kosovo from 2002 until his death in 2006. He oversaw a popular struggle for independence, advocating a peaceful resistance to Yugoslav rule and lobbying for U.S. and European support, especially during the Kosovo War.

He founded the political party Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) in 1989. The LDK, which had the support of 90% of the ethnic Albanian population of Kosovo, advocated for Kosovo&#x27;s independence by peaceful means. The party established a shadow government that provided basic government and social services to the Kosovo Albanian population, including education and health care, in effect creating a parallel state. In May 1992, Rugova was elected President of this parallel state. In March 2002, with a United Nations mission was administering Kosovo, he was elected President of Kosovo. He held this position until his death in January 2006, and was posthumously declared a Hero of Kosovo. He is sometimes referred to as &quot;Ati Kombit&quot; (&quot;Father of the Nation&quot;) in Kosovo. He is also referred to as the &quot;Gandhi of the Balkans&quot; due to his strategy of non-violent resistance.

==Family and early life==
Ibrahim Rugova was born on 2 December 1944 to a family that is a branch of the Kelmendi Albanian clan. At this time, the major part of Kosovo was unified with Albania (controlled by Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Italy since 1941, and later by the Germans from 1943). Yugoslav control was re-established towards the end of November 1944 when the area was liberated by the Bulgarian Army and Yugoslav partisans who defeated Albanian collaborators. His father Ukë Rugova and his paternal grandfather Rrustë Rugova were summarily executed in January 1945 by Yugoslav communists. Rugova finished primary school in Burim and high school in Peja, graduating in 1967.

He strongly emphasized the heritage of ancient Dardania, an independent kingdom and later-turned Roman province that included modern-day Kosovo, to strengthen the country&#x27;s identity and to promote his policy of closer relations with the West. He studied literature at the University of Prishtina and the University of Paris, and received a doctorate with a dissertation on Albanian literary criticism. As a student, he participated in a civil rights movement for the Albanians and formally joined the Communist League of Yugoslavia. Thereby, he worked as editor of prestigious literary and scholarly publications and research fellow at the Institute of Albanian Studies; in 1988, he was elected president of the Kosovo Writers Union.

He moved on to the newly established University of Prishtina, where he was a student in the Faculty of Philosophy, Department of Albanian Studies and participated in the 1968 Kosovo Protests. He graduated in 1971 and re-enrolled as a research student concentrating on literary theory. As part of his studies, he spent two years (1976–1977) at the École Pratique des Hautes Études of the University of Paris, where he studied under Roland Barthes. He received his doctorate in 1984 after delivering his thesis, &quot;The Directions and Premises of Albanian Literary Criticism, 1504–1983&quot;.

Rugova was active as a journalist throughout the 1970s, editing the student newspaper &quot;Bota e Re&quot; (&quot;New World&quot;) and the magazine &quot;Dituria&quot; (&quot;Knowledge&quot;). He also worked in the Institute for Albanian Studies in Prishtina, where he became the editor-in-chief of its periodical, &quot;Gjurmime albanologjike&quot; (&quot;Albanian Research&quot;). He formally joined the Yugoslav Communist Party during this period. Rugova managed to make a name for himself, publishing a number of works on literary theory, criticism and history as well as his own poetry. His output earned him recognition as a leading member of Kosovo&#x27;s Albanian intelligentsia and in 1988 he was elected chairman of the Kosovo Writers&#x27; Union (KWU).

===Personal life===
Rugova was married to Fana Rugova and had three children.

==Presidency==
As president, Rugova continued to support his non-violent path to independence even as proponents of an armed resistance formed the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) to counter increasing Serbian oppression on the ethnic Albanians. In 1998, Rugova secured a second term as president, but was placed at odds with the KLA as the Kosovo War broke out. In 1999, he participated in the failed Rambouillet talks, as a member of the Kosovar delegation, seeking an end to the hostilities. Having resided in the capital Prishtina during his entire presidency, Rugova was taken prisoner by the state authorities after NATO began its U.S.-led aerial campaign against Yugoslav forces in Kosovo. Rugova was exiled to Rome in May 1999 and returned to Kosovo in the summer of that year, shortly after the end of the war.

Rugova remained nominal president of the republic with Bujar Bukoshi as his Prime Minister; meanwhile, Hashim Thaçi, a former KLA commander, had been leading a provisional government since April that year. Effective power, however, was in the hands of the United Nations administration. In 2000, Rugova and Thaçi agreed to relinquish their positions and to work on creating provisional institutions of self-government until Kosovo&#x27;s final status was decided. Rugova was elected president of Kosovo by the newly formed parliament in 2002 and again in 2005. While his pre-war popularity had certainly diminished, he remained the most powerful leader in the country until his death from lung cancer in 2006.

==Political career==
Rugova entered politics in 1989, when he assumed the leadership of the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), a newly formed political party that opposed the nullification of Kosovo&#x27;s autonomy in the former Yugoslavia. In 1992, Rugova won the first presidential election in the Republic of Kosova, an unrecognised state declared in secret by members of Kosovo&#x27;s former assembly within Yugoslavia. Serbia, led by Slobodan Milošević, retained effective power in Kosovo throughout most of the 1990s, but did not secure the full cooperation of the Albanian population. The Republic of Kosova collected donations from Kosovars at home and abroad and set up parallel institutions, including independent, albeit often clandestine, educational and healthcare systems for the ethnic Albanians.

The 1980s saw escalating tension within Kosovo with dissatisfaction by Serbs regarding their treatment at the hands of the Kosovan authorities, and resentment from those same authorities towards the lack of powers devolved to them from Belgrade, Yugoslavia&#x27;s capital. Since 1974, the Socialist Republic of Serbia&#x27;s local authority had no constitutional rule over Kosovo. In 1989, unilateral measures taken by Serbian President Milošević shattered Kosovo&#x27;s autonomy by reverting it to its pre-1974 status. A harsh system was imposed, leading to widespread violations of human rights and the repression of dissenters. An estimated 130,000 Kosovo Albanians were sacked from their jobs and the police in particular were almost completely purged of Albanians. There were numerous reports of extrajudicial beatings, torture and killings, attracting strong criticism from human rights groups and other countries.

Milošević&#x27;s actions were strongly opposed by the Kosovo-Albanian political élite (including the local Communist Party now stripped of authorities), by ethnic Albanians and by Milošević&#x27;s counterparts in Yugoslavia&#x27;s other republics. Members of the abolished Kosovo assembly met to declare an independent Kosovo, the Republic of Kosova, which was recognised by Albania. The local Serbian government responded by arresting 112 of the 120 members of the assembly and six members of the Kosovo government and charging them with &quot;counter-revolutionary activity.&quot; Journalists who reported the assembly&#x27;s declaration were also detained and imprisoned. Kosovo&#x27;s intellectuals also opposed the changes; Rugova was one of 215 signatories of the &quot;Appeal of Kosovo Intellectuals&quot; against Milošević&#x27;s decision to change Kosovo&#x27;s status. He was immediately expelled from the Communist Party in retaliation.

In December 1989, Rugova and a number of other dissents set up the Democratic League of Kosovo as a vehicle for opposing Milošević&#x27;s policies. Rugova became leader after the first candidate, Rexhep Qosja, a prominent nationalist writer, refused the job. The new party was an overwhelming success and within months, 700,000 people – virtually the entire adult population of Kosovo Albanians – had joined. The LDK established a &quot;shadow government&quot; and a &quot;Parallel Social System&quot; to provide education and health services to the Albanian population, which was either excluded from or chose not to use the equivalent services provided by the Serbian government. An underground Kosovo Assembly was founded with Bujar Bukoshi acting as Prime Minister from the safe distance of Germany. The shadow government&#x27;s activities were mostly funded by the overseas Kosovo Albanian diaspora, based primarily in Germany and the United States. However, Rugova&#x27;s government was recognised officially only by the government of Albania.

The Kosovo-Albanians boycotted Yugoslav and Serbian elections on the grounds that they would legitimise the Milošević government, they also questioned its veracity. In May 1992, separate elections were held in Kosovo in which Rugova won an overwhelming majority and was elected President of Kosovo. Although there were questions about the fairness and propriety of the elections – they were held virtually in secret in Albanians&#x27; houses, there were repeated reports of harassment by state security forces, and there were allegations of vote-rigging – it was nonetheless generally accepted that Rugova was the legitimate winner of this election.

In 1991 the Yugoslav wars began following Slovenia and Croatia declaring themselves independent from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. By the summer of 1992, Yugoslavia was fully absorbed with the wars in Croatia and Bosnia, and had no spare military capacity to deal with conflicts elsewhere. Rugova supported Kosovo&#x27;s independence but strongly opposed the use of force as a means of achieving it, fearing a Bosnia-style bloodbath. He instead advocated a policy of Gandhi-like passive resistance, stating on a visit to London that

:The slaughterhouse is not the only form of struggle. There is no mass humiliation in Kosovo. We are organised and are operating as a state. It is easy to take to the streets and to head towards suicide, but wisdom lies in eluding a catastrophe.

The Serbian and Yugoslav governments subjected LDK activists and members to considerable harassment and intimidation, and argued that the shadow government was an illegal organisation. However, they did not try to shut down the LDK completely and they allowed him to travel abroad. It seems likely that Milošević saw Rugova as being useful in averting an uprising in Kosovo. The Yugoslav government would have found such a situation difficult to contain at the same time as supporting simultaneous wars in Croatia and Bosnia.

For his part, Rugova stuck to a hard line throughout the 1990s, rejecting any form of negotiation with Serbia&#x27;s authorities other than on achieving outright independence of Kosovo. A compromise, or a setback in the eyes of his critics, came in 1996 when he reached an agreement with Serbia over educational facilities, under which the parallel shadow education system would not be integrated with that of Serbia.

===The slide to war===
Rugova&#x27;s strategy of passive resistance attracted widespread support from the Kosovo Albanian population, who had seen the carnage wrought in Croatia and Bosnia and was wary of facing a similar situation. However, the Dayton Agreement of 1995, which ended the Bosnian War, seriously weakened Rugova&#x27;s position. The agreement failed to make any mention of Kosovo and the international community made no serious efforts to resolve the province&#x27;s ongoing problems. Radicals among the Kosovo Albanian population began to argue that the only way to break the impasse was to launch an armed uprising, in the belief that this would force the outside world to intervene. They blamed Rugova&#x27;s policy of non-violence for Kosovo&#x27;s failure to achieve independence. On 1 September 1996, Rugova and Slobodan Milošević signed the Milošević-Rugova education agreement in an attempt to resolve issues regarding the education of Kosovo Albanian children.

In 1997, the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) emerged as a fighting force and began carrying out attacks and assassinations against Serbian civilians, paramilitia and security forces as well as Albanians deemed to be &quot;collaborators&quot;. The Serbian response was, as the KLA had predicted, forceful and often indiscriminate. By 1998, the KLA had grown into a full-scale guerrilla army, 100,000 Kosovo Albanians were refugees and the province was in a state of virtual civil war. Rugova was re-elected president in the same year and was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought by the European Parliament. However, he was by now clearly being eclipsed by the KLA. This was highlighted in February 1999 when he was passed over in favour of the KLA&#x27;s political chief Hashim Thaçi, who was chosen by the underground Kosovo Assembly to head the Kosovo Albanian negotiating team in the discussions on the aborted Rambouillet Agreement.

At the end of March 1999, after negotiations at Rambouillet had broken down, NATO launched Operation Allied Force to impose a resolution of the Kosovo War. Rugova spent the first few weeks of the war under virtual house arrest, along with his family, in Pristina. At the start of April 1999, Rugova was forcefully taken to Belgrade, where he was shown on Serbian state television meeting Milošević and calling for an end to the war.

Rugova was allowed to leave Kosovo for temporary exile in Italy in early May 1999, not long before the war ended. He attracted further criticism for his slowness to return to Kosovo – it was not until July that he arrived back in the province. Nonetheless, he received a hero&#x27;s welcome and returned to political life under the new United Nations administration in Kosovo.

===Post-war===
Despite the political damage suffered by Rugova during the war, he soon regained public esteem and won a decisive victory against his political rivals in the KLA. The guerrillas had been welcomed as liberators by Kosovo Albanians but subsequently alienated many by the perception that they were engaging in organised crime, extortion and violence against political opponents and other ethnic groups in Kosovo. When elections were held in Kosovo in October 2000, the LDK won a landslide victory with 58% of the vote. Its nearest rival, Hashim Thaçi&#x27;s KLA-linked Democratic Party of Kosovo, polled only 27%. On Monday, 4 March 2002, Rugova was appointed president by the Kosovo Assembly, though this only took place at the fourth attempt after lengthy political negotiations. Rugova lived to see the Constitution of Kosovo adopted by a freely elected democratic Parliament.

As the new President of Kosovo – this time formally acknowledged as such by the international community – Rugova continued to campaign for Kosovo&#x27;s full independence. However, he insisted that it had to be achieved by peaceful means and with the agreement of all parties. He also pursued a policy of very close relations with the United States, as well as with the European Union. His incremental approach was criticised by radicals, but he sought to bring along the supporters of the former KLA; in November 2004, he appointed Ramush Haradinaj, the former commander of the KLA, as Prime Minister. The following month, Rugova was again elected president by the Kosovo Assembly. Nonetheless, he still encountered violent opposition. On 15 March 2005, he escaped —unhurt —an attempted assassination when a bomb exploded in a waste container as his car passed by.

Rugova demonstrated a number of unusual traits during his time as president. He was readily identifiable by the silk neckscarf that he wore as a display of oppression in Kosovo and was known for his habit of giving visitors samples from his rock collection. His presents were carefully graded; the size of a crystal could reflect Rugova&#x27;s feelings about the outcome of a meeting, prompting diplomats to compare notes afterwards about the size of the rocks presented to them. He was also a chain-smoker, and it may have been this habit that caused his eventual fatal condition.

== Death ==

On 30 August 2005, Rugova left Kosovo and went to the United States Air Force Landstuhl Military Hospital in Germany for medical treatment after earlier treatment in Pristina and Camp Bondsteel, the main US base in Kosovo and the second-biggest in Europe. After a week at Landstuhl he returned to Kosovo. On 5 September 2005, he announced that he was suffering from lung cancer, but said that he would not be resigning from the post of president. He underwent chemotherapy, conducted by U.S. Army doctors, at his residence in Pristina but the treatment failed to resolve the cancer. He died four months later, on 21 January 2006. He was buried without religious rites on 26 January at a funeral attended by regional leaders and a crowd estimated to number one and a half million people.
There have been rumors that Rugova converted to Catholicism just before he died. These rumors have never been confirmed by his family nor other source, and one of his closest associates, Sabri Hamiti, in an essay published on the first anniversary of his death, refuted them. He said that Rugova referred to himself as a ‘symbolic Muslim’. The Chancellor of the Catholic Church of Kosovo, Don Shan Zefi, in an interview for Kosovo&#x27;s national television, said that there is no evidence of Rugova&#x27;s conversion to Catholicism or baptism. Zefi denied that he had baptized Rugova. Though he had a state funeral service, the head of the Islamic Community of Kosovo, together with many imams conducted Islamic funeral prayers for Rugova. His grave, located at a hilltop in Prishtina, is oriented perpendicular to Mecca, in accordance with Muslim tradition.

<text>Kjotve the Rich (Old Norse: &quot;Kjǫtvi hinn auðgi&quot;, Norwegian: &quot;Kjøtve den Rike&quot;) was a king of Agder, then one of the petty kingdoms of Norway during the late 9th century. Kjotve led the western Norwegian kings against King Harald Fairhair (&quot;Harald Hårfagre&quot;) at the Battle of Hafrsfjord (&quot;Slaget i Hafrsfjorden&quot;). Defeated by Harald, Kjotve fled; many of his allies were killed in the battle. His son Thorir Haklang was a berserker who fell during the Battle of Hafrsfjord.

==Popular culture==
A character loosely inspired by the historical Kjotve, nicknamed &quot;Kjotve the Cruel&quot;, appears in an antagonistic role during the opening hours of the 2020 video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla&quot;. Kjotve the Cruel has one son named Gorm, who features periodically throughout the game, and Kjotve is revealed through the mobile game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Rebellion&quot; to have a second son, Hrolfr.

Kjotve appears in Paradox Interactive&#x27;s video game &quot;Crusader Kings&quot;, and its two sequels, ruling the province of Agder.

<doc id="537746" wikidata="Q163586" url="?curid=537746" title="List of state routes in Connecticut">
<text>The Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) maintains a system of state highways to serve the predominant flow of traffic between towns within Connecticut, and to towns in surrounding states. State highways also include roads that provide access to federal and state facilities (&quot;Special Service Roads&quot;).

The state highway system consists of roads indicated on the official CTDOT map and highway log. As of January 1, 2007, the state highway system contains a total of of roads (not including ramps and interchange connections), corresponding to approximately 20% of all roads in the state. All state highways are state-maintained except for several segments (totaling 4 miles) that are locally maintained. Interstate highways and U.S. highways in the state are not Connecticut state routes, however they are maintained by the state.

All state highways are given a number designation. All state highways are assigned &quot;Route&quot; numbers. &quot;Route&quot; numbers are in the 2–999 range. State highways that are &quot;special service roads&quot; are assigned &quot;SSR&quot; numbers and are unsigned; these numbers are above 399 and are used for internal CTDOT purposes. Signposted state highways that are not U.S. highways or interstates are signed with the square Connecticut state highway shield.

==State Routes==
Routes are signed state highways and are assigned numbers from 1 to 399 (with the exception of I-684 and I-691). All state, U.S. and Interstate highways are part of the same numbering system. In 1926, the U.S. highway system was implemented. U.S. Routes 1, 5, 6, and 7 were used as designations on several primary state highways, replacing New England routes 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The other New England routes that were not re-designated as U.S. routes became ordinary state highways but kept their number designation, which are used even today (with some realignment). In 1958, Connecticut received approval for the route numbers of its three primary Interstate highways: I-84, I-91, and I-95. State highways with the same number designation as the Interstate highways were renumbered to avoid duplication of route numbers.





















































































==Special Service Roads==

Roads classified by the Department of Transportation as special service roads are given an unsigned number designation between 400 and 499. Special service roads are roads that connect a federal or state facility (including state parks and some Interstate Highway interchanges) to a signed state route. These numbers only appear in internal documentation, none of them are signed.

==State Roads==

State Roads are state-maintained roads that are usually long entrance/exit ramps to/from an expressway, or short interconnecting roads between signed routes. Roads classified by the Department of Transportation as state roads are given an unsigned number designation between 500 and 999. The first digit denotes which Maintenance District the road is mainly located in:
*500–599: District 1: Greater Hartford
*600–699: District 2: Quiet Corner, Lower Connecticut River Valley, Southeastern Connecticut
*700–799: District 3: Southwestern Connecticut, Greater New Haven
*800–899: District 4: Naugatuck River Valley, Greater Danbury, Northwestern Connecticut
*900–999: Statewide; very short routes

State road numbers are only for internal record-keeping and documentation, all of these roads are unsigned.

==History==

=== 1913 trunk line system ===

In 1900, the State Highway Department proposed a statewide system of trunk line routes. By 1913, the system consisted of 10 north-south highways and 4 east-west highways, including the lower Boston Post Road. The system covered roughly . The 14 trunk lines were numbered on paper but were never actually signposted. The 14 trunk line routes were:
* Route 1: east-west from Greenwich to Stonington, roughly modern U.S. Route 1
* Route 2: north-south from Stamford to Salisbury, roughly modern Route 106, Route 33, Route 35, U.S. Route 7, Route 341, Route 41
* Route 3: north-south from Norwalk to North Canaan, roughly modern U.S. Route 7, Route 107, Route 53, Route 37, U.S. Route 202, Route 45, U.S. Route 7
* Route 4: north-south from Bridgeport to Colebrook, roughly modern Route 8
* Route 5: north-south from New Haven to Suffield via Cheshire (concurrent with Route 6 north of Hartford), roughly modern Route 10, Route 4, Route 159
* Route 6: north-south from New Haven to Suffield via Meriden (concurrent with Route 5 north of Hartford), roughly modern U.S. Route 5, Route 71, Route 159
* Route 7: north-south from New Haven to Enfield via Middletown, roughly modern Route 17, Route 99, U.S. Route 5
* Route 8: north-south from Old Saybrook to Hartford, roughly modern Route 9, Route 99
* Route 9: north-south from New London to Colebrook, roughly modern Route 85, Route 2, Route 189, Route 20
* Route 10: north-south from New London to Thompson, roughly modern Route 32, Route 169, Route 12, Route 193
* Route 11: north-south from Stonington to Woodstock, roughly modern Route 2, Route 32, U.S. Route 6, Route 198
* Route 12: east-west from Salisbury to Putnam, roughly Twin Lakes Road, modern U.S. Route 44
* Route 13: east-west from Kent to Sterling, roughly modern Route 341, U.S. Route 202, Route 118, Route 4, U.S. Route 6, Route 14
* Route 14: east-west from Sherman to Killingly, roughly Route 37, Route 67, Route 317, Route 64, Route 322, Route 66, U.S. Route 6

===New England road marking system===
The first public route numbering came with the advent of the New England road marking system of 1922. This highway numbering system was used throughout New England and consisted of 25 routes (with route numbers from 1 to 32). A total of 9 of the routes passed through Connecticut (Routes 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 12, 17, and 32). In this system, inter-state routes would be numbered 1–99 and state routes numbered 100 and up. The New England route system was soon eclipsed by the national U.S. highway system.

=== 1922–1931 ===
The State Highway Department classified state roads as either State Highways (SH) or State Aid Roads (SA). These roads were given number designations – 100–299 for primary routes and 300+ for secondary routes. Some state roads were signposted and some were not.

=== 1932 renumbering ===

The state abandoned its old numbering system and renumbered almost all of their state highways in 1932. Most of the present route numbers were formed during this renumbering. The only route numbers that survived were U.S. Routes and a few state highway routes. For route numbers established in 1932, the new numbering system used odd numbers for north-south routes and even numbers for east-west routes, matching the U.S. Highway numbering system. The New England routes that were grandfathered into the highway system (Routes 8, 10, 12, 32) did not follow the new system. The state also assigned new route numbers in clusters, with routes in the same general location having numbers close to each other as well. Shortly after the renumbering, in 1935, two new U.S. Routes were commissioned: US 44 (taking over part of old New England Route 17) and US 202.

=== 1963 renumbering ===
In 1963, the state passed the Road Reclassification Act to fix the by now fragmented state highway system. Many state highways had state maintenance gaps and several highway segments were even isolated from the rest of the system. State highways were classified into primary, secondary, and service roads. Primary routes were essentially left unchanged, while minor realignments, additions/deletions, and extensions occurred in many secondary routes. About 1/3 of all routes were changed to some degree by this renumbering. The current system of unsigned (&quot;secret&quot;) routes, including the special service roads, was also created during this renumbering. The state highway system has not had any major changes since then. The state completely abandoned the odd/even numbering scheme established in 1932 with new numbers in 1963 assigned without regard to their direction or general location.

<doc id="537756" wikidata="Q1465231" url="?curid=537756" title="Halbach array">
<text>A Halbach array () is a special arrangement of permanent magnets that augments the magnetic field on one side of the array while cancelling the field to near zero on the other side. This is achieved by having a spatially rotating pattern of magnetisation.

The rotating pattern of permanent magnets (on the front face; on the left, up, right, down) can be continued indefinitely and have the same effect. The effect of this arrangement is roughly similar to many horseshoe magnets placed adjacent to each other, with similar poles touching.

This magnetic orientation process replicates that applied by a magnetic recording tape head to the magnetic tape coating during the recording process. The principle was further described by James (Jim) M. Winey of Magnepan in 1970, for the ideal case of continuously rotating magnetization, induced by a one-sided stripe-shaped coil.

The effect was also discovered by John C. Mallinson in 1973, and these &quot;one-sided flux&quot; structures were initially described by him as a &quot;curiosity&quot;, although at the time he recognized from this discovery the potential for significant improvements in magnetic tape technology.

Physicist Klaus Halbach, while at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory during the 1980s, independently invented the Halbach array to focus particle accelerator beams.

==Linear arrays==
===Magnetization===
The magnetic flux distribution of a linear Halbach array may seem somewhat counter-intuitive to those familiar with simple magnets or solenoids. The reason for this flux distribution can be visualised using Mallinson&#x27;s original diagram (note that it uses the negative &quot;y&quot; component, unlike the diagram in Mallinson&#x27;s article). The diagram shows the field from a strip of ferromagnetic material with alternating magnetization in the &quot;y&quot; direction (top left) and in the &quot;x&quot; direction (top right). Note that the field above the plane is in the &quot;same&quot; direction for both structures, but the field below the plane is in &quot;opposite&quot; directions. The effect of superimposing both of these structures is shown in the figure.

The crucial point is that the flux will &quot;cancel below the plane and reinforce itself above the plane&quot;. In fact, any magnetization pattern where the components of magnetization are formula_1 out of phase with each other will result in a one-sided flux. The mathematical transform that shifts the phase of all components of some function by formula_1 is called a Hilbert transform; the components of the magnetization vector can therefore be any Hilbert-transform pair (the simplest of which is simply formula_3, as shown in the diagram above).
The field on the non-cancelling side of the ideal, continuously varying, infinite array is of the form

: formula_4
where
: formula_5 is the field in the form formula_6,
: formula_7 is the magnitude of the field at the surface of the array,
: formula_8 is the wavenumber (i.e., the spatial frequency) formula_9

===Applications===
The advantages of one-sided flux distributions are twofold:
* The field is twice as large on the side on which the flux is confined (in the idealized case).
* There is no stray field produced (in the ideal case) on the opposite side. This helps with field confinement, usually a problem in the design of magnetic structures.

Thus they have a surprising number of applications, ranging from flat refrigerator magnets through industrial applications such as the brushless DC motor, voice coils, magnetic drug targeting to high-tech applications such as wiggler magnets used in particle accelerators and free-electron lasers.

The Inductrack Maglev train and Inductrack rocket-launch system utilize the Halbach array to lift the train by repelling loops of wire in the track.

Flat flexible (not hard ceramic ferrite) refrigerator magnets are created with a Halbach magnetization pattern for a stronger holding force when attached to a flat ferromagnetic surface (e.g. a fridge door) than the holding force from a uniform magnetization. They&#x27;re made from powdered ferrite mixed in a flexible binder (e.g. plastic or rubber) that is exposed to a Halbach magnetization field pattern as it is extruded, permanently giving the ferrite particles in the magnetic compound this one-sided flux distribution (which can be viewed with magnetic viewing film).
Scaling up this design and adding a top sheet gives a wiggler magnet, used in synchrotrons and free-electron lasers. Wiggler magnets wiggle, or oscillate, an electron beam perpendicular to the magnetic field. As the electrons are undergoing acceleration, they radiate electromagnetic energy in their flight direction, and as they interact with the light already emitted, photons along its line are emitted in phase, resulting in a &quot;laser-like&quot; monochromatic and coherent beam.

The design shown above is usually known as a Halbach wiggler. The magnetization vectors in the magnetized sheets rotate in the opposite senses to each other; above, the top sheet&#x27;s magnetization vector rotates clockwise, and the bottom sheet&#x27;s magnetization vector rotates counter-clockwise. This design is chosen so that the &quot;x&quot; components of the magnetic fields from the sheets cancel, and the &quot;y&quot; components reinforce, so that the field is given by

: formula_10

where &quot;k&quot; is the wavenumber of the magnetic sheet given by the spacing between magnetic blocks with the same magnetization vector.

===Variable linear arrays===

A series of magnetic rods, magnetized perpendicular to their axes, can be arranged into a Halbach array. If each rod is then rotated alternately through 90°, the resultant field moves from one side of plane of the rods to the other, as shown schematically in the figure.

This arrangement allows the field to effectively be turned on and off above or below the plane of the rods, depending on the rotation of the rods. Such a device makes an efficient mechanical magnetic latch requiring no power. A detailed study of this arrangement has shown that each rod is subject to a strong torque from its neighboring rods, and therefore requires mechanical stabilization. However, a simple and efficient solution, providing both stabilization and the ability to rotate each rod alternately, is simply to provide an equal-gearing arrangement on each rod, as shown in the figure.
==Cylinder==
A Halbach cylinder is a magnetized cylinder composed of ferromagnetic material producing (in the idealized case) an intense magnetic field confined entirely within the cylinder, with zero field outside. The cylinders can also be magnetized such that the magnetic field is entirely outside the cylinder, with zero field inside. Several magnetization distributions are shown in the figures.

The direction of magnetization within the ferromagnetic material, in plane perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder, is given by

: formula_11

where &quot;Mr&quot; is the ferromagnetic remanence (A/m). A positive value of &quot;k&quot; − 1 gives an internal magnetic field, and a negative one gives an external magnetic field.

Ideally, these structures would be created from an infinite-length cylinder of magnetic material with the direction of magnetization continuously varying. The magnetic flux produced by this ideal design would be perfectly uniform and be entirely confined to either the bore of the cylinder or the outside of the cylinder. Of course, the ideal case of infinite length is not realizable, and in practice the finite length of the cylinders produces &quot;end effects&quot;, which introduce non-uniformities in the field. The difficulty of manufacturing a cylinder with a continuously varying magnetization also usually leads to the design being broken into segments.

===Applications===
These cylindrical structures are used in devices such as brushless AC motors, magnetic couplings and high-field cylinders. Both brushless motors and coupling devices use multipole field arrangements:
* Brushless motors or alternators typically use cylindrical designs in which all the flux is confined to the centre of the bore (such as &quot;k&quot; = 4 above, a 6-pole rotor) with the AC coils also contained within the bore. Such self-shielding motor or alternator designs are more efficient and produce higher torque or output than conventional motor or alternator designs.
* Magnetic-coupling devices transmit torque through magnetically transparent barriers (that is, the barrier is non-magnetic or is magnetic but not affected by an applied magnetic field), for instance, between sealed containers or pressurised vessels. The optimal torque couplings consists of a pair of coaxially nested cylinders with opposite +&quot;k&quot; and −&quot;k&quot; flux magnetization patterns, as this configuration is the only system for infinitely long cylinders that produces a torque. In the lowest-energy state, the outer flux of the inner cylinder exactly matches the internal flux of the outer cylinder. Rotating one cylinder relative to the other from this state results in a restoring torque.
*Cylindrical Halbach Arrays are used in Portable MRI Scanners. They offer the potential for a relatively lightweight, low to mid-field system with no cryogenics, a small fringe field, and no electrical power requirements or heat dissipation needs. The reduced stray fields also enhance safety and minimize interference with surrounding electronic devices.

===Uniform fields===

For the special case of &quot;k&quot; = 2, the field inside the bore is uniform and is given by

: formula_12

where the inner and outer cylinder radii are &quot;R&quot;i and &quot;R&quot;o respectively. &quot;H&quot; is in the &quot;y&quot; direction. This is the simplest form of the Halbach cylinder, and it can be seen that if the ratio of outer to inner radii is greater than &quot;e&quot;, the flux inside the bore actually exceeds the remanence of the magnetic material used to create the cylinder. However, care has to be taken not to produce a field that exceeds the coercivity of the permanent magnets used, as this can result in demagnetization of the cylinder and the production of a much lower field than intended.
This cylindrical design is only one class of designs that produce a uniform field inside a cavity within an array of permanent magnets. Other classes of design include wedge designs, proposed by Abele and Jensen, in which wedges of magnetized material are arranged to provide uniform field within cavities inside the design as shown.

The direction of magnetization of the wedges in (A) can be calculated using a set of rules given by Abele and allows for great freedom in the shape of the cavity. Another class of design is the magnetic mangle (B), proposed by Coey and Cugat, in which uniformly magnetized rods are arranged such that their magnetization matches that of a Halbach cylinder, as shown for a 6-rod design. This design greatly increases access to the region of uniform field, at the expense of the volume of uniform field being smaller than in the cylindrical designs (although this area can be made larger by increasing the number of component rods). Rotating the rods relative to each other results in many possibilities, including a dynamically variable field and various dipolar configurations. It can be seen that the designs shown in (A) and (B) are closely related to the &quot;k&quot; = 2 Halbach cylinder. Other very simple designs for a uniform field include separated magnets with soft iron return paths, as shown in figure (C).

In recent years, these Halbach dipoles have been used to conduct low-field NMR experiments. Compared to commercially available (Bruker Minispec) standard plate geometries (C) of permanent magnets, they, as explained above, offer a huge bore diameter, while still having a reasonably homogeneous field.

====Derivation in the ideal case====
The method used to find the field created by the cylinder is mathematically very similar to that used to investigate a uniformly magnetised sphere.

Because of the symmetry of the arrangement along the cylinder&#x27;s axis, the problem can be treated as two-dimensional. Work in plane-polar coordinates formula_13 with associated unit vectors formula_14 and formula_15, and let the cylinder have radial extent formula_16. Then the magnetisation in the cylinder walls, which has magnitude formula_17, rotates smoothly as
:formula_18
while the magnetisation vanishes outside the walls, that is for the bore formula_19 and surroundings formula_20.

By definition, the auxiliary magnetic field strength formula_21 is related to the magnetisation and magnetic flux density formula_22 by formula_23. Using Gauss&#x27; law formula_24, this is equivalently

Since the problem is static there are no free currents and all time derivatives vanish, so Ampère&#x27;s law additionally requires formula_25, where formula_26 is the magnetic scalar potential (up to a sign under some definitions). Substituting this back into the previous Equation governing formula_21 and formula_28, we find that we need to solve

which has the form of Poisson&#x27;s equation.

Consider now the boundary conditions at the cylinder-air interfaces formula_29 and formula_30. Integrating formula_31 over a small loop straddling the boundary and applying Stokes&#x27; theorem requires that the parallel component of formula_21 is continuous. This in turn requires that formula_26 is continuous across the boundary. (More properly this implies that formula_26 must differ by a &quot;constant&quot; across the boundary, but since the physical quantities we are interested in depend on gradients of this potential, we can arbitrarily set the constant to zero for convenience.) To obtain a second set of conditions, integrate Equation across a small volume straddling the boundary and apply the divergence theorem to find
:formula_35
where the notation formula_36 denotes a jump in the quantity formula_37 across the boundary, and in our case the sign is negative at formula_29 and positive at formula_30. The sign difference is due to the relative orientation of the magnetisation and the surface normal to the part of the integration volume inside the cylinder walls being opposite at the inner and outer boundaries.

In plane-polar coordinates, the divergence of a vector field formula_40 is given by

Similarly, the gradient of a scalar field formula_37 is given by

Combining these two relations, the Laplacian formula_42 becomes

Using Equation , the magnetisation divergence in the cylinder walls is
:formula_43
Hence Equation , which is that we want to solve, becomes by using Equation 

Look for a particular solution of this equation in the cylinder walls. With the benefit of hindsight, consider formula_44, because then we have
:formula_45
and also
:formula_46
Hence formula_47, and comparison with Equation shows that formula_48 is the appropriate particular solution.

Now consider the homogeneous equation for Equation , namely formula_49. This has the form of Laplace&#x27;s equation. Through the method of separation of variables, it can be shown that the general homogeneous solution whose gradient is periodic in formula_50 (such that all the physical quantities are single-valued) is given by
:formula_51
where the formula_52 are arbitrary constants. The desired solution will be the sum of the particular and homogeneous solutions that satisfies the boundary conditions. Again with the benefit of hindsight, let us set most of the constants to zero immediately and assert that the solution is
:formula_53
where now formula_54 are constants to be determined. If we can choose the constants such that the boundary conditions are satisfied, then by the uniqueness theorem for Poisson&#x27;s equation, we must have found the solution.

The continuity conditions give

at the inner boundary and

at the outer boundary. The potential gradient has non-vanishing radial component formula_55 in the cylinder walls and formula_56 in the bore, and so the conditions on the potential derivative become
:formula_57
at the inner boundary and
:formula_58
at the outer boundary. Note that these are identical to Equations and , so indeed the guess was consistent. Hence we have formula_59 and formula_60, giving the solution
:formula_61
Consequently, the magnetic field is given by
:formula_62
while the magnetic flux density can then be found everywhere using the previous definition formula_23. In the bore, where the magnetisation vanishes, this reduces to formula_64. Hence the magnitude of the flux density there is
:formula_65
which is independent of position. Similarly, outside the cylinder the magnetisation also vanishes, and since the magnetic field vanishes there, the flux density does too. So indeed the field is uniform inside and zero outside the ideal Halbach cylinder, with a magnitude depending on its physical dimensions.

===Varying the field===
Halbach cylinders give a static field. However, cylinders can be nested, and by rotating one cylinder relative to the other, cancellation of the field and adjustment of the direction can be achieved. As the outside field of a cylinder is quite low, the relative rotation does not require strong forces. In the ideal case of infinitely long cylinders, no force would be required to rotate a cylinder with respect to the other.

==Sphere==

If the two-dimensional magnetic distribution patterns of the Halbach cylinder are extended to three dimensions, the result is the Halbach sphere. These designs have an extremely uniform field within the interior of the design, as they are not affected by the &quot;end effects&quot; prevalent in the finite-length cylinder design. The magnitude of the uniform field for a sphere also increases to 4/3 the amount for the ideal cylindrical design with the same inner and outer radii. However, for a spherical struction, access to the region of uniform field is usually restricted to a narrow hole at the top and bottom of the design.

The equation for the field in a Halbach sphere is

: formula_66

Higher fields are possible by optimising the spherical design to take account of the fact that it is composed of point dipoles (and not line dipoles). This results in the stretching of the sphere to an elliptical shape and having a non-uniform distribution of magnetization over the component parts. Using this method, as well as soft pole pieces within the design, 4.5 T in a working volume of 20 mm3 was achieved, and this was increased further to 5 T in 2002, although over a smaller working volume of 0.05 mm3. As hard materials are temperature-dependent, refrigeration of the entire magnet array can increase the field within the working area further. This group also reported development of a 5.16 T Halbach dipole cylinder in 2003.

<text>HMS &quot;Fearless&quot; (L10) was a Royal Navy amphibious assault ship that served from 1965 until 2002. One of two s, she was based in HMNB &quot;Portsmouth&quot; and saw service around the world over her 37-year life. She was the last steam-powered surface ship in the Royal Navy.

==Role==

The landing platform docks (LPD) supported a Royal Marines amphibious assault force and provided a platform for the Headquarters capability prior to, and during, the assault phase. The Royal Marines served aboard as the 4th Assault Squadron. The Squadron included crew for the four LCUs, four LCVPs and the Beach Party, which was equipped with a Land Rover, a Bedford 4-ton truck, two tractor units—one a track layer, the other equipped with a bucket—and a Centurion BARV. The squadron also had duties aboard, (ensuring equipment and troops got to shore as they were needed), radio operators and administration.

==Service==
&quot;Fearless&quot; was the first purpose-built LPD used by the Royal Navy. Built in Belfast at the Harland and Wolff yard, she was launched in 1963 before undergoing trials and commissioning in 1965.

Following commissioning, her first operational tasking was acting as a command platform for British Counter-Terrorism operations in Aden, operating Royal Air Force aircraft and the Irish Guards prior to the British withdrawal as Flag of a 25 platform task group. Following the Aden experiences, she was the venue for talks between Harold Wilson and Ian Smith in 1968, over the future of Rhodesia. The latter had unilaterally declared independence (UDI) from Britain, owing to Britain&#x27;s insistence on the removal of white minority rule.

Between 1969 and 1970 she was commanded by Captain John Gerard-Pearse. During this time, &quot;Fearless&quot; toured the Far East and was involved in emergency assistance work in Bangladesh after Typhoon Bhola, carrying 59 Royal Engineers Squadron, who would later become 59 Independent Commando Squadron.

In July 1972, &quot;Fearless&quot; ferried several Centurion AVRE demolition vehicles, derived from the Centurion tank, to Northern Ireland to be deployed there as part of Operation Motorman.

&quot;Fearless&quot; featured in the 1977 James Bond film &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; as the ship that picks up Bond&#x27;s escape pod. The filming took place the previous year near the island of Malta.


&quot;Fearless&quot; was part of the British naval force committed to Operation Corporate, the 1982 Falklands War. Fitted with modern satellite communications equipment, it hosted the staff of amphibious force commander Commodore Michael Clapp (Commodore Amphibious Warfare (COMAW)), and Commanding Officer 3 Commando Brigade, Brigadier Julian Thompson and his staff, as well as elements of the landing force. During the conflict, two of the ship&#x27;s landing craft were involved in rescuing crew from after it had been bombed. Royal Marine Coxswain Corporal Alan White received a commendation from the Task Force Commander, Admiral Sir John Fieldhouse, for his part in rescuing 41 crew using Foxtrot 7, one of four LCVP landing craft carried by &quot;Fearless&quot;. Colour-Sergeant Brian Johnston was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Gallantry Medal for rescuing other crew members in Foxtrot 4, a larger LCU landing craft; he and five of F4&#x27;s crew were killed, and two injured, on 8 June 1982 in an attack by enemy aircraft. Foxtrot 7 is now located in the Royal Marines Museum in Portsmouth, with detailed accounts from Corporal White of the missions he took part in, including the landings at San Carlos. F4 was replaced but is now named FJ in memory of C-Sgt Johnston.

She was placed out of commission for three years in 1985 prior to a two-year refit at Devonport, recommissioning in 1991. During this refit, her 1940s-vintage 40mm Bofors cannon and 1960s-vintage Sea Cat anti-aircraft missile launchers were replaced by 20 mm BMARC and Phalanx CIWS guns.

From 1991 until 1995 she supported the sea training phase of initial officer training, undertaken at Britannia Royal Naval College, as part of the Dartmouth Training Squadron.

She was due to undertake an operation in the Gulf, but that was handed to in 2000. Her last major duty was to take part in amphibious exercises shortly before decommissioning.

===Decommissioned===
&quot;Fearless&quot; was decommissioned in 2002 and awaited disposal in Fareham Creek, Hampshire, moored alongside her sister ship . In October 2007, it was reported that &quot;Fearless&quot; was to be scrapped in Belgium,
five years after the vessel was officially mothballed in Portsmouth. On 17 December 2007, &quot;Fearless&quot; was towed to Ghent in Belgium to be broken. This was the first warship successfully exported for recycling by any Western government that fully complied with international agreements and the principles concerning environmentally sound management of waste.

Replacement LPDs and were ordered during the 1990s. They were commissioned in 2003 and 2005 respectively.

<text>HMS &quot;Intrepid&quot; (L11) was one of two amphibious warfare ships of the Royal Navy. A landing platform dock (LPD), she served from 1967 until 1999. Based in HM Naval Base, Devonport, Plymouth, Devon and HM Naval Base Portsmouth, she saw service around the world over her 32-year life.

At one point slated for decommissioning under terms of the 1981 Defence White Paper, she was rapidly returned to service to sail as part of the British operation to retake the Falkland Islands after the Argentine invasion in 1982. She landed troops in amphibious assaults on the Islands and the Argentine surrender was signed on her deck at the conclusion of the Falklands War.

==Role==

The landing platform docks (LPDs) provided support to a Royal Marines amphibious assault force and provided a platform for the Headquarters capability prior to, and during, the assault phase.

==Service==

&quot;Intrepid&quot; was the second of her class of purpose built LPDs used by Royal Navy. She was built in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, at the John Brown &amp; Company yard and was launched in 1964 before undergoing trials and commissioning in 1967. She was the last ship to be built by John Brown &amp; Co for the Royal Navy.

The LPDs were intended to provide both a heavy lift for amphibious operations and to support a one star (Brigade) Headquarters afloat. As originally designed they could carry a load of fifteen main battle tanks (MBTs), five self-propelled guns, eight recovery and engineer vehicles, six 3-ton trucks with trailers and twenty-eight Land Rovers and trailers, in essence an Armoured Battle Group, or any equivalent load. Accommodation was also provided for up to 450 troops. The ships were equipped with an extensive array of communications equipment and an Amphibious Operations Room (AOR) linked to the Main Communications Office (MCO) and adjacent to the ships own Operations Room on 03 deck. The AOR was used by the Brigade Headquarters until it moved ashore. In addition to HQ 3 Commando Brigade, it could also be used by the army Brigade designated for amphibious operations. In the early 1970s this was Headquarters 24 (Airportable) Brigade based at Plymouth.

To support these roles, part of the original ship&#x27;s complement included two army units, 661 Signal Troop and 506 Operating Troop RCT. The Signal Troop lived and worked with the ship&#x27;s Communications Division whereas the Operating Troop, which included RCT stevedores, a Royal Engineers beach section and a REME recovery crew equipped with a Centurion Beach Armoureed Recovery Vehicle (BARV), worked as part of the Royal Marines Beach Unit. However, in the early 1970s the decision by the Royal Navy to re-role the LPDs, in rotation, as the Dartmouth Training Ship significantly reduced their availability for amphibious operations and training. The army subsequently decided to disband both units and this took place on 3 December 1973 at Devonport. Subsequently both roles were taken over by the Royal Marines.

In November 1967, &quot;Intrepid&quot; formed part of a naval task force deployed to cover the British Withdrawal from Aden. On 29 March 1968, &quot;Intrepid&quot; and the frigate were deployed to patrol off the Greater and Lesser Tunbs, small islands in the Persian Gulf, to deter Iran from occupying the islands. &quot;Intrepid&quot; became the first Royal Navy warship equipped with satellite communication equipment in 1969.

&quot;Intrepid&quot; was the command and control ship for major disaster relief operation in East Pakistan in November 1970. The 1970 Bhola cyclone was a devastating tropical cyclone that struck East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh) and India&#x27;s West Bengal on 3 November 1970. It remains the deadliest tropical cyclone ever recorded and one of the deadliest natural disasters. Melting snow from the Himalayas met the storm surge that flooded much of the low-lying islands of the Ganges Delta. &quot;Intrepid&quot; with HMS &quot;Triumph&quot; left Singapore for the Bay of Bengal to assist with the relief efforts. Force controlled twenty helicopters, eight landing craft, 650 troops, and assisted international and civilian rescue teams distributing supplies. At least 500,000 people lost their lives in the storm. Sailors and Soldiers had to help bury the dead. A hard duty for which Navy Rum, a 200-year tradition which had recently ceased, had to be re-instated.

As a result of defence cuts, &quot;Intrepid&quot; went into reserve in 1976, being brought back into active service in 1979 to allow &quot;Fearless&quot; to be refitted.

It was announced in 1981 that the two LPDs were to be deleted, though that decision was reversed just weeks prior to the outbreak of the Falklands War. &quot;Intrepid&quot; was rapidly brought back into commission, with her ship&#x27;s company recalled by Commander Bryn Telfer (the Executive Officer), and Malcolm MacLeod, the crew gladly returned to form part of the task group committed to Operation Corporate, the British effort to recapture the islands. &quot;Intrepid&quot; was commanded by Captain Peter Dingemans.

With elements of 3 Commando Brigade embarked, &quot;Intrepid&quot; took part in the amphibious landings at San Carlos Water. &quot;Intrepid&quot; was under attack in San Carlos Water on 25 May 1982, with a few fatalities, mainly Royal Marines. She came under heavy air attack once again during the operation, and was the main participant in the landings at Bluff Cove on 6 June. Margaret Thatcher and Sandy Woodward commended the efforts of the ships involved in the San Carlos attacks.

The &quot;Intrepid&quot; would be the last ship to arrive, the last piece in the jigsaw, and so all the timings depended on her.
As well as being one of the warships used for imprisoning the Argentine prisoners of war, the surrender ending the Falklands conflict was signed on &quot;Intrepid&quot;″s deck.

&quot;Intrepid&quot; was refitted at Devonport Royal Dockyard between January 1984 and June 1985, with two Sea Cat launchers removed, with twin 30 mm anti-aircraft mounts and two single 20 mm cannon added. From June 1985 until 1990 she supported the sea training phase of initial officer training, undertaken at Britannia Royal Naval College, as part of the Dartmouth Training Squadron. During the same period &quot;Intrepid&quot; also provided Marine Engineering Artificer Apprentices from HMS &quot;Sultan&quot; their sea training opportunity. During a three to four-month period, each entry of Artificers would spend a week working in each department aboard in order to learn more about the other trades in the Royal Navy.

==Decommissioned==
&quot;Intrepid&quot; was placed in reserve status late in 1990, when &quot;Fearless&quot; completed an extensive refit. &quot;Intrepid&quot; was in poor physical condition by this time, which prevented a similar upgrade, and was laid up at HM Naval Base Portsmouth. &quot;Intrepid&quot; was used as a source of spares for &quot;Fearless&quot;. She was decommissioned in 1999 and awaited her disposal, by scrapping, in Fareham Creek, Hampshire.

On 12 February 2007, the MoD announced that &quot;Intrepid&quot; was to be recycled at a British facility. Leavesley International was selected as the preferred bidder, pending licence acquisition.
The contract aimed to ensure that the ship was disposed of responsibly, and in full compliance with international environmental legislation.

Having received the required planning permission and environmental licences for disposal, &quot;Intrepid&quot; left Portsmouth for her final journey to Liverpool on 13 September 2008. Having been previously suggested as potential diving site on the south coast, various veterans of the Falklands War started a petition on the 10 Downing Street website to preserve the ship as a memorial to the conflict.

Replacement LPDs were ordered during the 1990s with being commissioned in 2003.

<text>Route 34 is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of Connecticut. Route 34 is long, and extends from Newtown near I-84 to Route 10 in New Haven. The highways connects the New Haven and Danbury areas via the Lower Naugatuck River Valley. The portion of the route between New Haven and Derby was an early toll road known as the Derby Turnpike. It formerly ran through downtown New Haven on the Oak Street Connector until the early 2020s.

==Route description==
Route 34 begins as two-lane Berkshire Road in the Sandy Hook section of the town of Newtown, as a continuation of Washington Avenue. The road crosses under I-84 after a tenth of a mile, then intersects after another with Wasserman Way (SSR 490), which leads to ramps to/from I-84 at Exit 11. The road then heads east towards the Stevenson section of the town of Monroe, where the road name changes to Roosevelt Drive at the town line. After intersecting Route 111 (leading to Monroe center), Route 34 crosses the Housatonic River via the Stevenson Dam Bridge into the town of Oxford. Route 34 then follows the east banks of the Housatonic River as it traverses the towns of Oxford and Seymour. Route 34 soon enters the city of Derby, where it becomes Main Street after the intersection with the Derby-Shelton Bridge (SR 712), which leads to Route 110 in downtown Shelton. In downtown Derby, Route 34 has a junction with Route 8 at Exit 15 near the Derby-Shelton train station.

Beyond this junction, Route 34 expands into a four-lane arterial road, crossing over the Naugatuck River. It intersects Route 115 (for Ansonia and Seymour center) right after the bridge then turns southward as New Haven Avenue as it continues towards the town of Orange. In Orange, the road becomes Derby Turnpike and has intersections with Route 121 (for Milford) and Route 152 for Orange center. Along the way, it also has a cloverleaf junction with the Wilbur Cross Parkway (Exits 57-58). Route 34 soon enters the northern edge of West Haven, intersecting with Route 122 (for Westville and West Haven center. Soon after, the road becomes a four-lane undivided road and crosses into New Haven where the road name changes to Derby Avenue, where it reaches its eastern terminus at Route 10 (Ella Grasso Boulevard).

==History==
The Derby Turnpike Company was chartered to build a toll road from New Haven to Derby in May 1798. It ran from downtown New Haven, beginning at York Street, and followed Chapel Street to Derby Avenue, which connected to modern Route 34 and continued to downtown Derby. The Derby Turnpike was the longest-lived of the state&#x27;s early toll roads and only stopped collecting tolls in 1895. West of downtown Derby, another turnpike corporation, the Ousatonic Turnpike, was chartered also in 1795 to build a toll road between Derby and New Milford following the east bank of the Housatonic River. Unlike the Derby Turnpike, the Ousatonic proved to be unprofitable. In 1813, the portion between Southbury and New Milford was discontinued as a toll road. In 1834, the northern half of the remaining portion (north of the present Stevenson Dam) was given to another company, the River Turnpike Company, to try to make the road profitable. In 1841, however, the River Turnpike road reverted to the Ousatonic, and the Ousatonic company itself was dissolved the following year in 1842. The portion of the old Ousatonic road north of Stevenson Dam is now mostly submerged as a result of the damming of the Housatonic to form Lake Zoar and Lake Lillinonah.

The state took over the road at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1922, when route numbers were first publicly signed in the New England region, the route from New Haven to the village of Sandy Hook was designated as State Highway 117. The road followed the Derby Turnpike and the remaining portion of the Ousatonic Turnpike to the village of Stevenson, then the rest of modern Route 34 to Sandy Hook. In the 1932 state highway renumbering, old Highway 117 was renumbered to Route 34 with an additional westward extension to the city of Danbury. At the time, Route 34 overlapped with US 6 into the borough of Newtown, then used modern Route 302 to Bethel and modern Route 53 to downtown Danbury. In 1935, US 202 was established and used the original path of Route 34 between Danbury and Newtown. Route 34 was cut back to end at US 6 in Sandy Hook.

The four-lane section in Derby, Orange, and West Haven was opened in 1940. In the 1940s, Route 34 ended at Sherman Avenue (former US 5 and Route 10). The Oak Street Connector appeared in state highway plans in the mid-1950s and the present freeway opened in 1960. When the freeway opened, Route 34 was designated on it. Route 34 was assigned onto city streets (Chapel Street and George Street) to connect with the original eastern end. When North Frontage Road was completed, Route 34 was relocated onto it via an overlap with current Route 10.

===Highway removal===
In December 2008, the City of New Haven received nine proposals for design/engineering services for the planned boulevardization of the Downtown New Haven (limited access) section of Route 34. Plans for redeveloping the highway&#x27;s western section in New Haven (in a neighborhood also demolished for a limited access highway, but where the highway was never built) have undergone significant public discussion as part of the City of New Haven&#x27;s MDP process for re-using the of empty land.

In May 2013, phase one of the New Haven Downtown Crossing project began, intending to reroute Route 34 away from the freeway segment in New Haven onto widened frontage roads. The former highway right of way would be made available to development. Parking is planned beneath the new development to take advantage of the low grade of the former travel lanes. New bridges are also planned to reconnect streets disconnected by the highway, providing bike lanes and sidewalks, as well as pedestrian access to adjacent development. The project will extend from the reconstructed interchange with I-95/I-91 to the highway&#x27;s terminus at exit 3.

In the early-2020s, Route 34 was undesignated from the former eastern terminus at I-95/I-91 to CT 10, removing its designation along the entire Oak Street Connector.

=== Widening in Derby ===
Beginning in 2011, officials from Derby, the Naugatuck Valley Council of Governments (NVCOG), and the state began preparations to widen a section of Route 34 in Derby from one lane in each direction to two, at an estimated cost of $10 million to $12 million. The proposal also entailed the demolition of several properties along the road. In March 2019, officials demolished four formerly commercial buildings along Route 34 to make room for the widening. The project suffered a long delayed start date, and near doubling in projected costs, drawing the ire of some local residents. Construction finally began on the project in early 2022. Per an announcement by NVCOG in January 2022, construction is estimated to last about 700 days. As of April 2023, the project is still underway.

<text>Operation Corona was a Royal Air Force (RAF) initiative to confuse German nightfighter defences during RAF bomber raids on German cities during World War II. 

The RAF used both native speakers and people who could speak German to a standard where they could be taken for a native speaker to impersonate German air defence officers. They initiated communications via radio with German night fighter pilots and countermanded previously given orders, thus reducing the efficiency of German air defence.

Operation Corona was possible because before the war many people, mostly Jews, had fled Nazi Germany and some of them had settled in the United Kingdom. These people were very valuable to RAF Bomber Command, since between them they natively spoke any German accent and hence were capable of countermanding the orders given from the senior German officers in the Air Defence headquarters, and so could redirect the nightfighters to other targets or give them orders to land immediately at an airbase.

The first use of Corona was during a bombing raid on the German industrial centre of Kassel on the night of 22 to 23 October 1943.

In response to Corona the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; replaced male fighter controllers with females. The RAF countered this by using German-speaking personnel from the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force.

<text>The Sleeping Giant is a series of mesas formed by the erosion of thick, diabase sills on Sibley Peninsula which resembles a giant lying on its back when viewed from the west to north-northwest section of Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. As one moves southward along the shoreline toward Sawyer&#x27;s Bay the Sleeping Giant starts to separate into its various sections. Most distinctly in the view from the cliffs at Sawyer&#x27;s Bay the Giant appears to have an Adam&#x27;s Apple. The formation is part of Sleeping Giant Provincial Park. Its dramatic steep cliffs are among the highest in Ontario (250 m). The southernmost point is known as Thunder Cape, depicted by many early Canadian artists such as William Armstrong.

One Ojibway legend identifies the giant as Nanabijou, who was turned to stone when the secret location of a rich silver mine now known as Silver Islet was disclosed to white men.

Sleeping Giant is the namesake and general setting of the 2015 Canadian film &quot;Sleeping Giant&quot;.

== Seven Wonders of Canada ==
It was voted number seven for a list of Seven Wonders of Canada, with a total of 177,305 votes, beating the Bay of Fundy and Niagara Falls by almost 90,000 votes.
Ultimately it was not selected by the panel of judges, Ra McGuire, Roberta Jamieson and Roy MacGregor, who decided their vote by geographic and poetic criteria
