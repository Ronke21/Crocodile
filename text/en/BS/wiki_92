<text>The Lowest of the Low is a Canadian alternative rock group formed in 1991 from Toronto, Ontario, Canada. They were one of the most influential bands on the Canadian alternative music scene in the early 1990s, garnering widespread critical acclaim and radio play. Their most successful album, &quot;Shakespeare My Butt&quot;, was later named one of the ten greatest albums in Canadian music history in three successive reader polls by the music magazine &quot;Chart&quot;, as well as being ranked as the 84th greatest Canadian album of all time in Bob Mersereau&#x27;s book &quot;The Top 100 Canadian Albums&quot;.

==History==
The band was formed by Ron Hawkins, Stephen Stanley and David Alexander, all members of the band Popular Front, as a side project at a time when their other band was going through internal tensions that eventually led to its breakup. While performing as a trio in folk clubs, they met John Arnott, who became the band&#x27;s fourth member. The band&#x27;s punk-inspired jangle pop quickly became a popular draw on the Queen Street West club circuit in Toronto. They submitted the songs &quot;Gamble&quot; and &quot;Motel 30&quot;, produced by Bob Wiseman, to the $100,000 CFNY Discovery to Disc contest in 1991.

In 1991, they released their debut album, &quot;Shakespeare My Butt&quot;, on Page Publications. The album featured songs they had already performed and toured for several years as Popular Front. Hawkins&#x27;s songs were filled with lyrics about Marxism and the Spanish Civil War, but also contained many references to Toronto landmarks like the Don River, Bathurst Street, and his local pub, &quot;The Only&quot; on Danforth Avenue. The album became one of the best-selling independent releases in Canadian history, selling just short of gold status, and was later named one of the ten greatest albums in Canadian music history by the music magazine &quot;Chart&quot;.

However, the band also resisted some of the compromises and demands of the music industry; most notably, they played an early industry A&amp;R show wearing T-shirts that read &quot;Don&#x27;t suck corporate cock&quot; and &quot;Corporate rock still sucks&quot;.

In 1993, the band signed a distribution deal with A&amp;M Records, and released &quot;Hallucigenia&quot; in 1994. They toured to support the album and had begun early preparations for their follow-up album, but creative and business tensions resulted in the band breaking up later the same year. Hawkins released a solo album, &quot;The Secret of My Excess&quot;, in 1996 before forming Ron Hawkins and the Rusty Nails.

==Reunions==
In 2000, The Lowest of the Low reunited for a five-show tour, playing to sold-out venues in Toronto and Buffalo. In January 2002, the live album &quot;Nothing Short of a Bullet&quot; was released. The album also featured a second disc with three new studio songs, including a cover of the Bad Religion song &quot;Kerosene&quot;.

In 2002, bassist John Arnott left the band and was replaced by Dylan Parker. In 2004, the band signed with MapleMusic Recordings. The same year, the band released &quot;Sordid Fiction&quot;, their first new studio album since 1994. Following the tour for that record, the band went on extended hiatus again.

In November 2007 the band announced that they were breaking up for good. They played two final shows, one on December 4, 2007, at the Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto and another on December 8, 2007, at Club Infinity in Williamsville, New York. This concert was released by fans of the band as a DVD, incorporating several camcorder recordings of the show and a soundboard audio patch. The fan released DVD was entitled &quot;Into the Black&quot;, and can be downloaded on Ron Hawkins&#x27; web site.

In December 2010, the band reunited again for a Massey Hall sold-out show plus two nights at Lee&#x27;s Palace in Toronto to celebrate the release of a new remastered edition of &quot;Shakespeare My Butt&quot; on Pheromone Recordings. They also announced plans for a tour in 2011 to mark the 20th anniversary of the album.

On December 6, 2011, the band performed a surprise set at the 30th anniversary party for The Only, the pub that inspired the song &quot;Just About &#x27;The Only&#x27; Blues&quot; on their first album.

The Lowest of the Low made plans to record their fourth album in the fall of 2013, although the departure of founding member Stephen Stanley halted these plans.

In November 2015, they released two new songs, &quot;The Kids Are All Wrong&quot; and &quot;In the Blink of an Eye&quot;, with new guitarist Brian Macmillan replacing Stanley. In 2017, they released &quot;Do the Right Now&quot;, their first album of new material since 2004&#x27;s &quot;Sordid Fiction&quot;.

In 2018, the band released a career-spanning vinyl LP box set called &quot;Shakespeare...My Box&quot;. It re-released their 4 studio albums, as well as including a new collection of B-sides, live tracks, and remixes, called &quot;Thrifty, Thrifty, Thrifty&quot;.

Their next studio album, &quot;Agitpop&quot;, was released in 2019. In 2021 they followed up with &quot;Taverns and Palaces&quot;, a live album collecting recorded performances from Lee&#x27;s Palace and the Horseshoe Tavern.

In 2023 they released &quot;Welcome to the Plunderdome&quot;, which was their first album in their entire career to be collectively self-produced by the band.

==Influence==

The Lowest of the Low have been cited as a major influence by The Weakerthans, whose leader John K. Samson was previously a member of Propagandhi when the latter covered TLotL&#x27;s song &quot;Gamble&quot;. The Lowest of the Low have actually repaid the favour to The Weakerthans by singing about attending one of their concerts in the song &quot;A Casual Overdose&quot;. Covers of Lowest of the Low songs by other artists include &quot;Rosy and Grey&quot; by Weddings Parties Anything and &quot;Bleed a Little While Tonight&quot; by Jeremy Fisher.

<doc id="559311" wikidata="Q270747" url="?curid=559311" title="Marilu Henner">
<text>Marilu Henner (born April 6, 1952) is an American actress and author. She began her career appearing in the original production of the musical &quot;Grease&quot; in 1971, before making her screen debut in the 1977 comedy-drama film &quot;Between the Lines&quot;. In 1978, Henner was cast in her breakthrough role as Elaine O&#x27;Connor Nardo in the ABC/NBC sitcom &quot;Taxi&quot;, a role she played until 1983 and for which she received five Golden Globe Award nominations.

Henner later had co-starring roles in films such as &quot;Hammett&quot; (1982), &quot;The Man Who Loved Women&quot; (1983), &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot; (1984), &quot;Johnny Dangerously&quot; (1984), &quot;Rustlers&#x27; Rhapsody&quot; (1985), &quot;Ladykillers&quot; (1988), &quot;L.A. Story&quot; (1991), and &quot;Noises Off&quot; (1992). She returned to television with a starring role in the CBS sitcom &quot;Evening Shade&quot; (1990–1994), and had leading roles in many television films.

Henner is one of fewer than 100 known cases of hyperthymesia.

==Early life==
Marilu Henner was born on April 6, 1952 in Chicago, Illinois, as the daughter of Loretta Callis (born Nikoleta Kalogeropoulos), who died of complications of arthritis at age 58 and Joseph Henner (whose surname was originally Pudlowski), who died of a heart attack at age 52. She is of Greek and Polish descent.

==Career==
While a student at the University of Chicago in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago, Henner originated the role of Marty Maraschino in the Kingston Mines production of &quot;Grease&quot; in 1971. When the show was discovered and moved to Broadway, she was asked to reprise the role; however, she chose instead to play Marty in the national touring company alongside John Travolta, who played Doody. Additional Broadway credits for Henner include &quot;Over Here!&quot; with Travolta, revivals of &quot;Pal Joey&quot;, &quot;Chicago&quot;, &quot;Social Security&quot;, and &quot;The Tale of the Allergist&#x27;s Wife&quot;. Her first film appearance was in 1977 sleeper-hit &quot;Between the Lines&quot;, co-starring then-unknowns Jeff Goldblum, Lindsay Crouse, John Heard, and Jill Eikenberry. Her second role was opposite Richard Gere in the 1978 film &quot;Bloodbrothers&quot;.

Henner came to prominence with the role of Elaine Nardo in the situation comedy &quot;Taxi&quot;, portraying a single mother working as a cabbie who aspired to be an artist. She was the leading lady in the 1982 film &quot;Hammett&quot; directed by Wim Wenders, produced by Francis Ford Coppola and starring her first husband Frederic Forrest. In 1983, Henner starred opposite Burt Reynolds in &quot;The Man Who Loved Women&quot;, directed by Blake Edwards. Reynolds then asked Henner to join the cast of &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot; later that year along with Shirley MacLaine and Dom DeLuise. She was the leading lady in the 1984 film &quot;Johnny Dangerously&quot;, playing the love interest to Michael Keaton. In 1985, she once again appeared alongside John Travolta in &quot;Perfect&quot;. In 1991, she appeared opposite Steve Martin in &quot;L.A. Story&quot; as Trudi, a role for which she received a nomination for an American Comedy Award as the Funniest Supporting Female in a Motion Picture. From 1990 through 1994, she appeared opposite Burt Reynolds in the situation comedy &quot;Evening Shade&quot;, which also starred Ossie Davis and Hal Holbrook. She also appeared in &quot;Noises Off&quot; (1992) and in &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; (1999), a film about her &quot;Taxi&quot; co-star Andy Kaufman. Henner played herself (as well as herself playing her &quot;Taxi&quot; character).

Henner guested on &quot;Match Game&quot; and &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;. She provided the voice for Gotham City socialite Veronica Vreeland in &quot;&quot; (1992–1999), reprising the role in the animated films &quot;&quot; (1993) and &quot;Batman &amp; Mr. Freeze: SubZero&quot; (1998). In 1994, she hosted her own daytime talk show, &quot;Marilu&quot;, for 165 episodes.

Henner starred as the domineering mother of the bride in the Brooks &amp; Dunn video &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take the Honky Tonk Out of the Girl&quot; in 2003.

In 2006 and 2007, Henner was the host of the television series &quot;America&#x27;s Ballroom Challenge&quot;. Henner said on an episode of &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;, in early 2008, that she had never actually danced ballroom and would like to go on a season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. This would later come true in 2016 for season 23 of that show. She later hosted FitTV and The Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;Shape Up Your Life&quot;, which is based on her books.

Henner was a contestant on NBC&#x27;s first &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot;, in 2008. She was fired by Donald Trump in the eighth episode but was brought back to help fellow contestant Trace Adkins in the final task of the show.

Henner, who has hyperthymesia, was a consultant for the CBS drama &quot;Unforgettable&quot;, which starred Poppy Montgomery as Carrie Wells, a woman with the same ability. Henner guest-starred as Carrie&#x27;s aunt Evie.
In August 2012, Henner won $25,000 for the charity Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) as a celebrity contestant on &quot;Live! with Kelly&quot; &quot;Grilling with the Stars&quot; contest for her Healthy/Easy Grilled Mushroom and Heirloom Tomato dish. Henner has written nine books on diet, health and memory, the most prominent being &quot;Total Health Makeover&quot;, in which she explains the virtues of a non-dairy diet in conjunction with food combining and exercise. She leads monthly classes on her website, www.marilu.com, designed to help people integrate these steps into a healthier, more active lifestyle. Both of her parents died in their 50s, which prompted her to lead a healthier lifestyle. She hosted &quot;The Art of Living&quot;, produced by United States Media Television. 

Henner rejoined &quot;The Apprentice&quot; for its 13th season on &quot;The All-Star Celebrity Apprentice&quot; where she was joined by fellow &quot;Apprentice&quot; alumni. She played for her charity The Alzheimer&#x27;s Association and won over $50,000 for the cause. She returned, after being eliminated, for the final task to assist Trace Adkins. In 2013, Henner made a guest appearance on &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot; for 5 episodes.

On August 30, 2016, she was revealed as one of the celebrities who would compete on season 23 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. She was partnered with professional dancer Derek Hough. Henner and Hough were eliminated on the ninth week of competition and finished in sixth place.

On July 10, 2018, she appeared as a &quot;guestpert&quot; on the podcast &quot;My Brother, My Brother and Me&quot;. In 2018, Henner appeared on the first season of &quot;The Neighborhood&quot;, a CBS series starring Cedric the Entertainer, Tichina Arnold and Beth Behrs. Henner appeared in episode 8 of the first season titled, “Welcome to Thanksgiving”.

==Personal life==
She has two sons, Nicholas Lieberman and Joseph Lieberman, from her second marriage to Robert Lieberman.

On December 19, 2010, Henner was featured on the U.S. television program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; for her superior autobiographical memory ability. Henner claimed she could remember almost every day of her life since she was 11 years old.

<text>The Freedom Fighters is a superhero team appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The original six characters were the Black Condor, Doll Man, the Human Bomb, the Ray, the Phantom Lady, and Uncle Sam. Although the characters were created by Quality Comics, they never were gathered in a group before being acquired by DC. The team first appeared in a Justice League of America/Justice Society of America team-up, which ran in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #107–108 (October–December 1973), written by Len Wein and drawn by Dick Dillin. Their own ongoing series premiered with &quot;Freedom Fighters&quot; #1 (April 1976), written by Gerry Conway and Martin Pasko, and drawn by Ric Estrada.

==Fictional team history==
Although when the Freedom Fighters appeared for the first time in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #107–108, they were considered natives from Earth-X, retroactive stories established the group as native from Earth-Two, who migrated to Earth-X.

The earliest version of the Freedom Fighters was assembled on December 7, 1941. Uncle Sam brought them together, assembling Neon the Unknown, Magno, the Red Torpedo, the Invisible Hood, Miss America and the Hourman to prevent a tragedy. However, this group failed in its attempt to stop the devastation at Pearl Harbor. All of them but Uncle Sam and Hourman were originally thought killed, but only Magno actually died. This version of the group was a retcon and their battle and alleged deaths were depicted in the pages of Roy Thomas&#x27; two books chronicling that era: &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; and the &quot;Young All-Stars&quot;.

The DC versions of the characters were said to reside on the parallel world of &quot;Earth-X&quot;, where Nazi Germany eventually won a prolonged World War II due to a Japanese invasion of California and the development of nuclear weapons by the Nazis.

The Freedom Fighters had their own book for 15 issues from 1976 to 1978, in which they crossed over to Earth-1 and were quickly set up by the Silver Ghost. They spend the rest of the series on the run from the law, unable to clear themselves. The series was cancelled before the storyline concluded; it was intended to be completed in issues #16-18 of &quot;Secret Society of Super Villains&quot;, but that series, too, was cancelled before the story could be published. This series also introduced the Crusaders and reintroduced Firebrand.

In addition to the core members of the &quot;second team&quot; which were the members seen in the 1970s comic book, other Quality heroes joined later: the Red Bee, Miss America, the Manhunter, Plastic Man, and Quicksilver.

Following the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, the Freedom Fighters were based on the main DC Universe Earth and were all members of the All-Star Squadron.

Years after the war, a third version of the team surfaced in the 1980s, with the rise of a new age of heroes. The Freedom Fighters, along with the Blackhawks and Justice Society, were captured by alien Appellaxians and placed in internment camps. They were freed by the new Justice League of America.

The Freedom Fighters regrouped for a brief time, but soon called it quits again when Firebrand was killed in battle with the Silver Ghost.

A fourth version of the team appeared as an auxiliary of the new Justice Society of America. The Human Bomb, the Black Condor, and the Phantom Lady were later killed by the Secret Society of Super Villains in &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; #1. Damage was critically injured, Iron Munro was absent, and the Ray was captured by the Psycho-Pirate as part of Alexander Luthor&#x27;s plans.

===&quot;Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters&quot;===
A new team of heroes debuted in the limited series &quot;Crisis Aftermath: The Battle for Blüdhaven&quot;, and later featured as Freedom Fighters members in the miniseries &quot;Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters&quot;, which premiered in July 2006. This team consists of new incarnations of the Phantom Lady, the Ray (Stan Silver), the Human Bomb, Doll Man, Bigfoot, the Destroyer and the Face. It is part of S.H.A.D.E., a secret American government agency chartered under the USA PATRIOT Act, led by Father Time. The new team conducts assassinations and other illegal acts against criminal and terrorist organizations. As issue #1 of &quot;Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters&quot; begins, the team is tasked to capture the revived Uncle Sam, who is in the process of forming his own Freedom Fighters team; Sam subsequently recruits the S.H.A.D.E. members to his cause, openly disapproving of their use of deadly force (although they continue to kill people, even under Uncle Sam&#x27;s guidance).

This version of the team is loosely based on notes by Grant Morrison and written by Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray. Uncle Sam is portrayed as an almost Christ-like figure, returning from the dead, with the new Firebrand filling a John the Baptist role. Father Time is shown as aiding in Senator Frank Knight&#x27;s being secretly murdered in the midst of his successful campaign for the Presidency of the U.S. and replaced by a sentient robot double, Gonzo the Mechanical Bastard, who proceeds with an agenda to implant RFID chips in every U.S. citizen by law and control them to bring chaos to the world through war.

In &quot;Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters&quot; #3, a team created by Father Time called First Strike attacked the Freedom Fighters, but not before being stopped by the new Black Condor.

In issue #4, the Black Condor manages to weaken First Strike long enough for the Freedom Fighters to fight back. The Human Bomb kills one of First Strike&#x27;s members, Propaganda, and the team heads back to S.H.A.D.E. headquarters.

In issue #5, the Freedom Fighters defeat First Strike, but are taken out by a young woman claiming to be Miss America. While they are being tortured, S.H.A.D.E. headquarters is attacked by a new Red Bee and an old woman claiming to be the real Miss America.

In issue #6, the Freedom Fighters defeat the new Miss America with the original&#x27;s help, forcing Father Time to retreat. As he begins &quot;molting&quot; into a new body, he gives the order to &quot;activate the traitor&quot;. This turns out to be the Ray, who attacks and kills the new Invisible Hood and calls down giant reinforcements.

In issue #7, The Freedom Fighters face off against the Cosmigods, as Uncle Sam calls them. In the midst of the battle, the traitorous Ray is confronted by the returning Ray Terrill. As predicted, Gonzo turns on the newly rejuvenated Father Time, who proceeds to give Uncle Sam the evidence to prove Gonzo&#x27;s true identity. Sam presents the evidence to the world, and seemingly the final battle between First Strike and the Freedom Fighters begins.

In issue #8, the Freedom Fighters engage in battle against Gonzo&#x27;s metahuman taskforce at the Washington Monument and quickly gain support from the civilians. The public eye are now seeing them as real heroes, which was later revealed to be part of Father Time&#x27;s plan all along. He tricked Gonzo into believing that S.H.A.D.E was against Uncle Sam, while in truth he was preparing the Freedom Fighters to help combat a major threat in the future. Father Time captures Gonzo and turns him into an &#x27;Orphan Box&#x27; in the shape of a pair of spectacles. He plans to use it against Gonzo&#x27;s creator, the Shadow Demons. All of the metahuman taskforce members disappear into the timestream, along with Father Time, shortly thereafter. A week later, the new President appoints the Freedom Fighters the new directors of S.H.A.D.E.

===Further adventures===
In &quot;Countdown&quot; #38, the Freedom Fighters are seen trying to stop an unplanned nuclear missile launch, initiated by the Calculator.

In the new &quot;Freedom Fighters&quot; miniseries written by Justin Gray and Jimmy Palmiotti in 2007, the Red Bee is captured by an alien insect swarm and transformed into a human/insect hybrid. At the same time, S.H.A.D.E. has planned to make the Freedom Fighters into media darlings to help increase faith in the government following the Amazonian incident.

Uncle Sam, Firebrand, Doll Man, and the Human Bomb refuse to go along with the plan and return to the Heartland. For a time, the remaining Freedom Fighters become celebrities, part of a new group called the Crusaders. The Red Bee later collapses in her apartment and a swarm of insects suddenly rise out of her body.

The Phantom Lady, unable to cope with the media attention, goes on a binge spree, culminating in her drunkenly slicing a criminal in half on national television. Stormy is brought to the heartland, where her body is cleaned of toxins by Miss America.

Uncle Sam and Doll Man recruit the original Doll Man (Darrell Dane) from a micro-environment within the Pentagon. After the head of the Crusaders program, Robbins, tries to kill the Red Bee, the Freedom Fighters confront him. It is revealed that Robbins has mental powers that he used to control the Crusaders — and Stormy — leading to her binge.

While the Crusaders and Freedom Fighters battle, the Red Bee is overtaken by her insectoid side, uses her pheromones to enslave the Crusaders and the Freedom Fighters, and prepares to create a &quot;hive&quot; on Earth. Meanwhile, an attempt to cure the Doll Men and several other micro-sized individuals goes horribly wrong, as all of them are merged into a single mutant form. The mutant goes on a rampage until Emma Thompson reaches Lester. The Red Bee is cured of her affliction by Langford &quot;Happy&quot; Terrill, who had gained the powers of Neon the Unknown. The team then prepares to fight off an invasion by the insectoids. After their victory, the group go their separate ways, but Uncle Sam declares that they will be needed when the Crisis begins.

===&quot;Blackest Night&quot;===
In the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; crossover event, Black Lantern power rings are shown heading toward the graves of the Phantom Lady, the Black Condor, and the Human Bomb, presumably to revive them for use in the interstellar revenant army being assembled. At least those three are seen later attacking JSA headquarters, along with the undead revenants of the Society&#x27;s members. These three Black Lanterns, along with Al Pratt&#x27;s undead form, focus on attacking Damage, though they have little success, continually getting blown up, regenerating and rising again to attack him, until Jean Loring&#x27;s revenant kills him.

===Ongoing series===

A new ongoing &quot;Freedom Fighters&quot; series began in September 2010, but was cancelled after only nine issues.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
In September 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted DC&#x27;s continuity. In this new timeline, the Freedom Fighters still inhabit Earth-10, but according to Grant Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Multiversity&quot; revision of the concept, Kal-L landed in German territory in 1938. Hitler reverse-engineered the alien technology that the Kryptonian starship incorporated and released Kal-L/Overman on American forces in the 1950s, which enabled Nazi Germany to win the Second World War. However, Overman became aware of the evil of his comrades after seeing the massive numbers of deaths of innocent people who did not fit into the Nazi ideology. After Hitler died, Overman and his government were able to establish a utopia. The Freedom Fighters still exist as a team of genetically enhanced metahumans, thanks to the genius of the Earth-10 Dr. Sivana, but in revised and inclusive composition (the Ray is gay, Doll Man is a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness, the Black Condor is an African-American, and the Phantom Lady is Romani). The Freedom Fighters commit various acts of terrorism against Overman&#x27;s post-Nazi regime while Overman is in conflict with himself, as he still feels guilt over the ethnic and ideological purges of the Hitler era. In the Freedom Fighters&#x27; most extreme attack, they drop the Earth-10&#x27;s Justice League orbital base on Metropolis, killing millions of people and even further grieving Overman.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
In 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to &quot;The New 52&quot;. &quot;New Super-Man&quot; features a group called the Freedom Fighters of China. Each member of the group is a Chinese version of one of the original Freedom Fighters. They are led by the Flying Dragon General (an analog of Uncle Sam); other members include the Sunbeam (an analog of the Ray), the Blue Condor (an analog of the Black Condor), the Ghost Woman (an analog of the Phantom Lady), Folding Paper Man (an analog of Plastic Man), and the Human Firecracker (an analog of the Human Bomb).

In the pages of &quot;The New Golden Age&quot;, a discussion between Mister Terrific and Quiz Kid has them mentioning that Phantom Lady has taken Human Bomb&#x27;s sidekick Cherry Bomb and Red Bee&#x27;s sidekick Ladybug under her wing so that they can work on getting them associated with the Freedom Fighters which Human Bomb and Red Bee were part of as it is seen on one of the screens.

==Other versions==
* In the final issue of &quot;52&quot;, a new Multiverse is revealed, consisting of 52 realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated &quot;Earth-10&quot;, X being the Roman numeral for 10. This new alternate Earth differs from the original Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Earth-X. In original continuity, the Freedom Fighters were the only metahumans on the original Earth-X, but the new Earth-10 is premised on the continued ascendancy of Nazi Germany, which was defeated in the original JLA/JSA/Freedom Fighters crossover. Earth-10 is home to the JL-Axis, which consists of Nazi counterparts of the Justice League, who combat an alternate version of the Freedom Fighters. Prefigured by comments by Grant Morrison, this alternate universe is not the Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Earth-X, which renders these new characters unrelated to previous versions.
* In the WildStorm miniseries &quot;The Authority: Revolution&quot;, the initial protagonists are a group called the &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot;, a superpatriot group of the 1940s and 1950s. They consist of Paul Revere (super-strength and &quot;broadcast empath&quot;), Minute-Maid (super-strength), Johnny Rocketman (supersonic flight), the Human Hand-Grenade (with the power to shrink, explode, and re-constitute his own body), and Fallout (a man with undefined nuclear powers who wears a shroud). The group is a pastiche of the Freedom Fighters.
* In the DC Comics universe, the &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot; were a paramilitary group that funded Agent Liberty.
* In &quot;Countdown Presents: The Search for Ray Palmer - Superwoman/Batwoman&quot; #1, written by &quot;Freedom Fighters&quot; writers Justin Gray and Jimmy Palmiotti, Earth-11 was revealed to be an Earth home to gender-reversed versions of the heroes of New Earth. Among them were the Freedom Fighters, consisting of female versions of the Ray, the Human Bomb, the Black Condor, and, strangely, Etrigan the Demon, as well as a male version of the Phantom Lady named the Phantom Man. They are led by Columbia, a female version of Uncle Sam.
* In an alternate timeline featured in &quot;The All-New Booster Gold&quot; #8, a group calling themselves the Freedom Fighters exists. It consists of Hawkman, the Green Arrow, Anthro, the Wild Dog, and Pantha.
* In &quot;Time of Crisis&quot;, the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; homage module for &quot;Mutants &amp; Masterminds&quot;, the Übermenschen team is composed of analogues of the original Freedom Fighters.
* All of the original Freedom Fighters besides Uncle Sam and many later or honorary members make cameo appearances in &quot;The Golden Age (comics)&quot;, attending a rally where superheroes are summoned to pledge allegiance to their country. When the villain of the story reveals himself, Black Condor and the Ray are among the first to engage him in battle after one of his accomplices murders Miss America, but they are easily knocked out. Human Bomb lasts longer, but he and Doll Man are both apparently killed in the battle. Red Bee also dies in the battle while it is unclear whether Phantom Lady, Jester, Quicksilver, Alias the Spider, or Red Torpedo participate in the melee.
* The Freedom Fighters inspired the Marvel Comics superhero team the Crusaders. The character associations are: Captain Wings and the Black Condor; Dyna-Mite and Doll Man; Ghost Girl and the Phantom Lady; the Spirit of &#x27;76 and Uncle Sam; Thunder Fist and the Human Bomb; and Tommy Lightning and the Ray. At the same time that the Invaders were meeting the Crusaders in Marvel Comics, the Freedom Fighters were also facing off against a team called the Crusaders, with the DC version of the Crusaders based upon Marvel Comics&#x27; Invaders (several of the Crusaders that fought the Freedom Fighters were really &quot;comic book fans&quot; named &quot;Lennie&quot; (Len Wein), &quot;Marvin&quot; (Marv Wolfman), &quot;Arch&quot; (Archie Goodwin), and &quot;Roy&quot; (Roy Thomas), as shown in Freedom Fighters #9).

==In other media==
===Television=== 
The original Freedom Fighters appear in the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Cry Freedom Fighters!&quot;, consisting of Uncle Sam, Doll Man, the Human Bomb, the Ray, the Phantom Lady, and the Black Condor.

===Arrowverse===
A contemporary variation of the Freedom Fighters appear in media set in the Arrowverse. A majority of this version of the group hail from Earth-X, an alternate reality where the Nazis won World War II and took over the world, and serves as a resistance movement against them in their present.
* The group first appears in the live-action crossover &quot;Crisis on Earth-X&quot;, led by General Winn Schott and consisting of the Ray, Citizen Cold, Guardian, and Red Tornado. They develop an interdimensional gateway and allow the New Reichsmen to take control of it in an attempt to trap them on another Earth. However, heroes from Earth-1 and Earth-38 halt the plan after they were taken prisoner and brought to Earth-X before defeating the New Reichsmen on Earth-1. Afterwards, Ray and Cold establish an alliance with the Earth-1 and 38 heroes to defeat the New Reichsmen&#x27;s remnants. As of the live-action TV series &quot;The Flash&quot; episode &quot;Fury Rogue&quot;, the Freedom Fighters have begun rebuilding Earth-X and continue fighting to suppress the aforementioned remnants. In the comic book tie-in for the crossover &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, the Freedom Fighters and Allies started World War III while fighting the Axis Powers.
* The Freedom Fighters appear in the CW Seed animated web series &quot;Freedom Fighters: The Ray&quot;, consisting of the Black Condor, the Phantom Lady, Doll Man, the Red Tornado, and the Ray.

===Miscellaneous===
The original Freedom Fighters appear in &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; #17, consisting of Uncle Sam, Doll Man, the Human Bomb, the Phantom Lady, the Ray, and the Black Condor. This version of the group works for a contemporary, rogue U.S. government agency.

<doc id="559322" wikidata="Q1188279" url="?curid=559322" title="Pixelization">
<text>Pixelization (in British English pixelisation) or mosaic processing is any technique used in editing images or video, whereby an image is blurred by displaying part or all of it at a markedly lower resolution. It is primarily used for censorship. The effect is a standard graphics filter, available in all but the most basic bitmap graphics editors.

==In media==
Pixelization has also been used for artistic effect, notably in the art print &quot;The Wave of the Future&quot;, a reinterpretation of Katsushika Hokusai&#x27;s &quot;The Great Wave off Kanagawa&quot;. In this updated print, the image of the large ocean wave shifts from the traditional style of the Japanese woodcut print to a pixelized image and finally to a wireframe model computer graphics image. &quot;Westworld&quot; (1973) was the first feature film to use digital image processing to pixelize photography to simulate an android&#x27;s point of view.

The 2010 third-person cover shooter Kane &amp; Lynch 2: Dog Days also used pixelization for artistic purposes, as nudity and headshots are pixelated in the game, to make the game appear more like user-generated content.

==Alternative techniques==

A black rectangular or square box (known as censor bars) may be used to occlude parts of images completely (for example, a black bar covering the eyes instead of the entire face being pixelized). Censor bars were extensively used as a graphic device in the January 2012 protests against SOPA and PIPA.

A drawback of pixelization is that any differences between the large pixels can be exploited in moving images to reconstruct the original, unpixelized image; squinting at a pixelized, moving image can sometimes achieve a similar result. In both cases, integration of the large pixels over time allows smaller, more accurate pixels to be constructed in a still image result. Completely obscuring the censored area with pixels of a constant color or pixels of random colors escapes this drawback but can be more aesthetically jarring.

An additional drawback, when pixelization is used to reduce the repulsing, disturbing or, more generally shocking, aspect of an image, is that all information contained in the pixelized area is lost for the audience. Other visual processing techniques can help reduce the shocking aspect of images or videos while preserving most of the information of the media.

==International legal standards==
Nudity is obscured on broadcast television stations in the United States. The Federal Communications Commission states it is a violation of federal law to air obscene, indecent, and profane programming at any time, especially during certain hours. Monetary penalties and revocation of licenses are issued for law breakers. Japanese pornography laws require that genitals in films (including animated works) and other forms of adult media (such as eroge, drawings, etc) be obscured. Article 175 of Penal Code (Act No.45 of 1907) still in effect today in Japan forbids any person and imprisons anyone who distributes, sells or displays in public an obscene document, drawing or other objects of such nature. In Thailand, restrictions are placed on television broadcast depiction of cigarettes being smoked, alcohol being consumed, or guns being pointed at people. Pixelization is one method of censoring this content.

<doc id="559324" wikidata="Q1456129" url="?curid=559324" title="Letters to Cleo">
<text>Letters to Cleo is an American alternative rock band originating from Boston, Massachusetts, best known for the 1994 single, &quot;Here &amp; Now&quot;, from their full-length debut album, &quot;Aurora Gory Alice&quot; which topped the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart and peaked at 56 on the Billboard Hot 100. The band&#x27;s members are Kay Hanley, Greg McKenna, Michael Eisenstein, Stacy Jones, Scott Riebling, and later, Tom Polce and Joe Klompus.

The group disbanded in 2000 but reunited for a small tour in 2008. In 2016, the band reunited, and on October 14, 2016, released an EP, titled &quot;Back to Nebraska&quot;.

==Band history==

Guitarist Greg McKenna and singer Kay Hanley formed the band Letters to Cleo in 1990. The band was initially called Rebecca Lulu, with Tad Bouve on guitar and Ted Garland on drums with several musicians filling in on bass. In its early phase, the band enlisted various guest players, including a brief period with Abe Laboriel, Jr. as drummer in 1993. The band released a 45 single of &quot;Here &amp; Now&quot; with Rimshak featuring Abe Laboriel on drums with Brian Karp on bass. The band&#x27;s lineup of Hanley, McKenna, Michael Eisenstein on guitar, Stacy Jones on drums, and Scott Riebling on bass, was established in 1994. The band changed its name to Letters to Cleo in 1990. The name &quot;Letters to Cleo&quot; is a reference to Hanley&#x27;s childhood pen pal. They spent their summers together in Canada, and they wrote each other letters to keep in touch over a ten-year period. At some point Cleo moved without giving Hanley her new mailing address, and Hanley&#x27;s letters to Cleo were returned to sender. Hanley rediscovered a box of these letters during the band-naming process, and the band adopted the name. Hanley called it &quot;the least crappy of all the names&quot; they came up with at the time.

Letters to Cleo played gigs in several Boston clubs, including T.T. the Bear&#x27;s Place and The Rathskellar. The band could not seem to find success and was close to breaking up when it recorded their first full-length album, &quot;Aurora Gory Alice&quot;; Hanley had already started another band on the side at the time. The album was released on CherryDisc Records, a Boston-based independent record label, in 1993. The album received extensive airplay around New England. In 1994, the &quot;Billboard&quot; published a review of the album and the next day the band played a much-hyped show at South by Southwest in Austin, which made several recording labels very interested in signing the band. Letters to Cleo decided to sign a record deal with Giant Records, a Warner Brothers subsidiary, in 1994, and it re-released &quot;Aurora Gory Alice&quot; worldwide in 1995.

Soon after signing the deal, their new record label was asked to compile a soundtrack for &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, and the record label decided to put &quot;Here &amp; Now&quot; on it. &quot;Here &amp; Now&quot; was an instant hit, and the song reached number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Singles chart. 

On August 1, 1995, Letters to Cleo released a follow-up album, &quot;Wholesale Meats and Fish&quot;. Its release was followed by extensive tours with Our Lady Peace, Sponge, Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin, and others. The single &quot;Awake&quot; achieved moderate rotation on alternative radio. The band also recorded a cover of The Cars song &quot;Dangerous Type&quot; for the major motion picture &quot;The Craft&quot;.

In 1997, Stacy Jones left the band to join Veruca Salt and was replaced by Tom Polce. That same year, the band released their third album &quot;Go!&quot;. After a short tour, Polce left the band and was replaced by drummer Jason Sutter. In late 1997, Letters to Cleo parted ways with their record label Giant/Revolution.

1998 saw the release of some early demos and B-sides in the form of the &quot;Sister&quot; album released originally by Wicked Disc.

Letters to Cleo appeared in the 1999 film &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; as a favorite band of the character portrayed by Julia Stiles. They contributed four songs to the soundtrack for the film, which included a Cheap Trick cover (&quot;I Want You to Want Me&quot;), and a Nick Lowe &amp; Ian Gomm cover (&quot;Cruel to Be Kind&quot;). Also included were two original tracks, &quot;Come On&quot;, and the beginning of &quot;Co-Pilot&quot; (which can be heard at the end of the scene of their performance at a local club). Whereas the covers appeared on the film&#x27;s soundtrack, &quot;Come On&quot; was released as an MP3 download on the band&#x27;s website. &quot;Co-Pilot&quot; was also not on the film&#x27;s soundtrack, but it appeared on Letters To Cleo&#x27;s album &quot;Go!&quot;. In the closing credits, they were mistakenly credited as Letter to Cleo.

During that same year, the band opened for Cheap Trick at The Paradise Club in Boston. The band then recorded 15 new original songs for the Kids&#x27; WB cartoon, &quot;Generation O!&quot;, which aired from 2000 to 2001.

The band played its final show on May 4, 2000, a benefit for their friend and longtime local supporter, Mikey D. They announced their disbandment the following month. In 2008 they went on a reunion tour and again in 2016.

Kay Hanley provided the singing voice for Rachael Leigh Cook&#x27;s character in the 2001 film &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot;. Letters to Cleo&#x27;s 1999 recording of &quot;I Want You to Want Me&quot; was also used in the film, although it was not included on the soundtrack album.

==Reunion==
In December 2007, an impromptu reunion occurred when four of the original band members appeared at a benefit for longtime supporter Jeanne Connolly, at TT the Bear&#x27;s Place in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The members reunited officially for a series of shows a year later in Los Angeles, Boston and New York City. More dates followed in 2009 with shows in New Orleans, Dallas, Houston, and Austin. Bassist Scott Reibling did not participate in these shows but gave his blessing. Longtime friend of the band Joe Klompus replaced Reibling.

As of July 2009, the band members returned to their own projects.

In the &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; Season 4 episode entitled &quot;The Comeback Kid&quot;, the character Ben Wyatt is seen wearing a Letters to Cleo shirt (show star Amy Poehler attended Boston College during the band&#x27;s early years). This resulted in Letters to Cleo being a trending topic on Twitter. The band reunited to play a fictional concert on the sixth season finale of &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;.

In February 2016, Letters to Cleo was back together and recording new music. The band&#x27;s Facebook and Twitter feeds have been active with status updates, pictures and videos of ongoing recording.

Letters to Cleo appeared as the musical guest at Geek Bowl XII, the twelfth annual event of its kind put on by Geeks Who Drink Pub Quizzes. The event took place in the band&#x27;s hometown of Boston on Saturday, February 17, 2018.

The band released their holiday EP &quot;Ok Christmas&quot; November 2019.

As of 2022, LTC has been playing reunion shows periodically in the Northeast and California. The lineup includes both Stacy Jones and Tom Polce alternating playing drums show to show along with Kay Hanley, Michael Eisenstein, Greg McKenna, and Joe Klompus. 

In 2023, band members Kay Hanley and Tom Polce wrote ten original songs for &quot;Subspace Rhapsody,&quot; the musical-themed ninth episode of the second season of &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot;.

==Solo careers==

Most of the band members also have solo careers. Most notable is Kay Hanley&#x27;s career, which produced the albums &quot;Cherry Marmalade&quot; in 2002, &quot;The Babydoll EP&quot; in 2004, and &quot;Weaponize&quot; in 2008. She provided singing vocals for Rachael Leigh Cook in the 2001 film &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot;. In 2003, Hanley collaborated with musician Jun Senoue for the song &quot;Follow Me&quot; in the video game &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot;. Hanley has also been involved with Disney on several children&#x27;s projects, including the Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;My Friends Tigger &amp; Pooh&quot;, as well as writing all original songs for Disney Junior&#x27;s hit series, &quot;Doc McStuffins&quot;.

Michael Eisenstein has been doing session work and touring work for many artists including Our Lady Peace and Lisa Loeb. He is a producer and engineer.

Hanley and Eisenstein married in the late &#x27;90s and have two children, Zoe Mabel and Henry Aaron (named for legendary baseball Hall Of Famer). They split up in 2010.

Drummer Stacy Jones went on to form American Hi-Fi with fellow Boston musicians Drew Parsons, Jamie Arentzen and Brian Nolan. In addition to being the musical director and drummer for Miley Cyrus, Jones is also the musical director for Life of Dillon. Previous gigs also include playing drums for Matchbox Twenty, Madonna, Dia Frampton, Veruca Salt, Avril Lavigne, Ariana Grande, Joan Jett, Against Me!, The Jonas Brothers, The Flaming Lips, Lily Allen, Billy Ray Cyrus, Sheryl Crow, Cobra Starship, Aimee Mann, The Cab, Hey Monday, Butch Walker, and more.

Scott Riebling went into the production side of music. He has produced work for The Von Bondies, Cobra Starship and Fall Out Boy. Riebling resides in Massachusetts. His brother Eric Riebling plays bass in Pittsburgh band The Affordable Floors. He co-owns a pizza chain (Stoked Pizza) located in the Boston area.

Co-founding member Greg McKenna is playing live with his new band, City Rivals. McKenna resides in Dorchester, Massachusetts.

Tom Polce played with several prominent Boston-based bands and is a producer and engineer. He lives in California.

<text>Ian Raymond Causley (19 October 1940 – 27 April 2020) was an Australian politician. He was a Nationals member of the Australian House of Representatives, representing the Division of Page, New South Wales from 1996 to 2007.

==Early life==
Causley was born on 19 October 1940 in Maclean, New South Wales, the son of Hilda Jean (née Lewis) and Samuel Arthur Causley. His father was a fourth-generation sugarcane farmer.

Causley attended Chatsworth Island Public School and Maclean High School. He won a scholarship to attend the University of New England, but instead chose to work as a sugarcane cutter and save up to purchase his own property. He became president of the Clarence River Cane Growers&#x27; Association as well as a director of the New South Wales Sugar Milling Co-operative and a member of the New South Wales Cane Growers&#x27; Council. He and his wife also owned and managed a hotel in Lismore.

==State politics==
Causley joined the Country Party (later National Party) in 1965. He was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly at the 1984 state election, winning the seat of Clarence for the Nationals from the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) MP Don Day.

In 1990, Causley and deputy premier Wal Murray were investigated by the Independent Commission Against Corruption over allegations they had allowed the sale of Crown land to a National Party donor on non-commercial terms. They were cleared of corruption but found to have &quot;created a climate conducive to corrupt conduct&quot;. Causley successfully sued the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; for damages over the allegations.

==Federal politics==
In the federal parliament, Causley was Deputy Speaker from February 2002 to November 2007, the last five years of the John Howard Prime Ministership, under Speakers Neil Andrew and David Hawker.

<text>Zatanna Zatara (), known mononymously as Zatanna, is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by Gardner Fox and Murphy Anderson, and first appeared in &quot;Hawkman&quot; #4 (November 1964). Throughout the character&#x27;s history, Zatanna is depicted as one of DC Comics&#x27; most well-regarded supernatural superheroes.

The character is depicted as a renown sorceress belonging to the fictional &quot;Homo magi&quot; race, a subset of humans endowed with innate potential to manipulate magic. She is also the daughter of Giovanni Zatara and Sindella, the former a renown stage magician and sorcerer whom she models herself after and the latter whose lineage connects her to the royal line of Atlantis. Zatanna balances her life as a international celebrity stage magician and superhero who often fights against the forces of evil and serves as both a mystic consultant and a notable member of several teams such as the Justice League, Justice League Dark, and the Sentinels of Magic. Within the DC Universe, she is often regarded as one of the most powerful magic users.

Zatanna has appeared in several different media adaptations, including appearing in several television series in the DC Animated Universe, notably voiced by Julie Brown and Jennifer Hale. She has also appeared as a recurring character in the final three seasons of &quot;Smallville&quot;, portrayed by Serinda Swan. A younger version of the character appears in &quot;Young Justice&quot; and &quot;Justice League Action&quot;, voiced by Lacey Chabert, and &quot;DC Super Hero Girls&quot;, voiced by Kari Wahlgren.

==Publication history==
Created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Murphy Anderson, Zatanna first appeared in &quot;Hawkman&quot; #4 (November 1964). When she is introduced, she is on a quest to find her father Zatara who made his first appearance in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1 but had not been published regularly for several years. The storyline crossed multiple comics published by DC at the time, culminating in issues of &quot;Justice League of America&quot;, also written by Fox.

==Fictional character biography==

=== Pre-Crisis on Infinite Earth ===

==== Original origin ====
In her original origin, Zatanna was born to human Giovanni Zatara and &quot;Homo magi&quot; Sindella, inheriting her mother&#x27;s natural affinity for magical powers. Six months after her birth, her mother disappeared and was presumably dead, leading her to be raised by her father. Growing up to be a stage magician with genuine magical powers and modelling herself similarly to her father, Zatara later mysteriously disappears, leading her to travel abroad to perfect her magical craft while searching for her father. Unknown to her, the details of her parents&#x27; disappearance were revealed overtime; her mother would later return to her people, a clan of &quot;Homo magi&quot; known as the &quot;Hidden Ones&quot; and her father was cursed by evil sorceress Allura that would kill both himself and his daughter should he see her again, leading him to reluctantly distance himself from her.

==== Zatara Quest and the JLA ====
In her debut, she is introduced during her quest to find her father, first encountering Hawkman and Hawkgirl. During her quest, she encountered various other superheroes such as Batman and Robin (wherein she was disguised as a witch under the control of villain the Outsider) and teams up with others including the Atom, Green Lantern, and the Elongated Man. Eventually, she learns her father&#x27;s fate and finds him in the mystic dimension of Kharma and encounters the evil Allura, where her good counterpart forced her to lift the curse, reuniting father and daughter after 2 decades.

Not long after, she is eventually elected became a valued member of the Justice League of America although in her tenure, her powers were original diminished, allowing her powers to only control natural forces. Both her mother and background is later revealed to her, where Zatanna learns the cause of her mother&#x27;s disappearance and reason for faking her death: possessing a &quot;medula jewel&quot; within her brain, it acted as a source of power for her clan of the Hidden Ones. Fearing her clan would hunt down her daughter, who also inherited a medulla jewel, she telepathically warns her, with Sindella&#x27;s magic having the odd side-effect of transforming her costume to one resembling her own. With her father and JLA, they meet Sindella, where she explains her disappearances and sacrifices herself to save Zatanna and Zatara from captivity.

=== Post Crisis on Infinite Earths ===

==== Revised background ====
After the Crisis on Infinite Earth crossover event, much of Zatanna&#x27;s history remained the same although several changes came about to her background; her new history reinforced her father&#x27;s disappearance to have taken place when she was eighteen years old. At some point prior to her father&#x27;s death, a young Zatanna also met John Constantine, who she once engaged in tantric sex. Her father later became aware of their relationship, disapproving of Constantine.

The the 1998 &quot;DCU Heroes Secret Files&quot; reveals her birth to be thirty years ago, placing her birth year at around 1958. Other key events for the character is referenced to having taken place, including her becoming a superhero and stage magician nine years prior (1989) and her attempt to rescue her mother alongside her father and the JLA five years prior. It is also eventually revealed she is childhood friends with Bruce Wayne (the future Batman), who came to be trained in escape artistry under her father in his training.

==== Death of Zatara and Timothy Hunter ====
In the &quot;Murder of Crows&quot; storyline, a seance is held by John Constantine, Zatara, Mento, and Sargon the Sorcerer, and Zatanna in an effort to come together and combat the entity known as the Great Evil Beast alongside demonic and divine forces at Wintersgate Manor, the home of Baron Winters in Georgetown, Washington D.C., which is also a temporal threshold to other planes of reality. Due to her past history with Constantine, Giovanni is unusually more protective against Constantine. During the seance, the Beast becomes aware of the seance and after Sargon&#x27;s death, targets Zatanna by attempting to burn her to death. Giovanni sacrifices himself by taking the effects instead, killing him but sparing his daughter&#x27;s life. In Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Books of Magic&quot; limited series, for a time, Zatanna looks after a young boy name Timothy Hunter, destined to become the most powerful wizard in the world, and his girlfriend Molly, cursed by the Queen of Fairies to unable to touch anything in the human world.

==== Come Together, JLA, and the Sentinels of Magic ====
In her 1993 limited series titled &quot;Zatanna: Come Together,&quot; she battles the dark sorcerer Tannarak while her mother&#x27;s spirit, Sindella, encourages her to battle the demon Xaos. Within the series, her lineage is revealed to be connected to the royalty of Atlantis (particularly the Lord of Order, Arion) and the Xaos demon was responsible for its sinking. She also undergoes a change in costume and opt out of using logomancy in favor of amplifying her magical powers with her mother&#x27;s artifacts and traditional spell-casting.

In the 1999 &quot;Days of Judgement&quot; storyline and mini-series, Zatanna is among numerous mystic superheroes who gathered to battle the demon Asmodel, who plotted to usurp the powers of the Spectre. With Earth&#x27;s superheroes unable to properly contend with a significant mystical threat, the Sentinels of Magic is formed with Zatanna as a founding member. The team eventually prevails and is trusted with the Spear of Destiny as a contingency against Hal Jordan&#x27;s Spectre should he ever lose control of himself. The next challenge to the Sentinels appears in the 2001 &quot;Black Baptism&quot; storyline, where mobster demons, the Diablos, targets the Sentinels to drain them of their souls and power. Zatanna is one of the first members to be felled to &quot;Anita Soulfeeda&quot;, a &quot;succubus&quot; seeking to ascend their ranks. Due to efforts from Sebasitan Faust and the Justice League, despite the former&#x27;s negative reputation, Anita is revealed to be a disguised, vengeful Enchantress and is put under the control of Felix Faust, who himself also been possessed by the spirit of Hermes Trismegistus. In the &quot;Obsidian Age&quot;, Zatanna and the Sentinels appears when the Justice League vanishes in the past searching for Aquaman. An emergency protocol created by Batman assembles a contingency League although Jason Blood is the magical expert. When Gamamnae, ancient Atlantean sorceress and would-be conqueror, is identified, she a quagmire spell to absorb Zatanna and Tempest into herself. When Nightwing, the leader in the new league, asks for Blood to use Etrigan against Gamemnae, Blood instead insists Zatanna is the one needed and sacrifices himself in her quagmire spell to free Zatanna. She joins the others in travelling back to ancient Atlantis, where Aquaman has been trapped in a pool of water as a water wraith, Firestorm creating a channel between the pool and the sea before Zatanna casts a spell that allowed the water-based Aquaman to control the entire ocean as his body, allowing him to sink Atlantis in the past and present and disrupt Gamemnae&#x27;s power.

In her 2003 solo one-shot &quot;Zatanna: Everyday Magic, she battles&quot; Nimue Ravensong, a magic-user jealous of Zatanna&#x27;s ability to use magic naturally and without committing sacrifices. Nimue seduced and cursed John Constantine, leading Zatanna into conflict with the sorceress.

==== Identity Crisis and the aftermath ====
During the 2004 &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; storyline, it was revealed that Doctor Light had years earlier raped the now-murdered Sue Dibney, the wife of hero Elongated Man. Opting for a magical lobotomization of Light due to threatening other JLA members&#x27; family. When Batman appears in the middle of the process and tries to stop it, Zatanna Batman&#x27;s memories are also erased. In the present time, Light becomes a suspect as his memories return, prompting the League towards a manhunt but Zatanna&#x27;s role in mind-wiping others is revealed. While Jean Lorning&#x27;s role in Sue&#x27;s murder alongside implicating other villains is revealed, Zatanna&#x27;s role in erasing various villain&#x27;s memories throughout the years causes a moral rift within the League as her reputation deteriorates and her trustworthiness is called into questioned, especially by longtime friends such as Batman. In storylines exploring the aftermath such as &quot;Crisis of Conscience&quot;, Catwoman and the Secret Society of Super-Villains are among those mind-wiped in earlier years, the former done to force her towards a more righteous path.

A 2005 four-issue &quot;Zatanna&quot; limited series was published as part of Grant Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Seven Soldiers&quot; event. In it, at a support group for superheroes, she recounts a failed magical ritual to search for her father&#x27;s tomes, during which one of her past spells summons a shapeshifter named Gwydion, who kills her companions. This trauma, combined with her guilt from her former mind-wipes, robs her of her powers. With the help of her new apprentice, Misty Kilgore, she captures Gwydion to use as her own. She eventually regains her confidence and powers, and uses them to defeat Zor, a rogue Time Tailor who released the Sheeda as a to infect and degrade the entire universe. As a reward, the other Time Tailors allow her one last meeting with her father, who reveals that his books were written for her, his &quot;greatest spell and gift to the world&quot;. In the final battle against the Sheeda, Zatanna casts a spell to move time and space, retroactively positioning the Seven Soldiers to overthrow the Sheeda.

In &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #833 (August 2007), it is stated that Zatanna&#x27;s father was a friend of Thomas Wayne. Zatara trained Bruce Wayne in the art of escape, and Bruce and Zatanna were childhood friends, although Batman believes that he has never met her in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #51, and her only memory of meeting him is while she was disguised. Bruce helps Zatanna investigate the death of one of her former assistants; all clues point to a performer named Ivar Loxias. Loxias is revealed to be the Joker in disguise; he shoots Zatanna in the throat and incapacitates Batman. Zatanna is able to heal herself by writing a curing spell in her own blood, and she is instrumental in foiling the Joker&#x27;s scheme, driving Joker insane in the process. Bruce puts Zatanna&#x27;s betrayal behind him, allowing the two to renew their friendship.

On the &quot;Roll Call&quot; of &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #22 (August 2008), Zatanna is listed as a part of the team. Called upon to help with the Red Tornado&#x27;s restoration in his android form, she aids the League when they are attacked by a new, powerful iteration of Amazo. During the battle, Zatanna has her mouth magically removed with her spells, and once again uses her blood to write out spells and restore it. After that Wonder Woman throws off Amazo&#x27;s concentration and free Zatanna. Zatanna then defeats Amazo once and for all by using the Red Tornado&#x27;s soul. Following this battle, Zatanna rejoins the team.

Zatanna later accompanies Firestorm, Black Lightning, and Batman to Metropolis after they come to believe Kimiyo Hoshi has been kidnapped by agents of the covert metahuman team known as the Shadow Cabinet. After a brief conflict, Zatanna and the others are informed by teenage superheroine Rocket that Kimiyo&#x27;s perceived abduction was actually a misunderstanding caused by the Shadow Cabinet&#x27;s mission to seek out her help in dealing with the cosmic vampire known as Starbreaker. With assistance from Hardware and Icon, Zatanna and her comrades are able to defeat Starbreaker in a battle in the Himalayas.

In the 2009 &quot;Gotham City Sirens&quot; series, Zatanna is visited and restrained by Poison Ivy, who interacts via a tree and asks her if her encounter with Catwoman changed Selina in any way. She later a leave of absence from the JLA, only to reappear during a battle with Despero. Once he is defeated, Zatanna informs the League of the apocalyptic events of the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; taking place across the globe. After taking the team to the Hall of Justice to find Firestorm, she is forced to fight the undead form of her father, continually pitting the black magic he wields against her own. it is implied while she was successful in banishing the Black Lantern, she was left psychologically scarred from having to kill her father again. In the aftermath of, Kimiyo mentions that Zatanna is one of the members who has left the team.

In her self-titled solo series in 2010, no longer an active member of the JLA, Zatanna is asked by officer Dale Colton to help solve a murder case at a restaurant frequented by mobsters. Zatanna informs Dale that the murderer was the sorcerer Brother Night, who rules the supernatural crime scene in San Francisco. After Zatanna shows up at Night&#x27;s demonic nightclub and threatens him, he responds by summoning a demon, but Zatanna defeats and imprisons the demon to aid her later. A crooked casino owner who had made a deal for eternal youth with the demon of avarice by selling the souls of his brides to the demon attempts to use a love potion to win Zatanna&#x27;s soul. When her cousin Zachary Zatara breaks the spell, the casino owner begs Zatanna to turn him into a soulless lump of gold in order to escape torment in Hell. Aside from Brother Night, Zatanna faces other threats, such as Oscar Hample, a man who tried to murder her when she was a child and was turned into a puppet by her father. The &quot;Zatanna&quot; series ended with issue #16 (October 2011).

The Black Canary and Zatanna graphic novel &quot;Bloodspell&quot; written by Paul Dini and drawn by Joe Quinones was to be released in 2012, but was delayed until May 2014. The story centered around a 16-year-old Black Canary&#x27;s first meeting Zatanna.

===&quot;The New 52&quot; onward===

==== Revised background ====
Within the new continuity following Flashpoint and the New 52, details of Zatanna&#x27;s past were altered; her birth years was established to be around 1987, making her younger than her previous depictions. The appearance of her mother also differed and aspects of her past were seemingly changed. Among those changes included a new love interest, Nick Necro, whom she started dating years before she would meet her future teammate, John Constantine. The trio were in a polyamorous relationship until Necro&#x27;s obsession with the Book of Magic droved a wedge between their relationship, causing Constantine and Zatanna to become exclusive to another another for a time.

==== &quot;Justice League Dark&quot; (2011-2015) ====
In the new continuity following the Flashpoint event, Zatanna joins the Justice League Dark, a supernatural off-shoot of the Justice League dedicated to battling the arcane forces led by John Constantine. She teams up with various superheroes such as Etrigan, Swamp Thing, Nightmare Nurse, Madame Xanadu, and others. Based in Constantine&#x27;s House of Mystery, the team first battled a wild Enchantress and then Felix Faust, Nick Necro, and reluctant turncoat Doctor Mist as Necro works to acquire the mythical Books of Magic, a source of obsession since his shared history with Zatanna and John Constantine.

==== &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; ====
Zatanna made her first &quot;Rebirth&quot; appearance in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #958, assisting Bruce Wayne in taking out a robot chasing after a cult member. Later on, Zatanna shows Bruce magic. Later Bruce sees her again and asks her to teach him more about magic. Ultimately she declines and wipes his memory. After the conclusion of the main storyline of the &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; &quot;Batwoman&quot; series, Zatanna is implied to be an outpatient therapist of sorts for Beth Kane, Kate Kane&#x27;s twin sister.

In 2018, a new &quot;Justice League Dark&quot; series began, with a redesigned Zatanna being part of the team. Zatanna travels to Northern Italy to bind a group of demons called &quot;Il Osservatori&quot; in a story called &quot;Zatanna: Sleight of Hand&quot;, published in the &quot;DC New Talent Showcase 2018&quot; #1.

== Character overview ==

=== Characterization ===
In the DC Universe, Zatanna is commonly depicted as having a public identity as both a stage magician and genuine sorceress that battles evil. She has adopted several roles as a superhero, serving as a prominent mystic consultant, valued member of several superhero teams, and a popular leader. The character also owns a side business providing special service in magical and multiverse matters to those whom are in need of it and promises confidentiality.

==== Themes involving reputation and stardom ====
One reoccurring theme for Zatanna&#x27;s character includes her public identity as a traveling, international celebrity status as she balances it with her popular superhero dual life, having adopted the lifestyle due to her father&#x27;s influence. During her first ongoing solo series, her dual life has interfered with her attempts to support Zachary, her cousin and aspiring stage magician whom looks up to his older relative as a source of inspiration and desired her attention and approval. Her trustworthiness as a superhero has also been tested after the events of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, wherein it is revealed Zatanna was responsible for mind-wiping of super-villains&#x27; memories when they learned secret identities of heroes, performed magical lobotomizations to alter the personalities of villains against their will, and also erased the knowledge of these things from certain heroes, the latter two presenting a moral dilemma cumulating to trust issues from team members.

Throughout her publication history, her reputation as a sorceress has varied; her depictions during the 80&#x27;s expressed that while she was a powerful sorceress and a force to reckon with, she was not among most powerful. Overtime, this portrayal has changed to expressing the character to be among the most powerful of sorcerers in the world. In a recent times, both Zatanna and Doctor Fate (Khalid Nassour) are remarked as the &quot;finest mystical warriors on the planet&quot;, with Zatanna also credited with the title of &quot;Sorceress Supreme&quot;.

==== Heritage and ancestry ====
Originally, the character was portrayed as half human and half homo magi, with her human lineage stemming from her father&#x27;s side. Through her paternal line, she is a descendant of Leonardo da Vinci and is related to Nostradamus, Alessandro Cagliostro, Nicholas Flamel, and Evan Fulcanelli, making her of French and Italian descent. However, later retellings of Giovanni&#x27;s background established her as a full homo magi. From her maternal line, she is a descendant of the ancient Atlantean royal demigod, Sorcerer Supreme, and Lord of Order, Arion. Alongside Arion, she is also connected to the Magi clan, the Hidden Ones, and her lineage additionally includes other mages and seers dating back to ancient Atlantis, inheriting various specialties of each.

Within comics, Zatanna has had dated several other superheroes such as Doctor Thirteen, Cyborg, and Batman, whom first began as her childhood friend. In earlier portrayals, both considered pursuing one another but opted out for their own reasons and Catwoman believed her to be a serious contender for his interest alongside Jezebel Jet, his then-fiancé. In later depictions, it was instead said the pair dated at one point in the past prior to Bruce becoming Batman. Additionally, she had a flirtatious relationship with Flash (Barry Allen), having considered even dating him, and Blue Devil. Within alternate universes, she is also romantically involved with Etrigan and Sebastian Faust, son of infamous Felix Faust. After the New 52, she also has dated and Nick Necro, a skilled dark sorcerer prior to him turning evil. Within her solo series, her love interests included civilians such as Josh, an African-American and son of coven witch leader whom Zatanna has known for years prior to them exploring a relationship, and Dale Colton, a San Francisco detective whom is also revealed to he the son of one of her major enemies, Brother Night.

Her most significant love interest is John Constantine, whose affiliation has been characterized as turbulent within in various stories. The pair first met some time shortly into Zatanna&#x27;s adulthood, having once practiced tantric sex. More recent stories emphasized their relationship, having first began from a polyamorous one also involving Nick Necro before the pair broke away from Necro due to his obsession with the Books of Magic deteriorating their shared relationship, resulting in Constantine and Zatanna becoming exclusive to one-another for a time.

==Powers, abilities, and resources==
Her heritage gives her command over mystic and cosmic forces, allowing her to manipulate them in many ways and form. Her chief and most preferred method includes performing magic by saying phrases and/or spells backwards. This variation of magic (&quot;Logomancy&quot;), requires focus in order to used and can be alternatively cast via written form or using sign language in a backwards formation. The character versed in different variations of magic such as black magic, tarot reading for insight or divination, and can draw power from a collection of mystic artifacts collected by her family similarly to other magic practitioners. In a diminished state, her magical powers only allowed her to manipulate natural forces (earth, air, water, wind) and objects.

Zatanna is also a talented stage magician, a trained hand-to-hand combatant, escape artist, and is versed in several different languages including Spanish and ASL.

=== Resources and artifacts ===
Due to her lineage from both sides of the family, Zatanna has access to a diverse collection of arcane objects amassed throughout generations from her families. Much of these are stored in the Shadowcrest Manor, the sentient and ancestral home of the Zatara family which relocates to different locations periodically and is invisible to ordinary observation. The manor can only be accessed by special magic keys or voice recognition and houses the collection of arcane objects, a private library, bestiary, and is inhabited by magical constructs that serve Zatanna, including Hassan the Mummy, who protects the manor. Zatanna also owns a personal apartment in Gotham City, serving as her more publicly accessible residence. Known as the Curious Abode of Zatanna Zatara, it also serves as the central location for her side business.

Some artifacts includes the Talisman of Atlantis and a magical staff owned by her father. When using both artifacts in tandem, it offers easier control and usage over magical manipulation compared to her Logomancy. The &quot;Demongraphy&quot; is a book offering a comprehensive, encyclopedic entries on demonic entities and is updated magically in real-time. The Gnosis Sphere, able to answer any questions posed directly to it, is regarded as the most dangerous object protected by the Zatara family. She also appropriated the Sleepless Queen&#x27;s sword, an enchanted blade capable of transforming those damaged by it into nightmarish forms of themselves (a process known as &quot;Knighted&quot;).

Zatanna also possess a &quot;medula jewel&quot;, an unnatural source of magic developed within the brain of royals in the Hidden Ones clan that can act as a source of magic. It appears within one person per generation, with Sindella being the previous one prior to Zatanna.

=== Weaknesses ===
Zatanna, as a practitioner of Logomancy, utilizes speech as the primary channel for her magical abilities. This reliance on verbal communication has made her vulnerable to being incapacitated by villains who restrain her through binding and gagging. It is observed that her magical powers tend to increase when unused, but excessive use can deplete them, leading to a strain on her physical well-being. Similar to other magic users, Zatanna can only replenish her waning powers through an extended period of rest. Additionally, there appears to be a connection between Zatanna&#x27;s powers and her self-confidence. In the narrative &quot;Seven Soldiers&quot;, a series of significant mistakes left her emotionally and psychologically shattered, rendering her powerless. It was only through the process of restoring her lost confidence that she was able to regain her magical abilities.

<doc id="559329" wikidata="Q2602185" url="?curid=559329" title="Blue Line (Washington Metro)">
<text>The Blue Line is a rapid transit line of the Washington Metro system, consisting of 28 stations in Fairfax County, Alexandria and Arlington, Virginia; Washington, D.C.; and Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States. The Blue Line runs from to . The line shares track with the Orange Line for 13 stations, the Silver Line for 18, and the Yellow Line for six on the same segment and seven altogether. Only three stations (Franconia–Springfield, , and ) are exclusive to the Blue Line.

Trains run every 10 minutes during weekday rush hours, every 12 minutes during weekday off-peak hours and weekends, and every 15 minutes daily after 9:30pm.

== History ==
Planning for Metro began with the Mass Transportation Survey in 1955, which attempted to forecast both freeway and mass transit systems sufficient to meet the needs of 1980. In 1959, the study&#x27;s final report included two rapid transit lines that anticipated downtown Washington subways. Because the plan called for extensive freeway construction in Washington, D.C., alarmed residents lobbied for federal legislation creating a moratorium on freeway construction through July 1, 1962. The National Capital Transportation Agency&#x27;s 1962 &quot;Transportation in the National Capital Region&quot; report anticipated much of the present Blue Line route in Virginia with the route following the railroad right-of-way inside Arlington and Alexandria to Springfield. It did not include a route in Prince George&#x27;s County. The route continued in rapid transit plans until the formation of WMATA.

With the formation of WMATA in October 1966, planning of the system shifted from federal hands to a regional body with representatives of Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia. Congressional route approval was no longer a key consideration. Instead, routes had to serve each local suburban jurisdiction to assure that they would approve bond referendums to finance the system.

The Virginia portion of the Blue Line took much of its present form along the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad right-of-way to Colchester, as construction along existing right-of-way is the least expensive way to build into the suburbs. A surface-level section of the Blue Line that parallels Virginia State Route 110 where passing Arlington National Cemetery and traveling between The Pentagon and Rosslyn replaced a section of the closed Rosslyn Connecting Railroad, a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The railroad&#x27;s predecessor, the Washington Southern Railway, constructed the section in 1896 within the grade of the old disused Alexandria Canal.

In March 1968, the WMATA board approved its Adopted Regional System (ARS), which included the Blue Line from Huntington to Addison Road, with a possible extension to Largo. The ARS contained a Blue Line/Orange Line station at Oklahoma Avenue between Stadium/Armory and the Anacostia River Bridge. Residents objected to a proposed 1,000-car commuter parking lot at that station and the traffic it would generate in the neighborhood. In reaction to their lobbying, the DC government insisted that the station be removed, and the tunnel for the line be extended through the neighborhood. This then made the line the only one to have a station canceled due to neighborhood opposition. To be constructed as an above ground station in the parking lot north of RFK Stadium near Oklahoma Avenue, the station was canceled saving Metro $12 million and the alignment of the line was shifted slightly to the east to address neighbor concerns. To better accommodate tourists, a Smithsonian station exit was added to the Mall, and the federal government requested in 1972 that the Arlington Cemetery station be added to the Blue Line. The federal government paid the cost of both design changes.

Service on the Blue Line began on July 1, 1977, on 18 stations between in Crystal City and in Washington, the first link of the Metro to Virginia. The line was extended by three stations to on November 22, 1980. Service south of National Airport began on June 15, 1991, when opened. The original plan for the line was completed when this link was extended to on June 29, 1997. Two new stations in Maryland – and Largo Town Center (now ) – opened on December 18, 2004.

From its opening on November 20, 1978, until December 11, 1979, the Orange Line was co-aligned with the Blue Line from National Airport to Stadium-Armory, with the Orange Line continuing east from Stadium-Armory to . Beginning December 1, 1979, the Orange Line diverged westward from to when that extension opened. The Blue and Orange Lines remain co-aligned from Rosslyn to Stadium-Armory and the Silver Line is co-signed along the same route as well.

The Blue Line was originally planned to follow a slightly different route. The plan would have sent Blue Line trains to , with Yellow Line trains serving Franconia–Springfield. This was changed due to a shortage of rail cars at the time of the completion of the line to Huntington. Because fewer rail cars were required to operate the Yellow Line service than would be required to run the Blue Line service out to Huntington, the line designations were switched due to the Yellow Line&#x27;s shorter route. From 1999 to 2008, the Blue Line operated to Huntington on July 4, as part of Metro&#x27;s special Independence Day service pattern.

The ARS had the Blue Line end at Addison Road. However, sports fans continually argued for a extension to the Capital Centre sports arena in Largo, Maryland. On February 27, 1997, the WMATA board approved the construction of the extension. By the time the extension opened in 2004, professional basketball and hockey had relocated to a new arena atop the Gallery Place station, and the Capital Centre was replaced with a shopping mall. However, the extension still drew considerable sports spectator traffic because it is within walking distance of the FedExField football stadium. The extension cost $456 million.

In 1998, Congress changed the name of the Washington National Airport station to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, with the law specifying that no money be spent to implement the name change. As a result, WMATA did not change the name of the National Airport station (which never included the full name of the airport). In response to repeated inquiries from Republican congressmen that the station be renamed, WMATA stated that stations are renamed only at the request of the local jurisdiction. Because both Arlington County and the District of Columbia were controlled by Democrats, the name change was blocked. Not until 2001 did Congress make changing the station&#x27;s name a condition of further federal funding.

In May 2018, Metro announced an extensive renovation of platforms at twenty stations across the system. Blue and Yellow Lines south of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport would be closed from May to September 2019, the most extended line closure in Metro&#x27;s history to accommodate these platform reconstructions. All trains terminated at Ronald Reagan Airport as a result.

From March 26, 2020 until June 28, 2020, trains were bypassing , , , , , and stations due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. All stations (except Arlington Cemetery) reopened beginning on June 28, 2020. Arlington Cemetery station was later reopened on August 23, 2020.

Beginning on November 27, 2020, until March 14, 2021, Blue Line trains began serving and stations during most weekends due to Metro modernizing the signal system at Alexandria Rail Yard causing both and Van Dorn Street stations to be closed. Additionally, trains operated to Huntington between December 20, 2020, and January 3, 2021, due to a complete closure at Alexandria Rail Yard. Metro chose to do a total shutdown instead of single tracking because completing the same work with weekend single tracking could more than double the time for completion while providing severely limited rail service with waits of up to 36 minutes between trains. However work was completed three weeks earlier.

On December 14, 2020, WMATA announced that Blue Line service will be suspended between February 13 to May 23, 2021, to rebuild the platforms at both and . Additional Yellow Line trains will operate between and while Silver Line trains will serve in part of the Blue Line.

On June 15, 2022, WMATA announced that an additional Blue Line service called the Blue Plus will operate between and stations beginning on September 10, 2022, due to the 14th Street Bridge shutdown that suspended all Yellow Line service until May 7, 2023. The Yellow Line resumed service on this date, but with its northeastern terminus truncated from to .

On November 16, 1995, WMATA and the developer of the Potomac Yard area of Alexandria, Virginia, signed an agreement to construct a new station between Braddock Road and National Airport that the developer will finance. The Federal Transit Administration, in cooperation with WMATA, the National Park Service and The City of Alexandria government, completed an environmental impact statement for the project in June 2016. The station opened on May 19, 2023.

== Route ==

The southwestern terminal of the Blue Line is the Franconia–Springfield located at the intersection of Frontier Drive and the Franconia-Springfield Parkway (Virginia Route 289). The line travels above ground along the CSX right of way, where it joins the Yellow Line just south of King Street in Old Town Alexandria. The joint line continues north along the CSX Railroad until it curves to the east on an elevated bridge adjacent to the National Airport terminal. The Blue Line (along with the Yellow Line) then enters a subway tunnel under 15th Street South in Crystal City and bends north under Hayes Street and then The Pentagon parking lots. The Blue Line separates from the Yellow Line in this tunnel and emerges on surface tracks that parallel Virginia Route 110 and serve before entering a tunnel south of Rosslyn, where it merges with the Orange Line and Silver Line. The tunnel travels under North Lynn Street and then the Potomac River, where it bends east and travels under I Street NW. There is a non-revenue branch track on the westbound track that connects to the Northwest bound track before Farragut North on the Red Line between the Farragut West and McPherson Square stations. The tunnel bends south under 12th Street NW and crosses underneath the Red Line at the station. The tunnel then turns east under D Street SW, passing under the Green and Yellow Lines at the station. The tunnel continues east under Pennsylvania Avenue SE, G Street SE, and Potomac Avenue SE. The Blue Line along with the Orange and Silver lines) bends north under 19th Street SE and transitions to an elevated line in the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium parking lot near Oklahoma Avenue NE. The Blue Line (along with the Orange and Silver Lines) crosses the Anacostia River on a bridge adjacent to Benning Road NE near RFK Stadium. At this point, the Blue and Silver Lines stay together but both would proceed to part ways with the Orange Line and enters a tunnel under Benning Road and East Capitol Street. The Blue Line (along with the Silver Line) become a surface or elevated route with short tunnels parallel to Central Avenue from to the Eastern terminal at Largo, where it ends adjacent to the parking lots of &quot;The Blvd&quot; shopping center.

In terms of WMATA&#x27;s internal route designations, the Blue Line service travels along the entirety of the J Route (from the terminus at Franconia-Springfield to the C &amp; J junction just south of King Street), part of the C Route (from the C &amp; J junction just south of King Street to Metro Center), part of the D Route (from Metro Center to the D &amp; G Junction just east of Stadium-Armory) and the entire G Route (from the D &amp; G junction past Stadium-Armory to the terminus at Largo Town Center). The Blue Line needs 23 six-car trains (138 rail cars) to run at peak capacity.

==Rush Plus==
On June 18, 2012, Metro initiated its &quot;Rush+&quot; service plan, which had been under consideration for some time. This plan was intended to clear congestion at Rosslyn, where the Blue and Orange lines meet and ultimately prepare the tracks to accommodate the Silver Line. Under the plan, Blue Line trains continued on the usual route but some Yellow Line trains originated at Franconia–Springfield and were routed over the Fenwick Bridge to . During rush hour, there were fewer Blue Line trains on the tracks which could mean potentially increased wait times for regular Blue Line customers. Furthermore, some Orange Line trains were routed to Largo Town Center until the Silver Line opened in July 2014.

== Future ==
A second improvement project involves building a pedestrian tunnel to interconnect the Gallery Place station with Metro Center. A July 2005 study proposed connecting the eastern mezzanine of Metro Center with the western mezzanine of Gallery Place that are only one block apart. The proposed connection would reduce the number of passengers that use the Red Line to transfer between the Yellow Line and the Blue and Orange lines at Metro Center. As of 2011, the project remained unfunded.

In addition, a transportation planning group has proposed an extension of the Blue Line that would reach Potomac Mills in Prince William County.

<text>Rohan Sunil Gavaskar (born 20 February 1976) is a former Indian cricketer.

He played in 11 One Day Internationals. He was a middle-order left-handed batsman and an occasional slow left arm orthodox bowler. 
Rohan is the son of great Indian cricketer Sunil Gavaskar.

==Domestic career==
Gavaskar batted left-handed, and bowled a slow, gentle left-arm spin that picked up crucial wickets at times for Bengal. He spent many years in the shadow of his more illustrious father, Sunil.

In Indian domestic cricket, he represented Bengal in the Ranji Trophy, and East Zone in the Duleep Trophy. Since Mumbai had great batting line-up at that time and he wouldn&#x27;t have got the opportunity to play first-class cricket for Mumbai immediately. He would have to wait for another one or two years, which he didn&#x27;t want to. Bengal gave him that opportunity and he grabbed it.

His first-class average keeps him forever on the fringes of higher honours, and he was a serious contender for a national one-day slot for quite a while before he finally got his chance, against Australia in the 2003–04 VB Series.

He was dropped for the subsequent tour to Pakistan, he was again tried at the start of the 2004–05 season. Appointed captain of Bengal in 2001–02 but the two seasons as leader were poor. He was having regret for not winning the Ranji Trophy for Bengal. They were twice in the finals in consecutive years, but couldn&#x27;t win it.

In 2007, Gavaskar signed a contract with Indian Cricket League, playing for the Kolkata Tigers which was declared unauthorised by BCCI. 
After breaking his links with the league, and returning to mainstream Indian domestic cricket, he was selected to play in the third season of the Indian Premier League for the Kolkata Knight Riders. He played in his last first class match in 2009 and retired in 2012.

He was one among the 71 players granted amnesty by the BCCI in June 2009, marking his return to the official fold.

Gavaskar announced his retirement from first-class cricket on 9 February 2012. Rohan, who played his first-class cricket for Bengal, scored 5073 runs in 75 matches at 51.24.

==International career==

Gavaskar was selected for the Indian cricket team to tour Australia in 2004, and made his ODI debut after Mohammad Kaif was forced out of the team due to injury. He did not make a lasting impression on the international game, and his last ODI came during the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy.

==Media career==

Like his father, Rohan followed commentating career post-retirement. He has been seen on doing commentary in IPL 2013 and shows on Star Sports&#x27; Star Power and NDTV&#x27;s sports show.

==Personal life==
He was given the names Rohan Jaivishwa by his father as a tribute to his 3 favourite cricketers – &quot;Rohan&quot; Kanhai; M. L. &quot;Jai&quot;simha; and Rohan&#x27;s uncle, Gundappa &quot;Vishwa&quot;nath –
although his name is usually recorded as Rohan Sunil Gavaskar. He studied at St. Xaviers Collegiate School, Kolkata, Bombay Scottish School, and then Ramniranjan Anandilal Podar College of Commerce and Economics.

Rohan is married to Swati Mankar.

<doc id="559336" wikidata="Q255648" url="?curid=559336" title="Lockheed Martin X-33">
<text>The Lockheed Martin X-33 was a proposed uncrewed, sub-scale technology demonstrator suborbital spaceplane that was developed for a period in the 1990s. The X-33 was a technology demonstrator for the VentureStar orbital spaceplane, which was planned to be a next-generation, commercially operated reusable launch vehicle. The X-33 would flight-test a range of technologies that NASA believed it needed for single-stage-to-orbit reusable launch vehicles (SSTO RLVs), such as metallic thermal protection systems, composite cryogenic fuel tanks for liquid hydrogen, the aerospike engine, autonomous (uncrewed) flight control, rapid flight turn-around times through streamlined operations, and its lifting body aerodynamics.

Failures of its 21-meter wingspan and multi-lobed, composite-material fuel tank during pressure testing ultimately led to the withdrawal of federal support for the program in early 2001. Lockheed Martin has conducted unrelated testing, and has had a single success after a string of failures as recently as 2009 using a 2-meter scale model.

== History==
In 1994 NASA initiated the Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) program. After a Phase I programme developing proposals from Rockwell International, McDonnell Douglas, and Lockheed Martin, a Phase II contract to develop the X-33 as a demonstrator vehicle was awarded to Lockheed Martin in 1996. At the same time Orbital Sciences was awarded a contract to develop the X-34, an air-launched hypersonic research vehicle.

The goals of the RLV program were:
*To &quot;demonstrate technologies leading to a new generation of space boosters capable of delivering payloads at significantly lower cost&quot;
*To &quot;provide a technology base for development of advanced commercial launch systems that will make U.S. aerospace manufacturers more competitive in the global market.&quot;

$1 billion was spent through 1999 with about 80 percent coming from NASA and additional money contributed by the industry partners. The goal was to have a first flight by March 1999, and to have the VentureStar, the operational reusable space vehicle, flying in 2006.

=== Cancellation ===
The program was cancelled in February 2001.

Construction of the prototype was some 85% assembled with 96% of the parts and the launch facility 100% complete when the program was canceled by NASA in 2001, after a long series of technical difficulties including flight instability and excess weight.

In particular, the composite liquid hydrogen fuel tank failed during testing in November 1999. The tank was constructed of honeycomb composite walls and internal structures to reduce its weight. A lighter tank was needed for the craft to demonstrate necessary technologies for single-stage-to-orbit operations. A hydrogen fueled SSTO craft&#x27;s mass fraction requires that the weight of the vehicle without fuel be 10% of the fully fueled weight. This would allow a vehicle to fly to low Earth orbit without the need for the sort of external boosters and fuel tanks used by the Space Shuttle. But, after the composite tank failed on the test stand during fueling and pressure tests, NASA came to the conclusion that the technology of the time was simply not advanced enough for such a design. While the composite tank walls themselves were lighter, the hydrogen tank shape necessary to fit inside the aerodynamic mouldline resulted in complex joints increasing the total mass of the composite tank to above that of an aluminum-based tank, and too heavy for an SSTO vehicle.
NASA had invested $922 million in the project before cancellation, and Lockheed Martin a further $357 million. Due to changes in the space launch business—including the challenges faced by companies such as Globalstar, Teledesic, and Iridium and the resulting drop in the anticipated number of commercial satellite launches per year, Lockheed Martin concluded that continuing development of the X-33 privately without government support would not be profitable.

In 2004 Northrop Grumman successfully built and tested a simple cylindrical composite cryogenic hydrogen tank as part of early work for the Constellation program.

== Design and development ==


Through the use of the lifting body shape, composite multi-lobed liquid fuel tanks, and the aerospike engine, NASA and Lockheed Martin hoped to test fly a craft that would demonstrate the viability of a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) design. A spacecraft capable of reaching orbit in a single stage would not require external fuel tanks or boosters to reach low Earth orbit. Doing away with the need for &quot;staging&quot; with launch vehicles, such as with the Shuttle and the Apollo rockets, would lead to an inherently more reliable and safer space launch vehicle. While the X-33 would not approach airplane-like safety, the X-33 would attempt to demonstrate 0.997 reliability, or 3 mishaps out of 1,000 launches, which would be an order of magnitude more reliable than the Space Shuttle. The 15 planned experimental X-33 flights could only begin this statistical evaluation.

The uncrewed craft would have been launched vertically from a specially designed facility constructed on Edwards Air Force Base, and landed horizontally (VTHL) on a runway at the end of its mission. Initial sub-orbital test flights were planned from Edwards AFB to Dugway Proving Grounds southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah.

Once those test flights were completed, further flight tests were to be conducted from Edwards AFB to Malmstrom AFB in Great Falls, Montana, to gather more complete data on aircraft heating and engine performance at higher speeds and altitudes.

On July 2, 1996, NASA selected Lockheed Martin Skunk Works of Palmdale, California, to design, build, and test the X-33 experimental vehicle for the RLV program. Lockheed Martin&#x27;s design concept for the X-33 was selected over competing concepts from Rockwell International and McDonnell Douglas. Rockwell proposed a Space Shuttle-derived design, and McDonnell Douglas proposed a design based on its vertical takeoff and landing (VTVL) DC-XA test vehicle.

The uncrewed X-33 was slated to fly 15 suborbital hops to near 75.8 km altitude. It was to be launched upright like a rocket and rather than having a straight flight path it would fly diagonally up for half the flight, reaching extremely high altitudes, and then for the rest of the flight glide back down to a runway.

The X-33 was never intended to fly higher than an altitude of 100 km, nor faster than one-half of orbital velocity. Had any successful tests occurred, extrapolation would have been necessary to apply the results to a proposed orbital vehicle.

The decision to design and build the X-33 grew out of an internal NASA study titled &quot;Access to Space&quot;. Unlike other space transport studies, &quot;Access to Space&quot; was to result in the design and construction of a vehicle.

=== Commercial spaceflight ===
Based on the X-33 experience shared with NASA, Lockheed Martin hoped to make the business case for a full-scale SSTO RLV, called VentureStar, that would be developed and operated through commercial means. The intention was that rather than operate space transport systems as it has with the Space Shuttle, NASA would instead look to private industry to operate the reusable launch vehicle and NASA would purchase launch services from the commercial launch provider. Thus, the X-33 was not only about honing space flight technologies, but also about successfully demonstrating the technology required to make a commercial reusable launch vehicle possible.

The VentureStar was to be the first commercial aircraft to fly into space. The VentureStar was intended for long inter-continental flights and supposed to be in service by 2012, but this project was never funded or begun.


=== Continued research ===
After the cancellation in 2001, engineers were able to make a working liquid-oxygen tank from carbon-fiber composite. Tests showed that composites were feasible materials for liquid-oxygen tanks

On September 7, 2004, Northrop Grumman and NASA engineers unveiled a liquid-hydrogen tank made of carbon-fiber composite material that had demonstrated the ability for repeated fuelings and simulated launch cycles. Northrop Grumman concluded that these successful tests have enabled the development and refinement of new manufacturing processes that will allow the company to build large composite tanks without an autoclave; and design and engineering development of conformal fuel tanks appropriate for use on a single-stage-to-orbit vehicle.

== The alternative proposals ==
Five companies expressed interest and proposed concepts. Of those five Lockheed Martin, Rockwell and McDonnell Douglas were selected for workup into more detailed proposals.

===Rockwell===
Rockwell proposed a Space Shuttle-derived design. It would have used one Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) and two RL-10-5A engines.

In a subsequent full-scale system to reach orbit Rockwell planned to use six Rocketdyne RS-2100 engines.

===McDonnell Douglas===
McDonnell Douglas featured a design using liquid oxygen/hydrogen bell engines based on its vertical takeoff and landing DC-XA test vehicle. It would have used a single SSME for the main propulsion system.

<doc id="559339" wikidata="Q2569969" url="?curid=559339" title="Tie-dye">
<text>Tie-dye is a term used to describe a number of resist dyeing techniques and the resulting dyed products of these processes. The process of tie-dye typically consists of folding, twisting, pleating, or crumpling fabric or a garment, before binding with string or rubber bands, followed by the application of dye or dyes. The manipulations of the fabric before the application of dye are called resists, as they partially or completely prevent (&#x27;resist&#x27;) the applied dye from coloring the fabric. More sophisticated tie-dye may involve additional steps, including an initial application of dye before the resist, multiple sequential dyeing and resist steps, and the use of other types of resists (stitching, stencils) and discharge.

Unlike regular resist-dyeing techniques, modern tie-dye is characterized by the use of bright, saturated primary colors and bold patterns. These patterns, including the spiral, mandala, and peace sign, and the use of multiple bold colors, have become clichéd to become symbols of the counterculture movement of the 1960s and 1970s. However tie-dye wasn&#x27;t as pronounced in fashion even among the counterculture as it would be in later years and the present day. The vast majority of tie-dye garments and objects produced for wholesale distribution use these designs, with many being mass-produced.

In the 21st century, a revived interest in more &#x27;sophisticated&#x27; tie-dye techniques emerged in the fashion and hobby industry, characterized by simple motifs, monochromatic color schemes, a focus on fashionable garments and fabrics other than cotton, and the pursuit of tie-dye as an art form, rather than a commodity.

==Dyes, fabrics, and discharge agents==
A variety of dyes are used in tie-dyeing, including household, fiber reactive, acid, and vat dyes. Most early (1960s) tie-dyes were made with retail household dyes, particularly those made by Rit. These dyes were designed for use on a number of different fibre types, and consisted of several different dyes, making them less effective and less colourfast than purely fiber-reactive dyes.

Most tie-dyes are now dyed with fiber-reactive dyes, a class of dyes effective on cellulose fibers such as cotton, hemp, rayon, and linen. This class of dyes reacts with fibers at alkaline (high) pH, forming a wash-fast, permanent bond. Soda ash (sodium carbonate) is the most common agent used to raise the pH and initiate the reaction, and is either added directly to the dye or in a solution of water in which garments are soaked before dyeing. Fiber-reactives dyes are relatively safe and simple to use, and are the same dyes used commercially to color cellulosic fabrics.

Protein-based fibers such as silk, wool, and feathers, as well as the synthetic polyamide fiber nylon, can be dyed with acid dyes. Acid dyes are effective at acidic (low) pH, where they form ionic bonds with the fiber. Acid dyes are also relatively safe (some are used as food dyes) and simple to use. Vat dyes, including indigo, are a third class of dyes that are effective on cellulose fibers and silk. Vat dyes are insoluble in water in their unreduced form, and must be chemically reduced before they can be used to color fabric. This is accomplished by heating the dye in a strongly basic solution of sodium hydroxide (lye) or sodium carbonate (caustic potash) containing a reducing agent such as sodium hydrosulfite or thiourea dioxide. The fabric is immersed in the dye bath, and after removal, the dye oxidizes to its insoluble form, binding with high wash-fastness to the fiber. However, vat dyes, and especially indigo, must be treated after dyeing by &#x27;soaping&#x27; to prevent the dye from rubbing (crocking) off. Vat dyes can be used to simultaneously dye the fabric and to remove underlying fiber-reactive dye (i.e., can dye a black cotton fabric yellow) because of the bleaching action of the reducing bath. The extra complexity and safety issues (particularly when using strong bases such as lye) restrict the use of vat dyes in tie-dye to experts.

Discharge agents are used to bleach color from the previously dyed fabrics and can be used as a reverse tie-dye, where the application of the agent results in loss of color rather than its application. Household bleach (sodium hypochlorite) can be used to discharge fiber-reactive dyes on bleach-resistant fibers such as cotton or hemp, but not on wool or silk, though the results are variable, as some fiber-reactive dyes are more resistant to bleach than others. It is important to bleach as long as required to obtain the desired shade (which will be lighter than observed on wet, unwashed fabric), and to neutralize the bleach with agents such as sodium bisulfite, to prevent damage to the fibers. Thiourea dioxide is another commonly used discharge agent that can be used on cotton, wool, or silk. A thiourea dioxide discharge bath is made with hot water made mildly basic with sodium carbonate. The results of thiourea dioxide discharge differ significantly from bleach discharge due to the nature of the reaction. Since thiourea dioxide only bleaches in the absence of oxygen, and the fabric to be bleached retains oxygen, a fractal pattern of bleaching will be observed. This is in distinct contrast with household bleach discharge, where the bleaching agent penetrates fabric easily (particularly in bleach formulations containing detergent). For example, pleating fabric multiple times and clamping on a resist will yield a clear design after outlining the resist with household bleach, but discharge with reducing agents will only partially penetrate the resisted area.

In general, discharge techniques, particularly using household bleach, are a readily accessible way to tie-dye without the use of often messy and relatively expensive dyes. It is particularly easy to put a design on cloth using stencils and sprayed-on solutions of household bleach, but the intricate and unintended results of discharge using reducing agents often surpass the results of oxidizing discharge techniques.

==Designs and patterns==

Tie-dye can be used to create a wide variety of designs on fabric, from standard patterns such as the spiral, peace sign, diamond, sunburst, and the marble effect to beautiful works of art. Using techniques such as stencils (as in screen printing using dyes or discharge pastes), clamped-on shaped blocks, and tritik (stitching and gathering), tie-dye can produce almost any design desired. If a modern kit is used, then it is easier to accomplish a spiral or circle.

==History==
===Earliest examples===
The earliest examples of tie-dye in the Far East are from Sui dynasty (5th century AD) China.

The earliest surviving examples of pre-Columbian tie-dye in Peru date from 500 to 810 AD. Their designs include small circles and lines, with bright colors including red, yellow, blue, and green.

===Asia===
 is a form of tie-dye which originated in Japan, and has been practiced there since the 8th century. includes several labor-intensive resist techniques which include stitching elaborate patterns and tightly gathering the stitching before dyeing, forming intricate designs for kimono, and other accessories and garments. Another method is to wrap the fabric around a core of rope, wood, or other material, and bind it tightly with string or thread. The areas of the fabric that are against the core or under the binding would remain undyed.

In Indonesia, especially in Java, tie-dye is known as . 
Other terms including and are Indonesian terms derived from Javanese words for methods related to tie-dye. In Indonesia, tie-dye might be combined with other dyeing technique, such as , which combine tie-dye with batik wax-resist dyeing. Ikat is a method of tie-dyeing the warp or weft before the cloth is woven.

Bandhani is an Indian form of tie-dye that originated in western India.

 tie-dye originates in Thailand and the neighboring part of Laos. It uses different shapes and colors from other types of tie-dye, and the colors are, in general, more subdued. Another difference is that the base color is black.

In the 1941 book, &quot;Orphans of the Pacific&quot;, about the Philippines, it was noted: &quot;There are a few thousand Bagobos, who wear highly decorated clothing made of hemp fiber, all tied-and-dyed into fancy designs, and who further ornament themselves with big metal disks.&quot;

In China, especially in Dali, Yunnan Province, a traditional form of tie-dye is practiced by the Dali Bai people, known as Dali Bai nationality tie-dye ().
===Africa===
Tie-dye techniques have also been used for centuries in the Hausa region of West Africa, with renowned indigo dye pits located in and around Kano, Nigeria. The tie-dyed clothing is then richly embroidered in traditional patterns. It has been suggested that these African techniques were the inspiration for the tie-dyed garments identified with hippie fashion.

In southwestern Nigeria, the technique known as is produced, using a variety of resist-dyeing techniques.

===Tie-dye in the Western world===
Tie-dyeing was known in the US by 1909, when Professor Charles E. Pellow of Columbia University acquired some samples of tie-dyed muslin and subsequently gave a lecture and live demonstration of the technique.

Although and batik techniques were used occasionally in Western fashion before the 1960s, modern psychedelic tie-dyeing did not become a fad until the late 1960s following the example set by rock stars such as Janis Joplin and John Sebastian (who did his own dyeing). The 2011 film documentary &quot;Magic Trip&quot;, which shows amateur film footage taken during the 1964 cross-country bus journey of countercultural icon Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters, shows the travelers developing a form of tie-dye by taking LSD beside a pond and pouring enamel-based model airplane paint into it, before placing a white T-shirt upon the surface of the water. Although the process is closer to paper marbling, in the accompanying narrative, the travelers claim credit for inventing tie-dyeing.

Tie-dyeing, particularly after the introduction of affordable dyes, became popular as a cheap and accessible way to customize inexpensive T-shirts, singlets, dresses, jeans, army surplus clothing, and other garments into psychedelic creations. Some of the leading names in tie-dye at this time were Water Baby Dye Works (run by Ann Thomas and Maureen Mubeem), Bert Bliss, and Up Tied, the latter winning a Coty Award for &quot;major creativity in fabrics&quot; in 1970. Up Tied created tie-dyed velvets and silk chiffons which were used for exclusive one-of-a-kind garments by Halston, Donald Brooks, and Gayle Kirkpatrick, whilst another tie-dyer, Smooth Tooth Inc., dyed garments for Dior and Jonathan Logan. In late 1960s London, Gordon Deighton created tie-dyed shirts and trousers for young fashionable men which he sold through the Simpsons of Piccadilly department store in London.

<doc id="559356" wikidata="Q3656909" url="?curid=559356" title="Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew!">
<text>Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! is a DC Comics series about a team of talking animal superheroes called the Zoo Crew. The characters first appeared in a 16-page special insert in &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; #16 (February 1982), followed by a series published from 1982 to 1983. The Zoo Crew characters were created by Roy Thomas and Scott Shaw Although the series, which was the last original funny animal property to be created by DC Comics, proved short-lived, it is still fondly remembered by many comic fans of its generation, and the characters appear occasionally in cameos in the mainstream DC Universe (this is made possible due to the existence of a &quot;multiverse&quot; in the DCU, which allows the Zoo Crew characters to exist on a parallel Earth).

==Publication history==
The series was introduced in a 16-page insert in &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; #16 (February 1982). The series was cancelled after 20 issues, with six issues still in preparation. These six issues were eventually published in three double-sized issues as &quot;Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! in The Oz-Wonderland War&quot; #1-3, with the indicia title &quot;Oz-Wonderland Wars&quot; (plural). The series did not, in fact, depict a conflict between the Land of Oz and Wonderland, which plotter E. Nelson Bridwell considered antithetical to Ozite politics, but rather depicted the Nome King retrieving the magic belt and using his powers against both Oz and Wonderland, with the Zoo Crew coming in as reinforcements against him. The series was praised for its artwork, by Carol Lay, for its close emulation of the work of John R. Neill and Sir John Tenniel, but the story, scripted by Joey Cavalieri, was seen by many to be too close to the plot of &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; to reach its full potential. The series featured cameos from both Hoppy the Marvel Bunny and the Inferior Five.

A &quot;Showcase Presents&quot; reprinting of the entire series was slated for September 2007 but was postponed, along with several other &quot;Showcase&quot; editions, due to royalty issues in DC&#x27;s contracts of the 1980s. The book was finally released in September 2014. After years of absence, the Zoo Crew was reintroduced in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; (vol. 3) #30-31 (December 2005-January 2006). In October–December 2007, a three-issue miniseries called &quot;Captain Carrot and the Final Ark&quot; featured the Zoo Crew picking up from the &quot;Teen Titans&quot; storyline.

==Fictional history==
The origin of the team came about when Superman was investigating a strange phenomenon causing the citizens of Metropolis to begin acting like their primate ancestors. He determined the cause to be rays of energy originating from the planet Pluto. Flying towards outer space, he encountered an energy barrier around the Earth, but after noticing a meteor pass through unaffected, he grabbed the meteor and attempted to use it to get him through the barrier. When Superman and the meteor struck the barrier, they were both shunted into an alternative dimension of &quot;funny animals&quot;, later designated as Earth-C. There, Superman met several of the world&#x27;s residents, who gained superpowers after being struck by fragments of the meteor.

The animals and Superman soon teamed up to stop the source of the ray (which was also causing the denizens of Earth-C to behave like their non-anthropomorphic animal ancestors), which turned out to be the old Justice League villain Starro the Conqueror, a starfish-shaped alien, who was launching his de-evolution assault from the Earth-C universe&#x27;s Pluto. After defeating the villain, the animals decided to stick together and form the Zoo Crew, and Superman returned home.

Unlike many superhero teams, the Zoo Crew initially had considerable difficulty fighting as a unit. For instance, they would often take on a foe in pairs, and find themselves interfering with each other and being put out of action as a result. However, as the series progressed, the Zoo Crew persevered to develop their tactics in order to become a coherent fighting force.

===Earth-C===
The various members of the Zoo Crew lived on a parallel Earth that, during DC&#x27;s Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; multiverse system, was named Earth-C. Earth-C consisted of a world where various anthropomorphized talking animals existed; the series featured many animal-themed pun names for real-world aspects. For instance, the Zoo Crew operated out of &quot;Follywood, Califurnia&quot;, a parody of Hollywood, California. Similarly named Earth-C cities include &quot;Gnu York&quot; (New York City), &quot;Tallahatchee&quot; (Tallahassee, Florida), and &quot;Loondon&quot; (London). Countries on Earth-C include &quot;Cornada&quot; (Canada), and the &quot;United Species of America&quot; (United States of America); the capital of the United Species was &quot;Waspington, D.C.&quot; (Washington, D.C.).

The President of the United Species of America was &quot;Mallard Fillmore&quot; (a reference to the 13th president of the United States, Millard Fillmore). Other famous figures of Earth-C included &quot;Liz Whaler&quot; (Elizabeth Taylor), &quot;Marlin Brando&quot; (Marlon Brando), &quot;Byrd Rentals&quot; (Burt Reynolds) and &quot;Rova Barkitt&quot; (Rona Barrett) – the last two of whom became members of the Zoo Crew as Rubberduck and Yankee Poodle, respectively.

Historical figures and events on Earth-C also parallel those of the real world, including the &quot;Second Weird War&quot; (World War II; Earth-C&#x27;s version featured the U.S. and the Allies fighting the &quot;Ratzis&quot; (Nazis)) and President Abraham Linkidd (a goat, Earth-C&#x27;s version of Abraham Lincoln), who was immortalized in the nation&#x27;s capital in the &quot;Linkidd Memorial&quot;.

Earth-C&#x27;s population also consisted of the various &quot;funny animal&quot; characters that appeared in DC Comics over the years, particularly those in such Golden Age and Silver Age DC titles as &quot;Funny Stuff&quot;, &quot;The Dodo and the Frog&quot;, &quot;Real Screen Comics&quot;, and so forth. Indeed, several characters from these series made cameo appearances during the run of &quot;Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew!&quot;. One of those older characters, Peter Porkchops, was a member of the Zoo Crew itself as Pig-Iron. Reference was also made to Fastback&#x27;s uncle being Merton McSnurtle, a Golden Age funny animal superhero known as the Terrific Whatzit.

Eventually, readers (and the Zoo Crew) were introduced to the parallel Earth of &quot;Earth-C-Minus&quot;, which turned out to be the home of the &quot;Just&#x27;a Lotta Animals&quot; (a parody of the Justice League of America) and whose world was an all-animal reflection of the universe of Earth-One in the original DC Multiverse.

Following &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, it was stated that the universes of Earth-C and Earth-C-Minus were dimensions rather than universes, and thus were not affected by the Crisis. The miniseries &quot;The Kingdom&quot; presented Earth-C as a Hypertime reality.

==Zoo Crew reunited==
In &quot;Teen Titans&quot; (vol. 3) #30-31 (December 2005-January 2006), the Zoo Crew made their first return appearance in some time, in stories presented as excerpts from a comic book story &quot;Whatever Happened to Captain Carrot?&quot; that Kid Devil reads in #30. In these excerpts, the Zoo Crew is shown to have mostly disbanded and now lives in a &quot;darker&quot; world than in their prior adventures. Little Cheese is dead. Yankee Poodle has lost her secret identity and is a fugitive from the law, accused of trying to assassinate President Mallard Fillmore. Fastback has disappeared, Pig-Iron and Rubberduck operate as underground superheroes against the current anti-superhero law and Captain Carrot is in self-imposed retirement after the death of his partner, Carrie Carrot, at the hands (or paws) of Armordillo and Frogzilla. He has not left his apartment in years, and drinks heavily out of guilt over Carrie&#x27;s death. The only Zoo Crew member prospering is Alley-Kat Abra, who has revealed her identity publicly and become a world-famous magician. The story is a parody of the grim and gritty trend most often identified with the late 1980s to early 1990s superhero comics, and it includes references to several of DC&#x27;s own series (such as &quot;Batman: The Dark Knight Returns&quot; and &quot;Watchmen&quot;, including the cover of the &quot;Captain Carrot&quot; comic, which bears a resemblance to the cover of &quot;Watchmen&quot; #1).

A new hero, the American Eagle, overhears Pig-Iron, Rubberduck and Yankee Poodle at the scene of Little Cheese&#x27;s murder when they decide to regroup in order to avenge him. Acting independently of them, he confronts Roger Rodney Rabbit and bullies him into becoming Captain Carrot again. The others are disappointed when Abra refuses to rejoin the team, but rejoice when the American Eagle brings Captain Carrot back to them. Their investigation reveals that the crimes against their members are connected. The president bribed Alley-Kat-Abra to reveal all of the Zoo Crew&#x27;s secrets to the government; she took the money and made herself rich and famous. She banished Fastback into the future, killed Little Cheese and framed Yankee Poodle for the crime when she got too close to finding out what had happened to Fastback. When Alley-Kat-Abra is arrested for murdering Little Cheese, she tells them that she did it simply because she is a cat and cats hate mice. The Zoo Crew inducts the American Eagle as their newest member and heads into the future to retrieve Fastback. Issue #31 was drawn by ghost artist Scott Roberts. Many fans spotted the difference and complained. Scott Shaw had, in fact, drawn the pages, before DC&#x27;s switch to another artist.

===&quot;Countdown&quot;===
The Zoo Crew returned in a &quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot; tie-in entitled &quot;Captain Carrot and the Final Ark&quot; #1-3 (October–December 2007). In the new DC Multiverse, the Zoo Crew now resides on Earth-26. It is revealed that they enlisted the aid of Chip Hunter, Time Master in a successful rescue of Fastback from the future. They returned to their own time to find major changes. President Mallard Fillmore&#x27;s bribing of Alley-Kat-Abra was revealed and he resigned in shame. Vice President Beneduck Arnold took over and promptly created the Collar I.D. Initiative (a parody of the Superhuman Registration Act storyline of Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Civil War&quot; crossover event), which required that all superheroes reveal their secret identities to the government and wear identity collars. The government immediately stopped funding the Zoo Crew, and they were forced to leave their headquarters and all of the equipment that came with it. The Zoo Crew officially resisted the Collar I.D. Initiative and refused to sign up, but fought crime on the sly.

The Zoo Crew members restored both their civilian and their superhero identities. Rodney Rabbit regained his status as a comic book artist/writer, but he had to stop writing &quot;Just&#x27;a Lotta Animals&quot;. Their attorney presented him with a cease and desist order, and he complied. Fastback started The World&#x27;s Fastest Delivery Service. Rubberduck&#x27;s acting career as Byrd Rentals was all but over, but he did get a reality TV show featuring him and other washed-up actors. The American Eagle continued his radio career as Johnny Jingo, &quot;the radio talk show host with two right wings&quot;. Pig-Iron got a job working on an oil derrick, and Yankee Poodle became the highest-rated talk show host in the business after she was exonerated of all charges.

The Zoo Crew operated briefly in defiance of the new law in a battle with the Salamandroid (at a comic book convention where Roger Rodney Rabbit was on a writers&#x27; panel) and again when they learn of a threat to destroy Gnu York&#x27;s greatest landmarks. Frogzilla reappears in a dumbed-down state (reminiscent of the &quot;Hulk smash!&quot; version of the Hulk) and battles the Zoo Crew. During the fight, he swallows Pig-Iron. He is manipulated into vomiting Pig-Iron into a particular building, which houses a dimensional warp. The crash frees Alley-Kat-Abra from a netherworld. After defeating Frogzilla, Abra tells her former teammates that she was imprisoned there by Dark Alley, an evil version of herself created by the Just&#x27;a Lotta Animals foe Feline Faust. Dark Alley was the one who killed Little Cheese and framed Yankee Poodle for the crime. Pig-Iron vouches for her and tells them that she contacted him telepathically from the netherworld while he was in Frogzilla&#x27;s belly and told him her escape plan. The team accepts her back as a probationary member (until they are sure that they can trust her again) and they promptly go to search for the Salamandroid&#x27;s base under the ocean. Starro the Conqueror surprises them and uses his starfish duplicates to make them forget how to use their powers. Only Pig-Iron escaped - he could not go underwater for fear of rusting.

Starro works with Rash Al Paca to flood Earth-26 so that he can rule it. After President Arnold reveals that the ID collars have eliminated the powers of every superhero on Earth-26, the Zoo Crew summons the Just&#x27;a Lotta Animals for help. Green Lambkin leads a JLA team (consisting of Hawkmoose, the Elon-Gator, the Crash, the Batmouse and Zap-Panda) to help. Unable to stop the flood, the animal heroes evacuate a number of Gnu Yorkers using an ocean liner called &quot;Boa&#x27;s Ark&quot; As Pig-Iron stays behind battling Starro hoof to tentacle. Others combine their powers to transport the ship full of refugees to Earth-C-Minus. En route, the JLA encounters Muttron, Lightstray and Orihound of the New Dogs; while the two groups face off, the cruise ship is accidentally sucked into the New Dogs&#x27; Kaboom Tube and sent to New Earth. Zatanna and Hawkgirl encounter the ship and help it land safely, but all of the passengers, including the Zoo Crew, have turned into ordinary, non-anthropomorphic animals. Zatanna then takes the transformed Captain to participate in her stage show, as the other transformed Zoo Crew members look on, helplessly.

===&quot;Final Crisis&quot;===
In the climactic battle in &quot;Final Crisis&quot; #7, Monitor Nix Uotan restores the Zoo Crew to their old anthropomorphic forms.

===&quot;Convergence&quot;===
During DC&#x27;s Convergence crossover event of 2015, various members of the Zoo Crew team up with Harley Quinn and Wally West in staged fights to save their respected worlds all to the amusement of Brainiac.

==Team members==
The members of the Zoo Crew include:
*Roger Rodney Rabbit / Captain Carrot: A rabbit from Gnu York and leader of the team, who is often called Rodney to avoid confusion with the title character of the film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;. He possesses powers similar to Superman which are derived from carrots imbued with the meteor&#x27;s energy. In his alter ego, Rodney was the writer and artist of the comic book &quot;Just&#x27;a Lotta Animals&quot; until it was cancelled after a copyright lawsuit. His Earth-26 counterpart is a member of the Justice League Incarnate.
*Felina Furr / Alley-Kat-Abra: A cat from Mew Orleans, martial arts instructor, and student of the mystical arts. She wields a magic wand that was originally a stirring stick before being imbued with the meteor&#x27;s power.
*Peter Porkchops / Pig-Iron: A pig from Piggsburgh who was transformed into living iron after being struck by a meteor fragment and falling into a vat of metal in the steel mill where he worked. He was originally created for &quot;Leading Comics&quot;.
*Byrd Rentals / Rubberduck: A duck actor from Follywood, Califurnia who gained elasticity. His name is a parody of actor Burt Reynolds.
*Rova Barkitt / Yankee Poodle: A poodle and gossip columnist who gained the ability to attract and repel other objects. Her name is a parody of gossip columnist Rona Barrett.
*Timmy Joe Terrapin / Fastback: A turtle from the Okey-Dokey swamp who gained &quot;superchelonian&quot; speed. His uncle Merton McSnurtle operated as the Terrific Whatzit during the Second Weird War and participated in &quot;Operation Overlard&quot;.
*Chester Cheese / Little Cheese: A mouse and student at Follywood High School who gained the ability to shrink after eating experimental lunar cheese. He later revealed his secret identity to the public and left the Zoo Crew to become a lawyer before being killed by &quot;Dark Alley&quot;, an evil version of Alley-Kat-Abra created by Feline Faust.
*Johnny Jingo / The American Eagle: An eagle and radio host who operates as a vigilante by night and replaced Little Cheese following his death. He is the only member who does not have superpowers, though he does use gadgets similar to those used by Batman.

In the story in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; (vol. 3) #30-31, deceased Earth-C meta-animals named (other than Little Cheese) include Carrie Carrot, Giant Giraffe, Marvel Bunny Jr., Ballistic Baboon, Amazing Ant, and Power Panda. These heroes may or may not have been former Zoo Crew members.

==Villains==
Enemies of the Zoo Crew include:
*Dr. Hoot: An owl who uses various scientific gadgets to commit crimes.
*Amazoo: An android from Earth-C-Minus that is a funny animal counterpart of the DC Comics villain Amazo; it has the abilities of all animals on Earth C-Minus.

*A.C.R.O.S.T.I.C.: A Cabal Recently Organized Solely To Instigate Crimes (as well as other variants designed to fit that particular acrostic), a secretive organization that plots to overthrow the American government.
*&quot;Feathers&quot; Fillmore / Brother Hood: A.C.R.O.S.T.I.C.&#x27;s shadowy leader, named for his black hood. He is President Mallard Fillmore&#x27;s criminally adept brother.

*Melvin McMole / Digger O&#x27;Doom: A mole who gains tremendous strength after eating one of Rodney&#x27;s cosmic carrots.
*Fennimore Frog / Frogzilla: Formerly a frog, he is turned into a giant frog by A.C.R.O.S.T.I.C. as a means of seeking revenge against his old foe, Dunbar Dodo. Both Fennimore and Dunbar originally appeared in DC&#x27;s &quot;funny animal&quot; title &quot;The Dodo and the Frog&quot;.
*Feline Faust: A cat sorcerer from Earth-C-Minus that is a funny animal counterpart of the DC Comics villain Felix Faust. His servitor, &quot;Dark Alley&quot;, later killed Little Cheese and framed Yankee Poodle for the crime.
*Gorilla Grodd: The brilliant, mind-controlling gorilla once transported himself to Earth-C, only to be defeated by the Zoo Crew and the Changeling.

*Starro the Conqueror: An alien starfish and an enemy of the Justice League of America. After a past battle between the JLA and Starro on Earth-One in the original DC Multiverse, a severed piece of Starro falls through a chartreuse hole and regenerates into a new Starro on Earth-C, although this version&#x27;s motives and tactics are somewhat different from the original Starro. He was the Zoo Crew&#x27;s first opponent, and most recently appeared in &quot;Captain Carrot and the Final Ark&quot; #1-3.
*A. &quot;Wolfie&quot; Wolfe / The Wuz-Wolf: A wolf who was formerly Peter Porkchop&#x27;s neighbor, Wolfe became the villainous character after acquiring a talisman that contained some of the steel that Peter had fallen into and given him his powers (thus containing some of the meteor fragment as well). He is Earth-C&#x27;s version of a werewolf (depicted here as a human being, a mythical creature on Earth-C); in this case, having suffered from the compulsion to eat Peter in his youth (which he got psychiatric help for), Wolfe acted on this impulse as the Wuz-Wolf and was left disgusted after the Zoo Crew managed to cure him. 
*Alfred E. Newgator / Mudd: An alligator and distant relative of Fastback who went treasure hunting in the Okey-Dokey Swamp in 1923 and died when he stepped into a quicksand bog. Years later, a movie was shot in the swamp and a barrel of gloop makeup was dumped in the bog where Alfred&#x27;s bones lay, creating a mud monster dubbed Mudd. 
*Polly Wannacracker / The Squawker: A parrot rival of Rova Barkitt, Polly crashed into a radio broadcasting tower and gained a sonic scream. 
*Salvador Doggi / Debbil Dog: A chihuahua painter who turned to dark magic to regain his creative spark, only to accidentally create an interdimensional gateway and was sucked into his painting.

After a lengthy fight, Alley-Kat-Abra created a portal, which Debbil Dog planned to destroy so that she would trapped and unable to stop him. However, the portal was fake and Alley-Kat-Abra was able to escape through a real one. The painting was then destroyed, trapping Debbil Dog forever. Debbil Dog could warp reality and wielded a trident, A Brush with Disaster. 
*Cheshire Cheetah: A British cheetah who gained superspeed from a constant diet of fast food. After failing to outrun Fastback, the Cheshire Cheetah attempted to escape via a stolen prototype jetpack, only to be blasted into space. 
*Fatkat: A cat crime boss who wanted Chester Cheese to throw a basketball game. When he refused, Fatkat had Chester&#x27;s father killed and him locked in his father&#x27;s vault which resulted in Chester eating the moon cheese and becoming Little Cheese. Fatkat was eventually defeated by Little Cheese with help from the Zoo Crew. 
*Starski N. Hatch / The Screeching Tire: A hamster piloting a giant wheel called the Treadnaught. He was a special effects technician for Steven Spielbird-Dog&#x27;s movies and was mad that he never received any credit for it. Steven filmed his rampages and offered to make Hatch his next big star.

<text>A precanceled stamp, or precancel for short, is a postage stamp that has been legitimately cancelled before being affixed to mail. A number of nations of the world use precancels, typically in the form of an overprint on definitive series stamps.

==Use==
Precanceled stamps are typically used by mass mailers, who can save the postal system time and effort by prearranging to use the precancels, and delivering the stamped mail ready for sorting. The postal administration will typically offer an incentive in the form of a reduced price for precanceled stamps in volume. Precancels cannot normally be purchased by the general public, although they are often seen in one&#x27;s daily mail.

==History==
===Canada===
Canada used precancels from 1889 to 1982. Initially, they consisted only of waves and bars applied with ink roller, but the town and province was added in 1903, similar to in the United States. In 1922, the precancel was changed to three pairs of horizontal bars. In the 1930s, town names were replaced with a corresponding numeral of either four numbers or three numbers preceded by an &#x27;X&#x27;.

===France===
Widespread French use of precancels began in 1920 with cancels including the year and city. This was scrapped in 1922 in favour of a standard overprint in a semicircle reading &quot;AFFRANCHts. POSTES&quot; (Affranchissements Postes).

During their time as French colonies, Algeria and Tunisia also issued precancels.

===Monaco===
Monaco has issued precancels since 1943, with an identical overprint to that of France.

===United Nations===
The United Nations Postal Administration has only issued one precancel, a 1½ cent stamp used from 1952 to 1959.

===United States===

The first use of precancels (both in the US and globally) was by Hale &amp; Co., an independent mail company in the United States in the 1840s which undercut the expensive United States Post Office Department (POD). The first precancels were created in 1843 or early 1844 and their complexity varies; most were &quot;crude straight lines&quot; across the stamps, but examples from Portsmouth, New Hampshire were precanceled with &quot;P / N.H.&quot; in block letters. Hale &amp; Co., along with all other independent mail carriers, was shut down by an 1845 act of Congress.

The POD authorised precanceling of stamps in 1887, and produced standardised guidelines on their design in May 1903. US precancels are generally divided into two groups: Bureaus and Locals. Locals, used unofficially since the 1840s, were prepared by postmasters using stamps and equipment they had on hand. Bureaus are those manufactured by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which came into use in the 1910s.

Precancels are known from over 20,000 towns across all 50 states, Guam, Puerto Rico and American Samoa.

===Postal training===
Around the early twentieth century, some U.S. business colleges used specially pre-cancelled stamps or stamp-like labels to train students in the handling of stamps. Precancels were also used to train Post Office employees in the United Kingdom.

==Study==
The &quot;Precancel Gazette&quot;, a magazine for precancel collectors, was first published in 1919 and the &quot;Black Book&quot;, a catalog of US precancel stamps, was first published in 1940. The Precancel Stamp Society, formed in 1922 from two previously-existing clubs, specializes in the study of precancels. A number of catalogs list all the types of precancels issued in the countries that use them.

<doc id="559370" wikidata="Q7614564" url="?curid=559370" title="Steven Ciobo">
<text>Steven Michele Ciobo ( ) (born 29 May 1974) is a retired Australian politician who represented the Division of Moncrieff in the House of Representatives from the 2001 federal election until his retirement at the 2019 election. He was a member of the Liberal National Party of Queensland, and sat with the Liberal Party in federal parliament. On 1 March 2019 Ciobo announced his decision to retire from politics at the 2019 federal election.

Ciobo served as the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment in the Turnbull government from February 2016 until his resignation on 21 August 2018 in the wake of the Liberal Party leadership spill earlier that day. He went on to serve as Minister for Defence Industry, working in conjunction with the Defence Minister, until his resignation in March 2019. He previously served as Minister for International Development and the Pacific from September 2015 to February 2016, and earlier as a parliamentary secretary in the Abbott government from September 2013 to September 2015 (initially to the Treasurer and later to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Trade and Investment).

==Early life and education==
Ciobo was born and raised in Mareeba, North Queensland, the youngest of three children in an Anglican family. His parents, Bruno and Joan, ran a tourism business in Cairns. Ciobo&#x27;s father was born in Bari, Italy, while his paternal grandfather was born in Valona (modern Vlorë), Ottoman Empire. His maternal grandfather was born in London.

Ciobo graduated in law and commerce from Bond University and earned a master&#x27;s degree in law from the Queensland University of Technology. He worked at a food processing factory to help support himself while studying. While at university he reportedly considered joining Australia&#x27;s domestic intelligence agency, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). Before entering parliament, Ciobo worked as a consultant with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, as a senior consultant with PricewaterhouseCoopers, and as an adviser to Senator Brett Mason.

== Political career ==
===Howard government (2001–07)===
Ciobo was elected to parliament at the 2001 federal election, replacing the retiring Kathy Sullivan in the Division of Moncrieff.

Ciobo has repeatedly called for the introduction of daylight saving for South East Queensland, despite this position being at odds of that of some of his Liberal National Party colleagues in the Queensland Parliament.

In 2005, he urged the government to change the law to strip naturalised Australians of their citizenship if they incite, support or engage in terrorist activity. In 2006, Ciobo called for the first home owner grant to be doubled, a policy which was adopted by the Rudd government in October 2008 as an economic stimulus measure.

In the lead up to the 2007 federal election, responding to a dare from a local radio station, Ciobo and his wife were thrown into the air on a sling shot bungee at the Surfers Paradise Adrenalin Park. While hurled up in the air, Ciobo&#x27;s wife spotted one of her husband&#x27;s stolen election signs on the balcony of a Surfers Paradise apartment. The radio station has since posted a video of the dare on YouTube.

===Opposition (2007–13)===
After the Coalition lost the 2007 election, Ciobo was made Shadow Minister for Small Business, the Service Economy and Tourism in the Shadow Cabinet of Brendan Nelson. Nelson promoted him into the shadow ministry despite Ciobo publicly pledging his support for Nelson&#x27;s opponent, Malcolm Turnbull, in the previous month&#x27;s leadership ballot. Ciobo was critical of the merger of the Liberal and National parties in Queensland, telling ABC Local Radio in July 2008: &quot;I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s going to have a positive effect on a federal level. But at a state level it certainly is going to make a very big difference.&quot;

When Turnbull replaced Nelson as leader in September 2008, Ciobo&#x27;s portfolio was changed to Shadow Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors, Tourism and the Arts. In December 2009, Tony Abbott won a leadership ballot to replace Turnbull as Leader of the Opposition. He subsequently demoted Ciobo to the outer frontbench, as the Shadow Minister for Tourism and the Arts and the Shadow Minister for Youth and Sport.

In September 2010, shortly after the 2010 federal election, Opposition Leader Tony Abbott removed Ciobo from the shadow ministry, relegating him to the backbench. Abbott refused to answer questions on the reason for Ciobo&#x27;s demotion, other than to say: &quot;There is something of the quality of snakes and ladders about the business of politics.&quot; In an article in The Australian, contributing editor Peter van Onselen speculated the reasons for Ciobo&#x27;s demotion were that &quot;Abbott has never especially gotten along with Ciobo personally&quot; and that Ciobo was &quot;a Malcolm Turnbull lieutenant.&quot; Van Onselen said the demotion reflected poorly on Abbott because Ciobo is &quot;talented, a good media performer and part of the next generation in the Liberal Party.&quot;

In November 2009, Ciobo introduced his first private members bill as a shadow minister. The bill proposed changes to the government&#x27;s producer offset to encourage more local feature film production.

In November 2008, Ciobo attacked the Rudd government over Peter Garrett&#x27;s decision to axe funding for the Australian National Academy of Music, saying the decision was &quot;the latest chapter in bungled Labor decisions that have ended one of Australia&#x27;s centres of excellence and left students&#x27; futures in limbo&quot;. He also said Garrett&#x27;s move to scrap the Uluru climb would be another setback to the tourism industry which had been affected by the Great Recession. In April 2011, Ciobo called for a radical rethink of the tourism strategy for the Gold Coast, calling on the city to focus on more casinos and glitz. He said turning Surfers Paradise into a world-class entertainment precinct to rival Las Vegas and Macau was the solution to save the Gold Coast from rising unemployment and economic doom.

In 2011 Ciobo and Labor MP Kelvin Thomson were seconded to the United Nations in New York City for 12 weeks.

Ciobo was a prominent opponent of Andrew Wilkie&#x27;s plan (initially adopted by the Gillard government but later shelved) to require all poker machine players to set a daily betting limit. He told a Queensland newspaper the plan &quot;will place the entire population that want to have a $10 flutter within arms&#x27; reach of big brother government.&quot;

In an opinion piece he wrote for ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Drum&quot; in June 2011, Ciobo declared he was a libertarian who would &quot;attempt to persuasively argue the need for less regulation.&quot; In the article he said that &quot;like the Tassie Tiger, personal responsibility has died out&quot; and that &quot;increasingly, I find myself thinking it is not this new law that is required, rather, it is a good dose of &#x27;toughen up and stop blaming others for your bad decision&#x27;.&quot;

===Abbott government (2013–15)===

On 18 September 2013 Ciobo was appointed the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Joe Hockey. He was also appointed as Australia&#x27;s alternate governor to the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Ciobo was given responsibility for the Foreign Investment Review Board, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Royal Australian Mint, the National Housing Supply Council and the Australian Valuation Office. Since his appointment, Ciobo has abolished both the National Housing Supply Council, saying the council&#x27;s activities were &quot;no longer needed&quot;; and the Australian Valuation Office, saying &quot;a compelling case for the Commonwealth providing its own valuation services no longer exists, particularly given there is a highly competitive market of private sector providers&quot;; and announced plans to privatise the Royal Australian Mint.

In December 2014, Ciobo was appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and to the Minister for Trade and Investment.

====Zaky Mallah incident====
In June 2015, Ciobo was part of an ABC Q&amp;A panel when he was asked a question from a member of the live audience. The questioner, Zaky Mallah, was the first to be charged under new anti-terrorism laws in 2003, and had been found not guilty after spending two years in a correctional facility pending trial. Mallah asked Ciobo a question that had been pre-approved by the ABC: &quot;What would have happened if my [terrorism] case had been decided by the Minister and not the courts?&quot; Ciobo responded that he understood Mallah&#x27;s acquittal had been on a technicality, and he would be happy to see the government remove Mallah from Australia. Mallah later was given an opportunity to respond, and stated &quot;The Liberals now have just justified to many Australian Muslims in the community tonight to leave and go to Syria and join ISIS because of ministers like him.&quot; Moderator Tony Jones called these comments &quot;totally out of order&quot;. Mallah later wrote, in Comment is free, that he &quot;hates ISIS&quot; and his comments were &quot;misinterpreted&quot;.

Following this incident, the ABC reported that it had received over 1,000 complaints about Zaky Mallah&#x27;s presence in the audience, while Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott condemned the ABC - asking &quot;which side is the ABC on?&quot; and accusing it of having &#x27;betrayed&#x27; Australia. Abbott subsequently banned front bench members of his government from appearing on Q&amp;A, demanding that the show be moved to another part of the ABC&#x27;s editorial programming. When the ABC met Abbott&#x27;s demands, accusations were made by an ABC &#x27;source&#x27; that this was &quot;the biggest example of editorial interference I&#x27;ve ever heard of&quot;.

===Turnbull government (2015–2018)===

Ciobo reportedly supported Malcolm Turnbull in the 2015 leadership spill that saw Tony Abbott replaced as leader. He was subsequently made Minister for International Development and the Pacific – a new position – in the first Turnbull Ministry. Following the retirement of Andrew Robb in February 2016, he was promoted to Minister for Trade and Investment. His title was altered to Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment in July 2016.

In early 2016, Ciobo publicly opposed Sydney&#x27;s lock-out laws. Confronted with statistics of a 42.2% drop in assaults after Sydney instated lock-out laws, he responded &quot;Well how does that sit with the way in which patronage is down? I heard someone quip, &#x27;well there were 0 assaults in the Simpson desert too.&#x27;&quot;

Ciobo ran in the August 2018 Deputy Liberal Party leadership spill Minister for the Environment and Energy Josh Frydenberg won a majority in the first round with 46 votes, while Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment Steven Ciobo received 20 and Minister for Health Greg Hunt received 16.

On 1 March 2019 Ciobo announced his decision to retire from politics at the next federal election.

==Post-politics==
Ciobo advised Bain Capital on its 2020 acquisition of Virgin Australia. He subsequently joined private equity firm Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners, based in New York as a managing director with responsibility for &quot;global affairs and engagement&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Ciobo is married with two children and lives on the Gold Coast. In 2010, he told a newspaper his happiest moment was when his son, who was born with a heart condition, came through a five-and-a-half-hour operation well. His wife, Astra Ciobo, is a successful businesswoman who co-founded a Gold Coast public relations firm.

<doc id="559374" wikidata="Q663754" url="?curid=559374" title="Gravity Kills">
<text>Gravity Kills is an American industrial rock band from St. Louis, Missouri, formed in 1994. After releasing three albums, they disbanded in 2003, followed by reunions from 2005 to 2012, and another in 2023.

After a brief period on the regional scene, the band signed to TVT Records in late 1995. Gravity Kills first gained mainstream attention via their 1996 self-titled debut album, which contained the single &quot;Guilty&quot;. &quot;Guilty&quot; peaked at No. 86 on the US Hot 100 Chart and at No. 79 on the UK Singles Chart. Ultimately, the &quot;Gravity Kills&quot; album sold approximately 500,000 copies. Their follow-up album in 1998, &quot;Perversion&quot;, was less successful than its predecessor, although &quot;Falling&quot; appeared on the US Mainstream Rock Chart. Gravity Kills switched to the Sanctuary Records label for their third and final album in 2002, &quot;Superstarved&quot;. Although the lead single &quot;One Thing&quot; was the band&#x27;s highest position on the US Mainstream Rock Chart (No. 24), they disbanded in January 2003 due to a lack of label support and internal issues. They played various one-off shows between 2005 and 2012, followed by a second reunion in 2023.

Their music was described by one critic as &quot;a blending of eerie industrial rock with a pop-infused melodic chorus and a bit of hard-core head banging.&quot; Overall, Gravity Kills&#x27; songs have been featured on soundtracks for a variety of media, such as &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, &quot;Se7en&quot;, &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot;, and &quot;Kissing a Fool&quot;, in addition to video games such as the &quot;Test Drive&quot; franchise. Gravity Kills toured with a mixture of bands during their first run, such as Sex Pistols, Sevendust, Local H, Flaw, Sister Machine Gun, and Pigface.

== History ==
=== Formation, name, and self-titled debut album (1994–1996) ===

As the band was forming in 1994, keyboardist Doug Firley was reading an article where he misread what he thought said &quot;like the Gravity Kills.&quot; He went back through the article and could not find what he thought he had read. Firley told drummer Kurt Kerns and guitarist Matt Dudenhoeffer about it and thought that Gravity Kills would be a great name for the band.

In response to a contest from St. Louis area radio station KPNT for a compilation CD of local artists, the trio brought in vocalist Jeff Scheel (Kerns&#x27; cousin) to record and mix a track in one week during the summer of 1994. The resulting song, &quot;Guilty&quot;, was given heavy airplay and quickly became the most requested song at the station. The band continued to write and record songs throughout 1995.

Although nearly an entire year had passed since &quot;Guilty&quot; was first released, Gravity Kills finally played their first live show in November 1995 at a soldout venue in St. Louis. Later that month, the band officially signed a record deal with TVT Records. The band&#x27;s first self-titled album was released in March 1996, and peaked at No. 89 on the Billboard 200 chart and No. 1 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. &quot;Guilty&quot;, the first single, found heavy airplay upon its release. It peaked at No. 24 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart, No. 39 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart, and at No. 86 on the Billboard 100 chart. Videos were made for &quot;Guilty&quot;, &quot;Enough&quot;, and &quot;Down&quot;. &quot;Enough&quot; in particular had peaked at No. 98 on the UK Singles Chart. Hollywood also embraced the band&#x27;s music as they landed songs on three high profile soundtracks: &quot;Se7en&quot; with &quot;Guilty&quot;, &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; with &quot;Goodbye (Demo Version)&quot;, and &quot;Escape From L.A.&quot; with &quot;Blame (L.A. Remix)&quot;. The band partially re-recorded the song &quot;Blame&quot; for the &quot;Escape From L.A.&quot; soundtrack, and it was released as an individual single.

Gravity Kills toured in the summer of 1996 with the Sex Pistols and embarked on a solo tour that fall. With the success of the first album, the band quickly established itself on the rock scene as one of the most promising young bands in the industrial music scene. Gravity Kills&#x27; album was also released worldwide with chart success in England, Germany, and France.

===&quot;Manipulated&quot;, live tours, and &quot;Perversion&quot; (1997–2000)===
In 1997, TVT Records released a remix compilation album called &quot;Manipulated&quot; which contained remixes from the band&#x27;s self-titled debut album songs &quot;Guilty&quot;, &quot;Blame&quot;, &quot;Enough&quot;, &quot;Down&quot;, and &quot;Here&quot;. That year, they contributed a song to the Gary Numan tribute album &quot;Random&quot;, &quot;Poetry and Power&quot;. Gravity Kills also briefly collaborated with the musician Moby on a song titled &quot;Suffocating&quot;. It was meant to be included on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Spawn&quot;; however, Moby disliked the outcome, and instead worked with Butthole Surfers for the soundtrack. The outtake was later released online.
On April 19, 1998, Scheel suffered a whiplash when he got overexcited during a warm-up gig at the University Wellness &amp; Activities in San Antonio, Texas. He had not performed live with the band since a previous live concert at the Q101 Festival in Chicago, IL on October 16, 1997. The injury happened at a club in what was supposed to be a low-key gig that attracted 6,000 fans, according to the band&#x27;s label, TVT Records. The injury, which put Scheel out of commission for a few weeks, came less than a week before Junkie XL leader Tom Holkenborg injured his back in an onstage accident; ironically, Junkie XL and Gravity Kills were scheduled to join British band Pitchshifter on a U.S. tour on June 3.

The band released their second studio album in June 1998, titled &quot;Perversion&quot;. The album was less successful than their self-titled debut but still sold well, peaking at No. 107 on the Billboard 200 chart. The single &quot;Falling&quot; peaked at No. 35 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart, and was featured in the 1998 racing video game &quot;Test Drive 5&quot; along with Pitchshifter, Fear Factory, Junkie XL, and KMFDM. &quot;Alive&quot; and &quot;Drown&quot; also appeared in another game from the same franchise in 1998, &quot;Test Drive Off-Road 2&quot;. On July 1, 1998, at the Summerfest in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Scheel got the whole crowd chanting &quot;Fuck you!&quot; while the show was being broadcast live on a mainstream rock local radio station, Lazer 103 FM. This was a familiar phrase to the July 2, 1997, Summerfest. The station&#x27;s DJ tried to get the crowd to stop, but he was having mic problems and the crowd ignored him. In August 1999, drummer Kerns had left the band, reasons for leaving as a chance for him to spend time with his family and to return to practicing architecture. He was initially replaced by Greg Miller (who played with another St. Louis band, Radio Iodine). After a handful of shows in 2000, Brad Booker (former drummer for the band Stir) joined on drums.

===&quot;Superstarved&quot;, Doug Firley&#x27;s injury, and split-up (2001–2003)===
After the release of &quot;Perversion&quot;, numerous recording sessions commenced for the third album between June 1999 and August 2001. An entire tracklist was completed; however, the band was dissatisfied with the mixes and returned to the studio. Gravity Kills also signed with their new label Sanctuary Records. The initial sessions would later be leaked online (by Scheel himself), which also contained six songs that had not made the final album&#x27;s cut.

In March 2002, Sanctuary Records released the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Superstarved&quot;. The UK version of the album was released by Mayan Records (which was a part of Sanctuary Records) and the Japan version of the album was released by Victor Entertainment. The single &quot;One Thing&quot; had charted at No. 24 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart, the band&#x27;s highest position to date. Gravity Kills co-headlined a tour with American Head Charge in promotion of the album throughout April. The following month, on May 2, keyboardist Firley sustained serious injury to his hand in Allentown, Pennsylvania while performing in front of a sold-out crowd. The injury occurred when Firley dropped the 300 pound custom-made spring-loaded steel keyboard on his hand, shattering the bones in his right ring finger during the band&#x27;s performance of their single &quot;One Thing&quot;. The band returned home to St. Louis after finishing the weekend shows in New Jersey and New York for Firley to seek treatment and had to sell off the components of the recording studio it owned, thus ending the cycle of tour dates. Firley later underwent surgery to fix his hand.

On January 4, 2003, the band officially broke up, a statement posted on the site read as follows:

The band members scattered to different occupations. Matt Dudenhoeffer returned to an engineering job outside of the music industry. Doug Firley went on tour with Alicia Keys as a keyboard tech and then worked as a draftsman before forming the production team Shock City Productions with Chris Loesch. Brad Booker became the new drummer for the band Apartment 26, and later reunited with his previous band Stir on multiple occasions. Jeff Scheel went to work at the Box Talent Agency as an agent for corporations, casinos, and clubs. Scheel was also the vocalist of a band called Star 13 (stylized as *13).

=== Reformation, performances, and abandoned fourth studio album (2005–2012) ===
On October 28, 2005, Gravity Kills reunited to perform for a self-created Halloween music festival in St. Louis, Missouri entitled The Killoween Freakshow. It was initially to be an annual event, as another Killoween occurred on October 28, 2006, at Pop&#x27;s Nightclub and Bar. Due to a scheduling conflict, Killoween was instead The Nightmare Before Thanksgiving on November 21, 2007. Gravity Kills confirmed rumors that had persisted over the past year on October 20, 2009, and the band announced that they were working on new music.

The band performed in Tulsa at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino on May 7, 2010, and at Roberts Orpheum Theater in St. Louis, MO on June 25, 2010, as part of a benefit show. The band was working on a follow-up album, as they maintained an online diary regarding their progress. They revealed a working title for one of the songs, &quot;Again&quot;.

=== Vinyl reissue and future plans (2018–present) ===

On December 13, 2018, Gravity Kills noted on their official Facebook page that the last time the band had performed together was on November 23, 2012, at The Pageant in St. Louis, Missouri. The band was considered to be in hiatus, but in November 2022 they previewed a vinyl reissue of their self-titled debut album. The post displayed the tentative vinyl packaging and no release date was given at that point. The vinyl pressing of &quot;Gravity Kills&quot; was eventually released on May 19, 2023. Not long after, the band announced a reunion show in St. Louis for November 11, 2023; thus, it became their first live show in 11 years.

William de Valence (died 13 June 1296), born Guillaume de Lusignan, was a French nobleman and knight who became important in English politics due to his relationship to King Henry III of England. He was heavily involved in the Second Barons&#x27; War, supporting the king and Prince Edward against the rebels led by Simon de Montfort. He took the name de Valence (&quot;of Valence&quot;) after his birthplace, the Cistercian abbey of Valence, near Lusignan in Poitou.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=78}}

== Biography ==
William de Valence was the fourth son of Isabella of Angoulême, widow of King John, and her second husband, Hugh X of Lusignan, Count of La Marche, and was thus a half-brother to Henry III, and uncle to Edward I. William was born in the {{ill|lt=Cistercian abbey in Valence|Valence Abbey|fr|Abbaye de Valence}}, Couhé-Vérac, Vienne, Poitou-Charentes, near Lusignan, sometime in the late 1220s (his elder sister Alice was born in 1224).

=== Move to England ===

The French conquest of Poitou in 1246 created great difficulties for William&#x27;s family, and so he and his brothers, Guy de Lusignan and Aymer, accepted Henry III&#x27;s invitation to come to England in 1247.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=78}} The king found important positions for all of them; William was soon married to a great heiress, Joan de Munchensi or Munchensy (c. 1230 – after 20 September 1307), the only surviving child of Warin de Munchensy, lord of Swanscombe, and his first wife Joan Marshal, who was one of the five daughters of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke and Isabel de Clare, 4th Countess of Pembroke &quot;suo jure&quot;. As an eventual co-heiress of the Marshal estates, Joan de Munchensi&#x27;s portion included the castle and lordship of Pembroke and the lordship erected earldom of Wexford in Ireland. The custody of Joan&#x27;s property was entrusted to her husband,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=78}} who apparently assumed the lordships of Pembroke and Wexford between 1250 and 1260. In 1304, after William&#x27;s death, Joan is found vigorously asserting her rights in her lordship of Wexford, appealing directly to the king against a Cort order dispossessing her of her lands there.

=== Second Barons&#x27; War ===
This favouritism to royal relatives was unpopular with many of the English nobility, a discontent which would culminate in the Second Barons&#x27; War. It did not take long for William to make enemies in England. From his new lands in South Wales, he tried to regain the palatine rights which had been attached to the Earldom of Pembroke, but his energies were not confined to this. The king heaped lands and honours upon him, and he was soon thoroughly hated as one of the most prominent of the rapacious foreigners. Moreover, some trouble in Wales led to a quarrel between him and Simon de Montfort, who was to become the figurehead for the rebels. He refused to comply with the provisions imposed on the king at Oxford in 1258, and took refuge in Wolvesey Castle at Winchester, where he was besieged and compelled to surrender and leave the country.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=79}}

In 1259 William and de Montfort were formally reconciled in Paris, and in 1261 Valence was again in England and once more enjoying the royal favour. He fought for Henry at the disastrous Battle of Lewes, and after the defeat again fled to France, while de Montfort ruled England. However, by 1265 he was back, landing in Pembrokeshire, and taking part in the siege of Gloucester and the final royalist victory at Evesham. After the battle he was restored to his estates and accompanied Prince Edward, afterwards Edward I, to Palestine.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=79}}

=== Welsh wars and death ===
From his base in Pembrokeshire, he was a mainstay of the English campaigns against Llywelyn ap Gruffudd and later Dafydd ap Gruffudd; in the war of 1282–3 that led to the conquest of Wales he negotiated the surrender of one of Dafydd&#x27;s last remaining castles, Castell-y-Bere, with its custodian, Cynfrig ap Madog.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} He also went several times to France on public business and he was one of Edward&#x27;s representatives in the famous suit over the succession to the crown of Scotland in 1291 and 1292.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=79}}

William de Valence died at Bayonne on the 13 June 1296, and his body was buried in splendour at Westminster Abbey.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=79}}

<doc id="559379" wikidata="Q15212701" url="?curid=559379" title="Commissioner of Nunavut">
<text>The commissioner of Nunavut (; Inuinnaqtun: &quot;Kamisinauyuq Nunavunmut&quot;; ) is the Government of Canada&#x27;s representative in the territory of Nunavut. The current commissioner since January 14, 2021 is Eva Aariak who served as Premier from 2008 to 2013.

The commissioner is appointed to represent the Canadian federal government and performs many of the same duties of lieutenant governors in Canadian provinces, such as swearing in members of the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut and approving territorial legislation. However, unlike a lieutenant governor or the governor general of Canada, the commissioner is not a viceroy and does not represent the Canadian monarch.

==History==
The position was created in 1999 with the creation of the new Nunavut territory. Like other territorial commissioners, the commissioner is appointed by the Government of Canada and represents the Canadian cabinet in the territory.

&quot;Note.&quot; Prior to April 1, 1999, Nunavut was part of the Northwest Territories. See Commissioners of Northwest Territories.

===Deputy commissioner===
The role of deputy commissioner was added in 2005 by amending the Public Officer Act and Seals Act to be inline with the Yukon and Northwest Territories.

==Duties==
The duties of the commissioner are similar to that of the lieutenant governors of the provinces. However, since commissioners represent the Government of Canada rather than the Crown, they are not viceroys.

<text>Irvington station is a commuter rail stop on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line, located in Irvington, New York.

==History==

The Hudson River Railroad reached the settlement by 1849; the first passengers on a regularly scheduled run through the village paid fifty cents to travel from Peekskill to Chambers Street in Manhattan on September 29, 1849. The community was in the process of renaming itself after author Washington Irving, despite the fact that he was still alive at the time. In 1852, Irvington was also named for the first coal-fueled steam locomotive of the Hudson River Railroad. The HRR was acquired by the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad in 1869, and the New York Central Railroad in 1913.

The existing station house was built in 1889 and designed by the Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge architectural firm. As with most of the stations along the Hudson Line, it was transformed into a Penn Central station when New York Central merged with the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968. Bankruptcy of the company followed by 1970, and Penn Central eventually turned passenger service over to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York, who made it part of Metro-North in 1983.

Irvington&#x27;s former New York Central Railroad station, built in 1889, has been a contributing property of the Irvington Historic District since January 15, 2014. Since being retired as a ticket office in 1957, it has been utilized as an art and curio shop, an office for the Weyerhauser lumber yard which was located on the other side of the tracks – now Scenic Hudson Park – and the office of an architectural firm. In 2016, with the addition of an outdoor garden, it was converted into a 20-seat café serving frozen yogurt.

==Station layout==
The station has two slightly offset high-level side platforms each eight cars long. Track 1 is only used by diesel trains since it does not have a third rail.

==History==
After its opening in 1967, the college joined the University of Nevada system in August 1969. Formerly, hopes for a college in Elko were fading in the spring of 1968 until a $250,000 donation was received from reclusive Las Vegas billionaire Howard Hughes. The gift was announced by Nevada Governor Paul Laxalt, who was heading the list of dignitaries, at an emotionally charged assembly of supporters at the Commercial Hotel.

==Academics==
The college offers baccalaureate and associate level instruction in career and technical education and academic areas. It offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees, Associate of Applied Science degrees, certificates, and short-term training programs. It also offers dual-credit enrollment programs for high school students in its areas of outreach in the cities of Elko, Ely, Winnemucca, and the town of Pahrump.

<doc id="559386" wikidata="Q6226446" url="?curid=559386" title="John Cobb (Australian politician)">
<text>John Kenneth Cobb (born 11 February 1950) is an Australian former politician who served as a National Party member of the Australian House of Representatives from November 2001 representing the Division of Parkes, and the Division of Calare from 2007 to 2016 when he retired.

==Early life and education==
Cobb was born in Bathurst, son of Lee and Mary Cobb, and was raised on the family property near Mount Hope, New South Wales.

==Career==

===Pre-political career===
From the 1980s until his candidacy for Federal Parliament, Cobb was active in, and spent three years as president of the New South Wales Farmers Association, a lobby group representing farmers and rural and regional communities. He also continued to farm the family property.

===Political career===
Cobb was elected to the House of Representatives from the Division of Parkes, a safe National Party seat, at the 2001 federal election.

In July 2005, Cobb was appointed to the ministry as Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, but soon after was reshuffled to the community services portfolio.

After Parkes was dramatically altered in a redistribution, Cobb ran for the neighbouring seat of Calare at the 2007 election after the popular independent member Peter Andren retired. The Liberal-National Party Coalition lost the election, but Cobb won Calare handily. He was chosen by new Opposition leader Brendan Nelson to be a member of the shadow ministry, as the spokesperson on regional development and water security.

<text>George Richard Moscone ( ; November 24, 1929 – November 27, 1978) was an American attorney and politician, who served as the 37th mayor of San Francisco from January 1976 until his assassination in November 1978. He was known as &quot;The People&#x27;s Mayor&quot;, who opened up City Hall and its commissions to reflect the diversity of San Francisco, appointing African Americans, Asian Americans, and gay people. A member of the Democratic Party, Moscone served in the California State Senate from 1967 until becoming mayor; in the Senate he served as majority leader. He is remembered for being an advocate of civil progressivism.

==Early life==
George Richard Moscone was born in the Italian-American enclave of San Francisco&#x27;s Marina District. The Moscone family comes from Piedmont and Liguria. His father was George Joseph Moscone, a corrections officer at nearby San Quentin, and his mother, Lena, was a homemaker who later went to work to support herself and her son after she separated from her husband.

Moscone attended St. Brigid&#x27;s and then St. Ignatius College Preparatory, where he was a noted debater and an all-city basketball star. He then attended College of the Pacific on a basketball scholarship and played basketball for the Tigers. He received a Bachelor of Arts in sociology in 1953.

Moscone then studied at University of California, Hastings College of the Law, where he received his law degree. He married Gina Bondanza, whom he had known since she was in grade school, in 1954. The Moscones would go on to have four children. After serving in the United States Navy, Moscone started private practice in 1956.

==Career==
As a young man playing basketball and as a young lawyer, Moscone became close friends with John Burton, who would later become a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. John&#x27;s older brother, Phillip, a member of the California State Assembly, recruited Moscone to run for an Assembly seat in 1960 as a Democrat. Though he lost that race, Moscone would go on to win a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1963. On the Board, Moscone was known for his defense of poor people, racial minorities and small business owners, as well as supporting the first successful fight in San Francisco to block construction of a proposed freeway that would have cut through Golden Gate Park and several neighborhoods.

===California State Senator===

In 1966 Moscone ran for and won a seat in the California State Senate, representing the 10th District in San Francisco County. Moscone was quickly rising through the ranks of the California Democratic Party and became closely associated with a loose alliance of progressive politicians in San Francisco led by the Burton brothers. This alliance was known as the Burton Machine and included John Burton, Phillip Burton, and Assemblyman Willie Brown. Soon after his election to the State Senate, Moscone was elected by his party to serve as Majority Leader. He was reelected to the 10th District seat in 1970 and to the newly redistricted 6th District seat, representing parts of San Francisco and San Mateo Counties, in 1974. He successfully sponsored legislation to institute a school lunch program for California students, as well as a bill legalizing abortion that was signed into law by Governor Ronald Reagan. In 1974 Moscone briefly considered a run for governor of California, but dropped out after a short time in favor of California Secretary of State Jerry Brown.

Moscone also was an early proponent of gay rights. In conjunction with his friend and ally in the Assembly, Willie Brown, Moscone managed to pass a bill repealing California&#x27;s sodomy law. The repeal was signed into law by California Governor Jerry Brown.

===Mayor of San Francisco===
On December 19, 1974, Moscone announced he would run for mayor of San Francisco in the 1975 race. In a close race in November 1975, Moscone placed first, with conservative city supervisor John Barbagelata second and supervisor Dianne Feinstein coming in third. Moscone and Barbagelata thus both advanced to the mandated runoff election in December where Moscone narrowly defeated the conservative supervisor by fewer than 5,000 votes. Liberals also won the city&#x27;s other top executive offices that year as Joseph Freitas was elected district attorney and Richard Hongisto was re-elected to his office of sheriff.

Moscone ran a grassroots mayoral campaign which drew volunteers from organizations like Glide Methodist Memorial Church, Delancey Street (a rehabilitation center for ex-convicts) and the Peoples Temple which was initially known as a church preaching racial equality and social justice but turned into a fanatical political cult. For the rest of his life, Barbagelata maintained that the Peoples Temple had committed massive election fraud on behalf of Moscone by busing people in from out of town to vote multiple times under the names of deceased San Francisco residents.

Moscone passed legislation reducing marijuana sentences, granting abortion rights, establishing a school meals program and overturning the state&#x27;s anti-sodomy laws.

The Peoples Temple also worked to get out the vote in precincts where Moscone received a 12-to-1 vote margin over Barbagelata. After the Peoples Temple&#x27;s work and votes by Temple members were instrumental in delivering a close victory for Moscone, Moscone appointed Temple leader Jim Jones as chairman of the San Francisco Housing Commission.

Moscone&#x27;s first year as mayor was spent preventing the San Francisco Giants professional baseball team from moving to Toronto and advocating a citywide ballot initiative in favor of district election to the board of supervisors. Moscone was the first mayor to appoint large numbers of women, homosexuals and racial minorities to city commissions and advisory boards. In 1977, he appointed Del Martin, the first lesbian woman, and Kathleen Hardiman Arnold, now Kathleen Rand Reed, the first Black woman, as commissioners on the San Francisco Commission on the Status of Women (SFCOSW). Moscone also appointed liberal Oakland Police Chief Charles Gain to head the San Francisco Police Department. Gain (and by extension Moscone) became highly unpopular among rank and file San Francisco police officers for proposing a settlement to a lawsuit brought by minorities claiming discriminatory recruiting practices by the police force.

In April 1977, Moscone stood up to officials in Washington by supporting a 25-day occupation of San Francisco&#x27;s federal building by a group of over 100 people with disabilities demanding their civil rights in what would become known as the 504 Sit-in. While federal officials hoped to starve out the protesters, the mayor visited them and arranged to have portable showers and towels brought in. Thanks in part to Moscone&#x27;s support, the occupation was successful, and helped pave the way for passing the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) thirteen years later.

In 1977 Moscone, Freitas and Hongisto all easily survived a recall election pushed by defeated Moscone opponent John Barbagelata along with business interests. It was a political vindication for Moscone, who won in a landslide. Barbagelata announced he was retiring from politics. That year also marked the passage of the district election system by San Francisco voters. The city&#x27;s first district elections for board of supervisors took place in November 1977. Among those elected were the city&#x27;s first openly gay supervisor, Harvey Milk, single mother and attorney Carol Ruth Silver, Chinese-American Gordon Lau, and fireman and police officer Dan White. Milk, Silver and Lau along with John Molinari and Robert Gonzales made up Moscone&#x27;s allies on the board, while White, Dianne Feinstein, Quentin Kopp, Ella Hill Hutch, Lee Dolson, and Ron Pelosi formed a loosely organized coalition to oppose Moscone and his initiatives. Feinstein was elected president of the board of supervisors on a 6–5 vote, with Moscone&#x27;s supporters backing Lau. It was generally believed that Feinstein, having twice lost election to the office of mayor, would support Kopp against Moscone in the 1979 election and retire rather than run for the board again.

====Refusal to investigate Peoples Temple====

In August 1977, after Peoples Temple leader Jim Jones fled to Jonestown following media scrutiny alleging criminal wrongdoing, Moscone announced that his office would not investigate Jones or Peoples Temple. The later mass murder-suicide at Jonestown dominated national headlines at the time of Moscone&#x27;s death.

After the massacre, Temple members revealed to &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the Temple had arranged for &quot;busloads&quot; of members to be bused in from Redwood Valley to San Francisco to vote in the 1975 election. A former Temple member stated that many of those members were not registered to vote in San Francisco, while another former member said &quot;Jones swayed elections.&quot; Prior to leaving San Francisco, Jones claimed to have bribed Moscone with sexual favors from female Temple members, including one who was underage; his son, Jim Jones, Jr., later remembered how Moscone frequented Temple parties &quot;with a cocktail in his hand and doing some ass grabbing&quot;.

==Assassination==

Late in 1978, Dan White resigned from the board of supervisors. His resignation would allow Moscone to choose White&#x27;s successor, which could tip the board&#x27;s balance of power in Moscone&#x27;s favor. Recognizing this, those who supported a more conservative agenda and opposed integration of the police and fire departments talked White into changing his mind. White then requested that Moscone re-appoint him to his former seat.

Moscone originally indicated a willingness to reconsider, but more liberal city leaders, including supervisor Harvey Milk, lobbied him against the idea. Moscone ultimately decided not to appoint White. On November 27, 1978, three days after Moscone&#x27;s 49th birthday, White went to San Francisco City Hall to meet with Moscone and purportedly to make a final plea for appointment. White sneaked into City Hall through a basement window to avoid the metal detector at the main door. He carried his old police revolver. When Moscone agreed to talk with him in a private room, White pulled the gun out of his suit jacket and shot and killed Moscone. White then re-loaded his gun and walked across City Hall to Milk&#x27;s office, where White shot and killed Milk as well.

Dianne Feinstein, president of the board of supervisors, was sworn in as the city&#x27;s new mayor and in the following years would emerge as one of California&#x27;s most prominent politicians.

Six thousand mourners attended a service for Moscone at St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral.

White later turned himself in at the police station where he was formerly an officer. The term &quot;Twinkie defense&quot; has its origins in the murder trial that followed. White was convicted of the lesser crime of manslaughter, due in part to his claim of severe depression, which White&#x27;s attorneys argued was evidenced by his consumption of Twinkies and other junk foods. Outrage over White&#x27;s lenient sentence provoked a mass riot in San Francisco, during which police cars were set on fire by angry protestors. White was released from prison and then shortly afterward committed suicide in 1985.

Vigils are held annually to commemorate the assassinations of Moscone and Milk.

==Legacy==

Moscone is interred at Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California alongside his mother Lena.
Moscone Center, San Francisco&#x27;s largest convention center and exhibition hall, is named in his honor. Moscone and Milk also have schools named after them: George Moscone Elementary, Harvey Milk Elementary and Harvey Milk High School.

Moscone&#x27;s main political legacy is his opening up San Francisco City Hall to be a more diverse and inclusive place with political appointments that represented the full spectrum of the population, including minorities and the growing gay community. Despite a backlash from the political old guard and conservatives, and despite the double assassination of Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk, both leading progressives, the city never retreated from Moscone&#x27;s more inclusive view of politics.
In 1980, sculptor Robert Arneson was commissioned to create a monument to Moscone to be installed in the new Moscone Convention Center. The bust portraying Moscone was done in Arneson&#x27;s California Funk style and was accepted by San Francisco&#x27;s Art Commission. Arneson included as part of the sculpture on the pedestal the likeness of a pistol, and references to Harvey Milk, the assassinations, the &quot;Twinkie Defense&quot;, the White Night riots, and Dianne Feinstein&#x27;s mayoral succession. Arneson refused to make alterations to the work, the commission was returned to him, and it was later resold to the SF Museum of Modern Art. In a critique of the event, Frederic Stout wrote that &quot;Arneson&#x27;s mistake was in presenting the city mothers/fathers with something honest, engaging and provoking, that is to say, a work of art. What they wanted, of course, was not a work of art at all. They wanted an object of ritual magic: the smiling head of a dead politician.&quot; In 1994, a new bust by San Francisco artist Spero Anargyros was unveiled, depicting Moscone holding a pen, below which are words from Moscone: &quot;San Francisco is an extraordinary city, because its people have learned to live together with one another, to respect each other, and to work with each other for the future of their community. That&#x27;s the strength and beauty of this city – it&#x27;s the reason why the citizens who live here are the luckiest people in the world.&quot;

Moscone was portrayed by Victor Garber in Gus Van Sant&#x27;s Harvey Milk biopic, &quot;Milk&quot;. Their murders were also the subject of the Dead Kennedys&#x27; version of the Sonny Curtis song &quot;I Fought the Law&quot;. Moscone&#x27;s son Jonathan, aged 14 at the time of his father&#x27;s murder, later co-wrote the play &quot;Ghost Light&quot; with Tony Taccone about the effects the assassination had on him. It premiered at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 2011. A public television documentary about Moscone&#x27;s political career, &quot;Moscone: A Legacy of Change&quot;, debuted in November 2018, the 40th anniversary of Moscone&#x27;s death. Produced by Nat Katzman, written by Stephen Talbot and narrated by Peter Coyote.

<text>The Orange Line is one of the six rapid transit lines of the Washington Metro system, consisting of 26 stations in Fairfax County and Arlington in Northern Virginia; Washington, D.C.; and Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States. The Orange Line runs from Vienna in Virginia to New Carrollton in Maryland. Half of the line&#x27;s stations are shared with the Blue Line and over two-thirds are shared with the Silver Line. Orange Line service began on November 20, 1978.

Trains run every 10 minutes during weekday rush hours, every 12 minutes during weekday off-peak hours and weekends, and every 15 minutes daily after 9:30pm.

== History ==
===20th century===
In 1955, planning for Metro began with the Mass Transportation Survey, which attempted to forecast both freeway and mass transit systems sufficient to meet the needs of transportation in 1980. In 1959, the study&#x27;s final report included two rapid transit lines which anticipated subways in downtown Washington. Because the plan called for extensive freeway construction within Washington, D.C., alarmed residents lobbied for federal legislation creating a moratorium on freeway construction through July 1, 1962. The National Capital Transportation Agency&#x27;s 1962 &quot;Transportation in the National Capital Region&quot; report anticipated much of the present Orange Line route in Virginia with the route following the median strip of Interstate 66 both inside Arlington and beyond. The route continued in rapid transit plans until the formation of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA).

With the formation of WMATA in October 1966, planning of the system shifted from federal hands to a regional body with representatives of the District, Maryland and Virginia. Congressional route approval was no longer a key consideration. Instead, routes had to serve each local suburban jurisdiction to assure that they would approve bond referendums to finance the system. Because the least expensive way to build into the suburbs was to rely upon existing railroad right-of-ways, the Orange Line took much of its present form, except that it also featured a further extension along the railroad to Bowie, Maryland and along the Dulles Access Road to Dulles International Airport.

By 1966, WMATA and Arlington County planners had agreed &quot;to realign the rapid transit through high-density commercial-office-apartment areas in the vicinity of Wilson Boulevard instead of the freeway&#x27;s median between the river and Glebe Road.&quot; As a result of this agreement, the Orange Line follows in Arlington the former routes of an interurban electric trolley line, the Fairfax line and the North Arlington branch of the Washington, Arlington &amp; Falls Church Railway, that had initially spurred those areas&#x27; development.

In March 1968, WMATA approved its Adopted Regional System (ARS) plan that included suburban mass transit lines that followed the median of the proposed Interstate 66 through Virginia to Vienna and the CSX/Amtrak railroad right-of-way in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland. The construction of the downtown Washington sections of the Orange and Blue lines began simultaneously with the Red line. A joint ground-breaking ceremony was held on December 9, 1969. Service on the joint downtown track was at first branded as just the Blue Line and commenced on July 1, 1977.

In 1976, Robert Patricelli, federal Urban Mass Transportation Administrator, ordered Metro to conduct an alternatives analysis of the portion of its system that was not already under contract. Because the Tysons area of Fairfax County developed significantly since the ARS was adopted in 1968, the analysis considered rerouting the Orange line to serve Tysons Corner at an additional cost of $60 million. However, because environmental impact statements had already been completed for the Vienna route, a change in the route would result in a five-year delay in the construction of the Orange Line west of Ballston. This prompted the City of Falls Church to sue WMATA for breach of contract. In the end, WMATA kept the Vienna route intact, leaving Tysons without Metrorail service until 2014.

Service on the Orange Line began on November 20, 1978 between National Airport and New Carrollton, with five new stations being added to the existing network from Stadium–Armory. When the line from Rosslyn to Ballston-MU was completed on December 11, 1979, Orange Line trains began following this route rather than going to the National Airport station. The line was completed on June 7, 1986, when it was extended by four stations to Vienna in the I-66 median.

On January 13, 1982, an Orange Line train derailed as it was being backed up from an improperly closed rail switch between the Federal Triangle and Smithsonian stations, resulting in the deaths of three passengers. It was the first incident within the Metro system that caused a fatality, and the deadliest incident occurring in the system until the 2009 collision that resulted in nine fatalities.

===21st century===
Between 2011 and 2013, service was interrupted at stations west of Ballston–MU on designated weekends to accommodate the construction of the interconnection of the Silver Line with the existing Orange Line tracks. As a part of this project, the train yard adjacent to the West Falls Church station on the Orange Line was expanded.

On July 26, 2014, Orange Line stations between East Falls Church and Stadium-Armory began to serve Silver Line trains.

From March 26, 2020 until June 28, 2020, trains were bypassing , , , , , , and stations due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. All stations reopened on June 28, 2020, except for East Falls Church until August 23 due to the platform reconstruction project west of Ballston-MU.

From May 23 until August 15, 2020, trains terminated at Ballston–MU due to platform reconstruction at , , , and . The original plan called for trains to terminate at West Falls Church, but this was instead changed to Ballston due to effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and low ridership. Shuttle buses were provided to the closed stations. On August 16, 2020, all Orange line trains began terminating at while bypassing . East Falls Church reopened on August 23, 2020. On September 8, 2020, Vienna and Dunn Loring stations reopened.

Between May 28 and September 5, 2022, all Orange Line trains were terminating at station on weekdays and Ballston–MU station on weekends due to the Platform Improvement Project which closed stations east of Stadium–Armory. Shuttle buses are provided to all closed stations.

On June 3, 2023, service was suspended west of Ballston–MU for track replacement. and reopened on June 26, 2023. and reopened on July 17, 2023.
== Route ==

Starting at its western terminus at the Vienna/Fairfax-GMU station in Virginia, the tracks run on the median strip of Interstate 66 meeting up with the Silver Line immediately after West Falls Church until they enter a tunnel under Fairfax Drive just before Ballston–MU. The tunnel shifts to Wilson Blvd and 16th Street North. The tunnel then turns north and merges with the Blue Line just before entering Rosslyn which is located under North Lynn Street. The tunnel continues under the Potomac River and bends to the east to travel under I Street NW in the District of Columbia towards Foggy Bottom–GWU.
The tunnel continues east under the Potomac River and then I Street. Between Farragut West and McPherson Square stations, there is a non-revenue branch track on the westbound track that connects to the Northwest bound track before Farragut North on the Red Line. The tunnel then turns south under 12th Street Northwest and enters the lower level of the Metro Center station underneath the Red Line. After the Federal Triangle and Smithsonian stations, the tunnel turns east under D Street Southwest and then southeast under Pennsylvania Avenue Southeast before reaching L’Enfant Plaza underneath the Green and Yellow Lines. Continuing east towards the Potomac Avenue station, the tunnel briefly travels under G Street Southeast and then turns northwest under Potomac Avenue with a turn to the north to travel under 19th Street Southeast for the Stadium-Armory station. The tunnel then travels under the RFK Stadium parking lots to surface near Benning Road. The elevated tracks follow Benning Road across the Anacostia River and then would go on to part ways with the Blue and Silver Lines.

After splitting with the Blue and Silver lines (which descend back underground towards Benning Road), the above ground tracks continue for the Orange Line only along DC Route 295 between Minnesota Avenue and Deanwood stations and then follow the CSX/Amtrak/MARC railroad in Prince George’s County to serve Cheverly along with Landover before reaching the eastern terminus at New Carrollton. 

The route includes storage yards adjacent to West Falls Church and just beyond New Carrollton. Orange Line service travels along the entirety of the K Route (from the terminus at Vienna/Fairfax-GMU to the C &amp; K junction just south of Rosslyn), part of the C Route (from the C &amp; K junction just south of Rosslyn to Metro Center), and the entire D Route (from Metro Center to New Carrollton).

The Orange Line needs 30 trains (9 eight-car trains and 21 six-car trains, consisting of 198 rail cars) to run at peak capacity.

== Stations ==
The following stations are along the line, from west to east:


== Future ==
The Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) announced on January 18, 2008 that it and the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation (VDPRT) had begun work on a draft environmental impact statement (EIS) for the I-66 corridor in Fairfax and Prince William counties. According to VDOT the EIS, officially named the I-66 Multimodal Transportation and Environment Study, would focus on improving mobility along I-66 from the Capital Beltway (I-495) interchange in Fairfax County to the interchange with U.S. Route 15 in Prince William County. The EIS also allegedly includes a four station extension of the Orange Line past Vienna. The extension would continue to run in the I-66 median and would have stations at Chain Bridge Road, Fair Oaks, Stringfellow Road and Centreville near Virginia Route 28 and U.S. Route 29. Also, plans to extend Orange Line to Bowie have been proposed. In its final report published June 8, 2012, the study and analysis revealed that an &quot;extension would have a minimal impact on Metrorail ridership and volumes on study area roadways inside the Beltway and would therefore not relieve congestion in the study corridor.&quot;

<doc id="559400" wikidata="Q1751032" url="?curid=559400" title="Plum Creek Timber">
<text>Plum Creek Timber Company, Inc. was a timberland owner and manager, as well as a forest products, mineral extraction, and property development company, until it merged with Weyerhaeuser Company. It was headquartered in Suite 3100 at 601 Union Street in Seattle.

Plum Creek was spun off from Burlington Resources as a master limited partnership (MLP) on June 8, 1989. Burlington Resources was created from the Burlington Northern railroad&#x27;s natural resources holdings in 1988. Plum Creek Timber is heir to some of the of timberland originally granted by the federal government to the Northern Pacific Railway in the 1860s, and most of Burlington&#x27;s lands were originally purchased, or otherwise acquired as timberland. The MLP converted to a real estate investment trust on July 1, 1999, in order to obtain tax and accounting advantages available to real estate developers. In 2000, Plum Creek Timber acquired the timberland division of Georgia-Pacific.

Plum Creek Timber produces a line of softwood lumber products, including common and select boards, studs, edge-glued boards, and finger-jointed studs. These products are targeted to domestic lumber retailers, such as retail home centers, for use in repair and remodeling projects. These products are also sold to stocking distributors for use in home construction. The company also does mineral extraction, natural gas production, and deals with communication and transportation rights of way. As of December 31, 2014, the company owned and managed approximately of timber lands in 19 states, as well as owned and operated five wood product conversion facilities in the northwest U.S.

On November 8, 2015, it was announced that Plum Creek would be bought by Seattle-based Weyerhaeuser for $8.4 billion, forming the largest private owner of timberland in the United States. The transaction closed on February 19, 2016.

==Transactions with the U.S. Federal Government==

In late 1999, Congress approved a land swap involving more than of forest land in the Cascade Mountains. In the deal, Plum Creek gave up of land, much of it along Interstate 90 east of Seattle, in exchange for in Federal lands. Plum Creek had warned the U.S. Government that it would log the land should the deal not go through. The federal government also had to pay $4.3 million as part of the deal.

In 2008, Senator Max Baucus arranged for appropriations in the 2008 Farm Bill to be used to purchase of Plum Creek land in Montana. This project became known as the Montana Legacy Project.

==Environmental record==
There is some controversy over the management of Plum Creek&#x27;s timberland, mostly from environmental groups who decry the recent move from Plum Creek as a timber management company into a developer of its land, taking advantage of the much more profitable land values that have occurred for undeveloped land in the late 1990s until the crash in real estate prices. Plum Creek is engaged in a proposal for a large resort and development tract in the Northern Maine Woods, on Moosehead Lake by Greenville, Maine, one of the largest undeveloped forests east of the Mississippi River.

This follows on the heels of their development of managed land in Washington state (Suncadia) and Montana (Moonlight Basin, Yellowstone Club) into costly resorts, bringing golf courses and luxury housing into the deep forests. The debate pits conservation groups trying to balance recreation and protection, and the effects of sprawl and overdevelopment upon wildlife, quality of life, and the employment of local populations who depend in part on the hunting, fishing and tourist trades which may be damaged by the overdevelopment of the area.

Plum Creek stated that they follow three principles, Replanting, Protecting Water Quality, and Managing Wildlife Habitat. Every year, Plum Creek replanted approximately 85 million seedlings and plans for the natural regeneration of millions of trees. Close to of land owned by Plum Creek are a part of four habitat conservation plans across the country and in Montana are involved in a conservation agreement for the grizzly bear.

In 2001, Plum Creek at their Medium Density Fiberboard facility completed the installation of a biofilter, a new air emission treatment technology. This technology uses naturally occurring bacteria to destroy air pollutants that are generated in the wood fiber drying and pressing processes. The technology does not burn natural gas like most treatment systems do to destroy pollutants.

They are also currently working on a Plum Creek Moosehead development. According to an environmental group, the Native Forest Network (NFN), if approved by the Land Use Regulation Commission, Plum Creek&#x27;s plan would increase Maine&#x27;s total carbon emissions by nearly 8%.

<text>Ann Kathleen Corcoran (born 21 September 1951) is a former Australian politician. She was a member of the House of Representatives from 2000 to 2007, representing the Victorian seat of Isaacs for the Australian Labor Party (ALP). She was an accountant prior to entering politics.

==Early life==
Corcoran was born on 21 September 1951 in Dandenong, Victoria. Her father Robert Corcoran, a published author, was a prominent figure in the ALP split of 1955, giving evidence to the Federal Executive in favour of federal leader H.V. Evatt.

Corcoran is a member of CPA Australia and holds a diploma in business studies from Swinburne College of Technology and a graduate diploma in business from Monash University. Prior to entering parliament she held managerial positions in accounting as finance, including deputy manager of general accounting at the University of Melbourne (1988–1992), management accountant at Frankston Hospital (1992–1995), deputy director of finance at Royal Melbourne Hospital (1995–1996), business manager at Kilvington Grammar School (1996–1999), and business manager at Woodleigh School, Melbourne (1999).

==Politics==
Corcoran was elected to parliament at the 2000 Isaacs by-election, caused by the death by suicide of the incumbent Labor MP Greg Wilton. She was re-elected at the 2001 and 2004 federal elections.

In parliament, Corcoran served two terms on the speaker&#x27;s panel and was a member of several parliamentary committees. She was a shadow parliamentary secretary from 2004 to 2006 under opposition leaders of Mark Latham and Kim Beazley, assisting the shadow ministers for health and immigration. She reportedly voted for Latham against Beazley in the December 2003 leadership election.

In March 2006, Corcoran was successfully challenged for preselection by Mark Dreyfus. Her term ended prior to the 2007 federal election.

==Later life==
Corcoran became interim student ombudsman at Monash University in November 2007 and was appointed to the permanent position by the university council in early 2009.

<text>Ardsley-on-Hudson station is a commuter rail stop on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line, located in the Ardsley Park area of Irvington, New York. It serves both the neighborhood and the northern part of the village of Dobbs Ferry; the main campus of Mercy College is within walking distance of the station.

As of August 2006, daily commuter ridership was 420 and there were 134 parking spots.

==History==
The station was originally part of the Ardsley Casino Clubhouse, a country club created through the support of some of the most notable and successful men in the US including Jay Gould, Cornelius Vanderbilt (New York Central entrepreneur) and John Pierpont Morgan. The Casino was built overlooking the Hudson River and besides the station, had a private dock to accommodate the yachts of members. The Ardsley Racquet and Swim Club, an offshoot established in 1927, inherited the property in 1935, and the casino was closed in 1936. The site was replaced by the Hudson House Apartments. Even with all the changes, the original mid-1890s New York Central Railroad depot remained intact. As with many stations along the Hudson Division, the New York Central merged with the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968 to form Penn Central Railroad. The 1970 bankruptcy of Penn Central forced it to turn service over to the MTA, which continued through the time it was taken over by Conrail in 1976, and then by Metro-North Railroad in 1983. While there is no official station house, Metro-North does maintain a small two-story brick depot, housing the northbound waiting room, ticket machines, and the United States Post Office for ZIP Code 10503.

The crossover ramp to southbound or New York City-bound trains was inside the depot until 2006, when Metro-North razed the ramp and built one a few steps to the south, with a higher clearance for projected double-deck trains. At that time new, longer platforms were installed on both sides of the tracks. On February 1, 2010, a sanitation truck smashed into the historic pedestrian bridge leading from the station house to the Hudson House Apartments. The bridge was never rebuilt.

In December 2017, the Village Board of Irvington, which has jurisdiction over the station, passed local legislation which expanded the types of business which would be allowed to be situated in the station&#x27;s building, while still prohibiting fast-food restaurants, drive-through type businesses and businesses which produced &quot;odor, dust, noise, smoke, gas, fumes or radiation&quot;.

==Station layout==
The station has two slightly offset high-level side platforms each eight cars long. Only one of the express tracks, specifically Track 2 is powered by third rail.

==In popular culture==
The station was used as a location for the 2002 film &quot;Unfaithful&quot;, starring Richard Gere and Diane Lane. It also figured in the setting of the 1984 film &quot;Falling in Love&quot;. Emily Blunt&#x27;s character Rachel takes the train out of Ardsley-on-Hudson in the 2016 film &quot;The Girl on the Train&quot;.

<text>Hastings-on-Hudson station is a commuter rail stop on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line, located in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.

==History==
Hastings-on-Hudson has had railroad service from as far back as the 1840s, pre-dating the Hudson River Railroad, and served both passengers and a local sugar refinery. In 1875, a major fire destroyed the waterfront, and the company running the sugar refinery left town, but other industries ended up taking its place.

The current Hastings-on-Hudson station building was built in 1910 by the New York Central Railroad. As with many NYCRR stations in Westchester County, the station became a Penn Central station upon the merger between NYC and Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968, until it was taken over by Conrail in 1976, and then by Metro-North Railroad in 1983.

==Station layout==
The station has two slightly offset high-level side platforms each eight cars long. The inner tracks not next to either platform are used by express trains, only one of the express tracks is powered.

<text>Pinoy hip hop or Filipino hip-hop (also known as Pinoy rap) is a style of hip hop music performed by musicians of Filipino descent, especially Filipino-Americans.

The Philippines is known for having the first hip hop music scene in Asia since the early 1980s, largely due to the country&#x27;s historical connections with the United States where hip hop originated. Rap music released in the Philippines has appeared in different languages or dialects such as Tagalog, Bicolano, Chavacano, Cebuano, Ilocano and English. In the Philippines, Andrew E., Francis Magalona and Gloc-9 are considered among the most influential rappers in the country, being the first to release mainstream rap albums. Apl.de.ap of the Black Eyed Peas, Cassie Ventura, Chad Hugo of the Neptunes, N.E.R.D. and Ez Mil are among the contemporary Filipino-American hip-hop artists.

==History==
===Origins===
The towns surrounding the numerous American military bases in the Philippines, such as Clark Air Base in Angeles City and Subic Bay Naval Base in Olongapo, were among the earliest to be exposed to the culture. Contact with African-American, Filipino-American and Latino servicemen resulted in some of the earliest exposure the locals had to the new musical genre.

===1980s: Seeds of a movement===
In 1980, the earliest rap recording came from Dyords Javier&#x27;s single &quot;Na Onseng Delight&quot;, a parody of &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot; by the Sugarhill Gang, released under Wea Records. It is considered the first known rap track out of Asia, making the Philippines the first to dabble in hip-hop in the region. That same year, pioneer Vincent Dafalong released the singles, &quot;Ispraken-Delight&quot; and &quot;Mahiwagang Nunal&quot;.

Influential hip hop films such as &quot;Wild Style&quot; (1982), &quot;Breakin&#x27;&quot; (1984) and &quot;Krush Groove&quot; (1985) were influences. In 1982, local breakdancing crews like the Angeles City-based Whooze Co. International, with members consisting primarily from Clark Air Base, The Eclipse (whose former members included Francis Magalona, &quot;Dance 10&quot; 1983 champion Darwin Tuason and current Federation Sounds&#x27; Glenn &quot;Kico&quot; Lelay), Info-Clash Breakers and Ground Control (whose members included Rap Master Fordy, later to be known as Andrew E.), and Jay &quot;Smooth&quot; MC of Bass Rhyme Posse became popular in local parks and malls in and around the Metro Manila area such as the Glorietta mall, which was an early hotspot for breakers. Several mobile DJ crews of the era included such names as the Rock All Parties Crew which emerged onto the scene only to produce future Pinoy rap pioneers such as Andrew E. and Norman B.

===1990s: Old School hip hop===

The genre soon entered the mainstream with Francis Magalona&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Yo!&quot; (1990), which included the nationalistic hit &quot;Mga Kababayan&quot; (&quot;My Countrymen&quot;), which brought Magalona to prominence.

More artists followed in Magalona&#x27;s footsteps. The list includes Andrew E. who released his first single, &quot;Humanap Ka ng Pangit&quot; (&quot;Look for Someone Ugly&quot;) in 1990 and Michael V. with the release of his first song &quot;Maganda ang Piliin&quot; (&quot;Pick Someone Pretty&quot;) in 1991, a companion piece to Andrew E.&#x27;s &quot;Humanap Ka ng Pangit&quot;.

Known as the &quot;golden age&quot; of Pinoy hip hop, the 1990s marked the beginning of many rapid stylistic innovations beginning in 1991 with the establishment of the Disco Mix Club Philippines which was one of the earliest platforms for Philippine DJ mixing battles. Early innovators of the style included DJs Carlo Yalo, Noel Macanaya, Rod &quot;DVS&quot; Torres and Omar Lacap, among others.

Following the path set forth by their Bass Rhyme predecessors, the tri-lingual rap group Rapasia released their self-titled debut record in 1991, garnering the hit &quot;Hoy! Tsismosa&quot;. One of the earliest Filipino hip hop groups to embrace such an abstract format, the album&#x27;s lyrical content often contained a mixture of various Philippine languages (including Tagalog and Chavacano) along with English. 

The pioneering Pinoy hip hop act Bass Rhyme Posse released their self-titled debut album on VIVA Records in 1991, which spawned the cult hits &quot;Let the Beat Flow&quot;, &quot;Buhay Estudyante&quot; (&quot;Student Life&quot;) and &quot;Juan T.&quot;, becoming the genre&#x27;s first rap group to release a record.

1992 marked a turning point for Pinoy rap with the release of Francis M&#x27;s influential second album, &quot;Rap Is Francis M&quot;, which is regarded as one of the greatest Pinoy rap albums ever. Ushering in a socially awoken wave not seen in the Philippine music industry since the heyday of Juan De La Cruz, Sampaguita and 1970s Pinoy rock, Magalona&#x27;s tracks dissected the various cultural, social and political problems that plagued his country such as drug addiction in &quot;Mga Praning&quot; (&quot;The Addicts&quot;), political corruption and instability in &quot;Halalan&quot; (&quot;Election&quot;) as well as the detrimental effects of a colonial mentality to Filipino culture in &quot;Tayo&#x27;y Mga Pinoy&quot; (&quot;We Are Filipinos&quot;). The record&#x27;s complexity and socially sentient message quickly earned it its classic status and became the standard by which future albums of the genre were to be compared to. Magalona&#x27;s enduring contributions to the genre was recognized in the &quot;All Music Guide to Hip-Hop: The Definitive Guide to Rap and Hip-Hop&quot; (2003) published by Backbeat Books; as well as in the U.S.-based hip hop publication &quot;The Source&quot; (May 2004).

In 1994, going against the wave of radio-friendly rap tracks that dominated at the time, the group Death Threat, founded by rappers Beware and Genezide, released the first Filipino gangsta rap album which told tales of the daily lives and struggles impoverished Filipino youth faced growing up in the slums of Metro Manila titled &quot;Gusto Kong Bumaet&quot; (&quot;I Want to Be Good&quot;).

In 1997, the underground Pinoy rap group Pamilia Dimagiba released their album &quot;Broke-N-Unsigned&quot; on Tenement Records, marking the re-emergence of the conscious emcee in Pinoy rap. A coalition of sorts, Pamilia Dimagiba composed itself of several underground Pinoy rappers and crews such as 8th Messenger, Shadowblyde, Spoon, Murder-1 of Khan&#x27;s Assassins, and Young Galaxy of Iron Triangle, among others. The raw seven-track, politically minded album was a breath of fresh air at the time, as Pinoy rap during the era had taken a more hardcore, gangster persona. Known for their coarse lyrics, serious subject matter complemented by heavy beats fused within traditional Filipino folk music, the camp&#x27;s records &quot;Duelo&quot;, &quot;Manila&#x27;s Finest&quot;, &quot;Reality Hurtz&quot; and &quot;Brainstorming&quot; among others were largely in essence a throwback to the early, nationalistic Francis M inspired days of the genre.

The same year, the very first Filipino Rap record label Dongalo Wreckords was established.

The widespread popularity of Pinoy rap in and around the islands has resulted in the spawning of a new breed of Pinoy emcees: junior &quot;rapistas&quot;. Far from being a new trend, Jaymie &quot;Baby&quot; Magtoto and her 1991 hit single &quot;Eh! Kasi Bata&quot; (&quot;Cause I&#x27;m a Kid&quot;) was an early example of Pinoy kiddie rappers. The single was also included in the soundtrack for Magtoto&#x27;s motion picture debut of the same name released later that year.

The 2000s saw the resurgence of grade school rappers in Filipino hip hop. In 2001, Rap Group Salbakuta (under Dongalo Wreckords) became a phenomenal through its first single, Stupid Luv and was later adapted to a movie. 2005 was a breakthrough for kid rappers in the Philippines as Aikee, through the Madd World/Circulo Pugantes Camp released his debut &quot;Ang Bawat Bata&quot; (&quot;Every Child&quot;) on Alpha Music and at eleven years of age, became the youngest Filipino rapper to release a full rap album.

===2000s: The rise of Philippine hip hop scene===

In the new millennium, Filipino hip-hop rivalled Pinoy rock&#x27;s traditional popularity amongst Filipino youth. 

Since 2004, the Philippine Hip-Hop Music Awards has been held annually in Metro Manila. The show is reminiscent of The Source Awards in the US. Gloc-9, considered to be the fastest rapper in the Philippines and former member of the rap group Death Threat, held the title for Best Rap Artist at the awards show for four consecutive years, from 2005 to 2008, achieving mainstream popularity and releasing successful commercial albums every other year. Like the American hip hop industry, music videos have become an important trend (even containing small cameos from different Filipino rappers) and air on TV channels like MTV Philippines and MYX. Despite Metro Manila&#x27;s powerful position over the music industry, rap groups in the south have started to gain their own share of popularity, like Dice &amp; K9 a.k.a. Mobbstarr from Cebu City with their first hit single &quot;Itsumo&quot; in 2003, Thavawenyoz from Davao City with their debut album &quot;Hubag&quot; in 2005, and Zambo Top Dogz from Zamboanga City, known for their Chavacano rapping in the songs &quot;Noticias&quot; and &quot;Conversa Ta&quot;. It is also not uncommon for Filipino-American artists to perform live, sell records, and win awards in the Philippines while living in the States, for example Pikaso from San Francisco, California who won the Producer of the Year award in 2008.

The popularity of artists such as Dice &amp; K9 a.k.a. Mobbstarr (known for their popular Japanese and English combination hit song &quot;Itsumo&quot;), Pikaso, Audible, and Krook and J.O.L.O., who primarily use English lyrics in their tracks, has given way to the ongoing divide between Tagalog lyricists and English lyricists. With English tracks dominating the airwaves, several Tagalog-based emcees felt a sort of bias in the Philippine music industry, which favors artists who use English rather than Filipino. The conflict over language became evident in the 2004 Black Eyed Peas concert in Manila in which rapper Mike Swift&#x27;s Tagalog-based track was cut short halfway through the song due to the &quot;English Only&quot; policy enforced by the event&#x27;s organizers towards Black Eyed Peas&#x27; opening acts.

In 2006, the group Stick Figgas, runners-up in Francis M&#x27;s &quot;Rappublic of the Philippines&quot; talent search, released their debut album &quot;Critical Condition&quot; under joint-release with Dice &amp; K9&#x27;s &quot;6000 Goonz&quot; imprint and Francis M&#x27;s Red Egg Records sub-label, which, amidst critical acclaim, sparked a resurgence and renaissance of sorts in Tagalog rap. The Stick Figgas relied on clever punchlines, creative lyricism and intricate rhyme schemes, re-introducing a technical poignancy that has been absent in Tagalog rap since B.B. Clan&#x27;s first album &quot;Mabanges&quot;. This rap style has arguably inspired the current generation of Tagalog rappers to place much more emphasis on multi-syllable rhyme schemes, punchlines and metaphors than before.

===2010s: FlipTop battle league, trap genre emergence and second golden age===

The influence of the original rap battle leagues in the West – Grind Time Now (U.S.), King of the Dot (Canada) and Don&#x27;t Flop (UK) – all founded in 2008, inspired the creation of other battle leagues around the world, FlipTop being one of them, in 2010. This local rap battle competition typically involves both parties (either 2 rappers or 2 duos) hailing mudslinging words and rhymes at each other, who are then judged at the end based on a number of factors including flow and use of insults/punchlines and audience impact. The one with the most votes from the judges is declared winner. FlipTop gained millions of views online, as it reminded viewers of the Balagtasan format, a type of debate done through verse named after the father of Filipino poetry Francisco Balagtas. FlipTop also launched the careers of several rappers including Abra, Bassilyo, Loonie, and Zaito. 

===2020s: The expansion of Pinoy hip hop scene===
In late 2019, MCA Music (now UMG/UMUSIC Philippines) launched Def Jam Philippines, a new label dedicated to established and up-and-coming hip hop and R&amp;B acts. In 2021, 8 Ballin&#x27;, a hip hop collective group from Rizal, took the Pinoy hip hop spotlight after the music video of their controversial hit single &quot;Know Me&quot; became viral on YouTube and has been became the talk of the town on social media because of memes and their mumble rapping, and caught the attention of Def Jam Philippines which led the collective group to join the label. Other hiphop artists Def Jam have signed include JMara, Fateeha, VVS Collective, and Karencitta.

The 2020s also gave the rise of Filipino-American rapper Ez Mil. He gained fame in 2021 after his performance of his song &quot;Panalo (Trap Cariñosa)&quot; on the Wish Bus USA went viral, amassing millions of views in just a few days after premiering on YouTube on January 29. In 2023, Ez Mil was signed to labels owned by Eminem and Dr. Dre. Other Filipino-American rappers of the 2020s include Ruby Ibarra, Klassy, Rocky Rivera, and Guapdad 4000.

The 2020s also saw a change in hiphop, as rap began containing elements of harana music. Leading this change was Hev Abi, a rapper from Quezon City who topped the Spotify charts. Other Filipino rappers who gained prominence during this decade include Lo Ki, Flow G, and O Side Mafia. 

==Other elements of hip hop==

The art of MCing or rapping in Filipino hip hop is also represented in other forms such as battle rapping or freestyling. Several annual contests such as the Fête de la Musique, the Blazin&#x27; Freestyle Battle and PR&#x27;s Rap Mania are held annually within the Philippines specifically aimed at showcasing such talents, often drawing masses of undiscovered, amateur Pinoy &quot;rapistas&quot;.

Artists representing other elements include b-boy crews such as The Battle Krew (TBK), Funk Roots Crew, Soulstice Crew, Air Grounds Crew, Tru Asiatik Tribe (TAT) and The Balikbayan Tribe (BBT); &quot;grapistas&quot; such as Flip-1, Bonz, Ripe-1, Dope, Chas-1, Meow and Xzyle, and graffiti crews such as Samahan Batang Aerosol (SBA), Pinoy Bomber Crew (PBC), Pinoy Style Insight (PSI), Day Night Bombers (DNB), Katipunan Street Team (KST) and Crime In Style Crew (CIS), as well as beatboxers Christopher Oreo a.k.a. BoomBuster and Cool MC Norman B (of the Bass Rhyme Posse).

===Beatbox===
Beatboxing is another element of hip-hop; Xam Penalba a.k.a. The Bigg X represented the Philippines at the Beatbox World Championship in May 2015 at the Astra Kulturhaus Berline. He is a member of the Philippine Human Beatbox Alliance and beatbox group Microphone Mechanics with members G-Who, Leaf, Mouthfx and Abdhul.

==Filipino-American hip-hop==
===Birth of a culture===
Filipino-American hip-hop culture bases its historical roots in the Filipino American, Latino American and African-American neighborhoods along the West Coast, specifically in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, and San Diego. The movement that had been born in the South Bronx among Jamaican, Puerto Rican and African-American youth in turn had its West Coast identity formed within the respective African-American, Filipino and Latino communities. Similar to the Filipino-American zoot suiters, be-boppers and ballroom dancers of previous generations, the dynamics within these respective communities reincarnated itself once again in the form of hip hop. Since the 1990 Census, Filipino Americans have made up the second largest Asian Pacific American group in the United States (after Chinese Americans), and, until 2000, were the largest Asian group in California. In West Coast hip hop, their role has been comparable to that of Puerto Rican artists on the East Coast, who were an integral part, along with African Americans, in the creation of the foundations of hip hop culture.

As early as the late 1970s, during hip hop&#x27;s infancy, pioneering mobile Bay Area Filipino mobile DJ crews such as Sound Explosion, Unlimited Sounds, Electric Sounds, Fusion, Ladda Sounds, 3-Style Attractions, Ultimate Creations, Sound Patrol, Soundsation, Sound City Productions, Kicks Company, Images, Non-Stop Boogie, Imperial Sounds, Unique Musique, Nite Life Sensations, Rok A Long and Sound Sequence among many others helped capitalize on the massive Filipino party scene by introducing the newly formed genre of music while spreading its popularity throughout South San Francisco and its surrounding areas through paid gigs in house/block parties, family gatherings, school pep rallies, weddings and church halls; primarily playing and mixing electro funk alongside Latin freestyle. Rival crews would often one-up each other by showcasing superior equipment and providing elaborate set-ups. Early mobile DJ stars included DJ Ren (born Rene Anies), founder of one of the first Filipino American DJ crews Electric Sounds, DJ Dynamix (born Dave Refuerzo) of Sound Patrol who established 3-Style Attractions, a widely known mobile DJ crew in the Bay Area, and DJ D-Styles (born Dave Cuasito), who in 1987 established the mobile DJ crew Sound City Productions. In 1983, a real-estate agent by the name of Mark Bradford established Imagine, which began primarily as a showcase for Filipino DJ talent in and around the Bay Area and came to serve as the premier event for DJs until the founders&#x27; murder in 1991. The movement reached its pinnacle in 1987, when more than one hundred mobile DJ crews participated in DJ sound clashes and showcases. By the late 1980s, the &quot;mobile DJ&quot; movement had declined in popularity and had given way to the &quot;turntablist&quot;, largely due to the rise of Q-Bert and the innovation of scratching within the DJ community. The legacy of the &quot;mobile DJ&quot; lived on however, because many of the Bay Area turntablists that went on to define the art in the 1990s such as Q-Bert himself, along with DJ Shortkut, often had their beginnings in mobile DJ work. Also in New York City, early hip hop musician and salsa legend Joe Bataan (half Filipino and half African American) had one of the first rap hits, &quot;Rap-O Clap-O&quot; in 1979, released on his Salsoul label. In 1981, DJ Nasty Nes (of Rap Attack and NastyMix Records fame) of Seattle launched the specialty show &quot;Fresh Tracks&quot; on Seattle&#x27;s 1250 KFOX introducing the first ever hip-hop radio station on the West Coast. He went on to serve as the DJ for pioneering Seattle rapper Sir Mix-A-Lot.

In the 1980s, several legendary Filipino b-boy groups such as the Renegade Rockers, Knuckleneck Tribe, Rock Force Crew, Daly City Breakers, Jughead Tribe and Concrete Rockers also emerged from the Bay Area rivaling even the New York City-based Rock Steady Crew, whose official West Coast contingent is known to consist of several Filipino American members. Kalifornia Noize Terrorists&#x27; Paul Sirate, better known as P-Kid emerged from the Bay Area becoming one of the early premier breakdancers and later went on to MCing and producing, lacing tracks for the likes of the Bronx&#x27;s Terror Squad and L.A.&#x27;s Pharcyde. Elsewhere in the Bay Area, pioneering Filipina rapper Lani Luv (born Melanie Cagonot) became one of the early West Coast female MCs.

Several tagging crews such as Oakland&#x27;s Those Damn Kids (TDK) were some of the originators of &quot;graf art&quot; on the West Coast. It was during this time in 1983 that TDK&#x27;s King Dream (born Michael Francisco) surfaced out of the graf art world. Francisco utilized his pieces to celebrate, express and educate from his own Filipino American background in order to promote tolerance while simultaneously strengthening bonds with others from differing cultures, eventually achieving international recognition. Now deceased (Dream was murdered in 2000), he is considered by many to have been one of the greatest and most influential graf writers whose work had been expressive of his urban environment while focusing on social issues concerning not only Filipino Americans, but also other people of color in America such as police brutality, racism, nationwide liberation and rebellion.

Even further north of the American border in Canada, Filipino hip hop has established an active scene, with the likes of Montreal&#x27;s New Elementz, Vancouver&#x27;s conscious rap-tandem The On Point Collective, the veteran emcee Jae Spillz, Filipino rapper One3D, and the hip hop power label Cashtown Records; home to a variety of artists including the underground Tagalog emcees Franchizze One and Lyrikal Abstrakt, or Dos Armados, who went on to form their own label subsidiary, Southeast Cartel.

===Rise of the turntablists===
By the 1990s, hip hop artists of Filipino descent (particularly turntablists like DJ Qbert, Mix Master Mike, and the Invisibl Skratch Piklz) achieved prominence and came to dominate the DJ art form of scratching, introducing the world to a more innovative style of scratching utilizing a wide variety of new techniques, including the playing of actual melodies, as well as the inventions of the &quot;crab scratch&quot;, &quot;tweak scratch&quot;, &quot;strobing&quot;, and furthering the development of &quot;flare scratching&quot;.

In 1996, the International Turntable Federation, which hosts the largest international turntablist competitions, was established by Alex Aquino. DJ Glaze of Long Beach&#x27;s Foesum have together been staples in the West Coast gangster rap scene since the G-funk era of the 1990s. DJ Babu (born Chris Oroc) has gained notoriety for his work with the turtablism group Beat Junkies and the alternative hip hop act Dilated Peoples. Many other notable DJ champions from other countries around the world such as Canada, Australia, Japan and Germany have also been of Filipino descent.

Other notable DJs include Joseph &quot;DJ ELITE&quot; Netherland (Hawaiʻi&#x27;s first hip hop DJ champion in 1990), DJ Kuttin Kandi (the first woman to place in the US finals of the prestigious DMC USA competition in 1998), DJ Roli Rho (1999 East Coast regional DMC Champ/1999 &amp; 2000 Vibe Music Seminar Champion of New York City&#x27;s 5th Platoon), DJ Icy Ice of Los Angeles&#x27; KDAY 93.5 FM, DJ E-Man of Los Angeles&#x27; Power 106 FM, DJ Marlino a.k.a. da5footafunk of San Diego&#x27;s XHITZ-FM Z90.3, DJ Enferno (2003 US DMC Champ/2003 1st runner-up DMC World) and DJ Geometrix of the Trooperz Crew, both from the Washington DC area, and DJ Manila Ice (2007 DMC US finalist) and DJ Jester a.k.a. the Filipino Fist, both from Texas. Two longtime staples for entertainment in Sacramento are DJ Eddie Edul and DJ Billy Lane.

In the late 2010s and early 2020s, Ruby Ibarra gained prominence as a raptivist who spoke against American imperialism and highlighted the experiences of the Filipino-American community. In her debut album, &quot;CIRCA91,&quot; she rapped in three languages (Filipino, English, and her native Waray) and spoke against the Filipino patriarchy, colorism, and corruption in the Philippines.

===apl.de.ap (Allan Pineda Lindo)===
Perhaps one of the most successful mainstream Filipino-American rappers is the Black Eyed Peas&#x27; apl.de.ap, who has released songs such as &quot;The Apl Song&quot; (from &quot;Elephunk&quot;), &quot;Bebot&quot; (from &quot;Monkey Business&quot;), and &quot;Mare&quot; (from &quot;The E.N.D.&quot;) which not only contain Filipino (Tagalog) lyrics but also native Filipino musical elements. Pineda has also founded his own record label, the Los Angeles-based Jeepney Music, to help discover and promote Filipino hip-hop talent from both the United States and the Philippines. &quot;The Apl Song&quot; not only contains elements of Tagalog and Filipino elements, but the track itself according to video producer Christina DeHaven, represents Allan Pineda Lindo&#x27;s view of the Philippines when he travels back for the first time since he was 14 years old. In the English verses of the song, Pineda describes aspects of Filipino life back home which is seen in the lyrics, &quot;How would you feel if you had to catch your meal, Build a hut to live and to eat and chill in, Having to pump the water outta the ground?&quot;. The shifting between Tagalog and English can be interpreted as showing both languages as equal or in an equal hierarchical relationship to one another which is especially important having included another language other than English in an American pop song, even though English is one of the two official languages of the Philippines.

===Chad Hugo (producer)===
One of the most successful Filipino-American producers is Virginia Beach&#x27;s Chad Hugo. One half of the popular music production duo the Neptunes, Hugo, with his production partner Pharrell, have laced chart-topping hits for the likes of Jay-Z, Nelly, Gwen Stefani and Snoop Dogg, among many others. He has also collaborated with the Black Eyed Peas&#x27; apl.de.ap, making an appearance in apl&#x27;s music video for &quot;The Apl Song&quot;.

=== Ez Mil ===
Ezekiel Miller, also known professionally as Ez Mil, is a Filipino-American rapper, singer, songwriter and producer. He rose to prominence after his song &quot;Panalo&quot; gained public attention. At age 25, he became the first Filipino artist (and the third rapper, after 50 Cent and Stat Quo) to have a direct joint deal with all three of Eminem&#x27;s record labels: Shady Records, Aftermath Entertainment, and Interscope Records.

==Media==
===Film===
The 2000 documentary film &quot;Beats, Rhymes and Resistance: Pilipinos and Hip Hop in Los Angeles&quot; (produced and directed by Lakandiwa de Leon, Dawn Mabalon and Jonathan Ramos) chronicles the development of hip hop culture among Filipino Americans in Southern California during the 1990s.

===Radio===

There were two FM stations in the Philippines that played all kinds of R&amp;B, hip hop and rap music. These are the now defunct radio stations Power 108 FM and Blazin&#x27; 105.9 FM. The former project known as &#x27;Project: Hip hop&#x27; was founded in 2002 by three high school friends, namely DJ Caine, MC Satoshi and Quaizy Ileon. Former radio stations such as 89 DMZ are now online radio stations, streaming live on the Internet.

In 2007, Wave 891 eliminated its pop jazz/easy listening format and switched to full hip hop and R&amp;B in order to retain the Pinoy hip hop scene. Another radio station that features Pinoy hip hop artists is Monster Radio RX 93.1 (DWRX 93.1 FM), which also plays American hip-hop and R&amp;B.

In 2014, the radio station Wish 107.5 launched the Wish Mobile Radio Bus, the very first FM station-on-wheels in the country which allowed Filipino artists to perform live and have their performances uploaded online soon after their performance. Four years later, a US counterpart, the Wish Bus USA was launched for Filipino artists based in the US. These gave hip hop artists more exposure, with YouTube videos of their performances gaining millions of views. Filipino hip hop artists who have given notable performances on the Wish Bus include Smugglaz, Curse One, Dello, Flict-G, Shanti Dope, Ex Battalion, Gloc-9, Al James, Loonie, Ron Henley, Abra, Allmo$t, Pricetagg, CLR, Michael Pacquiao, Ez Mil, and many more.

<doc id="559423" wikidata="Q2732430" url="?curid=559423" title="Hastings 1895 chess tournament">
<text>The Hastings 1895 chess tournament was a round-robin tournament of chess conducted at the Brassey Institute in Hastings, England from 5 August to 2 September 1895.

Hastings 1895 was arguably the strongest tournament in history at the time it occurred. All of the top players of the generation competed. It was one of the first times such a &quot;super-tournament&quot; was conducted.

Harry Nelson Pillsbury, a young American unknown in Europe, was the surprise winner with 16½ out of 21 points – ahead of Mikhail Chigorin (16) and world champion Emanuel Lasker (15½). The top five finishers were invited to play in the Saint Petersburg 1895–96 chess tournament.

Following the success of the event, the Hastings tournament would become an annual feature. The organizers and players produced a Book of the Tournament, in which the participants annotated their own games. Like the Tournament, the Book too became an annual feature and was of very high instructional value.

Many of the games were of high quality and hard-fought. Here are two examples:

===Steinitz versus von Bardeleben===

In round ten, the position in the diagram arose after a Giuoco Piano: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.c3 Nf6 5.d4 exd4 6.cxd4 Bb4+ 7.Nc3 d5 8.exd5 Nxd5 9.0-0 Be6 10.Bg5 Be7 11.Bxd5 Bxd5 12.Nxd5 Qxd5 13.Bxe7 Nxe7 14.Re1 f6 15.Qe2 Qd7 16.Rac1 c6 17.d5! cxd5 18.Nd4 Kf7 19.Ne6 Rhc8 20.Qg4 g6 21.Ng5+ Ke8. At this point Steinitz played one of the most famous moves in history:

:22. Rxe7+ 
Black cannot capture the white rook: 22...Qxe7 23.Rxc8+ Rxc8 24.Qxc8+ Qd8 25.Qxd8+, etc. and White wins with his extra piece; while 22...Kxe7 23.Re1+ Kd6 24.Qb4+ Rc5 25.Re6+! wins as well (the often-mentioned 25.Ne6 doesn&#x27;t amount to much, for example 25...Rc8 26.Qf4+ Kc6 27.Qa4+ Kd6). White&#x27;s replies are also limited, however, because Black is threatening mate with ...Rxc1, as well as threatening to capture White&#x27;s queen and knight. In order to prevent ...Rxc1, Steinitz&#x27;s rook now &quot;thumbs its nose&quot; at the black king: repeatedly checking right in front of the king, which cannot capture it.

:22... Kf8 23. Rf7+ Kg8 24. Rg7+ Kh8 25. Rxh7+!!
This crucial move eliminates the h-pawn and allows White to bring in his queen to attack without ever allowing Black to play ...Rxc1 and mate. Bowing to the inevitable (or perhaps frustrated that even with mate in one, he could not capitalize), von Bardeleben simply left the tournament hall, letting his time run out. Steinitz demonstrated for the spectators how the game might have continued: 25...Kg8 26.Rg7+ Kh8 27.Qh4+ Kxg7 28.Qh7+ Kf8 29.Qh8+ Ke7 30.Qg7+ Ke8 31.Qg8+ Ke7 32.Qf7+ Kd8 33.Qf8+ Qe8 34.Nf7+ Kd7 35.Qd6

This game won the first in the tournament.

===Pillsbury versus Gunsberg===

The game was played in the last round. Pillsbury was leading the field by half a point. He had assumed that a draw would be enough, and the game therefore opened with the relatively placid Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined. Pieces were rapidly traded off the board, reaching the position in the diagram, when Pillsbury realized that Chigorin was winning his game and therefore he would have to win to take clear first.

:1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.e3 g6 4.Nc3 Bg7 5.Nf3 Nf6 6.Bd3 0-0 7.Ne5 dxc4 8.Bxc4 Nd5 9.f4 Be6 10.Qb3 b5 11.Bxd5 Bxd5 12.Nxd5 Qxd5 13.Qxd5 cxd5 14.Nd3 Nd7 15.Bd2 Rfc8 16.Ke2 e6 17.Rhc1 Bf8 18.Rxc8 Rxc8 19.Rc1 Rxc1 20.Bxc1 Bd6 21.Bd2 Kf8 22.Bb4 Ke7 23.Bc5 a6 24.b4 f6 25.g4 Bxc5 26.bxc5 Nb8 (&quot;diagram&quot;) 27.f5 g5 28.Nb4 a5 29.c6! Kd6 30.fxe6! Nxc6 31.Nxc6 Kxc6 32.e4! dxe4 33.d5+ Kd6 34.Ke3 b4 35.Kxe4 a4 36.Kd4 h5 37.gxh5 a3 38.Kc4 f5 39.h6 f4 40.h7 Black resigned.

<text>Greystone station is a commuter rail station on the Metro-North Railroad Hudson Line, located in the Greystone neighborhood of Yonkers, New York. The station has two high-level side platforms, each eight cars long, serving the outer tracks of the four-track line.

==History==
Greystone station was originally built in 1899 by developer Charles Harriman as &quot;Harriman station&quot; for the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad, who insisted that he rename the station &quot;Greystone&quot; in 1910. A pedestrian bridge was built in 1915. As with many NYCRR stations in Westchester County, the station became a Penn Central station upon the merger between NYC and Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968, until it was taken over by Conrail in 1976, and then by Metro-North in 1983.

<text>The M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle (CEV) is a full-tracked vehicle used for breaching, obstacle removal, and pioneering operations. Production commenced in 1965 and ceased in 1987. A total of 312 of all variants of these armored engineer vehicles were produced.

==Design==
===Development and production===
Prototype development began in the late 1940s at Ft. Belvoir, VA by the US Army Engineer Research &amp; Development Laboratories in conjunction with Chrysler. These early T39 Demolition Tank prototypes were based on the M26 using several different modified turrets, demolition guns and heavy mortars. The T118 prototypes used the T95 hull beginning in 1960. Both prototypes went through extensive testing at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds through 1963 and final trials in 1964. The T118E1, with a modified M60A1 turret was then accepted into service as the M728 in 1965 and achieved operational capability in 1968. The turrets for the M728 were manufactured at Chrysler Corp.&#x27;s Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant, Warren, Michigan. Final assembly and mating to the vehicle hulls was performed at Anniston Army Depot in Alabama. Initial production of the M728 was from 1965 to 1972. Many of the M782A1s were former M60A2 Patton tanks converted to M728A1s from 1982 to 1987. All M728A1s were converted and assembled at the Anniston Army Depot under contract with General Dynamics Land Systems with a total of 312 of all variants produced.

===Description===
The M728 is a full-tracked combat engineer vehicle designed to provide maximum ballistic protection for the crew. It is a heavily armed derivative of the M60 series tank modified to provide a mobile and maneuverable weapon for combat support of ground troops and vehicles. The M728 vehicle is used for breaching, obstacle removal, and pioneering operations. 
Although the M728 consists of a tank hull and a short-barreled turret, it is not a tank and should not be routinely used against enemy tanks. It is an excellent heavy assault support vehicle when used as part of a combined engineer-infantry team. The CEV is issued two per Engineer Company in the Heavy Division, two per Engineer Company in Corps (Mechanized), three per Engineer Company in Armor/Infantry Separate Brigades and three per Engineer Company in the Armored Cavalry Regiment. 

It is usually equipped with either a hydraulically operated M9 dozer blade assembly or a D7 mine plough. The M9 dozer blade Assembly is used for clearing the way, filling depressions, leveling ground and for other purposes. The D7 mine plough is a V-shaped plough that performs countermine activities by lifting surface laid mines and pushing them to the side as the vehicle moves forward. They are controlled by the driver.
A winch and retractable A-frame crane are mounted on the turret for lifting, carrying and winching operations. The hull front contains the driver&#x27;s compartment, controls and instruments. The hull rear contains the engine, transmission, fuel tanks, and related automotive components. The turret has positions for the commander, gunner, and loader. The vehicle is also equipped with an NBC protection system for the crew.
It can produce a limited smokescreen by dumping raw diesel fuel into the exhaust system to visually obscure the area around the vehicle as well as provide a limited vehicle recovery capability.

===Armament===
The vehicle is armed with a 165mm M135 short-barreled demolition gun with 30 rounds of HEP (high explosive, plastic) ammunition. The M135 is a license-built copy of the 165 mm L9A1 gun that was used on the British Army&#x27;s FV4003 Centurion Mk.5 AVRE (Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers) tank. Depending on the usage, the gun can be depressed and elevated against targets up to an effective range of . The gun&#x27;s primary purpose is for clearing defensive fixtures and obstacles, such as walls, fences, roadblocks and bunkers, or for destroying buildings and is generally not meant to be for use in anti-personnel or anti-tank warfare. The pushing and heaving effects caused by the HEP round&#x27;s base detonating fuze and large amount of explosive can demolish barriers and knock down walls. One round creates a 1-foot (0.3 m) diameter hole in a 7-inch (178 mm) thick reinforced concrete wall. The round&#x27;s effects against bunkers and field fortifications are dramatic, often crushing or smashing entire walls. The gun fires two types of fixed ammunition, the M123E1 HEP Round and the M623 Target Practice Round. The main gun has a coaxial 7.62×51mm NATO M240E1 machine gun, with 2,000 rounds of 7.62mm ammunition. In addition, a .50 caliber M85 machine gun is mounted in the commander&#x27;s cupola; this has 600 rounds of ammunition.

==Service history==

===United States===
It was first deployed in 1968 during the Vietnam War. The M728 was used in fire support, base security, counter ambush fire, direct assault of fortified positions, and limited reconnaissance by fire. They were also deployed at this time to West Germany during the Cold War to support combat engineer operations and participated in annual Reforger exercises until 1991.

During mine-clearing operations in the Gulf War, the M1 MCRS was found to be cumbersome, heavy and hard to transport. In addition, since they were originally designed for the firmer soil conditions of Europe, its rollers were unsuitable for the softer soil of the desert. Instead of rolling, they often merely skidded, pushing soil in front of them until they bogged down. A mine clearing-rake was specially designed and fabricated for the CEV in operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. The full-width rake allows the CEV to clear minefields in non-cohesive, granular soils such as sand. The mine-clearing rake is a V-shaped tined plough that performs countermine activities by lifting buried mines with its tines and pushing them to the side as the vehicle moves forward. Attached to any M728 CEV&#x27;s D7 mine plough or M60 series tank via a M9 dozer blade assembly, the mine-clearing rake also uses an aluminum skid shoe which protrudes from the front of the tines and allows the rake to maintain a consistent plowing depth. It clears a path wide, accommodating heavy tanks and other armored vehicles. It weighs and is easily assembled and installed.

They were active during the Desert Shield phase of the Gulf War in clearing suspected minefields and in creating temporary defensive fighting positions and staging areas in the deserts near the Iraqi Saudi border. The M728A1s of the 24th Infantry Division and US XVIII Airborne Corps breached the openings for the &quot;left hook&quot; flanking of Iraqi forces during the Desert Storm phase of the war, but they were left behind once they began the pursuit and exploitation phase of the operation. A CEV of the 6th Battalion, 6th Regiment, 1st Armored Division, fired 21 M123E1 rounds into the stubbornly defended town of Al Busayyah: &quot;That totally destroyed all the resistance in the town,&quot; according to the battalion commander. After the cease-fire, CEV guns were used to break up coke piles that had formed around approximately 20% of the burning oil wells in Kuwait. According to the US Army, the guns reduced the time to break up coke formation from as long as two days to 15 minutes. Commanders were unanimous in their opinion that the engineer force needed an M1 chassis based vehicle for heavy breaching and gap crossing equipment to fully support the M1 Abrams tank and M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles.

Three M728CEVs were temporally acquired for use by the United States Department of Justice&#x27;s FBI and ATF SWAT teams to conduct Operation Showtime during the 1993 Siege of the Branch Davidian Complex near Waco, Texas. They were provided to the ATF by Task Force Six of the Texas Army National Guard from Ft. Hood. They were used to destroy perimeter fences and structures and to crush automobiles to prevent escape from the compound.

US Army M728A1s were deployed in support of the United Nations&#x27; Resolution, NATO led Implementation Force (IFOR) peacekeeping force in the former Yugoslavia in December 1995. Their initial mission was to assist in protecting and demining the international airport at Sarajevo. By September 1996 their mission had expanded to include road clearance, bunker demolition and protecting humanitarian aid and assist relief delivery in the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as to help protect civilian refugees when required by the Red Cross. Task Force Eagle assumed control of its area of responsibility during a ceremony with United Nations forces at Eagle Base in Tuzla on December 20 consisting of elements of the 1st Armored Division and its supporting elements from the U.S. V Corps and were joined by forces from twelve other nations. During the campaign in Bosnia, at least three M60 Panther MCDVs were used in conjunction with the M728. The Panther would lead the convoy followed by the M728. The Panther operator would control the vehicle from the M728 via a remote control system during road clearing operations. There was a Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) camera system attached to the front of the Panther so the remote-operator could see where the tank was going through a screen on the remote control unit. The radio control signal was received by a long antenna protruding from the engine deck. The M728 also provided a good secondary clearing action by use of its bulldozer blade as it followed the Panther. It would skim the trail cleared by the Panther pushing away debris and keeping the route clear for other following vehicles, also smoothing out the road surface and could be used for filling in craters left by any exploding mines or ordnance. The CEV was also useful for quickly recovering the Panther should it become stuck, and its crane allowed easy loading and unloading of the mine roller onto transport vehicles. The 1st Armored Division was relieved by the 1st Infantry Division and returned to Germany in November 1996.

The M728 has been determined by the US Army to be inadequate to fully support the M1 Abrams and M2 Bradley, also cited were the rising costs to maintain and difficulty in acquiring parts for a low density piece of equipment and was retired from combat use with no clear replacement in 2000. In the late 1990s, the Army decided it could not afford to continue developing complicated, maintenance-heavy vehicles for this purpose. The M1 Grizzly Combat Mobility Vehicle (CMV) was canceled in 2001, and the prototype developed never went into full production. The Marine Corps however persisted and funded its own development and testing of the M1150 assault breacher vehicle. As of 2009 it is still used by the Army National Guard and US Army Reserve. In 2018 the US Army began to phase out the M728 from service with the Army Reserves and National Guard replacing them with the M1150 and is to be completely withdrawn from US service by 2024.

===Other users===

The eight M728s formerly in service with the Singapore Army were retired in 2016, having been replaced by the Leopard 2-based AEV 3 Kodiak armoured engineer vehicle (AEV).&lt;ref name=&quot;armstrade.sipri.org/armstrade&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish Army began the &quot;Programa Coraza&quot; – 2000 (&quot;Program Armor – 2000&quot;) in March 1995.
One of its goals was the development of a new combat engineer vehicle, the CZ-10/25E &quot;Alacran&quot;, based on the M60A1 hull and converted from former M60A3 Patton MBTs with upgrades to the engine. It has an external appearance similar to the M728 CEV, but without the 165 mm demolition gun, being replaced by a special backhoe. It also has a front-mounted dozer blade and is armed with a machine gun. An initial batch of 38 vehicles have been produced in close liaison with engineers at the Army Logistics Command.

Portugal retired its M728CEVs in 2013.

As of 2015 they continue in service with the armies of a few other countries including Morocco and Saudi Arabia.

==Variants==
* T118E1 – prototype for the M728 based on the T95 hull
* M728 – version mated to the M60 hull
* M728A1 – version mated to the M60A1 RISE hull
* M60 CZ-10/25E Alacran – Spanish Army variant converted from upgraded M60A1 hulls
Additional equipment
* M9 bulldozer kit for the M60 series (SNL G306) The M9 bulldozer installed on the M728 will increase the vehicle&#x27;s weight by 4.45 tons (4.04 metric tons). It is controlled by the driver.
*M58 mine-clearing line charge (MICLIC) : The system consists of the launcher mounted on a M200A1 tracked trailer, an M147 firing kit, an M58A4 line charge and a 5-inch (127 mm) Mk22 Mod 4 rocket. The line charge is 350 feet (107 meters) long and contains 5 pounds (2.27 kg) per linear foot of C-4 explosive. In the event a MICLIC fails to detonate normally, it can be manually activated by time-delay fuses every few feet along the length of it. The MICLIC can provide a rapidly emplaced lane through mine and wire obstacles up to 14 meters wide and 100 meters deep. Mines containing magnetic or other non-pressure-sensitive fuses may escape destruction from the blast overpressure, but will usually be uncovered and blown to the side out of the lane. Armored vehicles avoid mines by keeping the left track in the cleared centerline. Cleared lanes should also be proofed with plows or rollers when available.
* M1 mine-clearing roller system (MCRS): Installed on the front of the tank through a removable adapter, it provides the capability for neutralization of anti-tank (AT) land mines, which are buried or laid on the surface, in the track path of the vehicle. The MCRS consists of two roller banks with two push-arm assemblies. Each roller bank has four rollers, which apply ground pressure higher than that exerted by the tank. This principle ensures the explosion of pressure fused anti tank mines, which would otherwise explode under the track itself. Additionally an anti-magnetic mine activating device (AMMAD) is connected between the two roller banks. The system weighs 10 short tons (9.07 metric tons).
*D7 surface mine plow (SMP): A track-width plow designed to skim the surface of a flat roadway or trail, not to defeat buried mines. It is controlled by the driver.
*Track-width mine plow (TWMP): Uses a raking action to clear a safe path by bringing concealed or buried mines and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) to the surface and moving them wide and clear of the vehicle. It can be fitted with a AMMAD to counter magnetic influence fused mines.
*Full Width Mine Rake (FWMR) : A rake assembly for unearthing and disposing of buried and surface laid mines in sand and loose earth. Specifically designed for use in operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm.

<text>Glenwood station is a commuter rail stop on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line, located in the Glenwood neighborhood of Yonkers, New York.

==Station layout==
The station has two slightly offset high-level side platforms each able to accommodate eight cars.

== Abandoned power plant ==
Between the Glenwood station and the Hudson River lies the abandoned Yonkers Power Station of the New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad, a massive building which was constructed in 1907 to hold electrical generators to provide power for the electrification of the railroad.

In 2008 the Preservation League of New York State named the plant as one of the seven most endangered sites in the state, and in 2013 the building began to be renovated into the &quot;PowerHouse&quot;, an &quot;arts-focused event complex with eventual plans for restaurants, a hotel and a marina.&quot; Phase One of the conversion is expected to finish in 2016 at the cost of $70 million, while Phase Two, which includes the restaurant, hotel and marina, is expected to cost $80 million, and could take up to ten years to complete.

<doc id="559434" wikidata="Q885669" url="?curid=559434" title="Richard A. Snelling">
<text>Richard Arkwright Snelling (February 18, 1927August 13, 1991) was an American businessman, politician, and the 76th and 78th governor of Vermont from 1977 to 1985 and from January 10, 1991, until his death.

A native of Allentown, Pennsylvania, Snelling was educated in Allentown and served in the United States Army at the end of World War II and during the post-war occupation of Germany. He graduated from Harvard University in 1948 and embarked on a business career, working for companies in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Vermont. After settling in Vermont, he founded Shelburne Industries, a maker of ski racks and other ski equipment. He became active in politics as a Republican, served a term in the Vermont House of Representatives (1959–1961), and ran unsuccessfully for Vermont Senate in 1956, lieutenant governor in 1964, and governor in 1966. In 1972, Snelling was again elected to the Vermont House. He was reelected in 1974, and served from 1973 to 1977. In his second term, Snelling was chosen to serve as majority leader.

In 1976, Snelling was the successful Republican nominee for governor. He was re-elected three times, and served from 1977 to 1985. In 1986, Snelling was the unsuccessful Republican nominee for the United States Senate and was defeated by incumbent Democrat Patrick Leahy. In 1990, he was the successful Republican nominee for governor. He was inaugurated in January 1991, and served until his death. Snelling&#x27;s family was prominent in Vermont politics; his wife Barbara served as lieutenant governor and a member of the state senate. His daughter Diane succeeded her mother as a state senator. His son Mark was an unsuccessful candidate for lieutenant governor in 2010.

==Early life and education==
Snelling was born in Allentown, Pennsylvania on February 18, 1927, the son of chemist Walter O. Snelling and Helen Marjorie Gahring.

He was educated in Allentown public schools and graduated from Allentown High School in 1944, completing the requirements six months ahead of his classmates as part of an accelerated program for young men intending to enter the military during World War II. During his high school years, Snelling was a member of the National Honor Society, and the school&#x27;s track and field, swimming, and wrestling teams.

After graduating from Allentown High School, Snelling briefly attended the University of Havana in Havana, Cuba, and then Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, before transferring to Harvard University. At Lehigh, Snelling played on the Lehigh University football and wrestling teams. While at Harvard, Snelling was on the dean&#x27;s list, played on the varsity football team, was president of the Harvard Conservative League, and taught swimming and aquatic safety.

==Career==
===Military service===
In October 1944, Snelling enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps Reserve. When the program was discontinued in early 1945, he transferred to the Army Enlisted Reserve Corps. In May 1945, Snelling entered Army active duty at the New Cumberland Defense Depot. He served at the end of World War II and in the post-war occupation of Germany, and carried out assignments as an investigator and information bulletin editor. He attained the rank of technician fifth grade and was discharged at Fort Dix, New Jersey in October 1946. He then returned to Harvard, where he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in government and economics in 1948. For several years after moving to Vermont, Snelling was active in the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary where he served as an officer. In 1956, Snelling was elected vice commander of Burlington Flotilla 802, and was appointed as the flotilla&#x27;s inspector of facilities.

===Business===
After graduating from college, Snelling was employed at Joseph Breck &amp; Sons, a Boston wholesaler of kitchen and garden supplies. Within a year, he had advanced from working in the company&#x27;s warehouse to assistant to the company&#x27;s president. He then moved to Philadelphia, where he led a venture to take over the bankrupt Henry A. Dreer, Inc., a retail and wholesale distributor of plants and seeds. Snelling, his management team, and the Dreer employees who remained soon restored the company to profitability. In 1953, Snelling moved to Vermont to take the position of assistant to the president of Colonial Motors, a Burlington car dealership. In 1955, Snelling became manager of Green Mountain Television Corporation, an early Cable television proponent, of which he became president.

A longtime resident of Shelburne, in 1957, Snelling founded Shelburne Industries, a maker of wire and metal products that later specialized in ski racks and other ski equipment. The venture proved successful and made Snelling a millionaire. In addition to heading Shelburne Industries, he served on the boards of directors for several other companies. His business affiliations include the Young Presidents&#x27; Association, the Chief Executives Organization, and the World Business Council. He was director of Ski Industries of America and Associated Industries of Vermont.

===Political career===
In 1956, Snelling ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the Vermont Senate. Snelling served in the Vermont House of Representatives from 1959 to 1961. He was a delegate to Republican National Conventions in 1960, 1968, 1980. In addition, Snelling served as chair of the Chittenden County Republican Committee and a member of Vermont Republican State Executive Committee from 1963 to 1966.

Snelling was the unsuccessful Republican nominee for lieutenant governor in 1964, and for governor in 1966. In 1972, he was again elected to the Vermont House, and he served from 1973 to 1977. During his final term, Snelling was the House&#x27;s majority leader.

===Governorship===

In the 1976 Vermont gubernatorial election, Snelling was elected governor. He was re-elected three times, in 1978, 1980, and 1982, and served until January 1985. During his governorship, Snelling worked to protect the environment by opposing a plan to allow uranium mining in Vermont and barring the sale of phosphate detergents, arguing that they pollute water by increasing algae growth. He was also commended for using his business experience to promote economic growth by attracting industry to the state. Snelling advocated for the New Federalism of President Ronald Reagan because Snelling believed that government worked best when it remained close to the people. However, Snelling objected when Reagan&#x27;s plan to turn several federal programs over to the states did not include federal financing and imposed budget cuts on the states.

Snelling was not a candidate for reelection in 1984. In 1986, he was the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate and lost to incumbent Patrick Leahy. After leaving office, Snelling took over active management of his business and financial interests. In addition, he sailed frequently on a yacht he purchased after leaving the governorship. Snelling traveled extensively, including a 1989 trip to Kenya.

===Return to governorship===

In 1990, Snelling ran again for governor, intending to use his business acumen and previous gubernatorial service to address state fiscal problems caused by the post-Reagan economic recession. He won a fifth two-year term, and devoted most of his effort to balancing the state budget and restoring its financial health. As recounted by Ralph G. Wright, the Democrat then serving as Speaker of the House, at the beginning of his term, Snelling took the unprecedented step of visiting the speaker&#x27;s office unannounced to ask for a meeting with Wright so they could craft budget cuts and tax increases to address the budget deficit. The Vermont General Assembly responded to Snelling&#x27;s initiative by negotiating and enacting the largest tax increase in Vermont&#x27;s history, more than $90 million, while also imposing deep cuts in state programs.

==Personal life==
On June 14, 1947, at age 20, he married 19-year-old Barbara Weil. They had four children, Jacqueline, Mark, Andrew, and Diane.

After Snelling&#x27;s death, his wife served as Vermont&#x27;s lieutenant governor and state senator.

His daughter Diane B. Snelling served in the Vermont Senate after being appointed to succeed her mother in 2002. She resigned in 2016 to accept appointment as head of the Vermont Natural Resources Board.

Snelling&#x27;s son Mark was an unsuccessful candidate for the 2010 Republican nomination for lieutenant governor.

==Death and legacy==
Snelling died of a heart attack at his home in Shelburne, Vermont on August 13, 1991. He was succeeded by Howard Dean. Snelling was interred at Shelburne Village Cemetery.

The Snelling Center for Government at the University of Vermont was named in honor of Richard and Barbara Snelling.

<text>Kharosthi script (), also known as the Gandhari script (), was an ancient Indic script originally developed in the Gandhara Region of north-western Indian subcontinent, between the 5th and 3rd century BCE. used primarily by the people of Gandhara alongside various parts of South Asia and Central Asia. it remained in use until it died out in its homeland around the 5th century CE.

It was also in use in Bactria, the Kushan Empire, Sogdia, and along the Silk Road. There is some evidence it may have survived until the 7th century in Khotan and Niya, both cities in East Turkestan.

==History==

The name Kharosthi may derive from the Hebrew &quot;kharosheth&quot;, a Semitic word for writing, or from Old Iranian &quot;*xšaθra-pištra&quot;, which means &quot;royal writing&quot;. The script was earlier also known as &quot;Indo-Bactrian script&quot;, &quot;Kabul script&quot; and &quot;Arian-Pali&quot;.

Scholars are not in agreement as to whether the Kharosthi script evolved gradually, or was the deliberate work of a single inventor. An analysis of the script forms shows a clear dependency on the Aramaic alphabet but with extensive modifications. Kharosthi seems to be derived from a form of Aramaic used in administrative work during the reign of Darius the Great, rather than the monumental cuneiform used for public inscriptions. One theory suggests that the Aramaic script arrived with the Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley in 500 BCE and evolved over the next 200+ years to reach its final form by the 3rd century BCE where it appears in some of the Edicts of Ashoka. However, no intermediate forms have yet been found to confirm this evolutionary model, and rock and coin inscriptions from the 3rd century BCE onward show a unified and standard form. An inscription in Aramaic dating back to the 4th century BCE was found in Sirkap, testifying to the presence of the Aramaic script in present-day Pakistan. According to Sir John Marshall, this seems to confirm that Kharoshthi was later developed from Aramaic.

While the Brahmi script remained in use for centuries, Kharosthi seems to have been abandoned after the 2nd–3rd century AD. Because of the substantial differences between the Semitic-derived Kharosthi script and its successors, knowledge of Kharosthi may have declined rapidly once the script was supplanted by Brahmi-derived scripts, until its re-discovery by Western scholars in the 19th century.

The Kharosthi script was deciphered separately almost concomitantly by James Prinsep (in 1835, published in the &quot;Journal of the Asiatic society of Bengal&quot;, India) and by Carl Ludwig Grotefend (in 1836, published in &quot;Blätter für Münzkunde&quot;, Germany), with Grotefend &quot;evidently not aware&quot; of Prinsep&#x27;s article, followed by Christian Lassen (1838). They all used the bilingual coins of the Indo-Greek Kingdom (obverse in Greek, reverse in Pali, using the Kharosthi script). This in turn led to the reading of the Edicts of Ashoka, some of which were written in the Kharosthi script (the Major Rock Edicts at Mansehra and Shahbazgarhi).

The study of the Kharosthi script was recently invigorated by the discovery of the Gandhāran Buddhist texts, a set of birch bark manuscripts written in Kharosthi, discovered near the Afghan city of Hadda just west of the Khyber Pass in Pakistan. The manuscripts were donated to the British Library in 1994. The entire set of British Library manuscripts are dated to the 1st century CE, although other collections from different institutions contain Kharosthi manuscripts from 1st century BCE to 3rd century CE, making them the oldest Buddhist manuscripts yet discovered.

==Alphabet==

Kharosthi is mostly written right to left. Some variations in both the number and order of syllables occur in extant texts.

The Kharosthi alphabet is also known as the arapacana alphabet, and follows the order.

:&quot;a ra pa ca na&quot;
:&quot;la da ba ḍa ṣa&quot;
:&quot;va ta ya ṣṭa&quot;
:&quot;ka sa ma ga stha&quot;
:&quot;ja śva dha śa kha&quot;
:&quot;kṣa sta jñā rtha (&quot;or&quot; ha)&quot;
:&quot;bha cha sma hva tsa&quot;
:&quot;gha ṭha ṇa pha ska&quot;
:&quot;ysa śca ṭa ḍha&quot;

This alphabet was used in Gandharan Buddhism as a mnemonic for the Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra, a series of verses on the nature of phenomena.

===Consonants===
A bar above a consonant can be used to indicate various modified pronunciations depending on the consonant, such as nasalization or aspiration. It is used with k, ṣ, g, c, j, n, m, ś, ṣ, s, and h.

The &quot;cauda&quot; changes how consonants are pronounced in various ways, particularly fricativization. It is used with g, j, ḍ, t, d, p, y, v, ś, and s.

The dot below is used with m and h, but its precise phonetic function is unknown.

===Vowels and syllables===

Kharosthi includes only one standalone vowel character, which is used for initial vowels in words. Other initial vowels use the &quot;a&quot; character modified by diacritics. Each syllable includes the short /a/ sound by default, with other vowels being indicated by diacritic marks.

Long vowels are marked with the diacritic . An anusvara indicates nasalization of the vowel or a nasal segment following the vowel. A visarga indicates the unvoiced syllable-final /h/. It can also be used as a vowel length marker. A further diacritic, the &quot;double ring below&quot; appears with vowels -a and -u in some Central Asian documents, but its precise phonetic function is unknown.

Salomon has established that the vowel order is /a e i o u/, akin to Semitic scripts, rather than the usual vowel order for Indic scripts /a i u e o/. 


==Punctuation==

Nine Kharosthi punctuation marks have been identified:

==Numerals==
Kharosthi included a set of numerals that are reminiscent of Roman numerals and Psalter Pahlavi Numerals. The system is based on an additive and a multiplicative principle, but does not have the subtractive feature used in the Roman numeral system.
The numerals, like the letters, are written from right to left. There is no zero and no separate signs for the digits 5–9. Numbers are written additively, so, for example, the number 1996 would be written as .

==Unicode==

Kharosthi was added to the Unicode Standard in March, 2005 with the release of version 4.1.

The Unicode block for Kharosthi is U+10A00–U+10A5F:

<doc id="559440" wikidata="Q3098103" url="?curid=559440" title="Yonkers station">
<text>Yonkers station is a Metro-North Railroad and Amtrak railroad station located near Getty Square in Yonkers, New York. It is served by Metro-North Hudson Line commuter rail service and five Amtrak intercity services. The station building was constructed in 1911–1912, replacing an older structure.

==History==
The current station building was built in 1911 for the New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad (NYC) in the Beaux-Arts style. The architects were Warren and Wetmore, one of the firms responsible for Grand Central Terminal. It was meant to be a smaller version of Grand Central; Guastavino tiles are featured prominently in both stations.

Upon the merger of the NYC and the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968, the station became a Penn Central commuter rail station. By this time, intercity service to Yonkers had ended. Penn Central continued operating commuter travel until 1976, when it was taken over by Conrail, which in turn transferred the service to Metro-North in 1983. Intercity service returned to Yonkers in 1989 after a two-decade absence in an effort to revitalize the Saw Mill riverfront. In 2004, Metro-North completed a $43 million restoration of the Yonkers station.

The ticket office at the station closed on July 7, 2010, so that passengers must now buy their tickets from vending machines at street level. A Metro-North Railroad Police substation is in the terminal on the ground floor.

Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Berkshire Flyer&quot; began running on July 8, 2022, providing direct service to on summer weekends.

==Station layout==
The station has two high-level island platforms, each 10 cars long, serving the four-track line. Metro-North trains use all four tracks, while Amtrak trains generally use the inner tracks.

<text>Paige Davis (born October 15, 1969) is an American television personality and actress.

She is best known as the host of the TLC home improvement reality television program &quot;Trading Spaces&quot; from 2001 until 2008, and hosted the morning talkshow &quot;Home and Family&quot; on Hallmark Channel in 2012. She returned as host of &quot;Trading Spaces&quot; when TLC revived the series in 2018.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Davis attended Charles H. Bird Elementary School in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, from first grade through part of fifth. She lived for a time in Louisville, Kentucky, and graduated from the Louisville Youth Performing Arts School. She graduated from the Meadows School of the Arts at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. While in college, her mother and stepfather moved to Pittsburgh.

Much of her training has been in musical theater as well as dancing, and she spent two-and-a-half years in the national touring company of the Broadway musical &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; playing the role of Babette the Feather Duster for her second year. During this period, she was sometimes credited as Mindy Paige Benson.

In Los Angeles, California, Davis also did numerous TV commercials and videos.

===&quot;Trading Spaces&quot;===
In 2001, Davis became the host of the TLC cable network&#x27;s redecorating television series &quot;Trading Spaces&quot;, replacing Alex McLeod. Also that year, Davis married actor Patrick Page, with whom she appeared in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (making her married name Mindy Paige Page). Davis and Page&#x27;s wedding was featured on the TLC series &quot;A Wedding Story&quot;.

TLC dropped Davis in January 2005, to revamp the show with a host-less format. There was some media speculation that TLC&#x27;s decision was in part motivated by Davis&#x27;s appearance in &quot;TV Guide&quot; &quot;wearing nothing but wallpaper&quot; and her performance of a striptease in a &quot;Broadway Bares/Equity Fights AIDS&quot; charity event. The &quot;New York Post&quot; had reported in its &quot;Page Six&quot; column that Davis exposed her thong and permitted onlookers to touch her body. Davis responded to the story on the TLC message boards, writing that she had been dressed &quot;...in a very modest, almost demure, yellow dress, cut to my sternum.&quot; She acknowledged that she had &quot;flip[ped] [her] skirt for a second&quot; and said that she &quot;kept all of [her] clothes on at all times.&quot; She went on to characterize the article as &quot;rumor and exaggeration&quot; in its description of the event. The &quot;Post&quot; responded after &quot;Star&quot; magazine published three pictures of the event in their July 2, 2004, issue, noting that the photos showed Davis in poses that appeared to confirm the &quot;Post&quot;&#x27;s version of the story. However, both Davis and the network insisted there was no connection between the controversies and the format change, which the network described as a decision to take the show &quot;in a new creative direction.&quot; Davis subsequently signed a multi-year agreement with television syndication company King World Productions/CBS to develop new scripted and reality programming, including a deal to co-star in a daytime television program with interior designer Nate Berkus, but nothing came to air.

TLC announced in November 2007, that Davis would return as host of &quot;Trading Spaces&quot; in January 2008, along with others formerly associated with the program. Reports on the announcement published in the &quot;New York Post&quot; and in Davis&#x27;s hometown paper &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, remarked on the earlier &quot;bad press&quot; in 2005, with the &quot;Post&quot; commenting, &quot;Apparently, that &#x27;new creative direction&#x27; has done an about-face,&quot; and the &quot;Inquirer&quot; quoting a network vice president who &quot;doesn&#x27;t know the specifics behind the perky Davis&#x27;s firing, but called it &#x27;shortsightedness.&#x27;&quot;

Davis hosts new segments and interviews in &quot;The Best Of Trading Spaces&quot;, which debuted in January 2011, on TLC&#x27;s sister channel OWN.

&quot;Good Morning America&quot; announced on July 19, 2017, that Davis would be returning to the &quot;Trading Spaces&quot; reboot to serve as host. It premiered on April 7, 2018.

===Other television work===
Davis made other television appearances during and after her hosting duties. In 2004, she was a guest judge on the Food Network&#x27;s &quot;Iron Chef America&quot; in &quot;Battle Egg.&quot; She also was a contestant on the summer 2006 CBS television series &quot;Gameshow Marathon&quot;, in which celebrities participated in recreations of classic game shows with their winnings going to charity.

Appearing on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; on January 24, 2008, Davis shared with the audience her excitement about returning to &quot;Trading Spaces&quot;. She praised the new TLC executive team and its intention to keep &quot;Trading Spaces&quot; fresh, while at the same time maintaining the original mission of the show.

Davis joined the home improvement series &quot;Home Made Simple&quot; as host in October 2011.

===Theater===
During her initial run on &quot;Trading Spaces&quot;, Davis played the role of Roxie Hart in the musical &quot;Chicago&quot; on Broadway, and wrote the book &quot;Paige by Paige&quot; (), chronicling her television experiences. It spent numerous weeks on the New York Times Best Seller list. By 2007, Davis had created a cabaret act, Taking A Chance, described as &quot;chronicl[ing] how the choices Davis has made have informed her life&#x27;s loves&quot;. In mid-2007 she took over the title role in the national touring production of the Broadway revival &quot;Sweet Charity&quot;, replacing Molly Ringwald through the end of the show&#x27;s scheduled run on August 12, 2007.

In 2008 and 2009 Davis played &quot;Gloria&quot; in the Broadway revival of &quot;Boeing-Boeing&quot;.

In 2014, Davis premiered the role of &quot;Senga Quinn&quot; in Mark St. Germain&#x27;s Dancing Lessons at Barrington Stage. Don Aucoin of The Boston Globe praised the performance as providing &quot;the emotional depth and nuance of personality that can only be achieved by an actress who understands her character inside and out.&quot;

In 2017, Davis played the title role in &quot;Miss Abigail&#x27;s Guide to Dating, Mating, &amp; Marriage&quot;, an interactive theatre play, for the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera. In 2018, she is playing the title character in MAME at North Shore Music Theater in Massachusetts.

On February 8, 2022, Davis was announced in the title role of Pioneer Theatre Company&#x27;s upcoming production of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; Artistic Director Karen Azenberg will direct and choreograph the production at the Salt Lake City professional regional theatre. The production will run May 13 to May 28, 2022.

===Commercial endorsements===
Davis was a spokesperson for RC Willey Home Furnishings, a subsidiary of Berkshire-Hathaway, with locations in Utah, Idaho, Nevada, and California, however, upon her return to Trading Spaces in 2018, Davis gave up her affiliation with them.

In September 2008, Eastman Kodak Company formed a U.S. partnership with &quot;Trading Spaces&quot; and with Davis to encourage people to explore their creativity with their photos. Davis became Kodak&#x27;s celebrity spokesperson with the media through March 2009, sharing Kodak-inspired projects and ideas in the weekly design show, 30-second TV spots, on-line tips, videos, and a custom-published magazine.

<text>The Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren (C199 / R199 / Z199) is a grand tourer jointly developed by German automotive manufacturer Mercedes-Benz and British automobile manufacturer McLaren Automotive and sold from 2003 to 2010. When the car was developed, Mercedes-Benz owned 40 percent of the McLaren Group and the car was produced in conjunction between the two companies. The &quot;SLR&quot; name is an abbreviation for &quot;Sport Leicht Rennsport&quot; (Sport Light Racing), and was a homage to the Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR which served as the car&#x27;s inspiration. The car was offered in coupé, roadster and speedster bodystyles, with the latter being a limited edition model.

==History==

At the 1999 North American International Auto Show, Mercedes-Benz presented their Vision SLR concept, inspired both by the Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR &quot;Uhlenhaut Coupé&quot; of 1955, which was a modified Mercedes-Benz W196S race car, and the design of closed-wheel Formula One cars, a field in which they had prior experience from Mercedes-Benz competing in Formula One in the past as constructor also winning back to back championships in their debut season 1954 then 1955. Also during the jointly developed project of Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren in 2003 Mercedes-Benz acquiring 40 per cent ownership of McLaren Group competed in Formula One as partnership with the McLaren Formula One Team, and were developing powertrains and electronics for McLaren&#x27;s Formula One cars. The car was presented as &quot;Tomorrow Silver Arrow&quot; in a clear reference to the Silver Arrows of the golden age of Mercedes in competition during the fifties. Later that year, during the Frankfurt Motor Show, a roadster version of the SLR concept was presented. The concept car was fitted with a 5.0-litre supercharged AMG V8 engine able to generate a power output of and of torque at 4,000 rpm, mated to a 5-speed automatic gearbox with Touchshift control.

Wanting to bring the concept to production following its positive reception, Mercedes joined forces with their Formula One partner, McLaren, thus creating the Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren. Mercedes did the styling on the car while McLaren was fully responsible for everything else, from the design and the engineering to the manufacture and the testing of each car at the production line. The production version of the car was unveiled to the general public on 17 November 2003 having some major design adjustments in respect of the initial design. In order to give the car the performance that Mercedes wanted, McLaren had to radically alter the concept for better weight distribution, including moving the engine almost a meter back and lowering the fuel tank. Smaller adjustments included more complex vents on both sides of the car, a redesigned front with the three pointed star plunged in the nose and red tinted rear lights.

The Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren saw a production run of over six years. On 4 April 2008, Mercedes announced it would discontinue the SLR. The last of the coupés rolled off the production line at the end of 2010 and the roadster version was dropped in early 2009.
Due to the automatic gear box, front mid-engine arrangement, and its driving characteristics, some automotive journalists classify the SLR McLaren as a grand tourer.

When the car was still in prototype status, Mercedes used two bodies from the TVR Cerbera.

==Technical highlights==
===Brakes===

The SLR features Sensotronic Brake Control, a type of brake-by-wire system. The brake discs are carbon-ceramic units and provide better stopping power and fade resistance than steel discs when operating under ideal working temperature. Mercedes-Benz claims these discs are fade resistant to . The front discs are internally vented and measure in diameter; eight-piston callipers are used. Rear discs are in diameter with four-piston callipers. During wet conditions the callipers automatically skim the surface of the discs to keep them dry.

===Aerodynamics===

The SLR features active aerodynamics; there is a spoiler mounted on the rear integral air brake flap. The spoiler increases downforce depending on its angle of elevation (angle of attack). At a set speed, the spoiler/brake automatically raises to 10 degrees (15 degrees in the 722 edition), when demanded via the driver&#x27;s switch, the elevation can be increased to 30 degrees (35 degrees in the 722 edition) for increased rear downforce, at the cost of increased steady state drag. The car has a flat underbody and a rear diffuser for improved downforce. Due to this, there was no other place for the exhaust pipes to exit, other than the sides of the car, making it another unique feature of the SLR.

===Engine===

The SLR has a hand-built supercharged all-aluminium alloy, SOHC 3 valves per cylinder 90° V8 engine, with a bore and stroke of and with a compression ratio of 8.8:1. The engine is lubricated via a dry sump system. The Lysholm-type twin-screw supercharger rotates at a maximum of 23,000 rpm and produces of boost. The compressed air is then cooled via two intercoolers. The engine generates a maximum power output of at 6,500 rpm and maximum torque of between 3,250 and 5,000 rpm.

McLaren took the original concept car designed by Mercedes and moved the engine behind the front bumper, around behind the front axle. They also optimised the design of the centre firewall.

===Transmission===

The SLR uses the AMG SPEEDSHIFT R five-speed automatic transmission with three manual modes. For durability, Mercedes selected a five-speed transmission rather than their seven-speed transmission which was more complex and used more parts.

===Performance===
The car uses carbon-fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) construction in an attempt to keep the weight low. Despite CFRP materials, the total curb weight is . The SLR could attain a top speed of .

* &quot;Car and Driver&quot; achieved a 0 to acceleration time of 3.4 seconds, and a  time of 11.2 seconds at . &quot;Car and Driver&quot; also achieved top gear acceleration and times of 1.7 and 2.4 seconds, which are the fastest ever recorded by the magazine in a production car. The SLR also pulled 0.97 g on the skidpad. The magazine suggested that the times may be even lower if temperatures were lower.
* &quot;Motor Trend&quot; tested the SLR and achieved a 0- acceleration time of 3.3 seconds in April 2006.

&quot;Road And Track&quot; tested the car in their July 2005 Road Test and reached from a standstill in 3.5 seconds. The 0 to sprint was achieved in 7.5 seconds and a run was completed in 11.5 seconds at .

==Variants==
===722 Edition===

A new version of the SLR was introduced in 2006, called the Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren 722 Edition. The &quot;722&quot; refers to the victory by Stirling Moss and his co-driver Denis Jenkinson in a Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR with the starting number 722 (indicating a start time of 7:22 a.m.) at the Mille Miglia in 1955.

The &quot;722 Edition&quot; includes a modified version of the engine used in the SLR generating a power output of at 6,500 rpm and at 4,000 rpm. 19-inch light-alloy wheels were used to reduce unsprung mass, while modifications were also made to the suspension, with a stiffer damper setup and lower ride height introduced for improved handling. Larger diameter front brakes and a revised front air dam and rear diffuser were fitted.

Other exterior changes include red &quot;722&quot; badging, harking back to the original 722 racer, black tinted tail lights and headlamps. The interior has carbon fibre trim and black leather upholstery combined with Alcantara.

The SLR 722 can accelerate from 0 to in 3.6 seconds, 0 to in 10.2 seconds and in 27.6 seconds, and can attain a top speed of , faster than the standard Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren. Production of the 722 Edition was limited to 150 units.

===Roadster===

A roadster version of the SLR went on sale in September 2007. It uses the same engine as its coupé sibling, generating a power output of , to propel it to a top speed of and a 0 to acceleration time of 3.6 seconds.

However, as a convertible, the roadster was burdened with extra weight, which affected performance and handling. The Roadster&#x27;s roof is made from a &quot;newly developed material&quot; and does not take the form of a folding metal arrangement, as is common on many modern cars. Following a manual unlatching, it takes ten seconds to fold away electrically. According to an official Mercedes document, the cabin of the roadster is capable of allowing conversation between driver and passenger up to a speed of with the roof retracted. The SLR Roadster was aimed to compete against other luxurious sports cars such as the Pagani Zonda F Roadster.

===Roadster 722 S (2009)===

The Roadster variant of the 722 Edition was unveiled at the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show. The roadster has the same engine and suspension setup as the coupé along with the folding roof mechanism shared with the standard SLR roadster. It can accelerate to from standstill in 3.1 seconds and has top speed of .
The model went on sale in January 2009 and production was limited to 150 units.
===722 GT (2007)===

The 722 GT is a racing version of the SLR 722 which was developed for a one-make racing series called the SLR Club. The cars were built by Ray Mallock Ltd. following requests from enthusiasts with approval from Mercedes-Benz. The car has new wider bodywork to accommodate OZ racing wheels. The front grill vents are removed and larger, free flowing air extractors sit on the hood and flank the side of the car. The rear now has a fixed racing wing and diffuser.

Under the body, the car has shed of weight and reduced its dry weight to . The engine remains in relatively stock specification but now generates a power output of and of torque at 1.75 bar (175 kPa) of boost and is equipped with a new racing filter and exhaust system. The car has a modified Eibach racing suspension with a modified stabiliser at the front that improves handling. An adjustable wheel camber along with shock absorbers with variable compression and rebound settings allows the suspension setup to be configured for different race tracks. New 18-inch OZ racing wheels with central locking nuts allow for faster tyre changes while a pneumatic jack system aids further in the process. The stock carbon ceramic braking system has been replaced with an FIA approved racing brake system with steel brake discs having a modified cooling system and balance that ensure improved stopping power. The transmission from the standard car is retained but is now configured for race use.

Inside, the car is stripped out with only the essential functions being available, controlled from a carbon fibre binnacle. The stock steering wheel has been replaced with a racing steering wheel with paddle shifters and a gear change indicator, the heated leather seats have also been removed in favour of Recaro racing bucket seats with six-point racing harness and the gauges have been replaced with a digital racing display. New carbon fibre door panels, plexiglass windows and a full roll cage complete the transformation. Production was limited to just 21 units.

The 722 GT could accelerate from in 3.3 seconds and could attain a top speed of , which is less than the standard SLR due to added aerodynamic drag.

The SLR McLaren 722 GT was available to the North American market exclusively through their dealerships by Renntech.

=== Crown Edition (2008) ===
The SLR &quot;Crown Edition&quot; was commissioned by the King of Bahrain as gifts for fellow Arab royals. This run of 10 cars was upgraded with 722-specification parts, including the uprated and modified engine, carbon fibre aerodynamic parts, stiffer dampers and 19-inch lightweight alloy wheels. 

===Stirling Moss (2009)===

Named after the British racing driver of the same name, the SLR Stirling Moss is a limited edition variant unveiled at the 2009 North American International Auto Show, which uses a speedster styling that does not include a roof or a windscreen. The car is designed by Korean designer Yoon Il-hun and is inspired by the 300 SLR race car. The interior was designed by Dutch designer Sarkis Benliyan. The SLR Stirling Moss was to be the last series of the McLaren SLR built under the partnership between Mercedes-Benz and McLaren, until McLaren announced their own final Edition of the SLR in late 2010.

The supercharged 5.4-litre SLR AMG V8 engine is rated at . The SLR Stirling Moss could attain a top speed of with acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) achieved in 3 seconds. The car is approximately lighter than the regular model due to carbon fibre construction and speedster styling.

The SLR Stirling Moss began production in June 2009, after the SLR Roadster was discontinued in May 2009. All 75 cars planned to be produced were completed by December 2009. The SLR Stirling Moss was available only to the existing SLR owners and each car cost in excess of US$1 million.

===McLaren Edition (2011–2013)===

In December 2011, more than a year after the SLR was officially discontinued, McLaren Special Operations (MSO) announced a bespoke program for the SLR. The McLaren Edition is based on all variants of the SLR with the exclusion of Stirling Moss and includes revised bodywork (front and rear bumper, grille, top shell, side grills, rear diffuser, wheels) and interior parts, along with upgraded steering and suspension components and a new titanium sports exhaust. The cars were modified exactly to the owner&#x27;s specifications and due to this no two cars are exact. The personalisation cost £150,000 and was offered for only 25 cars.

=== SLR by MSO (2021) ===
The SLR by MSO was announced in 2021 by McLaren Special Operations. The project was said to be inspired by collectors, who often owned 3 or more SLR&#x27;s, asking to send their cars back to MSO to receive upgrades or spec changes. In response to this, MSO launched the SLR by MSO program, allowing owners to upgrade their cars to the latest MSO technology, and to choose their own specs. The SLR by MSO upgrade cost £131,500 and features a unique front splitter that looks visually similar to the one found on the 722 edition. There is also a revised rear diffuser and floor pan that allows for a 2.5% reduction in drag. The SLR by MSO also features a unique, lighter 5 spoke wheel, improvements to the braking system, an exhaust system that is 30kg lighter, and improved suspension that has been lowered by 10mm. The upgrade also included the car being repainted and interior re-trimmed.

=== HDK (2022) ===
The Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren HDK (High Downforce Kit) was announced in December 2021 by McLaren Special Operations as a bespoke car, built as a road-going version of the SLR 722 GT. Changes from the SLR 722 GT include an upgraded steering system, trimmed interior from a regular SLR, side grills, rear diffuser, louvers, single-exit exhausts and a modified variant of the M155 V8 producing 690 PS (507 kW; 680 hp).

Reports suggest that 12 of these cars will be built with each one having unique touches catering to the owner&#x27;s specifications, costing $350,000.

==Sales==
Total sales were 615 units in 2005, 261 units in 2006, and 275 units in 2007, falling well below Mercedes-McLaren&#x27;s goal of selling 500 units annually.

When the SLR was first announced, Mercedes said total production would be limited to 3,500 units. 1,400 units had been sold by the end of 2007. The factory confirmed that production would halt at the end of 2010.

A total of 2,157 cars were produced.

<doc id="559469" wikidata="Q1417715" url="?curid=559469" title="Toyota Avalon">
<text>The is a full-size sedan manufactured by Toyota, as its largest front-wheel drive sedan; also its flagship in the United States, Canada, China and the Middle East. The Avalon was also manufactured in Australia from April 2000 until June 2005, when it was replaced in November 2006 by the Aurion. The first production Avalon was manufactured in September 1994 at the TMMK assembly line in Georgetown, Kentucky, where subsequent generations have been manufactured.

Toyota marketed the front-drive Avalon as a replacement for its rear-drive Cressida, a model discontinued for the American market in 1992. The Cressida was an upper-level, mid-size, rear-wheel drive sedan. The Avalon has at times overlapped Toyota&#x27;s models using the same platform, including the Camry V6 and the Lexus ES. The third-generation and subsequent generations was distinguished by offering extra legroom due to its extended-length chassis. From 2013, the Lexus ES was moved to the extended platform to match the Avalon.

As of 2013, the Avalon was sold in the United States, Canada, China, South Korea and the Middle East. It was discontinued in the United States in 2022.

Avalon is a legendary island of the Arthurian legend, fitting it in with Toyota&#x27;s tradition of naming their sedans after variants of the word for &quot;crown&quot; in various languages (Crown, Corona, Camry, Corolla), types of crowns (Tiara), or other aspects of royalty (Scepter).


== First generation (XX10; 1994) ==


The Avalon was a new model introduced in February 1994 at the Chicago International Auto Show and launched in late 1994 for the 1995 model year. Development began in 1990 under the 299T project code (ending in 1993), with the design phase concluding in 1991 with internal approval of the final design. Design patents were filed with the Japanese Patent Office on 17 February 1992, under patent number 0890183. Built in the same plant as the Camry, the Avalon was based on a stretched XV10 Camry platform featuring a 3.0-liter &quot;1MZ-FE&quot; V6 engine making and of torque. With almost of interior space, the Avalon was the roomiest six-passenger car from a Japanese manufacturer sold in America, despite being three inches shorter than the Mazda 929 and 11 inches shorter than the Dodge Intrepid. Its exterior dimensions were almost exactly the same as its perennial competitors, the Nissan Maxima, Mitsubishi Diamante and Mazda Millenia.

Toyota first introduced the &quot;Avalon&quot; name on a concept convertible sedan at the 1991 Tokyo Motor Show.

The Avalon was available with a front bench seat for six-passenger seating, and its column shifter was the first such feature in an American Toyota car since the T130 series Corona. The XL models were similar to the LE models of other Toyota vehicles, and the XLS models were similar to the XLE models of other Toyota vehicles. Traction control was optional. For 1997 models ABS became standard, power rating increased to , and torque increased to . In 1997 for the 1998 model year a mid-cycle refresh was introduced with minor updates to the front and rear fascias. Also for 1998, the Avalon&#x27;s structure was modified to improve safety while front seat-mounted side airbags became standard.

The first-generation Avalon was also sold in Japan (vehicles were made in the United States and exported to Japan) as a right-hand drive model, and was exclusive to &quot;Toyopet Store&quot; locations. In Japan, it was the largest front-wheel drive sedan at &quot;Toyopet Store&quot; locations, and was sold alongside the front-engine, rear-drive Toyota Celsior, and was available in 3.0 and 3.0 G grade levels, with the &quot;Coach Edition&quot; available as an option starting in late 1997 (equivalent to the 1998 model year). In Japan it was classified as a luxury car (and so carried an expensive, yearly road tax) because of Japanese government dimension regulations that placed it in the &quot;large car&quot; category and its, by Japanese standards, large engine displacement.

=== Australia (2000–2005) ===
In 1999, Toyota recycled the old tooling for the old Avalon by shipping it to Toyota Australia, and launched the old Avalon as an &quot;all-new&quot; model in June 2000. The new Australian Avalon had an identical body to the old 1994 Avalon. The Australian model was built at the Toyota Australia Altona Plant in Melbourne, made in both right-hand drive (for Australia, New Zealand, and some parts of Asia), as well as left-hand drive for the Middle East. The Camry was also made at this plant. The Avalon performed poorly in Australia; critics called the car &quot;boring&quot;, and sales were low. The Avalon was front-wheel drive and available only as a sedan with a 3.0-liter V6 and automatic transmission. By contrast, its intended rivals, the Ford Falcon and Holden Commodore, were rear-wheel drive and offered a wider range of body styles and engine/transmission options.

Toyota had originally decided to rename the Avalon as the Centaur for the Australian market, after the mythological creature of the same name. However, the Australian hospital ship AHS &quot;Centaur&quot; had been torpedoed and sunk by a Japanese submarine during World War II and when Toyota Australia was made aware of this prior to the release of the car, they organised for the Centaur badges to be destroyed and removed the offending nameplate from all paperwork and advertising. As a result, the original &quot;Avalon&quot; name prevailed for the Australian market.

When the Avalon was updated in 2001 as the &quot;Mark II&quot; (not to be confused with the separate Toyota Mark II), the model range was lightly revised and new hubcaps/alloy wheels were fitted. The &quot;Mark III&quot; designation refers to the 2003 to 2005 facelift models.

Many buyers preferred the V6-powered Camry instead of the Avalon. Further, the 2003 facelift failed to rectify the lower than expected sales, with many criticizing the new front styling. Because of these sales concerns, Toyota Australia marketed it towards taxi fleets, against the Ford Falcon, with a specially developed dual-fuel (LPG and gasoline)-compatible engine. Avalon production ceased in mid-2005. In November 2006, Toyota introduced its replacement, the Toyota Aurion (XV40).

;Pre-facelift
;Facelift
==== Toyota X-Runner Concept ====
At the 2003 Melbourne and Sydney International Motor Shows, Toyota Australia unveiled the X-Runner Concept, a coupe utility version of the Avalon. The suspension AWD parts were borrowed from the Lexus RX and the rear axle came from the Tarago van. It was intended for production, but Toyota of Australia could not get approval from the parent company.

== Second generation (XX20; 1999) ==

The second-generation Avalon grew larger in almost every respect, except wheelbase. It was still based on the stretched Camry platform and was powered by a 3.0-liter &quot;1MZ-FE&quot; V6 engine equipped with VVT-i, shared with the Toyota Camry, Toyota Highlander, Toyota Sienna, and the Lexus ES300, making and . of torque and paired to a 4-speed automatic. The coefficient of drag had been reduced to .

This Avalon was available in two trims: the basic XL and the upscale XLS. Standard features include electroluminescent &quot;Optitron&quot; gauges, 4-wheel disc ABS, front torso side airbags and 15&quot; alloy wheels. Optional were a JBL audio system, Vehicle Stability Control, and a front row bench seat, allowing up to six passengers—a characteristic of large sized cars. However, the front center seat is a tight fit for an adult passenger. Dual climate control, larger 16&quot; wheels, and driver&#x27;s and passenger&#x27;s power seats were also available.

This second-generation Avalon also featured a built-in 115 V AC power inverter, the first car with such a feature. This was dropped in the third-generation Avalon; yet, the Toyota Highlander, Matrix, Sienna, and Scion models now offer such an inverter.

The Avalon received a mid-cycle facelift for the 2003 model year, with a new grille and modified headlights and tail lights. The minor interior changes included an optional navigation system, woodgrain-style trimmed steering wheel for the XLS, slightly modified gauges, and a chrome emblem steering wheel added onto the XL (once only standard for the XLS).

The second-generation Avalon was also exported to the Japanese market as the , derived from the French word &quot;&quot; for &quot;extol&quot;, &quot;commend&quot;, or &quot;praise&quot;, between 2000 and 2004, replacing the first-generation sold as the Avalon. The Japanese Toyota Pronard was reassigned from &quot;Toyopet Store&quot; and was now exclusive to the former &quot;Vista Store&quot; network as &quot;Toyota Netz&quot; locations, slotted between the larger Toyota Aristo and smaller Verossa and Altezza. Some of the optional equipment installed in the Pronard, to enhance its luxury, was the TEMS ride control technology. Due to poor sales, Toyota did not export the third-generation Avalon to Japan; thus, the Toyota Pronard has been discontinued.

In the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) frontal crash test the Avalon received a &quot;Good&quot; overall score with the &quot;Good&quot; in all six measured categories.

Unlike the first-generation model, there was no Australian production or sales of this or later models.
== Third generation (XX30; 2004) ==

The Avalon underwent a redesign for 2005, and was unveiled to the public at the January 2005 North American International Auto Show. It went on sale in February 2005. Toyota reportedly cut the Avalon&#x27;s production development time down from 29.5 months to 18 months. The third generation Avalon was not sold in Europe or Japan.

The third generation Avalon was larger than previous versions, with Calty styling and ; the Avalon also became the first Toyota to use a single piece wiper blade design. The redesign dropped the front bench seat option, a feature once common among large American sedans such as Buicks and Cadillacs, and featured a semi-flat rear floor to help increase rear passenger comfort.

The Avalon was the first Toyota to use Dual VVT-i in the US market in an all-new 3.5-liter &quot;2GR-FE&quot; V6 engine which met ULEV certification and had a power output of with a 0–60 time of 6.0 seconds. The engine was mated to a 5-speed sequential shift automatic. Due to changes in the SAE&#x27;s testing procedures, power dropped to and torque dropped to for the 2006 model year. Actual power output did not change.

The Avalon came in four trims: the standard (base) XL, Touring, XLS, and Limited. The XL model included 16&quot; alloy wheels, while other trims came with larger 17&quot; wheels. Performance-oriented tires were fitted to the Touring and Limited trims.

The XL included dual-climate automatic temperature controls and steering wheel-mounted audio and climate controls. The Touring trim offered faux aluminum and all-black leather interior, a sport-tuned suspension, unique powder-coated gray wheels, and a trunk lip-mounted spoiler. The XLS introduced standard cargo nets, six-disc CD changer, a power sliding-glass moonroof, electrochromic auto dimming rear-view and driver&#x27;s side-view mirrors, four-way passenger power seat and a HomeLink transceiver. The high-end Limited trim offered air-ventilated seats with a power driver&#x27;s seat cushion length adjuster, Toyota&#x27;s Smart Key System with keyless push-button start and entry, a quieter acoustic windshield, rain-sensing windshield wipers, an upgraded 12-speaker JBL audio system, &quot;in-glass&quot; LED turn signals on the side mirrors and a wood-trimmed steering wheel and shift gear lever. A navigation system was optional for every trim level other than the XL version. The Avalon had a flat rear floor design and reclining rear seats. Vehicle Stability Control was optional on all trim levels. Other options included a keyless Remote Engine Start, glass breakage sensor, rear window power sunshade and, on Limited models, a Dynamic Laser Cruise Control system. HID lighting with auto-leveling was standard on Touring and Limited grades.

On 5 December 2011, Toyota announced that Toyota Avalons assembled in the US would be exported to South Korea and shipped from Port of Hueneme in Oxnard, California.

=== Yearly changes ===

* 2010, for the 2011 model year: The facelifted Avalon went on sale in April 2010, with revised styling and only two trim lines: a base Avalon model and a more upscale Limited trim. A backup camera became standard using either the rear view mirror or navigation screen for a display, and exterior side mirrors with integrated turn signals now folded in. The updated navigation system now had real-time traffic updates. Other changes included a redesigned instrument cluster and center console, new wood-style trim, new sheetmetal, and a different rear and front fascia design. The front and tail lights included LED piping, and fuel economy was slightly improved to an EPA-estimated 20/29/23 (city/highway/combined) mpg rating. The revised Avalon had a new brake-override control. It had an improved suspension system and a 12-speaker JBL Synthesis system which was only available on the Limited trim. 17&quot; wheels were also standard on both trims although the Limited model has 10 spokes. Other exterior differences on the Limited included HID projector headlamps.

The Avalon came standard with anti-lock brakes, electronic brakeforce distribution, brake assist, dual front airbags, front row side torso airbags, front and rear side curtain airbags, and a driver&#x27;s knee airbag. For 2009 models, Vehicle Stability Control and traction control became standard while active head restraints were added. In 2010, the Star Safety System was added for the 2011 model year.

The Avalon was subject to the 2009–11 Toyota vehicle recalls. 2011 and later model years come standard with a brake-override system.

The Avalon received a &quot;Good&quot; overall score in both the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) frontal offset and side impact tests. In 2009, with the new head restraints the IIHS awarded the Avalon its &quot;Top Safety Pick&quot; accolade.

A &quot;Good&quot; rating in IIHS the roof strength test IIHS earned the 2011 model year the organization&#x27;s &quot;Top Safety Pick 2010&quot; designation. The 2011 model year also received the &quot;Top Safety Pick 2011&quot; recommendation.

=== Reception ===
&quot;Car and Driver&quot;, which had called previous Avalons &quot;Japanese Buicks,&quot; rated it at the top of a group of large premium sedans in 2005. &quot;Edmunds.com&quot;, &quot;Motor Trend&quot; and &quot;Automobile Magazine&quot; also rated it top in their own comparisons. &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; rated the Avalon at the top of its tested group in the large and upscale category, scoring ahead of five other sedans in the January 2010 issue. In 2010, the 2011 model year Avalon competed against the Ford Taurus and received first place awards from &quot;Motor Trend&quot;.

== Fourth generation (XX40; 2012) ==

The redesigned Avalon was partially revealed at the New York International Auto Show in April 2012, to be based on the same platform as the Lexus ES. A new grille was part of the redesign with redesigned lights that were now similar to the Camry. The interior controls have tap touch technology instead of buttons.

In June 2012, Toyota announced the Avalon would offer a hybrid powertrain. The Avalon went on sale in the US at the beginning of December 2012. On October 1, 2013, Toyota Korea announced that the All New Avalon Limited will be sold in South Korea.

The &quot;Touring&quot; trim was also reintroduced for this facelift, this time as a more sporty variant of the top-of-the-line &quot;Limited&quot; trim.
== Fifth generation (XX50; 2018) ==

The fifth-generation Avalon debuted at the January 2018 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, and went on sale in the US in May 2018. It is built on GA-K platform shared with the XZ10 series Lexus ES. Four trim levels offered in North America are XLE, XSE, Touring and Limited, as well as XLE, XSE and Limited versions of the Avalon Hybrid. An optional adaptive suspension is found in the Touring trim.

Production and assembly of the fifth-generation Avalon is at both Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky (TMMK) plant in Georgetown, Kentucky, and Tianjin FAW Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. (TFTM) plant in Tianjin, China, from 2019 until 2022. In 2021, assembly of the Avalon for the Chinese market by Sichuan FAW Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. (SFTM) commenced.

Four engine choices, shared with the XV70 series Camry, are offered: a 2.0 L &quot;M20A-FKS&quot; I4 with (only available in China), a 2.5 L &quot;A25A-FKS&quot; inline-four with , a 3.5 L &quot;2GR-FKS&quot; V6 with , and a hybrid powertrain consisting of a 2.5 L &quot;A25A-FXS&quot; I4 coupled with a electric motor; combined power output is . The hybrid is set up similarly to the redesigned Camry hybrid with a NiMH battery pack, though unlike the Camry hybrid, a li-ion battery is not offered. The EPA rated the V6 at on city, on highway driving, and on combined cycle. The Avalon Hybrid is rated up to on city driving and on both highway driving and combined cycle.

=== Discontinuation of US production ===
On 4 August 2021, Toyota announced that it would end production of the Avalon in the US after the 2022 model year as the market shifts towards SUVs and electrification. The Avalon will be replaced by the S235 Crown crossover, marking the return of the Crown nameplate in North America after a 50-year absence. The Avalon remains in production in China, manufactured in its local facility.

=== Facelift (2022) ===
The facelifted Avalon for the Chinese market was launched on 28 March 2022, it retained the five trim levels from the pre-facelift model such as Progressive, Deluxe, XLE, Touring and Limited. It is the first time that the Avalon was not sold in North America and became a Chinese-exclusive model after it was replaced with the Crown.

=== Facelift (2024) ===
The second facelifted Avalon for the Chinese market was launched in July 2024.

=== Yearly changes ===
* 2019, for the 2020 model year: Toyota introduced the Avalon TRD alongside the Camry TRD. Based on the XSE trim, it uses the same &quot;2GR-FKS&quot; V6 engine with sportier suspensions and sport exhaust system only found on TRD models.
* 2020, for the 2021 model year: The Avalon will be available in the US with a four-cylinder AWD variant. This will be available only with the 2.5-liter engine mated to the automatic transmission. Also, the 2021 model year Avalon gets a standard Android Auto and the XSE Nightshade trim level with black wheels, accents and badges. For the hybrid, the nickel-metal hydride battery was replaced by more compact lithium-ion battery pack.

=== Safety ===
It is equipped with Toyota Safety Sense P (TSS-P). The IIHS awarded a &quot;Top Safety Pick+&quot; honor to the Avalon, with a &quot;Good&quot; rating in all categories except the passenger-side small overlap test, where it received an &quot;Acceptable&quot; rating. However, Avalons built after September 2018 get a “Good” rating in the passenger-side small overlap test.

In 2021, for the 2022 model year, this was upgraded to the Toyota Safety Sense 2.5+ (TSS-2.5+).

In the 1991 election, Windsor was first elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the Member for Tamworth. Windsor had originally sought National Party preselection for this seat, but allegations in regards to a drink-driving incident arose on the day of his preselection, and the National Party endorsed another candidate. In spite of the allegations, Windsor won as an independent candidate and held the seat for ten years. Windsor was one of the four independents who held the balance of power after Nick Greiner&#x27;s Liberal-National Coalition lost 10 seats, resulting in a hung parliament. His decision to support the incumbent Coalition government ensured a second term in government for Greiner. After an adverse ruling by the Independent Commission Against Corruption against Greiner for offering former minister Terry Metherell a patronage job, the Labor opposition tabled a motion of no confidence in the government. Windsor and the other three independents told Greiner that unless he resigned, they would withdraw their support from the government and support the no-confidence motion. Rather than face certain defeat in the House, Greiner resigned and was succeeded by John Fahey.

==Federal political career==
Windsor resigned from the state parliament in September 2001 in order to contest the federal seat of New England.

In the federal election held later that year, he defeated one-term National incumbent Stuart St. Clair. Windsor took a large lead on the first count, and defeated St. Clair on Labor and other party preferences. Windsor&#x27;s victory was considered a shock result, since the National Party and its predecessor, the Country Party, had held New England since 1922, usually without serious difficulty.

In September 2004, in an interview with Tony Vermeer from &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, Windsor was the centre of controversy over an alleged breach of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Windsor claimed that he had been approached, in May 2004, by a figure associated with the National Party with the offer of a diplomatic position in exchange for retiring from politics. Windsor made the allegations during the course of the 2004 federal election campaign, some five months after the incident allegedly occurred. The Australian Electoral Commission referred the matter to the Australian Federal Police (AFP). Windsor was comfortably re-elected in the October 2004 election, increasing his majority to 21 percent. A month later, speaking under parliamentary privilege, he said that National Party leader John Anderson and Senator Sandy Macdonald had made the offer through an intermediary, Tamworth businessman Greg McGuire. Windsor also claimed that the AFP had referred the matter to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions for determination. Anderson, Macdonald, and McGuire denied the claims. The AFP investigated Windsor&#x27;s claims and advised that the matter would not be prosecuted.

Windsor was comfortably re-elected in 2007, increasing his majority to 24 per cent.

===2010 federal election===
As one of the six crossbenchers elected to the House of Representatives at the 2010 election, Windsor was at the centre of negotiations to determine the government after both major parties failed to win a majority in their own right. Windsor, together with Rob Oakeshott and Bob Katter, initially resolved to form a bloc to assist negotiations with the major parties to form government. However, several days later, Windsor claimed it should not be assumed that the three rural independents would move together. In a press conference on 7 September 2010, Windsor revealed that he would support the incumbent Labor government during confidence motions and supply bills. Oakeshott also threw his support to the incumbent Labor government, handing Labor a second term.

It had been assumed that Windsor would support the Coalition due to his past membership of the National Party but on this Windsor made an analogy of him being an ex-smoker: &quot;I&#x27;ve never been in parliament as a National, I gave up smoking about the same time [and] I&#x27;ve rid myself of two cancers&quot;.

Windsor is known as the architect of the bill which became an amendment to the &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot; (EPBC Act) known as the water trigger. The new legislation forced the government through a process whereby actions by large coal mining developments, in particular coal seam gas, which may adversely affect groundwater in the area and thereby significantly affecting water resources, had to be assessed for environmental impact.

===2013 federal election===
On 26 June 2013 Windsor announced that he would not be contesting the 2013 election; partly due to an undisclosed medical condition.

===2016 federal election===
On 10 March 2016, Windsor announced his intention to contest his former seat of New England as an independent candidate at the 2016 election. Windsor faced incumbent Deputy Prime Minister of Australia and Leader of the National Party of Australia Barnaby Joyce at the 2016 election, who had won the seat upon Windsor&#x27;s retirement at the previous election. Seat-level polling in the seat of New England found Joyce and Windsor neck and neck. On election day, however, Windsor was convincingly defeated, taking 41 percent of the two-party vote. Joyce was able to win a majority on the primary vote, enough to retain the seat without the need for preferences.
Before his defeat at this election Windsor said, &quot;You haven&#x27;t seen the last of me&quot; and was asked if he would stand again if he did not win he answered, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t rule anything out.&quot;

==Political views==
In an interview published in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; following the 2010 federal election, it was reported that Windsor supports a rent resources tax, deep cuts to carbon emissions, and improved services to rural and regional areas such as Labor&#x27;s proposed National Broadband Network but wants to ensure the scheme is fully costed. The same article claimed that Windsor supports the Coalition&#x27;s position on water, and the Greens position on a universal dental scheme.

He has fought a long-standing battle protecting the interests of local landholders and farmers living on one of NSW&#x27;s richest agricultural regions, the Liverpool Plains, due to the impact of mining on underlying groundwater. The region is rich in coal deposits; mining companies, such as BHP and Whitehaven Coal, have sought to acquire land. Greens have campaigned alongside Windsor, against mining companies. During the 2010 federal election campaign, it was revealed that Windsor had sold his family farm at Werris Creek to a wholly owned subsidiary of Whitehaven Coal, and then leased the property back. The reported sale was for more than A$4.5 million. &quot;The Australian&quot; subsequently claimed that Windsor yielded a return about three times greater than other farmers who sold their properties to the same company in the previous 18 months.

Windsor was present at the February 2011 announcement by the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, on the proposed July 2012 introduction of a tax on carbon emissions, together with Greens senators Bob Brown and Christine Milne, the Minister for Climate Change, Greg Combet, and independent MP Rob Oakeshott. Windsor downplayed his presence at the announcement, stating, &quot;Please don&#x27;t construe from my presence here that I will be supporting anything.&quot; He was later reported as stating that he would not accept increased transport fuel costs for country people. He subsequently announced that he was supporting Gillard&#x27;s carbon policy, as a matter of principle, and stated: &quot;This is about the history of people, most of whom haven&#x27;t even been born yet. And if I&#x27;m sacked from politics because of that, well, I&#x27;ll remove myself with a smile on my face.&quot;

Tony Windsor called for a referendum on same-sex marriage back in 2013, saying that the issue should be removed from the hands of politicians.

He also endorsed a referendum on the death penalty in the 1990&#x27;s.

==After politics==
&quot;Tony Windsor – The Biography&quot; was published in 2014.

In October 2021 Windsor was named as an advisor for climate fund, Climate 200.

<doc id="559489" wikidata="Q2193330" url="?curid=559489" title="Red Line (Washington Metro)">
<text>The Red Line is a rapid transit line of the Washington Metro system, consisting of 27 stations in Montgomery County, Maryland, and Washington, D.C., in the United States. It is a primary line through downtown Washington and the oldest and busiest line in the system. It forms a long, narrow &quot;U,&quot; capped by its terminal stations at Shady Grove and Glenmont.

Trains run every 5 minutes during weekday rush hours, every 6 minutes during weekday off-peak hours and weekends, and every 10 minutes daily after 9:30pm.

The Red Line is the only line in the system that does not share its tracks with another Metrorail line. However, it operates parallel to CSX Transportation freight trains along the railroad&#x27;s Metropolitan Subdivision from the D.C. neighborhood of Brentwood north past Silver Spring, Maryland, and continuing through Twinbrook.

== History ==

=== Planning and construction ===
Planning for Metro began with the Mass Transportation Survey in 1955, which attempted to forecast freeway and mass transit systems sufficient to meet the needs of 1980. In 1959, the study&#x27;s final report recommended two rapid transit lines which anticipated subways in downtown Washington. Because the plan called for extensive freeway construction within the District of Columbia, alarmed residents lobbied for federal legislation creating a moratorium on freeway construction through July 1, 1962. The National Capital Transportation Agency&#x27;s 1962 &quot;Transportation in the National Capital Region&quot; report anticipated much of the present Red Line route, with the Red Line following the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad right-of-way between Silver Spring and Rockville instead of a direct route between Bethesda and Rockville.

With the formation of WMATA in October 1966, planning of the system shifted from federal hands to a regional body with representatives of the District, Maryland, and Virginia. Congressional route approval was no longer a key consideration. Instead, routes had to serve each suburban jurisdiction to assure that they would approve bond referendums to finance the system. Because the least expensive way to build into the suburbs was to use existing railroad right-of-ways, the Red Line took much of its present form, except that it continued to feature a further link between its two stems along the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad right-of-way. An early proposal from 1967 was more extensive then what was ultimately approved, with the Red Line&#x27;s western terminus being in Germantown instead of Shady Grove.

By 1969, WMATA had decided on the current routing and stations, except for the extension beyond Rockville to Shady Grove. Montgomery County officials opposed ending the Red Line in downtown Rockville, saying it would cause congestion in the area and use scarce vacant land for a storage yard. Metro decided to propose to extend the Red Line one more station to Shady Grove and the U.S. Department of Transportation conditionally approved funding for the extension on July 26, 1975.

Construction on the Red Line began with a groundbreaking ceremony at Judiciary Square on December 9, 1969. Construction proved difficult because the National Park Service prohibited a bridge across Rock Creek and required that the Red Line tunnel under that valley; the tunnel in turn caused both the Dupont Circle and Woodley Park stations to be built further underground. The Red Line was proposed to tunnel under Yuma Street from Connecticut Avenue to Wisconsin Avenue, but local residents sued and that court case delayed construction of the tunnel for two years, then WMATA finally won the right to build the tunnel there.

=== Operation and extension ===
Service on the Red Line (and the Metro as a whole) began on March 27, 1976, with operation between Farragut North and Rhode Island Avenue. Gallery Place&#x27;s opening was delayed due to a court order regarding lack of accessibility for all, but it opened in the middle of the line on December 15, 1976. The western end of the line was extended one station to Dupont Circle on January 17, 1977, three stations to Van Ness–UDC on December 5, 1981, five stations to Grosvenor–Strathmore on August 25, 1984, and four stations to Shady Grove on December 15, 1984. The eastern end was extended one station from Rhode Island Avenue-Brentwood to Brookland-CUA on February 3, 1978. The eastern end was extended three stations to Silver Spring on February 6, 1978—which added Maryland to the system for the first time — two stations to Wheaton on September 22, 1990, and one station to Glenmont on July 25, 1998, completing the line.

The only time the Red Line shared tracks with another line was from January 27, 1997, to September 17, 1999, when the Green Line Commuter Shortcut used Red Line tracks from Brookland–CUA to Farragut North. A short time after the Green Line branch north of Fort Totten opened in the early 1990s, the &quot;Green Line Commuter Shortcut&quot; began as a six-month experiment. Passengers could board the Green Line between Greenbelt and West Hyattsville and travel as far as Farragut North without having to transfer; the trains bypassed Fort Totten via a single-track spur between the West Hyattsville and Brookland–CUA stations. Due to its success, the shortcut continued until the mid-city portion of the Green Line was completed in 1999.

The NoMa–Gallaudet University station (formerly New York Ave–Florida Ave–Gallaudet University), located between Union Station and Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood, opened on November 20, 2004. It was the system&#x27;s first infill station (i.e., a new station built between existing stations).

In November 2010, the WMATA authorized $37 million in capital improvements on the Red Line, a part of $212 million of work on the Red Line scheduled for 2010 to 2014.

In April 2012, a 1,200-car parking garage opened at the Glenmont station, joining the existing 1,700-car garage. Construction on the project, funded by the state of Maryland, began in December 2009.

From March 26, 2020, until June 28, 2020, trains were bypassing , , and stations due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. All stations were reopened beginning on June 28, 2020.

From September 11, 2021, to January 16, 2022, the Rockville and Shady Grove Metro stations were closed due to the Rockville Canopy Replacement Project.

On February 25, 2022, WMATA opened a new entrance on the east side of Rockville Pike and a new elevator and staircase to the platforms at the Medical Center station, eliminating the need for thousands of daily riders who emerge from the station on the west side of the Pike to cross the busy six-lane road to reach the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. In September 2009, Montgomery County applied for a $20 million federal grant, seeking to begin construction in 2011, but the project was not approved until 2013. Construction began in December 2017. The $68 million project, mostly funded by the Department of Defense, also includes new deep elevators, better surface bicycle, and pedestrian facilities, a pedestrian tunnel under Rockville Pike, and an extension of the left-turn lane on southbound MD 355 that opened in late 2021.

On June 1, 2024, stations north of Fort Totten were closed due to repairs and the construction of the new mezzanine under construction at Silver Spring station that will connect to the Purple Line. Takoma was reopened on June 28, while the others reopened on September 1.

In the summer of 2026, Medical Center and Bethesda stations will be closed due to construction of a new mezzanine at Bethesda that will connect to the Purple line and to Elm Street.

==Incidents and accidents==

=== 2004 Woodley Park accident ===

On November 3, 2004, an out-of-service Red Line train rolled backward into the Woodley Park station and hit an in-service train stopped at the platform. Twenty people were injured. A 14-month investigation concluded that the train operator was most likely not alert. Safety officials estimated that at least 79 would have died had the train been full. The train operator was fired and Metro officials agreed to add rollback protection to more than 300 rail cars.

=== 2009 train collision ===
On June 22, 2009, at 5:03 p.m., a six-car train collided with and telescoped onto a stationary train between the Takoma and Fort Totten Metro stations. Eight passengers and a train operator were killed in the collision and at least 70 people were injured. It is the deadliest accident in the history of the Washington Metro. The National Transportation Safety Board&#x27;s report of July 27, 2010, blamed the crash on a faulty track circuit, part of the automatic train control system. WMATA issued a list of planned changes.

=== Chronology ===
Dates on which portions of the Red Line opened for service.
==Route==

The Red Line begins above ground at Shady Grove, and parallels CSX Transportation&#x27;s Metropolitan Subdivision (served by MARC Brunswick Line trains) to south of Twinbrook. The route then enters a tunnel and curves west to run under Rockville Pike at North Bethesda. Until Tenleytown, the line follows the route of Rockville Pike and Wisconsin Avenue in a tunnel, except for a bridge over the Capital Beltway (I-495). The tunnel curves east at Tenleytown into Yuma Street to reach the Van Ness–UDC station, curving south there to travel under Connecticut Avenue through south of Farragut Square. A curve under Lafayette Park takes the tunnel east under G Street Northwest through the Metro Center and Gallery Place stations.

From Gallery Place through Judiciary Square, the line runs southeast, turning east again at D Street to reach Union Station. There it turns north and surfaces next to Union Station&#x27;s platforms, follows the Washington Terminal yard tracks north to Brentwood where the line turns northwestward and again joins CSX Transportation&#x27;s Metropolitan Subdivision tracks, running in a unique gauntlet arrangement with the freight railroad tracks straddling the Metro tracks. The Red Line continues in this manner northwest across the DC-Maryland line, through Takoma and past Silver Spring. It reenters a tunnel at 16th Street and heads north under Georgia Avenue to the end at Glenmont.

The Metropolitan Subdivision right-of-way were part of the former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad route to downtown Washington, D.C. The MARC commuter rail system uses this parallel route with stops in Silver Spring and Rockville when traveling between Washington and Martinsburg, West Virginia, while Amtrak uses this parallel route with a stop in Rockville when traveling the route between Miami and Chicago.

There is a maintenance yard between the NoMa–Gallaudet and Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood stops along with facilities just outside Shady Grove and Glenmont stops as well.

Internally, WMATA calls the Red Line the Shady Grove Route (A) and the Glenmont Route (B), which meet at Metro Center.

The Red Line needs 44 trains (10 eight-car trains and 34 six-car trains, consisting of 284 rail cars) to run at peak capacity.

The Red Line is one of two lines that do not enter Virginia, the other being the Green Line.

== Stations ==
The line serves the following stations, from northwest to northeast:
== Future ==
In November 2010, the WMATA authorized $37 million in capital improvements on the Red Line, a part of $212 million of work on the Red Line scheduled for 2010 to 2014.

In 2011, the WMATA examined the possibility of extending the Red Line past the Shady Grove station to the Metropolitan Grove station by 2040.

In April 2012, a 1,200-car parking garage opened at the Glenmont station, joining the existing 1,700-car garage. Construction on the project, funded by the state of Maryland, began in December 2009.

<doc id="559493" wikidata="Q254626" url="?curid=559493" title="Shilin District">
<text>Shilin District (also spelled Shihlin District, ) is a district of Taipei. The central command center of the Republic of China Navy (ROCN) is located in Shilin.

==History==
The name &quot;Shilin&quot; was derived from &quot;Pattsiran&quot;, the indigenous Ketagalan word for &quot;hot springs&quot;. It was then transliterated into Chinese as &quot;&quot; (), which has been written as &quot;Pat-chi-na&quot; or &quot;Pachina&quot;.

Prior to Han Chinese settlement, the area was home to the &quot;Kimassauw&quot; community () of the Taiwanese indigenous peoples. During the Qing era, a fort was set up, later called Zhilan Yi Bao (first fort/settlement of Pattsiran, ). By the late Qing dynasty, &quot;many literary talents from Shilin had passed the imperial examination&quot;, prompting the local gentry to rename it &quot;Shilin&quot; (), meaning &quot;congregation of scholars and talents&quot;.

In the 1920s under Japanese colonial rule, the area was organized as and in 1933 , under , Taihoku Prefecture. In 1945 after World War II, it was modified to Shilin Township (), Taipei County ().

Shilin is foremost a residential district and has several famous neighborhoods, such as Waishuangxi () and Tianmu. Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek lived in Shilin after moving the Chinese Nationalist government to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War. The district is divided up into 51 villages (), which are further divided up into 987 neighborhoods ().

The district can be said to be the origin of culture in Taipei. During the Qing Dynasty, many private, public and community schools were opened in the area. During the Japanese era, a national learning center was set up at Zhishanyan.

==Education==
Shilin has three universities: Ming Chuan University, Soochow University, and the Chinese Culture University. Several international schools, including the Taipei American School, Taipei Japanese School, The Primacy Collegiate Academy and Taipei European School are located in this district. The district is also home to two vocational colleges, four senior high schools, eight junior high schools, and twenty elementary schools.

The National Taiwan Science Education Center is also located in this district, along with the Taipei Astronomical Museum, the Shung Ye Museum of Formosan Aborigines, and the National Palace Museum.

==Institutions==
* Commercial Office of Brazil to Taipei
* Embassy of Eswatini in Taipei

==Tourism==
The district is home to many national historical sites, including historical temples, markets, and buildings. Tourist attractions include:
* Yangmingshan National Park
* Shihlin Paper Mill
* National Palace Museum
* Taipei Astronomical Museum
* National Taiwan Science Education Center

<text>Mulligatawny () is a soup which originated from Tamil cuisine. The name originates from the Tamil words ( &#x27;black pepper&#x27;), and (, &#x27;water&#x27;); literally, &quot;pepper-water&quot;. It is related to the dish .

Main ingredients commonly include chicken, mutton, and lentils.

==History==

Mulligatawny was popular in India by the end of the 18th century, and by the 19th century it began to appear in cookbooks of the day, with each cook (or cookbook) featuring its own recipe. Recipes for mulligatawny varied greatly at that time and over the years (e.g., Maria Rundell&#x27;s &quot;A New System of Domestic Cookery&quot; contained three versions), and later versions of the soup included British modifications that included meat, although the local Madras (modern Chennai) recipe on which it was based did not. Early references to it in English go back to 1784. In 1827, William Kitchiner wrote that it had become fashionable in Britain:

By the mid-1800s, Arthur Robert Kenney-Herbert (1840–1916), under the pen name Wyvern, wrote in his popular &quot;Culinary Jottings&quot; that &quot;really well-made &quot;mulligatunny&quot; is ... a thing of the past.&quot; He also noted that this simple recipe prepared by poorer natives of Madras as made by &quot;Mootoosamy&quot; was made by pounding:

== Ingredients ==
According to the &quot;Oxford Companion to Food&quot;, the simplest version of the soup included chicken or mutton, fried onion, and spices. More complex versions may call for &quot;a score of ingredients&quot;. Versions originating in southern India commonly called for lentils.

<text>Lindsay James Tanner (born 24 April 1956) is a former Australian politician. A member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), he represented the seat of Melbourne in the House of Representatives from 1993 to 2010 and served as Minister for Finance in the Rudd and Gillard governments from 2007 to 2010.

==Background==

Tanner was born in the East Gippsland town of Orbost. He studied at the local state primary school before obtaining a scholarship to Gippsland Grammar School in Sale, where he graduated as dux in 1973. He graduated from the University of Melbourne with a Bachelor of Laws with Honours and a Bachelor of Arts with Honours, and later a Master of Arts in history in 1981. While still at university, he co-wrote a book on environmental politics and worked as a casual layout and design artist. He was editor of &quot;Farrago&quot; and a member of the &quot;Melbourne University Law Review&quot;.

Tanner began his career as an articled clerk and solicitor at Holding Redlich Lawyers in Melbourne. In 1985, he became an electorate assistant to Labor senator Barney Cooney. He was Assistant State Secretary of the Federated Clerks&#x27; Union from 1987, then State Secretary from 1988 until 1993.

==Parliamentary career==
In March 1993 Tanner was elected to the Australian House of Representatives representing the Division of Melbourne, and served one term as a government backbencher during Paul Keating&#x27;s final term as prime minister.

The Liberal Party under John Howard won the March 1996 election, and Keating subsequently retired from politics. A major reshuffle by new leader Kim Beazley resulted in Tanner&#x27;s promotion to the Shadow Ministry and appointment as Shadow Minister for Transport. He remained a member of the Shadow Ministry, despite numerous changes of leadership, continuously until the election of the Rudd Labor government in November 2007.
Tanner himself had been touted as a potential leader but he never stood for the leadership.

In 1998, Tanner was moved to the portfolios of Finance and Consumer Affairs. In 1999, he wrote a book entitled &quot;Open Australia&quot;, which explored how information technology could be used to enhance social justice and economic equality; and he also wrote a number of articles on targeted, &quot;micro&quot; ways of addressing globalisation and the decline of large-scale manufacturing, in which he suggested there was little substance to the notion put forward by neoclassical economists of a &quot;simulated free market&quot; in East Asian economies that explains their &quot;emergence&quot; (see 1997 Asian Financial Crisis). Following the 2001 election, he became Shadow Minister for Communications.

Tanner has been a prominent member of Labor&#x27;s left faction and it was thought that he might contest the Labor leadership in 2003, when former leader Kim Beazley first challenged Simon Crean. In the second leadership spill in December 2003, Tanner supported Beazley, who lost the party-room ballot to Mark Latham. The following month, Latham appointed Tanner to the new portfolio of Community Relationships, in addition to his existing responsibilities.

After the October 2004 federal election, Tanner was thought to be a candidate for the position of Shadow Treasurer, which had been vacated by Simon Crean. However, once it became clear that Latham did not intend to offer him this position, Tanner announced that he would not stand for a position in the new shadow ministry. He subsequently released a brief statement, stating that he had &quot;no complaint about how Mark Latham has dealt with [him] personally&quot;, but adding that he had &quot;serious reservations about the emerging Labor response to our latest election defeat.&quot; In June 2005, Tanner was re-elected to the Opposition frontbench and was appointed Shadow Minister for Finance.

The 2007 election saw Tanner&#x27;s seat of Melbourne face The Greens on the two-party-preferred vote, the first seat to do so at a federal election. Labor retained the seat on 54.7 percent of the two-party-preferred vote. After the successful election of the federal Labor Party, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd retained Tanner as Minister for Finance and Deregulation. The role had previously only been known as Minister for Finance and Administration.

On 24 June 2010, during Julia Gillard&#x27;s first question time as prime minister, Tanner announced his intention to not re-contest his seat at the next election, citing that he wanted to spend more time at home with his family and stressing he had already planned to do so before the change in leadership.

His tenure as Member for Melbourne ceased on 19 July 2010 when the House of Representatives was dissolved prior to the 2010 federal election. He remained as Minister for Finance throughout the election campaign.

==Post-political career==
Tanner has been appointed as a Vice Chancellor&#x27;s Fellow and adjunct professor at Victoria University, and a special adviser to financial firm Lazard Australia. In 2011, the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS) accorded him the rare distinction of an Honorary Fellowship (FCIPS), the first to be bestowed outside of the UK.

Tanner was elected to the position of Chairman of the Essendon Football Club on 14 December 2015. Tanner is a long-standing supporter of the Bombers and was elected to the Board only 8 months earlier.

In 2016, Tanner joined the Investment Advisory Committee of Six Park, a Melbourne-based automated investment company offering financial advice and management.

On 15 November 2017 it was announced that Tanner was to be appointed a Non-Executive Director of Suncorp Group, effective 1 January 2017.

==Personal life==
He has been married three times, and has one son and three daughters.

<doc id="559513" wikidata="Q375237" url="?curid=559513" title="Parinirvana">
<text>In Buddhism, parinirvana (Sanskrit: &#x27;; [[Pali language|Pali]]:&#x27;) describes the state entered after death by someone who has attained &quot;nirvana&quot; during their lifetime. It implies a release from &quot;&quot;, karma and rebirth as well as the dissolution of the &quot;skandhas&quot;.

In some Mahāyāna scriptures, notably the &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot;, &quot;parinirvāṇa&quot; is described as the realm of the eternal true Self of the Buddha.

In the Buddha in art, the event is represented by a reclining Buddha figure, often surrounded by disciples.

==Final nirvana at death==
In the Buddhist view, when ordinary people die, each person&#x27;s unresolved karma passes on to a new birth; and thus the karmic inheritance is reborn in one of the Six Paths of &quot;samsara&quot;. However, when a person attains nirvana, they are liberated from karmic rebirth. When such a person dies, it is the end of the cycle of rebirth. Contemporary scholar Rupert Gethin explains:
==Parinirvana of Buddha Shakyamuni==
Accounts of the purported events surrounding the Buddha&#x27;s own parinirvāṇa are found in a wide range of Buddhist canonical literature. In addition to the Pāli Mahāparinibbāna sutta (DN 16) and its Sanskrit parallels, the topic is treated in the &quot;Saṃyutta-nikāya&quot; (SN 6.15) and the several Sanskrit parallels (T99 p253c-254c), the Sanskrit-based &quot;Ekottara-āgama&quot; (T125 p750c), and other early sutras preserved in Chinese, as well as in most of the Vinayas preserved in Chinese of the early Buddhist schools such as the Sarvāstivādins and the Mahāsāṃghikas. The historical event of the Buddha&#x27;s parinirvāṇa is also described in a number of later works, such as the Sanskrit &quot;Buddhacarita&quot; and the &quot;Avadāna-śataka&quot;, and the Pāli &quot;Mahāvaṃsa&quot;.

According to Bareau, the oldest core components of all these accounts are just the account of the Buddha&#x27;s &quot;parinirvāṇa&quot; itself at Kuśinagara and the funerary rites following his death. He deems all other extended details to be later additions with little historical value.

===Within the Mahaparinibbana Sutta (Pali)===
The &quot;parinirvana&quot; of the Buddha is described in the &quot;Mahaparinibbana Sutta&quot;. Because of its attention to detail, this Theravada &quot;sutta&quot;, though first committed to writing hundreds of years after his death, has been resorted to as the principal source of reference in most standard studies of the Buddha&#x27;s life.

===Within the Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa sūtra===

In contrast to these works which deal with the Buddha&#x27;s &quot;parinirvāṇa&quot; as a biographical event, the &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa sūtra&quot; was written hundreds of years later. The Nirvana Sutra does not give details of the historical event of the day of the &quot;parinirvāṇa&quot; itself, except the Buddha&#x27;s illness and Cunda&#x27;s meal offering, nor any of the other preceding or subsequent incidents, instead using the event as merely a convenient springboard for the expression of standard Mahayana ideals such as the &quot;tathagata-garbha&quot;/&quot;buddha-dhatu&quot; doctrine, the eternality of the Buddha, and the soteriological fate of the &quot;icchantikas&quot; and so forth.

===Location of Gautama Buddha&#x27;s death and parinirvana===
It has been suggested by Waddell that the site of the death and &quot;parinirvana&quot; of Gautama Buddha was in the region of Rampurva: &quot;I believe that Kusīnagara, where the Buddha died may be ultimately found to the North of Bettiah, and in the line of the Aśōka pillars which lead hither from Patna (Pāțaliputra)&quot; in Bihar. It still awaits proper archaeological excavation.

==In Mahayana literature==
According to the &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot; (also called the &quot;Nirvana Sutra&quot;), the Buddha taught that &quot;parinirvāṇa&quot; is the realm of the Eternal, Bliss, the Self, and the Pure. Dr. Paul Williams states that it depicts the Buddha using the term &quot;Self&quot; in order to win over non-Buddhist ascetics. However, the &quot;Mahaparinirvana Sutra&quot; is a long and highly composite Mahayana scripture, and the part of the sutra upon which Williams is basing his statement is a portion of the Nirvana Sutra of secondary Central Asian provenance - other parts of the sutra were written in India.

Guang Xing speaks of how the Mahayanists of the &quot;Nirvana Sutra&quot; understand the &quot;mahaparinirvana&quot; to be the liberated Self of the eternal Buddha:
Only in Mahaparinirvana is this True Self held to be fully discernible and accessible.

Kosho Yamamoto cites a passage in which the Buddha admonishes his monks not to dwell inordinately on the idea of the non-Self but to meditate on the Self. Yamamoto writes:
Michael Zimmermann, in his study of the Tathagatagarbha Sutra, reveals that not only the &quot;Mahaparinirvana Sutra&quot; but also the &quot;Tathagatagarbha Sutra&quot; and the &quot;Lankavatara Sutra&quot; speak affirmatively of the Self. Zimmermann observes:

<text>William Andrew Murray Boyd (born 7 March 1952) is a British novelist, short story writer and screenwriter.

==Biography==
Boyd was born in Accra, Gold Coast (present-day Ghana), to Scottish parents, both from Fife, and has two younger sisters. His father Alexander, a doctor specialising in tropical medicine, and Boyd&#x27;s mother, who was a teacher, moved to the Gold Coast in 1950 to run the health clinic at the University College of the Gold Coast, Legon (now the University of Ghana). In the early 1960s, the family moved to western Nigeria, where Boyd&#x27;s father held a similar position at the University of Ibadan. Boyd spent his early life in Ghana and Nigeria and, at the age of nine, went to a preparatory school and then to Gordonstoun school in Scotland, and, after that, to the University of Nice in France, followed by the University of Glasgow, where he gained an M.A. (Hons) in English &amp; Philosophy, and finally Jesus College, Oxford. His father died of a rare disease when Boyd was 26.

Between 1980 and 1983, Boyd was a lecturer in English at St Hilda&#x27;s College, Oxford, and it was while he was there that his first novel, &quot;A Good Man in Africa&quot; (1981), was published. He was also a television critic for the &quot;New Statesman&quot; between 1981 and 1983.

Boyd was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2005 for services to literature. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and an Officier de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. He has been presented with honorary Doctorates in Literature from the universities of St. Andrews, Stirling, Glasgow, and Dundee and is an honorary fellow of Jesus College, Oxford. Boyd is a member of the Chelsea Arts Club.

Boyd met his wife Susan, a former editor and now a screenwriter, while they were both at Glasgow University. He has a house in Chelsea, London, and a farmhouse and vineyard (with its own appellation &quot;Château Pecachard&quot;) in Bergerac in the Dordogne in south-west France.

In August 2014, Boyd was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

==Work==
===Novels===
Boyd was selected in 1983 as one of the 20 &quot;Best of Young British Novelists&quot; in a promotion run by &quot;Granta&quot; magazine and the Book Marketing Council. Boyd&#x27;s novels include: &quot;A Good Man in Africa&quot;, a study of a disaster-prone British diplomat operating in West Africa, for which he won the Whitbread Book award and Somerset Maugham Award in 1981; &quot;An Ice-Cream War&quot;, set against the background of the World War I campaigns in colonial East Africa, which won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize for Fiction in 1982; &quot;Brazzaville Beach&quot;, published in 1991, which follows a scientist researching chimpanzee behaviour in Africa; and &quot;Any Human Heart&quot;, written in the form of the journals of a fictitious male 20th-century British writer, which won the Prix Jean Monnet de Littérature Européenne and was longlisted for the Booker Prize in 2002. &quot;Restless&quot;, the tale of a young woman who discovers that her mother had been recruited as a spy during World War II, was published in 2006 and won the Novel of the Year award in the 2006 Costa Book Awards. Boyd&#x27;s novel &quot;Waiting for Sunrise&quot; was published in 2012. Following &quot;Solo&quot; in 2013, &quot;Sweet Caress&quot; was published in 2015, the fourth novel Boyd has written from a woman&#x27;s viewpoint. His sixteenth novel, &quot;Trio&quot;, was published in 2020.

====&quot;Solo&quot;, the James Bond novel====
In April 2012, Ian Fleming&#x27;s estate announced that Boyd would write the next James Bond novel. The book, &quot;Solo&quot;, is set in 1969; it was published in the UK by Jonathan Cape in September 2013. Boyd used Bond creator Ian Fleming as a character in his novel &quot;Any Human Heart&quot;. Fleming recruits the book&#x27;s protagonist, Logan Mountstuart, to British Naval Intelligence during World War Two.

===Short stories===
Several collections of short stories by Boyd have been published, including &quot;On the Yankee Station&quot; (1981), &quot;The Destiny of Nathalie &#x27;X&#x27;&quot; (1995), &quot;Fascination&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Dreams of Bethany Mellmoth&quot; (2017). In his introduction to &quot;The Dream Lover&quot; (2008), Boyd says that he believes the short story form to have been key to his evolution as a writer.

===Screenplays===
As a screenwriter, Boyd has written several feature film and television productions. The feature films include: &quot;Scoop&quot; (1987), adapted from the Evelyn Waugh novel; &quot;Stars and Bars&quot; (1988), adapted from Boyd&#x27;s own novel; &quot;Mister Johnson&quot; (1990), based on the 1939 novel by Joyce Cary; &quot;Tune in Tomorrow&quot; (1990), based on the Mario Vargas Llosa novel &quot;Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter&quot;; &quot;A Good Man in Africa&quot; (1994), also adapted from his own novel; &quot;The Trench&quot; (1999) an independent war film which he also directed; &quot;Man to Man&quot; (2005), a historical drama which was nominated for a Golden Bear award at the Berlin International Film Festival; and &quot;Sword of Honour&quot;, based on the &quot;Sword of Honour&quot; trilogy of novels by Evelyn Waugh. He was one of several writers who worked on &quot;Chaplin&quot; (1992). His television screenwriting credits include: &quot;Good and Bad at Games&quot; (1983), adapted from Boyd&#x27;s short story about English public school life; &quot;Dutch Girls&quot; (1985); &quot;Armadillo&quot; (2001), adapted from his own novel; &quot;A Waste of Shame&quot; (2005) about Shakespeare&#x27;s composition of his sonnets; &quot;Any Human Heart&quot; (2010), adapted from Boyd&#x27;s own novel into a Channel 4 series starring Jim Broadbent, which won the 2011 Best Drama Serial BAFTA award; and &quot;Restless&quot; (2012), also adapted from his own novel. Boyd created the miniseries &quot;Spy City&quot; which aired in 2020.

===Plays===
Boyd adapted two Anton Chekhov short stories – &quot;A Visit to Friends&quot; and &quot;My Life (The Story of a Provincial)&quot; – to create the play &quot;Longing&quot;. Directed by Nina Raine and performed at London&#x27;s Hampstead Theatre, the play starred Jonathan Bailey, Tamsin Greig, Natasha Little, Eve Ponsonby, John Sessions and Catrin Stewart. Previews began on 28 February 2013; the press night was on 7 March 2013. Boyd, who was theatre critic for the University of Glasgow in the 1970s and has many actor friends, refers to his ambition to write a play as finally getting &quot;this monkey off my back&quot;. A further play by Boyd, &quot;The Argument&quot;, described as a Strindberg-like take on human dynamics, was performed at Hampstead Theatre Downstairs in March 2016. Both plays were published by Methuen Drama (see Bibliography).

===Non-fiction===
&quot;Protobiography&quot;, an autobiographical work by Boyd that recalls his early childhood, was published initially in 1998 by Bridgewater Press in a limited edition. A paperback edition was published in 2005 by Penguin Books. A collection of Boyd&#x27;s journalism and other non-fiction writing was published in 2005 as &quot;Bamboo&quot;.

==Nat Tate hoax==

In 1998, Boyd published &quot;Nat Tate: An American Artist 1928–1960&quot;, which presents the paintings and tragic biography of a supposed New York-based 1950s abstract expressionist painter named Nat Tate, who actually never existed and was, along with his paintings, a creation of Boyd&#x27;s. When the book was initially published, it was not revealed that it was a work of fiction, and some were duped by the hoax; it was launched at a lavish party, with excerpts read by David Bowie and Gore Vidal (both of whom were in on the joke), and a number of prominent members of the art world claimed to remember the artist. It caused quite a stir once the truth was revealed. The name &quot;Nat Tate&quot; is derived from the names of the two leading British art galleries: the National Gallery and the Tate Gallery. Boyd, who also paints, made artwork under the pseudonym of Nat Tate and sent it to auction, where it raised funds for an art charity. Nat Tate also appears in &quot;Any Human Heart&quot;, also by Boyd, with a wry footnote to the 1998 book.

<doc id="559536" wikidata="Q4715207" url="?curid=559536" title="Green Line (Washington Metro)">
<text>The Green Line is a rapid transit line of the Washington Metro system, consisting of 21 stations in Washington, D.C., and Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States. The Green Line runs from to , connecting the southeast suburbs to the northeast suburbs through downtown Washington, D.C. 

It was the last line in the original Metro plan to be constructed, with service beginning in 1991, and is one of three north–south lines through the city of Washington. The Green Line shares track with the Yellow Line from to . The fully completed line was opened for service on January 13, 2001, which concluded construction of the original Metrorail system.

On weekdays, trains run every six minutes until 9:30 p.m. and every 7.5 minutes afterward. On weekends, trains run every eight minutes.

== Planning ==
Planning for Metro began with the Mass Transportation Survey in 1955, which attempted to forecast both freeway and mass transit systems sufficient to meet the needs of the region projected for 1980. In 1959, the study&#x27;s final report included two rapid transit lines which anticipated subways in downtown Washington. Because the plan called for extensive freeway construction within the District of Columbia, alarmed residents lobbied for legislation which both created a new transportation agency and blocked freeway construction. The agency, the National Capital Transportation Administration, issued a 1962 &quot;Transportation in the National Capital Region&quot; report, which did not include the route that became the Green Line. A central route under 7th Street in downtown was only added in 1967 primarily to serve the &quot;inner city.&quot;

In March 1968, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) board approved its Adopted Regional System (ARS) which included the Green Line from Branch Avenue to Greenbelt. It also foresaw possible future extensions to Laurel, Maryland and Brandywine, Maryland.

=== Early decision making ===
Mid-century plans for rapid transit neglected some of the District&#x27;s less affluent neighborhoods. By late 1966, some plans started to include a line along 7th Street in the District of Columbia. In 1968, the new WMATA included the line in its master plan for its proposed system. At that time, a Green Line was planned to pass through some of the area&#x27;s poorest and most transit-dependent neighborhoods and provide them with subway service. Riots following the death of Martin Luther King in 1968 destroyed much of the commercial district around 14th and U Streets, and planners hoped that adding a subway stop in that area would stimulate redevelopment. The original 1969 plan called for a line under 13th Street NW with just two stations. However, in 1970, the District of Columbia Council agreed to pay an additional $3 million to add a third station and reroute the Green Line under U Street, and 14th Street NW. The southern part of the Green Line was originally planned to pass over the 11th Street Bridges to the intersection of Good Hope Road SE and Martin Luther King, Jr., Avenue SE, follow Martin Luther King, Jr., Avenue SE to Suitland Parkway, down Suitland Parkway to Branch Avenue SE, and down Branch Avenue to a terminus at the intersection of Branch Avenue and the Capital Beltway. Public hearings on whether to build a Green Line and the route it should take were completed in 1973, and portions of the line were originally scheduled to open in 1976. However, construction delays kept the first Green Line stations from opening until 1991.

The downtown segment of the line was originally projected to open in September 1977. Obtaining approval of the District of Columbia and Prince George&#x27;s County of the exact alignment of the Green Line north of U Street delayed construction. Originally, the ARS called for the line to be placed in the median strip of the planned North Central Freeway, but after that road was cancelled, the route of the replacement subway tunnel became controversial, resulting in years of expensive delays.

The tunnel between the and stations, including the junction with the future Yellow Line, was built at the same time as the other Metro tunnels in downtown Washington in the early 1970s. During construction under 7th Street and U Street, where the cut-and-cover technique was used, street traffic and pedestrian access on those streets was difficult. That led to the closure of the traditional retail businesses along the route.

The southern section of the line was not spared from issues, however. The site of Anacostia station, set for the intersection of Martin Luther King, Jr., Avenue SE and Good Hope Road SE, led to concerns that the station would destroy historic Old Anacostia, and after pressure from the federal government, Metro moved the site of the station to Howard Road SE.

By late 1977, Metro had pushed the opening of the Green Line to June 1983. Increasing construction costs and financing problems (caused primarily by the inability of local governments to contribute their share of Metro&#x27;s funding) led WMATA to consider shifting the Green Line to a more southerly route, along Wheeler Road SE, to terminate near Rosecroft Raceway. Another alternative would have built two Green Lines, one following Wheeler Road SE with a terminus at Southern Avenue and the other following Suitland Parkway to Martin Luther King, Jr., Avenue SE, proceeding northerly along Martin Luther King, Jr., Avenue SE to Good Hope Road SE, and terminating at Good Hope Road SE and SE (then called &quot;Anacostia Station&quot;).

In October 1977, WMATA&#x27;s Board of Directors refused to declare construction of the Green Line a &quot;high priority&quot; (favoring extension of the Red Line to ) although it instructed Metro staff to work on plans to fund the line and to determine its route. Although the United States Department of Transportation approved the Glenmont extension, federal officials were unhappy that Metro had yet to construct the Green Line into Anacostia.

In January 1978, a WMATA regional task force approved a Green Line route in Anacostia that followed Martin Luther King, Jr., Avenue and then Wheeler Road down to the Beltway, with a new station added near St. Elizabeths Hospital. Nonetheless, the Prince George&#x27;s County government successfully demanded in May 1978 for WMATA to choose the Suitland Parkway to Rosecroft route instead. In August 1978, WMATA&#x27;s Board of Directors recommended to the federal government and its partner state and local governments for the entire -long Metrorail system to be fully built, a proposal that included immediate construction of the , , , and stations. WMATA announced in November 1978 that it had secured funding to build the Green Line from Gallery Place to Waterfront and that construction was nearly complete on that portion of the line, but that funding did not exist to push the line from Waterfront to Anacostia. Nonetheless, Metro reiterated that it intended to complete the extension by late 1983.

Two additional realignments occurred at the north end of the Green Line but with less acrimony. North of , the line was to have surfaced in the median of the planned North Central Freeway, I-95, and to have proceeded to a point just west of , with an intermediate station at Chillum. I-95 and Metro would have run through the Northwest Branch Stream Valley Park, but the cancellation of I-95 through the District and out to the Beltway in 1974 meant that it was no longer necessary or appropriate to condemn an I-95-sized swath of parkland just for Metro. WMATA eventually selected a new route that skirted most of the park, and it was federally approved by the mid-1980s. The planned Chillum station was relocated and named . The other alignment dispute occurred in the Petworth section of Washington and involved whether the tunnel would go under or skirt Rock Creek Cemetery and how to go through its soft-soil burial ground (i) and the least disruptive way under New Hampshire Avenue from to . The tunnels eventually skirted the cemetery by using the New Austrian tunnelling method and stacked under New Hampshire Avenue.

===Legal and funding battles===

In December 1978, Metro announced that the new completion date of the Green Line past the Anacostia station to Rosecroft Raceway would be 1987, a year later than anticipated. Metro also announced that cost considerations had forced it to abandon the high-vault ceiling design for all unbuilt stations (except Navy Yard), and that a less-costly design would be used at all unbuilt Green Line stations. By July 1979, despite the release of billions of dollars in construction funds by the U.S. Department of Transportation, Metro had pushed back the construction of the Anacostia station to mid-1985 and the completion of the Branch Avenue extension to late 1986. But construction schedules continued to slip: despite reaffirming its construction schedules in December 1979, Metro announced in January 1980 that completion of the Green Line terminus in Prince George&#x27;s County would be pushed back six more months to 1987.

Even as Metro officially designated Rosecroft Raceway as the Green Line&#x27;s southern terminus, more than half of Prince George&#x27;s County&#x27;s representatives in the Maryland state legislature asked Governor Harry Hughes to review the proposed route after allegations of improper political pressure regarding the 1978 route decision surfaced. Metro officials proceeded anyway in March 1984 with Green Line design and planning, and moved the line&#x27;s completion date up to late 1986.

====1980 troubles and near-cancellation====
Funding troubles delayed construction even further. In March 1980, Maryland officials worried that high inflation would leave Metro without enough funds to complete the Green Line, forcing Maryland to bear these construction costs alone. These fears were confirmed in part in September 1980 when Metro announced that inflation had created a $16 million shortfall in its $271 million budget. By now, Anacostia residents were increasingly angry at the repeated delays in building the Green Line. In September 1980, D.C. City Council member Jerry A. Moore, Jr. delivered a petition containing 1,000 signatures from Anacostia residents demanding that construction on the Green Line be sped up.

In October 1980, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; ran a major article asking &quot;What Ever Happened to the Green Line?&quot; in which the newspaper concluded: &quot;The 18.86-mile (30.35 kilometer) Green Line, which some argue should have been the first built because it would serve the most disadvantaged sections of the Washington area, is last on the construction list and threatened with extinction.&quot; The article confirmed that funds were in place and contracts signed to complete the Green Line to the proposed Anacostia station at Howard Road SE and Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue SE, but that repeated local opposition in Maryland to the line&#x27;s actual location had forced planners to delay final siting of the line inside the District of Columbia. Additionally, Maryland businessmen argued that the switch of the terminus from Branch Avenue to Rosecroft Raceway had economically harmed them, and they filed a suit in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland demanding a halt to construction of the Green Line until the line&#x27;s route could be again reconsidered.

The District of Columbia government responded by threatening to veto any further Metro subway construction unless construction of the Green Line was made Metro&#x27;s highest priority. Twenty-four hours of intense discussions later, Metro agreed to the District government&#x27;s wishes. Construction began on the Waterfront station, which was largely complete by January 1981. Once complete, the station was used for storage. By December 1980, Metro was still predicting that the Green Line to Anacostia would open in July 1986, but in January 1981, Metro admitted that the line would not open until at least 1990 because of funding constraints. Two months later, Metro estimated the cost of building the Green Line from U Street NW to Anacostia at $175 million.

====1981====
Controversies regarding the siting of the Green Line continued. In May 1980, a group of business owners near the former proposed terminus at Branch Avenue and Auth Road near Marlow Heights sued Metro on the grounds that the decision to change the course of the Green Line was illegal because it had been undertaken without a public hearing (in violation of Metro&#x27;s rules). In February 1981, Judge Norman Park Ramsey of the U.S. District for Maryland held that Metro did not correctly advertise the hearings at which the change would be discussed. Metro appealed the ruling, and Judge Ramsey did not enjoin Metro from proceeding with construction until the appeal was resolved. The Prince George&#x27;s County government, however, reaffirmed in April 1981 its support for the Rosecroft Raceway terminus, and Metro promised to hold a public hearing on the issue in June 1981. Shortly thereafter, the civil rights office of the U.S. Department of Transportation sent a letter to Metro warning that the Rosecroft Raceway route could negatively impact two historically black communities nearby. In May 1981, Metro changed its estimate for the opening of the Green Line to Anacostia to early 1988.

Prince George&#x27;s County officials continued to worry that cutbacks in federal funding for mass transit might lead to the cancellation of the four proposed stations in the county (, , , and ). Prince George&#x27;s County officials vetoed in July 1981 any further expenditure of Metro&#x27;s construction funds unless Metro diverted $100 million from the Red Line extension in Montgomery County to and began the immediate purchase of land and rights-of-way in Prince George&#x27;s County. Metro agreed a month later to the plan, with the provision that $90 million per year would be spent to begin work on the inner-city portion of the Green Line (the Gallery Place, Waterfront, and Navy Yard stations).

Metro held its long-awaited hearings over the Green Line&#x27;s route in October 1981, but only in Prince George&#x27;s County (not the District). A month later, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals turned down Metro&#x27;s appeal. Metro subsequently estimated on December 9, 1981, that the Green Line would reach Anacostia in late 1989.

====1982====
Funding problems delayed construction even further. In February 1982, President Ronald Reagan proposed cutting Metro construction funds by 21.4% to just $295 million a year. Planned Green Line construction constituted 40.5% of Metro&#x27;s construction budget, and the cuts threatened to cancel the entire Green Line. To African American community leaders, the cuts were evidence that Metrorail was meant for suburban white commuters while inner city African Americans were relegated to taking Metrobus. Despite the funding troubles, Metro planned to seek contractors in March 1982 for a $60 million contract to tunnel under the Anacostia River, a $60 million contract to build the Anacostia station, and a $100 million contract to build the Navy Yard station. However, on March 16, 1982, Judge Ramsey barred Metro from spending any money on the construction of the Rosecroft Raceway route for the southern half of the Green Line. The judge held that Metro had decided to shift the Green Line route without properly advertising the public hearings, which the transit system would now be required to hold again, delaying construction of the Green Line and Anacostia station by at least a year. Although Metro had advertised the hearings, Judge Ramsey said, the advertisements contained the same wording flaws that had precipitated the Maryland lawsuit. Metro subsequently scheduled new hearings for June 1982.

Metro officials considered shifting construction funds from the southern Green Line to the northern Green Line in order to start construction on that end of the line, but the D.C. City Council opposed this shift. Metro held the court-ordered hearings in June 1982, at which Prince George&#x27;s residents argued that they had voted for Metro&#x27;s 1968 bond issue based on the original Green Line route. Metro promised attendees at the hearing that agency staff would study the Green Line route and issue a report recommending a route, after which construction on the Anacostia River tunnel would begin. The site of the tunnel thus became an issue, with some residents arguing for a tunnel from the Navy Yard under Anacostia Park to Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue SE, while others wanted the tunnel to take a more northerly route alongside the 11th Street Bridges to Good Hope Road SE. In October 1982, Metro estimated that opening of the Green Line to Anacostia would happen in the &quot;late 1980s&quot;, and in November a Metro staff report recommended construction of the Rosecroft Raceway route.

Cuts in federal construction funds for Metro again delayed construction. Metro announced in December 1982 that service on the line would not cross the Anacostia River until late 1989 at the earliest. The federal contribution to Metro&#x27;s construction fund was lowered to $44 million from $95 million for fiscal 1983, and Metro said that it would divert most of that money to dig tunnels from to . In February 1983, the Reagan administration proposed cutting Metro&#x27;s construction budget by $145 million to $230 million, which Metro said would push the opening of the Green Line to 1991. On February 11, 1983, Metro, for the first time in its history, formally announced that (absent full construction funding) it could not build the Green Line, the Red Line from to , or the Yellow Line from to .

====Anacostia terminus====
As Metro struggled to secure construction funding for the Green Line and Anacostia station, it also struggled to lift the district court&#x27;s injunction on Green Line construction. Metro asked the court to allow construction of the Navy Yard, Anacostia, and Congress Heights stations pending a decision on the Green Line route in Prince George&#x27;s County, but the court refused. Judge Ramsey said that Metro&#x27;s public hearing process was biased and &quot;inadequate&quot;. Even as the court refused to let Green Line construction in Anacostia begin, more than 23,000 Anacostia residents signed a public petition demanding that the line be built. Metro declined to appeal Judge Ramsey&#x27;s latest ruling, and the Prince George&#x27;s County Council voted to reverse its earlier decision and support the original Green Line route to Branch Avenue.

Frustrated by funding constraints and the court injunction, in December 1983 Metro released a proposed &quot;final&quot; system map that showed the Green Line terminating at the Anacostia and Mount Vernon Square stations.

===Resolution of controversies===

In 1984, Metro undertook two steps to secure completion of the Green Line. First, the transit agency hired former U.S. Secretary of Transportation William T. Coleman, Jr. in December 1983 to oversee negotiations with the various entities involved with the siting of the Green Line route and seek a resolution through the U.S. district court. On February 21, 1984, Prince George&#x27;s County Executive Parris Glendening announced that construction of the Green Line in Prince George&#x27;s must start by September 30, 1984, or he would begin vetoing Metro spending proposals. At the same time, Metro and Coleman opened negotiations to build the Green Line from the L&#x27;Enfant Plaza Station to Anacostia. Advocates of the Rosecroft route, however, warned that they would sue if Metro switched back to the original route.

Just four days later, Metro, D.C. and Prince George&#x27;s County officials, reached an agreement with advocates of both the Branch Avenue and Rosecroft routes to begin construction from L&#x27;Enfant Plaza to Anacostia, pending resolution of the line&#x27;s final route by December 6, 1984. The agreement called for construction of the Green Line to Waterfront station in the summer, siting of the tunnel under the Anacostia River by June 28, and the holding of public hearings on the remaining route between July 18 and August 3. The U.S. Federal District Court approved the agreement on March 7. Following the ruling, Metro announced that it would build the Anacostia station on Howard Road between Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue SE and the Anacostia Freeway, as well as a new Metro station at the Washington Navy Yard, and would open the Green Line by 1990. Metro asked and won approval from the court to build the Navy Yard and Anacostia stations and the tunnel in June 1984.

Metro also began new political efforts to secure funding to complete the transit system. Initially, Reagan administration officials balked at this plan, reiterating that they would not permit Metro to build more than of subway. But in June, House and Senate committees passed legislation requiring the Reagan administration to release all funds appropriated for Metro, putting pressure on the administration to rescind its mileage limit.

===Bus controversy===
Like all Metrorail stations, Anacostia station was intended to be a major hub for Metrobus service in the area. However, with the Anacostia neighborhood being the poorest and most transit-dependent area in the District of Columbia, changes to bus routes in the area proved highly controversial. As the opening of the Green Line to Anacostia neared, WMATA proposed halving the number of bus routes traveling between Anacostia and the National Archives Building downtown. That would force riders to take the more expensive Metrorail and require many riders to walk several blocks to their destination, rather than the &quot;virtually door-to-door service&quot; that they enjoyed. A total of 25 routes were changed, affecting more than 80,000 riders.

Many of the new routes now terminated at the Anacostia station, rather than continuing into downtown Washington. WMATA officials admitted that fares for most Anacostia residents would rise an average of 50% and that Anacostia residents would be forced to pay more and travel farther to access the services (such as doctors) and shopping that most District residents can readily access. To help mediate the impact of the total fare increase on Anacostia residents, WMATA reduced basic bus fares for many routes in the area from $1 to 35 cents.

====Protests and boycott====
District residents protested the route cuts with a picket line in front of WMATA&#x27;s downtown headquarters in August 1991. Prince George&#x27;s County residents were also angered by the changes. They argued that Metro had promised more, not less, bus service and complained that they would be forced to use a rail station located in the District of Columbia&#x27;s most violent and crime-prone neighborhood. More than 1,000 people packed &quot;raucous&quot; public hearings for three nights in the District and Prince George&#x27;s County in early September that denounced Metro and claimed that they were &quot;becoming a victim of transportational apartheid.&quot; Worried about the impact of the cuts as well as a possible bus boycott, D.C. Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly (later Sharon Pratt Dixon) announced on September 11, 1991, that she would seek an alternative to the changes proposed by WMATA. Suburban commuters were angry that Metro would keep the bus routes open in Anacostia, at an estimated cost of $4 million, when their bus service had been cut when Metrorail stations opened in their areas; D.C. residents countered that poor African American District citizens could not afford the same transit changes and fare increases that wealthy, white suburbanites were asked to absorb.
Calls for a boycott increased in mid-September. On September 16, 1991, declaring that the city paid &quot;40 percent of the Metro subsidy, but we&#x27;re the last to get service,&quot; Mayor Dixon threatened to withhold the District&#x27;s payment to Metro unless the bus changes were rescinded. Metro officials were angered by Dixon&#x27;s statement and said that District officials had been involved in the bus route planning process for months. Mayor Dixon proposed on September 20 for Metro to continue to use Anacostia station as a hub but with bus service provided into downtown D.C. The plan, estimated to cost less than $500,000 a year, would require residents to transfer at Anacostia station but would not raise the total fare to more than $1. A month later, Metro&#x27;s board of directors unanimously agreed to accept Dixon&#x27;s plan and cancelled all planned route changes in the District of Columbia and Prince George&#x27;s County. The cost of operating the bus routes totaled $2.5 million annually. The compromise led residents to call off their boycott of Metrobus.

Prince George&#x27;s County, meanwhile, had announced that its county-run buses (&quot;The Bus&quot;) would not run to Anacostia Station, as previously promised, drawing outrage from the D.C. representatives on Metro&#x27;s board. The District of Columbia had spent more than $20 million adding bus bays at the station to accommodate The Bus arrivals.

====Fare loss====
Two months after the Anacostia station opened, WMATA said that a study of bus and rail ridership showed that the unaltered bus routes were costing the transit agency $200,000 a month in lost rail fares. To make up the lost revenue, WMATA said that it would run only two-car trains (the shortest on the system) on the Green Line during slow periods on weekdays and evenings and on Sundays beginning in June 1992. In November 1992, WMATA reported that ridership at the Anacostia station was (on average) 7,500 riders a day, 700 below estimates. WMATA admitted that although riders had made the switch from bus to rail, the lower ridership numbers were caused by the recession, not because of continuing downtown bus service in the area. Metro said ridership on buses in the neighborhood was down significantly, and the transit agency reduced the number of buses on some routes to avoid having empty buses.

===Rail car shortage===

WMATA first became aware of a rail car shortage in 1988. Although the transit authority knew that it needed at least 98 new rail cars to provide adequate service to the new stations to be added on the Green Line and other lines by 1993, it did not place an order for the cars. Metrorail also suffered from internal squabbling over rail car design, and rail car production had historically been plagued by poor quality and labor strikes—both of which added to construction delays. By September 1990, more frequent breakdowns in the existing, aging rail car fleet heightened the urgency to buy more cars. Officials estimated that the rail car shortage would become critical when the Anacostia station opened. When the Van Dorn Street station opened in June 1991, Metro was forced to run trains every 12 minutes during rush hour rather than every 8 due to the rail car shortage. Eventually, crowding was addressed when additional cars became available by running 8-car trains.

Metro also encountered significant problems estimating the number of riders who would board the system at the Anacostia and other Green Line stations. In June 1991, WMATA estimated that just over 15,000 riders on average would board at the Waterfront, Navy Yard, and Anacostia stations. In December 1991, when the Anacostia station opened, Metro had revised that number to 30,700 riders per day (by June 1992). Just a week later, Metro dropped that estimate to only 28,000 riders a day (by June 1992).

Even though significant numbers of bus riders in Anacostia had switched to Metrorail by February 1992, WMATA nonetheless began running two- rather than four-car trains on the Green Line on Sundays and during slow periods in order to close a revenue shortfall.

Metro finally ordered new rail cars, but the first of the cars were not due to be delivered until February 2001.

The January 13, 2001 opening of the final five Green Line stations (Congress Heights, Southern Avenue, Naylor Road, Suitland, and Branch Avenue) significantly worsened overcrowding and service problems on the line. The five new stations added almost 20,000 new riders a day, overwhelming station platforms, jamming trains to capacity, and forcing many riders at Anacostia and other stations up the line to wait as train after train passed them, filled. Metro had estimated that 18,000 riders a day would board from these stations by June 2001. That estimate was exceeded by 2,000 riders a day on the second day the stations were open.

By January 24, the number had risen to more than 30,600 per day, three times as many as originally estimated. Angry commuters using the Anacostia, Navy Yard, and Waterfront stations peppered the transit agency with complaints. WMATA claimed that a number of factors contributed to the ridership crunch: the system was experiencing record ridership; two-year-old ridership projections were used; the five stations were opened two months ahead of schedule; the five new stations were opened two months before new rail cars were ready for service; and WMATA offered free parking at the Green Line stations, which drew 12,000 rather than 4,000 riders to the line.

==Construction and opening==

===1984===
Construction of the Green Line south from L&#x27;Enfant Plaza began in July 1984 when WMATA issued a call for bids to tunnel under the Anacostia River. The firm of Harrison Western/Franki-Denys (a joint venture) was awarded the $25.6 million contract, with construction to begin in December 1984. WMATA delayed awarding the contract after American anti-apartheid activists alleged that a Belgian company with a minority financial interest in Franki-Denys did business with the racist white-led government of South Africa, but after the links were discovered to be extremely minor the contract was awarded.

The debate over the route for the remainder of the Green Line was finally resolved in December 1984. Residents and D.C. government officials asked WMATA to build stations at Congress Heights and Southern Avenue in order to promote economic development and provide service to St. Elizabeths Hospital and Greater Southeast Community Hospital. In December 1984, WMATA&#x27;s Board of Directors agreed to return the Green Line to its original route, and build the Congress Heights and Southern Avenue stations. The U.S. district court approved WMATA&#x27;s decision and dissolved its March 1982 injunction, which had barred construction of the $483 million southern Green Line (now estimated to cost $132 million more than the Rosecroft route).

===1985===
Funding for Green Line construction fell into place in 1985. Pressured by the previous year&#x27;s Congressional action, the Reagan administration sought to provide WMATA with $250 million a year for four years to expand the system to , a plan which would not fund construction of the system beyond the proposed Southern Avenue station.

Construction on the line started in 1985. Survey and clearing work for the twin 2,500-foot (762 m) Anacostia River tunnels began in March 1985. A 24-foot (7.32 m) long, 19 foot (5.8 m) diameter tunnel boring machine built by the Hitachi Zosen Corporation was shipped to the U.S. to drill the tunnel, which required boring techniques &quot;so novel that they have never before been used in the eastern United States.&quot; The tunnel boring machine ate through &quot;T5&quot; (relatively fine sand mixed with gravel and boulders which occasionally required workers to physically break the boulders apart) and clay formations about beneath the riverbed. The walls of the tunnel were lined with concrete as the machine moved. Liquid nitrogen was used to harden the ground where the inbound tunnel reached the northern side of the Anacostia River, to lessen the possibility of cave-ins due to the wet earth.
The completion date for the two tunnels was estimated at late 1987. WMATA engineers also inspected the mothballed Waterfront station and found it to be still structurally sound (although water needed to be pumped from the station). However, some repairs to the tunnel between L&#x27;Enfant Plaza and Waterfront needed to be made. Construction of the tunnel from Waterfront to Navy Yard was set to begin in September 1985, construction of the Navy Yard station in early 1986, and linkage with the Anacostia River tunnels shortly thereafter. The two new Green Line stations were expected to open in 1990. In October 1985, WMATA awarded the $24.9 million contract to excavate the tunnel between the Waterfront and Navy Yard stations to Harrison Western Corp. WMATA&#x27;s board awarded a $41.5 million contract for the construction of the Anacostia station to Kiewit Construction Co. in June 1985, and said the station would open in 1990. Ground was broken at the site on September 21, 1985.

===1986–88===
Funding for construction of the Green Line was threatened again in 1986. WMATA needed $2 billion in construction funds, but Congress was threatening to cut WMATA&#x27;s funding by up to 26% to $184.5 million a year for four years. Congress approved $227 million for 1986 in December 1985, but the Reagan administration said that it would cut off all funding thereafter. WMATA appealed directly to President Reagan to release $400 million in funds already appropriated, but administration officials said WMATA had more than enough money to complete the Green Line. Prince George&#x27;s County officials threatened to sue Metro as well as block all further construction spending in March 1985 unless WMATA agreed to use its existing funds to build the Green Line into their county. WMATA officials reacted in June by stretching out construction of the Green Line and Anacostia station to 1991. After lengthy negotiations (which included state and local guarantees to pay for cost overruns or funding shortfalls, penalties for defaults, and the imposition of two external financial monitors) and heavy pressure from Congress, Reagan administration officials released the $400 million on July 16, 1986.
With the funds released, construction on the Green Line proceeded quickly. In November 1986, WMATA awarded a $36.2 million contract to Mergentime Corp. to build the Navy Yard station. A month later, WMATA awarded a $19.5 million contract to excavate a tunnel from the Navy Yard Station to the tunnels being built under the Anacostia River. On March 23, 1986, the second of the two , concrete-lined tunnels under the Anacostia River was completed. With the tunnels finished and other contracts awarded, WMATA announced yet another revised timeline for opening the Green Line in April 1987. The transit agency estimated that the , Shaw, and stations would open in late 1990, the Mount Vernon Square to Anacostia link in late 1991, and the to link by 1994. In January 1988, WMATA awarded a $179.1 million contract to build the Green Line from Fort Totten to Greenbelt, and a $6.9 million contract to complete the Waterfront station. In December 1988, WMATA reaffirmed that the Waterfront, Navy Yard, and Anacostia stations would open in late 1991.

===Extension south of Anacostia===
Beginning in 1989, WMATA sought funding to extend the Green Line beyond the Anacostia station and to operate the Green Line. Metro asked Congress to authorize $2.16 billion over 10 years to complete the system, as well as appropriate the remaining $193 million from the transit agency&#x27;s original 1980 authorization to complete the Green Line from Anacostia to and link the Green Line internally between U Street and Fort Totten. Although the Bush administration opposed the request, Congress provided $2.025 billion. Only the stations at and Branch Avenue remained unfunded.

By mid-1991, however, falling inflation had reduced WMATA&#x27;s construction costs so much that the agency said it could build the two final Green Line stations in Prince George&#x27;s County without asking Congress for additional money. WMATA also proposed spending money almost three times faster up-front to accelerate its construction schedule, a move which would be more than compensated for by savings in out-years. Prince George&#x27;s County officials threatened to block all further Metrorail construction unless they received guarantees that the stations in their county would be built. Funding for the remaining seven Green Line stations in the District and Prince George&#x27;s remained in doubt as of August 1991, with District officials saying that it made sense to build the and stations and Prince George&#x27;s representatives demanding that the three stations in their county be completed. WMATA said that it had so little money it could not fund 16 critical small construction projects, among them security gates at the Navy Yard and Waterfront stations and parts for escalators at the seven new Green Line stations in D.C. and Prince George&#x27;s County. The funding impasse was broken in November 1991 when local and state governments agreed to roughly triple their contribution to Metro&#x27;s construction costs by 1994 to complete the entire system.

The first WMATA budget which contained funds for operating the Green Line was proposed in December 1989. The budget presumed a December 1, 1990, opening for the Mt. Vernon Square, Shaw–Howard University and U Street–Cardozo stations, and requested funds to test the soon-to-open Green Line from Gallery Place–Chinatown to the Anacostia station. The budget also projected that this section of the line would open in 1991, and that new Metrobus service will be added in Prince George&#x27;s County to bring commuters to the new station.

===Opening delays===

====Change of contractor====
The opening of the Green Line was significantly delayed, however, when in May 1990 WMATA fired the contractor building the Shaw–Howard University and U Street–Cardozo stations. Mergentime/Perini Joint Venture, the contractor working on the stations, had violated its contract with WMATA by reducing the workforce on the project, not meeting project deadlines, and permitting unsafe working conditions to persist. Mergentime/Perini denied the accusations. Although similar problems plagued Mergentime/Perini&#x27;s work on the Navy Yard station, WMATA did not fire the joint venture company from that project. WMATA said that the problems would delay the Green Line&#x27;s opening until at least the late spring of 1991.

In August 1990, WMATA hired the Perini Corp. as the new contractor, and required the company to finish the job and rebuild the streets in the area, setting a new Green Line dedication of December 1991. Federal monitors overseeing WMATA&#x27;s spending, however, issued a report in August 1990 accusing WMATA of poor financial oversight of the project and blamed the transit agency for the delays and problems Mergentime/Perini confronted. Mergentime/Perini sued WMATA, claiming that it was improperly dismissed from the project.

====Other problems====
The cost of testing and operating the Green Line left WMATA struggling financially. These costs (along with costs associated with extending and operating the Blue Line to ) forced WMATA to cut 335 jobs as well as supplies, travel, overtime, and temporary employee budgets. Although ridership was projected to rise 3.8% to 260 million trips in the coming year, the increased revenue was not expected to cover the costs of operating the new lines and stations. Mount Vernon Square, Shaw–Howard University, and U Street–Cardozo stations opened on Saturday, May 11, 1991.

Construction of the Green Line past Anacostia station was complicated by the discovery of a potential toxic waste site in the path of the subway. In June 1991, WMATA discovered that the District of Columbia had dumped 426,000 tons of possibly hazardous incinerator bottom ash in an unused exposed culvert along the subway&#x27;s potential path near St. Elizabeth&#x27;s Hospital between 1977 and 1989. The city continued to dump the ash at the site for four years after it learned that WMATA planned to use the site for the Green Line. Experts were concerned that the ash dump contained pockets of methane gas and soluble acid, which would make the site unusable by Metrorail.

Maryland officials used the discovery to press yet again for realignment of the Green Line and abandonment of the planned stations at Congress Heights and Southern Avenue in favor of construction of the stations at , Suitland, and Branch Avenue. The proposal led to public protests against the Maryland plan in Anacostia, and heated arguments on the WMATA board of directors. In an initial report in June 1991, WMATA determined that ash posed no environmental risk, although there were concerns that the level of pollutants would prevent any excavated material from being accepted by landfills in D.C., Maryland, or Virginia. A final environmental report in November 1991 found that the ash was not hazardous, but would need to be removed at a cost of $1 million.

===1991 extension===
The Green Line from L&#x27;Enfant Plaza to Anacostia opened as scheduled on December 28, 1991. Ridership expanded rapidly on the Green Line. In the first workweek of the year, more than 8,000 riders a day boarded at the three stations in Southeast D.C. (more than 5,000 of them at Anacostia), exceeding WMATA&#x27;s estimates, and nearly 10,000 riders were boarding each day at the three stations by the third week of January.

Construction of the Green Line near Berwyn Heights, Maryland resulted in the creation of Lake Artemesia. In 1976, WMATA removed sand and gravel needed for construction from open space adjacent to the Green Line. In exchange, WMATA paid to develop the area as a lake surrounded by a park.

===1993 extension===
The , , Prince George&#x27;s Plaza, and stations opened in December 1993. Almost two years later, WMATA broke ground on the Suitland, Naylor Road, Southern Avenue, and Congress Heights stations, a $900 million project which would complete the final of the originally-planned Metrorail system in late 1999. The outbound tunnel to Congress Heights was completed in June 1998. The Georgia Avenue–Petworth and Columbia Heights stations were completed in September 1999, three months ahead of schedule. The Green Line&#x27;s final five stations opened on January 13, 2001.

===Recent years===
Service on the Green Line tracks began on May 11, 1991 on three stations between U Street and Gallery Place–Chinatown. Initially, all trains through this section were run as Yellow Line trains terminating at . The Green Line formally began on December 28, 1991, with three stations south of L&#x27;Enfant Plaza to Anacostia. At this time, Yellow Line service north of Mount Vernon Square was discontinued and those stations were served only by the new Green Line. The four-station branch north of Fort Totten to opened on December 11, 1993. The two segments were connected on September 18, 1999, with two stations opening, and the last five stations south to Branch Avenue opened on January 13, 2001, completing the original Metrorail system.

After the branch north of Fort Totten opened, the Green Line Commuter Shortcut began as a six-month experiment on January 27, 1997, allowing passengers to get on a train on the Green Line segment during rush hours and travel as far as on the Red Line without having to switch trains at Fort Totten; a transfer was needed during off-peak hours. This was accomplished by utilizing a single-track spur (B &amp; E connection) between the Green and Red Lines near (and bypassing) Fort Totten station. This shortcut was so well-received that it was continued until September 17, 1999, when the mid-city portion of the Green Line was completed.
In 2006, WMATA board member Jim Graham and D.C. Mayor Anthony A. Williams proposed re-extending Yellow Line service to or even to Greenbelt, (which was the originally planned northern terminus for the line). Their proposal did not involve construction of any new track, because either extension would run along the same route as the existing Green Line and would thus relieve crowding on that line. Suburban members of the board initially resisted the proposal. Through a compromise that also increased service on the Red Line, on April 20, 2006 the WMATA board approved a Yellow Line extension to the Fort Totten station during off-peak hours. An 18-month pilot program began on December 31, 2006, at a cost of $5.75 million to the District of Columbia. At the end of the pilot, the program was extended and as of April 2019, is operational today.

From March 26, 2020 until June 28, 2020, trains were bypassing , , and stations due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. All stations were reopened beginning on June 28, 2020.

Between May 29 to September 6, 2021, all Green Line trains terminated at due to the Platform Improvement Project which closed stations north of Fort Totten. Shuttle buses were provided to the closed stations.

Between July 22 to September 4, 2023, all Green Line trains terminated at Fort Totten to improve rail system technologies on the closed stations north of Fort Totten.

==Route==

The southern terminus of the Green Line is near the intersection of Branch Avenue (Maryland Route 5) and Auth Way, just inside the Capital Beltway near Andrews Air Force Base. The route goes northwest through a park to join the right of way of the Suitland Parkway. It veers southeast along Southern Avenue SE and then north on 13th Street SE to rejoin Suitland Parkway. The line then crosses the Anacostia River and tunnels under the Washington Navy Yard and travels west under M Street SE. It then joins the Yellow Line in a tunnel under 7th Street SW, with the Yellow Line terminating at . The tunnel bends west along Florida Avenue NW and U Street NW and then turns north under Park Road NW and 14th Street NW. The tunnel turns northeast under New Hampshire Avenue NW and across Fort Totten Park, intersecting the Red Line. The Green Line runs east through Fort Circle Park and tunnels under Queens Chapel Road (Maryland Route 500) to emerge along the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad right of way to adjacent to the Capital Beltway.

Internally, the Green Line is known as the Greenbelt Route (E) and the Branch Avenue Route (F), which meet at the center of the lower level platform of (whose Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) code is F01, the first station on the Branch Avenue Route).

Along with the Red Line, the Green Line is one of two Metro lines that does not enter Virginia. It is the only Metro line to run entirely inside the Capital Beltway.

The Green Line requires 19 trains (10 eight-car trains and nine six-car trains, consisting of 134 rail cars) to run at peak capacity. There are rail yard facilities near the Branch Ave and Greenbelt stations. 

As of March 2018, all Green Line trains are required to only run 8 car trains.

==Stations==
The following stations are on the Green Line. They are listed from south to north.

== Future ==
A proposed extension from the line&#x27;s Greenbelt terminus to Baltimore/Washington International Airport has been studied. This expansion, which would also serve the Laurel and Fort Meade areas of central Maryland, would link the Washington Metro system to the Baltimore Light RailLink of the Maryland Transit Administration.

<doc id="559538" wikidata="Q16091796" url="?curid=559538" title="Lefty Driesell">
<text>Charles Grice &quot;Lefty&quot; Driesell (December 25, 1931 – February 17, 2024) was an American college basketball coach. He was the first coach to win more than 100 games at four different NCAA Division I schools, Driesell led the programs of Davidson College, the University of Maryland, James Madison University, and Georgia State University. He earned a reputation as &quot;the greatest program builder in the history of basketball.&quot; At the time of his retirement in 2003, he was the fourth-winningest NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball college coach, with 21 seasons of 20 or more wins, and 21 conference or conference tournament titles. Driesell played college basketball at Duke University.

==Early life==
Driesell was born on December 25, 1931, in Norfolk, Virginia, to Frank Driesell, a jeweler who had emigrated from Germany. In the fourth grade, Driesell received the nickname &quot;Lefty&quot; for his left-handedness. He attended Granby High School and quickly became a star on the basketball team. Driesell earned the city&#x27;s most outstanding player trophy and All-State recognition while leading Granby to the Virginia State Basketball Championship. He was named tournament MVP, totaling 59 points in three games.

After graduating high school in 1950, Driesell received a full scholarship to attend Duke University, where he played center on the basketball team under head coach Harold Bradley. Driesell graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in education in 1954.

==Coaching career==
After college in 1954, Driesell took an office job with the Ford Motor Company. Driesell also found time to renew his playing career by joining the Virginia semi-pro ranks, where he once scored 59 points in a single game and earned a tryout with the then Minneapolis Lakers (later Los Angeles Lakers) of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was also given a chance to enter the coaching profession when his prep alma mater offered him its junior varsity position for both football and basketball. After convincing his wife he could offset a significant pay cut by also selling World Book Encyclopedias part-time, he accepted the job and produced back-to-back unbeaten football teams and a city basketball champion in his first two years.

Driesell was promoted to varsity basketball coach in 1957, going 15–5 before moving to traditional in-state basketball power Newport News High School. There he inherited a team in the midst of a winning streak that he would build to a still-standing state record 57 straight. That unbeaten team won the Virginia Group I State Championship, besting his old Granby squad with four of his former starters. His combined varsity record at the two schools was 97–15.

===Davidson===

Driesell served as the head coach at Davidson from 1960 to 1969. During his tenure his teams won three Southern Conference tournaments and five regular season championships, earning him the Southern Conference Sportswriters Association Coach of the Year award four years running from 1963 to 1966. An excellent recruiter at each of his collegiate coaching stops, Driesell landed Dick Snyder, a second-round selection by the St. Louis Hawks. He cinched his wooing of college prospect Don Davidson by telling him &quot;I&#x27;ll put your name on the front [of your jersey]&quot;. When legendary NC State head coach Everett Case attempted to lure Driesell with an assistant position offer he replied, &quot;Coach, I got a better team than you got. Why would I do that?&quot;

===Maryland===
Driesell was hired by the University of Maryland, College Park in 1969. During his introductory press conference on March 19, 1969, he boldly stated that Maryland &quot;has the potential to be the UCLA of the East Coast or I wouldn&#x27;t be here,&quot; referring to the nation&#x27;s dominant college basketball program in the middle of an unrivaled dynasty. While Driesell fell short of that overreaching goal, he was successful in leading the Terrapins to eight NCAA tournament appearances, a National Invitation Tournament (NIT) championship, two Atlantic Coast Conference regular season championships, and one Atlantic Coast Conference tournament championship. Maryland was ranked as high as No. 2 in the Associated Press rankings for four consecutive seasons from 1972 to 1976, and produced a number of All-Americans, including the No. 2 pick in the 1986 NBA draft, Len Bias.

Driesell coached the Maryland Terrapins from 1969 to 1986. In 1974, he signed a can&#x27;t miss prospect, 6&#x27; 10&quot; center Moses Malone. Instead, Malone opted to join the ABA Utah Stars, becoming the first modern era player to proceed directly from high school into professional basketball; he became a three-time NBA MVP, and Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer. Among other top names during Driesell&#x27;s Maryland tenure were NBA stars Tom McMillen, Len Elmore, John Lucas, Albert King, Buck Williams, Adrian Branch, and Brad Davis.
At Maryland, Driesell began the now nationwide tradition of Midnight Madness. According to longstanding NCAA rules, college basketball teams were not permitted to begin practices until October 15. Driesell traditionally began the first practice with a requirement that his players run one mile in six minutes, but found that the players were too fatigued to practice effectively immediately afterwards. At 12:03 a.m. on October 15, 1971, Driesell held a one-mile run at the track around Byrd Stadium, where a crowd of 1,000 fans had gathered after learning of the unorthodox practice session. The event soon became a tradition to build excitement for the basketball team&#x27;s upcoming season. Midnight Madness has been adopted by many national programs such as UNC, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan State, and Duke.

In 1972, Maryland defeated Niagara, 100–69 to secure the NIT championship. Driesell said that the season attained the three goals he had set for the program at the time of his hiring: &quot;national prominence&quot;, &quot;national ranking&quot;, and &quot;a national championship&quot;.

On July 12, 1973, Driesell saved the lives of at least ten children from several burning buildings. He and two other men were surf fishing around midnight in Bethany Beach, Delaware when he saw flames coming from a seashore resort. Driesell broke down a door and rescued several children from the fire that eventually destroyed four townhouses. An eyewitness, Prince George&#x27;s County circuit court Judge Samuel Meloy, said, &quot;Let&#x27;s face it, Driesell was a hero. There were no injuries and it was a miracle because firemen didn&#x27;t come for at least 30 minutes.&quot; Driesell said, &quot;Don&#x27;t build me up as any kind of hero. All we did was try to get the kids out. It was just lucky that we were fishing right in front of the houses.&quot; For these actions, Driesell was awarded the NCAA Award of Valor.

In the 1974 ACC men&#x27;s basketball tournament, Maryland was defeated by North Carolina State University in overtime 103–100, eliminating it from participating in that season&#x27;s NCAA basketball tournament. Many consider it to be one of the greatest college basketball games of all time. NC State eventually went on to win the 1974 National Championship, with Maryland finishing No. 4 in the final Associated Press poll. One great team knocking the other out of the NCAA Tournament prompted its officials to make a landmark decision the next year, expanding its field from 23 to 32 teams, thereby potentially opening the door for more than one team from a conference.

Later in 1974, Maryland represented the United States in the 1974 FIBA Intercontinental Cup that was held in Mexico. There, Driesell successfully led his team to the title after finishing with an unbeaten 5–0 record against Varese from Italy, Vila Nova from Brazil, Real Madrid from Spain, and Panteras de Aguascalientes and Dorados de Chihuahua from Mexico.

He had his detractors despite achieving a relative level of success at Maryland. Clemson head coach Tates Locke famously said about facing Driesell&#x27;s Terrapins, &quot;Keep me even until the last two minutes and I&#x27;ll win.&quot; Paul Attner of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;...Put him in a situation where players from both teams have equal ability and are prepared just as well, and he falls short much of the time. It is at these moments when it is glaringly apparent Driesell is not among that small number of coaches who can be called &#x27;great&#x27;...Once Driesell is placed in a position where pressure decision-making, not hard work, produces a victory, he has problems.&quot;

In 1983, a female student at Maryland accused him of making intimidating phone calls to her after she accused Terrapin player Herman Veal of sexual misconduct, which resulted in Veal being declared ineligible to play for the rest of the season.

In 1984, Driesell led the team to the school&#x27;s second ACC Tournament Championship. In December 1985, the university gave Driesell a ten-year contract extension. On June 19, 1986, Terrapin star Len Bias died in a campus dorm of a cocaine overdose after being drafted by the Boston Celtics. The circumstances surrounding Bias&#x27; death threw the University of Maryland and its athletics program into turmoil. A subsequent investigation revealed that Bias was 21 credits short of the graduation requirement despite having attended the university for four full years, exhausting his athletic eligibility; in his final semester, he had done almost no academic work. Driesell allegedly told Bias&#x27; friends to remove drugs from the room where Bias took the cocaine that killed him.

On October 29, Driesell resigned as head coach and took a position as an assistant athletic director. Maryland had to pay Driesell for the rest of his 10-year contract as head coach because it could not find any wrongdoing on his part. He also worked as a television analyst during college basketball games. Some members of the media widely described Driesell as a scapegoat of chancellor John B. Slaughter and the university administration.

===James Madison===
Driesell resumed his coaching career as the head coach of the James Madison University Dukes in 1988, staying until 1996. His teams captured five Colonial Athletic Association regular season championships, one tournament championship, and an appearance in the NCAA tournament in 1994.

===Georgia State===
Driesell then moved to Georgia State, which he led to four Atlantic Sun Conference regular season championships and one tournament championship in six years. He retired from coaching on January 3, 2003, in the middle of his 41st season as a head coach, ranked No. 4 in NCAA Division I wins behind only Dean Smith, Adolph Rupp, and Bob Knight. Driesell is the only basketball coach to win at least 100 games at four different colleges. Driesell led four of his squads to the NCAA Tournament&#x27;s Elite Eight, but was unable to ever advance to its Final Four. Driesell&#x27;s final record was 786–394.

==Honors and awards==
Driesell earned conference Coach of the Year honors at each of his destinations. He was named the Southern Conference Coach of the Year four times at Davidson (1963–1966), twice named the Atlantic Coast Conference Coach of the Year at Maryland (1975 and 1980), twice named the Colonial Athletic Association Coach of the Year at James Madison (1990 and 1992), and once named the Atlantic Sun Conference Coach of the Year at Georgia State (2001).

Driesell was awarded the NCAA Award of Valor for helping save lives from a July 12, 1973, structure fire.

In 1995, Driesell was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame. On April 2, 2007, Driesell was inducted as a member of the second class of the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame. The University of Maryland Athletic Hall of Fame inducted Driesell in 2002. On August 13, 2008, he was inducted as a member of the inaugural class of the Hampton Roads Sports Hall of Fame, which honors athletes, coaches, and administrators who made contributions to sports in southeastern Virginia. On May 25, 2011, Driesell was inducted into the Southern Conference Hall of Fame.

In 2003, Georgia State University dedicated their basketball court to Driesell.

On April 2, 2010, the first annual Lefty Driesell Award for the best defensive player in NCAA Division I basketball was bestowed upon its first recipient, Jarvis Varnado of Mississippi State.

In February 2017, the University of Maryland hung a banner in the Xfinity Center to honor his career at the university. Lefty accepted the honor alongside of numerous former players, assistant coaches, and family.

Driesell was nominated numerous times for the Basketball Hall of Fame, receiving wide support from contemporaries. In 2018, Driesell was selected for induction into the Hall of Fame. He was formally inducted on September 7, 2018.

==Personal life and death==
While a student at Duke University, Driesell eloped with his wife, Joyce on December 14, 1952. The two had met while in the ninth and eighth grades, respectively. The couple had four children. His son, Chuck, is also a basketball coach who served as an assistant for Driesell at James Madison. Chuck stated, &quot;Dad gave me a lot of responsibility, and we worked hard. As a son and as a player, I&#x27;m not sure I understood how hard he worked.&quot;

Driesell was a Presbyterian, but often attended churches affiliated with other Christian denominations. One of his three daughters, Pam, is a pastor at Trinity Presbyterian Church in Atlanta. In 2003, Driesell retired to Virginia Beach, Virginia His wife died in 2021. He died in Virginia Beach on February 17, 2024, at the age of 92.

<text>Shearman &amp; Sterling was a White shoe multinational law firm headquartered in New York City, United States. In 2024 it merged with Allen &amp; Overy to form A&amp;O Shearman.

==History==
===Wall Street origins===
Shearman &amp; Sterling was founded in New York City in 1873 by Thomas G. Shearman () and John William Sterling, who concentrated on litigation and transactional matters respectively. The young firm represented financier Jay Gould and industrialist Henry Ford, and cultivated a number of important business ties that would evolve into long-standing client relationships, such as with the Rockefeller family and the predecessor banks to Citigroup and Deutsche Bank.

===Postwar global expansion===
The firm expanded internationally during the post-World War II era, under the direction of Boykin C. Wright, a senior partner who joined the firm from Cahill Gordon &amp; Reindel with a group of lawyers, briefly leading the firm to add his name to the letterhead. The firm&#x27;s first international office was established in Paris in 1963.
Bolstering the firm&#x27;s reputation in international law, President Eisenhower tapped partner Fredrick McCurdy Eaton to be the United States&#x27; lead negotiator at the 1960 Nuclear Ten Nation Committee on Disarmament, in Geneva. From 1964 to 1975, Mr. Eaton was the senior partner.

In postwar Germany, Shearman &amp; Sterling helped German companies such as Siemens and BASF restructure their debts and re-emerge as credible exporters to the United States. The firm&#x27;s lawyers assisted Daimler in its listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 1993, the first such listing by a German company, prompting other major companies to follow suit. The firm then represented the German automaker in its purchase and subsequent sale of Chrysler.
The company practices mergers and acquisitions in Germany, and operates one of the largest London offices of a non-UK law firm.

The firm played an important role in the establishment of state-owned oil and gas companies, including Sonatrach in Algeria and throughout the Middle East. In 1979, Shearman &amp; Sterling lawyers represented Citibank during the intense negotiations that ensued during the Iranian Hostage Crisis, after the US government froze all Iranian assets in US banks.

During the 1980s, firm attorneys helped restructure the debts of many Latin American nations in the Brady transactions, and also won mandates in the privatization of numerous state-owned entities. In 2004, the firm launched an office in São Paulo, Brazil and has since represented Brazilian companies in a number of important transactions.

In East Asia, Shearman &amp; Sterling was one of the first firms to grasp the future strategic importance of the Asia-Pacific region, establishing offices in Hong Kong in 1978, followed by Tokyo, Beijing, Singapore and Shanghai. In late 2018, the firm received a license to open an office in Seoul, headed by Singapore partner Anna Chung.

=== 21st century domestic expansion ===
Domestically, Shearman &amp; Sterling opened up an office in Austin in the first half of 2018 and another office in Houston just two months later.

On May 21, 2023, it was announced that Shearman &amp; Sterling had agreed to terms in a merger with UK Magic Circle member Allen &amp; Overy, creating A&amp;O Shearman with over 4,000 attorneys across 49 offices.

== Controversies ==

Among Shearman &amp; Sterling&#x27;s East Asian clients is the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB, which (under the control of Jho Low) had wired $368 million from a Swiss bank to the firm&#x27;s trust account to pay for, among other things, a Beverly Hills hotel, private plane and yacht rentals, and the production of the film The Wolf of Wall Street. Shearman &amp; Sterling was named in a series of civil complaints filed by the DOJ &quot;for having provided a trust account through which hundreds of millions of dollars belonging to Malaysia’s 1MDB fund were illicitly siphoned.&quot; However, the report added that neither Shearman nor any of its lawyers are accused of wrongdoing.

==Recognition==

Shearman &amp; Sterling has attained recognition in a number of legal publications and industry rankings for its work in the United States and internationally across a range of practices areas, including: dispute resolution/litigation, international arbitration, project finance, public international law, capital markets, and mergers and acquisitions.

==Pro bono==

Shearman &amp; Sterling has an active pro bono practice. Globally, the firm was pro bono counsel to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) in Arusha, Tanzania. Shearman routinely assists the ICTR through seconding one lawyer there per month to work on particular projects. The firm also assists FINCA International, the pioneering microcredit and village banking non-profit organization. Other pro bono initiatives include asylum cases, Violence Against Women Act petitions, criminal appeals and art law representations.

<text>The Australia/Israel &amp; Jewish Affairs Council (AIJAC, ), represents the interests of the Australian Jewish community to government, politicians, media and other community groups and organisations through research, commentary and analysis. The organisation is directed by Colin Rubenstein, who was previously a political science lecturer at Monash University. AIJAC has office locations in Melbourne and Sydney. AIJAC is formally associated with the American Jewish Committee.

==History==
===Origins===
The Australia/Israel &amp; Jewish Affairs Council (AIJAC) was founded in 1997 through the merger of two earlier Jewish organisations: Australia-Israel Publications (AIP) and the Australian Institute of Jewish Affairs (AIJA). The Melbourne-based Australia-Israel Publications had been founded in 1974 by Robert (&quot;Bob&quot;) Zablud and Isador Magid to present pro-Israel perspectives in the media and political debate through its monthly journal, the &quot;Australia-Israel Review&quot;. AIP had been established by the Zionist Federation of Australia (ZFA) and the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the two peak representative bodies of the Australian Jewish community, to educate the Australian public about the Middle East in response to growing public criticism of Israel. Under the leadership of Magid and later Mark Leibler, AIP became the best resourced Australian Jewish organisation. During the 1980s, the organisation expanded with the establishment of full-time southern and northern directors in 1982 and of a director of public affairs in 1987.

The second organisation, AIJA, had been founded in 1984 by the Melbourne businessmen Isi Leibler, Richard Pratt, and Mark Besen. AIJA&#x27;s purpose was to conduct and encourage research into issues of concern for the Australian Jewish community. AIJA&#x27;s activities have also included organising several key conferences relating to antisemitism, Jewish education and the National Outlook Conferences, as well as producing research studies on various topics. In 1984, AIJA organised an international conference on antisemitism that hosted several prominent guests including Australian Chief Rabbi Sir Immanuel Jakobovits, Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League, Special Counsel to the United States Ambassador to the United Nations Allan Gerson, Israeli academics Itamar Rabinovich and R.J. Zwi Werblowsky, and B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith lobbyist William Korey. During its history, AIJA attracted more funding from major businessmen and philanthropists than ECAJ.

After Isi Leibler settled in Israel in 1995, he came to believe that the Jewish community needed a more effective advocacy group. Following negotiations, AIP and AIJA merged in 1997 to form AIJAC, which became the main Jewish public advocacy group in Australia.

===1990s===
In May 1997, AIJAC and the American Jewish Committee (AJC) established institutional ties to collaborate on key Jewish communal and international policy issues in the Asia-Pacific region. In 1999, AIJAC and the AJC produced a detailed research study called &quot;Islam in Asia: Changing Political Realities&quot;, which examined the role of Islam in Indonesia, Malaysia, the southern Philippines, and southern Thailand. AIJAC and AJC regarded the growth of Islamic extremism in Asia as a concern for Australian Jews, the wider Australian population, and Israel and have advocated a &quot;peaceful, stable, democratic, and prosperous Southeast Asia&quot;.

In 1998, AIJAC controversially published the far right One Nation party&#x27;s secret membership list as part of its campaign against far right groups. During the 1998 Queensland state election, AIJAC national chairman Mark Leibler and national policy chairman Colin Rubenstein joined forces with other Australian Jewish organisations including ECAJ, the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Anti-Defamation Commission, and the Queensland Jewish Board of Deputies in lobbying Prime Minister John Howard into disavowing any preference deals with One Nation.

===2000s===
In January 2000, AIJAC strongly campaigned against controversial military historian and Holocaust denier David Irving&#x27;s tour of Australia. AIJAC&#x27;s National Chairman Mark Leibler also criticised the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; newspaper for commissioning a poll asking people whether they &quot;agreed with historian David Irving&#x27;s views on the Holocaust&quot;; describing it as offensive to Melbourne&#x27;s Holocaust survivors and arguing that newspaper&#x27;s actions legitimised the claims of Holocaust deniers.

In May 2000, AIJAC condemned the Australian Government&#x27;s decision to vote in favour of two World Bank loans to Iran worth US$232 million; with AIJAC&#x27;s Executive Director Rubenstein claiming that the loans legitimised the Iranian &quot;regime&#x27;s&quot; religious discrimination, terrorism, and human rights violation. AIJAC&#x27;s opposition to the Iranian loans was also influenced by the Iranian government&#x27;s trial and conviction of ten Iranian Jews on fabricated charges of spying for the US and Israel. The Iranian loans were also opposed by the United States, Canadian, and French governments. Historically, AIJAC has urged the Australian Government to exert pressure and limit relations with Iran due to its opposition to the current regime.

In December 2000, AIJAC supported the Victorian Government&#x27;s Racial and Religious Tolerance Act; arguing that free speech had to be balanced with protection from harassment, vilification, incitement to violence, and hate speech. In 2001, AIJAC and most of the Australian Jewish community praised Prime Minister John Howard for condemning the World Conference against Racism 2001 in Durban in September 2001 and praised Australian efforts to moderate the conference&#x27;s proceedings.

Following the September 11 attacks, AIJAC supported the United States-led coalition&#x27;s War on Terror and military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq. AIJAC also campaigned in favour of Australian involvement in the Iraq War. AIJAC and its institutional partner, the American Jewish Committee, were also concerned by the growth of Islamic extremism in Southeast Asia. Following the 2002 Bali bombings, AIJAC exposed the Australian links of Ramzi Yousef, one of the instigators of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and established close links with moderate Southeast Asian leaders such as Indonesian President and Nahdatul Ulama leader Abdurrahman Wahid.

In August 2003, AIJAC joined forces with several other Australian Jewish organisations and media including &quot;Australian Jewish News&quot;, the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies (NSWJBD), the Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ), and the Zionist Federation of Australia in opposing the Sydney Peace Foundation&#x27;s decision to award Palestinian intellectual and PLO official Dr. Hanan Ashrawi the 2003 Sydney Peace Prize. AIJAC published a fact sheet criticising Ashrawi for her alleged anti-Israel rhetoric and extremist views. Despite intense lobbying from Jewish groups and media, the Sydney Peace Foundation refused to rescind Ashrawi&#x27;s prize. On 6 November 2003, New South Wales Premier Bob Carr awarded Ashrawi the 2003 Sydney Peace Prize during a public ceremony at the New South Wales Parliament. Baruch Kimmerling, a sociologist from the Hebrew University, wrote, &quot;As an Israeli, as a Jew and as an academic I am deeply sorry and ashamed that members of the Australian Jewish community are acting against this rightful nomination.&quot;

In 2005, AIJAC praised Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon&#x27;s decision to withdraw from the Gaza Strip, claiming that it proved Israel&#x27;s commitment to peace. AIJAC and most Australian Jewish groups supported the withdrawal from Gaza. AIJAC National Chairman Mark Leibler disagreed with the State Zionist Council of Victoria president Dr Danny Lamm and the State Zionist Council of New South Wales&#x27; president Brian Levitan&#x27;s opposition to the disengagement from Gaza, stating that communal leaders should not express views that &quot;are at odds with the views of the constituency&quot;. At the same time, Leibler defended the right to protest by elements of the Jewish community opposed to the Gaza disengagement. AIJAC analyst Ted Lapkin claimed that Hamas&#x27;s electoral success during the 2006 Palestinian legislative election reflected a long record of Palestinians &quot;spurning opportunities for peace&quot;.

===2010s===
In 2016, AIJAC accused then senator Nick Xenophon of being &quot;highly and one-sidedly critical of Israel&quot; during his time in the Australian Senate. The organisation also criticised the Australian Greens for trying to make Israel the &quot;sole-aggressor&quot; against Palestine.

In 2018, AIJAC lodged a complaint against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation regarding an online article which claimed that Hamas was declared a terrorist organisation because of it activities against Israeli &quot;occupation&quot; of Palestine. The ABC complaints unit agreed with AIJAC that Hamas&#x27;s status was not, according to the Australian Government, based on any occupation. Dr. Rubenstein said:
===2020s===
In October 2022, AIJAC joined Liberal Party leader Peter Dutton, the Zionist Federation of Australia and Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ) in criticising the Albanese government&#x27;s decision to reverse the Morrison government&#x27;s recognition of Jerusalem as the Australian Jewish community. In November 2022 Australian Jewish journalist Antony Loewenstein criticised AIJAC and the ECAJ for supporting Israel&#x27;s military occupation of the Palestinians.

==Aims and activities==
As both a think tank and public affairs organisation, AIJAC&#x27;s stated purpose is to represent the interests of Australian Jews to the Australian government, media, and other media organisations. While AIJAC&#x27;s main focus is on combating perceived anti-Israel bias and misinformation in the media and Australian public, the organisation also has a domestic agenda that includes promoting multiculturalism, human rights and interfaith dialogue; combating extremism, fundamentalism, racism, and antisemitism; promoting Holocaust awareness; pursuing Nazi war criminals; and dealing with the security concerns of Australian Jewish communities and institutions. Besides its advocacy and lobbying activities, AIJAC has also produced regular commentary and analysis on Middle Eastern, Australian, and Asian developments. Several of AIJAC&#x27;s main activities have including a visitor program bringing international visitors to Australia and New Zealand, the &quot;Ramban Israel Fellowship&quot; program, the &quot;AIJAC Forum&quot; for young professionals, their monthly &quot;Australia/Israel Review&quot; magazine, and the &quot;Fresh Air&quot; blog and &quot;Updates&quot; email bulletin on their website.

===&quot;Australia/Israel Review&quot;===
AIJAC publishes a monthly magazine, &quot;Australia/Israel Review&quot; or AIR (formerly titled &quot;The Review&quot;), featuring articles on issues of concern to the Australian Jewish community. &quot;AIR&quot; magazine was first established by AIJAC&#x27;s predecessor, Australia-Israel Publications, in 1977 with the journalist Samp Lipski serving as its first editor. The magazine&#x27;s mission was to promote the Israeli case to Australia&#x27;s opinion makers. Copies of &quot;AIR&quot; magazine were distributed to members of both the federal and state parliaments, leading clergymen, academics, and journalists. By the late 1980s, &quot;AIR&quot; magazine had a circulation of 3,600 and had become a national publication with the establishment of a branch office in Sydney.

Although &quot;AIR&quot; magazine&#x27;s mainly focused on Israel-Palestine, the magazine also devoted considerable resources to monitoring far right figures and elements during the 1980s and 1990s such as Pauline Hanson&#x27;s One Nation, David Irving, Louis Farrakhan, and the LaRouche movement. Key contributors have included Jeremy Jones and David Greason, one of Australia&#x27;s leading experts on the far right. In 1995, &quot;AIR&quot; and its parent organisation Australia-Israel Publications were merged into AIJAC.

Despite its pro-Israel editorial standpoint, &quot;AIR&quot; magazine has published interviews with Palestinian figures such as Hanan Ashrawi, Yasser Arafat, and Nabil Shaath. In addition, the magazine has interviewed leading Israeli figures such as Benjamin Netanyahu, Moshe Arens, and Shimon Peres. In addition to its pro-Israel advocacy, &quot;AIR&quot; magazine has also taken an interest in weapons of mass destruction particularly &quot;rogue Middle East states&quot; seeking to acquire nuclear weapons capability. By 2000, &quot;AIR&quot; magazine was devoting more coverage to Australian issues and local politics.

Current and archived issues of the magazine are available on the magazine&#x27;s website, and the organisation also distributes news and alerts to subscribers by email.

===Lobbying and relationship-building===
AIJAC has lobbied and cultivated relations with the two major Australian parties, the Liberals and Australian Labor Party. AIJAC has invited politicians from both major parties on Ramban programs and dinner functions. In 2003, the Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, federal Opposition and Labor leader Simon Crean, and Labor Foreign spokesperson Kevin Rudd attended an AIJAC dinner function hosting former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. AIJAC also cultivated close relations with Prime Minister John Howard with left-wing Australian journalist Antony Loewenstein crediting the organisation with influencing the Howard government&#x27;s pro-Israel foreign policy.

AIJAC had also maintained a close relationship with Jewish Australian former Labor Member of Parliament Michael Danby, a former AIJAC staffer who has articulated a pro-Israel standpoint on several occasions. Danby was involved in the Australian Parliamentary Friends of Israel and objected to Jewish-American intellectual and dissident Noam Chomsky&#x27;s tour of Australia in 1995.

===Partnerships===
AIJAC works closely with several Australian and international Jewish organisations including the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the Zionist Federation of Australia, the various state Jewish community organisations, the Jewish National Fund, the United Israel Appeal, the World Union of Jewish Students, and the American Jewish Committee. Despite its cordial relations with mainstream Jewish groups, AIJAC disagrees with dissident Jewish peace groups like the Australian Jewish Democratic Society, which is critical of Israel and has advocated on Palestinian rights.

In May 1997, AIJAC and the American Jewish Committee established institutional ties to collaborate on key Jewish communal and international policy issues including defending the rights of Jews and other minorities, promoting friendly relations between Jews and other ethnic and religious groups, advocating for Jewish concerns in Asia and the Pacific Rim, advancing Israeli public diplomacy, combating antisemitism and Holocaust denial, and fostering ties between Israel and the Jewish Diaspora. The two organisations also collaborate in the joint sponsorship of research, conferences, symposia, exchange programs, and fact-finding missions in the Asia-Pacific region.

===Pursuit of Nazi war criminals===
In line with its interest in combating antisemitism and promoting Holocaust awareness, AIJAC has campaigned for alleged Nazi war criminals in Australia to face justice either in Australia or overseas via deportation or extradition. AIJAC has also advocated that the Australian Government re-establish a specialised war crimes investigation unit to pursue both suspects from World War II and more recent conflicts, and to assist international efforts to secure war crime justice. During the mid-1990s, AIJAC helped located the alleged Latvian war criminals Konrāds Kalējs and Karlis Ozols, who were both living in Australia. In March 2000, AIJAC also lobbied for the Australian Government to investigate Lithuanian Nazi war crimes suspect Antanas Gudelis following allegations against him aired on the Special Broadcasting Service&#x27;s &quot;Dateline&quot; program.

===Rambam Israel Fellowship Program===
In late 2003, AIJAC launched the Rambam Israel Fellowship Program to facilitate educational and fact-finding trips to Israel for selected journalists, politicians, political advisers, government officials, trade union officials, student leaders, and academics. Participation includes &quot;air/ground transport, accommodation, meals and other associated costs&quot;. According to Australian Jewish journalist Antony Loewenstein, the week-long Rambam program included meetings with prominent Israeli politicians such as Ehud Barak and Benjamin Netanyahu, a tour of the Israeli West Bank barrier, and brief meetings with Palestinian leaders in Ramallah.

The first Rambam participants were a group of young political leaders who undertook a week-long program of activities in July 2003. The second Rambam mission consisted of a five-member Coalition parliamentary delegation who visited Israel in December 2003. The third Rambam mission in February 2004 was a bipartisan parliamentary delegation consisting of Australian Labor Party Senators Stephen Conroy (Victoria), Linda Kirk (South Australia), Ursula Stephens (New South Wales), and Liberal Members of Parliament Steven Ciobo, Sophie Panopoulos, and Andrew Southcott. More recently, in 2018, Senators Stirling Griff (Centre Alliance) and Kristina Keneally (Labor) attended, along with other politicians, as well as journalists, including Sharri Markson and James Campbell.

AIJAC Rambam journalist participants have included &quot;The Herald and Weekly Times&quot; editor in chief Peter Blunden and journalist John Ferguson, the &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot; Ben Potter and Robert Bolton, &quot;The Age&quot; chief editorial writer John Watson, &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot; Dennis Atkins, the Special Broadcasting Service&#x27;s Sally Watson, the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; Louise Dodson, and Channel Ten&#x27;s John Hill.

==Criticism==
===Palestinian Authority===
According to Reich, Palestinian Authority officials have expressed criticism of AIJAC&#x27;s pro-Israel advocacy work and media management. The-then Head of the General Palestinian Delegation to Australia Ali Kazak alleged that AIJAC tried to prevent factual reporting by the Australian media on the Israel-Palestine conflict. Kazak was particularly critical of an AIJAC report criticising the Australian public broadcaster Special Broadcasting Service (SBS), which he claimed tried to suppress what he referred to as &quot;Israel&#x27;s internationally condemned bloody occupation, violations and war crimes committed on a daily basis against the defenceless Palestinian people on the pretext that such coverage is pro-Palestinian&quot;.

===Arab Australians===
AIJAC has also clashed with local Arab Australian community organisations and media. Executive Director Rubenstein criticised local Arab community groups for alleged hypocrisy in opposing the introduction of the Racial Vilification Act but being the first to use it. He also alleged that local Arabic newspapers and programs promoted extremism.

In November 1995, the Australian Arabic Council (ACC) lodged a complaint against AIJAC&#x27;s predecessor organisation Australia-Israel Publications after a staff member named David Pryce-Jones remarked that it was an Arab habit to assassinate prime ministers in response to the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by Israeli ultranationalist Yigal Amir. In response, the ACC lodged official complaints against AIP and the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; with the Australian Press Council and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. In December 1997, the AIP published a public apology in the &quot;Herald Sun&quot;.

===Journalists===
AIJAC has received criticism for allegedly serving as a pro-Israel lobby group in Australian politics and the media. Left-wing Australian Jewish journalist Antony Loewenstein has criticised AIJAC for promoting a binary view that Israel is committed to seeking peace and that the Palestinians have spurned opportunities for peace, claiming that AIJAC dislikes or distrusts Arabs and Palestinians. Loewenstein has also criticised AIJAC for lobbying the two Australian public broadcasters, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and SBS to conform to a pro-Israel, pro-American, and anti-Arab agenda under the pretext of ensuring balance. Loewenstein has alleged that AIJAC has used the media complaints process to harass ABC and SBS reporters and senior management over their coverage of the First Gulf War, the Battle of Jenin, and the Israel-Palestine conflict. According to Loewenstein, AIJAC has also blocked the airing of documentaries and films sympathetic to the Palestinians such as Hany Abu-Assad&#x27;s &quot;Ford Transit&quot;, Yoav Shamir&#x27;s &quot;Checkpoint&quot;, and Simone Bitton&#x27;s &quot;The Wall&quot;. Loewenstein blamed AIJAC&#x27;s lobbying campaigns for demoralising journalists, contributing to staff departures, and low morale. He has likened AIJAC&#x27;s media monitoring activities to that of other pro-Israel watchdogs including HonestReporting and the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America. In response, AIJAC analyst Ted Larkin criticised Loewenstein&#x27;s book &quot;My Israel Question&quot; for alleged factual inaccuracies and glossing over the Palestine Liberation Organization&#x27;s support for Saddam Hussein and Palestinian suicide bombing.

Similarly, senior ABC News and former &quot;The Australian&quot; journalist John Lyons has criticised AIJAC for favouring pro-Israel journalists while attacking journalists whose reports and stories they did not agree with. Lyons has alleged that critical journalists have received abuse on social media. Lyons cites an attempt by AIJAC to discredit a story that he had published in the &quot;Weekend Australian&quot; highlighting the plight of a Palestinian travel agent named Nasser Jaber who had been evicted from their home in Jerusalem. According to Lyons, AIJAC was supported in this episode by the Israeli Embassy in Canberra and the &quot;Australian Jewish News&quot;. Lyons has also claimed that AIJAC tried to sabotage his career as &quot;The Australian&quot; Jerusalem correspondent by trying to discredit his news reports. He has also criticised AIJAC for pushing Australian foreign policy in a pro-Israel direction. In response, &quot;AIR&quot; magazine editor Tzvi Fleischer has defended AIJAC&#x27;s criticisms of Lyons&#x27; media reports, alleging that he had an anti-Israel bias. AIJAC senior policy analyst Ahron Shapiro also criticised Lyons&#x27; memoir &quot;Balcony Over Jerusalem&quot; for promoting what he regarded as a distorted, negative image of Israel.

===Politicians===
Former Premier of New South Wales and Australian Foreign Minister Bob Carr has criticised AIJAC and pro-Israel elements within the Gillard government for exerting an unhealthy influence on Australian foreign policy towards Israel and the Palestinian Territories in his 2014 memoir &quot;Diary of a Foreign Minister&quot;; contending that it hurt Australia&#x27;s relations with the Arab-Muslim world. Carr also clashed with Prime Minister Julia Gillard on Israel, at one point threatening to resign unless Gillard dropped Australia&#x27;s opposition to Palestinian efforts to upgrade their United Nations membership to non-member observer status.

In response to Carr&#x27;s criticisms, AIJAC National Chairman Mark Leibler defended the group&#x27;s efforts to lobby Australian Prime Ministers and rejected Carr&#x27;s claims of a powerful pro-Israel lobby as a &quot;figment of his imagination&quot;. Leibler also rejected Carr&#x27;s claims that AIJAC took an extreme right wing view of Israel and reiterated AIJAC&#x27;s commitment to a two-state solution. AIJAC policy analyst Ahron Shapiro also criticised Carr for attempting to downgrade Australia&#x27;s relations with Israel. By contrast, Loewenstein has praised Carr for challenging AIJAC, alleging that AIJAC&#x27;s lobbying activities and Ramban trips promoted a negative view of Palestinians and isolated Australia in international community.

<text>Austin H. Gunsel (April 2, 1909 - June 17, 1974) was the interim Commissioner of the National Football League from 1959 to 1960, following the death of Bert Bell on October 11, 1959.

== Education ==
Gunsel was born in Irvington, New Jersey and is a graduate of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

== Career ==
Gunsel joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1939. He served as both J. Edgar Hoover&#x27;s administrative assistant and as a special agent for the Bureau, and during his crime-fighting career, served in the New York City, Detroit and Chicago field offices.

In 1952, Gunsel was hired by the NFL to head the league&#x27;s investigative department, a move made in response to commissioner Bert Bell&#x27;s fear of a scandal damaging the league&#x27;s image. Gunsel became league treasurer in 1956, holding the post until his retirement ten years later. He served as acting president of the NFL after Bell&#x27;s death in October 1959.

Gunsel and San Francisco 49ers attorney Marshall Leahy were seen as the front-runners commissioner. On January 20, 1960, Leahy received 7 votes to Gunsel&#x27;s 5, which was short of the two-thirds needed to be elected commissioner. Gunsel was soon dropped from consideration and after an eight-day deadlock, the owners selected Los Angeles Rams general manager Pete Rozelle as a compromise candidate. Gunsel stayed on as NFL treasurer until his retirement on July 1, 1966.

== Personal life ==
At the age of 65, Gunsel died at Lankenau Hospital in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania.

<doc id="559554" wikidata="Q4710841" url="?curid=559554" title="Yellow Line (Washington Metro)">
<text>The Yellow Line is a rapid transit line of the Washington Metro system that runs between in Virginia and in Washington, D.C. It consists of 13 stations in Fairfax County, the city of Alexandria, and Arlington County in Virginia, and Washington, D.C. It is the shortest line in the system, and since its truncation to Mount Vernon Square, it is the only line that does not enter Maryland.

The Yellow Line shares track with the Blue Line between and and the Green Line between and Mount Vernon Square. It has only two stations that are not shared by any other lines (Huntington and ) and only two sections of track that are not shared by any other lines – the section south of King Street–Old Town and the section between and , crossing the Potomac River.

On weekdays, trains run every 6 minutes until 9:30PM and every 7.5 minutes afterward. On weekends, trains run every 8 minutes.

== History ==
Planning for Metro began with the Mass Transportation Survey in 1955, which attempted to forecast freeway and mass transit systems sufficient to meet the region&#x27;s needs projected for 1980. In 1959, the study&#x27;s final report included two rapid transit lines that anticipated downtown Washington subways. Because the plan called for extensive freeway construction within the District of Columbia, alarmed residents lobbied for federal legislation creating a regional transportation agency with a moratorium on freeway construction through July 1, 1962. The new agency, the National Capital Transportation Administration, issued a 1962 &quot;Transportation in the National Capital Region&quot; report, which did not include the route that became the Yellow Line. A central route under 7th Street in downtown was only added in 1967 primarily to serve the &quot;inner city&quot;. In March 1968, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) board approved its Adopted Regional System (ARS), which included the Yellow Line from Franconia and Backlick Road (in Springfield) to Greenbelt.

While a cut-and-fill tunnel for Yellow Line was built under 7th Street and U Street, street traffic and pedestrian access were difficult. The result was the loss of the traditional retail businesses along the route. The downtown segment of the line was originally projected to open in September 1977. Obtaining approval of the District of Columbia and Prince Georges&#x27; County of the exact alignment of the Yellow Line north of U Street delayed construction. Originally, the ARS called for the line to be placed in the median strip of the planned North Central Freeway. Still, after that road was canceled, the route of the replacement subway tunnel became controversial, resulting in years of expensive delays.

Service on the Yellow Line began on April 30, 1983, adding to the system and linking the two already-built stations of and with a bridge across the Potomac River. It was extended beyond by four stations to on December 17, 1983, the first station outside the Capital Beltway. When the Green Line link to opened on May 11, 1991, it acted as an extension of the Yellow Line until the southern Green Line branch was completed. When Green Line service began, the Yellow Line was truncated at , where a pocket track exists to relay trains.

The Yellow Line was initially planned to follow a slightly different route in Virginia. The plan would have sent Yellow Line trains to , with Blue Line trains serving Huntington. This was changed due to a shortage of rail cars at the time of the completion of the line to Huntington. Because fewer rail cars were required to operate Yellow Line service than would be required to run Blue Line service out to Huntington, the line designations were switched due to the Yellow Line&#x27;s shorter route. From 1999 to 2008, the Yellow Line operated to Franconia–Springfield on July 4, as part of Metro&#x27;s special service pattern on that day.
In 1998, Congress changed the name of the Washington National Airport to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, with the law specifying that no money be spent to implement the name change. As a result, WMATA did not change the name of the National Airport station (which never included the full name of the airport). In response to repeated inquiries from Republican congressmen that the station be renamed, WMATA stated that stations are renamed only at the request of the local jurisdiction. Because Democrats controlled both Arlington County and the District of Columbia, the name change was blocked. Finally, in 2001, Congress made changing the station&#x27;s name a condition of further federal funding.

In May 2018, Metro announced an extensive renovation of platforms at twenty stations across the system. To accommodate these platform reconstructions, the Blue and Yellow Lines south of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport would be closed from May 25 to September 8, 2019, in the longest line closure in Metro&#x27;s history. As a result, all Yellow and Blue line services terminated at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport during the closure.

From March 26, 2020, until June 28, 2020, trains were bypassing , , , and stations due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. All stations were reopened beginning on June 28, 2020.

Between February 13 and May 13, 2021, additional Yellow Line trains began operating between Mount Vernon Square and at all times, replacing the Blue Line due to it being suspended because of platform reconstruction at and .

Between May 29 and September 6, 2021, all Yellow Line trains terminated at due to the platform improvement project, which closed stations north of . Shuttle buses were provided to the closed stations while Green Line service replaced service between Mount Vernon Square and Fort Totten.

On June 15, 2022, WMATA announced that all Yellow Line trains will be suspended from September 10, 2022, to May 7, 2023, to tie in the completion of Potomac Yard station and to rehab the 14th Street Bridge the Yellow Line operates over. Service will be replaced by additional Green Line trains, as well as Blue Line trains that will operate between and stations. On April 4, 2023, WMATA announced they will re-open the Yellow Line on May 7, 2023. The Yellow Line reopened on May 7, 2023, with its northeastern terminus cut back from to .

On November 16, 1995, WMATA and the developer of the Potomac Yard area of Alexandria, Virginia, signed an agreement to construct a new station between Braddock Road and National Airport that the developer will finance. The Federal Transit Administration, in cooperation with WMATA, the National Park Service and The City of Alexandria government, completed an environmental impact statement for the project in June 2016. The station opened on May 19, 2023.

=== Extensions ===

In 2006, Metro board member Jim Graham and Washington, D.C. Mayor Anthony A. Williams proposed re-extending Yellow Line service to or even to . Their proposal did not involve constructing any new track because either extension would run along the same route as the existing Green Line, thus relieving crowding on that line and would require fewer switches to maintain making operations easier. Suburban members of the board initially resisted the proposal. Through a compromise that also increased service on the Red Line, on April 20, 2006, the WMATA board approved a Yellow Line extension to the Fort Totten station during off-peak hours. An 18-month pilot program began on December 31, 2006, at a cost of $5.75 million to the District of Columbia. On June 26, 2008, due to the success of the 18-month trial, the Yellow Line was permanently extended to operate up to the Fort Totten Metro Station at all other times other than during weekday rush hour/peak commuter periods.

As part of the Rush Plus initiative trial, additional Yellow Line trains began running between Greenbelt and Franconia-Springfield starting June 18, 2012; these trains were discontinued on June 25, 2017, due to budget cuts. From May 25, 2019, to September 10, 2022, the Yellow Line returned to Greenbelt, this time serving the station at all hours. On May 7, 2023, Yellow Line trains were shortened to Mount Vernon Square at all times being replaced by additional Green Line trains.

== Route ==

The southern terminus of the Yellow Line is adjacent to Kings Highway (Virginia State Route 241) in Fairfax County, Virginia. The line heads northeast on a bridge over Hunting Creek and the Capital Beltway to a station just south of Eisenhower Avenue, which serves several government office buildings, including the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The Yellow Line then merges with the Blue Line and follows the right-of-way of the RF&amp;P Railroad through the City of Alexandria. The line enters a short tunnel under U.S. Route 1. After crossing a bridge over Four Mile Run, the line enters Arlington County on an elevated structure above the National Airport parking lots. 

At the north end of the airport, the Yellow Line enters a tunnel under 18th Street South and South Hayes Street in Crystal City. The tunnel continues along the southwest face of the Pentagon which is a 2-level station to facilitate a fork with the Blue Line. After the Pentagon station, the Yellow Line emerges from its tunnel east of the Pentagon and crosses the Charles R. Fenwick Bridge over the George Washington Memorial Parkway, the Potomac River, and Ohio Drive. At the end of the bridge, the Yellow Line re-enters a tunnel near the Jefferson Memorial and crosses under the Washington Channel. The tunnel merges with the Green Line tunnel under 7th Street Southwest just south of the L&#x27;Enfant Plaza. The joint Yellow—Green Line tunnel continues north through downtown Washington under 7th Street, turns west under Florida Avenue and U Street, and then north under 14th Street Northwest. The tunnel then turns toward the northeast under Park Road and New Hampshire Avenue. The tunnel then bends eastward under Rock Creek Cemetery and Fort Totten Park to emerge just before entering the lower level of the Fort Totten station. Until May 2019, this was the northern terminal for Yellow Line service, with the track continuing northeast as just the Green Line to the Greenbelt terminus. Between May 2019 and September 2022, the Yellow Line continued along these tracks to Greenbelt.

Internally, the Yellow Line in Virginia is called the &quot;Huntington Route&quot; (C) and the route through the District of Columbia and beyond to Greenbelt as the &quot;Greenbelt Route&quot; (E). The line&#x27;s bridge over the Potomac River is called the L Route. As of March 2018, all Yellow Line trains are required only to run 8-car trains.

== Stations ==
The following stations are along the line, from south to north.

== Future ==
A second improvement project involves building a pedestrian tunnel to interconnect the Gallery Place station with Metro Center. A July 2005 study proposed connecting the eastern mezzanine of Metro Center with the western mezzanine of Gallery Place that are only one block apart. The proposed connection would reduce the number of passengers that use the Red Line to transfer between the Yellow Line and the Blue and Orange lines at Metro Center. As of 2011, the project remained unfunded.

<doc id="559559" wikidata="Q986407" url="?curid=559559" title="Living Stream Ministry">
<text>Living Stream Ministry (LSM), originally named Stream Publishers when founded in 1965 by Witness Lee, is a non-profit corporation currently based in Anaheim, California. LSM publishes the works of Watchman Nee and Witness Lee, including the Recovery Version of the Bible. LSM has been a member of the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association since 2002 and of the Christian Booksellers Association since 1981.

==Statement of Faith==

LSM holds to the following statement of faith:

 Holding the Bible as the complete and only divine revelation, we strongly believe that God is eternally one and also eternally the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the three being distinct but not separate. We hold that Christ is both the complete God and the perfect man. Without abandoning His divinity, He was conceived in the womb of a human virgin, lived a genuine human life on earth, and died a vicarious and all-inclusive death on the cross. After three days He resurrected bodily and has ascended to the heavens. He is now in glory, fully God but still fully man. We look to His imminent return with the kingdom of God, by which He will reign over the earth in the millennium and in eternity. We confess that the third of the Trinity, the Spirit, is equally God. All that the Father has and is, is expressed by the Son; and all that the Son has and is, is realized as the Spirit. We further believe that mankind is in need of God&#x27;s salvation. Though we were absolutely unable to fulfill the heavy demands of God&#x27;s righteousness, holiness, and glory, Christ fulfilled all the requirements through His death on the cross. Because of Christ&#x27;s death, God has forgiven us of our sins, justified us by making Christ our righteousness and reconciled us to Himself. Based on Christ&#x27;s redemption, God regenerates the redeemed with His Spirit to consummate His salvation, that they may become His children. Now possessing God&#x27;s life and nature, the believers enjoy a daily salvation in His Body in this age and the eternal salvation in the coming age and in eternity. In eternity we will dwell with God as the New Jerusalem, the consummation of God&#x27;s salvation of His elect.

==Activities==

Living Stream Ministry publishes the works of Watchman Nee and Witness Lee, providing the authoritative and definitive collections. The writings of Watchman Nee and Witness Lee focus on the enjoyment of the divine life and on the building up of the Body of Christ. Its purpose is to promote the teachings of Watchman Nee and Witness Lee, and to prepare, select, and distribute information of all kinds which may be useful for the growth of spiritual life among Christians.

Living Stream Ministry publishes and prepares video tapes, audio tapes, and printed spiritual materials intended for all Christians worldwide. LSM also supports radio programs such as &quot;The Life-Study of the Bible&quot;, a thirty-minute radio program composed of excerpts from the works of Witness Lee. This program, which began production in 1996, is currently broadcast in three languages to more than 100 radio stations. LSM also conducts and hosts various conferences and trainings throughout the year, including the Full Time Training in Anaheim (FTTA). It also operates the Anaheim Palms Telecom Center and donates funds to local churches and affiliated organizations.

==One publication==

In 2005, Living Stream Ministry published a booklet on behalf of the co-workers among the local churches called &quot;Publication Work in the Lord&#x27;s Recovery&quot;. The booklet stated that only publications carried out under the collective oversight of the co-workers should be used in the local churches. Seeking to restrict the churches from using any other material in a widespread way, it discouraged all members from carrying out private publication works. The booklet also stated that this was not a mandate and that &quot;the one publication should not become the basis of our accepting or rejecting any persons in the communion of faith or in the fellowship of the churches; it should not be insisted on as an item of the faith. If any are not inclined to be restricted in one publication, these ones are still our brothers; they are still in the genuine local churches.&quot; The booklet also states, &quot;There is nearly no item of life or light that has not been covered by our publications&quot; and describes the benefit of other publications in this way: &quot;...the fact that these publications can be produced and distributed should not give them any more credence among the churches than anything else that can be published today, secular or religious. These are simply other publications that our brothers and sisters may or may not be interested in. They are not part of the one publication in the Lord’s recovery, and they are not necessarily beneficial to the spiritual good of the saints among us.&quot;

<doc id="559560" wikidata="Q7285181" url="?curid=559560" title="Raisio Group">
<text>Raisio Oyj, known internationally as Raisio Group, is a Finnish company specialised in healthy, responsibly produced food and ingredients.

Raisio Group&#x27;s well-known international brands are Benecol and Elovena.

Benecol foods were launched in Finland in 1995 as part of major public health initiative to lower the nation&#x27;s cholesterol. Two decades later Benecol product range has grown to include spreads, yogurts and yogurt drinks trusted by millions around the world.

In 2023, the Group&#x27;s net sales totalled EUR 220 million and comparable EBIT was EUR 23 million. Raisio employs some 350 persons. Raisio&#x27;s production plants are located in Finland and the company has operations in ten countries. The Group&#x27;s headquarters is in Raisio, Western Finland. The key markets of Benecol products are Finland, the UK, Poland, Ireland and Belgium.

In 2004, the company divested its paper chemical division, Raisio Chemicals, to Ciba Specialty Chemicals. In 2009, Raisio sold its margarine business to Bunge Limited. Raisio Group acquired the British food company Glisten in 2010. The next year, Raisio acquired Big Bear. In November 2014 Raisio acquired the Benecol business from the affiliates of Johnson &amp; Johnson in the UK, Ireland and Belgium and amended the agreement on the Northern American markets of Benecol. In 2016 Raisio divested its snack bar business in the UK.

The main target for 2007 was to improve profitability through streamlining, focusing and enhancing operations. Hereby Raisio divested its food potato and diagnostics businesses and carried through several minor structural changes. Raisio and its partner McNeil signed an agreement that returned Benecol rights to Raisio. The company divested its confectionery business in the end of 2017 and the cattle feed business in 2018. The strategy 2022–2025 has a clear focus on healthy, responsibly produced food. In 2021, Raisio acquired the Finnish company Verso Food Oy and published a new strategy for 2022–2025. The strategy is based on three focus areas: Benecol products and plant stanol ester solutions, oat-based consumer products and oats as an industrial raw material, and plant-based food.

<doc id="559561" wikidata="Q6605173" url="?curid=559561" title="List of aircraft wings of the Royal Navy">
<text>This is a list of Royal Navy, Fleet Air Arm, Naval Air [[Wing (military aviation unit)|Wing]]s. A Wing designation consisted a number to differentiate each one and a simple label for the role of the wing. Each wing was formed of a small number of Naval Air Squadrons and were mostly either a fighter wing or a torpedo, bomber and reconnaissance wing, and there included a proposed MAC ship (Merchant Aircraft Carrier) wing.

== Naval Air Wings ==

The Fleet Air Arm squadrons, embarked on the Fleet and Light Fleet aircraft carriers, were grouped into explicit Wings from June 1943. Due to the existing Royal Air Force Wings having the same number designation, each Fleet Air Arm Wing contained the word Naval in its title. The Wings were each allocated a unique number and the name of each wing also contained the designated wings role. There were two significant roles with each wing being either a Fighter wing or a Torpedo Bomber Reconnaissance wing, with the latter known as a TBR wing.

From 25 October 1943 some of the Naval Air Wings started to form. Of the Naval Air Wings which the Fleet Air Arm planned to form up, these were never all realised. Those Naval Air Wings which were serving within the British Pacific Fleet were placed into new Carrier Air Groups, effectively disbanding them, to align with US Navy policy, this once the Second World War in Europe had ended, to support Allied operations in the Pacific War against the Japanese in 1945.

<doc id="559565" wikidata="Q718303" url="?curid=559565" title="Morten Andersen">
<text>Morten Andersen (born 19 August 1960), nicknamed &quot;the Great Dane&quot;, is a Danish-American former professional football kicker who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 25 seasons, most notably with the New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons. Following a career from 1982 to 2007, Andersen holds the NFL record for regular season games played at 382. He also ranks second in field goals (565) and points scored (2,544). In addition to his league accomplishments, he is the Saints all-time leading scorer at 1,318 points. Andersen was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2017. Along with Jan Stenerud, he is one of only two exclusive kickers to receive the honor.

==Early life==
Andersen was born in Copenhagen and raised in the west Jutland town of Struer. As a student, he was a gymnast and a long jumper, and just missed becoming a member of the Danish junior national soccer team. He visited the United States in 1977 as a Youth For Understanding exchange student. He first kicked an American football on a whim at Ben Davis High School in Indianapolis. He was so impressive in his one season of high school football that he was given a scholarship to Michigan State University.

Andersen, with his left leg as his dominant kicking leg, starred at Michigan State, setting several records, including a Big Ten Conference record 63-yard field goal against Ohio State University. He was named an All-American in 1981. His success landed him the kicking job with the New Orleans Saints. On 24 September 2011, he was inducted into the Michigan State University Athletics Hall of Fame.

==Professional football career==

=== New Orleans Saints, 1982–1994 ===
Andersen&#x27;s NFL career got off to a rocky start. On his first NFL kickoff to start the strike-shortened 1982 season, Andersen twisted his ankle and missed eight weeks of the season. Despite the early setback, he soon emerged as one of the strongest and most reliable placekickers in the NFL. In his years with the Saints, he was named to six Pro Bowls, kicked 302 field goals, and scored 1318 points. In 1991, against Chicago, Andersen kicked a 60-yard field goal, tying him with Steve Cox for the second-longest field goal in league history at the time, behind 63-yard record-holder kicked by Tom Dempsey. Andersen&#x27;s kick has since been matched by Rob Bironas, Dan Carpenter and Greg Zuerlein, and surpassed by Sebastian Janikowski (twice), Jason Elam, Justin Tucker, Jay Feely, Matt Bryant, David Akers, Matt Prater, Jake Elliott, Graham Gano, Brett Maher, Brandon Aubrey and Stephen Gostkowski. Andersen&#x27;s proficiency with field goal kicking earned him the nickname &quot;Mr. Automatic.&quot; Following the 1994 season, he was released by the Saints for salary cap purposes and because his accuracy had started to decline.

=== Atlanta Falcons, 1995–2000 ===
Following his release by the Saints, Andersen signed with the Atlanta Falcons. He silenced those who felt him to be washed up and was once again named a Pro Bowler during his time in Atlanta. In December 1995 against the Saints, he became the first player in NFL history to kick three field goals of over 50 yards in a single game.

In Week 17 of the 1996 season, Andersen missed a 30-yard field goal that enabled the Jacksonville Jaguars to make the playoffs. Two years later, he kicked a game-winning field goal in overtime in the 1998 NFC Championship Game to beat the Minnesota Vikings and send the Falcons to their first-ever Super Bowl appearance, falling to the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXIII.

There are a number of interesting coincidences between Andersen and former NFL placekicker Gary Anderson. Anderson and Andersen have nearly identical last names, were born within a year of one another outside the United States (Anderson was born in South Africa), came to the United States as teenagers, were both drafted in 1982, had long and successful NFL careers throughout the 1980s and 1990s (and both retiring in the 2000s decade), and hold first or second place in a number of NFL records for scoring, field goals, and longevity. Their overall accuracy is also nearly identical; their career percentage being within .5% of each other on both FGs and PATs. Also, Anderson missed a field goal in the 1998 NFC Championship Game for the Minnesota Vikings before Andersen kicked his winning kick, both from the same distance as well (38 yards).

=== Intermittent years, 2001–2004 ===
Andersen went on to play with the New York Giants for the 2001 season, followed by the Kansas City Chiefs the following two seasons. In the 2004 offseason, Andersen was beaten out for the kicking job by rookie Lawrence Tynes. He was released by the Chiefs for the final roster cut, and was subsequently signed by the Vikings. Although his leg strength had declined greatly with age, he continued to prove himself accurate for field goals. Having not been signed by a team following the 2004 season, he became a free agent and did not play in 2005. He announced NFL Europe games in the 2005 season.

=== Atlanta Falcons, 2006–2007 ===
In January 2006, Andersen was inducted as the first member of the Danish American Football Federation Hall of Fame. Later that year, Andersen returned to the NFL, re-signing with the Atlanta Falcons; Andersen was brought in to help Michael Koenen, who was at the time performing double duty as punter and kicker (an extremely rare occurrence in the NFL) missing several field goals in that capacity, and Koenen reverted to strictly punting after Andersen&#x27;s signing. His first game back was against his former team, the Saints, on Monday Night Football. The game was the first game in the Louisiana Superdome since Hurricane Katrina prevented its use for the entire 2005 regular season. Andersen scored the only Falcon points with a 26-yard field goal in the first quarter. In his second game back, Andersen made 5 of 5 field goals (matching his career-best for the ninth time), as well as both extra-point attempts. He was named NFC special teams player of the week, becoming the oldest player to earn the honor since the award was first introduced in 1984. He is the team record holder in points for the New Orleans Saints.

On 16 December 2006, Andersen passed Gary Anderson to become the all-time leading scorer in NFL history. The following weekend, 24 December 2006, Andersen again passed Anderson to become the NFL&#x27;s career leader in field goals made. On 17 September 2007, he again signed with the Falcons in an attempt to secure their unreliable kicking game. By the end of the regular season, he had made 25 of 28 field goals (89.3%), the most accurate season of his career.

=== Retirement and legacy ===
In the 2008 season, Andersen did not receive a contract offer from any team, but waited until 8 December to officially retire. Andersen had stated that his goal was to be the first NFL player to play until he turned 50 in 2010. However, he retired just two days after he would have become the oldest player ever to appear in an NFL game, had he played on or after 6 December he would have been the oldest NFL player to play. The record held by George Blanda still stands – Blanda played in his last NFL game on 4 January 1976 (the 1975 AFC Championship) at the age of .

On 6 November 2009, Andersen was inducted into the New Orleans Saints Hall of Fame. On 25 June 2011, Andersen was inducted into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame. On 10 August 2013, Andersen was inducted into the Greater New Orleans Sports Hall of Fame. On 21 December 2015, he was inducted as the fourth member of the team&#x27;s Ring of Honor. On 4 February 2017, it was announced that Andersen would be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

On 10 September 2020, he launched a new weekly football podcast with the VegasInsider Podcast Network titled &quot;Great Dane Nation&quot; with co-host Tom &quot;FreezePops&quot; Carroll.
