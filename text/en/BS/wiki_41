<text>Q1 Tower (an abbreviation of Queensland Number One) is a supertall skyscraper in Queensland, Australia. The residential tower on the Gold Coast was the world&#x27;s tallest residential building from 2005 to 2011. It is the tallest building in Australia, the second tallest building in the Southern Hemisphere, and the third-tallest free-standing structure in the Southern Hemisphere, behind the Autograph Tower in Jakarta, Indonesia, and the Sky Tower in Auckland, New Zealand. The Q1 officially opened in November 2005.

The landmark building was recognised as one of Queensland&#x27;s icons during the state&#x27;s 150th-birthday celebrations.

==Design and construction==

Q1 Tower was designed by SDG &amp; The Buchan Group, and its form was inspired by the Sydney 2000 Olympic torch and the Sydney Opera House. The name was given in honour of members of Australia’s Olympic sculling team of the 1920s – Q1.

The concept was based on studies of wind, movement and tension, in which a series of ribbons wrap concentrically around the tower’s exterior and hover above the entry plaza area, providing cover and shade. The tension in the movement and free form are expressed by the gradual twisting of the aluminium-clad ribbons as they move around the building. The result is an open-air galleria-like shopping precinct under the glazed ribbon structure and a curved retail façade to the street edges.

The project was developed by The Sunland Group and built by Sunland Constructions. The building was the Silver Award winner of the 2005 Emporis Skyscraper Award, coming in second to Turning Torso in Sweden.

Q1 was completed towards the end of 2005. Its main point of difference to other high-rise buildings in Surfers Paradise is its glass-enclosed sleek look. Q1&#x27;s lift lobby is separated into two high-speed lift groups. Four high-speed lifts going 5.0 m/s service levels B2 to level 42. Three separate high-speed lifts going 8.0 m/s service levels 43 to the penthouse on level 74.

The building is supported by 26 piles, each in diameter, that extend into the ground passing through up to of solid rock. Q1 contains one-, two- and three-bedroom units. Building facilities include two lagoon swimming pools, a lap pool, gymnasium, small theatre, a ballroom and a spa centre.

An application to construct a walkway around the outside of level 78 was lodged with the Gold Coast City Council in mid-2010.

==Height==
At and with a roof height of , Q1 qualifies as the world&#x27;s 17th tallest all-residential building when measured to the top of its structural point (spire), but is ranked lower behind buildings including Melbourne&#x27;s Australia 108 (roof height of ) and the Eureka Tower (roof height of ) when measured to its roof height and highest inhabitable floor. However, according to the ranking system developed by the U.S.-based Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, the main criterion by which buildings are ranked is the height of the top of the spire, qualifying Q1 as the taller.

When the Q1 was completed, it overtook the 21st Century Tower in Dubai, United Arab Emirates to become the world&#x27;s tallest residential tower. When measured to its structural point, it dwarfs the Gold Coast skyline, with the closest buildings to Q1&#x27;s height being the North Tower of Circle on Cavill and the Soul building.

== Awards ==
In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, Q1 was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a &quot;structure and engineering feat&quot;.

==Observation deck==
SkyPoint, formerly known as QDeck, is an observation deck at levels 77 and 78. It is Australia&#x27;s only beachside observation deck and has room for 400 people. It is above the Surfers Paradise beach, giving the public a 360-degree view of Brisbane to the north, the Gold Coast hinterland to the west, Byron Bay, New South Wales, to the south and the Pacific Ocean to the east. The express elevator to the observation deck travels the 77 floors in 43 seconds, for a speed of 9.0 m/s.

==Building condition==

In 2009, reports of disrepair and poor building conditions emerged. Peeling paint which has revealed rusty steel inside and outside, as well as shattered glass panels are amongst the visible concerns. The Building Services Authority has confirmed it has received complaints in relation to the building. The north stairwell was assessed as defective due to the stairwell pressurisation system not meeting the minimum air-flow requirements during a fire emergency. The Building Services Authority asked Q1&#x27;s builders to rectify the problem in July 2010.

==Events==
Q1 has been used as a fireworks launch site during New Year&#x27;s Eve celebrations.
The building is one of the most popular destinations for students celebrating schoolies week, despite the body corporate committee treasurer&#x27;s claims that most of the building&#x27;s unit owners were opposed to their stay.

On 28 March 2007, two BASE jumpers made an early-morning illegal jump from a northern side apartment. The skydivers pleaded guilty in the Southport Magistrates&#x27; Court and were fined A$750 without a conviction being recorded.

At , the SkyPoint Climb at Q1 is Australia’s highest external building climb.
Q1 has been holding an annual Stair Climb event for a number of years.

<doc id="545100" wikidata="Q1876418" url="?curid=545100" title="Association of Zoos and Aquariums">
<text>The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), originally the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums (AAZPA), is an American 501(c)(3) 
nonprofit organization founded in 1924 and dedicated to the advancement of zoos and public aquariums in the areas of conservation, education, science, and recreation. AZA is headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland, and accredits zoos. There were 238 accredited facilities as of 2019, primarily in the US, and also a handful in eleven other countries.

== History ==
In October 1924 the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums was formed as an affiliate of the American Institute of Park Executives. In 1966, the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums became a professional branch affiliate of the newly formed National Recreation and Park Association, which absorbed the American Institute of Park Executives.

In the fall of 1971, the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums membership voted to become an independent association. On January 19, 1972, it was chartered as the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums with its executive office located in Wheeling, West Virginia, within the Oglebay Park Good Zoo. In 1994, the shorter name American Zoo and Aquarium Association (AZA) was adopted.

In early 2018, AZA acquired the Wildlife Trafficking Alliance to help grow public awareness about the purchase and sale of illegal wildlife products in the United States.

The Association of Zoos and Aquariums reported 195 million visitors to its 236 accredited member facilities in 2017.

==Activities==
The organization is active in institution accreditation, animal care initiatives, education and conservation programs, collaborative research and advocacy.

AZA serves as an accrediting body for zoos and aquariums and ensures accredited facilities meet higher standards of animal care than required by law. Institutions are evaluated every five years in order to ensure standards are met and to maintain accreditation. As of 2019 AZA had 238 accredited facilities in the US and eleven other countries: Canada, Mexico, Bermuda, The Bahamas, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Argentina, Spain, Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Korea.

Approximately 800,000 animals representing 6,000 species are in the care of AZA-accredited facilities, including 1,000 threatened or endangered species. The association also facilitates both species survival plans and population management plans, which serve to sustainably manage genetically diverse captive populations of various animal species.

AZA holds a conference in September, one of the largest zoo and aquarium professionals&#x27; events in the US.

AZA also manages the citizen science program FrogWatch USA.

== Accreditation ==
In the United States, any public animal exhibit must be licensed and inspected by the United States Department of Agriculture, United States Environmental Protection Agency, Drug Enforcement Administration, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and others. Depending on the animals they exhibit, the activities of zoos are regulated by laws including the Endangered Species Act, the Animal Welfare Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 and others. Additionally, zoos in North America may choose to pursue accreditation by AZA.

The American association has developed a definition for zoological gardens and aquariums as part of its accreditation standards: &quot;A permanent cultural institution which owns and maintains captive wild animals that represent more than a token collection and, under the direction of a professional staff, provides its collection with appropriate care and exhibits them in an aesthetic manner to the public on a regularly scheduled basis. They shall further be defined as having as their primary business the exhibition, conservation and preservation of the earth&#x27;s fauna in an educational and scientific manner.&quot;

To achieve accreditation, a zoo must pass an application and inspection process and meet or exceed AZA&#x27;s standards for animal health and welfare, fundraising, zoo staffing, and involvement in global conservation efforts. Inspection is performed by three experts (typically one veterinarian, one expert in animal care, and one expert in zoo management and operations) and then reviewed by a panel of twelve experts before accreditation is awarded. This accreditation process is repeated once every five years.

AZA estimates that there are approximately 2,800 animal exhibits operating under USDA license as of 2019; fewer than 10% are accredited. Certification is possible for facilities that hold animals, but are not regularly open to the public.

== Saving Animals From Extinction ==
AZA&#x27;s Saving Animals From Extinction (SAFE) program prioritizes collaboration between zoos and aquariums to support highly vulnerable species. SAFE builds on existing recovery plans to implement strategic conservation and public engagement activities. In 2017, AZA member zoos and aquariums invested $15.6 million towards SAFE program species.

The SAFE program signature species include the African lion, African species of vultures, Asian elephant, Atlantic &quot;Acropora&quot; coral, black-footed ferret, black rhinoceros, cheetah, eastern indigo snake, giraffe, gorilla, sea turtles, orangutan, radiated tortoise, red wolf, sharks and sting rays, vaquita, western pond turtle, and whooping crane. There were more than 20 species or taxonomic groups included in the program as of 2019.

== Annual Report on Conservation and Science ==
The association has a computerized database called the &quot;Annual Report on Conservation and Science&quot;. This helps track AZA research projects worldwide.

AZA member zoos and aquariums contribute $220 million to conservation projects each year. They participate in 115 reintroduction programs, including more than 40 programs for species listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act.

In 2017, member institutions reported participating in field conservation projects benefiting over 860 species in 128 countries. AZA zoos and aquariums spent $25 million on research and published 170 books, book chapters, journal articles, conference proceeding papers, posters and theses or dissertations. Animal care, health and welfare, followed by species and habitat conservation, describe 68% of the AZA community&#x27;s research.

== List of member zoos and aquariums ==

<doc id="545108" wikidata="Q3056575" url="?curid=545108" title="Red Meat (comic strip)">
<text>Red Meat is a three panel black-and-white comic strip by Max Cannon. First published in 1989, it has appeared in over 80 newspapers, mainly alternative weeklies and college papers in the United States and in other countries. It has been available online since November 1996.

== Style ==
A visual hallmark of the strip is the almost total lack of movement of the characters from panel to panel, and a &quot;featureless void&quot; of no background. Cannon has said that he wanted &quot;Red Meat&quot; &quot;to have a look that was somewhere between clip art and arresting minimalism, so that the text was more important than the art itself&quot;.

Lambiek&#x27;s Comiclopedia describes &quot;Red Meat&quot; as &quot;a collection of absurd and sometimes cruel comics&quot;. In 1996, Cannon described the essence of the strip as 

&quot;Red Meat&quot; features unrelated &quot;slug lines&quot; at the top of each comic, which Canon explains as &quot;That&#x27;s just my own form of personal poetry. It&#x27;s a little something extra for those who don&#x27;t like comics, but who love the English language.&quot; In 2005, his favorites included &quot;Plastic fruit for a starving nation&quot; and &quot;Official pace car of the apocalypse.&quot;

== Characters ==
&quot;Red Meat&quot; features an extensive cast of characters with unusual characteristics and personalities, described by &quot;Spike Magazine&quot; as &quot;small town America, [populated] entirely with grotesques.&quot; Many of the strip&#x27;s human characters are 1950s caricatures, with Cannon commenting &quot;Several of the characters are designed to have the look of late &#x27;50s, early 60s, real pleasant advertising art.&quot;
* Bug-Eyed Earl – A demented person, resembling Edgar Allan Poe and Steve Buscemi. Earl&#x27;s appearances generally involve him telling a surreal, strange, and sometimes disgusting anecdote.
* Milkman Dan – The local milkman; he is eccentric and hostile towards people and animals, and constantly battles sobriety. Dan also dresses as a cow in the part of McMoo, the anti-drug cow. Cannon said that &quot;Milkmen seem so wholesome, and there’s no way anybody can be that wholesome… I grew up in a military family, and there’s something about that military-style uniform, all cleaned up, a brutal control effort the military necessarily breeds.&quot;
**Karen: A neighborhood child who acts as Milkman Dan&#x27;s nemesis, alternately being the victim or perpetrator of cruel pranks and gibes, described by Cannon as a &quot;spoiled little brat.&quot; 
* Ted Johnson – Cannon has stated that Ted is based on his own father, and said that–despite some readers thinking so–he is not based on Bob Dobbs. He has a taste for sexual fetishes and unusual hobbies.
**Ted&#x27;s Wife: A foil for Ted who appears almost entirely as speech bubbles originating off-panel.
**Ted&#x27;s Son: One of Ted&#x27;s children, the victim of/participant in many of Ted&#x27;s antics.
*Johnny Lemonhead: A man with a large lemon for a head.
*Papa Moai: A godlike multi-dimensional entity in the shape of a living Easter Island Moai.
*Mister Wally: An older, bearded, balding man who acts as proprietor of a tobacconist when not appearing shirtless in public.
*The Old Cowboy: A man smoking a cigarette while leaning against a fence, wearing a cowboy hat and boots, who delivers monologues or converses with characters off-panel.
*Priest: a Catholic priest who stands, looking up, while carrying on conversations with God.
*Stubbo: a stubbled caricature of Sluggo Smith from the &quot;Nancy&quot; comic strip.
*Mr. Bix: A psychopathic robot who speaks in a polite manner but commits violent acts and sometimes vomits on other characters.

== Publication ==
Last strip was published on July 25, 2023. Until then, &quot;Red Meat&quot; had a weekly release schedule. In 1989, after extensive prompting by his friend Joe Forkan, Cannon began producing the strip on a Macintosh SE using Adobe Illustrator. It was initially published in 1989 by the &quot;Arizona Daily Wildcat&quot;, the student newspaper of the University of Arizona, though Cannon was no longer a student of the university at the time. Two months later, it was picked up by the &quot;Tucson Weekly&quot;. Since then it has appeared over 80 publications, including &quot;The Onion&quot;. &quot;Red Meat&quot; is also available online, and has been published online since November 1996, making it one of the oldest still-running webcomics.

On 4 June 2024, Max Cannon announced that he would be resuming publishing new strips as of July, following a &quot;much-needed year off from the Red Meat strip after 33 years of producing a weekly comic.&quot; As of late August 2024, no new comics have been published.

&quot;Red Meat&quot; has been published in several other languages, including French, Italian, Spanish, Danish, and Finnish. Localisers have changed some details, such as the Finnish translation making Milkman Dan into a mailman.

In 2009, Max Cannon urged his readers to contact the editors of their local alternative weekly papers in an effort to save the comics printed within. In a move applauded by Tom Tomorrow, of the weekly strip &quot;This Modern World&quot;, &quot;Red Meat&quot; returned to the pages of &quot;OC Weekly&quot; in 2012 after having been dropped in 2009.

At least three collections of the strips have been released:
* &quot;Red Meat&quot; (1997) 
* &quot;More Red Meat&quot; (1998) 
* &quot;Red Meat Gold&quot; (2005) 

== Reception ==
Bill Griffith, writing in the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, identified the strip as a noteworthy example of &quot;compelling comics on newsprint&quot; in 1996. Matt Groening of &quot;Life in Hell&quot;, praised the strip with &quot;In a culture full of sick, twisted, perverted art, &quot;Red Meat&quot; is up there at the top—it&#x27;s that good.&quot; &quot;Spike Magazine&quot; described the strip as &quot;a window into a parallel world that is uncomfortably close to the real one.&quot; Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, John Hodgman described the strip as &quot;a bracing, bitter tonic — the antidote to comics-page malaise, albeit one that might kill before it cures&quot; and said that it was typified by &quot;the baroquely dark imaginings that make Cannon&#x27;s work more than a tiresome anti-comic.&quot;

The first &quot;Red Meat&quot; collection won a &quot;Special Recognition/Wildcard&quot; Firecracker Alternative Book Award in 1998.

== Author ==
Max Cannon was born into a U.S. Air Force family (his father being a B-52 bomber pilot) on 16 July 1962 in Hunstanton, England, and spent his early years in England and Italy, before moving to Tucson, Arizona in 1977. He attended the University of Arizona, majoring in fine arts. Lambiek&#x27;s &quot;Comiclopedia&quot; states that Cannon was born in England, but the &quot;Tucson Weekly&quot; described him as a &quot;native Tucsonan&quot;.

Cannon is also creator of the eight-episode Comedy Central animated web show &quot;Shadow Rock&quot;,which was based on the &quot;Red Meat&quot; strip. He also contributed to Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #2 &amp; #3, writing stories with Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four, respectively. In a 2009 interview, Cannon said that he taught college animation and was working on two screenplays and doing some preliminary writing on a graphic novel. From 2008 to 2014 Canon worked as an instructor at the Southwest University of Visual Arts, and from 2014 to 2016 he worked as an adjunct instructor at The Art Institute of Tucson. He has also been a hospital worker, and reported on his experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="545123" wikidata="Q170199" url="?curid=545123" title="Sukhoi Su-7">
<text>The Sukhoi Su-7 (NATO designation name: Fitter-A) is a swept wing, supersonic fighter aircraft developed by the Soviet Union in 1955. Originally, it was designed as a tactical, low-level dogfighter, but was not successful in this role. On the other hand, the soon-introduced Su-7B series became the main Soviet fighter-bomber and ground-attack aircraft of the 1960s. The Su-7 was rugged in its simplicity, but its Lyulka AL-7 engine had such high fuel consumption that it seriously limited the aircraft&#x27;s payload, as even short-range missions required that at least two hardpoints be used to carry drop tanks rather than ordnance.

==Design and development==
After Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death, the Sukhoi OKB was reopened and by the summer, it began work on a swept-wing front-line fighter. The first prototype, designated S-1, was designed to use the new Lyulka AL-7 turbojet engine. It was the first Soviet aircraft to utilize the all-moving tailplane and a translating centerbody, a movable inlet cone in the air intake for managing airflow to the engine at supersonic speeds. The aircraft also had a wing sweep of 60°, irreversible hydraulically boosted controls, and an ejection seat of Sukhoi’s own design.

The S-1 first flew on 7 September 1955 with A. G. Kochetkov at the controls. Fitted with an afterburning version of the AL-7 engine after the first eleven flights, the prototype set a Soviet speed record of 2,170 km/h (1,170 kn, 1,350 mph, Mach 2.04) in April 1956. The prototype was intended to be armed with three 37 mm Nudelman N-37 cannons and 32 spin-stabilized 57 mm (2.25 in) unguided rockets in a ventral tray. The second prototype, S-2, introduced some aerodynamic refinements. Testing was complicated by the unreliable engine, and S-1 was lost in a crash on 23 November 1956, killing its pilot I. N. Sokolov. Only 132 have been produced between 1957 and 1960, and the aircraft entered service as Su-7 in 1959.

=== Su-7A fighter ===
The first production variant: a frontline fighter that saw limited operational use in the Far East from 1958. However, in 1959, a decision was made to prioritize production of the MiG-21, thus less than 200 Su-7As were deployed. The Su-7A was retired in 1965 with operational deployment.

=== Su-7B fighter-bomber ===

On July 31, 1958, Soviet tactical aviation (&quot;Frontovaya Aviatsiya&quot;, фронтовая авиация) tasked Sukhoi with developing a ground-attack variant of the Su-7, which could replace the scrapped Ilyushin Il-40. The resulting prototype, designated the S-22, incorporated structural refinements for low-altitude operations at high-speed. The prototype first flew in March 1959; entering service in 1961 as the Su-7B.

Operationally, Su-7s were hampered by a high landing speed of 340–360 km/h. This was dictated by the highly swept wing. Combined with poor visibility from the cockpit and the lack of an instrument landing system, operations were very difficult, especially in poor weather or airfields. In 1961–1962, Sukhoi experimented with blown flaps on S-25 but the benefit was too small to warrant implementation. JATO rockets tested on S-22-4 proved more useful and were incorporated into the Su-7BKL. Attempts to improve takeoff and landing performance eventually resulted in the variable geometry Sukhoi Su-17.

The Su-7B and its variants became the main Soviet ground-attack aircraft of the 1960s. They were also widely exported (691 planes, including some trainers). However, the very short combat radius and need for long runways limited the Su-7&#x27;s operational usefulness. On the other hand, despite its notoriously heavy controls, the Su-7 was popular with pilots for its docile flight characteristics, simple controls and considerable speed even at low altitudes. It also had a reputation for easy maintenance.

In 1977–1986 the Su-7s remaining in Soviet service were replaced by Su-17s and MiG-27s.

==Operational history==

===Egypt===
The Su-7 saw combat with Egypt in the 1967 Six-Day War, the subsequent War of Attrition, and saw use in the Yom Kippur War by the Egyptians to attack Israeli ground forces.

===India===

The Indian Air Force (IAF) used the Su-7 extensively in the 1971 war with Pakistan. Six squadrons, totaling 140 aircraft, flew almost 1,500 offensive sorties during the war, and undertook the bulk of the daytime attack missions. The IAF managed to retain a very high operational tempo with its Su-7s, peaking at a sortie rate of six per pilot per day. Fourteen Su-7s were lost during the war, mostly due to anti-aircraft fire. After the war, it was found that the aircraft had high survivability, being able to fly home safely despite receiving heavy damage. For example, Wing Commander H.S. Mangat&#x27;s Su-7 was badly damaged by a PL-2 missile fired by a Pakistan Air Force F-6. The impact was so severe that half the rudder was missing, the elevators, ailerons, and flaps were severely damaged, and half the missile was stuck in the chute pipe. The pilot made it back to his base. The death of at least one Indian pilot can be attributed, at least indirectly, to poor cockpit design. A pilot had moved his seating forward to a dangerous position, &quot;because he found the bombsight and the front gun sight easier to operate&quot; while in that position and was killed on ejection.

Indian Su-7BMKs shot down at least two Shenyang F-6s in the 1971 war, while losing three Su-7s to F-6s according to Pakistani sources.

==Operators==
===Current operators===
*North Korean Air Force – received at least 28 Su-7BMK/-7UMK in 1971. The aircraft were ordered in 1969.

===Former operators===

* Afghan Air Force – 24 Su-7BMK and 16 Su-7U trainers, were delivered to Afghanistan from 1972. Constant fighting, a high accident rate in the high altitude and poor maintenance caused substantial attrition. An additional 79 used replacements from Soviet stocks were supplied during the 1980s. None remain in service.

* Algerian Air Force – 40 Su-7BMK.

* Czechoslovak Air Force – the Czechoslovak Air Force was the first foreign operator of the Su-7 in 1963. Totals included 64 Su-7BM, 31 Su-7BKL and Su-7U. During operations service, 30 aircraft were lost in accidents. The remaining aircraft were phased out in 1990.

*Egyptian Air Force – The first batch of 14 Su-7BMK was destroyed during the Six-Day War. From 1967–1972, Egypt received an additional 185 Su-7BMK/SU-7UMK. Those which survived the Yom Kippur War with Israel were retired in the mid-1980s.
*Indian Air Force – 140 were delivered in 1968, equipping six squadrons. An additional 14 attrition replacements were provided. The last aircraft were retired in 1986.

*Iraqi Air Force – The first contract for up to 34 Su-7BMK was signed in 1965, with deliveries starting in the spring of 1967. An additional order for 20 Su-7BMK was signed in July 1967. No longer in service.

*Polish Air Force – operated 6 Su-7BM, 33 Su-7BKŁ and 8 Su-7U from July 1964 until June 1990; no longer in service.

*Soviet Air Force

*Syrian Air Force – Shortly after the Six-Day War of 1967, Syria received 25 Su-7s. During the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Syria lost most of the aircraft supplied. After 1973, The Soviet Union resupplied Syria with 35 more aircraft. By the mid 1980s, the Su-7 had been transferred to the reserves, and by the 1990s were decommissioned.

<doc id="545125" wikidata="Q1456360" url="?curid=545125" title="Hendiadys">
<text>Hendiadys () is a figure of speech used for emphasis—&quot;The substitution of a conjunction for a subordination&quot;. The basic idea is to use two words linked by the conjunction &quot;and&quot; instead of the one modifying the other.

Hendiadys in English is also known as two for one and figure of twins. Although the underlying phrase is &#x27;, the only other forms occasionally found in English arehendiaduoandhendiaduous, the latter of which the 17th-century English Biblical commentator Matthew Poole used in his commentary on , , and .

== Use and effect ==

The typical result of a hendiadys is to transform a noun-plus-adjective into two nouns joined by a conjunction. For example, sound and fury (from act V, scene 5 of &quot;Macbeth&quot;) seems to offer a more striking image than &quot;furious sound&quot;. In this example, as typically, the subordinate idea originally present in the adjective is transformed into a noun in and of itself.

Another example is Dieu et mon droit, present in the coat of arms of the United Kingdom. In fact, hendiadys is most effective in English when the adjectival and nominal forms of the word are identical. Thus &quot;the cold wind went down the hall&quot; becomes the cold and the wind went down the hall. He came despite rain and weather instead of &quot;He came despite the rainy weather&quot;.

Two verbs (as in the case of a catenative verb) can be so joined: come and get it (also come get it in American English) and Fowler says that try and... for &quot;try to...&quot; is a &quot;true example&quot; of hendiadys.
The etymology of try and... is explained in a &quot;Usage Note&quot; in the online Merriam Webster Dictionary

The conjunction may be elided (parataxis): This coffee is nice and hot can become This is nice hot coffee; in both cases one is saying that the coffee is hot to a nice degree, not that the coffee itself would be nice even if cold.

When hendiadys fails in its effects, it can sound merely redundant. For example, the Latin grade cum amicitia atque pace, literally with friendship and peace, which originally contained hendiadys for emphasis, is often translated instead as &quot;with peaceful friendship&quot;, which lacks hendiadys, and can therefore be interpreted to lack the same emphasis as the original phrase.

== In classical and Biblical literature ==
Hendiadys is often used in Latin poetry. There are many examples in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, e.g., Book 1, line 54: &quot;vinclis et carcere&quot;, literally translated as &quot;with chains and prison&quot; but the phrase means &quot;with prison chains&quot;.

 &quot;markəbǒt par‘õh wəḥêlô&quot;
the chariots of Pharaoh and his army for &quot;the chariots of Pharaoh&#x27;s army&quot;

In , the Hebrew says &quot;ger v&#x27;toshav&quot;, literally translated as &quot;an alien and a resident&quot;, but the phrase means a &quot;resident alien&quot;.

In , the Hebrew says &quot;ibbad v&#x27;shibar&quot;, literally translated as &quot;ruined and broken&quot;, but the phrase means &quot;totally destroyed&quot;.

In , the phrase literally translated as a cloud by day, and smoke is sometimes interpreted as a hendiadys meaning &quot;a cloud of smoke by day&quot;.

In , the Greek says &quot;ὅσα προσεύχεσθε καὶ αἰτεῖσθε&quot;, literally translated as &quot;whatever you pray and ask&quot;, but the phrase means &quot;whatever you ask in prayer&quot;.

William Shakespeare uses hendiadys throughout his canon, most notably in &quot;Hamlet&quot; where their use is replete. When cautioning his sister Ophelia, Laertes makes use of this rhetorical trope repeatedly with &quot;safety and health&quot; (1.3.20), &quot;voice and yielding&quot; (1.3.22), and &quot;morn and liquid dew&quot; (1.3.41). Perhaps the most famous use of hendiadys in the play is Hamlet&#x27;s own &quot;Oh what a rogue and peasant slave am I” (2.2.538).

== As linguistic terminology in describing Turkic languages ==
Hendiadys is the preferred terminology used to describe some types of compounding in Turkic linguistics. Johanson, in his discussion of Turkic compounding, considers compounds of synonymous components to be hendiadys:The asyndetic type noun + noun is also used in coordinative compounds, so-called twin words or binomes. In this case, two parallel nouns with similar meanings form a synonym compound, &quot;hendiadys&quot;, ...or a hyponym compound to express a higher concept...

== See also ==

Hendiadys is different from these:
* Hendiatris, &quot;one through three&quot; does not have a subordination of parts
* Irreversible binomial, word pairs of collocation in which the order of the words cannot be reversed
* Litotes, a form of understatement for emphasis
* Merism, a figure of speech in which a whole is indicated by a brief enumeration of parts
* Legal doublets, which are the conjoining of two synonymous words
* Antiptosis

<text>The Hillman Imp is a small economy car that was made by the Rootes Group and its successor Chrysler Europe from 1963 until 1976. Revealed on 3 May 1963, after much advance publicity, it was the first British mass-produced car with the engine block and cylinder head cast in aluminium.

This unorthodox small/light car was designed for the Rootes Group by Michael Parkes (who later became a Formula One driver) and Tim Fry. It was manufactured at the purpose-built Linwood plant in Scotland. As well as the Hillman marque, there was a series of variations, including an estate car (the Husky), a van and a coupé.

The Imp enjoyed modest success in both club and international rallying. Rootes introduced a homologation special called the Rally Imp in 1964. It featured many modifications over the standard model, the most important of which was an engine enlarged to 998 cc. Notable successes for this model include the 1965 Tulip Rally in which the works Imps of Rosemary Smith and &quot;Tiny&quot; Lewis finished first and second overall.

Considered ahead of its time, the Imp nevertheless suffered from reliability problems, which harmed its reputation and led to the Rootes Group being taken over by Chrysler Europe in 1967. The Imp continued in production until March 1976, selling just under half a million units in 13 years.

== History ==

=== Development ===
Known internally within the Rootes Groups as the &quot;APEX&quot; project, the Imp came about because of the fuel shortage caused by the Suez Crisis in 1956. Petrol was rationed in the UK, sales of the heavy cars for which Rootes was known had dramatically slumped, and there was a huge market for small economical cars with low fuel usage. The BMC&#x27;s Mini had already taken advantage of the opportunity, with production starting in 1959. Although the project officially began in 1955, the market for small cars was soon recognised and it was evident that the project would evolve into Rootes&#x27; first small, economical car.

Seeing an opportunity, Mike Parkes and Tim Fry offered to design the car: &quot;Well, Mike Parkes and I were very good friends. So we went to the director of engineering, B. B. Winter, and said to him we could design you just the car we want. And he said: &#x27;Alright, get on with it then!&#x27;&quot;. The early stages of development presented &quot;The Slug&quot;, which had clear similarities to a bubble car. However, the Rootes design board were not satisfied with this approach, and ordered the design team to press forward. That led to the next stage of the Slug, which appeared more utilitarian with appropriate styling.

Extensive road testing was carried out in Norway in winter conditions, East Africa in the height of summer and in Arctic conditions in Canada by a small team led by Ken Sharpe (Chief Development Engineer, Ryton)

Rootes did previously look at building a small car twice, even if both ultimately contributed little to the development of the Imp. The first being the 1938–1939 Little Jim prototype, which featured a conventional front-engined rear-wheel drive layout equipped with a 750cc water-cooled engine followed later by the post-war rear-engined 1949 Little Jimmy prototype by Craig Miller that would make use of a Volkswagen-based twin-cylinder engine.

It was originally envisaged by Rootes the 742cc Coventry Climax FWMA inspired engine would be available in three sizes, 800cc, 875cc and 998cc. However it was not to be as through a combination of engineering production costs, Apex’s increased weight and size, together with experimental dry-liner 998cc engines being unreliable, resulted in only the 875cc engine being standardized at the cost of imposing a constraint on the Imp as a one-capacity car that competitors like the Mini did not experience. One alternative solution considered before being dropped was to develop a new taller block giving the engine a longer stroke whilst retaining the 875cc engine&#x27;s dry-liners, however this would have been an expensive procedure and would have only been worth the investment had the Imp been a success. A few long-stroke engines were built and evaluated, the work not completely going to waste as they would go on many years later to be bored out up to 1150cc and used to great in effect in competition by the likes of Paul Emery, Andy Dawson, Ian Carter and others.

The later 998cc engines in the Rallye Imps meanwhile would on the other hand make use of expensive wet-lines and were not really intended for road use, rather only for competition and further tuning. It was later discovered the largest reliable limit the 875cc engine would tolerate was 948cc, however in the absence of more development neither the 948cc engine nor the envisaged 928cc engine were used, the latter originally being proposed as early as the mid-1960s for a projected Mark III Imp that became a victim of Chrysler’s cost-cutting before it reappeared years later in the Chrysler Sunbeam.

=== Mark I Imp: 1963–1965 ===

The Hillman Imp was officially announced on 2 May 1963, when HRH Duke of Edinburgh was invited to open the factory in Linwood. After the opening, he then drove a silver Imp to Glasgow Airport. One of the first Imps produced is currently on display at the Glasgow Museum of Transport. Another early example from 1963 is at the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu, with the registration 1400 SC.

Before and after its announcement, the Imp garnered significant attention from the motoring press. In 1962, the Small Car &amp; Mini Owner magazine published an article titled &quot;Enter the AJAX!&quot;, particularly noting the all-aluminium water-cooled rear engine. The same year, the &quot;Daily Express&quot; published an article titled &quot;It&#x27;s the new &#x27;baby&#x27;&quot;, calling it &quot;the first baby car ever built by the Rootes Group&quot;. In June 1963, the &quot;Motor Sport&quot; magazine commented on the press&#x27; reaction to the Imp who strongly favoured the Imp in terms of its engine, gearbox and competitive price; at launch, the standard model cost £508 1s 3d, while the deluxe version was £532 4s 7d.

The name &quot;Imp&quot; was originally the name of an engine produced by Ailsa Craig Ltd., a manufacturer of marine engines. In 1962 the company was acquired by Warsop Fram Group, and all of Ailsa Craig Ltd&#x27;s assets were up for sale. The Warsop Fram Group traded the Imp name to the Rootes Group in exchange for a new Humber Super Snipe motor car. The namesake was to emphasize its small-size, and to help it sell as the obvious competitor for the Mini.

The water-cooled four-cylinder power unit was inspired by the Coventry Climax FWMA engine, featuring an all-aluminium alloy overhead camshaft, combined with a full-synchromesh aluminium transaxle. This combination was very advanced at the time. Sir Alec Issigonis, designer of the BMC&#x27;s Mini, had recently described the fitting of synchromesh on all forward gears as &quot;impossible&quot;. Besides the engine&#x27;s unique design, it was canted at a 45° angle to keep the center of gravity low and optimise road-holding.

As reported in tests such as &quot;The Practical Car and Driver&quot;, rear-engined cars generally suffer from oversteer handling characteristics to some extent, and to counteract that as much as possible, the Imp has a semi-trailing arm independent rear suspension system. The relatively costly and sophisticated solution, atypical for small-car design at the time, was insisted upon by its designers after lengthy testing of a Chevrolet Corvair with swing axles. To attain balanced handling, the Imp actually used swing axle geometry at the front, but that initially led to too much understeer, and the camber was later reduced by lowering the pivot points.

Gradually increasing in popularity in the UK, Mark I sales in 1963 were estimated at 33,000, and increased to 50,142 in 1964. However, Imp sales decreased in 1965 to 42,663. Reliability problems had quickly surfaced, mainly due to poor cooling of the rear engine, and the public image of the car was becoming negative. That was extremely worrying for the Rootes Group who were trying to compete with the Mini, production of which totalled 1,190,000 during the 1960s.

The Mark I was introduced as a 2-door saloon, which appeared in two models; the Basic and De Luxe. In October 1964, a luxury edition was introduced, known as the Singer Chamois.

=== Mark II Imp: 1965–1968 ===
Following the initial problems that affected the Mark I, the Rootes Group decided to re-introduce the Imp with significant changes both mechanically and cosmetically.

The Mk I Imps had a pneumatic throttle linkage and an automatic choke, both of which were replaced by more conventional items on the Mk II. The Mk II also had improved front suspension geometry, and several trim and detail changes. Although the car was constantly improved over its production life, there was no single change as significant as those in 1965. Among the changes were an added water pump, cylinder head with larger ports and valves, and &#x27;Mark II&#x27; emblems on the side of the doors.

=== Mark III Imp: 1968–1976 ===

The Imp was never officially badged nor referred to as the &quot;Mark III&quot;. However, changes were made to the range when the Rootes Group was fully acquired by Chrysler Europe, and so that version is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Chrysler Imp&quot;.

After Rootes Group&#x27;s acquisition by Chrysler in 1968, the entire range was revised, except for the Stiletto. The instrument panel and steering wheel were redesigned. The large speedometer previously positioned behind the steering wheel was replaced by a horizontal row of four circular dials/displays of varying detail and complexity, according to the model involved. The right-hand dial, the speedometer, was now to one side of the driver&#x27;s normal sightline, while one multi-functional stalk on the right side of the steering column replaced the two control stalks that had been directly behind the steering wheel, one on each side. The earlier Imp had been praised for the good ergonomic quality of its dash-board/fascia, and its replacement reflected similar trends in other new and modified UK vehicles at a time of &quot;production rationalization&quot;. The more modern arrangement on the Imp was seen by some as a missed opportunity.

=== Rootes, Chrysler and end of production ===

The initial problems damaged the Imp&#x27;s reputation and popularity trailed off, with half of all production being from the first three years. It still sold thanks to its competitive price, distinctive styling, and cheap running costs, but sales never lived up to expectations for what had become a very competent small car. Another problem that contributed to the reputation for poor reliability was the lack of understanding of the maintenance needs of alloy engines by owners and the motor trade in the 1960s. Regular failures of the Giubo couplings also occurred. It was overshadowed in popularity by the Mini.

The company&#x27;s huge investment in both the Imp and the Linwood production plant was to be a significant part of the demise of the Rootes Group. The Imp&#x27;s commercial failure added to the major losses suffered by Rootes, although the main reasons for these losses were unresolved industrial unrest and the effects of the link with the Chrysler Corporation of the USA. The link was initiated by Lord (William) Rootes in 1964 as a partnership, but he died in October of that year and by 1967 the company had been acquired by Chrysler, to become part of Chrysler Europe. A year later, ahead of the 1968 London Motor Show, the recommended retail prices of most Imp models were reduced for the domestic market by more than four per cent, despite the general price inflation affecting the UK. Chrysler stewardship was blamed by some for the demise of the Imp in March 1976, after fewer than 441,000 had been built, but the entire Chrysler Europe operation was not a success and two years later it became part of Peugeot. The Imp was one of Britain&#x27;s longest-running production cars with a 13-year run, despite lower sales in its later years. Its place in the Chrysler UK range was taken the following year by the Chrysler Sunbeam, a three-door hatchback based on the Avenger rear-wheel drive underpinnings. Both cars continued to be produced at the Linwood plant until it closed in 1981, after just 18 years in use.

The Ryton assembly plant continued in operation until December 2006, when production of the Peugeot 206 was switched to Slovakia.

== Design ==

Being a direct competitor to the BMC&#x27;s Mini, it used a space-saving rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout to allow as much luggage and passenger capacity as possible in both the rear and the front of the car. It used a unique opening rear hatch to allow luggage to be put into the back seat rest.

It was the first mass-produced British car with the engine in the back and the first to use a diaphragm spring clutch. The baulk-ring synchromesh unit for the transaxle compensated for the speeds of gear and shaft before engagement, from which the Mini had suffered during its early production years.

It incorporated many design features which were uncommon. Among them were a folding rear bench seat, automatic choke which was rare on compact cars outside the United States until the 1970s, and gauges for temperature, voltage and oil pressure which have been largely omitted since the 1950s in favour of emergency lights.

The engine proved flexible and very easy to tune. It was an overhead camshaft design, which permitted better air flow than a standard OHV engine. As with all engine heads, it could also be flowed and ported to allow better airflow at high engine speeds. Useful improvements in power could be gained by replacing the standard silencer (muffler) with one that impeded the exhaust gas flow less and with better carburettors. However, in adapting the design to suit modern mass-production methods, Rootes had left the engine more fragile than the Coventry Climax model from which it had been derived.

The Imp used a derivative of the Climax FWMA engine whereas the Lotus cars used an FWMC engine which had an entirely different cylinder head.

== Marketing ==

Initially, the Imp was seen by Rootes as a potential second car for families with the means to acquire one. In this incarnation, it was a somewhat revolutionary, high-quality small car, with some above average features. Later the concept evolved into a kind of ultra-economy car with some cheaply and poorly executed, design features as a utilitarian vehicle, like some of the Eastern European marques of the time like Škoda, and later Lada, which were relatively low-cost economy cars, popular with British consumers. At one point the basic Hillman Imp was the cheapest new car on the British market, which increased low sales figures for a time.

== Variants and &quot;badge engineering&quot; ==


Over the life of the car, Rootes (and later Chrysler UK) produced four body styles. The original saloon was introduced in May 1963 and ran through to the end of production in 1976. It has an opening rear window, making it effectively a hatchback. The opening rear window is intended to make it easier to load the small luggage area behind the fold-down rear seat. The fold-down nature of the rear seat was itself unusual in small car design at the time, being more often associated with larger upmarket estate cars. In 1965 a van badged as the &quot;Commer Imp&quot; was introduced. A coupe, the Imp Californian, was introduced in 1967 at the same time as the van&#x27;s pressings were used to create an estate car, badged &quot;Hillman Husky&quot;. Several estate car prototypes using the saloon body with extended rooflines were tried, but never offered to the public. Instead, buyers choosing the estate had to settle for a van-derived car with somewhat unusual styling. Both the van and estate ceased production in 1970.

In an attempt to interest a wider public when sales figures fell well short of the intended 100,000 cars per annum, several badge-engineered derivatives, such as the luxury Singer Chamois (launched October 1964), and the Sunbeam Sport (launched October 1966), with a more powerful twin-carburettor engine, were offered with varying degrees of success. For marketing reasons the Singer variants were sold as Sunbeams in many export markets, even before May 1970 when the Singer marque was discontinued altogether by Chrysler UK. In some markets, such as France, the &quot;Sunbeam&quot; name was used on all British Rootes products, including the Imp and the Husky.

The coupe bodyshell is similar to the standard body but features a more shallow-raked windscreen and rear window which, unlike that on the standard bodied cars, can not be opened. The attempt at a more sporty design did not translate into better acceleration or top speed figures and the aerodynamics of the standard saloon are actually slightly better. The new body style made its first appearance at the Paris Motor Show in October 1967, with the introduction of the sporting Sunbeam Stiletto. The coupe body had also appeared, with less powerful engines, in the Hillman Imp Californian announced in January 1967 and the more luxurious Singer Chamois coupe.

== Manufacture ==

The Imp was a massive and expensive leap of faith for Rootes. The company did not have recent experience building small cars, even though it started off as a car builder by offering the then small Hillman Minx back in 1931. However, the Minx had since grown larger and was well established as a medium-size family car by the time the Imp was introduced. For the Imp, Rootes pioneered the use of an aluminium engine in a mass-production car. This process proved to be more complicated than simply substituting an aluminium design for a familiar and well-understood cast-iron design. Rootes had to build a new, computerised assembly plant on the outskirts of Paisley, in Linwood, in which to assemble the Imp. The UK Government Regional Assistance policy provided financial grants to the Rootes Group to bring approximately 6,000 jobs to the area. Linwood had become an area of significant unemployment because of redundancies in the declining shipbuilding industry on the nearby River Clyde. The investment also included an advanced die-casting plant to manufacture the aluminium engine casings, and a stake in a brand new Pressed Steel Company motor pressings works, which manufactured all the new car&#x27;s body panels. The location of the plant led to significant logistical issues for the manufacturing process. Linwood was over away from Rootes&#x27; main factory at Ryton-on-Dunsmore, but the engine castings made in Linwood had to be sent to Ryton to be machined and assembled, then sent back up to be put on the cars — a round trip. This was addressed by a complex schedule of trains shifting completed cars and raw castings south, and trains loaded with engine- gearbox assemblies and many other Ryton-sourced goods running north. To aid with balancing the logistical costs of this operation, body pressings for the Hillman Avenger were also made at Linwood, but transported south to Ryton on the component trains. This schedule remained in operation for the duration of Linwood Imp production.

The local West of Scotland workforce, recruited mainly from the shipbuilding industry, did not bring the distinct skills necessary for motor vehicle assembly, and Imp build quality and reliability suffered accordingly. However, industrial relations were also an issue in production. Industrial disputes and strike action became a regular occurrence, as was the case in many parts of British industry in the 1960s and 1970s.

Approximately half a million, half of this number coming in the first three years of production.

== Overseas assembly ==
Unassembled cars were exported for assembly in Australia, Costa Rica, Ireland, Malaysia, Malta, New Zealand, Philippines, Portugal, South Africa, Uruguay, and Venezuela. New Zealand cars were assembled as Hillmans by Chrysler/Hillman importer Todd Motors for several years from about 1964. The model returned, this time as a four-headlamp Sunbeam with the newer dashboard. Production of the Imp stopped in 1970 because Todd Motors required the Imp assembly line to build the Hillman Avenger. Todd Motors only had two final assembly lines at Petone, so the Avenger and the Hunter shared one line and the larger Chrysler Valiant was built on the other.

Imps were assembled by Rootes Australia in their Port Melbourne factory from 1964. The following models were produced:

* PM Imp: Available in Standard trim only. Produced from 1964 to 1965. Built from UK Mk I Imp CKD kits. In 1965 a Super Imp was released (refer to photo of white car with red flash above) and featured improvements due to the issues with the Mk1 and these were to carry over to the IMP II.
* PA Imp: Badged as &quot;IMP II&quot;. Available in Standard or Super trim. Sold from February 1966– March 1968, it was still based on UK Mk I CKD kits.
* PB Imp: Badged as &quot;IMP III&quot;. Also available in Standard or Super trim. Produced from 1968 to around 1970. Further improvements made over the PA Imp, early cars were still based on UK Mk I CKD kits, but as these were depleted, UK Mk II CKD kits were used. The very last batch of IMP IIIs may have used the CKD Imp Sport body shell only. Later IMP IIIs also used the UK Mk II engine.
* Hillman GT: built from Sunbeam Imp Sport CKD kits. Produced from 1967 to the end of 1968.
* Hillman Sonic/Stiletto: convertible model produced for Chrysler Australia by Eiffel Tower Motors of Dandenong.

== Motorsport ==
Between August 12 and 14, 1964, a Sunbeam Imp sports sedan (ZT-86-20) completed the First American Rodding Magazine sanctioned endurance run and broke a world record in the process, previously set by Erwin George “Cannonball” Baker in 1933, driving from New York City, to Los Angeles, California, covering 3,011 miles in 48 hours, 9 minutes, 54 seconds at an average speed of 63.7 mph.

The Imp gained a reputation as a successful rally car when Rosemary Smith won the Tulip Rally in 1965. That led the Rootes Group to produce a special rally conversion of the Imp under both the Hillman and Singer marques, known as the Imp &quot;Rallye&quot;. In 1966, after winning the Coupe des Dames, Smith was disqualified under a controversial ruling regarding the headlamps of her Imp. The Imp was also successful in touring car racing when Bill McGovern won the British Saloon Car Championship in 1970, 1971 and 1972.

Imps were also successful racing cars. The privateer team of George Bevan dominated the British Saloon Car Championship (later known as the British Touring Car Championship) in the early 1970s. Driven by Bill McGovern, the Bevan Sunbeam Imp won the championship in 1970, 1971 and 1972 with limited factory support.

In UK club racing the Imp variants became highly successful in the under 1000 cc Special Saloon category. Notable exponents of the Imp in racing include Ian Forrest, Harry Simpson, Ricky Gauld, John Homewood, Roger Nathan, Gerry Birrell, Ray Payne and Chris Barter. To this day Imps still compete on historic rallies in the UK, with the Vokes&#x27; car often making it onto the podium in the HRCR Clubmans Rally Championship.

The Imp was also successfully raced and rallied in other parts of the world, notably Asia, where drivers including Andrew Bryson and Pardaman Singh regularly won saloon car categories into the 1980s.

The 998 cc Imp engine was also used in three-wheeled racing sidecars in the 1970s and 1980s. Exhaust systems were naturally constructed on a one-off basis. The engines often sporting the Twin Weber twin-choke setup. A number of sidecar crews raced Imp-equipped outfits at the Isle of Man TT races, best placement being Roy Hanks in eleventh place in the 1976 TT 1000cc Sidecar. Imp-engined outfits are still regularly championed in classic racing.

Andy Chesman won the 1972 World Hydroplane championship using an Imp engine. He bought Imp specialist company Greetham Engineering and designed a wedge head to increase the 998 cc engine to 125 bhp with twin 40DCOE Weber carburetors. He also fitted a spacer on top of the wet block to accommodate longer cylinder liners, increasing capacity to 1220 cc. At the BP-sponsored Windermere records week in October 1972, he raised the R1 Class water speed record to . He was killed in 1998 in a power-boat accident, still holding the record.

<text>Reutlingen University (in German &quot;Hochschule Reutlingen&quot;; formerly &quot;FHTW Reutlingen&quot;) is a university of applied sciences, involved in education and research. It is located in Reutlingen in the southern German state of Baden-Württemberg. Enrollment stands at about 5,500 students, a quarter of whom are international and exchange students. Reutlingen University has a long tradition as a second home for international students; over a quarter of the students currently registered come from countries outside Germany. The university offers undergraduate and graduate programs in the main fields of International Business, Engineering, Information, Medical and Natural Science and Design. In contrast to common university structures, the orientation of the faculties is less the result of the sciences located there. It rather results from their industry driven specialization. The five schools of Reutlingen University are the School of Applied Chemistry, ESB Business School, the School of Information Technology, the School of Engineering and the School of Textiles &amp; Design. Top Five placements in various rankings and its reputation amongst industry and commerce has made it one of Germany&#x27;s most prestigious universities of applied sciences.

Reutlingen University&#x27;s campus sits on the southwestern edge of Reutlingen, close to recreation and sport areas (including the city football stadium). Two bus lines serve the campus, and the town center is a 20-minute walk away. Two neighborhood centers are each a five-minute walk from campus and the dormitories, featuring shopping centers, banks, and doctors.

==History==

=== Foundation in the Kingdom of Württemberg ===

The history of Reutlingen University goes back to the School of Weaving established in 1855 by the Kingdom of Württemberg, the city of Reutlingen, and the textile industry. The school was renamed in 1891 and became the Royal College of Technology for Textile Industry (German: Königlich Württembergisches Technikum für Textilindustrie), a technical college for spinning, weaving, and knitting. After the end of monarchy in 1918, the college received state recognition and changed its name once more to the State College of Technology (German: Staatliches Technikum). Two years later, the State Testing and Examination Authority for Textiles was founded in Reutlingen.
=== Extension after World War II ===
In 1967, Mechanical Engineering was added to the State College of Technology, and in 1971, the College received official recognition as a Fachhochschule (University of Applied Sciences). In the Department of Business Studies, the first course in International Business began. A year later, the business course Production Management enrolled its first students.

Work began on the new Hohbuch campus in 1975, and the university moved there in 1977. The old buildings in the center of town were handed over to the police force, and parts of the original equipment from the Weaving School and other documentation were placed in the Industrial Museum of Reutlingen.

=== Internationalization and Addition of Further Schools ===
In 1979, the European Study Program for Business Management (ESB), with its partner schools Middlesex University in London and NEOMA Business School Reims, enrolled its first students. With this new program, Reutlingen University became the first partner institution for double degrees in Germany. With its internationalization strategy, Reutlingen University increased its global reputation. In mid-2008, Reutlingen University merged all three of its business schools (European School of Business, School of International Business, and Production Management) into one school under the European School of Business (ESB) name. Today, ESB Business School ranks among the top business schools in Germany.

Today&#x27;s Building 2, home to the School of Applied Chemistry, opened in 1983, and in 1984, the first students entered Automation Technology and Business Information Science classes. The same year, the Export Academy Baden-Württemberg was founded at the university with a postgraduate degree course in International Marketing.

The largest building on campus opened in 1987 by the Minister-President of Baden-Württemberg with space for Reutlingen University&#x27;s technology departments. The degree course in Electronic Engineering began in 1989. The degree courses, Mechatronics and Media/Communication Information Technology, opened their doors in 2003. In full accordance with European agreements, all degree courses switched in 2003 to internationally recognized Bachelor&#x27;s and Master&#x27;s qualifications.

=== Establishment of International Reputation ===
Today, Reutlingen University comprises five schools with international accreditation: School of Applied Chemistry (AC, Angewandte Chemie), ESB Business School (ESB), School of Information Technology (INF, Informatik), School of Engineering (TEC, Technik) and School of Textiles &amp; Design (TD, Textil &amp; Design). It has over 200 partner universities worldwide and offers 16 Bachelor&#x27;s degrees and 23 Master&#x27;s degrees, including MBA&#x27;s for officers of the Bundeswehr (Federal Defense of Germany).

== Organization ==
Since 2012, Hendrik Brumme is President of Reutlingen University, succeeding his predecessor Peter Nieß und Wolfgang Hiller. Since 2019, Alexander Leisner is chancellor and hence head of administration. The University&#x27;s President is elected by the University Advisory Board, which is responsible for the development and competitiveness of the University. Moreover, it supervises the management of the President’s Office and deals with further matters concerning its own management, such as the election of the President or decisions about its structure and development plan. The Chairman of the University Advisory Board is Christoph Kübel, Managing Director and Director of Industrial Relations of Robert Bosch GmbH. The schools are organized decentrally and directed by Faculty Deans, who are elected by their respective school council. Students have an institutionalized right to participate in the decision making process through Senator mandates, seats in the school councils or as appointed members of academic commissions. Furthermore, a so-called AStA and the constituted student body engage in improving the students&#x27; study conditions and supporting student initiatives.

==Schools &amp; Degree Programs==

=== School of Applied Chemistry ===
About 500 students study at the School of Applied Chemistry (AC). Research and teaching are focusing the fields of medical technology, environmental protection, food, automotive, plastics and electronics.
=== ESB Business School ===
With about 2500 students (of which about 30 percent come from abroad), ESB Business School (ESB) is the largest of the five schools. The main fields for research and teaching are business administration, foreign trade, business engineering and business development. Since 2019 ESB Business School has been accredited by the AACSB for one of the highest international quality standards. Thereby, ESB Business School belongs to the world&#x27;s best five percent of all business schools. Since 2013 it has been accredited by FIBAA, the programme &quot;International Management Double Degree&quot; with premium seal.
=== School of Information Technology ===
With 860 students, the School of Information Technology (INF) is the third largest faculty at the university. The study programs concentrate on scientific areas related to digitisation and digitalization.
=== School of Engineering ===
At Reutlingen University, around 1140 students study at the School of Engineering (TEC). The faculty&#x27;s research activities are supported by the Robert Bosch Centre for Power Electronics (rbz), a research and teaching cooperation between Robert Bosch GmbH, Reutlingen University and the University of Stuttgart.
=== School of Textiles &amp; Design ===
The School of Textiles &amp; Design represents the oldest department (since 1855) and the historical origin of Reutlingen University. About 690 of the over 5.000 students at Reutlingen University are enrolled here. Thematically, researching and teaching concentrates on textile technology, fashion, retail and design. The faculty includes affiliates such as the research laboratory F+TRC (Fashion and Textile Research Center) and an extensive machinery park with laboratories. The faculty owns the world&#x27;s most extensive collection of historically significant fabrics (approx. 900 objects).
== Center for Applied Research ==
Applied research and development are carried out in several institutes on campus. Research and development projects supported by state and federal ministries, and also by the European Union, are carried out in cooperation with industry - in particular with small- and medium-size enterprises. By this means the institutes make contributions to the innovative ability of German industry and provide topical relevance to students. Research is focused mainly in the following areas:

Institute for Applied Research (IAF)

*Process analysis, control, and optimization
*Clothing technology, quality management, technical textiles
*Renewable resources, polymer materials
*Interface analysis and surface technology

Institute for Applied Research in Automation (IFA)

*Production Automation and Sensor Systems (PASS) focusing mainly on image processing, robotics, telematics, signal processing, and driverless transportation systems
*CAD/CAM in Design and Simulation, innovation management, benchmarking and energy technology

ESB-Research Institute

*Innovation in business and enterprises
*Implications of emerging knowledge society
*Processes and consequences of globalization
*Cooperation with partner universities of International Partnership of Business Schools (IPBS)

==Export Academy Baden-Württemberg==
The Export-Akademie offers a large number of programs for international business which do not lead to academic degrees. Most of these courses are taught or supervised by the teaching staff of the ESB Reutlingen. The Export-Akademie consists of the following departments: SEFEX (Seminars for the Exporting Industry), ZIM (a certificate course for export managers), OBS (a retraining program by the Otto Benecke Trust), and IMI (the International Management Institute).

SEFEX (Seminars for the Exporting Industry) offers seminars over one or several days on special aspects of international business. These are specially designed to meet the needs of small- to medium-size enterprises. University teachers with international experience organize the seminars and deal with the fundamental principles. External lecturers from the business world guarantee a practical orientation and up-to-date information.

ZIM offers systematic part-time training for professionals in international trade. The program can be taken in part or as a whole. It works to a large extent with the study materials of the part-time MBA program of the European School of Business. There are no formal prerequisites for participation in this program. On successful completion, participants are awarded a certificate. Under certain circumstances, participants in the program can go on to study at the Distance Learning University of Switzerland, where they can earn an academic degree.

The OBS program is a business retraining program for economists and engineers who have come to Germany from the ex-Soviet Union. These migrants have completed an academic degree and have work experience which is often very different from what is usual in the German market. The aim of the OBS courses is to remove these obstacles and to adapt the participants to professional requirements in Germany. To achieve this, it also includes trainee programs in German companies.

IMI (the International Management Institute) is designed for managers and specialists from Eastern Europe and from emerging and developing countries. It provides these people with further training in international business and assists in setting up international business academies in these countries. IMI takes on contracts from a number of German and international organizations.

==International==

The university maintains over 100 partnership and cooperation agreements with universities around the world, overseen by the International Office.

Five universities enjoy major partnerships with Reutlingen University, sending students to and from all departments and in some cases offering special courses on Reutlingen&#x27;s campus: Swinburne University of Technology (Hawthorn/Melbourne, Australia), Xi&#x27;an University of Technology (Xi&#x27;an, China), Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (Monterrey, Mexico), Kettering University (Flint, Michigan), and Valparaiso University (Valparaiso, Indiana).

<text>&quot;The Adventure of Foulkes Rath&quot; is a Sherlock Holmes murder mystery by Adrian Conan Doyle, the youngest son of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the Sherlock Holmes creator. The story was published in the 1954 collection &quot;The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It was first published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on 27 June 1953, and was illustrated by Robert Fawcett in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;.

== Plot ==
Dr. Watson wonders why Holmes has not been involved in the investigation of the apparent murder of Colonel Matthias Addleton by his nephew Percy Longton, only to find that Holmes already has a telegram in his hand from the family attorney. Holmes learns that the uncle and nephew had quarreled over the sale of property belonging to the estate after the uncle had returned from a late night horse ride. Servants, aroused by a scream later that night, found Longton standing over his dying uncle with an axe in his hand. The evidence is overwhelming, but Holmes agrees to look into the matter and join forces with Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard.

<doc id="545165" wikidata="Q594841" url="?curid=545165" title="Idiopathic disease">
<text>An idiopathic disease is any disease with an unknown cause or mechanism of apparent origin. 

For some medical conditions, one or more causes are somewhat understood, but in a certain percentage of people with the condition, the cause may not be readily apparent or characterized. In these cases, the origin of the condition is said to be idiopathic. With some other medical conditions, the root cause for a large percentage of all cases has not been established—for example, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis or ankylosing spondylitis; the majority of these cases are deemed idiopathic. Certain medical conditions, when idiopathic, notably some forms of epilepsy and stroke, are preferentially described by the synonymous term of cryptogenic.

==Derivation==
The term &#x27;idiopathic&#x27; derives from Greek ἴδιος &quot;idios&quot; &quot;one&#x27;s own&quot; and πάθος &quot;pathos&quot; &quot;suffering&quot;, so &quot;idiopathy&quot; means approximately &quot;a disease of its own kind&quot;.

==Examples==
Diseases where the cause is seen as wholly or partly idiopathic include:
*Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
*Idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis
*Idiopathic intracranial hypertension
*Idiopathic chronic fatigue
*Granulomatous prostatitis

==Medical advances and this term==
Advances in medical science improve the understanding of causes of diseases and the classification of diseases; thus, regarding any particular condition or disease, as more root causes are discovered and as events that seemed spontaneous have their origins revealed, the percentage of cases designated as idiopathic will decrease. Environmental and occupational risk factors are increasingly being associated with diseases classified as &quot;idiopathic&quot;. Emerging evidence indicates a complex relationship between intrinsic (genetic) and extrinsic (environmental and occupational risk factors) factors in disease physiopathology.

==Usage of synonyms==
The word essential is sometimes synonymous with &quot;idiopathic&quot; (as in essential hypertension, essential thrombocythemia, and essential tremor) and the same is true of primary (as in primary biliary cholangitis, or &quot;primary amenorrhea&quot;), with the latter term being used in such cases to contrast with &quot;secondary&quot; in the sense of &quot;secondary to [i.e., caused by] some other condition.&quot; Another, less common synonym is agnogenic (&quot;agno-&quot;, &quot;unknown&quot; + &quot;-gen&quot;, &quot;cause&quot; + &quot;-ic&quot;). 

The word &quot;cryptogenic&quot; (&quot;&quot;, &quot;hidden&quot; + &quot;-gen&quot;, &quot;cause&quot; + &quot;-ic&quot;) has a sense that is synonymous with &quot;idiopathic&quot; and a sense that is contradistinguished from it. Some disease classifications prefer the use of the synonymous term &quot;cryptogenic disease&quot; as in cryptogenic stroke, and cryptogenic epilepsy. The use of cryptogenic is also sometimes reserved for cases where it is presumed that the cause is simple and will be found in the future.

Some congenital conditions are idiopathic, and sometimes the word &quot;congenital&quot; is used synonymously with &quot;idiopathic&quot;; but careful usage prefers to reserve the word &quot;congenital&quot; for conditions to which the literal sense of the word applies (that is, those whose pathophysiology has existed since the neonatal period).

==Syndrome without a name==
The term syndrome without a name (SWAN) is used &quot;when a child or young adult is believed to have a genetic condition and testing has failed to identify its genetic cause&quot;. It is believed that &quot;about half (50%) of children with learning disabilities and approximately 60% of children with congenital disabilities (disabilities which are apparent from birth) do not have a definitive diagnosis to explain the cause of their difficulties&quot;.

* Embolic stroke of undetermined source

<doc id="545187" wikidata="Q1059532" url="?curid=545187" title="Volcano (1997 film)">
<text>Volcano is a 1997 American disaster film directed by Mick Jackson, written by Jerome Armstrong and Billy Ray, and produced by Neal H. Moritz and Andrew Z. Davis. The film stars Tommy Lee Jones, Anne Heche, Don Cheadle and Keith David. It tells the story of an effort to divert the path of a dangerous lava flow through the streets of Los Angeles following the formation of a volcano at the La Brea Tar Pits. The story was inspired by the 1943 formation of the Parícutin volcano in Mexico.

&quot;Volcano&quot; was released by 20th Century Fox in the United States on April 25, 1997. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $122.8 million worldwide on a $90 million budget and was a box-office success.

==Plot==

In downtown Los Angeles, an earthquake strikes. Mike Roark, the new director of the city&#x27;s Office of Emergency Management, insists on coming to work to help out with the crisis even though he has been on vacation with his daughter Kelly. His associate Emmit Reese notes that the quake caused no major damage, but seven utility workers are later burned to death in a storm drain at MacArthur Park. As a precaution, Mike tries to halt the subway lines near the location of the earthquake. MTA Chairman Stan Olber opposes, believing that there is no threat to the trains. Seismologist Dr. Amy Barnes believes that a volcano may be forming beneath the city due to the earthquake opening a fissure in the fault line; however, she has insufficient evidence to make Mike take action.

Early the following day, Amy and her assistant Rachel venture into the storm sewer to investigate. While they take samples, another — and more powerful — earthquake strikes the city. Rachel falls into a crack and is killed by a rush of hot gases. A subway train derails from falling debris, and a power outage occurs across the entire city. Later, in the La Brea Tar Pits, the small volcano begins to erupt. As Mike helps injured firefighters out of the area, lava begins to flow down Wilshire Boulevard. The lava incinerates everything in its path and kills two firefighters in an overturned fire truck. The Roarks become separated, as Kelly is injured when a lava bomb burns her leg and is taken to Cedars-Sinai Hospital along with other patients. Meanwhile, Stan leads his team through the tunnel to the derailed train to search for survivors. While they save everyone aboard, Stan rescues the driver just as lava reaches the train, causing it to disintegrate. Stan sacrifices his life by jumping into the lava flow to throw the driver to safety.

Mike, Amy, and LAPD lieutenant Ed Fox devise a plan to use concrete barriers to create a blockade, which obstructs the lava in its path. A fleet of helicopters dump water collected from the ocean to subdue the lava and volcano, forming a crust and making the plan a success. However, Amy thinks that the magma is still flowing underground through the subway because of the amount of ash still falling. When Mike helps her confirm her suspicions, she calculates that another eruption will occur at the end of the Red Line at Cedars-Sinai and, after calculating the speed of the flowing lava, determines the lava will reach the end of the tunnel in thirty minutes.

Mike devises another plan to demolish a 22-story condominium building to block the lava&#x27;s path from flowing towards the hospital and the rest of the West Side of Los Angeles, redirecting it into a nearby storm drain. As the lava arrives, Mike&#x27;s co-worker Gator and an LAPD Bomb Squad officer (trapped under debris) sacrifice their lives to detonate the final explosive charge. Mike then spots Kelly nearby, trying to retrieve a little boy she was watching who wandered off; the two are in the direct path of the collapsing building. Mike barely manages to save them from being crushed as the building collapses. The plan succeeds, and the lava flows directly into the ocean. As it begins raining, the trio emerge from the rubble unscathed and reunite with Amy before heading home.

At the tar pits, the volcano has taken shape above ground and has since been named &quot;Mount Wilshire.&quot; It remains active as the movie concludes.

==Cast==
==Production==

===Filming===
Filming was primarily on location in Los Angeles, California. Various filming sites included MacArthur Park, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and the La Brea Tar Pits. Extensive special effects surrounding certain aspects of the film such as the lava flow were created by ten separate digital effects companies including VIFX, Digital Magic Company, Light Matters Inc., Pixel Envy and Anatomorphex. An 80% full-size replica of Wilshire Boulevard, which was one of the largest sets ever constructed in the United States, was assembled in Torrance, California. The computer-generated imagery was coordinated and supervised by Dale Ettema and Mat Beck. Between visuals, miniatures, and animation, over 300 technicians were involved in the production aspects of the special effects.

===Music===
The score for the film was originally composed and orchestrated by musical conductor Alan Silvestri. Recording artists James Newton Howard and Dillinger among others, contributed songs to the music listing. The audio soundtrack in Compact Disc format featuring 8 tracks, was officially released by the American recording label Varèse Sarabande on April 22, 1997. The sound effects in the film were supervised by Christopher Boyes. The mixing of the sound elements were orchestrated by Jim Tanenbaum and Dennis Sands.

==Reception==
Among mainstream critics in the US, &quot;Volcano&quot; received mixed reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reports that 49% of 47 sampled critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 5.10/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Volcano&quot;″s prodigious pyrotechnics and Tommy Lee Jones″ crotchety sneers at lava aren&#x27;t quite enough to save this routine disaster film.&quot; At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average using critical reviews, the film received a score of 55 out of 100 based on 22 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale. In 1997, the film was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award in the category of &quot;Worst Reckless Disregard for Human Life and Public Property&quot;, but lost to &quot;Con Air&quot;.
Janet Maslin wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;&quot;Volcano&quot; begins so excitably and hurtles so quickly into fiery pandemonium,&quot; but noted that &quot;in the disaster realm, it&#x27;s not easy to have it all. A film this technically clever can&#x27;t get away with patronizing and familiar genre cliches.&quot; Roger Ebert in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; called the film a &quot;surprisingly cheesy disaster epic&quot; while musing, &quot;The lava keeps flowing for much of the movie, never looking convincing. I loved it when the firemen aimed their hoses way offscreen into the middle of the lava flow, instead of maybe aiming them at the leading edge of the lava—which they couldn&#x27;t do, because the lava was a visual effect, and not really there.&quot; In the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Mick LaSalle wrote that &quot;Things go bad after &quot;Volcano&quot; plays its last card — the lava — and from there it has nothing to show but more of the same.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said, &quot;&quot;Volcano&quot; is cheese, all right, but it&#x27;s tangy cheese. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever seen a disaster movie in which special effects this realistic and accomplished were put to the service of a premise this outlandish.&quot;

Walter Addiego of the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; opined that &quot;&quot;Volcano&quot; offers a bit of humor, a minimum of plot distraction and the joys of watching molten rock ooze down Wilshire Boulevard.&quot; Left equally impressed was James Berardinelli of &quot;ReelViews&quot;. He described the character of Mike Roark as &quot;a wonderfully heroic figure — a man of action who never has time to rest. The fate of the city rests on his shoulders, and he knows it.&quot; He added: &quot;&quot;Volcano&quot; has opened the &quot;summer&quot; movie season at an astoundingly early late-April date... This isn&#x27;t the kind of film where it&#x27;s worth waiting for the video tape — it&#x27;s too big and brash, and demands the speakers and atmosphere of a state-of-the-art theater.&quot; Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; asserted that the film &quot;glows with heat. Lava heat. The coast may be toast, but it&#x27;s the lava, covering everything like a malevolent tide of melted butter, that makes this a disaster picture that&#x27;s tastier than usual.&quot;
Writing for &quot;Time Out&quot;, author TCh said, &quot;The most striking aspect of this fun, old-fashioned disaster movie is the novelty of seeing the most familiar of backdrops used as a creative resource in its own right.&quot; Not entirely impressed was Margaret McGurk writing for &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;. She stated that the high-caliber special effects were &quot;still fun, but all this lock-step storytelling is wearing thin.&quot; In a hint of commendation, McGurk added, &quot;On its own escapist terms, &quot;Volcano&quot; dishes up a textbook serving of low-I.Q., high-energy entertainment.&quot; Marc Savlov of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; called &quot;Volcano&quot; was a &quot;laughably ridiculous take on what we all secretly dream of: Los Angeles, washed away in a huge, molten tide of cheese — uh, lava, I mean.&quot; Savlov added, &quot;Screenwriters Jerome Armstrong and Billy Ray have crammed the script with...reams of very, very bad dialogue. So bad, in fact, that the screening audience I viewed &quot;Volcano&quot; with seemed to enjoy it immensely, hooting and hollering and laughing as though it were an old episode of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.&quot;

Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wondered why &quot;there&#x27;s no volcano in &quot;Volcano&quot;?...The hokey disaster drama features towering plumes of smoke, a splendid display of fireworks and brimstone, and rivers of molten magma, but I&#x27;ll be darned if there&#x27;s a burning mountain.&quot; Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; was more positive, writing that &quot;first-time screenwriters Jerome Armstrong and Billy Ray waste no time with exposition or scene-setting, starting the fireworks with a nerve-jangling morning earthquake that puts city workers on alert for possible damage.&quot;

<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Abbas Ruby&quot; is a Sherlock Holmes mystery by Adrian Conan Doyle, the youngest son of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the Sherlock Holmes creator. The story was published in the 1954 collection &quot;The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It was first published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on 21 August 1953, and was illustrated by Robert Fawcett in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;. It was also printed in two issues of the magazine &quot;Summertime&quot; in 1965, illustrated by Paul Granger.

==Plot==

Holmes is startled by the sudden appearance during a blizzard of Andrew Joliffe, the butler of horticulturalist Sir John Doverton. During a dinner party, the Abbas Ruby disappeared from the Doverton house, as did all the blooms on Sir John&#x27;s camellia bush. The police arrive at Holmes residence to arrest Joliffe, but not before Joliffe admits that he was the same Joliffe involved in the 
Catterdon Diamond robbery. Before departing with his prisoner, Inspector Gregson of Scotland Yard shows Holmes and Watson the empty jewel case found concealed in Joliffe&#x27;s room.

<text>Raymond Redvers Briggs (18 January 1934 – 9 August 2022) was an English illustrator, cartoonist, graphic novelist and author. Achieving critical and popular success among adults and children, he is best known in Britain for his 1978 story &quot;The Snowman&quot;, a book without words whose cartoon adaptation is televised and whose musical adaptation is staged every Christmas.

Briggs won the 1966 and 1973 Kate Greenaway Medals from the British Library Association, recognising the year&#x27;s best children&#x27;s book illustration by a British subject. For the 50th anniversary of the Medal (1955–2005), a panel named &quot;Father Christmas&quot; (1973) one of the top-ten winning works, which composed the ballot for a public election of the nation&#x27;s favourite. For his contribution as a children&#x27;s illustrator, Briggs was a runner-up for the Hans Christian Andersen Award in 1984. He was a patron of the Association of Illustrators.

==Early life==
Raymond Redvers Briggs was born on 18 January 1934 in Wimbledon, Surrey (now London), to Ernest Redvers Briggs (1900–1971), a milkman, and Ethel Bowyer (1895–1971), a former lady&#x27;s maid-turned-housewife, who married in 1930. During the Second World War, he was evacuated to Dorset before returning to London at the end of the war.

Briggs attended Rutlish School, at that time a grammar school, pursued cartooning from an early age and, despite his father&#x27;s attempts to discourage him from this unprofitable pursuit, attended the Wimbledon School of Art from 1949 to 1953 to study painting, and Central School of Art to study typography.

From 1953 to 1955, he was a National Service conscript in the Royal Corps of Signals at Catterick, where he was made a draughtsman. After this, he returned to study painting at Slade School of Fine Art, graduating in 1957.

==Career==
After briefly pursuing painting, he became a professional illustrator, and soon began working in children&#x27;s books. In 1958, he illustrated &quot;Peter and the Piskies: Cornish Folk and Fairy Tales&quot;, a fairy tale anthology by Ruth Manning-Sanders that was published by Oxford University Press. They would collaborate again for the &quot;Hamish Hamilton Book of Magical Beasts&quot; (Hamilton, 1966). 

In 1961, Briggs began teaching illustration part-time at Brighton School of Art, which he continued until 1986; one of his students was Chris Riddell, who went on to win three Greenaway Medals. Briggs was a commended runner-up for the 1964 Kate Greenaway Medal (&quot;Fee Fi Fo Fum&quot;, a collection of nursery rhymes) and won the 1966 Medal for illustrating a Hamilton edition of Mother Goose. According to a retrospective presentation by the librarians, &quot;The Mother Goose Treasury&quot; &quot;is a collection of 408 traditional and well loved poems and nursery rhymes, illustrated with over 800 colour pictures by a young Raymond Briggs&quot;.

The first three important works that Briggs both wrote and illustrated were in comics format rather than the separate text and illustrations typical of children&#x27;s books; all three were published by Hamish Hamilton. &quot;Father Christmas&quot; (1973) and its sequel &quot;Father Christmas Goes on Holiday&quot; (1975); both feature a curmudgeonly Father Christmas who complains incessantly about the &quot;blooming snow&quot;. For the former, he won his second Greenaway. Much later they were jointly adapted as a film titled &quot;Father Christmas&quot;. The third early Hamilton &quot;comics&quot; was &quot;Fungus the Bogeyman&quot; (1977), featuring a day in the life of a working class bogeyman.

&quot;The Snowman&quot; (Hamilton, 1978) was entirely wordless, and illustrated with only pencil crayons. The work was partly motivated by his previous book; Briggs wrote that &quot;For two years I worked on &quot;Fungus&quot;, buried amongst muck, slime and words, so... I wanted to do something which was clean, pleasant, fresh and wordless and quick.&quot; For that work Briggs was a Highly Commended runner-up for his third Greenaway Medal.
An American edition was produced by Random House in the same year, for which Briggs won the Boston Globe–Horn Book Award, picture book category. In 1982, it was adapted by British TV channel Channel 4 as an animated cartoon, with a short narrated introduction by David Bowie. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 1982, and has since been shown every year on British television (except 1984). On Christmas Eve 2012 the 30th anniversary of the original was marked by the airing of the sequel &quot;The Snowman and the Snowdog&quot;.

Briggs continued to work in a similar format, but with more adult content, in &quot;Gentleman Jim&quot; (1980), a sombre look at the working class trials of Jim and Hilda Bloggs, closely based on his parents. &quot;When the Wind Blows&quot; (1982) confronted the trusting, optimistic Bloggs couple with the horror of nuclear war, and was praised in the House of Commons for its timeliness and originality. The topic was inspired after Briggs watched a &quot;Panorama&quot; documentary on nuclear contingency planning, and the dense format of the page was inspired by a Swiss publisher&#x27;s miniature version of &quot;Father Christmas&quot;. This book was turned into a two-handed radio play with Peter Sallis in the male lead role, and subsequently an animated film, featuring John Mills and Peggy Ashcroft. &quot;The Tin-Pot Foreign General and the Old Iron Woman&quot; (1984) was a denunciation of the Falklands War.

==Personal life and death==
Briggs&#x27;s wife Jean Taprell Clarke, who had schizophrenia, died from leukaemia in 1973, two years after his parents&#x27; death. They did not have any children.

At the end of his life, Briggs lived in a small house in Westmeston, Sussex. His long-term partner, Liz, died in October 2015 having had Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Briggs continued to work on writing and illustrating books.

Briggs died of pneumonia at Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton on 9 August 2022, aged 88.

He is buried in East Chiltington.

==Awards and honours==

Briggs won the 1992 Kurt Maschler Award, or the &quot;Emil&quot;, both for writing and for illustrating &quot;The Man&quot;, a short graphic novel featuring a boy and a homunculus. The award annually recognised one British children&#x27;s book for integration of text and illustration. His graphic novel &quot;Ethel &amp; Ernest&quot;, which portrayed his parents&#x27; 41-year marriage, won Best Illustrated Book in the 1999 British Book Awards. In 2016, it was turned into a hand-drawn animated film. In 2012, he was the first person to be inducted into the British Comic Awards Hall of Fame.

In 2014, Briggs received the Phoenix Picture Book Award from the Children&#x27;s Literature Association for &quot;The Bear&quot; (1994). The award committee stated:

With surprising page-turns, felicitous pauses, and pitch-perfect dialogue, Briggs renders the drama and humour of child–adult and child–bear relations, while questioning the nature of imagination and reality. As a picture book presented in graphic novel format, Briggs&#x27;s work was ground-breaking when first published and remains cutting edge twenty years later in its creative unity of text and picture.

The biennial Hans Christian Andersen Award conferred by the International Board on Books for Young People is the highest recognition available to a writer or illustrator of children&#x27;s books. Briggs was one of two runners-up for the illustration award in 1984.

He has also won several awards for particular works.

<text>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a collection of short stories by British writer Arthur Conan Doyle, first published on 14 October 1892. It contains the earliest short stories featuring the consulting detective Sherlock Holmes, which had been published in twelve monthly issues of &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; from July 1891 to June 1892. The stories are collected in the same sequence, which is not supported by any fictional chronology. The only characters common to all twelve are Holmes and Dr. Watson, and all are related in first-person narrative from Watson&#x27;s point of view.

In general the stories in &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; identify, and try to correct, social injustices. Holmes is portrayed as offering a new, fairer sense of justice. The stories were well received, and boosted the subscriptions figures of &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;, prompting Doyle to be able to demand more money for his next set of stories. The first story, &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;, includes the character of Irene Adler, who, despite being featured only within this one story by Doyle, is a prominent character in modern Sherlock Holmes adaptations, often as a love interest for Holmes. Doyle included four of the stories from this collection in his twelve favourite Sherlock Holmes stories, picking &quot;The Adventure of the Speckled Band&quot; as his overall favourite.

==Context==

Arthur Conan Doyle began writing while studying medicine at university in the late 1870s, and had his first short story, &quot;The Mystery of Sasassa Valley&quot;, published in September 1879. Eight years later his first Sherlock Holmes story, the novel &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;, was published by Ward Lock &amp; Co. It was well received, but Doyle was paid little for it; after a sequel novel, &quot;The Sign of the Four&quot;, was published in &quot;Lippincott&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot;, he shifted his focus to short stories. Soon after &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; was inaugurated in January 1891, its editor Herbert Greenhough Smith received two submissions to the new monthly from Doyle. Later he described his reaction: &quot;I at once realised that here was the greatest short story writer since Edgar Allan Poe.&quot; The first of them, &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;, was published near the back of the July issue with ten illustrations by Sidney Paget. The stories proved popular, helping to boost the circulation of the magazine, and Doyle was paid 30 guineas each for the initial run of twelve. These first twelve stories were published monthly from July 1891 until June 1892, and then were collected together and published as a book, &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; on 14 October 1892 by George Newnes, the publisher of &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;. The initial print run of the book was for 10,000 copies in the United Kingdom, and a further 4,500 copies in the United States, which were published by Harper Brothers the following day.

Sidney Paget illustrated all twelve stories in &quot;The Strand&quot; and in the collection. The preceding Holmes novels had been illustrated by other artists.

==Stories==

===Summary===
All of the stories within &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; are told in a first-person narrative from the point of view of Dr. Watson, as is the case for all but four of the Sherlock Holmes stories. The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; entry for Doyle suggests that the short stories contained in &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; tend to point out social injustices, such as &quot;a king&#x27;s betrayal of an opera singer, a stepfather&#x27;s deception of his ward as a fictitious lover, an aristocratic crook&#x27;s exploitation of a failing pawnbroker, a beggar&#x27;s extensive estate in Kent.&quot; It suggests that, in contrast, Holmes is portrayed as offering a fresh and fair approach in an unjust world of &quot;official incompetence and aristocratic privilege&quot;. &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; contains many of Doyle&#x27;s favourite Sherlock Holmes stories. In 1927, he submitted a list of what he believed were his twelve best Sherlock Holmes stories to &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;. Among those he listed were &quot;The Adventure of the Speckled Band&quot; (as his favourite), &quot;The Red-Headed League&quot; (second), &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; (fifth) and &quot;The Five Orange Pips&quot; (seventh). The book was banned in the Soviet Union in 1929 because of its alleged &quot;occultism&quot;, but gained popularity in a black market of similarly banned books, and the restriction was lifted in 1940.

===Publication sequence===
==Critical reception==

&quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; were well received upon their serialisation in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;.
Following the publication of &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; in July 1891, the &quot;Hull Daily Mail&quot; described the story as being &quot;worthy of the inventive genius&quot; of Doyle. Just over a year later, when Doyle took a break from publishing the short stories upon the completion of &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a piece in the &quot;Belfast News Letter&quot; reviewed a story by another author in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; saying that it &quot;might have been read with a moderate amount of interest a year ago&quot;, but that &quot;the unique power&quot; of Doyle&#x27;s writing was evident in the gulf in quality between the stories. The &quot;Leeds Mercury&quot; particularly praised the characterisation of Holmes, &quot;with all his little foibles&quot;, while in contrast the &quot;Cheltenham Looker-On&quot; described Holmes as &quot;rather a bore sometimes&quot;, noting that descriptions of his foibles &quot;grows wearisome&quot;. The correspondent for &quot;Hampshire Telegraph&quot; lamented the fact that Doyle&#x27;s more thoughtful writing, such as &quot;Micah Clarke&quot;, was not so popular as the Holmes stories, concluding that an author &quot;who wishes to make literature pay must write what his readers want&quot;.

==Adaptations==
Sherlock Holmes has been adapted numerous times for both films and plays, and the character has been played by over 70 different actors in more than 200 films. A number of film and television series have borne the title &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, but some of these are either original stories, combinations of a number of Doyle&#x27;s stories, or in one case, an adaptation of &quot;The Sign of the Four&quot;.

Irene Adler, who is in the first short story, &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;, is prominent in many modern adaptations, despite only appearing in one story. Often in modern adaptations, she is portrayed as a love interest for Holmes, as in Robert Doherty&#x27;s &quot;Elementary&quot; and the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock&quot;, even though in the story itself, the narration claims: &quot;It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler.&quot; In his &quot;Sherlock Holmes Handbook&quot;, Christopher Redmond notes &quot;the Canon provides little basis for either sentimental or prurient speculation about a Holmes-Adler connection.&quot;

Multiple series have featured adaptations of all or nearly all of the stories in this collection, including the 1921–1923 Stoll film series (all except &quot;The Five Orange Pips&quot;), the radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1930–1936), the 1939–1950 radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (all except &quot;The Beryl Coronet&quot;), and the BBC Sherlock Holmes 1952–1969 radio series. Many of the stories from the collection were included as episodes in the Granada Television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; which ran from 1984 until 1994. The stories in &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; were dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1990–1991 as part of the BBC Sherlock Holmes 1989–1998 radio series, and were adapted as episodes of the radio series &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (2005–2016). The stories within the collection have also been adapted for many other productions.

<doc id="545250" wikidata="Q232141" url="?curid=545250" title="University of Chile">
<text>The University of Chile () is a public research university in Santiago, Chile. It was founded on November 19, 1842, and inaugurated on September 17, 1843. It is the oldest university in the country. It was established as the continuation of the former colonial Royal University of San Felipe (1738) (Spanish: &quot;Real Universidad de San Felipe&quot;), and has a rich history in academic, scientific and social outreach. The university seeks to solve national and regional issues and to contribute to the development of Chile. It is recognized as one of the best universities in Latin America for its leadership and innovation in science, technology, social sciences, and arts through the functions of creation, extension, teaching, and research. It is considered the most important and prestigious university in the country.

Its five campuses comprise more than of research buildings, health care centers, museums, theaters, observatories, and sports infrastructure. The institution has more than 40,000 undergraduate and graduate students, offering more than 60 different bachelor and professional degrees, 38 doctoral programs and 116 master programs.

Notable alumni include Nobel laureates Pablo Neruda and Gabriela Mistral, twenty-one Chilean presidents including the current president Gabriel Boric, and two presidents from other countries (Mexico and Ecuador).

==Rankings and quality accreditation==
The QS University Ranking ranks the University of Chile as the fourth in Latin America and 180 in the world for year 2021. The school boasts an outstanding 100 points in both Academic and Employer Reputation categories. The world ranking of universities, elaborated by Shanghai JiaoTong University (China) and the European Union based on research sciences indicators, places it among the 400 best universities in the world. SCImago Institutions Rankings (SIR) makes a characterization of institutions based on research, innovation and visibility on the web, and in 2017 report on investigation, which included more than 4,500 institutions of higher education and other centers in the world, the University of Chile ranked first in Chile, 10 in Latin America and 424 in the world.

Another study which highlights the performance of this institution is the Ranking Web of Universities (Webometrics), which measures the presence and impact on the web of over 11,000 universities and qualifies this college as leader of the country, six in Latin America and 371 worldwide.

In the 2016 version of the ranking made by AméricaEconomía, University of Chile was ranked first in Chile with the top rating in quality indicators of research, accreditation, infrastructure and inclusion.

===Accreditation===
On December 21, 2011, the University of Chile was notified by the National Accreditation Commission (CNA) of the positive evaluation in all obligatory areas (institutional management and undergraduate teaching) and electives (research, teaching graduate and linkage with medium). Thus the university is accredited by seven years, the maximum awarded by the agency, for the period between 2011 and 2018.

The University of Chile, the Catholic University, University of Santiago, Catholic University of Valparaíso and the University of Concepción are the only institutions in this country that have the highest accreditation.

== History ==
In 1841 the minister of public education, Manuel Montt, conceived the idea of funding a corporation for the &quot;advancement and development of sciences and humanities&quot;. Andrés Bello a Venezuelan poet and humanist, formulated the project which with small modifications became a law on November 19, 1842, creating the Universidad de Chile.

The foundation answered the need to modernize the country which a little more than two decades before had become independent from Spain. It replaced the Real Universidad de San Felipe, which was established in 1738.

The university was formally opened on September 17, 1843. During this period, the university consisted of five faculties (facultades): Humanities &amp; Philosophy, Physical &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Law &amp; Political Sciences, Medicine, and Theology. During its first years the university gave considerable support to education, institutional organization (such as the &quot;Civil Code&quot;, a model for America), the building of the road network to join the territory, and the energy and production infrastructure.

By 1931, the number of colleges had increased to six: Philosophy &amp; Education Sciences, Legal &amp; Social Sciences, Biology &amp; Medical Sciences, Physical &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Agronomy &amp; Veterinary, and Fine Arts.

The institution has also contributed to the formation of the intellectual elites and leaders of the country. Most of the Chilean presidents have studied in its lecture halls, as well as people with prominent roles in politics, business and culture.

=== Major reforms during the military regime of 1973–1989 ===

During Augusto Pinochet&#x27;s military regime from 1973 to 1989, the university experienced many profound changes. On October 2, 1973, Decree number 50 of 1973 stated that the university&#x27;s presidents would be designated by the military regime.

The second major change came on January 3, 1981, when another decree completely restructured the university. All of its provincial campuses were separated, cojoined with provincial campuses of the Universidad Técnica del Estado (now Universidad de Santiago de Chile and Universidad de Atacama) and designated as separate universities, such as the Universidad de Talca, Universidad de Valparaiso, the Instituto Pedagógico (Pedagogical Institute, now the Universidad Metropolitana de Ciencias de la Educación), the Universidad de Antofagasta, the Universidad de Tarapacá, Instituto Professional de Osorno (now Universidad de los Lagos), Instituto Professional de Chillán (now Universidad del Bío-Bío), Universidad de la Frontera, and Universidad de la Serena. Some faculties, such as the one located in avenida Portugal and which now belongs to the Universidad Mayor, were privatized and sold at bargain prices to Pinochet cronies.

These changes were orchestrated by influential advisors to the dictatorship as a way to moderate the university&#x27;s influence on the nation&#x27;s politics, economics, public policies and intellectual movements, considered leftist by Augusto Pinochet and other right-wing government officials.

In spite of the complete restructuring of the University of Chile, it still remains Chile&#x27;s most prestigious university in terms of research, applicant preferences and social impact.

== Organization ==
The university&#x27;s community involves the collaboration of academics, students and staff, who perform the tasks that establish its mission and functions.

===Government===

<doc id="545253" wikidata="Q215057" url="?curid=545253" title="Rick Perry">
<text>James Richard Perry (born March 4, 1950) is an American politician who served as the 14th United States secretary of energy from 2017 to 2019 in the first administration of Donald Trump. He previously served as the 47th governor of Texas from 2000 to 2015 and ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in the 2012 and 2016 elections.

Born into a family of cotton farmers in Haskell, Texas, Perry graduated from Texas A&amp;M University in 1972 and entered into the United States Air Force, serving a five-year stint and achieving the rank of captain. After leaving the Air Force in 1977, Perry returned to Texas and entered politics, serving as a member of the Texas House of Representatives from 1985 to 1991. Initially a Democrat, Perry switched parties in 1989 and became a Republican, and was elected Agriculture Commissioner of Texas the following year. In 1998, Perry was elected Lieutenant Governor of Texas, becoming the state&#x27;s first Republican Lieutenant Governor since Reconstruction.

Perry assumed the governorship of Texas in December 2000, after Governor George W. Bush resigned following his election as President. Perry was re-elected Governor three times, becoming the longest-serving governor in Texas history. As Governor, Perry identified as a staunch conservative, enacting conservative fiscal policies, restrictions on abortion and expanded gun rights. Long considered a potential presidential candidate, Perry officially announced his candidacy for the 2012 Republican nomination for President in August 2011. Perry initially performed well in polling and showed strong fundraising prowess, leading to him being considered a serious contender for the nomination. However, his support declined following debates and early primaries, and he withdrew from the race in January 2012.

Perry declined to seek re-election to a fourth term as Governor and left office in 2015, launching a second presidential campaign shortly thereafter. Perry&#x27;s second presidential campaign failed to garner substantial polling support, fundraising or media attention, leading him to withdraw from the race after only three months. Perry was initially a vocal opponent of Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 campaign for President, however, he later endorsed Trump after he secured the Republican nomination. After winning the presidency, Trump appointed Perry as Secretary of Energy, and he was confirmed by the United States Senate in a 62–37 vote on March 2, 2017. On October 17, 2019, Perry reported to Trump that he intended to resign as Secretary of Energy at the end of the year. He left office on December 1, 2019.

==Early life==
A fifth-generation Texan, Perry was born on March 4, 1950, in Haskell, Texas, and raised in Paint Creek, Texas, the son of dryland cotton farmers Joseph Ray Perry and Amelia June Holt Perry. He has one older sister. Perry&#x27;s ancestry is almost entirely English, dating as far back as the original Thirteen Colonies. His family has been in Texas since before the Texas Revolution.

His father, a Democrat, was a long-time Haskell County commissioner and school board member. Perry has said that his interest in politics probably began in November 1961, when his father took him to the funeral of U.S. Representative Sam Rayburn.

Perry was in the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) and earned the rank of Eagle Scout. The BSA has honored Perry with the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award.

===College===
Perry attended Texas A&amp;M University where he was a member of the Corps of Cadets and the Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity. He was elected senior class social secretary, a member and redpot in Aggie Bonfire, and one of A&amp;M&#x27;s five &quot;yell leaders&quot;. He graduated in 1972 with a Bachelor of Science degree in animal science.

In 1989, he said, &quot;I was probably a bit of a free spirit, not particularly structured real well for life outside of a military regime, I would have not lasted at Texas Tech or the University of Texas. I would have hit the fraternity scene and lasted about one semester.&quot;

===First jobs===
In the early 1970s, Perry interned during several summers with Southwestern Advantage, as a door-to-door book salesman. &quot;I count my time working for Dortch Oldham [then president of the Southwestern family of companies] as one of the most important formative experiences of my life&quot;, Perry said in 2010. &quot;There is nothing that tests your commitment to a goal like getting a few doors closed in your face.&quot; He said that &quot;Mr. Oldham taught legions of young people to communicate quickly, clearly and with passion, a lesson that has served me well in my life since then.&quot;

Upon graduation from college in 1972, Perry was commissioned as an officer in the United States Air Force and completed pilot training in February 1974. He was then assigned as a Lockheed C-130 Hercules pilot with the 772nd Tactical Airlift Squadron at Dyess Air Force Base, located in Abilene, Texas. Perry&#x27;s duties included two-month overseas rotations at RAF Mildenhall, located in Mildenhall, England, and Rhein-Main Air Base, located at Frankfurt am Main, Germany. His missions included a 1974 U.S. State Department drought relief effort in Mali, Mauritania and Chad, and, in 1976, earthquake relief in Guatemala. He left the Air Force in 1977 at the rank of captain, returned to Texas, and went into farming cotton with his father.

==Early political career==
===Texas Legislature===
In 1984, Perry was elected to the Texas House of Representatives as a Democrat from district 64, which included his home county of Haskell. He served on the House Appropriations and Calendars committees during his three two-year terms in office. He befriended fellow freshman state representative Lena Guerrero, a staunch liberal Democrat who endorsed Perry&#x27;s reelection bid in 2006.

Perry was part of the &quot;Pit Bulls&quot;, a group of Appropriations members who sat on the lower dais in the committee room (&quot;the pit&quot;) who pushed for austere state budgets during the 1980s. At one point, &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; named him one of the ten most effective members of the legislature.

In 1987, Perry voted for a $5.7 billion tax increase proposed by Republican Governor Bill Clements. Perry supported Al Gore in the 1988 Democratic presidential primaries and worked for Gore&#x27;s campaign in Texas. On September 29, 1989, Perry announced that he was switching parties, becoming a Republican. On a guest appearance on Fox show Hannity, he partially credits Reagan as part of the reason he became a Republican, also stating he switched political parties sooner in his life than Reagan.

===Agriculture Commissioner===
In 1990, as a newly minted Republican, Perry challenged Jim Hightower, the incumbent Democratic Agriculture Commissioner. Karl Rove was Perry&#x27;s campaign manager.

In the Republican primary on March 13, 1990, Perry polled 276,558 votes (47%), with Richard McIver garnering 176,976 votes (30%) and Gene L. Duke, who placed third, polling 132,497 votes (23%). Since Perry fell shy of the necessary 50% to win outright, a runoff was held between Perry and McIver set on April 10, 1990. In the runoff, he emerged victorious, garnering 96,649 votes (69%) to McIver&#x27;s 43,921 votes (31%).

During 1990, Hightower&#x27;s office was embroiled in an FBI investigation into corruption and bribery. Three aides were convicted in 1993 of using public funds for political fundraising, although Hightower himself was not found to be involved in the wrongdoings. Perry narrowly defeated Hightower in November 1990, garnering 1,864,463 votes (49%) to Hightower&#x27;s 1,820,145 votes (48%).

Rove raised $3 million to raise Perry&#x27;s profile, &quot;while tarnishing the name of Jim Hightower&quot; resulting in Perry&#x27;s name becoming a &quot;household name in Texas—and Hightower&#x27;s name synonymous with corruption&quot;.

As Agriculture Commissioner, Perry was responsible for promoting the sale of Texas farm produce to other states and foreign nations, and for supervising the calibration of weights and measures, such as gasoline pumps and grocery store scales.

In April 1993, Perry, while serving as Texas agriculture commissioner, expressed support for the effort to reform the nation&#x27;s healthcare, describing it as &quot;most commendable&quot;. The healthcare plan, first revealed in September, was ultimately unsuccessful due to Republican congressional opposition. In 2005, after being questioned on the issue by a potential opponent in the Republican governor primary, Perry said he expressed his support only in order to get Clinton to pay more attention to rural healthcare.

In 1994, Perry was reelected Agriculture Commissioner by a large margin, getting 2,546,287 votes (62 percent) to Democrat Marvin Gregory&#x27;s 1,479,692 (36 percent). Libertarian Clyde L. Garland received the remaining 85,836 votes (2 percent). Gregory, a chicken farmer from Sulphur Springs, Texas, was on the Texas Agricultural Finance Authority with Perry in the early nineties as a Republican but became a Democrat before running against Perry in 1994.

===Lieutenant governor===
In 1998, Perry ran for lieutenant governor. During this election, Perry had a notable falling out with his previous top political strategist Karl Rove, which began the much-reported rivalry between the Bush and Perry camps. Perry polled 1,858,837 votes (50.04 percent) to the 1,790,106 (48.19 percent) cast for Democrat John Sharp. Perry became the state&#x27;s first Republican lieutenant governor since Reconstruction, taking office on January 19, 1999.

==Governor of Texas==

Perry assumed the office of governor on December 21, 2000, following the resignation of George W. Bush—who was preparing to become President of the United States. He won the office in his own right in the 2002 gubernatorial election, where he received 58% of votes to Laredo oilman and businessman Tony Sanchez&#x27;s 40%. He was re-elected in the 2006 gubernatorial election against three major opponents, polling 39% of votes against runner-up former U.S. Congressman Chris Bell of Houston with 30%. Former Republican Comptroller, Carole Keeton Strayhorn, running as an independent, garnered 18% of the vote and comic/author/musician, Kinky Friedman, also running as an independent, garnered over 12%. In the 2010 gubernatorial election, Perry became the first Texas governor to be elected to three four-year terms, polling 55% of votes to former Houston Mayor Bill White&#x27;s 42%.

In the 2001 legislative session, Perry set a record for his use of the veto, rejecting 82 acts, more than any other governor in any single legislative session in the history of the state since Reconstruction.

Perry is one of five governors of Texas to have served three terms, the others being Allan Shivers, Price Daniel, John Connally and later Greg Abbott. He is the longest-serving governor in Texas history. He had served for 14 years by the time he left office, making him the second longest-serving U.S. governor at the time, behind Terry Branstad of Iowa.

=== Fiscal policies ===
In his presidential campaign, Perry highlighted the economic success Texas achieved under his governorship. The efficacy of Perry&#x27;s economic policies has been questioned by some sources.

A proclaimed proponent of fiscal conservatism, Perry often campaigned on job growth and tax issues, such as his opposition to creating a state income tax. In 2002, Perry refused to promise not to raise taxes as governor, and in the following years did propose or approve various tax and debt increases. In 2009, Perry signed Grover Norquist&#x27;s pledge to &quot;oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes&quot;.

Texas began borrowing money in 2003 to pay for roads and was projected to owe $17.3 billion by the end of 2012, increasing total state debt from $13.4 billion in 2001 to $37.8 billion in 2011. The state&#x27;s public finance authority sold $2 billion in bonds for unemployment benefits, and it was authorized to sell $1.5 billion more if necessary. Texas federal borrowing topped $1.6 billion in October 2010, before the bond sales.

In 2003, Perry signed legislation that created the Texas Enterprise Fund, which has since given $435 million in grants to businesses. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that many of the companies receiving grants, or their chief executives, have made contributions to Perry&#x27;s campaigns or to the Republican Governors Association. (Perry became chairman of the group in 2008 and again in 2011.) Perry was criticized for supporting corporate tax breaks and other incentives, while the state government was experiencing budget deficits.

===Healthcare===
As governor, Perry was an opponent of federal health-care reform proposals and of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, describing the latter as &quot;socialism on American soil&quot;. His focus in Texas was on tort reform, signing a bill in 2003 that restricted non-economic damages in medical malpractice judgments. Perry touted this approach in his presidential campaign, although independent analysts have concluded that it has failed to increase the supply of physicians or limit health-care costs in Texas.

During Perry&#x27;s governorship, Texas rose from second to first among states with the highest proportion of uninsured residents at 26%, and had the lowest level of access to prenatal care in the U.S. Perry and the state legislature cut Medicaid spending. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that under Perry, &quot;working Texans increasingly have been priced out of private healthcare while the state&#x27;s safety net has withered.&quot;

Perry&#x27;s office said that Texas represents a model private-sector approach to healthcare. His spokeswoman said, &quot;Texas does provide an adequate safety net to those truly in need... and many individuals simply choose not to purchase healthcare coverage.&quot;

Perry is anti-abortion and has signed bills with rules or restrictions for abortion procedures and funding for them.

In December 2011, Perry said he had undergone a &quot;transformation&quot; and now opposed abortions, even in cases of rape and incest. The next day he clarified that he would allow an exception for abortions that would save a mother&#x27;s life.

In February 2007, Perry issued an executive order mandating that Texas girls receive the HPV vaccine, which protects against some strains of the human papilloma virus, a contributing factor to some forms of cervical cancer. Following the move, news outlets reported various apparent financial connections between Perry and the vaccine&#x27;s manufacturer, Merck. Merck&#x27;s political action committee has contributed $28,500 since 2001 to Perry&#x27;s campaigns. Perry later reversed his position, calling the vaccine mandate a &quot;mistake&quot;. In May 2007, the Texas Legislature passed a bill undoing the order; Perry did not veto the bill, saying the veto would have been overruled, but blamed lawmakers who supported the bill for the deaths of future Texan cervical cancer victims.

On July 1, 2011, Perry both had adult stem cell surgery in Houston and started &quot;laying the groundwork&quot; for the commercialization of the adult stem cell industry in Texas.

===Religion===
Perry grew up in the United Methodist Church. He and his family were members of Tarrytown United Methodist Church in Austin until 2010, when they began attending Lake Hills Church, a non-denominational evangelical megachurch in western Travis County. Perry told the &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot; that he began attending Lake Hills because it was close to the rental home where he and his wife lived while the Governor&#x27;s Mansion was being renovated.

In 2006, Perry said he believed in the inerrancy of the Bible and that those who do not accept Jesus as their Savior will go to hell. A couple of days later, he clarified, &quot;I don&#x27;t know that there&#x27;s any human being that has the ability to interpret what God and his final decision-making is going to be.&quot;

In his 2008 book &quot;On My Honor&quot;, Perry expressed his views on the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the U.S. Constitution. &quot;Let&#x27;s be clear: I don&#x27;t believe government, which taxes people regardless of their faith, should espouse a specific faith. I also don&#x27;t think we should allow a small minority of atheists to sanitize our civil dialogue of religious references.&quot;

In June 2011, Perry proclaimed August 6 as a Day of Prayer and Fasting, inviting other governors to join him in a prayer meeting hosted by the American Family Association in Houston. The event was criticized as going beyond prayer and fasting to include launching Perry&#x27;s presidential campaign.

Perry has called himself &quot;a firm believer in intelligent design as a matter of faith and intellect&quot; and has expressed support for its teaching alongside evolution in Texas schools but has also said that &quot;educators and local school officials, not the governor, should determine science curriculum&quot;.

===Education===
In 2005, Perry said he would not &quot;approve an education budget that shortchanges teacher salary increases, textbooks, education technology, and education reforms. And I cannot let $2 billion sit in some bank account when it can go directly to the classroom&quot;.

Following a second rejection of Perry&#x27;s bill, Perry asked John Sharp to head a task force charged with preparing a bipartisan education plan, which was subsequently adopted.

In 2001, Perry expressed his pride in the enactment of the statute extending in-state tuition to undocumented immigrants who meet Texas&#x27; residency requirements. It also required the undocumented students to pledge to apply for permanent residency or citizenship if this became a possibility for them. In September 2014, Gov. Perry stated during a debate his continuous support for the program.

===LGBT rights===
Perry is a firm opponent of LGBT rights and as both Governor of Texas and Secretary of Energy became controversial for his homophobic comments and anti-LGBT positions.

In 2002, Perry described the Texas same-sex anti-sodomy law as &quot;appropriate&quot;. The following year, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the statute in &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;, determining that it violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.

In his 2010 book, Perry referenced the &quot;Lawrence&quot; decision, writing &quot;Texans have a different view of the world than do the nine oligarchs in robes.&quot; In 2011, Perry admitted that he did not know about the &quot;Lawrence&quot; decision; when told that the Supreme Court case had struck down Texas&#x27;s anti-sodomy law, Perry said: &quot;I&#x27;m not taking the bar exam [...]I don&#x27;t know what a lot of legal cases [...] My position on traditional marriage is clear [...] I don&#x27;t need a federal law case to explain it to me.&quot;

Perry supported Texas Proposition 2 in 2005, a ballot proposition that amended the Texas constitution by defining marriage as &quot;only a union between a man and a woman&quot; and prohibiting the state from creating or recognizing &quot;any legal status identical or similar to marriage&quot; (such as civil unions).

In 2011, after New York legalized same-sex marriage, Perry said it was their right to do so under the principle of states&#x27; rights in the Tenth Amendment. A spokesman later reiterated Perry&#x27;s support for a federal constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, saying that position was not inconsistent, since an amendment would require ratification by three-fourths of the states.

After the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; in 2015 that the fundamental right to marry is guaranteed to same-sex couples by the Constitution, Perry condemned the decision, saying: &quot;I&#x27;m a firm believer in traditional marriage, and I also believe the 10th Amendment leaves it to each state to decide this issue.&quot;

In his first book, &quot;On My Honor&quot;, published in 2008, Perry compared homosexuality to alcoholism, writing that he is &quot;no expert on the &#x27;nature versus nurture&#x27; debate&quot; but gays should simply choose abstinence. Perry&#x27;s comments created immense controversy and drew ire from several LGBT rights groups.

During the 2012 presidential campaign, he criticized the repeal of the &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; policy for the U.S. military. In a 2011 campaign ad, he stated: &quot;there&#x27;s something wrong in this country when gays can serve openly in the military&quot; and later defended the ad, saying he was &quot;very comfortable&quot; with it. Perry said using foreign aid as a policy tool against foreign countries that violate the human rights of homosexuals was &quot;not in America&#x27;s interests&quot; and was part of a &quot;war on traditional American values&quot;.

Perry, an Eagle Scout, called on the Boy Scouts in 2013 to continue their ban on homosexuality.

===Crime===
Perry&#x27;s campaigns for lieutenant governor and governor focused on a tough stance on crime. He has supported block grants for crime programs.

Jeff L. Blackburn, chief counsel of the Innocence Project of Texas, said of Perry that &quot;He has done more good than any other governor we&#x27;ve ever had [...] unless, of course, it involves the death penalty. On the death penalty, Rick Perry has a profound mental block.&quot;

In 2007, Perry signed a law ending automatic arrest for cannabis possession.

===Death penalty===
Perry supports the death penalty. In June 2001, he vetoed a ban on the execution of mentally retarded inmates. In 2011, during a televised debate for presidential candidates, he said he had &quot;never struggled&quot; with the question of the possible innocence of any of the 234 inmates executed to date while he was governor.

Cases in which Perry has been criticized for his lack of intervention include those of Cameron Todd Willingham and Mexican nationals José Medellín and Humberto Leal Garcia.

Perry commuted the death sentence of Kenneth Foster, who was convicted of murder despite evidence that he was only present at the scene of the crime. Foster was convicted under a Texas law that makes co-conspirators liable in certain cases of homicide. In this case, it tied Foster to the triggerman. Perry raised doubts about the law and urged the legislature to re-examine the issue. &quot;I believe the right and just decision is to commute Foster&#x27;s sentence from the death penalty to life imprisonment,&quot; Perry said.

Perry also refused to grant a stay of execution in 2004 in the case of Cameron Todd Willingham, even though an investigation by the Texas Forensic Science Commission determined parts of the original investigation may not have looked at all of the evidence correctly. Perry said in 2009 that &quot;Willingham was a monster. He was a guy who murdered his three children, who tried to beat his wife into an abortion so that he wouldn&#x27;t have those kids. Person after person has stood up and testified to facts of this case that quite frankly you all aren&#x27;t covering&quot; and later replaced the chairman and other members of the Science Commission prior to a meeting on the case. The replacements were believed to potentially related to the election slated for the following year.

===Infrastructure===
In 2002, Perry proposed the Trans-Texas Corridor (TTC), a $175 billion transportation network that would include a 4,000-mile network of highways, rail, and utility lines and would be funded by private investors. Plans for the project were dropped in 2009 in favor of more incremental road projects. Opposition to the project, also called the &quot;NAFTA super highway&quot; garnered opposition from rural Texans, labor and environmentalists, the project became a major issue in the 2006 gubernatorial campaign.

===Gun ownership===
Perry has an A+ rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund. He possesses a Concealed Carry License (CCL) and has signed a number of bills that increased CCL access.

===Mexico border===
In 2005, Perry launched Operation Linebacker, which was intended to prevent terrorists from exploiting the Texas-Mexico border. There was no evidence that terrorists attempted to exploit the border. Perry touted the border security efforts as he campaigned for re-election. During Perry&#x27;s governorship, he launched additional operations and persuaded the Texas legislature to devote more taxpayers&#x27; resources to border security. According to a 2022 investigative report by the Texas Tribune, &quot;The way the governors and their administrations have tracked success has fluctuated over the years, offering little clarity into whether the state is closer to securing the border today than it was nearly 20 years ago. Neither the governor&#x27;s office nor the DPS, the main agency leading border security efforts, can provide a full breakdown of the state-led operations since 2005, their duration, their cost to taxpayers and their accomplishments.&quot;

During a large surge in illegal immigration through the U.S. southern border in the summer of 2014, Perry criticized U.S. President Barack Obama, saying the surge was &quot;a humanitarian crisis that he has the ability to stop&quot;. On July 21, 2014, Perry announced he would send in 1,000 National Guard troops to secure the border. Although illegal immigration levels declined over 70% after Perry deployed the National Guard, PolitiFact.com rated his claim that the decline resulted from the surge as &quot;mostly false&quot;.

In 2016, &quot;The Texas Tribune&quot; wrote that &quot;Perry has long been a critic of building a wall or fence along the border.&quot; After Trump won the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, Perry fully embraced Trump&#x27;s proposed border wall.

===Veto controversy and exoneration===
On August 15, 2014, Perry was indicted by a Travis County grand jury. The first charge of the indictment was abuse of official capacity, which has since been ruled unconstitutional, for threatening to veto $7.5 million in funding for the Public Integrity Unit, a state public corruption prosecutors department. The second charge, which has also since been ruled unconstitutional, was coercion of a public servant, for seeking the resignation of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, a Democrat, after she was convicted of drunk driving and incarcerated.

Perry pleaded not guilty to both charges. Perry&#x27;s supporters called the charges political and partisan, and several Democratic commentators, including David Axelrod, believed charges were weak.

In February 2016, Perry was cleared of all charges.

The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled that courts could not limit veto power and that prosecuting Perry over his action violates &quot;the separation of powers provision of the Texas Constitution&quot; and infringed on Perry&#x27;s First Amendment right to freedom of speech.

===Retirement as governor===
By the end of his third full term, he had served more than 14 consecutive years in office. A University of Texas at Austin–&quot;Texas Tribune&quot; poll released in June 2013, showed Perry leading potential primary challenger Attorney General Greg Abbott by double digits, 45–19%. In February, the same poll had Perry leading by a 3-to-1 margin (49–17%) of 32 points over Abbott.

However, Perry decided not to run for re-election to a fourth full term, announcing in front of family and supporters at the Holt Cat headquarters in San Antonio on July 8, 2013, that he would retire instead.

Perry retired with the 10th longest gubernatorial tenure in United States history at the end of his term on January 20, 2015, at days as well as the record of the longest serving Texas Governor.

==2012 presidential campaign==

Perry was considered as a potential candidate since as early as the 2008 presidential election, initially denying he was interested in the office but later becoming more open-minded. He formally launched his campaign on August 13, 2011, in Charleston, South Carolina.

While he was initially successful in fundraising and was briefly considered a serious contender for the nomination, he struggled during the debates and his poll numbers began to decline. After finishing fifth with just over 10% of the vote in the Iowa caucuses on January 3, 2012, Perry considered dropping out of the presidential race but did not. After a poor showing in New Hampshire and with &quot;lagging&quot; poll numbers in South Carolina, Perry formally announced he was suspending his campaign on January 19, 2012.

==2016 presidential campaign==

Almost immediately following the 2012 election, Perry was mentioned as a potential candidate for the presidency in the 2016 presidential election, with a &quot;Time&quot; magazine article in July 2013 saying that &quot;everything is aligned for Rick Perry to be the Republican nominee for president in 2016.&quot;

Perry officially launched his 2016 presidential candidacy on June 4, 2015, in Addison, Texas. A version of the Colt Ford song &quot;Answer To No One&quot; boomed from loudspeakers, as Perry took to the stage. He then announced his candidacy at the scheduled press conference.

Perry withdrew on September 11, 2015—becoming the first in the field of major candidates to drop out—following poor polling after the first debate. In the weeks before he dropped out of the race, Perry&#x27;s campaign was in dire financial straits, spending nearly four times as much as it raised.

On January 25, 2016, Perry endorsed United States Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) for president. On May 5, 2016, following the suspension of Cruz&#x27;s presidential campaign, Perry endorsed Donald Trump for the presidency.

==Secretary of Energy==
On December 14, 2016, President-elect Trump nominated Perry as Secretary of Energy. The nomination initially faced heavy criticism as Perry had called for the Department of Energy to be abolished during his 2012 presidential campaign and had been unable to remember the name of the department during a Presidential debate. His nomination was approved by a 16–7 vote from the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on January 31, 2017.

On March 2, 2017, the United States Senate voted 62–37 to confirm Perry. The next month, Perry ordered a study of the U.S. electric grid with particular consideration to coal power.

In a CNBC interview on June 19, 2017, when asked about the role of human activity in the recent rise of the Earth&#x27;s temperature, Perry said, &quot;The fact is this shouldn&#x27;t be a debate about, &#x27;Is the climate changing, is man having an effect on it?&#x27; Yeah, we are. The question should be just how much, and what are the policy changes that we need to make to effect that?&quot;

In July 2017, Perry strongly expressed his support for Donald Trump&#x27;s ban on transgender people from serving in the U.S. military stating that &quot;The idea that the American people need to be paying for these types of operations to change your sex is not very wise from a standpoint of economics.&quot;

In November 2017, Perry suggested that using fossil fuels to light dangerous places in Africa could reduce sexual assault, saying, &quot;When the lights are on, when you have light that shines the righteousness, if you will, on those types of acts.&quot; Perry was criticized by the Sierra Club for &quot;exploiting the struggle of those most affected by climate change&quot;.

For one week in November 2018, it was reported that the U.S. had become a net exporter of oil, temporarily ending nearly 75 continuous years of dependence on foreign oil.

On October 4, 2019, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that he was expected to resign as Secretary of Energy by the end of 2019, based on information from anonymous sources. On October 17, 2019, Perry told Trump he would resign by the end of the year, ultimately departing at the beginning of December.

===Trump–Ukraine scandal===
A little more than a month after Perry attended Zelenskyy&#x27;s May 2019 inauguration, Ukraine awarded the contract to Perry&#x27;s supporters after Perry recommended one of them to be Zelenskyy&#x27;s energy adviser. The recommendation was made as Zelenskyy was attempting to secure the nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid. A week after Perry attended the inauguration, &quot;Ukrainian Energy&quot;, a new joint venture between Michael Bleyzer&#x27;s investment firm SigmaBleyzer and Alex Cranberg&#x27;s Aspect Energy, submitted a bid for a 50-year drilling contract at a Ukraine government-controlled site called Varvynska.

A July 25, 2019 telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy led in September to a whistleblower complaint and an impeachment inquiry against Trump. Two weeks after the inquiry was launched, Trump claimed in a conference call with Congressional Republican leaders that he had only made the telephone call at Perry&#x27;s urging. Perry&#x27;s spokesperson said that Perry had suggested Trump discuss energy security with Zelenskyy, but energy was not mentioned in the publicly released memo about the conversations, which instead focused on Trump asking Zelenskyy to launch investigations into Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, Crowdstrike, and the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Per Trump&#x27;s direction earlier that year, Perry spoke with Rudy Giuliani about Ukraine, which Mick Mulvaney confirmed. Perry denied ever mentioning the Bidens in his discussions with Trump or Ukrainian officials. Mulvaney had put Gordon Sondland, Kurt Volker, and Perry in charge of managing the Ukraine–United States relations instead of diplomats at the National Security Council and the US Department of State.

Perry was mentioned in October 2019 by former U.S. officials in relation to reports he planned to have Amos Hochstein replaced as a member of the board at Naftogaz with someone aligned with Republican interests. Perry denied the reports. In November 2019, both Sondland and David Holmes, who serves as counselor of political affairs at the U.S Embassy in Ukraine, testified that Perry had played a senior role in the Ukraine campaign, with Holmes even describing Perry, along with Sondland and Volker, was one of the &quot;Three Amigos&quot; who directly assisted both Trump and Giuliani.

==Career outside politics==
In February 2015, Perry announced that he would join the board of directors of Energy Transfer Partners, which owns and operates one of the largest energy asset portfolios in the United States, and Sunoco Partners, another major Dallas energy company. According to SEC filings, Perry resigned from the boards of both companies on December 31, 2016. In early January 2020, Perry joined the board of LE GP, general partner of Energy Transfer. In February 2020, Perry rejoined MCNA Dental&#x27;s board of directors as chief strategy officer and vice chairman.

===&quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;===
Perry was one of the celebrities competing on season 23 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; in 2016. He was partnered with professional dancer Emma Slater. Perry and Slater were eliminated on the third week of competition and finished in 12th place out of 13 competitors.

==Personal life==
In 1982, Perry married Mary Anita Thigpen, his childhood sweetheart whom he had known since elementary school. They have two adult children, Griffin and Sydney. Anita attended West Texas State University and earned a degree in nursing. She has spearheaded a number of health-related initiatives such as the Anita Thigpen Perry Endowment at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, which focuses on nutrition, cardiovascular disease, health education, and early childhood development. She helped develop and host the Texas Conference for Women.

Perry played himself in minor roles for several feature films, including &quot;Man of the House&quot;, &quot;Deep in the Heart&quot;, and &quot;Hating Breitbart&quot;.

Perry is a member of the National Society of the Sons of the American Revolution and was awarded its Gold Good Citizenship Medal.

<text>Fendi Srl () is an Italian luxury fashion house producing fur, ready-to-wear, leather goods, shoes, fragrances, eyewear, timepieces and accessories. Founded in Rome in 1925 by fashion designers Edoardo Fendi and Adele Casagrande, Fendi is known for its fur, fur accessories, and leather goods. Since 2001, Fendi has been part of the &quot;Fashion &amp; Leather Goods&quot; division of the French group LVMH. Its headquarters are in Rome, in the Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana.

==History==
===Early years===
The house of Fendi was launched in 1925 by Adele and Edoardo Fendi (1904–1954) as a fur and leather shop in Via del Plebiscito, Rome. In 1932 Adele and Edoardo Fendi opened a boutique in via Piave; the shop became a popular destination for tourists in Rome.

In 1946, the five sisters Paola, Anna, Franca, Carla, and Alda joined the company in its second generation as a family-owned enterprise, each owning 20 percent. Karl Lagerfeld joined Fendi in 1965 and became the creative director for the fur and women&#x27;s ready-to-wear collections (launched in 1977).

In 1966, Lagerfeld created the company logo, a double F in a square, which would later be the subject of various reinterpretations. Also in 1966, Fendi presented its first high fashion collection, expanding its interests in the United States and Japan. In 1969, its first commercial line of fur was launched, and in the following years, cosmetics and men&#x27;s accessories were released. In 1977, Fendi introduced clothing for the first time, its ready-to-wear collection.

===1980s–1990s===
In the 1980s, Fendi expanded its range with perfumes in 1985, as well as eyewear, jeans, and home furnishings in 1987.

In 1989, Fendi opened its first United States boutique in New York on 5th Avenue.

In 1994, Lagerfeld launched the Knicoat collection, a line of wool coats and sweaters designed to be worn together.

Also by 1994, fashion operations were responsible for 90 percent of the firm&#x27;s total revenue, of which 50 percent came from leather goods and accessories, 20 percent from apparel and 20 percent from furs. That year, Paola Fendi handed over the presidency of the company to her younger sister Carla. Silvia Venturini Fendi, daughter of Anna, also joined the fashion house in 1994 and has since been the artistic director for accessories and co-designer of the women&#x27;s line alongside Lagerfeld; in 1997 she designed the Baguette Bag, an iconic model that beat all sales and notoriety records.

=== Sale of controlling share ===
Fendi was a family-controlled company until 1999, when Prada and LVMH, the world&#x27;s biggest luxury goods group, joined to buy 51 percent of Fendi for $545 million; competitor Gucci lost out in the bidding process. Under the deal, Prada and LVMH were obligated to acquire any of the 49 percent of Fendi, should the sisters decide to sell. The label lost approximately 20 million euros in 2001 and again in 2002. In 2002, Prada agreed to sell its 25.5 percent stake to LVMH for $265 million. In 2002, LVMH acquired an additional 15.9 percent of the company. Carla Fendi, a member of the founding family, continued to act as chairwoman and a minority owner until 2008.

On 19 October 2007, Fendi chose the Great Wall of China to present its spring-summer collection and with 88 models, the first fashion show there.

In 2009, Silvia Venturini Fendi created the Peekaboo bag, achieving a success comparable to the Baguette Bag.

===2010s===

In 2015, Fendi celebrated fifty years of business with Karl Lagerfeld and organized its first haute couture fashion show dedicated to furs, &quot;Haute Fourrure&quot;, at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris. Later the brand celebrated its 90th anniversary with a fashion show at the Trevi fountain in Rome and planned to move its headquarters to Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana, paying 2.8 million euros per annum to occupy the space; Fendi instead opened a hotel and its largest store at the location in 2016. 
In 2017, Fendi collaborated with Rimowa on an aluminum multiwheel suitcase. Also in 2017, Fendi released a customization shop in collaboration with e-commerce platform Farfetch for made-to-order handbag designs.

By 2018, Fendi crossed the 1 billion euro ($1.2 billion) threshold in annual sales and had 3,000 employees worldwide, including around 400 in specialist leather and fur ateliers in Italy, and operated a network of 215 stores.

===2020s===
In September 2020, English designer Kim Jones was announced as artistic director of Fendi&#x27;s women&#x27;s collection, formerly occupied by Lagerfeld. Under his leadership, Fendi collaborated on a clothing collections with Kim Kardashian West&#x27;s shapewear brand Skims (2021), Versace (2022) and Stefano Pilati (2023).

In May 2024, Fendi announced its return to the perfume market with a first collection of seven scents directly inspired by its origins.

In October 2024, LVMH announced the departure of Kim Jones from Fendi. There was no announcement of a successor.

==Other activities==
===Diffusion lines===
In 1983, Fendi launched the Fendissime diffusion line of furs, ready-to-wear clothing and handbags, then designed by Silvia, Maria Teresa and Federica Fendi. From 1987 to 1992, Silvia Venturini Fendi served as the label&#x27;s designer. The Fendissime line closed in 2001.

Other diffusion lines have included Fendi 365, Fendi Country (later Fendi Jeans), and Fendi Maglia knitwear. Through licensing agreements, Gruppo Nadini manufactured and distributed several of these lines.

===Fendi Kids===
The Fendi Kids label made its debut in Spring/Summer 2011.

===Fragrances===
All previous Fendi fragrances were removed from the market after the end of the brand&#x27;s beauty license with Gucci Group&#x27;s YSL Beauté division in 2005.

In 2007, Fendi introduced its Fendi Palazzo women&#x27;s fragrance but stopped selling it in 2009 already. In 2010, the brand launched a new fragrance – Fan di Fendi –, the first Fendi scent to be unleashed under LVMH Fragrance Brands, before discontinuing its fragrances in 2015. In 2024, Fendi unveiled a high-end fragrance collection consisting of seven scents.

===Eyewear===
From 2013 until 2021, the company had a brand licensing agreement with Safilo for the design, production and worldwide distribution of Fendi sunglasses and optical frames.

In 2021, Fendi ended its partnership with Safilo and entered into an agreement with LVMH-owned Thelios to create, produce, and distribute its eyewear collection.

===Fendi Casa===
Fendi started its first line of home furnishings in 1987. Fendi Casa terminated its collaboration with licensee Luxury Living and instead partnered with Design Holding, jointly controlled by Investindustrial and The Carlyle Group, on creating Fashion Furniture Design (FF Design) to produce and distribute Fendi Casa.

===Real estate===
In 2016, Fendi collaborated with the interior designer Fanny Haim on the Fendi Château Residences, a 12-story beachfront condo in Surfside designed by the architecture firm Arquitectonica.

== Artistic directors ==
After 2019 Karl Lagerfeld&#x27;s direction (1965–2019), Silvia Venturini Fendi took over both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s collections.

From September 2020, the women&#x27;s collection was entrusted to Kim Jones, former stylist for the Dior men&#x27;s collection, who was appointed artistic director of &quot;couture&quot; and womenswear. Jones&#x27; debut collection was for Fall / Winter 2021/2022. During his tenure at Fendi, he frequently referenced Lagerfeld&#x27;s ready-to-wear. He left the company in 2024.

Silvia Venturini remains artistic director of accessories and menswear. In 2021 Delfina Delettrez Fendi, Silvia&#x27;s daughter, was appointed artistic director of jewelry.
== Cinema ==
Fendi has often collaborated with cinema; the maison has designed the clothes for &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot;, &quot;Evita&quot; and &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot;. Many famous film directors in the 1970s, including Luchino Visconti, Federico Fellini, Franco Zeffirelli, and Mauro Bolognini, chose Fendi furs for their characters.

Fendi has also dressed Sophia Loren, Diana Ross, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Soraya, and Liza Minnelli.

== Campaigns ==
Lagerfeld himself was responsible for the photography of most of Fendi&#x27;s ad campaigns before his death; since then, Fendi has worked with Philip-Lorca diCorcia (2001), Nick Knight, Craig McDean and Steven Meisel.

Past campaigns have featured Mark Ronson (2012), Catherine Zeta-Jones (2019), Zoey Deutch (2020), Linda Evangelista (2022), Naomi Campbell (2023) and Nicholas Galitzine (2023), among others.

== Philanthropy ==
=== Heritage restoration ===
In 2013, Fendi pledged more than 2 million euros to sponsor projects, including a clean-up of the Quattro Fontane and the restoration of the Trevi Fountain in Rome, and held the company&#x27;s 90th anniversary show over the fountain using a plexiglas floor.

In 2019, Fendi committed 2.5 million euros to restore the Temple of Venus and Roma, when it held its couture show at the site. By 2021, Fendi completed the temple&#x27;s restoration.

In December 2023, Fendi joined the restoration of heritage at Villa d&#x27;Este. In partnership with the Villas Adriana and d&#x27;Este, Fendi announced its new sponsorship project which consisted in the restoration of the grotto of Diana in the gardens of the Villa d&#x27;Este in Tivoli, near Rome.

=== Visual arts ===
In 2017, Fendi installed &quot;Foglie di Pietra [Leaves of Stone]&quot;, a sculpture by Giuseppe Penone, in Rome&#x27;s Largo Goldoni and donated to the city; Fendi committed to maintaining and preserving the monument for 30 years. Also in 2017, Fendi sponsored the Italian pavilion at the 57th Venice Biennale.

In 2018, Fendi signed a partnership with the Galleria Borghese to support the museum&#x27;s exhibitions for the following three years.

=== Other activities ===
In 2021, Fendi collaborated with a non-profit organization to create a &#x27;charity project&#x27; which consisted of designing a kids&#x27; unisex T-shirt whose money would be devoted to realize the wishes of kids who suffer from serious sicknesses.

In 2021 and 2022, Fendi collaborated with the Juilliard School on assigning the Fendi Vanguard Award – including a cash prize and a mentorship program – to four out of Juilliard&#x27;s final-year students enrolled in the bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and advanced diploma programs.

== Controversy ==
Fendi sued Burlington in 1986 for selling counterfeit handbags, and filed a new lawsuit in 2006 after concluding the company was violating the injunction. In 2010, a U.S. Magistrate recommended that Burlington pay Fendi just over $5.6 million in damages, attorney&#x27;s fees and costs to settle a dispute dating to 1986 over the alleged sale of counterfeit Fendi-branded leather goods. Burlington subsequently agreed to pay $10.05 million.

Also in 2010, Fendi reached a $2.5 million settlement with the former parent company of Filene&#x27;s Basement to resolve counterfeiting claims.

<text>Taiz () is a city in southwestern Yemen. It is located in the Yemeni highlands, near the port city of Mocha on the Red Sea, at an elevation of about above sea level. It is the capital of Taiz Governorate. As of 2023, the city has an estimated population of approximately 940,600 residents making it the third largest city in Yemen.

==History==
===Medieval===

The first reference to Taiz in historical sources dates back to the first half of the 12th century CE, when the sultan of the Sulayhid dynasty, Abdullah bin Muhammad al-Sulayhi, built the Al-Qahira Castle. Taiz first became an urbanized area during the days of his brother Ali bin Muhammad al-Sulayhi.

The next historical reference to Taiz mentioned that Queen Arwa al-Sulayhi&#x27;s minister, Prince Al-Mansur bin Al-Mufaddal bin Abi Al-Barakat, sold many of the country&#x27;s castles and cities - except for the fortresses of Taiz and Sabr - to the ruler of Aden Al-Zari&#x27;i, the preacher Muhammad Ibn Saba, in exchange for one hundred thousand dinars.

Turan-Shah, the older brother of Saladin, ruled the city after he conquered Yemen in 1173 CE. Turan-Shah built the citadel on the hill overlooking the old city. In 1175 CE, Taiz was made the capital of Yemen as it was incorporated into dominions of the Ayyubid dynasty by Turan-Shah.

Taiz&#x27;s expansion accelerated when the Rasulid dynasty, which ruled Yemen from 1229 to 1454, took over the city. The second Rasulid King, Almaddhafar (1288 CE), moved his kingdom&#x27;s capital from Sanaa to Taiz, due to its proximity to Aden. Taiz was said to have reached its golden age during the Rasulid dynasty, whose sultans spent lavishly on palaces, mosques, and madrassas. Its neighborhoods also teemed with schools, guesthouses, markets, orchards, and lush gardens, and the city was considered to be a center for the study of the Shafi&#x27;i school of Islamic jurisprudence.

In 1332 Ibn Battutah visited Taiz and described it as one of the largest and most beautiful cities of Yemen:

We went on ... to the town of Taʻizz, the capital of the king of Yemen, and one of the finest and largest towns in that country. Its people are overbearing, insolent, and rude, as is generally the case in towns where kings reside. Taʻizz is made up of three quarters; the first is the residence of the king and his court, the second, called ʽUdayna, is the military station, and the third, called al-Mahálib, is inhabited by the commonalty, and contains the principal market.
In 1500, the capital was moved to Sana&#x27;a by the ruler of the Taharid dynasty. In 1516 Taiz came under Ottoman control.

=== 1994 mass shooting ===
On March 25–26, 1994, a mass shooting took place in the city. A Yemeni killed eleven women and seven men, among them his wife and his mother, before he was arrested by police. When he was led away he managed to wrestle the gun from a police officer and kill another four people, three of them police officers, before he himself was shot dead. A total of 23 people were killed, including the suspect.

===20th century===
In 1918 the Ottomans lost Taiz to the newly independent Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen.

Taiz remained a walled city until 1948, when Imam Ahmed made it the second capital of Yemen, allowing for expansion beyond its fortified wall. In the 1960s, the first purified water system in Yemen was opened in Taiz. In 1962, state administrations moved back to Sana&#x27;a.

===Yemeni uprising and war===

During the Yemeni Revolution fighting in Taiz resulted in anti-government forces seizing control of the city from president Ali Abdullah Saleh.

As part of the 2015 Yemeni Civil War, on 22 March 2015, the Houthis and forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh took the city in the aftermath of their coup d&#x27;état in Sanaa. The city became the site of a military confrontation between Houthis and the forces loyal to Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi. The city was effectively under siege and the United Nations warned of an &quot;extreme and irreversible&quot; food shortage if fighting continued. In August 2015, Yemeni Member of Parliament Muhammad Muqbil Al-Himyari reported Houthi attacks on civilians in Taiz and appealed for help on Suhail TV (Yemen).

The 2015 confrontation expanded into a military campaign for control of this strategic city. Despite ceasefires and prisoner swaps, the battle continues to this day and the city has been described as a &quot;volatile front line.&quot; The frontline runs through the city from east to west, and journeys across the frontline that once took 5 minutes now take 5 hours. Once known as the &quot;cultural capital of Yemen&quot;, the war has bestowed a new name on Taiz: &quot;city of snipers&quot;.

As of 2018, at least seven journalists had been killed in Taiz since the start of the war.

The fighting has also devastated Taiz&#x27;s architectural heritage: Cairo Citadel was damaged by airstrikes in 2015, and the Taiz Museum was shelled in 2016, causing its manuscripts to be destroyed.

==Geography==

===Climate===
Taiz has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BSh&quot;), bordering both a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cwa&quot;) and a tropical savanna climate (&quot;Aw&quot;). The average daily temperature high during August is . Annual rainfall of Taiz is around , but on Jabal Sabir it is probably around per year.

==Landmarks==

The city has many old quarters, with houses that are typically built with brown bricks, and mosques that are usually whitewashed. The most famous mosques in the city are the Ashrafiya, the Mua&#x27;tabiya Mosque, and the Mudhaffar Mosque. Other landmarks include Cairo Citadel, which looms above the city from the south, and the governor&#x27;s palace, which rests on top of a mountain spur above the city centre. Taiz is also home to one of the best-known mountains in Yemen, Jabal Saber, almost above sea level), which affords panoramic views over the city.

==Economy==
Historically, the mountainous city of Taiz was known for coffee production. The Mocha coffee produced in Taiz was considered some of the finest in the region in the early 20th century. Today, coffee remains a major part of the economy but mango, pomegranate, citrus, banana, papai, vegetables, cereals, onions, and qat are also grown in the surrounding landscapes. Taiz is also known for its cheese. It is produced in rural areas like Araf, Awshaqh, Akhuz, Bargah, Barah, Jumah, Mukyas, Suayra, Kamb and Hajda and sold in Bab al-Kabeer and Bab Musa markets. Industries in the city of Taiz include cotton-weaving, tanning and jewelry production.

However, since the outbreak of the civil war in 2015, Taiz&#x27;s economy has been devastated by the fighting and the city&#x27;s siege by Houthi rebels. Many goods are in short supply, and must be smuggled in across steep mountain roads to avoid sniper fire.

==Transport==
Taiz has many road connections with the rest of the country. However, as of January 2023, most roads to and from Ta&#x27;iz are controlled by the Houthis, who are besieging the city as part of the Yemeni Civil War. The city is served by Ta&#x27;izz International Airport. With the closing of this airport due to the civil war, the only way into and out of the city is via cars or small buses that goes through a longer and less serviced roads than the normal roads before the war. However, There was an agreement recently towards open roads in Taiz that will save time and effort for people to go in and out the city.

==Zoo==
Like Sana&#x27;a Zoo, this zoo held fauna caught in the wild, such as the Arabian leopard, as well as exotic animals such as African lions and gazelles. Due to the civil war, however, many of the animals held at the zoo have become sick or died due to lack of food.

<text>Ruben John Efford (January 6, 1944 – January 2, 2022) was a Canadian politician. He first served as a member of the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly (MHA) from 1985 to 2001, representing Port de Grave electoral district and also serving as cabinet minister of various portfolios. After losing the 2001 leadership convention of the Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador, he went into federal politics and served as a Member of Parliament (MP) from 2002 until 2006 for the Liberal Party of Canada. He initially represented Bonavista—Trinity—Conception, before switching to Avalon after electoral redistribution prior to the 2004 federal election.

==Early life==
Ruben John Efford was born on January 6, 1944, in Port de Grave, Newfoundland and Labrador, the son of Reuben John and Diana Efford. He completed high school in his hometown, before doing a business administration program. He went on to become the owner and operator of Efford’s Wholesale, Snow&#x27;s Plumbing Ltd and the Della Lee retail clothing store. He joined and actively participated in the Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador during the early 1960s. He was elected to the District Liberal Association in 1969 and eventually became its vice-president.

==Provincial politics==
Efford entered provincial politics in 1985, running in the election that year for the provincial Liberals. He was elected to the House of Assembly, representing the riding of Port de Grave. He was initially Opposition critic for consumer affairs, public works, fisheries, health and social services. He later served as minister of social services, minister of works, services and transportation, and minister of fisheries and aquaculture after the Liberals won the 1989 provincial election.

A founding member and chairperson of the United Fisherpersons of Newfoundland and Labrador, Efford opposed the federal cod moratorium that impacted the province&#x27;s economy. He accompanied Newfoundlander fish harvesters to Nathan Phillips Square in Toronto to protest the measure and argued for their rights to fish. In his capacity as fisheries minister from 1996 to 2000, Efford was a strong proponent of seal hunting, which was given conditional support from the federal government&#x27;s fishery advisory committee – consisting of representatives from the industry and academia – as well as the House of Commons&#x27; fisheries committee. He was perturbed by some students and scientists at Memorial University of Newfoundland who wrote to the federal fisheries minister requesting that the latter delay increasing the seal quota until a complete scientific review was conducted. Efford was of the opinion that they were undermining his efforts.

Efford ultimately served as a MHA from 1985 to 2001. He lost the 2001 leadership convention to become Liberal party leader to Roger Grimes by 14 votes in a divisive contest. Despite Grimes offering him a senior cabinet position, both Efford and fellow leadership contestant Paul Dicks subsequently left provincial politics, maintaining that they could not work with Grimes.

==Federal politics==
Efford was elected to the House of Commons in a by-election in May 2002 and was re-elected in the 2004 general election. He was appointed Minister of Natural Resources in December 2003 and served in that role until February 2006. During his tenure, the federal government came to a new agreement on the Atlantic Accord with the provincial government of Newfoundland and Labrador. He also served as a member of the standing committees on Canadian Heritage, Fisheries and Oceans, on the standing committees of Human Resources Development, Status of Persons with Disabilities, Aboriginal Affairs, and Northern Development and Natural Resources.

==Retirement==
After considerable speculation that he intended to resign his federal cabinet position due to ill-health, Efford announced on September 1, 2005, to much surprise, that he had no intention to resign. He later stated on NTV that he would not run again in the 2006 federal election or run for the leadership of the Newfoundland Liberal Party. In November 2005, it was reported that Efford was retiring from politics due to poor health from diabetes.

In February 2011, Efford criticized the leadership of provincial Liberal Leader Yvonne Jones and called for her to consider resigning. Efford stated that her low poll numbers were the main reason for his request. He referenced a Telelink poll released that week by NTV, in which 11 percent of respondents said they would prefer Jones to lead the province. Jones responded by saying Efford was an absolute nuisance to the Newfoundland and Labrador Liberal party, and another poll done in March showed that Jones&#x27; popularity was now up to 18% from the 11% that the February poll showed.

==Personal life==
Efford was married to Madonna until his death. Together, they had three children: Jacqueline Ann, John III and Joseph Lee.

Efford revealed in 2019 that he had been battling Alzheimer&#x27;s disease for two years. He died on January 2, 2022, at a hospital in Carbonear, four days shy of his 78th birthday.

<doc id="545288" wikidata="Q1431214" url="?curid=545288" title="Spectral leakage">
<text>The Fourier transform of a function of time, s(t), is a complex-valued function of frequency, S(f), often referred to as a frequency spectrum. Any linear time-invariant operation on s(t) produces a new spectrum of the form H(f)•S(f), which changes the relative magnitudes and/or angles (phase) of the non-zero values of S(f). Any other type of operation creates new frequency components that may be referred to as spectral leakage in the broadest sense. Sampling, for instance, produces leakage, which we call &quot;aliases&quot; of the original spectral component. For Fourier transform purposes, sampling is modeled as a product between s(t) and a Dirac comb function. The spectrum of a product is the convolution between S(f) and another function, which inevitably creates the new frequency components. But the term &#x27;leakage&#x27; usually refers to the effect of &quot;windowing&quot;, which is the product of s(t) with a different kind of function, the window function. Window functions happen to have finite duration, but that is not necessary to create leakage. Multiplication by a time-variant function is sufficient.

== Spectral analysis ==

The Fourier transform of the function is zero, except at frequency ±&quot;ω&quot;. However, many other functions and waveforms do not have convenient closed-form transforms. Alternatively, one might be interested in their spectral content only during a certain time period. In either case, the Fourier transform (or a similar transform) can be applied on one or more finite intervals of the waveform. In general, the transform is applied to the product of the waveform and a window function. Any window (including rectangular) affects the spectral estimate computed by this method.

The effects are most easily characterized by their effect on a sinusoidal s(t) function, whose unwindowed Fourier transform is zero for all but one frequency. The customary frequency of choice is 0 Hz, because the windowed Fourier transform is simply the Fourier transform of the window function itself (see ):

:formula_1

When both sampling and windowing are applied to s(t), in either order, the leakage caused by windowing is a relatively localized spreading of frequency components, with often a blurring effect, whereas the aliasing caused by sampling is a periodic repetition of the entire blurred spectrum.

=== Choice of window function ===
Windowing of a simple waveform like causes its Fourier transform to develop non-zero values (commonly called spectral leakage) at frequencies other than &quot;ω&quot;. The leakage tends to be worst (highest) near &quot;ω&quot; and least at frequencies farthest from &quot;ω&quot;.

If the waveform under analysis comprises two sinusoids of different frequencies, leakage can interfere with our ability to distinguish them spectrally. Possible types of interference are often broken down into two opposing classes as follows: If the component frequencies are dissimilar and one component is weaker, then leakage from the stronger component can obscure the weaker one&#x27;s presence. But if the frequencies are too similar, leakage can render them &quot;unresolvable&quot; even when the sinusoids are of equal strength. Windows that are effective against the first type of interference, namely where components have dissimilar frequencies and amplitudes, are called &quot;high dynamic range&quot;. Conversely, windows that can distinguish components with similar frequencies and amplitudes are called &quot;high resolution&quot;.

The rectangular window is an example of a window that is &quot;high resolution&quot; but &quot;low dynamic range&quot;, meaning it is good for distinguishing components of similar amplitude even when the frequencies are also close, but poor at distinguishing components of different amplitude even when the frequencies are far away. High-resolution, low-dynamic-range windows such as the rectangular window also have the property of high sensitivity, which is the ability to reveal relatively weak sinusoids in the presence of additive random noise. That is because the noise produces a stronger response with high-dynamic-range windows than with high-resolution windows.

At the other extreme of the range of window types are windows with high dynamic range but low resolution and sensitivity. High-dynamic-range windows are most often justified in &quot;wideband applications&quot;, where the spectrum being analyzed is expected to contain many different components of various amplitudes.

In between the extremes are moderate windows, such as Hann and Hamming. They are commonly used in &quot;narrowband applications&quot;, such as the spectrum of a telephone channel.

In summary, spectral analysis involves a trade-off between resolving comparable strength components with similar frequencies (&quot;high resolution / sensitivity&quot;) and resolving disparate strength components with dissimilar frequencies (&quot;high dynamic range&quot;). That trade-off occurs when the window function is chosen.

==== Discrete-time signals ====
When the input waveform is time-sampled, instead of continuous, the analysis is usually done by applying a window function and then a discrete Fourier transform (DFT). But the DFT provides only a sparse sampling of the actual discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) spectrum. Figure 2, row 3 shows a DTFT for a rectangularly-windowed sinusoid. The actual frequency of the sinusoid is indicated as &quot;13&quot; on the horizontal axis. Everything else is leakage, exaggerated by the use of a logarithmic presentation. The unit of frequency is &quot;DFT bins&quot;; that is, the integer values on the frequency axis correspond to the frequencies sampled by the DFT. So the figure depicts a case where the actual frequency of the sinusoid coincides with a DFT sample, and the maximum value of the spectrum is accurately measured by that sample. In row 4, it misses the maximum value by bin, and the resultant measurement error is referred to as scalloping loss (inspired by the shape of the peak). For a known frequency, such as a musical note or a sinusoidal test signal, matching the frequency to a DFT bin can be prearranged by choices of a sampling rate and a window length that results in an integer number of cycles within the window.
==== Noise bandwidth ====

The concepts of resolution and dynamic range tend to be somewhat subjective, depending on what the user is actually trying to do. But they also tend to be highly correlated with the total leakage, which is quantifiable. It is usually expressed as an equivalent bandwidth, B. It can be thought of as redistributing the DTFT into a rectangular shape with height equal to the spectral maximum and width B. = \frac{1}{|H(f)|^2_{\max}} \int_0^{\infty} |H(f)|^2 df.&lt;/math&gt;
}} The more the leakage, the greater the bandwidth. It is sometimes called &quot;noise equivalent bandwidth&quot; or &quot;equivalent noise bandwidth&quot;, because it is proportional to the average power that will be registered by each DFT bin when the input signal contains a random noise component (or is just random noise). A graph of the power spectrum, averaged over time, typically reveals a flat &quot;noise floor&quot;, caused by this effect. The height of the noise floor is proportional to B. So two different window functions can produce different noise floors, as seen in figures 1 and 3.

==== Processing gain and losses ====
In signal processing, operations are chosen to improve some aspect of quality of a signal by exploiting the differences between the signal and the corrupting influences. When the signal is a sinusoid corrupted by additive random noise, spectral analysis distributes the signal and noise components differently, often making it easier to detect the signal&#x27;s presence or measure certain characteristics, such as amplitude and frequency. Effectively, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is improved by distributing the noise uniformly, while concentrating most of the sinusoid&#x27;s energy around one frequency. &quot;Processing gain&quot; is a term often used to describe an SNR improvement. The processing gain of spectral analysis depends on the window function, both its noise bandwidth (B) and its potential scalloping loss. These effects partially offset, because windows with the least scalloping naturally have the most leakage.

Figure 3 depicts the effects of three different window functions on the same data set, comprising two equal strength sinusoids in additive noise. The frequencies of the sinusoids are chosen such that one encounters no scalloping and the other encounters maximum scalloping. Both sinusoids suffer less SNR loss under the Hann window than under the Blackman-Harris window. In general (as mentioned earlier), this is a deterrent to using high-dynamic-range windows in low-dynamic-range applications.

===Symmetry===

The formulas provided at produce discrete sequences, as if a continuous window function has been &quot;sampled&quot;. (See an example at Kaiser window.) Window sequences for spectral analysis are either &quot;symmetric&quot; or 1-sample short of symmetric (called &quot;periodic&quot;, &quot;DFT-even&quot;, or &quot;DFT-symmetric&quot;). For instance, a true symmetric sequence, with its maximum at a single center-point, is generated by the MATLAB function codice_1. Deleting the last sample produces a sequence identical to codice_2. Similarly, the sequence codice_3 has two equal center-points.

Some functions have one or two zero-valued end-points, which are unnecessary in most applications. Deleting a zero-valued end-point has no effect on its DTFT (spectral leakage). But the function designed for  + 1 or  + 2 samples, in anticipation of deleting one or both end points, typically has a slightly narrower main lobe, slightly higher sidelobes, and a slightly smaller noise-bandwidth.

====DFT-symmetry====

The predecessor of the DFT is the finite Fourier transform, and window functions were &quot;always an odd number of points and exhibit even symmetry about the origin&quot;. In that case, the DTFT is entirely real-valued. When the same sequence is shifted into a &quot;DFT data window&quot;, formula_2 the DTFT becomes complex-valued except at frequencies spaced at regular intervals of formula_3 Thus, when sampled by an formula_4-length DFT, the samples (called DFT coefficients) are still real-valued. An approximation is to truncate the +1-length sequence (effectively formula_5), and compute an formula_4-length DFT. The DTFT (spectral leakage) is slightly affected, but the samples remain real-valued.
The terms &quot;DFT-even&quot; and &quot;periodic&quot; refer to the idea that if the truncated sequence were repeated periodically, it would be even-symmetric about formula_7 and its DTFT would be entirely real-valued. But the actual DTFT is generally complex-valued, except for the formula_4 DFT coefficients. Spectral plots like those at , are produced by sampling the DTFT at much smaller intervals than formula_9 and displaying only the magnitude component of the complex numbers.

=== Periodic summation ===

An exact method to sample the DTFT of an +1-length sequence at intervals of formula_9 is described at . Essentially, formula_11 is combined with formula_12 (by addition), and an formula_4-point DFT is done on the truncated sequence. Similarly, spectral analysis would be done by combining the formula_14 and formula_15 data samples before applying the truncated symmetric window. That is not a common practice, even though truncated windows are very popular.

=== Convolution ===

The appeal of DFT-symmetric windows is explained by the popularity of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm for implementation of the DFT, because truncation of an odd-length sequence results in an even-length sequence. Their real-valued DFT coefficients are also an advantage in certain esoteric applications where windowing is achieved by means of convolution between the DFT coefficients and an unwindowed DFT of the data. In those applications, DFT-symmetric windows (even or odd length) from the Cosine-sum family are preferred, because most of their DFT coefficients are zero-valued, making the convolution very efficient.

== Some window metrics ==

When selecting an appropriate window function for an application, this comparison graph may be useful. The frequency axis has units of FFT &quot;bins&quot; when the window of length &quot;N&quot; is applied to data and a transform of length &quot;N&quot; is computed. For instance, the value at frequency &quot;bin&quot; is the response that would be measured in bins &quot;k&quot; and &quot;k&quot; + 1 to a sinusoidal signal at frequency &quot;k&quot; + . It is relative to the maximum possible response, which occurs when the signal frequency is an integer number of bins. The value at frequency is referred to as the maximum &quot;scalloping loss&quot; of the window, which is one metric used to compare windows. The rectangular window is noticeably worse than the others in terms of that metric.

Other metrics that can be seen are the width of the main lobe and the peak level of the sidelobes, which respectively determine the ability to resolve comparable strength signals and disparate strength signals. The rectangular window (for instance) is the best choice for the former and the worst choice for the latter. What cannot be seen from the graphs is that the rectangular window has the best noise bandwidth, which makes it a good candidate for detecting low-level sinusoids in an otherwise white noise environment. Interpolation techniques, such as zero-padding and frequency-shifting, are available to mitigate its potential scalloping loss.

<doc id="545310" wikidata="Q2668847" url="?curid=545310" title="Crosshaven">
<text>Crosshaven () is a village in County Cork, Ireland. It is located in lower Cork Harbour at the mouth of the River Owenabue, across from Currabinny Wood. Originally a fishing village, from the 19th century, the economy of the area became more reliant on a growing tourism industry.

==Name==
The modern Irish name for Crosshaven village is &quot;Bun an Tábhairne&quot;. While some sources link the word &quot;tábhairne&quot; to the English word &quot;tavern&quot;, other sources suggest that it is a corruption of &quot;tSabhairne&quot; a grammatical form of the word &quot;Sabhrann&quot; the name of a local river. &quot;Bun&quot; refers to &quot;river mouth&quot; when in reference to placenames. Therefore, the name is potentially translated as &quot;mouth of the River Sabhrann&quot;. The old Irish name for the east side of the village was &quot;Cros tSeáin&quot; or &quot;John&#x27;s Cross&quot;, from which the English name derives.

==History==
Crosshaven was originally a Viking settlement, part of what was known as the &#x27;Ostman&#x27;s Tancred&#x27;, after Cork city became a fortified English stronghold.

According to local legend, Sir Francis Drake hid a small squadron from a larger Spanish fleet upstream from Crosshaven on the River Owenabue at Tubberavoid, now called Drake&#x27;s Pool. There is no evidence for this story, which is first recorded in 1750 by Charles Smith, who places it in 1589 after the Spanish Armada; Julian Corbett in 1890 said it could only have happened in during the 1573–75 campaign of the 1st Earl of Essex.

The local secondary school, Coláiste Mhuire, was founded by an aunt of James Joyce, and the town is mentioned twice in Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;.

Nearby coastal artillery and military forts, Fort Templebreedy and Camden Fort Meagher, were British outposts until the Treaty Ports installations were relinquished in 1938. Camden is located on the headland of Rams Head and is occasionally open to the public.

==Economy and tourism==

Originally a fishing village, in the late 19th and into the 20th century, tourism became important to the town, which has 5 beaches within a 2-mile radius. The area saw an increase in &#x27;holiday homes&#x27; in the mid-20th century, accommodating families from Cork city who stayed locally in the summer months - some of these temporary cabins were initially built using very large packing crates from the Ford factory in Cork.

Tourism attractions in the town included Piper&#x27;s funfair (known as &quot;the merries&quot;), a nightclub called The Majorca (now closed), a cinema (also since closed), and the Cockleshell (now an arcade called La Scala). Today Crosshaven is becoming a commuter town for Ringaskiddy and Cork city.

In the 1970s and 1980s, environmental concerns came to the fore as a large industrial estate was built across the river in Ringaskiddy. It has been host Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline and other pharmaceutical companies.

==Sport==

The village is home to Royal Cork Yacht Club (RCYC) which has had its headquarters in the village since 1966. The club was established at the Cove of Cork (now Cobh) in 1720 and holds the title of the oldest in the world, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. In 1966 the RCYC merged with the Royal Munster Yacht Club and made the Royal Munster&#x27;s club house its headquarters. The biennial Regatta of Cork Week (formerly Ford Cork Week due to the sponsorship of the Ford Motor Company) draws many competitors and upwards of 15 thousand spectators to each competition.

Crosshaven AFC is one of the oldest soccer clubs in Cork, and was founded in 1898. The club has two pitches, an all-weather training area and four-dressing-room clubhouse.

Crosshaven RFC (Rugby Union Football Club) was founded in 1972, and has two pitches, an all-weather pitch and a gym located at Myrtleville Cross in Crosshaven.

The local Gaelic Athletic Association club is Crosshaven GAA, which has teams playing both hurling and Gaelic football.

Crosshaven Triathlon Club meets for training on the walkway, with swimming at Myrtleville.

==Transport==
The town is situated on the R612 regional road, and served by a single bus from Cork city centre via Carrigaline. Cork Airport is the nearest airport, and there are also ferries to France from nearby Ringaskiddy.

Crosshaven railway station was the southern terminus of the Cork, Blackrock and Passage Railway (which originally opened in 1850, but only extended south of Passage West at the start of the 20th century). The station opened on 1 June 1904, and finally closed on 1 June 1932.

==People==

Notable residents have included the father of Bob Geldof, who was manager of the local Grand Hotel for a time, and Chelsea FC&#x27;s all-time 2nd greatest scorer, Bobby Tambling.

==Sister town==
Crosshaven has been twinned with Pleumeur-Bodou, France, since 1992.

<doc id="545321" wikidata="Q1230047" url="?curid=545321" title="Fornix (neuroanatomy)">
<text>The fornix (from ; : fornices) is a C-shaped bundle of nerve fibers in the brain that acts as the major output tract of the hippocampus. The fornix also carries some afferent fibers to the hippocampus from structures in the diencephalon and basal forebrain. The fornix is part of the limbic system. While its exact function and importance in the physiology of the brain are still not entirely clear, it has been demonstrated in humans that surgical transection—the cutting of the fornix along its body—can cause memory loss. There is some debate over what type of memory is affected by this damage, but it has been found to most closely correlate with recall memory rather than recognition memory. This means that damage to the fornix can cause difficulty in recalling long-term information such as details of past events, but it has little effect on the ability to recognize objects or familiar situations.

==Structure==

The fibers begin in the hippocampus on each side of the brain as fimbriae; the separate left and right sides are each called the crus of the fornix (plural &quot;crura&quot;). The bundles of fibers come together in the midline of the brain, forming the &quot;body&quot; of the fornix. The lower edge of the septum pellucidum (the membrane that separates the lateral ventricles) is attached to the upper face of the fornix body.

The body of the fornix travels anteriorly and divides again near the anterior commissure. The left and right parts separate, but there is also an anterior/posterior divergence. 
* The posterior fibers (called the &quot;postcommissural fornix&quot;) of each side continue through the hypothalamus to the mammillary bodies; then to the anterior nuclei of thalamus via the mammillothalamic tract. 
* The anterior fibers (&quot;precommissural fornix&quot;) end at the septal nuclei of the basal forebrain and nucleus accumbens of each half of the brain.

===Commissure===
The medial portions of the body of the fornix are joined by a thin triangular lamina, named the psalterium (lyra). This lamina contains some commissural fibers that connect the two hippocampi across the middle line and constitute the commissure of fornix (also called the hippocampal commissure).

The terminal lamina creates the commissure plate. This structure gives existence to the corpus callosum, the septum pellucidum, and the fornix. The fornix splits into two columns at the front (anterior pillars), and then splits into two posterior crura. These two crura are joined together through the hippocampal commissure. The beginning of the splitting is called the psalterium or &quot;Lyra Davidis&quot;. The latter name is used because the structure resembles a lyra (or triangular harp): The two crura are the &quot;chassis&quot; of the lyra, and the commissure connections are the fibers.

===Columns===
The columns (anterior pillars; fornicolumns) of the fornix arch downward in front of the interventricular foramina and behind the anterior commissure, and each descends through the grey matter in the lateral wall of the third ventricle to the base of the brain, where it ends in the mammillary bodies.

===Crus===
The crura (posterior pillars) of the fornix are prolonged backward from the body.

They are flattened bands, and, at their commencement, are intimately connected with the under surface of the corpus callosum.

Diverging from one another, each curves around the posterior end of the thalamus, and passes downward and forward into the temporal horn of lateral ventricle.

Here, it lies along the concavity of the hippocampus, on the surface of which some of its fibers are spread out to form the alveus, while the remainder is continued as a narrow white band, the fimbria of hippocampus, which is prolonged into the uncus of the parahippocampal gyrus.

== Functional consequences of fornix damage ==
The fornix is essential for acquiring and consolidating new episodic memories. Fornix transection studies in macaques have shown that the monkeys were strongly impaired on object-in-scene learning, which is a type of recall memory, specifically episodic-like memory (integrating what and where, although not when). Fornix transection in rodents impairs performance on tasks that require the encoding and retrieval of spatiotemporal context and, therefore, serves as a proxy for human episodic memory. For instance, fornix transection consistently leads to robust impairments in learning new routes and spatial locations.

Fornix damage in humans is rare; a few individuals have had their fornix transected inadvertently during removal of colloid cysts from their third ventricles. Nevertheless this small literature has consistently reported a persistent anterograde amnesia that is indistinguishable from the anterograde amnesia observed after focal hippocampal lesions. Deficits in recall are greater than for recognition, and the deficit is found across all types of material (e.g. visual and verbal). This supports the idea that damage to any part of the extended hippocampal memory system causes similar memory deficits. Other aspects of cognition, such as social cognition and language ability, remain intact after fornix damage.

Lesion findings have been extended by work using the non-invasive in vivo technique diffusion-weighted imaging. This literature has shown that fractional anisotropy (FA) in the fornix decreases with advanced age, correlates with age-related memory impairments, and is relatively decreased in mild cognitive impairment and in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. New research studies are using deep brain stimulation to stimulate the fornix as some evidence has shown that doing so improves episodic memory.

== Function ==
The fornix is the conduit by which the neurotransmitter acetylcholine – which is crucial for memory encoding – is sent from the medial septum/Diagonal band of Broca to the hippocampus. In addition, the GABA-producing neurons in the septal nuclei generate theta rhythms which are transmitted through the fornix to the hippocampus. In the absence of these external modulators, the hippocampus is radically dysfunctional. In addition, the fornix transmits mnemonic information from the hippocampus to deep brain structures, which potentially allows us to use stored memories to guide us to rewarding people, places, and sources of sustenance.

<doc id="545341" wikidata="Q3104325" url="?curid=545341" title="Gerry Byrne (politician)">
<text>Gerry Byrne, (born September 27, 1966) is a Canadian politician who was a Liberal Member of Parliament from 1996 to 2015 representing Humber—St. Barbe—Baie Verte, Newfoundland and Labrador, and a cabinet minister in the government of Jean Chrétien. Since the 2015 provincial election, he has served as MHA for Corner Brook. Byrne served in provincial cabinet during the Ball government and is currently Minister of Fisheries, Forestry, and Agriculture in the Furey government.

==Education==
Byrne received a Bachelor of Science in environmental science from Dalhousie University.

==Federal politics==
Byrne has been a Member of Parliament since 1996 when he won a by-election in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador to succeed Brian Tobin. Tobin resigned to run in the 1996 Newfoundland provincial election for Premier. He was re-elected in the 1997, 2000, 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2011 elections. In the 2006 election he had one of the highest margins of victory in Atlantic Canada. Byrne did not stand in the 2015 election and retired from parliament.

In 2005, Byrne voted against Bill C-38 allowing same-sex marriage.

In the Liberal Party&#x27;s 2006 leadership election, he started out supporting Maurizio Bevilacqua, after Bevilacqua drop out he supported Michael Ignatieff. Ignatieff placed second in the race to winner Stéphane Dion. Ignatieff became Leader of the Liberal Party two years later, and was again supported by Byrne.

In the Liberal Party&#x27;s 2013 leadership election, Byrne supported Montreal MP Justin Trudeau.

===Cabinet minister===
He was Minister of State for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency from 2002 to 2003. When Paul Martin became Prime Minister in 2003, Byrne was not assigned back to his former Cabinet post and was succeeded by Joe McGuire.

===Comments on PETA pie incident===
On January 25, 2010, Fisheries Minister, Gail Shea was pied while giving a speech at the Canada Centre for Inland Waters. An American PETA activist, Emily McCoy, was later arrested in Burlington, charged with assault in connection with the incident. PETA has taken public responsibility for the incident, saying that it was part of a broader campaign against the Canadian Government&#x27;s support of the seal hunt.

In response to the pieing of the Fisheries Minister, Byrne denounced the attack on the minister as an act of terrorism. He commented on the 26th, &quot;When someone actually coaches or conducts criminal behaviour to impose a political agenda on each and every other citizen of Canada, that does seem to me to meet the test of a terrorist organization.&quot; Byrne continued to say, &quot;I am calling on the Government of Canada to actually investigate whether or not this organization, PETA, is acting as a terrorist organization under the test that exists under Canadian law.&quot; In response to his interpretation of Canadian law, PETA president Ingrid Newkirk said Byrne&#x27;s reaction was &quot;a silly, chest-beating exercise.&quot;

==Provincial politics==
In the provincial Liberal Party&#x27;s 2013 leadership race, Byrne supported Humber Valley MHA Dwight Ball. Byrne retired from federal politics at the 2015 election in order to run successfully provincially later that year becoming MHA for Corner Brook. Following the Ball Liberals forming government in the 2015 election, he was appointed Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Labour. He subsequently served as Minister of Fisheries and Land Resources following a 2017 cabinet shuffle.
Byrne was re-elected in the 2019 provincial election.

On August 19, 2020, he was appointed Minister of Immigration, Skills and Labour in the Furey government.

Byrne was re-elected in the 2021 provincial election. On July 19, 2024, he was appointed as Minister of Fisheries, Forestry, and Agriculture and Minister Responsible for the Public Procurement Agency.

<doc id="545343" wikidata="Q235092" url="?curid=545343" title="Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland">
<text>Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland, Countess of Castlemaine ( ; – 9 October 1709), was an English royal mistress of the Villiers family and perhaps the most notorious of the many mistresses of King Charles II of England, by whom she had five children, all of them acknowledged and subsequently ennobled. Barbara was the subject of many portraits, in particular by court painter Sir Peter Lely. 

Barbara&#x27;s first cousin, Elizabeth Villiers (later 1st Countess of Orkney 1657–1733), was the presumed mistress of King William III.

==Early life==

Born into the Villiers family as Barbara Villiers, in the parish of St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster, Middlesex, she was the only child of the 2nd Viscount Grandison, a half-nephew of the 1st Duke of Buckingham, and of his wife Mary Bayning, co-heiress of the 1st Viscount Bayning. On 29 September 1643, her father died in the First English Civil War from a wound sustained on 26 July at the storming of Bristol, while leading a brigade of Cavaliers. He had spent his considerable fortune on horses and ammunition for a regiment he raised himself; his widow and daughter were left in straitened circumstances. Shortly after Lord Grandison&#x27;s death, Barbara&#x27;s mother next married Charles Villiers, 2nd Earl of Anglesey, a cousin of her late husband.

Upon the execution of King Charles I in 1649, the impoverished Villiers family secretly transferred its loyalty to his son, Charles, Prince of Wales. Every year on 29 May, the new King&#x27;s birthday, young Barbara, along with her family, descended to the cellar of their home in total darkness and clandestinely drank to his health. At that time, Charles was living in The Hague, supported at first by his brother-in-law, Prince William II of Orange, and later by his nephew, William III of Orange.

==Marriage==

Tall, voluptuous, with masses of brunette hair, slanting, heavy-lidded violet eyes, alabaster skin, and a sensuous, sulky mouth, Barbara Villiers was considered one of the most beautiful of the Royalist women, but her lack of fortune left her with reduced marriage prospects. Her first serious romance was with the 2nd Earl of Chesterfield, but he was searching for a rich wife; he wed Elizabeth Butler in 1660. On 14 April 1659 she married Roger Palmer (later 1st Earl of Castlemaine), a Roman Catholic, against his family&#x27;s wishes; his father predicted that she would make him one of the most miserable men in the world. The Palmers had joined the ambitious group of supplicants who sailed for Brussels at the end of 1659. In 1660, Barbara became the King&#x27;s mistress, and on 20 August 1660 was awarded two pennies seigniorage on every Troy pound of silver minted into coins. As a reward for her services, the King created her husband Baron Limerick the Earl of Castlemaine in 1661. These titles were given with the stipulation that they would only be passed down through Roger&#x27;s heirs by Barbara, and thus served as a way for the king to indirectly secure an inheritance for his illegitimate children. The two officially separated in 1662, after the birth of her first son. It has been claimed that Roger, Lord Castlemaine, did not father any of his wife&#x27;s children.

== Royal mistress ==

Lady Castlemaine&#x27;s influence over the King waxed and waned throughout her tenure as royal mistress. At her height, her influence was so great that she has been called &quot;The Uncrowned Queen&quot;, and she was known to assert her influence with the King over the actual Queen, Catherine of Braganza. This initially began upon the Queen&#x27;s landing at Portsmouth. Samuel Pepys reported that the customary bonfire outside Lady Castlemaine&#x27;s house was left conspicuously unlit for the Queen&#x27;s arrival. In point of fact, she planned to give birth to her and Charles&#x27; second child at Hampton Court Palace while the royal couple were honeymooning. 

Of her six children, five were acknowledged by Charles as his. Charles did not believe he sired the youngest, but he was coerced into legally owning paternity by Lady Castlemaine:

* Lady Anne Palmer, later FitzRoy (1661–1722), probably daughter of Charles II, although some believed she resembled the Earl of Chesterfield. She was claimed by Charles, Chesterfield and Palmer. She later became the Countess of Sussex.
* Charles Palmer, later FitzRoy (1662–1730), styled Lord Limerick and later Earl of Southampton, created Duke of Southampton (1675), later 2nd Duke of Cleveland (1709)
* Henry FitzRoy (1663–1690), created Earl of Euston (1672) and Duke of Grafton (1675)
* Charlotte FitzRoy (1664–1718), later Countess of Lichfield. She gave birth to at least 18 children.
* George FitzRoy (1665–1716), created Earl of Northumberland (1674) and Duke of Northumberland (1683)
* Barbara (Benedicta) FitzRoy (1672–1737) – Barbara Villiers claimed that she was Charles&#x27;s daughter, but she was probably the child of her mother&#x27;s second cousin and lover, John Churchill, later Duke of Marlborough

===Lady of the Bedchamber===

Upon her oldest son&#x27;s birth in 1662, Barbara was appointed Lady of the Bedchamber despite opposition from Queen Catherine and the 1st Earl of Clarendon, chief advisor to the King and a bitter enemy of Lady Castlemaine. Behind closed doors, Barbara and the Queen feuded constantly.

Her victory in being appointed Lady of the Bedchamber was followed by rumours of an estrangement between her and the King, the result of his infatuation with Frances Stuart. In December 1663, Lady Castlemaine announced her conversion from Anglicanism to Roman Catholicism. Historians disagree as to why she did so. Some believe it was an attempt to consolidate her position with the King, and some believe it was a way to strengthen her ties with her Catholic husband. The King treated the matter lightly, saying that he was interested in ladies&#x27; bodies but not their souls. The Court was equally flippant, the general view being that the Church of Rome had gained nothing by her conversion, and the Church of England had lost nothing.

In June 1670, Charles created her Baroness Nonsuch (as she was the owner of Nonsuch Palace). She was also briefly granted ownership of the Phoenix Park in Dublin as a present from the King. She was made Countess of Castlemaine and Duchess of Cleveland in her own right, but no one at court knew whether this was an indication that she was being jettisoned by Charles or a sign that she was even higher in his favours. The dukedom was made with a special remainder that allowed it to be passed to her eldest son, Charles FitzRoy, despite his illegitimacy.

King Charles II took lower-status lovers, in particular actress Nell Gwynne, who is commonly romanticised as an orange seller. So did Barbara, who built up a reputation for promiscuity; her daughter Barbara Fitzroy, born in 1672, is believed to have been fathered by her second cousin John Churchill, who built Blenheim Palace later in life.

==Character==

Lady Castlemaine was known for her dual nature. She was famously extravagant and promiscuous, with a renowned temper that often turned on the King when she was displeased. Diarist John Evelyn called her &quot;the curse of the nation&quot;. She influenced the King in her position as royal mistress and helped herself to money from the Privy Purse as well as taking bribes from the Spanish and the French, in addition to her sizable allowance from the King. 

She also participated in politics, combining with the future Cabal Ministry to bring about Lord Clarendon&#x27;s downfall. On his dismissal in August 1667, Lady Castlemaine publicly mocked him; Clarendon gently reminded her that if she lived, one day she too would be old. There are also accounts of exceptional kindness from Lady Castlemaine; once, after a scaffold had fallen onto a crowd of people at the theatre, she rushed to assist an injured child, the only court lady to do so. Others described her as great fun, keeping a good table and with a heart to match her famous temper.

==Downfall==

The King took other mistresses, most notably the actress Nell Gwynne. Later in their relationship, the Duchess of Cleveland took other lovers too, including the acrobat Jacob Hall, the 1st Baron Dover and her second cousin John Churchill. Her lovers benefited financially from the arrangement; Churchill purchased an annuity with £5,000 she gave him. The King, who was no longer troubled by the Duchess&#x27;s infidelity, was much amused when he heard about the annuity, saying that after all a young man must have something to live on. Her open promiscuity and extravagant spending made her a popular figure for satirists to use to indirectly ridicule the King and his court, which made her position as royal mistress all the more precarious. In 1670 Charles II gave her the famed Nonsuch Palace. As the result of the 1673 Test Act, which essentially banned Catholics from holding office, she lost her position as Lady of the Bedchamber, and the King cast her aside completely from her position as a mistress, taking Louise de Kérouaille as his newest &quot;favourite&quot; royal mistress. The King advised his former mistress to live quietly and cause no scandal, in which case he &quot;cared not whom she loved&quot;.

In 1676, the Duchess travelled to Paris with her four youngest children. She returned to England four years later. Her extravagant tastes never abated, and between 1682 and 1683 she had Nonsuch Palace pulled down and sold off the building materials to pay gambling debts. She eventually reconciled with the King, who was seen enjoying an evening in her company a week before he died in February 1685. After his death, the 45-year-old Duchess began an affair with Cardonell Goodman, an actor of terrible reputation, and in March 1686 gave birth to his child, a son.

=== Second marriage ===
In 1705, Lord Castlemaine died, and she married Major-General Robert Fielding, an unscrupulous fortune-hunter whom she prosecuted for bigamy after she discovered that he had married Mary Wadsworth, in the mistaken belief that she was an heiress, just a fortnight before he married Barbara. She had complained of his &quot;barbarous ill-treatment&quot; of her after she stopped his allowance, and was eventually forced to summon the magistrates for protection.

=== Death ===
Barbara died at age 68 on 9 October 1709 at her home, Walpole House on Chiswick Mall, after suffering from dropsy, now described as oedema of the legs, with congestive heart failure.

<text>Brian Patrick Herbert (born June 29, 1947) is an American author, known for his work on the &quot;Dune&quot; franchise, which was created by his father, Frank Herbert.

Brian Herbert&#x27;s novels include &quot;Sidney&#x27;s Comet&quot;, &quot;Prisoners of Arionn&quot;, &quot;Man of Two Worlds&quot; (written with his father), and &quot;Sudanna Sudanna&quot;. In 2003, Herbert wrote a biography of his father titled &quot;Dreamer of Dune: The Biography of Frank Herbert&quot;. The younger Herbert has edited the &quot;Songs of Muad&#x27;dib&quot; and the &quot;Notebooks of Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot;. Herbert created a concordance for the &quot;Dune&quot; universe based on his father&#x27;s notes, though, according to the younger Herbert, there are no immediate plans to publish it. He has written several comic books with Kevin J. Anderson based on &quot;Dune&quot; novels and short stories.

==Career==
Herbert is known for his collaborations with author Kevin J. Anderson, with whom he has written multiple prequels (and some sequels) to his father&#x27;s landmark 1965 science fiction novel, &quot;Dune&quot;, all of which have made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. The duo began with the prequel trilogies &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; (1999–2001) and &quot;Legends of Dune&quot; (2002–2004). Herbert and Anderson next published &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot; (2006) and &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot; (2007), two sequels to Frank Herbert&#x27;s original &quot;Dune&quot; series, which was left incomplete at the end of Frank&#x27;s sixth &quot;Dune&quot; novel, &quot;&quot;. These novels are based on an outline and notes left behind by Frank Herbert after his 1986 death for what he referred to as &quot;Dune 7&quot;, his own planned seventh novel in the series. In 2008, Herbert and Anderson began publishing &quot;Heroes of Dune&quot; (2008–2023), a series of four novels which take place between the first five novels of Frank Herbert&#x27;s six original &quot;Dune&quot; series, but only two were published initially. The others were set aside, first for the &quot;Great Schools of Dune&quot; trilogy (2012–2016), and later for the &quot;Caladan&quot; trilogy (2020–2022). However, in 2023, Herbert resumed the &quot;Heroes of Dune&quot; series by publishing &quot;Princess of Dune&quot; (2023). Herbert and Anderson have also written numerous &quot;Dune&quot; short stories (2001–2017).

<text>Lawrence David O&#x27;Brien (March 31, 1951 – December 16, 2004) was a Canadian politician. O’Brien represented Labrador in the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal from 1996 until his death in 2004.

Born in L&#x27;Anse-au-Loup, Newfoundland and Labrador, O’Brien was an adult education instructor, a public servant, a teacher, and from 1985 to 1996, and a town councillor in Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador. He served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans from 1999 to 2001. He was a strong supporter of a 2003 constitutional amendment which officially changed the name of the province of Newfoundland to &quot;Newfoundland and Labrador&quot;.

O&#x27;Brien was a candidate for the provincial Liberal nomination in the district of Cartwright-L&#x27;anse au Clair in 1996. After his loss in that race, he entered, and won, the federal Liberal nomination for the by-election in the riding of Labrador, vacated by the appointment of Bill Rompkey to the Senate. O&#x27;Brien was elected in the federal by-election on March 25, 1996, and re-elected in the general elections of 1997, 2000, and 2004.

He was diagnosed with cancer in 1998 and died on December 16, 2004, in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador. On January 31, 2005, the members of the House of Commons paid respects to him and his career.

<doc id="545364" wikidata="Q3274946" url="?curid=545364" title="Testimony (Volkov book)">
<text>Testimony () is a book that was published in October 1979 by the Russian musicologist Solomon Volkov. He claimed that it was the memoirs of the composer Dmitri Shostakovich. Since its publication, its portrayal of the composer and his views was controversial: the Shostakovich of the book was sometimes critical of fellow composers and most notably was strongly anti-Soviet in his views. The book also contained comments on his own music, suggesting that it was intended as veiled criticism of the Soviet authorities and support for the dissident movement. The authenticity of the book is still disputed.

==Volkov&#x27;s claim==

Volkov said that Shostakovich dictated the material in the book at a series of meetings with him between 1971 and 1974. Volkov took notes at each meeting, transcribed and edited the material, and presented it to the composer at their next meeting. Shostakovich then signed the first page of each chapter. It is difficult, without access to Volkov&#x27;s original notes (claimed to be lost), to ascertain where passages attributed to Shostakovich end and Volkov&#x27;s passages begin.

==Original manuscript==

The original typescript of &quot;Testimony&quot; has never been made available for scholarly investigation. After Harper and Row photocopied it, they returned it to Volkov, who kept it in a Swiss bank until it was &quot;sold to an anonymous private collector&quot; in the late 1990s. Harper and Row made several changes to the published version, and illicitly circulating typescripts reflect various intermediate stages of the editorial process.

Despite being tranlated into 30 different languages, the Russian original has never been published. Dmitry Feofanov stated at the local meeting of the American Musicological Society in 1997, how publishing contracts customarily vest copyright and publication rights in a publisher, and not an author. Assuming that Volkov signed a standard contract, he would have no say whatsoever in whether an edition in this or that language appears; such decisions would be made by his publisher.

That was why a group of anonymous Russian translators had translated the book from English into Russian and published it online in 2009. In their foreword they wrote:

&quot;The purpose of opening this resource is not to participate in the debate... Moreover, we never discussed this question and it is quite possible that different translators have different opinions.

&quot;This book itself is a fact of world culture and, above all, of course, Russian culture. But people of different countries have a possibility to read it in their own languages and to have their own opinion. And only in Russia it can do only those who not only know English language, but also has the ability to get the «Testimony»: this book is in the &quot;Lenin Library&quot;, probably exists in other major libraries. At the same time the number of interested in the question is incomparably greater than those who have access to these centers of culture...

&quot;We&#x27;ve seen our task in the opportunity to make up their minds about Volkov&#x27;s book to everyone who speak the same language with us, nothing more.&quot;

==Recycled material==

Laurel Fay first raised questions regarding the book in 1980, and reiterated in 2002. She found that passages at the beginning of eight of the chapters duplicate almost verbatim material from articles published as Shostakovich&#x27;s between 1932 and 1974. From the typescripts available to her, the only pages signed by Shostakovich consist entirely of this material verbatim and down to the punctuation. No other pages are signed and no other pages contain similarly recycled material. Quotations break off one word past each page break and then significantly change in tone and character (more readily apparent in the unpublished Russian). Critics of the book suggest Volkov persuaded Shostakovich to sign each page containing the composer&#x27;s own material, before attaching fabricated material of Volkov&#x27;s own. Irina Shostakovich has postulated on this scenario:

: &quot;Mr. Volkov brought Shostakovich a typed version of their conversations and asked him to sign every page at the bottom. It was a thin sheaf of papers, and Shostakovich, presuming he was going to see the proof sheets, did not read them. I came into Shostakovich&#x27;s study as he was standing at his desk signing those pages without reading them. Mr. Volkov took the pages and left.

: &quot;I asked Shostakovich why he had been signing every page, as it seemed unusual. He replied that Mr. Volkov had told him about some new censorship rules according to which his material would not be accepted by the publishers without a signature. I later learned that Mr. Volkov had already applied for an exit visa to leave the country and was planning to use that material as soon as he was abroad.&quot;

This claim could be investigated by studying the paper leaves of the original typescript, but Volkov has strictly prohibited such an investigation.

Supporters of the book&#x27;s authenticity offer two explanations for the recycled material. First, they assert Shostakovich&#x27;s profound musical memory allowed him to recite long passages verbatim. Secondly, they note that not all the pages which Shostakovich signed are of recycled material. In particular, he signed the first page of the book, which contains unrecycled and controversial material, as well the first page of the third chapter.

Fay addressed the two extra signatures in her 2002 book. According to her, Shostakovich did not sign the first page of the typescript. His signature is only found on the third page, which again consists entirely of recycled material. However, when Henry Orlov examined the original manuscript in August, 1979, he stated that all the signatures were in the first pages of the chapters:

Fay did not examine the original typescript but probably an edited copy distributed illicitly by the Finnish translator of &quot;Testimony&quot;, Seppo Heikinheimo.

Important also is the way Volkov claims to have assembled the manuscript. As he writes in the preface to &quot;Testimony,&quot; Volkov&#x27;s interviews with Shostakovich consisted of questions to which the composer provided &quot;brief&quot; and &quot;reluctant&quot; answers, and which Volkov compiled in a &quot;mound of shorthand notes.&quot; These fragmented notes were then &quot;divided up [and] combined as seemed appropriate.&quot; Thus, even if we accept that Shostakovich had a photographic memory, we are still left with the notion that Volkov transcribed the composer&#x27;s memories in personal shorthand, shuffled and re-shuffled these &quot;penciled scribbles&quot; (Volkov&#x27;s term), and managed to reproduce entire paragraphs of previously published material verbatim, right down to the original typography and layout. Such things as blacked-out passages, passages pasted over, and passages covered by correction tape in the circulated and photocopied typescripts could be reconstructed or investigated by an examination of the original typescript, which has been strictly prohibited by the author.

==Shostakovich and Volkov==

A second argument against the book concerns the claim that Volkov did not meet Shostakovich often enough to have received the material. Shostakovich&#x27;s widow, Irina, has stated that Volkov met him only three or four times. His poor health at the time meant that she rarely left him, so that she would have known about any other meetings. Irina Shostakovich commented in 2000 on the plausibility of Volkov&#x27;s statements about meetings between himself and Shostakovich:

: &quot;I read in a booklet that came with the phonograph record of the opera &quot;Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District&quot; conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich, which was released abroad, that Mr. Volkov was Shostakovich&#x27;s assistant with whom he had written his memoirs. Elsewhere I read that when Shostakovich was at home alone, he would phone Mr. Volkov and they would see each other in secret.

: &quot;Only someone with rich fantasy could invent something like that; it was not true, if only because at that time Shostakovich was very ill and was never left on his own. And we lived outside Moscow at the dacha. There was no opportunity for secret meetings.&quot;

However, some other witnesses support Volkov&#x27;s version. In particular, the composer&#x27;s friend Flora Litvinova recalls Shostakovich saying, in reference to an unnamed Leningrad musicologist (Volkov was from Leningrad): &quot;We now meet constantly, and I tell him everything I remember about my works and myself. He writes it down, and at a subsequent meeting I look it over.&quot;

Maxim Shostakovich has also commented on &quot;Testimony&quot; and Volkov more favourably since 1991, when the Soviet regime fell. To Allan B. Ho and Dmitry Feofanov, he confirmed that his father had told him about &quot;meeting a young man from Leningrad [Volkov] who knows his music extremely well&quot; and that &quot;Volkov did meet with Shostakovich to work on his reminiscences&quot;. Maxim emphasized repeatedly: &quot;I am a supporter both of &quot;Testimony&quot; and of Volkov.&quot;

==Reactions from Shostakovich&#x27;s family and friends==
Each side of the debate has amassed statements opposing or supporting the book&#x27;s authenticity. In 1979, a letter condemning the book was signed by six of the composer&#x27;s acquaintances: Veniamin Basner, Kara Karayev, Yury Levitin, Karen Khachaturian, Boris Tishchenko and Mieczysław Weinberg. Initially, the book was also criticised by the composer&#x27;s son, Maxim, but later he and his sister Galina have become supporters of Volkov. Shostakovich&#x27;s widow, Irina, continued to reject the book.

Supporters of the book discount the statements of those who were still in the Soviet Union as extorted or fabricated. They point to endorsements of the book by emigres and after the fall of the Soviet Union, including Maxim and Galina Shostakovich.

However, endorsing the factuality of the book does not necessarily mean endorsing it as what it claims to be, i.e., the authenticated memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich. For instance, Maxim Shostakovich has said that the book gives a true picture of the Soviet political situation and correctly represents his father&#x27;s political views, but continues to speak of the book as being &quot;about my father, not by him&quot;.

In 1980, after he had defected from the Soviet Union, he denied the book was his father&#x27;s memoirs.

Others who endorse the book are not necessarily even aware of the questions about Shostakovich&#x27;s signatures raised by Laurel Fay (&quot;vide supra&quot;, Recycled material) and therefore their competence in judging the book&#x27;s authenticity as Shostakovich&#x27;s memoirs (as opposed to its factual authenticity) is in question. Also, they include musicians whose personal acquaintance with Shostakovich was extremely limited (e.g., Vladimir Ashkenazy).

The claim that the condemnation of the book by the six Soviet composers was extorted or fabricated is also questionable. None of the five composers who were still living in the 1990s has disassociated himself from the condemnation after the fall of the Soviet Union. Kara Karayev died in 1982, but his son Faradzh Karayev has testified in 1999 that his father had read the German translation of &quot;Testimony&quot; and told his family, &quot;Mitya [Dmitri Shostakovich] couldn&#x27;t have written this, let alone allowed its publication. It is clearly a fabrication&quot;. (This claim is also supported by Kara Karayev&#x27;s diary entries from the same period.) In an article written in the same year, &quot;The Regime and Vulgarity&quot;, Elena Basner has told that her father Veniamin Basner, Mieczysław Weinberg (both of whom died in 1996), and Boris Tishchenko were also acquainted with (and indignant about) the book before signing the condemnation.

As a translator of &quot;Testimony&quot;, the Finnish musicologist Seppo Heikinheimo (1938–1997) had a copy of the Russian-language manuscript of &quot;Testimony&quot; in his possession and claims that he showed the text to dozens of Russian musicians, many of whom knew Shostakovich. According to Heikinheimo, Mstislav Rostropovich (in 1979) considered that &quot;Testimony&quot; is authentic, as did Rudolf Barshai, Kirill Kondrashin, Yuri Lyubimov, Gidon Kremer, Emil Gilels, and Sviatoslav Richter.

==Film==
&quot;Testimony: The Story of Shostakovich&quot; is a 1987 British drama film based on the book and directed by Tony Palmer and starring Ben Kingsley as Shostakovich.

<text>USS &quot;Vesole&quot; (DD-878) was a of the United States Navy.

== Namesake ==
Kay Kopl Vesole was born on 11 September 1913 in Przedbórz, Poland. Sometime thereafter, his family immigrated to the United States and settled in Iowa where he later attended the State University of Iowa. On 19 October 1942, he accepted an appointment as an Ensign in the United States Naval Reserve. He studied at a series of naval training schools during the remainder of 1942 and the first part of 1943. Beginning at the Naval Training School, Tucson, Arizona, he transferred to the Naval Training Station (Local Defense) at Boston, Massachusetts, in January 1943. The following month, he moved from Boston to Gulfport, Mississippi, to enter the Armed Guard School. In April, he moved to the Armed Guard Center located at New Orleans. Then he was routed to Panama City, Florida, to take command of the armed guard gun crew on board a merchant ship.

By December 1943, he commanded the armed guard crew assigned to the Liberty ship SS &quot;John Bascom&quot;. On the night of 2 December, the ship was anchored at Bari, Italy, when a massive air raid of 105 Luftwaffe Junkers Ju 88 bombers attacked the port. During that raid the ship was bombed. Before it sank, Vesole directed the defense of the ship despite severe multiple wounds. When it became apparent that the ship would sink, he led a party below and supervised the evacuation of the wounded. Once in the lifeboat, he manned an oar and helped to row the boat ashore even though he had only one functional arm. When he reached land, he disregarded his wounds in order to help pull survivors out of the oil-covered and flaming waters and to get them safely into a nearby bomb shelter. Finally, an ammunition explosion inflicted still further wounds on him, which proved fatal. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross.

== Construction and career ==
&quot;Vesole&quot; was laid down by the Consolidated Steel Corporation at Orange, Texas on 3 July 1944, launched on 29 December 1944 by Mrs. Kay K. Vesole and commissioned on 23 April 1945. She was ordered as a radar picket destroyer. Her mid-section torpedo tubes were removed to make room for a second radar mast and aft torpedo tubes were replaced with quad mounted 40 mm Bofors AA guns

&quot;Vesole&quot; alternated operations along the United States East Coast and in the Caribbean with the 2nd Fleet with deployments to the Mediterranean with the 6th Fleet, participated in blockade operations during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, underwent an extensive Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) overhaul at the Philadelphia Navy Yard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1964, and during the Vietnam War served as plane guard for aircraft carriers on Yankee Station in the Tonkin Gulf, participated in Operation Sea Dragon and Operation Market Time, patrolled on search and rescue duties, and carried out naval gunfire support missions.

&quot;Vesole&quot; deployed in northern European waters from January to June 1969 as a participant in Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT), a NATO multinational squadron under a Dutch Commodore and Canadian Chief of Staff. During this cruise, &quot;Vesole&quot; made port calls at Den Helder, the Netherlands; Portland, Plymouth, Portsmouth, and London, England; Trondheim, Norway; Lisbon, Portugal; Funchal on Portugal&#x27;s Madeira Island; Bermuda; and others. &quot;Vesole&quot; participated in Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s review of NATO ships in honor of NATO&#x27;s 20th Anniversary. The STANAVFORLANT squadron incorporated American, Norwegian, Dutch, and British ships, as well as West German, Portuguese, and Canadian ships for a period.

From April to September 1970, &quot;Vesole&quot; deployed from its homeport of Charleston, South Carolina, to the Persian Gulf, Red Sea and Indian Ocean as part of the three-ship Middle East Force (, a converted seaplane tender as flagship) and two destroyers deployed on six-month rotations. En route from Charleston, &quot;Vesole&quot; made port/refueling visits to Bridgetown, Barbados; Monrovia, Liberia; Luanda, Angola; and Lourenco Marques, Mozambique. While attached to MIDEASTFOR, the two destroyers operated as single ship units. &quot;Vesole&quot; visited Mombasa, Kenya; Diego Suarez, Madagascar; Djibouti, then a French overseas territory; Asmara, then-Ethiopia; Bahrain; Bandar Abbas, Iran; Dhahran, Saudi Arabia; Karachi, Pakistan; Cochin, India; Colombo, then-Ceylon; Malé, Republic of the Maldives; and Victoria, Seychelles. The ship embarked Robert Strausz-Hupé, the American Ambassador to Ceylon and accredited to the Maldives for that nation’s fifth anniversary of independence. The Ambassador presented that country’s president with a Moon rock from an Apollo program mission. &quot;Vesole&quot; returned to Charleston in October, with port/refueling visits in Lourenco Marques, Luanda, Dakar, Senegal; and St. John’s, Antigua.

&quot;Vesole&quot; was decommissioned at Charleston, South Carolina, and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 December 1976 and sunk as a target off Puerto Rico on 14 April 1983.

<text>USS &quot;Leary&quot; (DD/DDR-879) (radio call sign: &quot;Home Run&quot;), one of the longest-lasting s, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for Lieutenant Clarence F. Leary USNRF (1894–1918), who lost his life in the line of duty. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross.

==Construction and career==
===Commissioning and deployment===
&quot;Leary&quot;″s keel was laid down by the Consolidated Steel Corporation at Orange, Texas on 11 August 1944. The ship was launched on 20 January 1945 and was christened by Mrs. Theodore S. Wilkinson, wife of Vice Admiral Theodore S. Wilkinson. &quot;Leary&quot; was commissioned by the United States Navy on 7 May 1945. On 23 June 1945 &quot;Leary&quot; completed her shakedown off the US Naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and proceeded to her home port of Norfolk, Virginia.

In 1945 the Navy began converting 24 out of the 98 &quot;Gearing&quot;s to radar picket ships (designated DDR in 1949) that could provide early warning of massed attack without overwhelming their Combat Information Centers. &quot;Leary&quot; was overhauled to upgrade her to a radar picket destroyer, which included installing the most advanced radar systems at the time. She then departed for Boston, Massachusetts where some fire control work was done. This work was interrupted by V-J Day celebrations. Later, the ship steamed to Casco Bay, Maine where she operated with a task force to assigned to develop defenses against kamikaze attacks.

Upon completion, the destroyer returned to Boston Navy Yard again where the ship was painted to participate in a Presidential Review of the Fleet in New York City on Navy Day 1945. After the Presidential review, she returned to Norfolk and joined DESRON 1. While there, she picked up some army troops. The squadron proceeded through the Panama Canal and docked at San Diego, where the army troops disembarked. Soon after, she proceeded to Pearl Harbor, then on to Yokosuka.

===Occupation of Japan===
After Christmas at Yokosuka the squadron broke up into destroyer divisions for occupation duty. &quot;Leary&quot;″s division, Task Force 69 (TF 69), was composed of the &quot;Gearing&quot;-class destroyers , , and . The division reported off the coast of Kure. After a few months, the division went back up towards Yokosuka. During exercises the faceplate on the MT 51 caved in, requiring a stay in Yokosuka for repairs. The rest of the division departed for Guam, with &quot;Leary&quot; joining them later after repairs were complete.

Once in Guam, she joined the WESPAC Strike Force, Task Force 77, consisting of the aircraft carriers and , the heavy cruiser , the light cruisers and , and the rest of the destroyer division which included the and three other destroyers. The task force usually operated out of Saipan, and occasionally out of Apra Harbor, Guam.

During this time, her division escorted the carriers to Hong Kong. After the rest of the task force joined up, they steamed to Qingdao, China, with an overnight stay in Buckner Bay, Okinawa. During that stay the cruisers and destroyers carried liberty parties (sailors on leave) from the carriers to Shanghai. The voyage home began at Qingdao on 4 June 1946, with operations and stops en route. &quot;Leary&quot; moored at San Diego on 21 December 1946. She departed early January 1947 and later transited the Panama Canal to return to Norfolk and then Newport, Rhode Island before beginning East Coast operations.

&quot;Leary&quot;″s first Mediterranean deployment began in October 1945. Departing Newport on 29 October, &quot;Leary&quot; joined the U.S. 6th Fleet and made visits to ports in Algeria, Greece, Italy, and the island of Rhodes. She returned home on 14 February 1948. These missions were &quot;Leary&quot;″s routine in succeeding years. In 1949, &quot;Leary&quot;″s official designation was changed from DD-879 to DDR-879 to reflect her status as a radar picket destroyer. With the exception of 1957, &quot;Leary&quot; spent most of her time on active duty with the 6th Fleet, including the Suez Crisis of 1956, and the Lebanon landings of 1958.

===Cuban Missile Crisis===

On 22 October 1962, the crew of &quot;Leary&quot; listened to President John F. Kennedy declare a quarantine of the island of Cuba in what became known as the Cuban Missile Crisis. She was immediately paired with the US flagship for the quarantine, the heavy cruiser . &quot;Leary&quot;″s orders were to enforce the quarantine and assist &quot;Newport News&quot; in the missile count. From 22 October to 24 November 1962, &quot;Leary&quot; was continuously active in the US Navy blockade.

Tensions were running high when on 9 November, &quot;Leary&quot; and &quot;Newport News&quot; were operating in the waters northeast of Cuba. Suddenly, one of the first Soviet vessels, &quot;Labinsk&quot;, was detected by &quot;Leary&quot;″s advanced radar as it approached the Navy blockade. Three minutes later, &quot;Leary&quot;, along with &quot;Newport News&quot;, surprised the Soviet vessel and quickly intercepted it. While &quot;Leary&quot; trained her heavy guns on &quot;Labinsk&quot;, &quot;Newport News&quot; went alongside and ordered the Soviet vessel to halt. Two Soviet ICBM missiles, without any payloads, were discovered on the deck of &quot;Labinsk&quot;.

After the missiles were inspected and photographed, the Soviet ship was permitted to turn around and steam away due east from Cuba, with &quot;Leary&quot; trailing close behind. 21 minutes later when &quot;Labinsk&quot; was safely away from Cuba, &quot;Leary&quot; radioed a warning to &quot;Labinsk&quot; not to return to Cuban waters. &quot;Leary&quot; then discontinued the trail and returned to the waters around Cuba to resume her patrol line in the picket.

Individual details on &quot;Leary&quot;″s intercept from the US Navy, times are Romeo (UTC -5 hours):
* 090300R &quot;Leary&quot; and &quot;Newport News&quot; assigned to intercept the Soviet ship &quot;Labinsk&quot;
* 090615R Intercept made.
* 090730R Outer covers on missiles removed.
* 090748R Request to remove inner cover ignored.
* 090854R Deck cargo reported by &quot;Newport News&quot; as 2 missiles without nose cones. Outer cover removed for 1/3 of length from after end.
* 091100R 090836 posit 22-55N, 72-31W reported by CTG 136.2 Photos obtained
* 091113R &quot;Leary&quot; trailing.
* 091134R &quot;Leary&quot; discontinued trail. Labinsk proceeding

On 24 November President Kennedy declared the quarantine successful, and ordered the quarantine line disbanded after the Soviet MRBM&#x27;s were dismantled and removed from Cuba. &quot;Leary&quot; and &quot;Newport News&quot; arrived in Norfolk the day before Thanksgiving, having successfully completed their mission.

===Refit and Vietnam War===
The ship underwent an extensive Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization I (FRAM I) overhaul between April 1964 and January 1965. This removed her DDR radars, and &quot;Leary&quot; was redesignated as DD-879 again on 1 July 1964.

Between 24 April 1965, and 3 September 1965, she served on a peacekeeping mission off Santo Domingo as American troops were landed to prevent political chaos and subversion.

&quot;Leary&quot; saw active combat duty during the war in the Vietnam War. The standard rotation for destroyers was a few months combat tour of duty at sea, usually around five months. At the conclusion of her tour of duty, the destroyer would return to port for maintenance, usually her home port. While in port the crew would receive leave and go ashore. When maintenance was complete, the crew would return from leave and the ship would spend a period of time undergoing tests or exercises near port. When exercises were finished, the ship would receive their orders and then return to sea for a new tour of duty. This was &quot;Leary&quot;″s routine for her entire operational life.

She was among the destroyers that protected aircraft from the carriers on Yankee Station in the Tonkin Gulf. During periods of sustained air operations against North Vietnam &quot;Leary&quot;, along with the other destroyers on patrol, were responsible for providing protective cover for as many as three aircraft carriers at once. This included firing her guns and destroying missile placements in North Vietnam that were firing at the fleet. Her guns were often fired during naval gunfire support missions. &quot;Leary&quot; was also regularly called upon to provide emergency search and rescue duties, and was responsible for saving the lives of many who would otherwise have been lost at sea.

&quot;Leary&quot; was rotated out of combat in late 1965, and at the conclusion of her tour of duty, returned to her home port in Norfolk for routine maintenance. Afterwards, the destroyer participated in extensive antisubmarine warfare exercises off the coast of North Carolina and Puerto Rico. She then returned to Norfolk on 16 December 1965.

Following another month of operations, she once again readied for deployment. &quot;Leary&quot; departed Norfolk on 4 March 1966 for a five-month tour of duty in the Mediterranean on patrol with the 6th Fleet. Afterwards, &quot;Leary&quot; returned to Norfolk on 12 August 1966 for a month of leave and regular maintenance. The remainder of the year was spent conducting local exercises, including an extensive evaluation of her two advanced QH-50 DASH helicopter drones.

From 3 to 17 March 1967, &quot;Leary&quot; briefly served as a Sonar School Ship at Key West, Florida. On 5 July &quot;Leary&quot; once again passed through the Panama Canal and was quickly en route to an extended tour of duty off the coast of Vietnam. She was accompanied by the destroyers , , and . On arrival, she was immediately assigned to provide needed gunfire support off the Vietnamese coast as she alternated duty with the carriers on Yankee Station. Periodically, &quot;Leary&quot; reinforced the 7th Fleet cruisers and she provided naval gunfire support to allied forces in South Vietnam. On 9 October &quot;Leary&quot; operated on Baie de Ganh Rai of the Mekong River Delta in South Vietnam.

In 1967 &quot;Leary&quot; was active in Operation Sea Dragon and was responsible for using her guns to destroy land targets, as well as interdict sea lines of communication between North and South Vietnam. Steaming generally in pairs, the two to four American and Australian destroyers and one cruiser worked with carrier-based spotter planes, such as the Douglas A-1 Skyraider and Grumman S-2 Tracker, to find, identify, and destroy infiltrating vessels and shore targets. The destroyers took heavy fire from North Vietnamese coastal batteries, and &quot;Leary&quot; would immediately return fire. Although it was reported that life aboard Sea Dragon destroyers proved stressful and tiring, morale consistently remained high because of the operation&#x27;s effectiveness. While several ships were hit, no U.S. or Australian vessel was sunk during the two-year-long Sea Dragon operation and &quot;Leary&quot; remained undamaged. &quot;Leary&quot; remained active in Sea Dragon until the end of October 1968.

Then in January 1969 &quot;Leary&quot; again passed through the Panama Canal and was deployed for duty with the 7th Fleet providing gunfire support to U.S. operations in Vietnam until October 1969, after which she returned to her home port in Norfolk.

===Return home and longevity===
From January through October 1969 &quot;Leary&quot; made a Western Pacific cruise for extended deployment with the 7th Fleet providing gun fire support to US operations in Vietnam.

On 5 November, the Liberian tanker &quot;Keo&quot; broke in half about east of Cape May, New Jersey. First reports were that 36 crewmen were safe on the stern section of the ship. &quot;Leary&quot; was immediately dispatched to the scene, along with two United States Coast Guard cutters, two C-130 aircraft, the destroyer , and the cruiser . However, before any of the ships or the aircraft arrived, the stern quickly sank, and all 36 crewmen were lost.

From May through October 1970 &quot;Leary&quot; performed a Mediterranean cruise and from December 1971 to June 1972 the destroyer made another Mediterranean cruise which would be her final major cruise before conducting operations off the East Coast, which continued to her decommissioning on 31 October 1973. &quot;Leary&quot; returned one last time to Norfolk, and on 31 October 1973, stood-to for her decommissioning ceremony as she was recognized for her 28 years of distinguished and honorable service to the United States Navy. &quot;USS Leary DD/DDR-879&quot; was recognized as one of the longest serving Gearing-class destroyers in the Navy.

&quot;Leary&quot; was carefully examined for weapons effects testing, and provided vital information on structural integrity and survivability which assisted in the design and planning of later destroyers. After the tests were completed, she was transferred to the inactive fleet and stricken from the U.S. Naval Vessel Register on 2 June 1975.

===Transfer to Spain===
In 1978 Spain ratified a new constitution, and was now a newly free democratic state. The United States had pledged the new government their support. On 17 May 1978, &quot;Leary&quot; once again took to the sea and was loaned to Spain to aid in the transition of the new Spanish democracy. She was renamed &quot;Langara&quot; (D64) in the Spanish Navy.

She was part of Spain&#x27;s battle to suppress piracy and smuggling, which were very serious threats from opponents of the new free Spanish government. After Spain joined NATO, the destroyer found herself once again serving alongside other United States naval vessels. &quot;Langara&quot; spent the next fourteen years serving with NATO and insuring the survival of the new Spanish democracy until the effects of age overcame the ship. In 1992, she was stricken and broken up for scrap by Spain after a marathon 47 years of service on the Earth&#x27;s oceans, having protected two democracies and visited every sea at least once.

<text>Arcadia is a city in Trempealeau County, Wisconsin, United States, along the Trempealeau River. The population was 3,737 at the 2020 census. Arcadia is a Latino-majority city and the largest city in Trempealeau county.

==History==

Arcadia was founded in 1855 on a hill overlooking the Trempealeau River Valley. However, when the Green Bay and Western Railroad built a line in the river valley, the city developed along the line. In 1858, David Massuere began work on a flour mill that was then finished in 1860. In 1900, the city built a Grist Mill For Michael Stelmach and John Kamla. In 1903 Korpal Valley School was moved to the Mill. Around the early 2010s the school building collapsed and was removed, yet the Mill still stands.

Arcadia&#x27;s growth in the first decades of the 21st century has been fueled by the arrival of Hispanic and Latino immigrants. The immigrant population was targeted in a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid in 2018. As of 2021, the city was home to about twenty Latino-owned small businesses.

<text>Haematoxylum campechianum (blackwood, bloodwood tree, bluewood, campeachy tree, campeachy wood, campeche logwood, campeche wood, Jamaica wood, logwood or logwood tree) is a species of flowering tree in the legume family, Fabaceae, that is native to southern Mexico, and introduced to the Caribbean, northern Central America, and other localities around the world. 

The tree was of great economic importance from the 17th century to the 19th century, when it was commonly logged and exported to Europe for use in dyeing fabrics. The modern nation of Belize developed from 17th- and 18th-century logging camps established by the English. The tree&#x27;s scientific name means &quot;bloodwood&quot; (&quot;haima&quot; being Greek for blood and &quot;xylon&quot; for wood).

==Uses==

&quot;Haematoxylum campechianum&quot; was used for a long time as a natural source of dye. The woodchips are still used as an important source of haematoxylin, which is used in histology for staining.
The bark and leaves are also used in various medical applications. In its time, it was considered a versatile dye, and was widely used on textiles and also for paper.

The extract was once used as a pH indicator. Brownish when neutral, it becomes yellow reddish under acidic conditions and purple when alkaline. In a small demonstrative experiment, if two drops, one of concentrated ammonia and one of logwood extract, are placed close enough, the NH3 vapours will change the color of the extract to a purple shade.

==Logwood and pirates==
Logwood also played an important role in the lives of 17th-century buccaneers and into the Golden Age of Piracy. Spain claimed all of Central and South America as its sovereign territory through the 17th and 18th centuries; despite this, English, Dutch, and French sailors recognized the value of logwood and set up camps to cut and collect the trees for shipment back to Europe. Spain periodically sent privateers to capture the logwood cutters – for example, Juan Corso&#x27;s 1680 cruise – sometimes in retaliation for buccaneer raids on Spanish cities. Logwood cutters, now out of work, frequently joined onto pirate and buccaneer crews to raid the Spanish in return, as Edmund Cooke did after losing two logwood-hauling ships to the Spanish. When Spanish forces ejected a great many hunters and logwood cutters in 1715, they flocked to Nassau and swelled the already-considerable numbers of pirates gathering there. By the mid-1720s logwood cutters had themselves become targets of pirates such as Francis Spriggs, Edward Low, and George Lowther; pirate captains Samuel Bellamy and Blackbeard went further, turning captured logwood-hauling sloops into pirate vessels.
Logwood cutting was profitable – &quot;According to a government report, in the four years 1713 to 1716, some 4,965 tons of logwood were exported to England at not less than £60,000 per annum&quot; – but brought in only a fraction of the profits from tobacco and other legal exports, and &quot;was always a minor industry carried on by a few hundred ex-seamen and pirates in a remote corner of the globe&quot;.

<text>John Cadbury (12 August 1801 – 11 May 1889) was an English Quaker and businessperson, who founded the Cadbury chocolate company in Birmingham, England. He was also involved in activism and philanthropy, championing workers&#x27; rights, environmental and industrial reform, temperance, animal welfare, education, and healthcare, while actively opposing cruelty, exploitation, and indulgent practices.

==Biography==

=== Early life and education ===
John Cadbury was born on 12 August 1801 in Birmingham to Richard Tapper, a linen draper, and his wife Elizabeth Head Cadbury. He was from a wealthy Quaker family that moved to the area from the west of England. Cadbury attended Joseph Crosfield&#x27;s Quaker School at Hartshill, Warwickshire.

=== Quakerism ===
Cadbury was deeply involved in the Birmingham Friends Meeting, where he served as an elder for many years. At the age of 29, he was appointed clerk of the Warwickshire North Friends Monthly Meeting, and a year later, he took on the role of Overseer. He was the inaugural president of the Friends&#x27; Reading Society and actively supported the Seven Street Friday-day Schools. Cadbury also made multiple missionary trips to Ireland on behalf of the Quakers.

===Founding Cadbury===
As was customary for Quakers in the early 19th century, Cadbury did not enter a university or pursue a military career, turning his energies toward business instead. He was first apprenticed to a tea dealer in Leeds in 1818. In 1824, Cadbury opened a shop at 93 Bull Street, Birmingham, selling cocoa and drinking chocolate that he prepared himself, along with tea, coffee, hops, and mustard. He eventually decided to start commercial manufacture, opening a warehouse in Crooked Lane in 1831. In 1842, he was selling sixteen varieties of drinking chocolate and eleven varieties of cocoa. 

In 1846, Cadbury entered into a partnership with his brother Benjamin, establishing Cadbury Brothers. The company moved to a new factory in Bridge Street in 1847. In 1850, the Cadbury brothers pulled out of the retail business, which was passed to John&#x27;s son, Richard Cadbury (Barrow&#x27;s remained a leading Birmingham store until the 1960s). The partnership was dissolved by mutual consent in 1856 and John retired in 1861, following the death of his wife. Control of the manufacturing business passed to his sons Richard and George.

=== Activism and philanthropy ===
Between 1830 and 1841, Cadbury served as a Poor Law guardian, where he vocally opposed the exploitation of climbing boys and criticised the indulgent feasting practices of local poor law officials. A passionate advocate for environmental reform, he set an example by reducing pollution in his own factory and played a significant role in securing legislation to address industrial pollution. 

Cadbury opposed animal cruelty including bull-baiting and was a supporter of the Animals&#x27; Friend Society. He was also a supporter of the Peace Society and an advocate for Sunday schools.

Cadbury was an abstainer and active in the temperance movement. He saw drinking chocolate as an alternative for alcoholic beverages. At the time of his death, he had been a total abstainer for half a century and was one of the first to sign the pledge for the formation of a temperance society in Birmingham. He was a vice-president of the United Kingdom Alliance for many years and was an influential member of the Birmingham Temperance Society. He was also an active promoter of the Blue Ribbon campaign.

Later in life, Cadbury devoted himself to philanthropy, championing the development of hospitals, savings banks, and facilities for the blind.

=== Personal life and death ===
Cadbury married twice. He married Priscilla Ann Dymond (1799–1828), in 1826, but she died two years later. In Lancaster on 24 July 1832 he married his second wife, Candia Barrow (Lancaster, 1805–1855), daughter of George Barrow and wife Elizabeth Pumphrey, and had seven children: John (1834–1866), Richard (1835–1899), Maria (1838–1908), George (1839–1922), Joseph (1841–1841), Edward (1843–1866), and Henry (1845–1875).

Cadbury died at his home in Edgbaston, on 11 May 1889. He was buried at Witton Cemetery, Birmingham.

=== Legacy ===
During his lifetime, Cadbury dreamed of creating a model village. In 1879, Richard and George relocated the Cadbury factory from the centre of town to an area of what was then north Worcestershire, on the borders of the parishes of Northfield and King&#x27;s Norton centred on the 18th-century Bournbrook Hall, where they developed the model village of Bournville; now a major suburb of Birmingham.

In accordance with Cadbury&#x27;s teetotal heritage, Bourneville has been dry for over 100 years, with no alcohol being sold in pubs, bars or shops. Residents have fought to maintain this, winning a court battle in March 2007 with Britain&#x27;s biggest supermarket chain Tesco, to prevent it selling alcohol in its local outlet.

<doc id="545414" wikidata="Q1245157" url="?curid=545414" title="Battle of Loos">
<text>The Battle of Loos took place from 1915 in France on the Western Front, during the First World War. It was the biggest British attack of 1915, the first time that the British used poison gas and the first mass engagement of New Army units. The French and British tried to break through the German defences in Artois in the north and Champagne at the south end of the Noyon Salient and restore a war of movement.

Despite improved methods, more ammunition, better equipment and gas, the Franco-British attacks were contained by the Germans, except for local losses of ground. The British gas attack failed sufficiently to neutralise the defenders and the artillery bombardment was too short to destroy barbed wire and machine gun nests. German defensive fortifications and tactics could not be overcome by the British who were still assembling a mass army suitable for Western Front conditions.

==Background==
===Strategic developments===
The battle was the British part of the Third Battle of Artois, a Franco-British offensive (known to the Germans as the (Autumn Battle). Field Marshal Sir John French and Douglas Haig (GOC First Army), regarded the ground south of La Bassée Canal, which was overlooked by German-held slag heaps and colliery towers, as unsuitable for an attack, particularly given the discovery in July that the Germans were building a second defensive position behind the front position. At the Frévent Conference on 27 July, Field Marshal French failed to persuade Ferdinand Foch that an attack further north offered greater prospects for success. The debate continued into August, with Joffre siding with Foch and the British commanders being over-ruled by Herbert Kitchener, the British Secretary of State for War, on 21 August. On 3 May, the British had decided to use poison gas in military operations in France. At a conference on 6 September, Haig announced to his subordinates that extensive use of chlorine gas might facilitate an advance on a line towards Douai and Valenciennes, despite the terrain, as long as the French and British were able to keep the attack secret.

==Prelude==
===British offensive preparations===
The battle was the third time that specialist Royal Engineer tunnelling companies were used to dig under no-man&#x27;s-land, to plant mines under the parapets of the German front line trenches, ready to be detonated at zero hour.

===British plan===

French decided to keep a reserve consisting of the Cavalry Corps, the Indian Cavalry Corps and XI Corps (Lieutenant-General Richard Haking), which consisted of the Guards Division and the New Army 21st Division and 24th Division, recently arrived in France and a corps staff (some of whom had never worked together or served on a staff before). Archibald Murray, the Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff (DCIGS) advised French that as recently-trained troops, they were suited for the long marches of an exploitation rather than for trench warfare. French was doubtful that a breakthrough would be achieved. Haig and Foch, commander of the (Northern Army Group), wanted the reserves closer, to exploit a breakthrough on the first day. French agreed to move the reserves nearer to the front but still thought they should not be committed until the second day.

Haig was hampered by the shortage of artillery ammunition, which meant the preliminary bombardment, essential for success in trench warfare, was insufficient. With only 533 guns and a shortage of shells to cover front with two German trench lines to bombard, the British would probably be attacking positions that had not been disrupted enough to be broken through and reliant on the success of the gas attack. The British commanders did not grasp that German defensive tactics included placing the second line of machine gun nests on the reverse slopes of hills; destroying them would need howitzers and high explosive shells. Prior to the British attack, about of chlorine gas was released, with mixed results; in places the gas was blown back onto British trenches, while in others it caused the Germans considerable difficulty. Due to the inefficiency of contemporary gas masks, many soldiers removed them as they could not see through the fogged-up eyepieces or could barely breathe with them on, which led to some being affected by their gas. Wanting to be closer to the battle, French had moved to a forward command post at Lilliers, less than behind the First Army front. He left most of his staff behind at GHQ and had no direct telephone to the army HQ, which attacked at on 25 September, sending an officer by car to request the release of the reserves at 

==Battle==
===25 September===

In many places British artillery had failed to cut the German wire. The engineers manning the chlorine gas cylinders warned against their use, because of the weakness and unpredictability of the wind but they were overruled by General Sir Hubert Gough. In some places the gas drifted back into the British lines and caused more British than German casualties. Advancing over open fields, within range of German machine-guns and artillery, the British infantry suffered many casualties. The British were able to break through the weaker German defences and capture the village of Loos-en-Gohelle, mainly due to numerical superiority. Supply and communications problems, combined with the late arrival of reserves, meant that the breakthrough could not be exploited. Haig did not hear until that the divisions were moving up to the front. French visited Haig from and agreed that Haig could have the reserve but rather than using the telephone he drove to Haking&#x27;s headquarters and gave the order at Haig then heard from Haking at that the reserves were moving forward. French had not understood the state of the roads the reserves would have to use and had not constructed new ones. Most of the reserve divisions had to march through the day and night in single file up the only accessible roads.

===26–28 September===
When the battle resumed the following day, the Germans had recovered and improved their defensive positions. Much of the barbed wire, in some places deep, remained uncut and the British had used their stock of chlorine gas. British attempts to continue the advance with the reserves were repulsed. The British preparatory bombardment, which amounted to desultory fire for about twenty minutes, apparently inflicted no casualties. German machine gunners reported being &quot;nauseated&quot; from the sight of so many corpses and ceased firing so that the British could retreat with their wounded. French told Foch on 28 September, that a gap could be &quot;rushed&quot; just north of Hill 70, although Foch felt that this would be difficult to co-ordinate and Haig told him that the First Army was in no position for further attacks. A lull fell on 28 September, with the British back on their start lines, having suffered more than including three major-generals.

===Air operations===
The Royal Flying Corps (RFC) came under the command of Brigadier-General Hugh Trenchard. The wings under Colonels Edward Ashmore, John Salmond and Sefton Brancker participated. As the British were short of artillery ammunition, the RFC flew target identification sorties prior to the battle, to ensure that shells were not wasted. During the first few days of the attack, target-marking squadrons equipped with better wireless transmitters, helped to direct British artillery onto German targets. Later in the battle, pilots carried out a tactical bombing operation for the first time in history. Aircraft of the wings dropped many bombs on German troops, trains, rail lines and marshalling yards. As the land offensive stalled, British pilots and observers flew low over German positions, providing target information to the artillery.

==Aftermath==
===Analysis===

Rawlinson wrote to the King&#x27;s adviser Arthur Bigge (28 September)

Major-General Richard Hilton, at that time a Forward Observation Officer, said of the battle,


French had been criticised before the battle and lost his remaining support in the government and army due to the British failure and a belief that he handled poorly the reserve divisions. French was replaced by Haig as Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on 15 December 1915. Though Haig and Gough committed too many of their forces on the first day, they largely escaped blame for the debacle. French&#x27;s combination of poor tactical planning, lack of knowledge of the conditions and poor execution in releasing the reserves was blamed for the British failure by John Keegan in 1998.

===Casualties===
British casualties suffered in the main attack were they suffered in the subsidiary attack, a total of of the casualties on the Western Front in 1915. James Edmonds, the British official historian, gave German losses in the period as of on the Western Front during the autumn offensives in Artois and Champagne. In , the German official account, 6th Army casualties are given as 21 September; by the end of October losses had risen to total German casualties for the autumn battle () in Artois and Champagne, were given as About 26,000 of the German casualties were attributable to the Battle of Loos.

Fifty-four Commonwealth commanding officers were killed or wounded in the battle.

===Subsequent operations===
====3–13 October====
The Germans made several attempts to recapture the Hohenzollern Redoubt, which they accomplished on 3 October. On 8 October, the Germans attempted to recapture much of the remaining lost ground by attacking with five regiments around Loos and against part of the 7th Division on the left flank. Foggy weather inhibited observation, the artillery preparation was inadequate and the British and French defenders were well prepared behind intact wire. The German attack was repulsed with but managed to disrupt British attack preparations, causing a delay until the night of The British made a final attack on 13 October, which failed due to a lack of hand grenades. Haig thought it might be possible to launch another attack on 7 November but the combination of heavy rain and accurate German shelling during the second half of October persuaded him to abandon the attempt.

==Commemoration==

The Loos Memorial commemorates over of Britain and the Commonwealth who fell in the battle and have no known grave. The community of Loos in British Columbia, changed its name from Crescent Island to commemorate the battle and several participants wrote of their experiences, Robert Graves described the battle and succeeding days in his war memoir &quot;Good-Bye to All That&quot; (1929), Patrick MacGill, who served as a stretcher-bearer in the London Irish and was wounded at Loos in October 1915, described the battle in his autobiographical novel &quot;The Great Push&quot; (1916) and J. N. Hall related his experiences in the British Army at Loos in &quot;Kitchener&#x27;s Mob&quot; (1916).

<text>Kouros (, , plural kouroi) is the modern term given to free-standing Ancient Greek sculptures that depict nude male youths. They first appear in the Archaic period in Greece and are prominent in Attica and Boeotia, with a less frequent presence in many other Ancient Greek territories such as Sicily.
Such statues are found across the Greek-speaking world; the preponderance of these were found in sanctuaries of Apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of Apollo Ptoion, Boeotia, alone.
These free-standing sculptures were typically marble, but the form is also rendered in limestone, wood, bronze, ivory and terracotta. They are typically life-sized, though early colossal examples are up to 3 meters tall.

The female sculptural counterpart of the kouros is the kore.

==Etymology==
The Ancient Greek word kouros () refers to &quot;youth, boy, especially of noble rank.&quot;
When a pubescent was received into the body of grown men, as a grown &quot;Kouros&quot;, he could enter the initiation fest of the brotherhood (phratry, ). &quot;Apellaios&quot; was the month of these rites, and Apollo (&quot;Apellon&quot;) was the &quot;megistos kouros&quot; (the greatest Kouros). 

The word is also attested in Linear B, a syllabary system of writing used to record the Mycenaean Greek dialect of the Hellenic languages. The word &quot;ko-wo&quot; (, *&quot;kórwos&quot;) is attested in tablets from Pylos and Knossos, and could mean &quot;the sons of the women recorded in those tablets&quot;.

The term kouros was first proposed for what were previously thought to be depictions of Apollo by V.I. Leonardos in 1895 in relation to the youth from Keratea, and adopted by Henri Lechat as a generic term for the standing male figure in 1904.

==Purpose==
The kouros type appears to have served several functions. It was previously thought that it was used only to represent the god Apollo, as attested by its depiction on a vase painting in the presence of supplicants. This association with Apollo was supported by the description of the statue of the Pythian Apollo at Samos by Diodoros as &quot;Egyptian in style, with his arms hanging by his sides and his legs parted&quot;. However, not all kouroi are images of a deity; many have been discovered in cemeteries where they likely served as commemorative tombstones of the deceased. This type was also used as a memorial for victors in the games (like trophies), kouroi were used as offerings to the gods, (Pausanias describes the statue of Arrhichion, an Olympic pankratiast, as in the kouros scheme), and some kouroi have been found in sanctuaries other than that of Apollo. Indeed, some kouroi placed in sanctuaries were not inscribed with the name of the god but with a mortal, for example the &#x27;Delphi Twins&#x27; Kleobis and Biton were honoured for their piety with matching kouroi.

A direct influence between Egyptian sculptures (in particular the figure of Horus) and the kouros type has long been conjectured, not least because of trade and cultural relations that are known to have existed since the mid-seventh century BCE. A 1978 study by Eleanor Guralnick applied stereophotogrammetric measurement and cluster analysis to a number of Greek and Egyptian statues and found the correlation between the Second Canon of the 26th Dynasty and Greek kouroi to be widely distributed but not universal.

==Origin and evolution==
The problem of the evolution of the kouros type is inevitably linked to that of the overall development of monumental Archaic Greek sculpture. There are fundamentally two schools of thought on how those Daedalic forms, some of which we know of only from the literature (kolossos, bretas, andrias and xoanon), became the free-standing sculpture in around the 6th century; namely, that it was a response to the internal development of Greek types and religious needs or a product of foreign influence. For an external cause for change, possible sources of influence have been cited, such as Egypt, Anatolia and Syria, with the strongest case made for Egypt. It is known that the Greeks had longstanding trade relations with Egypt prior to the founding of the Greek entrepôt of Naukratis in the mid-7th century,
where the Greeks could have learned Egyptian sculpting methods.
The work of Guralnick along with the previous studies by Erik Iversen and Kim Levin have added considerably to the argument for an imitation by Greek sculptors of Egyptian sculpture. The system of proportion in the second Egyptian canon of the Saite period consisted of a grid of twenty-one and one-fourth parts, with twenty-one squares from the soles of the feet to a line drawn through the centre of the eyes. The grid was applied to the surface of the block being carved, allowing the major anatomical features to be located at fixed grid points. Iversen has shown that the New York kouros conforms to this ratio of proportion. It was Guralnick, however, who developed this discovery by comparing other kouroi by means of cluster and Z-score profile analysis to the Egyptian Canon II and a control group composed of statistically average Mediterranean men. As a result, she has identified two strains within methods of proportioning in sixth century kouroi, where the majority follow the general line of evolution from the foreign model towards an idealized human norm.

According to Hurwit &amp; Campbell: &quot;Kouroi apparently first appeared on the island of Naxos, since most early examples are in Naxian marble&quot;.

==Attributes and meaning==
Kouroi are beardless, take a formulaic advancing posture, and are most often nude.
Taking from the style of Egyptian figures, Greek kouroi often have their left leg extended forward as though walking; however, the figurine looks as though it could be either standing still or taking a long stride. A small number of early kouroi are belted around their waists, a practice that died out at the turn of the sixth century. Such belts have traditionally been assumed to be an abbreviated symbol of a more complex costume, however fully clothed contemporary figures also exist, suggesting that it was not just a sculptor&#x27;s shorthand for clothing but a signifier in itself. Art historian B.S. Ridgway suggests that this may have been an attribute of Apollo, athleticism or magical powers, though its iconography remains obscure. Further, there is the question of the nudity of the kouros and if this is also an attribute. Again this may have represented athletic or heroic nudity – immortalising the youth as he appeared in the palaestra, but no examples have been found at Olympia nor do they bear any allusion to athletic equipment.

As well as being found in the sanctuaries of Apollo at Delphi, Delos and Mt. Ptoion, kouroi have been found dedicated at the sanctuaries of Hera at Samos, and of Athena and Poseidon at Sounion,
so the contention that they depict Apollo is at the very least problematic. However, the majority are from Apollonian sites and dedicated to that god, which has led Ridgway (1993) to suggest that the early, belted form of the kouros-type statue was introduced in the late seventh century as a replacement for the colossal representation of Apollo.
Over time, the votive and funerary functions of the sculpture became divorced whilst its attributes were shed and its form became more generic until, in the late sixth century, it could serve a number of uses depending on context and location. This &#x27;polyvalent&#x27; argument, initially put forth by historian Jean Ducat,
was elaborated by art historian Andrew Stewart, who contends the distribution of kouroi coincides with city-states where the aristocracy were in ascendancy and that this alternation between the divine and the memorial was an identification of aristocratic &quot;arete&quot; with the immortal.

==Development==
The earliest extant examples may be the two life-sized marble figures from the Ionic sanctuary on the island of Delos dating from the second or third quarter of the seventh century. The canonical form of the kouros persists until the beginning of the classical period, by which time artists had achieved a high degree of anatomical verisimilitude, if not naturalism, as can be observed on such transitional works as the Kritios Boy, The absolute chronology of the kouros form is uncertain; none of the sculptures have secure dates.

There is a strong homogeneity across the various regional schools: where anatomical innovations were adopted they seem to have spread quickly amongst the different workshops so that &quot;regional distinctions become merged in a common progression&quot;. Consequently, the development of the kouros type as we now understand it is based on the relative chronology delineated by Richter, who distinguishes six groups by their common anatomical features, with particular reference to the major muscle groups as illustrated in the écorchés.
===Sounion group===
 615–590 BCE: the dates of this period are tentative, roughly late seventh-early sixth century, which Richter infers from the duration of development necessary for the previous generations from the more securely dated Tenea-Volomandra group. Additionally she notes a similarity of sculpture from this time to early Athenian pottery, particularly the Nessos amphora
and the human figures on the Horse amphorae.
Richter also detects a resemblance between the New York-Sounion kouroi and an early Corinthian pyxis
of the last quarter of the seventh century. Notable works of the time include the New York kouros,
Dermys and Kittylos,
Delphi Twins,
the Sounion kouros, and the Delos colossus.

The conception of form in this period is abstract and geometrical, emphasis is on architectural shape and the interrelation of parts which favoured expressive pattern over realism. Figures display the four faces of the block from which they are carved, their form is cubic with details incised, and their anatomy is only partially understood. Harmony and expressive pattern are the goal, and as such the proportions are abnormal. The torso is four-sided and flat, the back is higher than chest with the vertebral column expressed as a straight line. The skull is undeveloped; flat at the back and often on top. The ear is carved in one plane, and highly stylized. Tragus is knob like, either on cheek or lobe. Antitragus is not indicated. The eyes are large and flat, canthus is not marked, lachrymal caruncle is not indicated. The mouth is horizontal, with lips on same plane, and corners of mouth forming triangular depressions. Hair is arranged in parallel beaded tresses, which rarely radiates from the vertex. The Sterno-mastoids, when marked, are indicated by grooves running to the sternal notch. There is no indication of swelling of trapezius on the outline of shoulders. The clavicles are flat ridges along whole course of shoulders. Median line is sometimes marked by a groove from sternal notch to navel. The lower boundary of the thorax has the shape of a pointed arch. Rectus abdominis is formed by three or more transverse divisions above navel. The navel is generally a knob in a circular groove. Serratus magnus is not indicated. The shoulder blades are outlined by grooves on the surface of back. The erector spinae attachment to posterior part of the iliac crest is sometimes indicated by grooves in the lumbar regions. Forearm is supinated, with palm towards the body. Arms often separated from body between armpit and hand. Thumbs are large. Vastus internus descends to about the same level as vastus externus, the shin is vertical, and the malleoli are level. Weight is evenly distributed on both legs and the flanks are level.

===Orchomenos–Thera group===
 590–570 BCE: this period witnesses a lull in Attica with perhaps only two identifiable works from the beginning of the era until the second quarter of century, this might be due to the Solonic reforms and their restriction on the extravagance of private funerals. Activity is more vigorous in Boeotia, especially those from the Ptoan sanctuary and the Orchomenos kouros, early work there is probably native. Also Corinth, Actium produces one of the best examples of the period, detailing still of in the form of grooves and ridges but there is the beginning of modeling in the full roundness of natural form. One of the more accomplished products of the time is the Thera kouros,
softer and less muscular in modeling it is more Ionian than Dorian though Thera was a Dorian colony. We may deduce the chronology of this period only if the dates for the Sounion and Volodmera groups are correct since there is no external evidence for the dates of this style; however, we can usefully compare the heads on vase painting of middle Corinthian 600-575 BCE which share the same stolid expression, flat skull, large eyes and horizontal mouth.

The characteristics of this style are as follows. The ear is still carved in one plane, but less stylised. Eyes are not so large as before and more rounded. Mouth is horizontal but no longer always in one plane. The slight protrusions of flanks are sometimes prolonged into a girdle-like ridge, the sculptor occasionally marks the anterior spine of the crest. Shoulder blades are now separate raised planes. The erector spinae sometimes indicated as raised planes. Arms are generally joined to body. The depression over great trochanter is generally omitted. Shin sometimes curves inwards. Left flank is occasionally placed slightly forward.

===Tenea–Volomandra group===
 575–550 BCE: named after an Attic kouros found at Volomandra and a Corinthian specimen from Tenea (Munich 168) this period marks the flowering of the Middle Archaic, and these kouroi are contemporary with such works as the Berlin Standing Kore, the Moschophoros and the Bluebeard Pediment. There is a tension observable in this group between the solid, architectonic quality of early styles and the expressive possibilities of a vigorous, fluid naturalism . The anatomical novelties of this time are as follows. The ear is carved in more than one plane. A roundness of the eye is indicated henceforth. Lips curve upwards and meet more or less at corners, the upper lip protrudes over lower. Construction of neck is generalized, sterno-mastoids when indicated are marked by slightly modelled shapes. On the median line a groove along sternum is generally replaced by modelled shapes and only the linea alba is marked by only a groove. The lower boundary of thorax assumes the shape of a somewhat rounded arch. There is a slight indication of the external oblique bulging over the iliac crest. Shoulder blades are indicated as modelled shapes. The erector spinae is sometimes modelled. Size of thumb is normal. The vastus internus descends lower than vastus externus. Shins curve inwards. The external malleolus is lower and further back than the internal one. The little toes slant inwards. The metatarsal bones are lightly indicated.

The absolute chronology of this period is provided by the dedication of Rhombos on the Moschophoros, which may belong to the same time as a decree referring to the Panathenaia of 566. The Moschophoros is stylistically similar to early in this group giving us an approximate upper limit of 570. Additionally the terracotta kneeling boy
found in a well in the Agora and dated by its black-figure pottery sherd stratum to circa 550 shares the flat almond eyes, absence of the trapezium and pointed arch of the lower thorax that characterizes the late Tenea-Volomandra, furnishing us with a tentative lower boundary for the style.

===Melos group===
 555–540 BCE: figures of this period are simpler than before; their muscles are no longer separately accentuated. There is a tendency to flowing contour and a generalization of form. The tragus now sometimes assumes its natural form. The anterior part of the helix, which is directed backwards (crus helicis), is often prominent, and joined with the upper end of tragus. The antitragus is sometimes tentatively indicated, though wrongly placed. The anterior triangle of the neck is now better understood. Navel generally modelled as a depression. Indication of external oblique bulging over iliac crest. The lower boundary of abdomen occasionally forms a deep curve. Forearm and arm sometimes correctly semi-pronated; both directed towards body. Arms sometimes arched towards body below the armpit. Big toe projects a little further or same as second toe. Four smaller toes and toe nails curve gently downwards.

&quot;Astonishingly uniform&quot; the products of this period are found across the Greek world in large quantities. This group is named after the best preserved example of the era.
The date of this group is conjectured on the basis that one generation would be required for the development of the Melos group style prior to the more securely dated Anavysos-Ptoon style. However Richter argues there may be some relationship to other contemporary Greek art works, namely: the figures on Late Corinthian pottery exhibit the same degree of naturalism, and the archaic column sculptures from the Temple of Artemis Ephesos, thought to have been supplied by Croesus of Lydia, share some anatomical features. Of the important works that come done to us there is the colossal kouros from Megara, a transitional early piece from Boeotia (Thebes 3) and an early Parian example.

===Anavysos–Ptoon 12 group===
 540–520 BCE: this is the era of the Peisistratos dynasty and marks the assumption of Athens as the centre of artistic activity in Greece. In this period of great development the anatomical proportions become normal, the forms modelled and the spine clearly S-shaped. The head is now spherical and well-developed. The tragus takes on its natural form, the antitragus is also indicated. Hair occasionally descends as far as nape of neck. The sterno-mastoids when marked are indicated by modelled shapes. Their attachment to sternum and clavicles is often not indicated, this results in a continuous hollow groove or run above the clavicle. There is an attempt to indicate the backward curve of clavicle. Groove along linea alba is sometimes continued below the navel. The lower boundary of thorax arch is indicated. In the flanks the swelling of the external part is well developed. Lower boundary of abdomen assumes shape of small semicircle or deep curve. The erector spinae always indicated as modelled shape. Generally hand and forearm is semi-pronated. Hands are no longer attached to body but joined by short supports. The metacarpal bones are sometimes indicated. The bulge of the vastus internus increases. Toes are no longer parallel but do not recede along a continuous curve. Toes and nails point upwards. The articulation of joints is well rendered. Sometimes the flank of the advanced leg is placed forward and higher than receding leg.

The characteristics of this group can be observed on the Siphnian Treasury which is dated on external evidence before 525 BCE, therefore allowing time for the maturation of the style we can date the beginning of this group to, roughly, a generation prior. The earliest is perhaps the Munich kouros (Glyptothek 169) judging by the rendering of some of the muscles. Another significant Attic kouros in this style is the Anavyssos; its base reads:
:&quot;Stand and mourn Kroisos, first in line of battle and whom Ares&quot; [the god of war] &quot;killed&quot;
Two others are the Akropolis torso,
and the Rayet head.
The island of Keos supplies us with one of the best examples of the time,
notable for its advanced rendering of the back where the greatest protrusion of the back is level with that of the chest. Keos was likely under the cultural influence of Athens at this time and this kouros is comparable to and chronologically close to the Anavyssos kouros and akropolis head. From the Ptoan sanctuary in Boeotia we have the Ptoon 12 kouros (NAMA), &quot;softer, less sturdy&quot;, suggests; Richter asserts it is a local Boeotian product, not an import from Athens.

===Ptoon 20 group===
 520–485 BCE: the last stage in the development of the kouros type is the period in which the Greek sculptor attained a full knowledge of human anatomy and used it to create a harmonious, proportionate whole. The features that now become expressed are as follows. The lachrymal caruncle is sometimes indicated. Lips curved upwards only in early examples, the upper lip protrudes markedly over the lower and lips are well shaped. Hair is generally short or rolled up behind, it radiates from a point near vertex and carved in wavy strands. The structure of neck is now correct. There is an indication of swelling of trapezium on the outline of shoulder, becoming more pronounced over time. Clavicles assume an s-shape and lose themselves in shoulders. The lower boundary of thorax assumes a semicircular arch. The rectus abdominis, now reduced in number to two, with the top one incorporated into lower boundary of thorax. There is a small raised plane caused by projection of xiphoid appendage sometimes observable at lower end of sternum. Navel has fold of skin above in most examples. The lower boundary of abdomen assumes shape of semicircle, and the upper edge of torso with two concave curves becomes regular in form. Forearm and hand correctly pronated. Arms sometimes held free from body. Flanks; occasionally at first later regularly, flank and buttock of supporting leg rise in conformity with action.

This period is framed by the stasis of the Peisistratid era and the beginning of Athenian democracy and the Persian war. The upper limit of this group may be fixed by the sculpture of the temple of Apollo, Delphi. Architecturally earlier than the Hekatompedon of Athens the Delphi temple has a probable date of thus the kouroi of its pediment which betray the swelling trapezium and semicircular lower boundary of the abdomen can be associated with later examples of the group. Yet these same youths have a grooved, narrow lower boundary to the thorax and their flanks are level, suggesting that they are early specimens of the style. Richter (1960) names this group after the kouros Ptoon 20,
which is likely a Boeotian work dedicated by Pythias of Akraiphia and Aischrion to Apollo of the silver bow. This along with the torso form Eutresis (Thebes 7) indicate a vigorous Boeotian school of sculpture which may have existed to serve the Ptoan sanctuary. Attic production is considerable up to after which it seems to peter out. Important late kouroi from Athens include the Aristodikos kouros (Ptoon 20 group)
an akropolis statuette
and the bronze Apollo from Piraeus.

<text>Berlin (/ˈbɜːrlɪn/ BUR-lin) is a city in Green Lake and Waushara counties in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 5,571 at the 2020 census. Of this, 5,435 were in Green Lake County, and only 89 were in Waushara County. The city is located mostly within the Town of Berlin in Green Lake County, with a small portion extending into the Town of Aurora in Waushara County.

==History==
In 1845, Nathan H. Strong (1813–1852) became the first resident of what is today Berlin. He was joined by Hugh G. Martin, Hiram Barnes, and William Dickey. Their settlement was known as Strong&#x27;s Landing. In 1848, a post office was established. It was named Berlin after the capital of Prussia, now the capital of Germany. The first school house was built in 1850 and the first church in 1851. Berlin was incorporated as a city in 1857.

Wisconsin&#x27;s commercial cranberry industry was started in the Berlin area, as well as the first milk condensing factory in the mid-west, Carnation Company. From the mid-1860s to the 1990s, Berlin was called “the fur and leather city” due to its industry. These industries provided jobs and attracted immigrants from Scotland, Wales, Poland, and Italy to work. 

===Pronunciation===
Area residents put the accent on the first syllable of Berlin rather than on the second. It has been said that this was in reaction to the anti-German sentiment that swept across the United States during World War I, and that the accent was previously on the second syllable.

<doc id="545438" wikidata="Q4810531" url="?curid=545438" title="USS Harwood">
<text>USS &quot;Harwood&quot; (DD/DDE-861) was a of the United States Navy, in service from 1945 to 1971. She was transferred to Turkey on 17 December 1971 and sunk after being erroneously bombed by Turkish aircraft on 21 July 1974.

==Namesake==
Bruce Lawrence Harwood was born 10 February 1910 at Claremont, California. He enlisted in the Navy on 6 June 1935. After training as an aviation cadet at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, he was commissioned Ensign on 7 July 1939 and began flying duty with a torpedo plane squadron. He received the Navy Cross for extraordinary heroism on 24 August 1942 during the Solomon Islands campaign. Leading his squadron in an unsupported aerial torpedo raid against an Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) task force, Lieutenant Harwood pressed home the attack through antiaircraft fire. The squadron scored one certain and two estimated hits on an enemy aircraft carrier. He was awarded the Gold Star in lieu of a second Navy Cross for heroism as squadron commander 20 September-5 October 1942. Leading an attack group of bombers through adverse flying conditions, he located a force of IJN destroyers landing troops and supplies on Guadalcanal. Despite violent maneuvering by the IJN ships, he and his men scored at least one and probably more hits. On 4 October he led another attack group of torpedo planes against an IJN light cruiser and three destroyers. In spite of bad visibility and heavy AA fire, he pressed home the attack, scoring two positive and one possible hit on the cruiser. The following night he and his bombers flying on instruments through a violent tropical storm to Rekata Bay, bombed shore installations there despite fierce opposition from Japanese fighter planes which swarmed to the attack. Appointed Commander on 1 July 1944, he was killed 24 October 1944 when the received bomb hits which triggered a series of fatal explosions. While serving as air officer on the &quot;Princeton&quot;, he had received another Gold Star in lieu of a third Navy Cross.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Harwood&quot; was laid down by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding at San Pedro in California on 29 October 1944, launched on 22 May 1945, by Mrs. Bruce Lawrence Harwood, widow of Commander Harwood and commissioned on 28 September 1945.

===Operational history===
====1945–1971====
After shakedown along the California coast, &quot;Harwood&quot; joined the United States Seventh Fleet in Chinese waters. In addition to aiding in the occupation of Japan, the destroyer also participated in fleet and anti-submarine (ASW) exercises before returning to San Diego 21 February 1947. Harwood entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard after a second Western Pacific cruise in January 1949 to be equipped with the latest antisubmarine equipment. Redesignated DDE-861 on 4 March 1950, the escort destroyer reported to her new home port, Naval Station Newport, Rhode Island, on 11 September 1949 to participate in research on cold weather ASW operations as well as fleet and training exercises. Departing Norfolk in late August, &quot;Harwood&quot; made her first Mediterranean cruise with the United States Sixth Fleet and returned to the United States 10 November 1950.

Subsequent years fell into a pattern for &quot;Harwood&quot; as she engaged in varied training maneuvers and made yearly cruises to the Mediterranean. &quot;Harwood&quot; sailed 4 January 1957 for a 3-month ASW demonstration which took her along the South American coast to Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Panama and Cuba. Entering the New York Naval Shipyard on 2 May 1961, &quot;Harwood&quot; underwent a Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM II) overhaul. Her bridge was totally reconstructed, new types of torpedo tubes were installed, and the 76 mm antiaircraft guns were removed to accommodate a hangar and launching deck for Gyrodyne QH-50 DASH anti-submarine drones. Departing the yard 2 February 1962, &quot;Harwood&quot; sailed to her home port, Naval Station Mayport, Florida, and from there to the Caribbean Sea. When the Cuban Missile Crisis erupted in October 1962, &quot;Harwood&quot; and sailed with 4 hours&#x27; notice to join the blockading fleet &quot;quarantining&quot; Cuba. She returned to Mayport on 2 November 1962 and was redesignated DD-861 on 1 July 1963.

&quot;Harwood&quot; sailed for the Mediterranean on 6 August 1963 and provided ASW service during exercise &quot;Riptide IV&quot; en route. She transited the Straits of Gibraltar on the 22d for intense periods of anti-aircraft, anti-submarine, and binary chemical weapon exercises in the Mediterranean Sea. Returning home 23 December, the destroyer operated along the East Coast of the United States until getting under way 31 March 1964 for a brief visit to Brazil. She arrived at Annapolis, Maryland on 1 June, embarked midshipmen, and sailed for Europe. She visited Norway, Belgium, France, and the United Kingdom before debarking the &quot;Middies&quot; at Naval Station Norfolk.

In April 1965, she began overhaul and alterations at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. On 22 August she returned to Mayport en route to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, for refresher training. She operated along the coast of the United States&#x27; southern states until departing Mayport on 22 July 1966 for the Mediterranean deployment. On this tour she transited the Suez Canal and visited Aden and Kenya before rejoining the 6th Fleet in the Medediterranean Sea on 2 November 1965.

&quot;Harwood&quot; returned home 17 December. She operated out of Newport, off the New England coast until sailing for her 10th Mediterranean deployment 29 June 1967. Reaching Naval Station Rota, Spain on 10 July, &quot;Harwood&quot; soon joined the 6th Fleet, an element of stability in the ancient and volatile sea which had so recently been churned by the Six-Day War.

&quot;Harwood&quot; continued alternated operations along the East Coast of the United States and in the Caribbean Sea with the 2nd Fleet with deployments to the Mediterranean Sea until being decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 February 1973 after her transfer to the Turkish Navy on 17 December 1971.

====1971–1974====

&quot;Harwood&quot; was transferred to the Turkish Navy on 17 December 1971, and renamed TCG &quot;Kocatepe&quot; (D 354). The ship was bombed and sunk in error by Turkish Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and North American F-100 Super Sabre aircraft on 21 July 1974, mistaking it for a Greek vessel during Turkish landings on Cyprus. Fifty-four members of her crew were killed in the incident.

<text>Cherry Creek is a tributary of the South Platte River, long, in Colorado in the United States. The creek is named for the profusion of black chokecherry shrubs (&quot;Prunus virginiana demissa&quot;) that grow along its banks.

==Course==
Cherry Creek rises in the high plateau, east of the Front Range, in northwestern El Paso County. It flows north, through Castlewood Canyon State Park where it is spanned by the historic Cherry Creek Bridge, past Parker and through portions of Centennial and Aurora, and into southeast Denver. It flows northwest through Denver, becoming an urban stream and joining the South Platte River at Confluence Park in central Denver just west of downtown and approximately east of the foothills, near the site where the city of Denver was founded in 1858.

The Cherry Creek Dam, completed in 1950, forms Cherry Creek Reservoir in Cherry Creek State Park, providing flood control and irrigation. The dam lies immediately southeast and southwest of the Denver and Aurora city limits, respectively, approximately from the creek&#x27;s confluence with the South Platte.

The creek lends its name to the Cherry Creek neighborhood in south-central Denver, and also in particular to its Cherry Creek Shopping Center. In addition, the creek runs through the suburban Cherry Creek Public Schools district. The Cherry Creek Bike Path follows the creek from Confluence Park in downtown Denver through Cherry Creek State Park and south towards Parker and Castlewood Canyon.

==History==
Cherry Creek was the focus of the early part of the Pikes Peak Gold Rush in 1858 and 1859, when gold was discovered at the &quot;Cherry Creek diggings,&quot; in what was then western Kansas Territory. The first edition of the Rocky Mountain News on 23 April 1859 identified itself on the masthead as being located at &quot;Cherry Creek, K. T.&quot; Gold was discovered at Russellville (now in Douglas County) in the upper Cherry Creek drainage, and in the Platte River near its confluence with Cherry Creek.

Speer Boulevard, running along Cherry Creek, is part of Denver&#x27;s parks and parkway system, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Castlewood Dam was constructed on Cherry Creek in 1890 to provide irrigation to surrounding farms in Douglas County. After decades of notoriously leaking, the dam suffered an utter collapse following heavy rains at 1 am on 3 August 1933, resulting in a 15-foot wall of water rushing down Cherry Creek to Denver, some 15 miles away. Warnings to the city by 4 am allowed most people to move out of the way of the flood waters. The dam&#x27;s remnants are still visible at Castlewood Canyon State Park.

== Ecology ==
The creek itself is locally well known for its population of crayfish. Some local inhabitants catch and eat these crustaceans. The creek is also home to a large population of small fish (Including immature trout and sunfish, crappie, yellow perch and others). Large fish are largely absent, except when the Cherry Creek Dam is partially opened and floodwaters carry fish such as rainbow trout, brown trout, mature sunfish, walleye, and even northern pike downstream. The creek&#x27;s ecosystem was damaged during a drought in the first few years of the 21st century. Plants along the banks, damaged by the drought, dropped organic debris into the water, increasing biochemical oxygen demand substantially. Decreased flow also limited the ecosystem&#x27;s capacity to supply needed oxygen. Decreased flow also prevented the washing away of pollutants such as NPK fertilizers, insecticides and organic solvents. Water temperatures also rose during this period, compounding the problem. As of 2005, however, the creek is substantially healthier.

The area around the creek is also known for its snake population, which includes garter snakes, western hognose snakes, bullsnakes and occasionally rattlesnakes. Amphibians native to Colorado can be found at the creek as well. These include, the plains leopard frog, woodhouse&#x27;s frog, and the striped chorus frog. The bullfrog, a non-native species, is also located in the Cherry Creek. In recent years, bullfrogs have contributed to the decimation of native amphibian species populations at the creek.

For some of its distance, notably in the region of Four Mile Historical Park, the creek is flanked on each side by approximately of woods and scrub. This corridor is deliberately left semi-wild, though there is a dirt bike track on the northern bank. This corridor is one of the few places within the Denver metro area where the creek&#x27;s namesake plant, the chokecherry, can still be seen in a largely wild state. Large trees such as cottonwood are common, as are willows. Edible plants such as wild asparagus and prickly pear are occasionally found. Virginia creeper and imported plants such as the Russian olive, dandelion are present. Despite the limited area this corridor offers, raccoons, beaver, foxes, coyotes, and even deer are not uncommon sights along the creek. The beaver typically have lodges upstream (east) of Denver, but swim downstream to forage.

Petrified wood is extremely common in the creek. It is washed down, sometimes in fairly large pieces, from &#x27;petrified forests&#x27; upstream. Fossil mammal bones have also been found.

Historical records kept at what is now Four Mile Historical Park indicate that prior to the construction of the Cherry Creek Dam, the creek&#x27;s water level rose and fell regularly. Since the dam&#x27;s completion, however, this flood cycle has been interrupted. Now, the flow is regulated almost exclusively by the dam&#x27;s operators. The level of the creek is kept constant except when water needs to be vented from the Cherry Creek Reservoir. When the dam&#x27;s floodgates are opened for this venting, the creek&#x27;s level may rise as much as two feet, sometimes in less than an hour.

<doc id="545454" wikidata="Q3934862" url="?curid=545454" title="Richard Poore">
<text>Richard Poore or Poor (died 15 April 1237) was a medieval English bishop best known for his role in the establishment of Salisbury Cathedral and the City of Salisbury, moved from the nearby fortress of Old Sarum. He served as Bishop of Chichester, Bishop of Salisbury and Bishop of Durham.

==Early life==
Poore was probably the son of Richard of Ilchester, also known as Richard Toclive, who served as Bishop of Winchester. He was the brother of Herbert Poore, who served as bishop of Salisbury from 1194 to 1217. Richard studied under Stephen Langton at Paris. Richard Poore became Dean of Salisbury in 1197, was nominated unsuccessfully to the see of Winchester in 1205, and attained the see of Durham in 1213. His election to Durham was disallowed by Pope Innocent III before it was made public, probably because the pope knew that King John wished for the translation of his advisor John de Gray from the see of Norwich to Durham. During the interdict on England during King John&#x27;s reign, Richard returned to Paris to teach until the interdict was lifted.

It was probably during these years, before Poore held an episcopal office, that he completed Osmund&#x27;s &quot;Institutio&quot;, as well as his own works the &quot;Ordinale&quot; and the &quot;Consuetudinarium&quot;. The &quot;Institutio&quot; detailed the duties of the cathedral clergy at Salisbury, along with their rights. The &quot;Ordinale&quot; covered the liturgy, and how the various specialised services interacted with the basic divine service. The last work, the &quot;Consuetudinarium&quot;, gave the customs of Salisbury itself. Both the &quot;Consuetudinarium&quot; and the &quot;Ordinale&quot; were basically guides to the Sarum Rite, the usual form of liturgy in thirteenth century England. While he was dean, he also encouraged Robert of Flamborough to write a penitential.

Poore was Bishop of Chichester in 1215, being elected about 7 January and consecrated on 25 January at Reading. He attended the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215. He also served as one of the executors of King John&#x27;s estate.

==Bishop of Salisbury==

Poore&#x27;s brother Herbert died in 1217, and Richard succeeded to his position as Bishop of Salisbury by 27 June. He owed his move to the see of Salisbury to the papal legate, Cardinal Guala Bicchieri. It was during this time that he oversaw and helped plan the construction of the new Salisbury Cathedral as a replacement for the old cathedral at Old Sarum. He also laid out the town of Salisbury in 1219, to allow the workers building the cathedral a less cramped town than the old garrison town at Old Sarum. The cathedral, however, was not dedicated until 1258.

It was while Poore was at Salisbury that he issued his &quot;Statutes of Durham&quot;, which derived their name from the fact that he reissued them after being moved to the see of Durham. These statutes were influential on much other episcopal legislation. He also welcomed the first Franciscan friars to Salisbury around 1225. He served as a royal justice in 1218 and 1219. In 1223, with the fall from power of Peter des Roches (bishop of Winchester), Ranulph earl of Chester, and Falkes de Bréauté, Poore helped Hubert de Burgh take over the government, along with Stephen Langton and Jocelin of Wells (bishop of Bath and Wells). The four men worked together to govern England for the next five years.

While Poore was at Salisbury, he took part in the translation of St Wulfstan in 1218, and in the translation of Saint Thomas Becket&#x27;s relics in 1220. At the later event, he was the only other bishop besides Stephen Langton actually to examine Becket&#x27;s body. Poore petitioned Pope Gregory IX to have the second bishop of Salisbury, Osmund de Sees, canonized, but was unsuccessful. Osmund was eventually made a saint in 1457.

==Bishop of Durham==
Poore was translated to the see of Durham on 14 May 1228. Afterwards he withdrew from royal service, although he was briefly back in service when Peter des Roches returned to power in late 1232 and early 1233. At Durham, he inherited a quarrel between the bishop and the cathedral chapter that mainly involved the election of the prior and the right of the bishop to undertake visitations of the priory. The quarrel had begun under Richard Marsh, and had led to appeals to the papal curia from the monks. Soon after coming to Durham, Richard issued a set of detailed constitutions that governed many of the relations between the bishop, the prior, and the cathedral chapter, and which was the basis of church government in Durham until the Dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII.

==Legacy and death==
In 1220, while Poore was bishop of Salisbury, he ordered his clergy to instruct a few children so that the children might in turn teach the rest of the children in basic church doctrine and prayers. He also had the clergy preach every Sunday that children should not be left alone in a house with a fire or water. Also during his time in Salisbury, he promoted the education of boys by endowing some schoolmasters with benefices provided they did not charge for instruction. In 1237, he established a retirement house for the old and infirm clergy of the diocese of Durham. Poore was also an opponent of pluralism, the holding of more than one benefice at the same time. He not only held that a clerk receiving a new benefice should give up the old one, but that if the clerk protested about the loss, he should lose both benefices. He also decreed that the clergy should not be involved in &quot;worldly business&quot;. Poore House at Bishop Wordsworth&#x27;s School, Salisbury is named in honour of his legacy to Salisbury schools.

Poore died on 15 April 1237 at the manor of Tarrant Keyneston in Dorset. His tomb was claimed for both Durham and Salisbury, but most likely he was buried in the church at Tarrant Keyneston which was what he had wished. He is commemorated with a statue in niche 170 on the west front of Salisbury Cathedral.

<text>&quot;USS Vogelgesang&quot; (DD-862) was a in the United States Navy. She was named for Rear Admiral Carl Theodore Vogelgesang USN (1869–1927).

&quot;Vogelgesang&quot; was laid down by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation at Staten Island in New York on 3 August 1944, launched on 15 January 1945 by Miss Zenaide Vogelgesang and commissioned on 28 April 1945.

==Service history==
&quot;Vogelgesang&quot; alternated operations along the United States East Coast and in the Caribbean Sea with the Second Fleet with deployments to the Mediterranean with the Sixth Fleet, underwent an extensive Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) overhaul at the Boston Naval Shipyard between 1 March 1962 and 31 January 1963, served as part of the Project &quot;Gemini&quot; recovery force which picked up the unmanned experimental Gemini 2 spacecraft in January 1965, and served as plane guard for carriers on &quot;Yankee Station&quot; in the Tonkin Gulf, participated in &quot;Sea Dragon&quot; operations, patrolled on search and rescue duties and carried out naval gunfire support missions during the Vietnam War.

===1945–1959===
&quot;Vogelgesang&quot; conducted shakedown training out of Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, from mid-May to late June and returned to New York on 24 June for post-shakedown availability. In July, she moved to Newport, Rhode Island, for gunnery exercises and, in August, began duty at Norfolk as a training platform for destroyer nucleus crews. In October, she interrupted her training schedule to take part in the Navy Day festivities at New York but resumed those duties in November. For the next two years, the destroyer operated out of Norfolk, along the east coast, and in the West Indies, conducting exercises both independently and in company with other units of the United States Atlantic Fleet. On 10 November 1947, she stood out of Norfolk on her first deployment to the Mediterranean Sea. She arrived at Gibraltar on 20 November and, after a little more than three months of exercises and port visits, departed the &quot;middle sea&quot; on 2 March 1948.

The warship arrived back in Norfolk on 11 March and resumed a normal schedule of Second Fleet operations. She ranged up and down the east coast until 4 January 1949 at which time she headed back to the Mediterranean. &quot;Vogelgesang&quot; completed her second deployment to the Sixth Fleet on 14 May, departed Gibraltar that day, reentered Norfolk on the 23d, and commenced a two-month upkeep period.

Over the next eight years, &quot;Vogelgesang&quot; alternated five deployments to the Mediterranean with tours of duty along the east coast and in the West Indies. In addition, she also visited northern European ports during the summer of 1956 while on a midshipman training cruise. Her five Mediterranean tours consisted of normal training operations with units of the Sixth Fleet and with elements of Allied navies as well as port visits at various points throughout the Mediterranean. In 1957, there came a change in &quot;Vogelgesang&#x27;s&quot; routine of the previous eight years. She deployed to the Mediterranean once more in July; but, on this deployment, she added service in the Indian Ocean. She added Aden and Massawa in Eritrea to her list of ports of call. In December, when she returned to the Mediterranean for another deployment with the Sixth Fleet, she again transited the Suez Canal, repeated her former visits to middle eastern ports, and added Bahrain Island and Abadan, Iran, to her itinerary.

During the following nine years, &quot;Vogelgesang&quot; continue her schedule of alternating Mediterranean cruises and Sixth Fleet operations.

===1960–1970===
The motto: Drauf Und Dran was established in 1960 by Cdr. Robert P. Foreman, Commanding Officer during a visit to the ship by officers of the German Navy whose ships were visiting the Charleston, SC Naval Base. In October, 1960, she departed for a goodwill trip with four other ships to South America and Africa called SOLANT AMITY as part of President Eisenhower&#x27;s &quot;People to People Program.&quot; Ports of call included Trinidad, Belem Brazil, Senegal, Guinea, Gambia, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Congo, and South Africa. Highlights of the trip included members of the crew singing Christmas carols for Milton Margai, the first prime minister of an independent Sierra Leone at his residence. The prime minister invited the crew into his home, offered everyone a glass of wine, and played the violin for us. In early 1961, Vogelgesang and USS Gearing (DD-710) were called to intercept the Santa Maria, a Portuguese cruise ship which had been hijacked in the Caribbean. Both ships left Abidjan, Ivory Coast, crossed the Atlantic, and followed Santa Maria into Recife, Brazil. The story is featured in Charles Kuralt&#x27;s book, A Life on the Road. During the African tour, Vogelgesang diverted course and conducted a brief &quot;Crossing the Line&quot; ceremony at 0 degrees latitude and 0 degrees longitude.

In 1961 and 1962, she provided support for the Project &quot;Mercury&quot; space shot.

On 1 March 1962, she entered the Boston Naval Shipyard to begin a fleet rehabilitation and modernization (FRAM) overhaul. For the next 10 months, she underwent extensive structural changes as well as equipment installation to improve greatly her anti-submarine warfare capabilities. She completed her FRAM conversion on 31 January 1963 then deployed to Guantanamo Bay where she did picket duty as part of the post-Cuban Missile Crisis operation. During this deployment the &quot;Vogelgesang&quot; was charged with a humanitarian mission to the Dominican Republic. She resumed normal operations at Norfolk. In 1964, she participated in two binational exercises with Canadian ships, CANUS SILEX in March and CANUS SLAMEX in September.

In October and November, she returned to European waters to participate in a large amphibious exercise, &quot;Operation Steel Pike I,&quot; carried out on the Atlantic coast of Spain. In January 1965, the warship served as part of the recovery force which picked up an unmanned experimental &quot;Gemini&quot; spacecraft. In June, she deployed to the Mediterranean once again for a two-month tour of duty with the Sixth Fleet. &quot;Vogelgesang&quot; resumed Second Fleet operations early in September following another joint United States-Canadian exercise in August on her way back from Europe. On 3 December, she began her first regular overhaul since her FRAM conversion when she entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard.

&quot;Vogelgesang&quot; completed overhaul and sea trials on 22 March 1966 and resumed normal duty with the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. That assignment lasted until 1 June at which time she and the other ships of Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 32 steamed out of Norfolk for a deployment to the western Pacific with Commander Destroyer Division 322 (COMDESDIV 322) embarked. Steaming by way of the Panama Canal, Pearl Harbor, and Guam, she and the other ships of Destroyer Squadron 32 reported for duty with the Seventh Fleet at Subic Bay in the Philippines on 15 July. On 19 July, she headed for the Gulf of Tonkin in the screen of the aircraft carrier . The task group arrived in the gulf on 28 July, and &quot;Vogelgesang&quot; provided anti-submarine defense and plane guard services as the carrier&#x27;s air group struck at targets in North Vietnam. On 15 August, the destroyer closed the shores of South Vietnam to provide gunfire support for troops operating ashore. On the night of 18 and 19 August, her 5 inch guns succeeded in breaking up a company-strength Viet Cong attack on a Popular Forces outpost near Huong Dien. Reports credited her main battery with killing 70 and wounding 40 of the attacking guerrillas. In addition to service in Vietnamese waters, the warship made visits to Hong Kong and Kaohsiung on Taiwan as well as periodic stops at Subic Bay for upkeep and replenishments. &quot;Vogelgesang&quot; concluded her only combat cruise during the Vietnam War on 10 November when she stood out of Subic Bay, bound — via the Indian Ocean, the Suez Canal, and the Mediterranean Sea — for Norfolk. She completed her round-the-world cruise at her home port on 17 December.

After post-deployment standdown, &quot;Vogelgesang&quot; resumed her schedule alternating Mediterranean cruises with operations out of Norfolk. She spent the first 10 months of 1967 engaged in training operations along the east coast and in the West Indies. On 14 November 1967, the warship stood out of Norfolk for her first tour of duty with the Sixth Fleet since 1965. On 24 November, she conducted turnover ceremonies at the Spanish island of Majorca and officially joined the Sixth Fleet. For the next five months, the destroyer ranged the length and breadth of the Mediterranean, conducting training evolutions and making port visits. On 13 April 1968, she departed Málaga, Spain, to return to Norfolk.

After a 10-day transit, she reentered her home port on the 23rd. She resumed normal Second Fleet operations until 22 July at which time she departed Norfolk for a cruise to South American waters to participate in UNITAS IX, a series of multinational exercises with units of various Latin American navies. She concluded that assignment on 3 September when she reentered Norfolk.

Normal operations and a series of tender availabilities in preparation for overhaul occupied her time from September 1968 to June 1969. On 2 June 1969, she departed Norfolk, en route to Boston. The warship entered the Boston Naval Shipyard and commenced regular overhaul on 5 June. She concluded sea trials successfully late in September and departed Boston on 3 October and arrived in Norfolk on the 5th. For the remainder of the year, the ship conducted post-repair exercises and refresher training in the Guantanamo Bay operating area. She returned to Norfolk on 14 December and remained in port for the rest of the year.

===1970–1980===
Normal operations out of Norfolk occupied her until 30 April 1970 at which time she embarked upon another Mediterranean tour of duty. She changed operational control to Sixth Fleet on 10 May and conducted turnover at Majorca between the 12th and the 17th. For the first four months of the deployment, &quot;Vogelgesang&quot; conducted normal Sixth Fleet operations — port visits and training evolutions. However, early in September, she joined a special contingency force assembled in the eastern Mediterranean in response to Syrian intervention in the Jordanian civil war on the side of militant, anti-government, Arab guerrillas. She cruised that portion of the sea from 5 September to 6 October. Finally, however, the American show of force succeeded in getting the Syrian forces to withdraw from Jordan, and &quot;Vogelgesang&quot; rejoined Sixth Fleet. On 8 November, she departed Palma de Majorca to return home.

The warship reentered Norfolk on 17 November and remained there through the end of the year. The destroyer resumed normal Second Fleet operations early in 1971 and remained so occupied for the next 11 months.

On 1 December 1971, she departed Norfolk for another tour of duty with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. She arrived in port at Rota, Spain, on the 9th and conducted turnover ceremonies. For the following six months, &quot;Vogelgesang&quot; operated throughout the Mediterranean, engaged in the usual round of exercises and port visits. After turnover in Rota, the destroyer got underway on 23 June to return to Norfolk.

On the 29th, she steamed into Hampton Roads and soon began a tender availability alongside the destroyer tender . She conducted operations out of Norfolk until 10 October at which time she began an extended repair period at the Norfolk Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Corp. The warship completed repairs on 26 January 1973 and finished sea trials by early February. She conducted normal operations for the remainder of the year, steaming as far south as the West Indies.

On 10 January 1974, &quot;Vogelgesang&quot; was transferred from DesRon 2 to DesRon 28 and reassigned to Naval Reserve training duty. On 1 March, her home port was changed from Norfolk to Newport, Rhode Island. On 19 March, she headed out of Norfolk, bound for her new home port, where she arrived the following day. From that time, &quot;Vogelgesang&quot; operated at and out of Newport as a training platform for naval reservists, NROTC midshipmen, and OCS students. She alternated short periods at sea with weeks in port as a stationary training platform. Periodically, however, she made extended training cruises down the east coast to the West Indies. At the beginning of 1980, the destroyer continued to serve with the Naval Reserve training program, based at Newport.

&quot;Vogelgesang&quot; earned two battle stars for service during the Vietnam War.
===Decommissioning and transfer===
&quot;Vogelgesang&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 24 February 1982, transferred to Mexico and renamed &quot;Quetzalcoatl&quot; (E-03). In 1993, the ship had a single Bofors 57 mm gun mounted in &quot;B&quot; position, between the forward 5 inch mount and the ship&#x27;s bridge. Also during that year, the ship was renamed &quot;Ilhuicamina&quot; with the pennant number E-10, although by 2002 the ship had reverted to the name &quot;Quetzalcoatl&quot;. In 1994, the ASROC launcher and anti-submarine torpedo tubes were removed. In 2001, the ship again changed Pennant number, to D 101. She was decommissioned by the Mexican Navy in late 2002. On 24 November 2006, the ship was scuttled to form an artificial reef.
Her main tripod mast is on display in Mexican Pacific Fleet headquarters, Mexico.

<text>John Babbitt McNair (November 20, 1889 – June 14, 1968) was the 23rd premier of New Brunswick from 1940 to 1952. He worked as a lawyer, politician and judge.

Born in Andover, New Brunswick, he graduated from the University of New Brunswick in 1911 with a B.A. degree. Awarded a Rhodes Scholarship, at Oxford University he earned a B.A. in 1913 and a Bachelor of Civil Law degree in 1914, graduating with first-class honours.

At the onset of World War I he enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force and served on the battlefields of France and Belgium. Captain McNair served again during World War II as a member of the Royal Canadian Artillery Reserves.

John McNair was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in 1935 New Brunswick general election and served as Attorney-General in the government of Premier Dysart and served as president of the Liberal Party of New Brunswick from 1932 to 1940. He lost his seat in the 1939 election but returned in 1940, succeeding Dysart as leader of the party and premier.

Despite province wide protests, on April 27, 1950 McNair&#x27;s government implemented a four percent provincial sales tax to help finance the public education system and social services.

McNair served as premier for twelve years until the defeat of his government in 1952 at which time he returned to the practise of law. In 1955 he was named Chief Justice of New Brunswick and became the 22nd Lieutenant Governor of the province in 1965.

In 1967 he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada.

== Early life ==

The Honourable John Babbitt McNair was born to James McNair and Francis Anne Lewis on November 20, 1889, in Andover, Victoria County, New Brunswick. As a youth he attended Andover Grammar School and Florenceville Consolidated School before enrolling at the University of New Brunswick in 1907. He distinguished himself as a scholar before graduating with his B.A. in 1911, receiving numerous awards including the Lieutenant-Governors Award and served as his class valedictorian. He was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to attend Oxford University, where he further distinguished himself by earning first-class honours, and received a B.A. in 1913 and a B.C.L. in 1914.

Following the outbreak of the First World War, McNair enlisted with the Armed Forces and served with the Canadian Expeditionary Force in France and Germany. By the war&#x27;s close he had attained the rank of Lieutenant. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, McNair volunteered once again and served as a captain in the Royal Canadian Artillery Reserves.

Following his return to New Brunswick in 1919, McNair was admitted to the bar and entered into a law partnership with J.J.F. Winslow at Fredericton. Over the next 15 years he became a leading member of several fraternal, religious and other community organizations. He also became a barrister and solicitor of some note, eventually being appointed a King&#x27;s Counsel on July 16, 1935.

== Political career ==

It was during this period that McNair became involved in public affairs. A rising-star in the Liberal Party, in October 1932 he became President of the New Brunswick Liberal Association. He held this position until 1940. During the election campaign of June 1935, McNair was instrumental in A. Alison Dysart&#x27;s successful election to the premier&#x27;s office. At the same election, the 46-year-old McNair was elected to the Legislative Assembly as a representative for York County.

McNair was appointed Attorney-General in Premier Dysart&#x27;s cabinet on July 16, 1935. He held this position for the next seventeen years, until his retirement from politics in 1952. In the Legislative Chambers, McNair distinguished himself as a gifted speaker and was widely regarded as the most able member of Dysart&#x27;s government. Dysart frequently suffered from ill-health and during his many absences from the Legislature McNair served as Acting premier. Although defeated in York County at the general election of November 20, 1939, a by-election was created for McNair in Victoria County and on January 20, 1940 he was re-elected.

Shortly afterwards Dysart retired from political life, and on March 13, 1940 McNair was sworn in as premier. He also continued as Attorney-General and, with a reputation as a hands-on administrator, he also briefly added the portfolios of Labour, Health and Labour, and Lands and Mines to his responsibilities. Considered to have been New Brunswick&#x27;s most intellectually gifted premier, McNair was also a shrewd politician and excellent debater who regularly used his cutting wit to fend off criticism from the Opposition benches. He was perhaps the last premier to write all his own speeches, which he did by hand either at his home on Waterloo Row or at his cabin at Gordon Vale.

Governing the province during the war years and through harsh economic times, McNair is credited with introducing a succession of budgetary surpluses, undertaking a massive rural electrification program, improving education in rural areas, expanding the role of the civil service, centralizing the provincial government offices and New Brunswick Electric Power Commission in Fredericton. Following the war, he introduced a variety of social benefit programs, began the modernization of the highway system, and created a Department of Industry and Reconstruction to ensure a smooth economic and social transition for the province from wartime to peacetime.
He was also instrumental in modernizing politics. For the August 1944 general election, McNair became the first politician in Canada to employ the services of a professional advertising agency to direct a political campaign. Following this tremendously successful campaign, the Liberals won all but five seats in the Legislature. After a similar election campaign in June 1948, McNair&#x27;s Liberals were returned to office with a similar majority. McNair continued as premier until his party&#x27;s defeat at the polls in 1952.

== Later years and death ==

McNair then returned to his Fredericton law practice. In July 1955 he was appointed a Justice in Appeal, Supreme Court of New Brunswick. In October 1955 he was appointed Chief Justice in Appeal, Supreme Court of New Brunswick. He retired from the bench in 1964 on account of age. During his career after politics, McNair was also a member of the Senate for the University of New Brunswick, Chairman of the Selection Committee for the Awarding of the Beaverbrook Scholarships, and a member of the Beaverbrook Art Gallery Board.

In June 1965, at age 76, McNair was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick. He held this position until January 31, 1968 when illness forced him to resign. He died six months later on June 14, 1968.

== Personal life ==

McNair married Marion MacGregor Crocket on May 17, 1921, and they had three daughters and one son. Not long after McNair assumed the premiership, his wife&#x27;s health deteriorated in an alarming fashion and she spent much of her time in hospitals. Therefore, in addition to assuming the responsibility for the affairs of the province, McNair also shouldered the heavy responsibility of raising four children. Following the death of his first wife in 1961, McNair married Margaret Jones on April 27, 1963.

Among the many awards the Hon. John B. McNair received in his life were an honorary L.L.D. from the University of New Brunswick in 1938 and an honorary D.C.L. from Mount Allison University in 1951. He was designated a Companion of the Order of Canada on July 6, 1967, but the award had to be presented posthumously as the scheduled ceremony did not take place until September 23, 1968.

<text>The second USS &quot;Steinaker&quot; (DD-863/DDR-863/DD-863) was a of the United States Navy.

==Namesake==
Donald Baur Steinaker was born on 15 September 1922 at Syracuse, New York. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps Reserve on 20 March 1941. He served at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, South Carolina, and at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, before he was sent to the South Pacific for service during World War II.

During the Guadalcanal campaign, Private First Class Steinaker was killed in action at the Matanikau River on Guadalcanal on 9 October 1942 when his unit was attacked during a heavy Japanese offensive. He refused to be dislodged from his position and died at his post. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross.

The destroyer escort was named for him, but its construction was cancelled in 1944.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Steinaker&quot; was laid down by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation at Staten Island in New York on 1 September 1944, launched on 13 February 1945 by Miss Carol Steinaker and commissioned on 26 May 1945.

==History==
&quot;Steinaker&quot; held her shakedown cruise off Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and returned to Norfolk, Virginia, her home port, where she acted as a training ship for the remainder of the year. Until 1952, the destroyer alternated her operations between the east coast with the Atlantic Fleet and deployment with the 6th Fleet. She was deployed to the Mediterranean in 1947, 1949, 1950, 1951, and the first five months of 1952.

&quot;Steinaker&quot; entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 1 July 1952 for conversion to a radar picket destroyer and was classified as DDR-863. The work was completed on 28 February 1953 and shakedown at Guantanamo Bay followed. She made her first deployment to the 6th Fleet as a picket destroyer from 16 September to 3 February 1954. She also served with the 6th Fleet for portions of 1955, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1962, 1963, and 1965. In 1964, the destroyer was converted under the FRAM program and given modern antisubmarine weapons and detection equipment. On 1 July of that year, she resumed the designation, DD-863.

&quot;Steinaker&quot; was in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean for two months in 1967 as a unit of the Middle East Force. On 26 March 1968, she stood out of Norfolk headed for her first tour in the western Pacific. She transited the Panama Canal on 31 March and—after calling briefly at San Diego, Pearl Harbor, Midway, Guam, and the Philippine Islands—arrived off Vietnam.

&quot;Steinaker&quot; was assigned to the 7th Fleet from 20 May through 1 October and participated in naval gunfire support operations off Bình Thuận and Phú Yên provinces; &quot;Sea Dragon&quot; operations off the coast of North Vietnam to interdict seaborne infiltration of Communist forces into South Vietnam; and antiaircraft picket duty off the demilitarized zone. She also operated with aircraft carriers conducting strikes against North Vietnam.

&quot;Steinaker&quot; returned to the east coast of the United States, via Subic Bay, Singapore, Yokosuka, and Okinawa. She arrived at Norfolk on 5 November 1968 and resumed Atlantic Fleet operations until 9 January 1970. At that time, she was assigned to NATO&#x27;s Standing Naval Force, Atlantic. This tour lasted until 23 July 1970. She made another voyage to the Mediterranean from 23 February to 23 July 1971 and returned to the North Atlantic from 10 July to 18 November 1972.

&quot;Steinaker&quot; was transferred to Destroyer Squadron 10, Naval Reserve Force, on 1 July 1973 and changed her home port to Baltimore. Into December 1974, she serves as a training ship for reserves.

&quot;Steinaker&quot; received two battle stars for service in Vietnam.

&quot;Steinaker&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 24 February 1982, transferred to Mexico and renamed &quot;Netzahualcoyotl&quot;.

<text>School-to-work transition is a phrase referring to on-the-job training, apprenticeships, cooperative education agreements or other programs designed to prepare students to enter the job market. This education system is primarily employed in the United States, partially as a response to work training as it is done in Asia.

School to Work is a system to introduce the philosophy of school-based, work-based, and connecting activities as early as kindergarten to expose students to potential future careers. School to Work emphasizes lifelong learning.

School to Work is funded and sponsored at the federal level by the U.S. Department of Labor and U.S. Department of Education. At the state level in states like Arizona, the grant is administered by the Arizona Department of Commerce, School to Work Division. This grant was funded for a maximum of five years with decreasing funds years three through five.

An example of county level involvement is the Cochise County School to Work Consortia in Arizona. It is composed of more than fifty Cochise County public and private schools, kindergarten through four-year university level, local and community-based organizations, and more than one hundred supporting business partners.

STW is part of a comprehensive education reform movement which includes formulating new standards which emphasize higher order thinking skills, new standards based assessments, and graduation exams, such as the Certificate of Initial Mastery which insure that students are ready for job training or college prep by age 16. Reformers believe that it is important and egalitarian that all students graduate ready for jobs and ready for college, rather than tracking students one way or the other.

== Critics ==

&quot;Back to basics&quot; traditionalists observe that in Europe, apprenticeships typically mean that the worker essentially ends their formal education after age 16, and works full-time at reduced pay in exchange for learning &quot;job skills&quot; such as assembling automobiles. Some believe that it was better to have students who were not bound for college concentrate on career schools, while academic students should spend class time learning core academic subjects such as history or science rather than job-shadowing at a hospital or auto dealer. A student in North Dakota would have little opportunity to learn to be an auto designer, while one in Alabama would have little opportunity to do job shadowing at a major software company if job training were allocated according to local human resource needs, as many programs are structured. Local businesses also need to structure their operations to accommodate student workers, and transportation since typically schools are situated close to homes, and not businesses which are typically a car or transit commute away from homes.

The Michigan STW Initiative states &quot;students work without pay for two to three hours each day&quot; and &quot;students are able to perform what might otherwise be hazardous order work.&quot; which would contradict child labor laws. Data would be shared with state STW partnership network and local labor market areas which might be an invasion of privacy. The state would utilize the national industry-recognized skill certificates when developed, which would be the Certificate of Initial Mastery. Critics call this a government-controlled passport to work. Michigan Rep. Harold J. Voorhees expressed concern that, with full implementation, a child would not be employed without this Certificate.

<doc id="545475" wikidata="Q7870022" url="?curid=545475" title="USS Harold J. Ellison (DD-864)">
<text>USS &quot;Harold J. Ellison (DD-864) was a in service with the [[United States Navy]] from 1945 to 1983. She was then transferred to [[Pakistan]] and renamed Shah Jahan&quot; (D-164). The ship was finally sunk as a target in 1994.

==Namesake==
Harold John Ellison (17 January 1917 – 4 June 1942) was born in Buffalo, New York. He was appointed Ensign 20 October 1941 after completing flight training. Soon afterwards he reported to Torpedo Squadron 8 on board the aircraft carrier .

In the pivotal Battle of Midway on 4 June 1942 Ellison, piloting a Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bomber, and his comrades led a torpedo attack on the Japanese carriers, pressing home the attack without fighter cover. Though no hits were scored and all of the squadron&#x27;s aircraft were shot down, the attack had disrupted the Japanese formation, delaying their preparations for a second strike. Subsequent attacks by Torpedo Squadron 6 and Torpedo Squadron 3 continued this disruption, as well as occupying the Japanese combat air patrol while U.S. Navy dive bombers slipped in virtually unnoticed. These subsequently attacked the Japanese aircraft carriers with great success, so that, barely an hour after Torpedo 8&#x27;s sacrifice, three Japanese carriers were in flames. Ensign Ellison was classified as &quot;presumed dead&quot; on 5 June 1942 and posthumously awarded the Navy Cross posthumously for his gallantry at Midway.

The U.S. Navy destroyer escort was named in his honor, but was cancelled in 1944 while under construction.

==History==
===1945–1983===
&quot;Harold J. Ellison&quot; was laid down by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation at Staten Island, New York on 3 October 1944, launched on 14 March 1945 by Mrs. Audrey Ellison, the widow of Ensign Ellison and commissioned on 23 June 1945.

Although scheduled to join the Pacific Fleet for the final assault on Japan, &quot;Harold J. Ellison&quot; was completing her shakedown cruise when the surrender came on 15 August 1945. Homeported at Naval Station Norfolk, she operated in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea for the next two years, taking part in United States Navy Reserve training cruises, and anti-submarine warfare exercises.

Beginning in 1947, when she sailed from Norfolk on 10 November, &quot;Harold J. Ellison&quot; added periodic cruises to the Mediterranean Sea with the 6th Fleet to her operations, helping to keep the peace and protect American interests in this area. She participated in the search for lost British submarine in April 1951, and added cruises to the Caribbean and northern Europe in 1953.

From 1954 to 1956 she continued tactical training along the United States East Coast and participated in European cruises. Following the 1956 Suez crisis, &quot;Harold J. Ellison&quot;, took part in peacekeeping operations in the Eastern Mediterranean during 1957.

The following summer, the Lebanon crisis occurred as the government of Lebanon experienced a division between pro-Western and pro-Arab sides. The destroyer screened aircraft carrier and heavy cruiser from July to September 1958 while the 6th Fleet landed United States Marines at the request of Lebanese President Camille Chamoun.

In September 1958, she operated with &quot;Task Group Alfa&quot; for the training of new tactics and equipment in antisubmarine warfare. &quot;Harold J. Ellison&quot; remained on this duty until April 1959.

The ship returned to her pattern of cruises to the Mediterranean in 1959, departing Norfolk on 21 September. In 1960, her homeport became Charleston, South Carolina, and in 1961, during her tenth deployment to the 6th Fleet, the ship cruised in the Persian Gulf during the crisis in Kuwait. &quot;Harold J. Ellison&quot; added a new function in January 1962, when she was assigned to Project Mercury as a part of the recovery unit in the Atlantic Ocean. In 1962, she underwent an extensive Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM I) overhaul at the Brooklyn Naval Shipyard. The destroyer rejoined the fleet in early 1963 and through 1964 continued to operate on training and readiness exercises off the Atlantic coast.

On 29 September 1965, &quot;Harold J. Ellison&quot; departed Norfolk with Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 24 and headed via the Panama Canal for the Pacific Ocean. She served as plane guard for aircraft carriers on &quot;Yankee Station&quot; in the Tonkin Gulf, participated in &quot;Sea Dragon&quot; operations, patrolled on search and rescue duties and carried out naval gunfire support missions during the Vietnam War. Leaving Southeast Asia by steaming eastward through the Suez Canal, she completed her round-the-world cruise upon returning to Norfolk in April 1966. In July she entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for an overhaul which lasted for the rest of the year. After sea trials and refresher training early in 1967, &quot;Harold J. Ellison&quot; rejoined the United States Atlantic Fleet. She visited Brazil and crossed the equator on her way around Africa en route to the Middle East. During a port visit in Ethiopia, Emperor Haile Selassie was a guest aboard the ship. &quot;Harold J. Ellison&quot; also visited Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique and Pakistan and returned in March 1971.

In July 1971, &quot;Harold J. Ellison&quot; was assigned to DesRon 36 and operated mainly in the Atlantic Ocean. On 1 July 1972, the destroyer was assigned to the DesRon 34 of the Navy Reserve. During the first half of 1973, she underwent an overhaul at Portsmouth, Virginia. Following her yard period, she sailed the Caribbean Sea, visiting Port-au-Prince, San Juan, Puerto Rico and Bermuda.

On 19 July 1974, &quot;Harold J. Ellison&quot; departed Norfolk for the Mediterranean Sea with the aircraft carrier . The destroyer was transferred to DesRon 30 on 30 November 1974 and her homeport was changed to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. For her remaining career in the U.S. Navy, she continued to train reservists on cruises along the U.S. East Coast or to the Caribbean Sea. &quot;Harold J. Ellison&quot; was decommissioned on 1 October 1983. Together with , which was decommissioned on the same day, she was the last in the United States Navy.

===Transfer to Pakistan===

&quot;Harold J. Ellison&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 October 1983, transferred to Pakistan and renamed &quot;Shah Jahan&quot; (D-164). In 1994, she was cannibalized for parts and sunk as a target vessel by a PAF Dassault Mirage-5 of the Haiders with an Exocet Anti-Ship missile during Exercise Nasim-ul-Bahr.

<doc id="545476" wikidata="Q853976" url="?curid=545476" title="First Battle of Ypres">
<text>The First Battle of Ypres (, , – was a battle of the First World War, fought on the Western Front around Ypres, in West Flanders, Belgium. The battle was part of the First Battle of Flanders, in which German, French, Belgian armies and the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) fought from Arras in France to Nieuwpoort (Nieuport) on the Belgian coast, from 10 October to mid-November. The battles at Ypres began at the end of the Race to the Sea, reciprocal attempts by the German and Franco-British armies to advance past the northern flank of their opponents. North of Ypres, the fighting continued in the Battle of the Yser between the German 4th Army, the Belgian army and French marines.

The fighting has been divided into five stages, an encounter battle from 19 to 21 October, the Battle of Langemarck from 21 to 24 October, the battles at La Bassée and Armentières to 2 November, coincident with more Allied attacks at Ypres and the Battle of Gheluvelt a fourth phase with the last big German offensive, which culminated at the Battle of Nonne Bosschen on 11 November, then local operations which faded out in late November. Brigadier-General James Edmonds, the British official historian, wrote in the History of the Great War, that the II Corps battle at La Bassée could be taken as separate but that the battles from Armentières to Messines and Ypres, were better understood as one battle in two parts, an offensive by III Corps and the Cavalry Corps from 12 to 18 October against which the Germans retired and an offensive by the German 6th Army and 4th Army from 19 October to 2 November, which from 30 October, took place mainly north of the Lys, when the battles of Armentières and Messines merged with the Battles of Ypres.

Attacks by the BEF (Field Marshal Sir John French) the Belgians and the French Eighth Army in Belgium made little progress beyond Ypres. The German 4th and 6th Armies took small amounts of ground, at great cost to both sides, during the Battle of the Yser and further south at Ypres. General Erich von Falkenhayn, head of the (OHL, the German General Staff), then tried a limited offensive to capture Ypres and Mont Kemmel (Kemmelberg), from 19 October to 22 November. Neither side had moved forces to Flanders fast enough to obtain a decisive victory and by November both sides were exhausted. The armies were short of ammunition, suffering from low morale and some infantry units refused orders. The autumn battles in Flanders had become static, attrition operations, unlike the battles of manoeuvre in the summer. French, British and Belgian troops, in improvised field defences, repulsed German attacks for four weeks. From 21 to 23 October, German reservists had made mass attacks at Langemarck (Langemark), with losses of up to to little effect.

Warfare between mass armies, equipped with the weapons of the Industrial Revolution and its later developments, proved to be indecisive, because field fortifications neutralised many classes of offensive weapon. The defensive firepower of artillery and machine guns dominated the battlefield and the ability of the armies to supply themselves and replace casualties prolonged battles for weeks. Thirty-four German divisions fought in the Flanders battles, against twelve French, nine British and six Belgian divisions, along with marines and dismounted cavalry. Over the winter, Falkenhayn reconsidered Germany strategy because and the imposition of a dictated peace on France and Russia had exceeded German resources. Falkenhayn devised a new strategy to detach either Russia or France from the Allied coalition through diplomacy as well as military action. A strategy of attrition () would make the cost of the war too great for the Allies, until one dropped out and made a separate peace. The remaining belligerents would have to negotiate or face the Germans concentrated on the remaining front, which would be sufficient for Germany to inflict a decisive defeat.
==Background==

===Strategic developments===

====Eastern Front====
On 9 October, the First German offensive against Warsaw began with the battles of Warsaw (9–19 October) and Ivangorod (9–20 October). Four days later, Przemyśl was relieved by the advancing Austro-Hungarians and the Battle of Chyrow began in Galicia. Czernowitz in Bukovina was re-occupied by the Austro-Hungarian army on 22 August and then lost again to the Russian army on 28 October. On 29 October, the Ottoman Empire commenced hostilities against Russia, when Turkish warships bombarded Odessa, Sevastopol and Theodosia. Next day Stanislau in Galicia was taken by Russian forces and the Serbian army began a retreat from the line of the Drina. On 4 November, the Russian army crossed the frontier of Turkey-in-Asia and seized Azap.

Britain and France declared war on Turkey on 5 November and next day, Keupri-Keni in Armenia was captured, during the Bergmann Offensive (2–16 November) by the Russian army. On 10 October, Przemysl was surrounded again by the Russian army, beginning the Second Siege; Memel in East Prussia was occupied by the Russians a day later. Keupri-Keni was recaptured by the Ottoman army on 14 November, the Sultan proclaimed Jihad, next day the Battle of Cracow (15 November – 2 December) began and the Second Russian Invasion of North Hungary (15 November – 12 December) commenced. The Second German Offensive against Warsaw opened with the Battle of Łódź (16 November – 15 December).

====Great Retreat====
The Great Retreat was a long withdrawal by the French and British armies to the Marne, from 24 August to 28 September 1914, after the success of the German armies in the Battle of the Frontiers After the defeat of the French Fifth Army at the Battle of Charleroi (21 August) and the BEF in the Battle of Mons (23 August), both armies made a rapid retreat to avoid envelopment. A counter-offensive by the French and the BEF at the First Battle of Guise failed to end the German advance and the Franco-British retreat continued beyond the Marne. From 5 to 12 September, the First Battle of the Marne ended the retreat and forced the German armies to retire towards the Aisne river, where the First Battle of the Aisne was fought from 13 to 28 September.

===Tactical developments===

====Flanders====

After the retreat of the French Fifth Army and the BEF, local operations took place from August–October. General Fournier was ordered on 25 August to defend the fortress at Maubeuge, which was surrounded two days later by the German VII Reserve Corps. Maubeuge was defended by fourteen forts, a garrison of territorials and British and Belgian stragglers. The fortress blocked the main Cologne–Paris rail line, leaving only the line from Trier to Liège, Brussels, Valenciennes and Cambrai open to the Germans, which was needed to carry supplies southward to the armies on the Aisne and transport troops of the 6th Army northwards from Lorraine to Flanders. On 7 September, the garrison surrendered, after super-heavy artillery from the Siege of Namur demolished the forts. The Germans took and captured Small detachments of the Belgian, French and British armies conducted operations in Belgium and northern France, against German cavalry and Jäger.

On 27 August, a squadron of the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) flew to Ostend, for reconnaissance sorties between Bruges, Ghent and Ypres. Royal Marines landed at Dunkirk on the night of and on 28 September, a battalion occupied Lille. The rest of the brigade occupied Cassel on 30 September and scouted the country in motor cars; an RNAS Armoured Car Section was created, by fitting vehicles with bullet-proof steel. On 2 October, the Marine Brigade was sent to Antwerp, followed by the rest of the 63rd (Royal Naval) Division on 6 October, having landed at Dunkirk on the night of From 6 to 7 October, the 7th Division and the 3rd Cavalry Division landed at Zeebrugge. Naval forces collected at Dover were formed into a separate unit, which became the Dover Patrol, to operate in the Channel and off the French-Belgian coast.

====BEF====
In late September, Marshal Joseph Joffre and Field Marshal John French discussed the transfer of the BEF from the Aisne to Flanders, to unify British forces on the Continent, shorten the British lines of communication from England and to defend Antwerp and the Channel Ports. Despite the inconvenience of British troops crossing French lines of communication, when French forces were moving north after the Battle of the Aisne, Joffre agreed subject to a proviso, that French would make individual British units available for operations as soon as they arrived. On the night of the transfer of the BEF from the Aisne front began in great secrecy. Marches were made at night and billeted troops were forbidden to venture outside in daylight. On 3 October, a German wireless message was intercepted, which showed that the BEF was still believed to be on the Aisne.

II Corps moved from the night of and III Corps followed from 6 October, leaving a brigade behind with I Corps, which stayed until the night of II Corps arrived around Abbeville from 8 to 9 October and concentrated to the north-east around Gennes-Ivergny, Gueschart, Le Boisle and Raye, preparatory to an advance on Béthune. The 2nd Cavalry Division arrived at St Pol and Hesdin on 9 October and the 1st Cavalry Division arrived a day later. GHQ left Fère-en-Tardenois and arrived at Saint-Omer on 13 October. III Corps began to assemble around Saint-Omer and Hazebrouck on 11 October, then moved behind the left flank of II Corps, to advance on Bailleul and Armentières. I Corps arrived at Hazebrouck on 19 October and moved eastwards to Ypres.

====Race to the Sea====

After a tour of the front on 15 September, the new chief of the German General Staff (&quot;Oberste Heeresleitung, OHL&quot;), General Erich von Falkenhayn planned to continue the withdrawal of the right flank of the German armies in France from the Aisne, to gain time for a strategic regrouping, by moving the 6th Army from Lorraine. A decisive result (), was intended to come from the offensive of the 6th Army but on 18 September, French attacks endangered the German northern flank instead and the 6th Army used the first units from Lorraine to repulse the French as a preliminary. The French used undamaged rail and communications networks, to move troops faster than the Germans but neither side could begin a decisive attack, having to send units forward piecemeal, against reciprocal attacks of the opponent, in the Race to the Sea (The name is a misnomer, because neither side raced to the sea but tried to outflank their opponent before they reached it and ran out of room.)

A German attack on 24 September, forced the French onto the defensive and Joffre reinforced the northern flank of the Second Army. As BEF units arrived, operations began piecemeal on the northern flank; the Belgian army refused a request by Joffre to leave the National redoubt of Belgium and sortie against German communications. A Franco-British offensive was substituted towards Lille and Antwerp. The allied troops managed to advance towards Lille and the Lys river but were stopped by German attacks in the opposite direction on 20 October. The &quot;race&quot; ended on the Belgian coast around 17 October, when the last open area from Diksmuide to the North Sea, was occupied by Belgian troops withdrawing from Antwerp after the Siege of Antwerp (28 September – 10 October). The outflanking attempts resulted in indecisive encounter battles through Artois and Flanders, at the Battle of La Bassée the Battle of Messines and the Battle of Armentières 

==Prelude==

===Terrain===
The far north of France and the north-west Belgium are known as Flanders. West of a line between Arras and Calais in the north-west are chalk downlands, covered with soil sufficient for arable farming. East of the line, the land declines in a series of spurs into the Flanders plain, bounded by canals linking Douai, Béthune, Saint-Omer and Calais. To the south-east, canals run between Lens, Lille, Roubaix and Courtrai, the Lys river from Courtrai to Ghent and to the north-west lies the sea. The plain is almost flat, apart from a line of low hills from Cassel, eastwards to Mont des Cats, Mont Noir, Mont Rouge, Scherpenberg and Mont Kemmel. From Kemmel, a low ridge lies to the north-east, declining in elevation past Ypres through Wytschaete (Wijtschate), Gheluvelt and Passchendaele (Passendale), curving north then north-west to Diksmuide where it merges with the plain. A coastal strip is about wide, near sea level and fringed by sand dunes. Inland the ground is mainly meadow, cut by canals, dykes, drainage ditches and roads built up on causeways. The Lys, Yser and upper Scheldt are canalised and between them, the water level underground is close to the surface, rises further in the autumn and fills any dip, the sides of which then collapse. The ground surface quickly turns to a consistency of cream cheese and on the coast movement is confined to roads, except during frosts.

In the rest of the Flanders Plain were woods and small fields, divided by hedgerows planted with trees and fields cultivated from small villages and farms. The terrain was difficult for infantry operations because of the lack of observation, impossible for mounted action because of the many obstructions and awkward for artillery because of the limited view. South of La Bassée Canal around Lens and Béthune was a coal-mining district full of slagheaps, pitheads () and miners&#x27; houses (). North of the canal, the city of Lille, Tourcoing and Roubaix formed a manufacturing complex, with outlying industries at Armentières, Comines, Halluin and Menin (Menen), along the Lys river, with isolated sugar beet and alcohol refineries and a steelworks near Aire-sur-la-Lys. Intervening areas were agricultural, with wide roads, which in France were built on shallow foundations or were unpaved mud tracks. Narrow roads ran along the frontier and inside Belgium. In France, the roads were closed by the local authorities during thaws to preserve the surface and marked by signs, which were ignored by British lorry drivers. The difficulty of movement after the end of summer absorbed much of the labour available on road maintenance, leaving field defences to be built by front-line soldiers.

===Tactics===
In October, Herbert Kitchener, the British Secretary of State for War, forecast a long war and placed orders for the manufacture of a large number of field, medium and heavy guns and howitzers, sufficient to equip a army. The order was soon increased by the War Office but the rate of shell manufacture had an immediate effect on operations. While the BEF was still on the Aisne front, ammunition production for field guns and howitzers was a month and only per month were being manufactured for guns; the War Office sent another guns to France during October. As the contending armies moved north into Flanders, the flat terrain and obstructed view, caused by the number of buildings, industrial concerns, tree foliage and field boundaries, forced changes in British artillery methods. Lack of observation was remedied in part by decentralising artillery to infantry brigades and by locating the guns in the front line but this made them more vulnerable and several batteries were overrun in the fighting between Arras and Ypres. Devolving control of the guns made concentrated artillery-fire difficult to arrange, because of a lack of field telephones and the obscuring of signal flags by mists and fog.

Co-operation with French forces to share the British heavy artillery was implemented and discussions with French gunners led to a synthesis of the French practice of firing a field artillery (squall) before infantry moved to the attack and then ceasing fire, with the British preference for direct fire at observed targets, which was the beginning of the development of creeping barrages. During the advance of the III Corps and an attack on Méteren, the 4th Division issued divisional artillery orders, which stressed the concentration of the fire of the artillery, although during the battle the gunners fired on targets of opportunity, since German positions were so well camouflaged. As the fighting moved north into Belgian Flanders, the artillery found that Shrapnel shells had little effect on buildings and called for high explosive ammunition. During a general attack on 18 October, the German defenders achieved a defensive success, due to the disorganised nature of the British attacks, which only succeeded where close artillery support was available. The unexpected strength of the German 4th Army opposite, compounded British failings, although the partly trained, poorly led and badly equipped German reserve corps suffered high casualties.

German tactics developed during the battles around Ypres, with cavalry still effective during the early manoeuvring, although just as hampered by hedges and fenced fields, railway lines and urban growth as the Allied cavalry, which made the ground far better suited to defensive battle. German accounts stress the accuracy of Allied sniper fire, which led troops to remove the spike from &quot;Pickelhaube&quot; helmets and for officers to carry rifles to be less conspicuous. Artillery remained the main infantry-killer, particularly French 75 mm field guns, firing shrapnel at ranges lower than . Artillery in German reserve units was far less efficient, due to lack of training and shells often fell short. In the lower ground between Ypres and the higher ground to the south-east and east, the ground was drained by many streams and ditches, divided into small fields with high hedges and ditches, roads were unpaved and the area was dotted with houses and farmsteads. Observation was limited by trees and open spaces could be commanded from covered positions and made untenable by small-arms and artillery fire. As winter approached, the views became more open as woods and copses were cut down by artillery bombardments and the ground became much softer, particularly in the lower-lying areas.

===Plans===
The French, Belgian and British forces in Flanders had no organisation for unified command but General Foch had been appointed on 4 October by Joffre. The Belgian army managed to save from Antwerp and retire to the Yser and although not formally in command of British and Belgian forces, Foch obtained co-operation from both contingents. On 10 October, Foch and French agreed to combine French, British and Belgian forces north and east of Lille, from the Lys to the Scheldt. Foch planned a joint advance from Ypres to Nieuwpoort, towards a line from Roeselare (Roulers), Thourout and Gistel, just south of Ostend. Foch intended to isolate the German III Reserve Corps, which was advancing from Antwerp, from the main German force in Flanders. French and Belgian forces were to push the Germans back against the sea, as French and British forces turned south-east and closed up to the Lys river from Menin to Ghent, to cross the river and attack the northern flank of the German armies.

Falkenhayn sent the 4th Army headquarters to Flanders, to take over the III Reserve Corps and its heavy artillery, twenty batteries of heavy field howitzers, twelve batteries of 210 mm howitzers and six batteries of 100 mm guns, after the Siege of Antwerp The XXII, XXIII, XXVI and XXVII Reserve corps, of the six new reserve corps formed from volunteers after the outbreak of the war, were ordered from Germany to join the III Reserve Corps on 8 October. The German reserve corps infantry were poorly trained and ill-equipped but on 10 October, Falkenhayn issued a directive that the 4th Army was to cross the Yser, advance regardless of losses and isolate Dunkirk and Calais, then turn south towards Saint-Omer. With the 6th Army to the south, which was to deny the Allies an opportunity to establish a secure front and transfer troops to the north, the 4th Army was to inflict an annihilating blow on the French, Belgian and BEF forces in French and Belgian Flanders.

===Battle of the Yser===
French, British and Belgian troops covered the Belgian and British withdrawal from Antwerp towards Ypres and the Yser from Diksmuide to Nieuwpoort, on a front. The new German 4th Army was ordered to capture Dunkirk and Calais, by attacking from the coast to the junction with the 6th Army. German attacks began on 18 October, coincident with the battles around Ypres and gained a foothold over the Yser at Tervaete. The French 42nd Division at Nieuwpoort detached a brigade to reinforce the Belgians and German heavy artillery was countered on the coast, by Allied ships under British command, which bombarded German artillery positions and forced the Germans to attack further inland. On 24 October, the Germans attacked fifteen times and managed to cross the Yser on a front. The French sent the rest of the 42nd Division to the centre but on 26 October, the Belgian Commander Félix Wielemans, ordered the Belgian army to retreat, until over-ruled by the Belgian king. Next day sluice gates on the coast at Nieuwpoort were opened, which flooded the area between the Yser and the railway embankment, running north from Diksmuide. On 30 October, German troops crossed the embankment at Ramscapelle (Ramskapelle) but as the waters rose, were forced back the following evening. The floods reduced the fighting to local operations, which diminished until the end of the battle on 30 November.

==Battle==

===Battle of Langemarck===
The Battle of Langemarck took place from 21 to 24 October, after an advance by the German 4th and 6th armies which began on 19 October, as the left flank of the BEF began advancing towards Menin and Roeselare. On 20 October, Langemarck (Langemark), north-east of Ypres, was held by a French territorial unit and the British IV corps to the south. I Corps (Lieutenant-General Douglas Haig) was due to arrive with orders to attack on 21 October. On 21 October, it had been cloudy and attempts to reconnoitre the German positions during the afternoon had not observed any German troops movements; the arrival of four new German reserve corps was discovered by prisoner statements, wireless interception and the increasing power of German attacks; infantry corps were now known to be north of the Lys, along with the four cavalry corps, against British divisions and five allied cavalry divisions. The British attack made early progress but the 4th army began a series of attacks, albeit badly organised and poorly supported. The German 6th and 4th armies attacked from Armentières to Messines and Langemarck. The British IV Corps was attacked around Langemarck, where the 7th Division was able to repulse German attacks and I Corps was able to make a short advance.
Further north, French cavalry was pushed back to the Yser by the XXIII Reserve Corps and by nightfall was dug in from the junction with the British at Steenstraat to the vicinity of Diksmuide, the boundary with the Belgian army. The British closed the gap with a small number of reinforcements and on 23 October, the French IX Corps took over the north end of the Ypres salient, relieving I Corps with the 17th Division. Kortekeer Cabaret was recaptured by the 1st Division and the 2nd Division was relieved. Next day, I Corps had been relieved and the 7th Division lost Polygon Wood temporarily. The left flank of the 7th Division was taken over by the 2nd Division, which joined in the counter-attack of the French IX Corps on the northern flank towards Roeselare and Torhout, as the fighting further north on the Yser impeded German attacks around Ypres. German attacks were made on the right flank of the 7th Division at Gheluvelt. The British sent the remains of I Corps to reinforce IV Corps. German attacks from 25 to 26 October were made further south, against the 7th Division on the Menin Road and on 26 October part of the line crumbled until reserves were scraped up to block the gap and avoid a rout.

===Battle of Gheluvelt===
On 28 October, as the 4th Army attacks bogged down, Falkenhayn responded to the costly failures of the 4th and 6th armies by ordering the armies to conduct holding attacks while a new force, (General Max von Fabeck) was assembled from XV Corps and the II Bavarian Corps, the 26th Division and the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division, under the XIII Corps headquarters. The was rushed up to Deûlémont and Werviq (Wervik), the boundary between the 6th and 4th armies, to attack towards Ypres and Poperinge. Strict economies were imposed on the 6th Army formations further south, to provide artillery ammunition for guns supporting an attack to the north-west, between Gheluvelt and Messines. The XV Corps was to attack on the right flank, south of the Menin–Ypres road to the Comines–Ypres canal and the main effort was to come from there to Garde Dieu by the II Bavarian Corps, flanked by the 26th Division.
On 29 October, attacks by the XXVII Reserve Corps began against I Corps north of the Menin Road, at dawn, in thick fog. By nightfall, the Gheluvelt crossroads had been lost and prisoners taken. French attacks further north, by the 17th Division, 18th Division and 31st Division recaptured Bixschoote and Kortekeer Cabaret. Advances by to the south-west against I Corps and the dismounted Cavalry Corps further south, came to within of Ypres along the Menin road and brought the town into range of German artillery. On 30 October, German attacks by the 54th Reserve Division and the 30th Division, on the left flank of the BEF at Gheluvelt, were repulsed but the British were pushed out of Zandvoorde, Hollebeke and Hollebeke Château as German attacks on a line from Messines to Wytschaete and St Yves were repulsed. The British rallied opposite Zandvoorde with French reinforcements and &quot;Bulfin&#x27;s Force&quot; a command improvised for the motley of troops. The BEF had many casualties and used all its reserves but the French IX Corps sent its last three battalions and retrieved the situation in the I Corps sector. On 31 October, German attacks near Gheluvelt broke through until a counter-attack by the 2nd Worcestershire restored the situation.

===Battle of Nonne Bosschen===
The French XVI Corps reached the area from St Eloi to Wytschaete on 1 November, to reinforce the cavalry Corps and the IX Corps attacked further north near Becelaere (Beselare), which relieved the German pressure on both flanks of I Corps. By 3 November, had lost in five days and of battalions in the BEF which had come to France with about and men each, fewer than of which were under strong, despite receiving replacements up to 28 October. Foch planned an offensive towards Messines and Langemarck for 6 November, to expand the salient around Ypres. The attack was forestalled by German attacks on the flanks from 5 to 9 November. On 9 November, the Germans attacked the French and Belgians between Langemarck and Diksmuide, forcing them back to the Yser, where the Belgians blew the crossings. After a lull, the German attacks resumed in great force from 10 to 11 November, mainly on the 4th Army front from Langemarck to Diksmuide. On 10 November, German divisions of the 4th and 6th Armies, and XXVII Reserve Corps attacked from Nonne Bosschen (Nun&#x27;s Copse) and the edge of Polygon Wood, to Gheluvelt and across the Menin Road to Shrewsbury Forest in the south.

On 11 November, the Germans attacked from Messines to Herenthage, Veldhoek woods, Nonne Bosschen and Polygon Wood. Massed small-arms fire repulsed German attacks between Polygon Wood and Veldhoek. The German 3rd Division and 26th Division broke through to St Eloi and advanced to Zwarteleen, some east of Ypres, where they were checked by the British 7th Cavalry Brigade. The remains of II Corps from La Bassée, held a front, with and against battalions with The British were forced back by the German 4th Division and British counter-attacks were repulsed. Next day, an unprecedented bombardment fell on British positions in the south of the salient between Polygon Wood and Messines. German troops broke through along the Menin road but could not be supported and the advance was contained by 13 November. Both sides were exhausted by these efforts; German casualties around Ypres had reached about and BEF losses, August – 30 November, were Ypres). The Belgian army had been reduced by half and the French had lost by September, having been killed by the end of the year.

===Local operations, 12–22 November===

The weather became much colder, with rain from 12 to 14 November and a little snow on 15 November. Night frosts followed and on 20 November, the ground was covered by snow. Frostbite cases appeared and the physical strain increased, among troops occupying trenches half-full of freezing water, falling asleep standing up and being sniped at and bombed from opposing trenches away. On 12 November, a German attack surprised the French IX Corps and the British 8th Division arrived at the front on 13 November and more attacks were made on the II Corps front from 14 November. Between I Corps was relieved by the French IX and XVI corps and the British line was reorganised. On 16 November, Foch agreed with French to take over the line from Zonnebeke to the Ypres–Comines canal. The new British line ran from Wytschaete to the La Bassée Canal at Givenchy. The Belgians held and the French defended some of the new Western front. On 17 November, Albrecht ordered the 4th Army to cease its attacks; the III Reserve Corps and XIII Corps were ordered to move the Eastern Front, which was discovered by the Allies on 20 November.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===

Both sides had tried to advance after the &quot;open&quot; northern flank had disappeared, the Franco-British towards Lille in October, followed by attacks by the BEF, Belgians and a new French Eighth Army in Belgium. The German 4th and 6th armies took small amounts of ground at great cost to both sides, at the Battle of the Yser and further south at the Battles of Ypres. Falkenhayn then tried a limited goal of capturing Ypres and Mont Kemmel, from 19 October to 22 November. By 8 November, Falkenhayn had accepted that the coastal advance had failed and that taking Ypres was impossible. Neither side had moved forces to Flanders fast enough to obtain a decisive victory and both were exhausted, short of ammunition and suffering from collapses in morale, with some infantry units refusing orders. The autumn battles in Flanders had quickly become static, attrition operations, unlike the battles of manoeuvre in the summer. French, British and Belgian troops in improvised field defences repulsed German attacks for four weeks in mutually costly attacks and counter-attacks. From 21 to 23 October, German reservists had made mass attacks at Langemarck, with losses of up to seventy per cent.

Industrial warfare between mass armies had been indecisive; troops could only move forward over heaps of dead. Field fortifications had neutralised many classes of offensive weapon and the defensive firepower of artillery and machine-guns had dominated the battlefield; the ability of the armies to supply themselves and replace casualties kept battles going for weeks. The German armies engaged in the Flanders battles, the French twelve, the British nine and the Belgians six, along with marines and dismounted cavalry. Falkenhayn reconsidered German strategy; and a dictated peace against France and Russia had been shown to be beyond German resources. Falkenhayn intended to detach Russia or France from the Allied coalition, by diplomatic as well as military action. A strategy of attrition (), would make the cost of the war was too great for the Allies to bear, until one enemy negotiated an end to the war. The remaining belligerents would have to come to terms or face the German army concentrated on the remaining front and capable of obtaining a decisive victory.

====Mad minute====
In 2010, Jack Sheldon wrote that a &quot;mad minute&quot; of accurate rapid rifle-fire, was held to have persuaded German troops that they were opposed by machine-guns. This was a &quot;false notion&quot;, picked out of a translation of (1918), which the official historians used, in lieu of authoritative sources, during the writing of the 1914 volumes of the British &quot;History of the Great War&quot;, the first editions of which were published in 1922 and 1925.

Sheldon wrote that the translation was inaccurate and ignored many references to the combined fire of rifles and machine-guns,

The British fired short bursts at close range, to conserve ammunition. Sheldon also wrote that German troops knew the firing characteristics of machine-guns and kept still until French Hotchkiss M1909 and Hotchkiss M1914 machine-guns, which had ammunition in strips, were reloading.

Sheldon wrote that a German description of the fate of the new reserve corps as a (massacre of the innocents), in a communiqué of 11 November 1914, was misleading. Claims that up to of the manpower of the reserve corps were student volunteers, who attacked while singing &quot;Deutschland über alles&quot; began a myth. After the war, most regiments which had fought in Flanders, referred to the singing of songs on the battlefield, a practice only plausible when used to identify units at night. In 1986, Unruh, wrote that had been enrolled in six reserve corps, four of which had been sent to Flanders, leaving a maximum of of the reserve corps operating in Flanders made up of volunteers. Only of German casualties at Ypres were young and inexperienced student reservists, others being active soldiers, older members of the &quot;Landwehr&quot; and army reservists. Reserve Infantry Regiment 211 had in active service, of the reserve, which was composed of former soldiers from 23 to 28 years old, who were inexperienced and probably 18 to 20 years old, (former soldiers from 28 to 39 years old, released from the reserve) and one (enrolled but inexperienced).

===Casualties===

In 1925, the British official historian, James Edmonds, recorded that the Belgians had suffered a great number of casualties from 15 to 25 October, including British casualties from 14 October to 30 November were casualties were and of casualties in Belgium and northern France, from 15 October to 24 November, were incurred on the front from the Lys to Gheluvelt, from 30 October to 24 November. In 2003, Ian Beckett recorded casualties, casualties, losses and casualties. In 2010, Jack Sheldon recorded casualties, casualties, that the French had many losses and that the Belgian army had been reduced to a shadow. Sheldon also noted that Colonel Fritz von Lossberg had recorded that up to 3 November, casualties in the 4th Army were and that the 6th Army had suffered of which had occurred in from 30 October to 3 November.

===Subsequent operations===

Winter operations from November 1914 to February 1915 in the Ypres area, took place in the Attack on Wytschaete (14 December). A reorganisation of the defence of Flanders had been carried out by the Franco-British from 15 to 22 November, which left the BEF holding a homogeneous front from Givenchy to Wytschaete to the north. Joffre arranged for a series of attacks on the Western Front, after receiving information that German divisions were moving to the Russian Front. The Eighth Army was ordered to attack in Flanders and French was asked to participate with the BEF on 14 December. Joffre wanted the British to attack along all of the BEF front and especially from Warneton to Messines, as the French attacked from Wytschaete to Hollebeke. French gave orders to attack from the Lys to Warneton and Hollebeke with II and III Corps, as IV and Indian corps conducted local operations, to fix the Germans to their front.

French emphasised that the attack would begin on the left flank, next to the French and that units must not move ahead of each other. The French and the 3rd Division were to capture Wytschaete and Petit Bois, then Spanbroekmolen was to be taken by II Corps attacking from the west and III Corps from the south, only the 3rd Division making a maximum effort. On the right the 5th Division was only to pretend to attack and III Corps was to make demonstrations, as the corps was holding a front and could do no more. On the left, the French XVI Corps failed to reach its objectives and the 3rd Division got to within of the German line and found uncut wire. One battalion took of the German front trench and took The failure of the attack on Wytschaete resulted in the attack further south being cancelled but German artillery retaliation was much heavier than the British bombardment.

Desultory attacks were made from 15 to 16 December which, against intact German defences and deep mud, made no impression. On 17 December, XVI and II corps did not attack, the French IX Corps sapped forward a short distance down the Menin road and small gains were made at Klein Zillebeke and Bixschoote. Joffre ended attacks in the north, except for operations at Arras and requested support from French who ordered attacks on 18 December along the British front, then restricted the attacks to support of XVI Corps by II Corps and demonstrations by II Corps and the Indian Corps. Fog impeded the Arras attack and a German counter-attack against XVI Corps led II Corps to cancel its supporting attack. Six small attacks were made by the 8th, 7th, 4th and Indian divisions, which captured little ground, all of which was found to be untenable due to mud and water-logging; Franco-British attacks in Flanders ended.

<text>David of Scotland (1152 – 17 June 1219) was a Scottish prince and Earl of Huntingdon. He was the grandson of David I and the younger brother of two Scottish kings, Malcolm the Maiden and William the Lion.

==Life==
Born in 1152, David was the youngest surviving son of Henry of Scotland, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon and Ada de Warenne, a daughter of William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey, and Elizabeth of Vermandois. His paternal grandfather was David I of Scotland. Huntingdon was granted to him after his elder brother William I of Scotland ascended the throne. David&#x27;s son John succeeded him to the earldom.

In 1190 his brother gave him &#x27;superiority&#x27; over Dundee and its port. The same year he endowed Lindores Abbey in Fife and a church dedicated to St Mary in Dundee.

In the litigation for succession to the crown of Scotland in 1290–1292, the great-great-grandson Floris V, Count of Holland of David&#x27;s sister, Ada, claimed that David had renounced his hereditary rights to the throne of Scotland. He therefore declared that his claim to the throne had priority over David&#x27;s descendants. However, no explanation or firm evidence for the supposed renunciation could be provided.

==Marriage and issue==
On 26 August 1190, David married Matilda of Chester (1171 – 6 January 1233), daughter of Hugh de Kevelioc, 3rd Earl of Chester, and wife Bertrade de Montfort. He was almost twenty years Matilda&#x27;s senior. The marriage was recorded by Benedict of Peterborough.

David and Matilda had:

1. Margaret of Huntingdon (c. 1194 – c. 1228), married Alan, Lord of Galloway, by whom she had two daughters, including Dervorguilla of Galloway.

2. Robert of Huntingdon (died young)

3. Ada of Huntingdon, married Sir Henry de Hastings, by whom she had one son, Henry de Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings.

4. Matilda (Maud) of Huntingdon (-aft.1219, unmarried)

5. Isobel of Huntingdon (1199–1251), married firstly, Henry de Percy and had issue and secondly, Robert Bruce, 4th Lord of Annandale, by whom she had two sons, including Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale.

6. John of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon (1207 – 6 June 1237), married Elen ferch Llywelyn. He succeeded his uncle Ranulf as Earl of Chester in 1232, but died childless.

7. Henry of Huntingdon (died young)

Earl David also had three illegitimate children:

# Henry of Stirling
# Henry of Brechin
#Ada, married Malise, son of Ferchar, Earl of Strathearn

After the extinction of the senior line of the Scottish royal house in 1290, when the legitimate line of William the Lion of Scotland ended, David&#x27;s descendants were the prime candidates for the throne. The two most notable claimants to the throne, Robert Bruce, 5th Lord of Annandale (grandfather of King Robert I of Scotland) and John Balliol were his descendants through David&#x27;s daughters Isobel and Margaret, respectively.

==In popular culture==

Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s 1825 novel &quot;The Talisman&quot; features Earl David in his capacity as a prince of Scotland as a crusader on the Third Crusade. For the majority of the novel, Earl David operates under an alias: Sir Kenneth of the Couchant Leopard. Earl David&#x27;s adventures are highly fictionalized for this novel.

<text>USS &quot;Charles R. Ware&quot; (DD-865), was a of the United States Navy in service from 1945 to 1974. After her decommissioning, she was sunk as a target in 1981.

==Namesake==

Charles Rollins Ware was born on 11 March 1911 in Knoxville, Tennessee. He enlisted in the United States Navy on 14 June 1929, and in 1930 was appointed to the United States Naval Academy. After graduation in 1934, Ware served on the battleship and the destroyer until February 1940, when he entered flight training at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida.

Serving as a Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bomber pilot with Scouting Squadron 6 (VS-6) based on the aircraft carrier , Lieutenant Ware and his division of six SBDs attacked the carrier &quot;Kaga&quot; on 4 June 1942, one of four Japanese carriers sunk in the Battle of Midway. During their return to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; they successfully fought off attacks by Japanese fighters, but ran out of fuel and were forced to ditch. One crew was rescued and another crew was picked up by a Japanese destroyer and later executed. Ware and the other SBD crewmen were reported missing in action. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross.

The planned destroyer escort USS &quot;Charles R. Ware&quot; (DE-547) was named for him, but its construction was cancelled in 1944 before construction could begin.

==Construction==
&quot;Charles R. Ware&quot; was laid down by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation at Staten Island in New York on 1 November 1944, launched on 12 April 1945 by Mrs. Z. Ware and commissioned on 21 July 1945.

==Operational history==
From her home ports at Norfolk, Virginia, and after December 1950, Newport, Rhode Island, &quot;Charles R. Ware&quot; operated through 1960 with the Atlantic Fleet. Along with many deployments to the Mediterranean Sea and northern Europe, she carried out training and overhaul necessary. Her first major cruise, between 1 March and 9 April 1946, was to northern waters, where she aided in developing techniques for cold weather operations, crossing the Arctic Circle.

Shortly thereafter, she served as target ship for submarines training off New London, Connecticut. On 10 November 1947 the ship got underway for the Mediterranean, and her first tour of duty with the 6th Fleet. After exercising with this force, and calling at ports of northern Europe, she returned to Norfolk 11 March 1948. Her next tour of duty in the Mediterranean came in 1949, during which for 2 weeks she patrolled off the Levant Coast under the direction of the United Nations&#x27; Palestine Truce Commission.

Through two cruises to the Caribbean in the summer of 1949, &quot;Charles R. Ware&quot; aided in the training of members of the Naval Reserve, then took part in a large-scale Arctic operation before preparing for a 1950 tour with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. Her 1951 tour was highlighted by operations with ships of the Royal Hellenic Navy. Following her 1953 tour, she conducted antisubmarine warfare exercises with British ships off Northern Ireland, calling then at ports in Ireland, Germany, Norway, Denmark, and Belgium. Later that year she took part in exercises with the aircraft carrier off Narragansett Bay.

Early in 1954, she returned to the Mediterranean once more, for a tour of duty which included participation in a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) operation. Her 1955 deployment began with antisubmarine warfare exercises with the Royal Navy off Northern Ireland, and was followed by her 6th Fleet duty. In summer 1956, she carried midshipmen on a summer training cruise to Northern Europe.

The year 1957 was marked by assignment to escort the ship carrying King Saud of Saudi Arabia into New York harbor for his state visit, and a European cruise during which she exercised with Spanish destroyers. That fall, she put to sea for North Atlantic Treaty Organization exercises and on 20 January 1958, she rescued a downed pilot from the aircraft carrier while conducting air operations off the east coast. Shortly thereafter she cleared for the Mediterranean once more.

During the summer of 1959, &quot;Charles R. Ware&quot; took part in the historic Operation Inland Seas, the first passage of a naval force through the Saint Lawrence Seaway into the Great Lakes. She took part in the Naval Review in Lake Saint Louis on 26 June, which was taken by Queen Elizabeth II and President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and sailed on to call at a number of United States and Canadian ports. During her 1960 Mediterranean tour, she carried German naval observers during an exercise in the Ionian Sea.

&quot;Charles R. Ware&quot; was decommissioned on 12 December 1974 and was sunk as a target in the Caribbean on 15 November 1981.

<text>Albert Allison Dysart (March 22, 1880 – December 8, 1962) was a New Brunswick politician, lawyer and judge.

== Life ==
Dysart was born in Cocagne, New Brunswick and had an ancestry of Scottish and English Loyalist. Initially having an interest in farming, he graduated from the University of St. Joseph&#x27;s College in Memramcook where he got a Master of Arts, and received further education at the Ontario Agricultural College. Years later, Dysart would enter Dalhousie Law School and in 1914 he was called to the bar, setting up practice in Bouctouche. He was elected to the provincial legislature in 1917 and served as Speaker from 1921 to 1925 and served briefly as Minister of Lands and Mines in 1925 until the defeat of the Liberal government.

In 1926, Dysart succeeded Peter J. Veniot as leader of the Liberal party. In 1935 the Liberals returned to power and Dysart became the 22nd premier of New Brunswick. Dysart also served as his own Minister of Public Works from 1935 to 1938, and Chairman of the New Brunswick Electric Power Commission, from 1938 until his retirement from politics. His government introduced the first &quot;Landlord and Tenants Act&quot; in 1938 and updated the &quot;Labour Relations Act&quot;. It attempted to create jobs in the Great Depression through extensive road construction. After suffering from poor health from some time, he led the government to re-election in 1939 and resigned in 1940 to become a County Court Judge of Westmorland and Kent Counties. He served in that position until his retirement in 1955.

His former home in Shediac, New Brunswick is a registered historic place. He lived there from 1943 until his death.

<doc id="545485" wikidata="Q255221" url="?curid=545485" title="Táhirih">
<text>Táhirih (Ṭāhira) (, &quot;The Pure One,&quot; also called Qurrat al-ʿAyn ( &quot;Solace/Consolation of the Eyes&quot;) are both titles of Fatimah Baraghani/Umm-i Salmih (1814 or 1817 – August 16–27, 1852), an influential poet, women&#x27;s rights activist and theologian of the Bábí faith in Iran. She was one of the Letters of the Living, the first group of followers of the Báb. Her life, influence and execution made her a key figure of the religion. The daughter of Muhammad Salih Baraghani, she was born into one of the most prominent families of her time. Táhirih led a radical interpretation that, though it split the Babi community, wedded messianism with Bábism.

As a young girl she was educated privately by her father and showed herself a talented writer. Whilst in her teens she married the son of her uncle, with whom she had a difficult marriage. In the early 1840s she became a follower of Shaykh Ahmad and began a secret correspondence with his successor Kazim Rashti. Táhirih travelled to the Shiʻi holy city of Karbala to meet Kazim Rashti, but he died a number of days before her arrival. In 1844 aged about 27, in search of the Qa&#x27;im through the Islamic teachings she figured his whereabouts. Independent to any individual she became acquainted with the teachings of the Báb and accepted his religious claims as Qa&#x27;im. She soon won renown and infamy for her zealous teachings of his faith and &quot;fearless devotion&quot;. Subsequently, exiled back to Iran, Táhirih taught her faith at almost every opportunity. The Persian clergy grew resentful of her and she was detained several times. Throughout her life she battled with her family, who wanted her to return to their traditional beliefs.

Táhirih was probably best remembered for unveiling herself in an assemblage of men during the Conference of Badasht. The unveiling caused much controversy, but Baháʼu&#x27;lláh named her Tahirih &quot;the Pure One&quot; at that same Conference. After the historic Conference of Badasht, a number of those who attended were so amazed at the fearlessness and outspoken language of that heroine, that they felt it their duty to acquaint the Báb with the character of her startling and unprecedented behaviour. They strove to tarnish the purity of her name. To their accusations the Bab replied: &quot;What am I to say regarding her whom the Tongue of Power and Glory has named Tahirih [the Pure One]?&quot; These words proved sufficient to silence those who had endeavoured to undermine her position. From that time onwards she was designated by the believers as Tahirih. The Báb continued to highly praise Táhirih and in one of his later writings equates Táhirih&#x27;s station as equal to that of the seventeen other male &#x27;Letters of the Living&#x27; combined. She was soon arrested and placed under house arrest in Tehran. In mid-1852 she was executed in secret on account of her Bábí faith and her unveiling. Before her death she declared: &quot;You can kill me as soon as you like, but you cannot stop the emancipation of women.&quot; Since her death, Bábí and Baháʼí literature venerated her to the level of martyr, being described as &quot;the first woman suffrage martyr&quot;. As a prominent Bábí (she was the seventeenth disciple or &quot;Letter of the Living&quot; of the Báb) she is highly regarded by followers of the Baháʼí Faith and Azalis and often mentioned in Baháʼí literature as an example of courage in the struggle for women&#x27;s rights. Her date of birth is uncertain as birth records were destroyed at her execution.

== Early life (birth–1844) ==

Táhirih was born Fātemeh Baraghāni in Qazvin, Iran (near Tehran), the oldest of four daughters of Muhammad Salih Baraghani, an Usuli mujtahid who was remembered for his interpretations of the Quran, his eulogies of the tragedies of Karbala, his zeal for the execution of punishments, and his active opposition to the consumption of wine. Her mother was from a Persian noble family, whose brother was the imam of the Shah Mosque of Qazvin. Her mother as well as Táhirih and all her sisters all studied in the Salehiyya, the Salehi madrasa her father had established in 1817, which included a women&#x27;s section. Táhirih&#x27;s uncle, Mohammad Taqi Baraghani, was also a mujtahid whose power and influence dominated the court of Fath-Ali Shah Qajar. The lack of contemporary evidence makes it impossible to determine her exact date of birth. Historian and contemporary Nabíl-i-Aʻzam cites that it was in 1817, whilst others claim an earlier date of 1814. Her grandson suggests a much later date of 1819, whilst some modern historians claim she was born about 1815. Shoghi Effendi and William Sears suggest the date of 1817, and other writers agree. This is supported by claims by a chronicler from the 19th century, who wrote that Táhirih was &quot;thirty-six years of age&quot; when she was killed, in accordance to the lunar calendar. After interviewing Táhirih&#x27;s family and the families of contemporaries as well as reading documents about her life Martha Root believed that the most accurate date of birth was between 1817 and 1819. These findings are contested in several books and articles, but the evidence does not conclusively support either date.

The Baraghani brothers had migrated from an obscure village near Qazvin to the city where they made their fortunes in ecclesiastical schools. They soon rose to the ranks of high-ranking clerics in the court of the Shah of Persia and even running religious sections of Qazvin. The brothers also involved themselves in the mercantile business accumulating great wealth and royal favour. Her father was himself a noted and respected cleric, as was her older uncle who married a daughter of the monarch. Táhirih&#x27;s two younger uncles were not as elevated as the older ones but still had reasonable power in the court. Her aunt was a renowned poet and calligrapher in royal circles and wrote government decrees in her &quot;beautiful hand&quot;. At the time of her birth, the Baraghani&#x27;s were one of the most respected and powerful families in Persia.

=== Education ===

Táhirih was educated particularly well for a girl of her era. A literate woman was itself a rare phenomenon and surprisingly her father decided to break from protocol and personally tutor his daughter. Though still living in a strict religious home, Táhirih was educated in theology, jurisprudence, Persian literature, and poetry. She was allowed to undertake Islamic studies, and was known for her ability to memorize the Qurʼan as well as being able to grasp hard to understand points of religious law. Her father was reported to have lamented at the fact that she was not a son. Táhirih was said to have surpassed her father&#x27;s male students which further convinced him of her literary talents. Her father even allowed her to listen to his lessons which he gave male pupils, on the condition that she hide behind a curtain and not let anybody know her presence. Her father affectionately knew her as &quot;Zarrín Táj&quot; (&quot;Crown of Gold&quot;).

Under the education of her father and uncle, the young Táhirih was able to grasp a better understanding of theological and educational matters compared to her contemporaries. Girls were expected to remain docile and reticent and many were reluctant to allow their daughters to pursue an education of some sort. Her father Muhammad-Salih Baraghani was a writer in his own right and his writings laud the martyrdom of the Muhammad&#x27;s grandson and third Imam Husayn ibn Ali and discuss Persian literature. He was reported to devote much of his time to scholarship rather than involving himself in the court, unlike his elder brother. Amanat cites that Táhirih was also known for her esoteric interpretation of Quranic verses. Táhirih&#x27;s education in Qazvin proved itself in later years, inspiring many new trends among women in her social-circle and may have been instrumental in pressing Táhirih towards the more radical Shaykhi and Bábí teachings. Author Christopher De Bellaigue describes her as &#x27;Simone de Beauvoir meets Joan of Arc&#x27; for being both a feminist and a saint.

Táhrih exerted a powerful charm and charisma on those who met her, and she was generally praised for her beauty. Contemporaries and modern historians comment on Táhirih&#x27;s rare physical beauty. A courtier described her as &quot;moonfaced&quot;, &quot;with hair like musk&quot; whilst one of her fathers pupils wondered how a woman of her beauty could be so intelligent. Historian Nabíl-i-Aʻzam reports the &quot;highest terms of [her] beauty&quot;, George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston, wrote, &quot;beauty and the female sex also lent their consecration to the new creed and the heroism… the lovely but ill-fated poetess of Qazvín&quot;. British Professor Edward Granville Browne who spoke to a great number of her contemporaries, wrote that she was renowned for her &quot;marvellous beauty&quot;. The Shah&#x27;s Austrian physician, Jakob Eduard Polak, also cited her beauty. ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá and Bahíyyih Khánum noted her beauty in several talks and writings. Táhirih&#x27;s education with her father lead her to become a devoutly religious and she upheld these beliefs for the rest of her life. It also made her hungry for knowledge and she busied herself with reading and writing religious and other forms of literature. Her formal education ended when she was about thirteen or fourteen, when she was summoned by her father to consent to a betrothal arranged by her uncle and father.

=== Marriage and developments ===
Though showing herself a capable writer and poet, Táhirih was forced to comply with family pressure and at the age of fourteen she was married to her cousin Muhammad Baraghani the son of her uncle. The marriage resulted in three children, two sons: Ibrahim and Ismaʻil and one daughter. The marriage however, was an unhappy one from the start and Muhammad Baraghani seemed to have been reluctant to allow his wife to further her literary pursuits. In Qazvin Táhirih reportedly won renown for her beauty and respect for her knowledge, however the latter was a quality regarded as undesirable in a daughter and wife. Her husband eventually became the leader of the Friday prayers. Her two sons fled from their father after their mother&#x27;s death to Najaf and Tehran whilst the daughter died shortly after her mother&#x27;s passing. It was in the home of her cousin that Táhirih first became acquainted with and started correspondence with leaders of the Shaykhi movement, including Kazim Rashti, which flourished in the Shiʻi shrine cities in Iraq.
Táhirih was introduced to the radical new Shaykhi teachings in the library of her cousin, Javad Valiyani. At first Valiyani was reluctant to allow his cousin to read the literature, citing the fact her father and uncle were great enemies of the movement. Táhirih however was greatly attracted to the teachings, and was in regular correspondence with Siyyid Kazim, whom she regularly wrote asking theological questions. Siyyid Kazim was gratified with her devotion and pleased that he had another supporter amongst the powerful Baraghani family. He wrote to her describing her as his &quot;Solace of the Eyes&quot;(&quot;Qurat-ul-Ayn&quot;) and &quot;the soul of my heart&quot;. Initially Táhirih kept her new religious beliefs secret from her family. However, with her newfound faith Táhirih found it difficult to comply with her family&#x27;s rigid religious doctrine and began openly battling with them. The religious tension resulted in Táhirih imploring her father, uncle and husband to allow her to make a pilgrimage to the holy shrines of Karbala. At the age of about 26 in 1843, Táhirih separated from her husband and accompanied by her sister made a sojourn to Karbala. Her real motive for the pilgrimage however was to meet her teacher, Kazim Rashti. To her dismay, by the time she had arrived, Kazim had died. With his widow&#x27;s approval, she set up in Siyyid Kazim&#x27;s house and continued teaching his followers from behind a curtain.

In Karbala, Táhirih was a now teaching the pupils of Kazim Rashti. His widow had allowed her to gain access to much of his unpublished works, and Táhirih made a bond with other women of his household. She was however forced to follow protocol and taught her pupils from behind a curtain, as it was regarded as unbecoming for a woman&#x27;s face to be seen in public. It was equally considered unsuitable for a woman to be in the presence of men let alone teach, and it caused much controversy in Karbala. She did nevertheless gain a wide and popular following including many women such as Kurshid Bagum (the future wife of the Núrayn-i-Nayyirayn) and the sister of Mullá Husayn. Another notable follower was the mother of Kázim-i-Samandar. Her teaching was received negatively by the male clergy and other male Shaykhis forced her to retreat to Kadhimiya for a short period.

=== Conversion ===
In 1844, she, through correspondence, found and accepted ʻAli Muhammad of Shiraz (known as the Báb) as the Mahdi. She became the seventeenth disciple or &quot;The Letter of the Living&quot; of the Báb, and rapidly become known as one of his most renowned followers. Táhirih asked the husband of her sister to send the Báb a message saying: &quot;&quot;The effulgence of Thy face flashed forth, and the rays of Thy visage arose on high. Then speak the word, &quot;Am I not your Lord?&quot; and &#x27;Thou art, Thou art!&#x27; we will all reply&quot;.&quot; As the only woman in this initial group of disciples, she is often compared to Mary Magdalene who, in turn, is likewise often considered to be a Christian antecedent of Tahirih. Unlike the other Letters of the Living, Táhirih never met the Báb. Continuing to reside in Siyyid Kazim&#x27;s home, she started to promulgate the new religion of the Báb, Bábism, and attracted many Shakhis to Karbala.

== As a Bábí (1844–1848) ==
While in Karbala in Iraq, Táhirih continued teaching her new faith. After some of the Shiʻa clergy complained, the government moved her to Baghdad, where she resided at the home of the mufti of Baghdad, Shaykh Mahmud Alusi, who was impressed by her devotion and intellect. Táhirih was stoned as she left for Baghdad. There she started giving public statements teaching the new faith, and challenging and debating issues with the Shiʻa clergy. Táhirih&#x27;s behaviour was regarded as unbecoming of a woman especially because of her family background and she was received negatively by the clergy. Despite this, many women admired her lessons and she gained a great number of women followers. At some point the authorities in Baghdad argued with the governor that since Táhirih was Persian she should instead be arguing her case in Iran, and in 1847, on instructions from the Ottoman authorities she, along with a number other Bábís, was deported to the Persian border. A reason may have been her increasing note of innovation in religious matters – in his early teachings, the Báb stressed the necessity for his followers to observe the Islamic Sharia, even to perform acts of supererogatory piety.Táhirih seems to have made this link before the Bāb himself but she received letters supporting her approach soon.

American Martha Root writes about Táhirih: &quot;Picture in your mind one of the most beautiful young women in Iran, a genius, a poet, the
most learned scholar of the Quran and the traditions; think of her as the daughter of a jurist family of letters, daughter of the greatest high priest of her province and very rich, enjoying high rank, living in an artistic palace, and distinguished among her...friends for her boundless, immeasurable courage. Picture what it must mean for a young woman like this, still in her twenties, to arise as the first woman disciple of [the Báb]&quot;.

=== Poetry ===
After her conversion to the Bábí faith, the poems of Táhirih flourished. In most she talks about her longing to meet the Báb. Her poetry illustrates an impressive knowledge of Persian and Arabic literature which Táhirih possessed, seldom seen in a woman in mid-nineteenth century Iran. One of the most famous poems attributed to her is named &quot;Point by Point&quot;. Although it is widely considered her signature poem and a masterpiece, it has been claimed by Mohit Tabátabá&#x27;i to be older and by someone else – though in making this claim he offered no proof and any argument to the contrary is not possible in Iran. When Táhirih was killed, hostile family members suppressed or destroyed her remaining poems, whilst her others were spread across Iran. It has been suggested that Táhirih had little interest in putting her poems in print. ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá recalls that when he was aged five Táhirih would chant her poetry to him in her beautiful voice. Edward Granville Browne procured her poems from Bábí, Baháʼí and Azali sources and published them in his book &quot;A Year Amongst the Persians&quot;.

After collecting, translating, and publishing a volume of those poems commonly considered as having been written by Táhirih,&quot;The Poetry of Táhirih (2002)&quot;, scholars John S. Hatcher and Amrollah Hemmat received a photocopy of two handwritten manuscripts from Bíjan Beidáíe, son of renowned scholar Dhuká&#x27;í Beidáíe who had originally submitted this manuscript to the Baháʼí archives of Iran. The result of this propitious find of poems previously unpublished, untranslated, and largely unknown, was the publication of two volumes by Hatcher and Hemmat containing both translation of the poetry into English and copies of the original calligraphy. The first volume &quot;Adam&#x27;s Wish&quot; (2008) includes a lengthy poem called &quot;Adam&#x27;s Wish&quot;, about the desire of Adam and all other past prophets to witness humanity&#x27;s coming of age. The second volume &quot;The Quickening&quot; was published in 2011 and also includes copies of the original calligraphy of the second manuscript. As Hatcher and Hemmat explain in the introductions to these two volumes, some scholars question whether or not all the poems in the manuscript are by Táhirih. Dhuká&#x27;í Beidáíe himself states in Persian on page 256 of &quot;Adam&#x27;s Wish&quot; that some of the poems may be written by Bihjat (Karím Khan-i-Máftí), one of the Báb&#x27;ís of Qazvin who corresponded with Táhirih through exchanges of poems, possibly during the period when she was imprisoned the house of the governor of Tehran in the period prior to her execution. In 2020 Yet another manuscript of untranslated and unpublished poetry was discovered by Hatcher and Hemmat that had been moved from Iran to the Research Department of the Bahá&#x27;í World Center shortly before the 1979 Revolution. Using the same format as their previous translated works of Táhirih, Hatcher and Hemmat translated the seventy-five poems into English verse and included the original text together with a glossary and extensive notes. Published in 2024 by the Bahá&#x27;í Publishing Trust, this work is titled &quot;Sparks of Fire: Unknown Poetry of Táhirih.&quot;

=== Return to Iran ===
During her journey back to Qazvin, she openly taught the Bábí faith, including on stops in Kirand and Kermanshah, where she debated with the leading cleric of the town, Aqa ʻAbdu&#x27;llah-i-Bihbihani. Aqa ʻAbdu&#x27;llah-i-Bihbihani, at this point, wrote to Táhirih&#x27;s father asking his relatives to remove her from Kermanshah. She then travelled to the small town of Sahneh and then to Hamadan, where she met her brothers who had been sent to ask for her return to Qazvin. She agreed to return with her brothers after making a public statement in Hamedan regarding the Báb. Her father and uncle were particularly distressed at Táhirih&#x27;s behaviour regarding it as bringing the Baraghani family to disgrace. Upon returning to Qazvin in July 1847 she refused to live with her husband whom she considered an infidel, and instead stayed with her brother.

=== Arriving in Qazvin and escape to Tehran ===
After arriving at the family home, her uncle and father endeavoured to convert her away from the Bábí faith, but Táhirih argued and presented religious &quot;proofs&quot; for the validity of the Báb&#x27;s claims. A few weeks later her husband quickly divorced her, and her uncle Muhammad Taqi Baraghani began publicly denouncing his niece. This was very controversial in Qazvin and further undermined the Baraghani family. Rumours circulated in the court of Táhirih&#x27;s immorality, but these were most likely hearsay concocted to undermine her position and ruin her reputation. A Qajar chronicler wrote that he was stunned by her beauty describing her &quot;body like a peacock of Paradise&quot;, and that she had nine husbands (later changed to ninety). He also wrote she engaged in deviant behaviour with &quot;wandering Bábís&quot;.

Such rumours were damaging to the Baraghani families reputation and Táhirih wrote a letter to her father claiming they were merely lies.
To her father she alludes to &quot;&quot;slanderous defamation&quot; and denies &quot;worldly love&quot;&quot;. Her father was reportedly convinced about his daughter&#x27;s chastity. He remained constantly devoted to the memory of her. After the slander and abuse from the clergy in Qazvin he retired to Karbala, where he died in 1866. Her father may have remained unconvinced about the rumours but her uncle Mulla Muhammad Taqi Baraghani was horrified and resentful to the Báb, whom he blamed for having brought his family to ill repute.

While she was in Qazvin, her uncle, Mulla Muhammad Taqi Baraghani, a prominent Mujtahid who was known for his anti-Shaykhi and anti-Bábi stance, was murdered by a young Shaykhi, and the blame for this placed on her by her husband, even though she denied any involvement. During Táhirih&#x27;s stay in Qazvin, Baraghani had embarked on a series of sermons in which he attacked the Báb and his followers. There is no hard evidence as to the identity of the murderer, nor any proof as to Táhirih&#x27;s involvement or lack of it. With her arrest Táhirih&#x27;s powerful father convinced the authorities that rather than kill Táhirih, she would be imprisoned in her home. Táhirih&#x27;s father kept her under house-arrest in his cellar, appointing her maids to act as spies. Though interpreted as a cruel act in Root&#x27;s interviews with family members of Táhirih one claimed this was done out of genuine fear for her safety. Her father was convinced of his daughters&#x27; innocence, but her husband was violently against her. He argued that Táhirih be put on trial for the murder of her uncle. Her father positively refused citing Táhirih would never leave her home. Nevertheless, authorities forcefully arrested Táhirih and one of her maids in the hope that she would testify against her.

In her trial, Táhirih was questioned hour after hour about the murder of her uncle, in which she denied any involvement. To exert pressure on her, Táhirih was threatened to be branded as was her maid who was almost tortured to procure evidence from Táhirih. However, it fell through after the confession of the murderer himself. Táhirih returned to her father&#x27;s home, still a prisoner, and was kept under close watch.
This accusation led to her life being in danger, and through the help of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, she escaped to Tehran. Táhirih stayed at the home of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh in the private parlour of his wife Ásíyih Khánum. Ásíyih personally looked after Táhirih whilst she was hiding in their house. It was there that she first met ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá and grew very attached the boy of about three or four. Táhirih asked Baháʼu&#x27;lláh if she could go to Māku as a pilgrim to see the Báb, who was then still a prisoner, but Baháʼu&#x27;lláh explained the impossibility of the trek.

=== Conference of Badasht ===
In June–July 1848, a number of Bábí leaders met in the hamlet of Badasht at a conference, organized in part and financed by Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, that set in motion the public existence and promulgation of the Bábí movement.

In one account, the purpose of the conference was to initiate a complete break in the Babi community with the Islamic past. The same account notes that a secondary account was to find a way to free the Bab from the prison of Chiriq,
and it was Tahirih who pushed the notion that there should be an armed rebellion to save the Bab and create the break. Another source states that there was no doubt that prominent Babi leaders wanted to plan an armed revolt. It seems that much of what Tahirih was pushing was beyond what most of the other Babis were about to accept.

Bábís were divided somewhat between those that viewed the movement as a break with Islam, centered around Táhirih, and those with a more cautious approach, centered around Quddus. As an act of symbolism, she took off her traditional veil in front of an assemblage of men on one occasion and brandished a sword on another. The unveiling caused shock and consternation amongst the men present. Prior to this, many had regarded Táhirih as the epitome of purity and the spiritual return of Fatimah, the daughter of Muhammad. Many screamed in horror at the sight, and one man was so horrified that he cut his own throat and, with blood pouring from his neck, fled the scene. Táhirih then arose and began a speech on the break from Islam. She quoted from the Quran, &quot;verily, amid gardens and rivers shall the pious dwell in the seat of truth, in the presence of the potent King&quot; as well as proclaiming herself the &quot;Word&quot; al-Qa&#x27;im would utter on the &quot;day of judgement&quot;. The unveiling caused great controversy that even led some of the Bábís to abandon their new faith.

The conference of Badasht is considered by Bábís and Baháʼís as a signal moment that demonstrated that the Sharia had been abrogated and superseded by Bábí law. The unveiling, however, led to accusations of immorality by Muslim clerics of the time, and later by a Christian missionary. The Báb responded to the accusations of immorality by supporting her position and endorsed the name Baháʼu&#x27;lláh gave her at the conference: &quot;the Pure&quot; (Táhirih). A jailer who had personal contact with her lauded her character and behavior and modern women scholars review this kind of accusation as part of a pattern faced by women leaders and writers then and since in a way that Azar Nafisi says, &quot;the Islamic regime today… fears them and feels vulnerable in the face of a resistance that is not just political but existential.&quot;

== Imprisonment and death (1848–1852) ==

After the conference at Badasht Táhirih and Quddus travelled to Mazandaran province together, where they then separated, very often facing harassment on their journey. There are conflicting reports as to the reason of this harassment. According to Lisan al-Mulk the harassment was due to their staying in the same inns, and using the same public bath. In a different account the Babis are harassed by anti-Babi inhabitants of villages that they pass through. Finally when they arrived in Barfurush, they were given some shelter among the Babis.

Nearby villagers attacked the Bábís and during that time Táhirih was captured, and put under house arrest in Tehran in the home of the Mahmud Khan. Whilst in the house of Mahmud Khan she earned respect from women around Tehran who flocked to see her and even the Mahmud Khan himself. Táhirih seemed to have gained the respect of Mahmud Khan and his family members. This is also her first visibility in western newspapers.

===Presentation at Court===

After her capture and arrest, Táhirih was escorted to Tehran. It was in Tehran that Táhirih was presented in the court to the young monarch Nasser-al-Din Shah. He was reported to have remarked &quot;I like her looks, leave her, and let her be&quot;. She was then taken to the home of the chief Mahmud Khan. The Shah then wrote her a letter in which he explained that she should deny the teachings of the Báb, and that if she did so then she would be given an exalted position in his harem. Táhirih rejected his advances through a poem which she composed. The Shah was reportedly gratified by her intelligence. Despite the Kings request for her to be left alone, she was placed under house arrest. The day before her Killing she was again presented to the King, who questioned her again about her beliefs. It was for four years that Táhirih remained a prisoner.

===Final sentence===

Though a prisoner, Táhirih still had relative freedom in the sense that she still taught her religion to people in the mayor&#x27;s house. She openly denounced polygamy, the veil and other restraints put upon women. Her words soon made her an influential character and women flocked to see Táhirih, including one princess of the Qajar family who converted. The clergy and members of the court, however, feared that she had grown too influential, and they organized seven conferences with Táhirih to convince her to recant her faith in the Báb. Instead, Táhirih presented religious &quot;proofs&quot; for the Báb&#x27;s cause and—at the last of these conferences—exclaimed &quot;when will you lift your eyes toward the Sun of Truth?&quot;. Her actions horrified the delegation and were regarded as unbecoming of a woman, no less one from her social background.

After the final conference, the delegation returned and began composing an edict denouncing Táhirih as a heretic, and implying that she should be sentenced to death. Táhirih was the first Iranian woman to be executed on grounds of &quot;corruption on earth,&quot; a charge regularly invoked by the Islamic Republic today. Táhirih was then confined to one room in the home of the mayor. She spent her last days in prayer, mediation and fasting. &quot;Weep not,&quot; she told the mayor&#x27;s wife, &quot;the hour when I shall be condemned to suffer martyrdom is fast approaching.&quot;

=== Execution ===

Two years after the execution of the Báb, three Bábís, acting on their own initiative, attempted to assassinate Nasser-al-Din Shah as he was returning from the chase to his palace at Niyávarfin. The attempt failed, but was the cause of a fresh persecution of the Bábí. Táhirih was blamed due to her Bábí faith. When told shortly beforehand about her execution, Táhirih kissed the hands of the messenger, dressed herself in bridal attire, anointed herself in perfume, and said her prayers. To the wife of Mahmud Khan, she made one request: that she be left in peace to continue her prayers in peace. The young son of Mahmud Khan accompanied Táhirih to the garden. To him she gave a white, silk handkerchief with which she had chosen to be strangled.

In the dead of the night and in secret, Táhirih was taken to the nearby garden of Ilkhani in Tehran, and with her own veil was strangled to death. Her body was thrown into a shallow well and stones thrown upon it. A prominent Bábí, and subsequently Baháʼí, historian cites the wife of an officer who had the chance to know her that she was strangled by a drunken officer of the government with her own veil which she had chosen for her anticipated martyrdom. One of her most notable quotes is her last words: &quot;You can kill me as soon as you like, but you cannot stop the emancipation of women.&quot; She was then aged about 35, and left behind three children. Dr Jakob Eduard Polak, the Shah&#x27;s physician, was an eyewitness to the execution and described it as: &quot;I was witness to the execution of Qurret el ayn, who was executed by the war minister and his adjutants; the beautiful woman endured her slow death with superhuman fortitude&quot;. ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá eulogized Táhirih writing that she was a &quot;woman chaste and holy, a sign and token of surpassing beauty, a burning brand of the love of God&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; on 13 October 1852 reports the death of Táhirih, describing her as the &quot;Fair Prophetess of Kazoeen&quot;, and the &quot;Bab&#x27;s Lieutenant&quot;.

== Legacy ==

Táhirih is considered one of the foremost women of the Bábí religion and an important figure in its development. As a charismatic individual, she was able to transcend the restrictions normally placed on women in traditional society where she lived, and thus attracted attention to the Cause. She wrote copiously on Bábí matters, and of that volume about a dozen significant works and a dozen personal letters have survived. They are outlined (including the contents of some further treatises that have been lost) by Denis MacEoin in &#x27;The Sources for Early Babi Doctrines and History&#x27; 107–116. Around 50 poems are attributed to her, and are regarded highly in Persian culture.

In addition to being well known among Baháʼís, who consider her one of the leading women figures of their religion, Táhirih&#x27;s influence has extended beyond the Baháʼí community as her life has come to inspire later generations of feminists. Azar Nafisi, a notable Iranian academic and author, has referred to her influence, saying that &quot;the first woman to unveil and to question both political and religious orthodoxy was a woman named Táhirih who lived in [the] early 1800s... And we carry this tradition.&quot; Shahrnush Parsipur mentions her in a kind of genealogy of women writers she is inspired by. Azer Jafarov, professor at Baku State University, Azerbaijan, stated that &quot;she influenced modern literature, raised the call for the emancipation of women, and had a deep impact on public consciousness.

A very early western account of Táhirih would have been on January 2, 1913 when ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá, then head of the Baháʼí Faith, spoke on women&#x27;s suffrage to the Women&#x27;s Freedom League – part of his address and print coverage of his talk noted mentions of Táhirih to the organization.

== In art ==

Táhirh has been a focus of some writers of the Baháʼí Faith in fiction. Polish/Russian playwright Isabella Grinevskaya wrote the play &quot;Báb&quot; based on the life and events of the founder of the Bábí religion with a focus on Táhirih. which was performed in St. Petersburg in 1904 and again in 1916/7, and lauded by Leo Tolstoy and other reviewers at the time. In Velimir Khlebnikov&#x27;s writings and poems she is mentioned frequently (as ); a number of Khlebnikov&#x27;s poems describes her execution (sometimes mistakenly as a burning on a stake).

About 1908 Constance Faunt Le Roy Runcie attempted to publish a novel about the Bab and &quot;Persia&#x27;s celebrated poetess Zerryn Taj&quot; (another of Tahirih&#x27;s names.)

Bahiyyih Nakhjavani published her &quot;La femme qui lisait trop (The Woman Who Reads Too Much)&quot; in 2007, the English edition was published in 2015. It tells the story of Táhirih. The writer adopts the revolving points of view of mother, sister, daughter, and wife respectively, to trace the impact of this woman&#x27;s actions on her contemporaries and read her prophetic insights.

Nazanin Afshin-Jam is set to play a role as Tahirih in a film by Jack Lenz named &quot;Mona&#x27;s Dream&quot; about the life story of Mona Mahmudnizhad.

Sarah Bernhardt, the best known French actress of her day, asked two of her contemporary authors, Catulle Mendès and Henri Antoine Jules-Bois, to write a play about Tahirih and the Babis for her to portray on stage. Catulle Mendes wrote in &quot;Le Figaro&quot; that it was after reading &quot;Les Religions et les Philosophies dans l´Asie centrale&quot; by Arthur de Gobineau that he had the idea to write a drama about Tahéreh Qurrat al-`Ain.

In 2015, during the Adelaide Fringe, Delia Olam co-wrote and staged a one-woman play &quot;Just let the wind untie my perfumed hair&quot;, based on Tahirih&#x27;s final days as seen through several eyewitnesses. Some of Tahirih&#x27;s poetry, in English translation, was sung to cello or dulcimer accompaniment.

Shabnam Tolouei Iranian actress and filmmaker living in France, has made a documentary of 67 minutes about the life of Tahirih Qurratul&#x27;Ayn, in April 2016. The film, called &quot;Dust-Flower-Flame&quot;, is in Persian language with English and French subtitles.

Russell Garcia and Gina Garcia have composed a musical drama titled &quot;The Unquenchable Flame&quot; about Táhirih&#x27;s life, with Tierney Sutton in the role of Táhirih.

<text>USS &quot;Cone&quot; (DD-866) was a of the United States Navy, named for Rear Admiral &quot;Hutch&quot; Cone USN (1871–1941). She was laid down by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation at Staten Island, New York, on 30 November 1944, launched on 10 May 1945 by Mrs. H. I. Cone, and commissioned on 18 August 1945.

&quot;Cone&quot; alternated operations along the east coast and in the Caribbean with the 2nd Fleet. She deployed with the 6th Fleet to the Mediterranean, participated in Sea Dragon and Market Time operations, patrolled on search and rescue duties, and carried out Naval Gunfire Support missions during the Vietnam War.

==History==
&quot;Cone&quot;″s first cruise was to Portsmouth, England, between 12 February and 9 April 1946. After a week at Newport, Rhode Island, she sailed on an extensive goodwill tour to ports in northern and southern Europe, welcoming visitors at each city. &quot;Cone&quot; returned to Newport on 24 October 1946. She operated along the east coast and in the Caribbean from her homeport of Norfolk, Virginia, until the summer of 1947; then carried midshipmen on a training cruise to northern Europe.

Continuing training and service activities along the east coast and in the Caribbean, when not deployed, &quot;Cone&quot; served her first tour of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean in 1948, joining the United Nations Palestine Patrol. She returned to the Mediterranean in 1949, and later that year crossed the Arctic Circle on maneuvers. East coast and Caribbean operations and another 6th Fleet tour occupied &quot;Cone&quot; in 1950. Her 1951 Mediterranean cruise was highlighted with a visit by Winston Churchill at Venice on 9 September, and. by Cone&#x27;s transportation of the United States and British Ambassadors to Greece on a diplomatic call on the monasteries of Mount Athos. She served again in the Mediterranean in 1952, and on 28 August 1953, cleared Newport for a cruise around the world, sailing by way of Panama, San Diego, Pearl Harbor, Midway, and Yokosuka to join TF 77 on patrol off Korea, and continuing home with calls at Hong Kong, Bahrein, Port Said, Naples, Villefranche, and Lisbon, returning to Norfolk 9 April 1954.

From September to November 1954, Cone sailed to join other NATO navies in antisubmarine training off Ireland and in Operation &quot;Blackjack,&quot; then called briefly at Mediterranean ports. Nineteen fifty-five found her concentrating on air defense exercises and acting as planeguard for carriers. In 1956, she joined in NATO exercises in the Mediterranean, returning home in June. Alerted during the Suez Crisis, she joined a task force which sailed to the eastern Atlantic to stand by, then called at Lisbon and returned home when its services were not needed. In 1958 and 1959-60 Cone served with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean; through the remainder of the 1960s, she conducted exercises in the Caribbean, operated locally from her new home port, Charleston, S.C., and visited northern European waters during NATO maneuvers.

==Decommissioning and transfer==
&quot;Cone&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 October 1982, transferred to Pakistan and renamed Alamgir. She was commissioned at Charleston on 1 October 1982. She was decommissioned on 4 December 1998 and scrapped.

<text>USS &quot;Stribling&quot; was a in the United States Navy. She was the second US Navy ship named for Admiral Cornelius Kincheloe Stribling.

&quot;Stribling&quot; was laid down by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation at Staten Island in New York on 15 January 1945, launched on 8 June 1945 by Mrs. W. Hunter Powell and commissioned on 29 September 1945.

==Service history==

===1945–1950===
&quot;Stribling&quot; shook down out of Guantánamo Bay, Cuba; then reported for duty at the Fleet Sonar School at Key West, Florida. In 1948, she embarked upon the first of a career-long series of deployments to the Mediterranean Sea. Between 1948 and 1953, &quot;Stribling&quot; spent a portion of each year in the &quot;middle sea.&quot; During the 1948 cruise, she flew the United Nations flag while on Palestine Patrol. In 1949, she became the first American ship to visit a Spanish port since the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. While deployed with the 6th Fleet again in 1950, she visited a number of northern European ports.

===1953–1958===
On 23 August 1953, &quot;Stribling&quot; set sail from Norfolk for the Panama Canal and duty with the Pacific Fleet. She reached Yokosuka on 3 October and, after a brief upkeep period, commenced Korean War operations. The destroyer operated intermittently with the carriers of Task Force (TF) 77 in the Sea of Japan and with TF 95, the United Nations Escort and Blockading Force, along the west coast of Korea and in the Yellow Sea. When not patrolling with TF 95 or TF 77, &quot;Stribling&quot; trained and visited Far Eastern ports for liberty.

In March 1954, she continued her voyage around the world. On the 19th, she put into Port Said, Egypt, and then sailed through the Mediterranean, visiting the sunny liberty ports along the way. On 10 April, she completed her circumnavigation of the globe at Norfolk. Over the next six years, &quot;Stribling&quot; resumed her schedule of 6th Fleet deployments alternated with tours of duty with the 2nd Fleet in the western Atlantic and Caribbean Sea. Constant training and exercises, both American and NATO, characterized the bulk of her activities during that period. She was in the Mediterranean in 1958 during the Lebanon crisis and stood by to lend a hand until it was resolved.

===1960–1969===
The period from June 1960 to April 1966 brought significant changes to &quot;Stribling&quot;. From June 1960 until April 1966, she was modified extensively at the Charleston Navy Yard under the Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) program. After refresher training out of Guantanamo Bay and participation in NATO exercise &quot;Lime Jug,&quot; &quot;Stribling&quot; stood watch during the recovery of astronaut, John Glenn, in February 1962. In August, she deployed to the 6th Fleet, but spent at least a third of that tour in the vicinity of the Persian Gulf, operating with the Middle East Force. She exercised with units of the Saudi Arabian and Iranian navies and visited many new ports, notably Djibouti in French Somaliland, Kharg Island in Iran, and Aden. &quot;Stribling&quot;&#x27;s next two deployments were also with the Middle East Force. In the spring of 1966, the destroyer received a Drone Antisubmarine Helicopter (DASH) system and, by 4 May 1966, completed DASH qualification. In February and March 1966, she participated in Polaris missile firing tests on the Atlantic test range.

On 30 January 1969, &quot;Stribling&quot; put to sea from Mayport, Florida, to make her second voyage to the Far East. Heading via the Panama Canal, San Diego, and Pearl Harbor, the destroyer made for Yokosuka, Japan, and then operations off the coast of Vietnam. &quot;Stribling&quot; participated in &quot;Sea Dragon&quot; and &quot;Market Time&quot; operations, and her duties also included bombardments on the gunline, search and rescue missions usually for downed carrier pilots, and Positive Identification Radar Advisory Zone (PIRAZ) duty. The latter assignment involved riding &quot;shotgun&quot; for larger PIRAZ ships armed with more sophisticated radar and target designation systems. That summer, &quot;Stribling&quot; plane-guarded for the carriers operating on &quot;Yankee Station&quot; in the Gulf of Tonkin. When not operating in the combat zone, she put into Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Hong Kong; and Subic Bay in the Philippines for repairs after a collision with a barge being towed by RVN tug during a nighttime underway replenishment . On 2 August 1969, &quot;Stribling&quot; cleared the combat zone to return home. On her way, she stopped at Kure and Yokosuka, Japan; Pearl Harbor; San Diego; Acapulco Mexico, and Panama. On 17 September 1969, she reentered Mayport.

===1970–1976===
Upon her return from Vietnam, &quot;Stribling&quot; resumed her routine of Mediterranean deployments and Atlantic seaboard duty. The first 6th Fleet deployment (from August 1970 to March 1971) was an active tour of duty, encompassing as it did the Jordanian crisis of 1970. With Syrian elements and left-wing Jordanians attempting to topple King Hussein from his throne, the 6th Fleet was mobilized to maintain a striking force poised in the eastern Mediterranean. Operating in much the same manner as she did in Vietnam in 1969, &quot;Stribling&quot; cruised along the coast of Syria on Bravo Station in the anti-aircraft screen for the 6th Fleet until the crisis abated. On 22 October, &quot;Stribling&quot; pursued an unidentified nuclear submarine, stalking her quarry for almost 48 hours.

&quot;Stribling&quot;″s second deployment, from February until September 1972, was far more routine. It was given over to normal operations and exercises with other units of the fleet and with units of foreign navies. In March 1973, she sailed around the Cape of Good Hope and up through the Indian Ocean to rejoin the Middle East Force. After her return to the United States from that deployment, &quot;Stribling&quot; operated with the 2nd Fleet in the western Atlantic. She left the area only once in that time, during September and October 1974, to participate in exercise &quot;Northern Merger.&quot; That cruise took her to the Netherlands and England for port visits. In mid-October 1974, she resumed her eastern seaboard operations.

The aging &quot;Stribling&quot; made her final Mediterranean cruise in early 1976, just before decommissioning, due to urgent deployment requirements during this period. &quot;Stribling&quot; was equipped with electronic intelligence gear on the helicopter deck for this cruise, as well as with experimental sonar &quot;classification&quot; equipment installed by the University of Texas. &quot;Stribling&quot; made this last cruise with concrete poured into her bilges to stop many hull leaks that had not been repaired.

===Decommissioning and disposal===
&quot;Stribling&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 July 1976. She was sunk as a target on 27 July 1980.

One of her anchors currently resides on display outside VFW Post #220 in Mays Landing, New Jersey.

==Awards==
&quot;Stribling&quot; earned two battle stars during the Vietnam War.
Per Navy Unit Awards posted on awards.navy.mil for the USS Stribling DD-867, the ship received the Navy&#x27;s Meritorious Unit Commendation for the period 12 September 1970 to 31 October 1970. She earned the Navy Expeditionary Medal for the period 1 July 1961 to 18 August 1961. The Stribling also earned credit for the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for the periods 17 to 23 July 1958; 25 June 1968; and 9 to 15 June 1969. Credit for Vietnam Service was accrued during the periods 20 March 1969 to 25 April 1969; 4 to 26 May 1969; 28 June 1969 to 2 July 1969; and 12 July 1969 to 3 August 1969. The Stribling also earned credit for the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation with Palm during the periods 21 March 1969 to 2 April 1969; and 23 to 26 July 1969.

<text>Butaritari is an atoll in the Pacific Ocean island nation of Kiribati. The atoll is roughly four-sided. The south and southeast portion of the atoll comprises a nearly continuous islet. The atoll reef is continuous but almost without islets along the north side. Bikati and Bikatieta islets occupy a corner of the reef at the extreme northwest tip of the atoll. Small islets are found on reef sections between channels on the west side. The lagoon of Butaritari is deep and can accommodate large ships, though the entrance passages are relatively narrow. It is the most fertile of the Gilbert Islands, with relatively good soils (for an atoll) and high rainfall. Butaritari atoll has a land area of and a population of 3,224 . During World War II, Butaritari was known by United States Armed Forces as Makin Atoll, and was the site of the Battle of Makin. Locally, Makin is the name of a separate but closest atoll, to the northeast of Butaritari, but close enough to be seen. These two atolls share a dialect of the Gilbertese language.

==Geography==

Butaritari is the second most northerly of the Gilbert Islands; to the northeast is Makin. Butaritari was called Makin Atoll by the U.S. military, and present-day Makin was then known as Makin Meang (Northern Makin) or Little Makin to distinguish it. Now that Butaritari has become the preferred name for the larger atoll, speakers tend to drop the qualifier for Makin. Butaritari has also previously been known as Pitt Island, Taritari Island, or Touching Island.

The atoll is roughly four-sided and nearly across in the east–west direction, and averages about north to south. The reef is more submerged and broken into several broad channels along the west side. Small islets are found on reef sections between these channels. The atoll reef is continuous but almost without islets along the north side. In the northeast corner, the reef is some across and with only scattered small islet development. Thus, the lagoon of Butaritari is very open to exchange with the ocean. The lagoon is deep and can accommodate large ships, though the entrance passages are relatively narrow.

The south and southeast portion of the atoll comprises a nearly continuous islet, broken only by a single, broad section of interislet reef. These islets are mostly between and across, but widen in the areas where the reef changes directions. Mangrove swamps appear well developed in these latter areas as well as all along the southern lagoon shore. (Narrow islets are somewhat characteristic of Kiribati atolls running east–west.)

Bikati and Bikatieta islets occupy a corner of the reef at the extreme northwest tip of the atoll, bordering a small lagoon to the north of the main lagoon. There is a village on the larger Bikati (2 by 0.5 km).

===Environmental issues===
Seepage of saltwater into the pits in which &quot;babai&quot; (&quot;Cyrtosperma merkusii&quot; or &quot;giant swamp taro&quot;) is grown is the major concern of islanders. The erosion problems are identified as being linked to aggregate mining, land reclamation and the construction of causeways that is thought to change the currents along the shoreline. The causeways have also resulted to reduced flushing of the lagoon that has resulted in low levels of oxygen, therefore causing damage to fish stocks in the lagoon and causes other biological problems. Aggregate mining and the removal of coral boulders is exacerbating coastal erosion.

===Villages===
The population of Butaritari in the 2010 Census was 4,346 people, inhabiting twelve villages:

===Climate===
Butaritari is one of the lushest of the islands of Kiribati due to good rainfall. Typical annual rainfall is about 4 m, compared with about 2 m on Tarawa Atoll and 1 m in the far south of Kiribati. Rainfall on Butaritari is enhanced during an El Niño.

==Economy==

Butaritari has rich marine resources, with a large lagoon and wide reef. Butaritari has the greatest potential for agriculture in Kiribati: bananas, breadfruit and papaya grow well, and successful cultivars of pumpkin, cabbage, cucumber, eggplant and other vegetables have been created with assistance from the Taiwan Technical Mission based in South Tarawa. However, most households keep to a subsistence lifestyle and, although food is plentiful, money is often scarce as there are few paid jobs on the island.

==History==

===Early history===

====Myths and legends====
There are different stories told as to the creation of Butaritari and the other islands in the Southern Gilberts. An important legend in the culture of Butaritari is that spirits who lived in a tree in Samoa migrated northward carrying branches from the tree, &quot;Te Kaintikuaba&quot;, which translates as the tree of life. It was these spirits, together with Nareau the Wise who created the islands of Tungaru (the Gilbert Islands).

====1606 to 1899====
The Spanish expedition led by Pedro Fernandes de Queirós sighted the &quot;Buen Viaje&quot; (good trip in Spanish) Islands (Butaritari and Makin) on 8 July 1606.

Traditionally, Butaritari and Makin were ruled by a chief or &quot;Uea&quot; who lived on Butaritari Island. This chief had all the powers and authority to make and impose decisions for Butaritari and Makin, a system very different from the southern Gilbert Islands where power was wielded collectively by the &quot;unimwane&quot; or old men.

The people of Kuma village had the power to call dolphins or whales, and used this ability on special occasions to provide meat for important feasts such as the opening of a new maneaba.

The islands were visited as part of the United States Exploring Expedition in 1841. Any possible Guano Islands Act claim by the United States to Butaritari and Little Makin was renounced in the 1970s.

The first traders resident in the Gilberts were Randell and Durant who arrived in 1846. Durant moved on to Makin, while Randell remained on Butaritari. The earliest trading companies on Butaritari were the Hamburg-based Handels-und Plantagen-Gesellschaft der Südsee-Inseln zu Hamburg (DHPG) with Pacific headquarters in Samoa, and On Chong (Chinese traders with Australian connections via the goldfields). These traders helped Butaritari became the commercial and trading capital of the Gilbert Islands until Burns Philp, a powerful trading company, moved to Tarawa, following the seat of political power.

Robert Louis Stevenson, Fanny Vandegrift Stevenson and Lloyd Osbourne visited Butaritari from 14 July 1889 to early August. At this time Nakaeia was the ruler of Butaritari and Makin atolls, his father being Tebureimoa and his grandfather being Tetimararoa. Nakaeia was described by Stevenson as “a fellow of huge physical strength, masterful, violent … Alone in his islands it was he who dealt and profited; he was the planter and the merchant” with his subjects toiling in servitude and fear.

Nakaeia allowed two San Francisco trading firms to operate, Messrs. Crawford and Messrs. Wightman Brothers, with up to 12 Europeans resident on islands of the atolls. The presence of the Europeans, and the alcohol they traded to the islanders, resulted in periodic alcoholic binges that only ended with Nakaeia making tapu (forbidding) the sale of alcohol. During the 15 or so days that Stevenson spent on Butaritari the islanders were engaged in a drunken spree that threatened the safety of Stevenson and his family. Stevenson adopted the strategy of describing himself as the son of Queen Victoria so as to ensure that he would be treated as a person who should not be threatened or harmed.

The last &quot;Uea&quot; was Nauraura Nakoriri who was in power both before and after the Gilberts became a British Protectorate in 1892.

====1900 to 1941====
Butaritari Post Office opened on 1 January 1911.

The Japanese trading company Nanyo Boeki Kabushiki Kaisha established operations in Butaritari Village. W. R. Carpenter &amp; Co. (Solomon Islands) Ltd was established in 1922. Through the 1920s On Chong experienced gradual decline in its operations as the result of low copra prices. Eventually On Chong was taken over by W. R. Carpenter &amp; Co.

=== World War II ===
====Japanese invasion====
On 10 December 1941, three days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, 300 Japanese troops, plus laborers of the &quot;Gilberts Invasion Special Landing Force&quot; arrived off Butaritari — then known as &quot;Makin&quot; — and occupied without resistance. Lying east of the Marshall Islands, Makin would make an excellent seaplane base, extending Japanese air patrols closer to Howland Island, Baker Island, Tuvalu, Phoenix and Ellice Islands, all held by the Allies and protecting the eastern flank of the Japanese perimeter from an Allied attack.

====American raid====
Butaritari atoll was the site of the Makin Raid in August 1942, when two companies of the 2nd Marine Raider Battalion landed from the submarines USS &quot;Argonaut&quot; and USS &quot;Nautilus&quot;, as a feint to draw Japanese attention away from the planned invasion route through the Solomons. While they annihilated the local garrison, they failed in their initial objectives of taking prisoners and gathering intelligence.

====American invasion====

On the eve of invasion, the Japanese garrison consisted of 806 men. Most were of aviation or Japanese and Korean labor units who had little or no combat training and were not assigned weapons or a battle station. The number of trained combat troops on Makin was no more than 300 soldiers. The garrison included three tanks and three 37 mm (1.5 inch) anti-tank guns.

Butaritari&#x27;s land defenses were centered around the lagoon shore, near the seaplane base in the central part of the island. A series of strongpoints was established along Butaritari&#x27;s ocean side as the Japanese expected the invasion to come from there, following the example of a raid in 1942. Without aircraft, ships, or hope of reinforcement or relief, the outnumbered and outgunned defenders could only try to delay the American attack for as long as possible.

American air operations began on November 13, 1943, followed by bombardment from fire support ships. Troops began to go ashore on November 20, and the attacking troops knocked out the fortified strongpoints one by one. Despite their great superiority in men and weapons, the Americans had considerable difficulty subduing the island&#x27;s small defensive force. On November 23 the force commander reported &quot;Makin taken.&quot;

As compared to an estimated 395 Japanese and Koreans killed in action, American combat casualties numbered 66 killed and 152 wounded. But when the American losses incurred during the sinking of the escort carrier USS &quot;Liscome Bay&quot; on November 24 by a Japanese submarine are included, the loss balance tips toward the other side. Counting the 687 sailors who went down with the carrier, American casualties exceeded the strength of the entire Japanese garrison on Makin.

== Visiting Butaritari ==
Butaritari is served by a twice weekly air service connecting with neighbouring Makin and the capital, South Tarawa, provided by Air Kiribati. The runway of Butaritari Atoll Airport was originally built as the World War II American strip &quot;(Starmann Field)&quot;. An international air service with a route of Tarawa Atoll–Butaritari–Majuro operated for a short period in 1995. The aim was to facilitate the development of a strong cash crop economy on the island and link the Marshall Islands with Kiribati. With the demise of Air Nauru in 2008, the only international air connection is through South Tarawa, which is connected by a twice weekly Fiji Airways flight with Fiji.

There are three guesthouses on Butaritari, providing a basic level of accommodation aimed mainly at government staff and visitors, though tourists are welcomed.

<text>Venetian, also known as wider Venetian or Venetan ( or ), is a Romance language spoken natively in the northeast of Italy, mostly in Veneto, where most of the five million inhabitants can understand it. It is sometimes spoken and often well understood outside Veneto: in Trentino, Friuli, the Julian March, Istria, and some towns of Slovenia, Dalmatia (Croatia) and Bay of Kotor (Montenegro) by a surviving autochthonous Venetian population, and in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, the United States and the United Kingdom by Venetians in the diaspora.

Although referred to as an &quot;Italian dialect&quot; (; ) even by some of its speakers, the label is primarily geographic. Venetian is a separate language from Italian, with many local varieties. Its precise place within the Romance language family remains somewhat controversial. Both Ethnologue and Glottolog group it into the Gallo-Italic branch (and thus, closer to French and Emilian–Romagnol than to Italian). Devoto, Avolio and Ursini reject such classification, and Tagliavini places it in the Italo-Dalmatian branch of Romance.

==History==
Like all members of the Romance language family, Venetian evolved from Vulgar Latin, and is thus a sister language of Italian and other Romance languages. Venetian is first attested in writing in the 13th century.

The language enjoyed substantial prestige in the days of the Republic of Venice, when it attained the status of a lingua franca in the Mediterranean Sea. Notable Venetian-language authors include the playwrights Ruzante (1502–1542), Carlo Goldoni (1707–1793) and Carlo Gozzi (1720–1806). Following the old Italian theatre tradition (), they used Venetian in their comedies as the speech of the common folk. They are ranked among the foremost Italian theatrical authors of all time, and plays by Goldoni and Gozzi are still performed today all over the world.

Other notable works in Venetian are the translations of the &quot;Iliad&quot; by Giacomo Casanova (1725–1798) and Francesco Boaretti, the translation of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; (1875) by Giuseppe Cappelli and the poems of Biagio Marin (1891–1985). Notable too is a manuscript titled &quot;Dialogo de Cecco di Ronchitti da Bruzene in perpuosito de la stella Nuova&quot; attributed to Girolamo Spinelli, perhaps with some supervision by Galileo Galilei for scientific details.

Several VenetianItalian dictionaries are available in print and online, including those by Boerio, Contarini, Nazari and Piccio.

As a literary language, Venetian was overshadowed by Dante Alighieri&#x27;s Tuscan dialect (the best known writers of the Renaissance, such as Petrarch, Boccaccio and Machiavelli, were Tuscan and wrote in the Tuscan language) and languages of France like the Occitano-Romance languages and the langues d&#x27;oïl including the mixed Franco-Venetian.

Even before the demise of the Republic, Venetian gradually ceased to be used for administrative purposes in favor of the Tuscan-derived Italian language that had been proposed and used as a vehicle for a common Italian culture, strongly supported by eminent Venetian humanists and poets, from Pietro Bembo (1470–1547), a crucial figure in the development of the Italian language itself, to Ugo Foscolo (1778–1827).

Venetian spread to other continents as a result of mass migration from the Veneto region between 1870 and 1905, and between 1945 and 1960. Venetian migrants created large Venetian-speaking communities in Argentina, Brazil (see Talian), and Mexico (see Chipilo Venetian dialect), where the language is still spoken today.

In the 19th century, large-scale immigration towards Trieste and Muggia extended the presence of the Venetian language eastward. Previously, the dialect of Trieste had been a Rhaeto-Romance dialect known as Tergestino. This dialect became extinct as a result of Venetian migration, which gave rise to the Triestino dialect of Venetian spoken there today.

Internal migrations during the 20th century also saw many Venetian-speakers settle in other regions of Italy, especially in the Pontine Marshes of southern Lazio where they populated new towns such as Latina, Aprilia and Pomezia, forming there the so-called &quot;Venetian-Pontine&quot; community (&quot;comunità venetopontine&quot;).

Some firms have chosen to use Venetian language in advertising, as a beer did some years ago (, &#x27;only the name is foreign&#x27;). In other cases advertisements in Veneto are given a &quot;Venetian flavour&quot; by adding a Venetian word to standard Italian: for instance an airline used the verb ( , &quot;it is always bigger&quot;) into an Italian sentence (the correct Venetian being ) to advertise new flights from Marco Polo Airport.

In 2007, Venetian was given recognition by the Regional Council of Veneto with regional law no. 8 of 13 April 2007 &quot;Protection, enhancement and promotion of the linguistic and cultural heritage of Veneto&quot;. Though the law does not explicitly grant Venetian any official status, it provides for Venetian as object of protection and enhancement, as an essential component of the cultural, social, historical and civil identity of Veneto.

==Geographic distribution==

Venetian is spoken mainly in the Italian regions of Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia and in both Slovenia and Croatia (Istria, Dalmatia and the Kvarner Gulf). Smaller communities are found in Lombardy (Mantua), Trentino, Emilia-Romagna (Rimini and Forlì), Sardinia (Arborea, Terralba, Fertilia), Lazio (Pontine Marshes), Tuscany (Grossetan Maremma) and formerly in Romania (Tulcea).

It is also spoken in North and South America by the descendants of Italian immigrants. Notable examples of this are Argentina and Brazil, particularly the city of São Paulo and the Talian dialect spoken in the Brazilian states of Espírito Santo, São Paulo, Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina.

In Mexico, the Chipilo Venetian dialect is spoken in the state of Puebla and the town of Chipilo. The town was settled by immigrants from the Veneto region, and some of their descendants have preserved the language to this day. People from Chipilo have gone on to make satellite colonies in Mexico, especially in the states of Guanajuato, Querétaro, and State of Mexico. Venetian has also survived in the state of Veracruz, where other Italian migrants have settled since the late 19th century. The people of Chipilo preserve their dialect and call it , and it has been preserved as a variant since the 19th century. The variant of Venetian spoken by the () is northern Trevisàn-Feltrìn-Belumàt.

In 2009, the Brazilian city of Serafina Corrêa, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, gave Talian a joint official status alongside Portuguese. Until the middle of the 20th century, Venetian was also spoken on the Greek Island of Corfu, which had long been under the rule of the Republic of Venice. Moreover, Venetian had been adopted by a large proportion of the population of Cephalonia, one of the Ionian Islands, because the island was part of the for almost three centuries.

==Classification==

Venetian is a Romance language and thus descends from Vulgar Latin. Its classification has always been controversial: According to Tagliavini, for example, it is one of the Italo-Dalmatian languages and most closely related to Istriot on the one hand and Tuscan–Italian on the other. Some authors include it among the Gallo-Italic languages, and according to others, it is not related to either one. Although both Ethnologue and Glottolog group Venetian into the Gallo-Italic languages, the linguists Giacomo Devoto and Francesco Avolio and the Treccani encyclopedia reject the Gallo-Italic classification.

Although the language region is surrounded by Gallo-Italic languages, Venetian does not share some traits with these immediate neighbors. Some scholars stress Venetian&#x27;s characteristic lack of Gallo-Italic traits () or traits found further afield in Gallo-Romance languages (e.g. French, Franco-Provençal) or the Rhaeto-Romance languages (e.g. Friulian, Romansh). For example, Venetian did not undergo vowel rounding or nasalization, palatalize and , or develop rising diphthongs and , and it preserved final syllables, whereas, as in Italian, Venetian diphthongization occurs in historically open syllables. On the other hand, Venetian does share many other traits with its surrounding Gallo-Italic languages, like interrogative clitics, mandatory unstressed subject pronouns (with some exceptions), the &quot;to be behind to&quot; verbal construction to express the continuous aspect (&quot;El ze drio manjar&quot; = He is eating, lit. he is behind to eat) and the absence of the absolute past tense as well as of geminated consonants. In addition, Venetian has some unique traits which are shared by neither Gallo-Italic, nor Italo-Dalmatian languages, such as the use of the impersonal passive forms and the use of the auxiliary verb &quot;to have&quot; for the reflexive voice (both traits shared with German).

Modern Venetian is not a close relative of the extinct Venetic language spoken in Veneto before Roman expansion, although both are Indo-European, and Venetic may have been an Italic language, like Latin, the ancestor of Venetian and most other languages of Italy. The ancient Veneti gave their name to the city and region, which is why the modern language has a similar name, while their language may have also left a few traces in modern Venetian as a substrate.

==Regional variants==
The main regional varieties and subvarieties of Venetian language:
* &quot;Central&quot; (Padua, Vicenza, Polesine), with about 1,500,000 speakers
*Venice
*&quot;Eastern/Coastal&quot; (Trieste, Grado, Istria, Fiume)
* &quot;Western&quot; (Verona, Trentino)
* &quot;Northern&quot; of the Province of Treviso (most of the Province of Pordenone)
* &quot;North-Central&quot; of the Province of Treviso (Belluno, comprising Feltre, Agordo, Cadore, and Zoldo Alto)

All these variants are mutually intelligible, with a minimum 92% in common among the most diverging ones (Central and Western). Modern speakers reportedly can still understand Venetian texts from the 14th century to some extent.

Other noteworthy variants are:
* the variety spoken in Chioggia
* the variety spoken in the Pontine Marshes
* the variety spoken in Dalmatia
* the Talian dialect of Antônio Prado, Entre Rios, Santa Catarina and Toledo, Paraná, among other southern Brazilian cities
* the Chipilo Venetian dialect () of Chipilo, Mexico
* the extinct Judeo-Venetian dialect formerly spoken by the Jewish community of Venice

==Grammar==

Like most Romance languages, Venetian has mostly abandoned the Latin case system, in favor of prepositions and a more rigid subject–verb–object sentence structure. It has thus become more analytic, if not quite as much as English. Venetian also has the Romance articles, both definite (derived from the Latin demonstrative ) and indefinite (derived from the numeral ).

Venetian also retained the Latin concepts of gender (masculine and feminine) and number (singular and plural). Unlike the Gallo-Iberian languages, which form plurals by adding &quot;-s&quot;, Venetian forms plurals in a manner similar to standard Italian. Nouns and adjectives can be modified by suffixes that indicate several qualities such as size, endearment, deprecation, etc. Adjectives (usually postfixed) and articles are inflected to agree with the noun in gender and number, but it is important to mention that the suffix might be deleted because the article is the part that suggests the number. However, Italian is influencing Venetian language:

In recent studies on Venetian variants in Veneto, there has been a tendency to write the so-called &quot;evanescent L&quot; as . While it may help novice speakers, Venetian was never written with this letter. In this article, this symbol is used only in Veneto dialects of Venetian language. It will suffice to know that in Venetian language the letter L in word-initial and intervocalic positions usually becomes a &quot;palatal allomorph&quot;, and is barely pronounced.

Very few Venetic words seem to have survived in present Venetian, but there may be more traces left in the morphology, such as the morpheme -&quot;esto&quot;/&quot;asto&quot;/&quot;isto&quot; for the past participle, which can be found in Venetic inscriptions from about 500 BC:

* Venetian: (&quot;I have done&quot;)
* Venetian Italian: 
* Standard Italian: 

===Redundant subject pronouns===
A peculiarity of Venetian grammar is a &quot;semi-analytical&quot; verbal flexion, with a compulsory clitic subject pronoun before the verb in many sentences, echoing the subject as an ending or a weak pronoun. Independent/emphatic pronouns (e.g. ), on the contrary, are optional. The clitic subject pronoun () is used with the 2nd and 3rd person singular, and with the 3rd person plural. This feature may have arisen as a compensation for the fact that the 2nd- and 3rd-person inflections for most verbs, which are still distinct in Italian and many other Romance languages, are identical in Venetian.

The Piedmontese language also has clitic subject pronouns, but the rules are somewhat different. The function of clitics is particularly visible in long sentences, which do not always have clear intonational breaks to easily tell apart vocative and imperative in sharp commands from exclamations with &quot;shouted indicative&quot;. For instance, in Venetian the clitic marks the indicative verb and its masculine singular subject, otherwise there is an imperative preceded by a vocative. Although some grammars regard these clitics as &quot;redundant&quot;, they actually provide specific additional information as they mark number and gender, thus providing number-/gender- agreement between the subject(s) and the verb, which does not necessarily show this information on its endings.

===Interrogative inflection===
Venetian also has a special &quot;interrogative&quot; verbal flexion used for direct questions, which also incorporates a redundant pronoun:

===Auxiliary verbs===
Reflexive tenses use the auxiliary verb (&quot;to have&quot;), as in English, the North Germanic languages, Catalan, Spanish, Romanian and Neapolitan; instead of (&quot;to be&quot;), which would be normal in Italian. The past participle is invariable, unlike Italian:

===Continuing action===
Another peculiarity of the language is the use of the phrase (literally, &quot;to be behind&quot;) to indicate continuing action:

Another progressive form in some Venetian dialects uses the construction (lit. &quot;to be there that&quot;):

* Venetian dialect: (lit. &quot;My father he is there that he speaks&quot;).

The use of progressive tenses is more pervasive than in Italian; e.g.

* English: &quot;He wouldn&#x27;t have been speaking to you&quot;.
* Venetian: .

That construction does not occur in Italian: &quot;*Non sarebbe mica stato parlandoti&quot; is not syntactically valid.

===Subordinate clauses===
Subordinate clauses have double introduction (&quot;whom that&quot;, &quot;when that&quot;, &quot;which that&quot;, &quot;how that&quot;), as in Old English:

As in other Romance languages, the subjunctive mood is widely used in subordinate clauses.

==Phonology==

=== Consonants ===
Some dialects of Venetian have certain sounds not present in Italian, such as the interdental voiceless fricative , often spelled with , , , or , and similar to English &quot;th&quot; in &quot;thing&quot; and &quot;thought&quot;. This sound occurs, for example, in (&quot;supper&quot;, also written ), which is pronounced the same as Castilian Spanish (which has the same meaning). The voiceless interdental fricative occurs in Bellunese, north-Trevisan, and in some Central Venetian rural areas around Padua, Vicenza and the mouth of the river Po.

Because the pronunciation variant is more typical of older speakers and speakers living outside of major cities, it has come to be socially stigmatized, and most speakers now use or instead of . In those dialects with the pronunciation , the sound has fallen together with ordinary , and so it is not uncommon to simply write (or between vowels) instead of or (such as ).

Similarly some dialects of Venetian also have a voiced interdental fricative , often written (as in &#x27;he cries&#x27;); but in most dialects this sound is now pronounced either as (Italian &quot;voiced-Z&quot;), or more typically as (Italian &quot;voiced-S&quot;, written , as in ); in a few dialects the sound appears as and may therefore be written instead with the letter , as in .

Some varieties of Venetian also distinguish an ordinary vs. a weakened or lenited (&quot;evanescent&quot;) , which in some orthographic norms is indicated with the letter or ; in more conservative dialects, however, and are merged as ordinary . 
In those dialects that have both types, the precise phonetic realization of ⟨ł⟩ depends both on its phonological environment and on the dialect of the speaker. In Venice and its mainland as well as in most of central Veneto (excluding the peripheral provinces of Verona, Belluno and some islands of the lagoon) the realization is a non-syllabic (usually described as nearly like an &quot;e&quot; and so often spelled as ), when is adjacent (only) to back vowels (), vs. a null realization when is adjacent to a front vowel ().

In dialects further inland may be realized as a partially vocalised . Thus, for example, &#x27;gondola&#x27; may sound like , , or . In dialects having a null realization of intervocalic , although pairs of words such as , &quot;school&quot; and , &quot;broom&quot; are homophonous (both being pronounced ), they are still distinguished orthographically.

Venetian, like Spanish, does not have the geminate consonants characteristic of standard Italian, Tuscan, Neapolitan and other languages of southern Italy; thus Italian (&quot;slices&quot;), (&quot;ball&quot;) and (&quot;pen&quot;) correspond to , , and in Venetian. The masculine singular noun ending, corresponding to &quot;-o&quot;/&quot;-e&quot; in Italian, is often unpronounced in Venetian after continuants, particularly in rural varieties: Italian (&quot;full&quot;) corresponds to Venetian , Italian to Venetian . The extent to which final vowels are deleted varies by dialect: the central–southern varieties delete vowels only after , whereas the northern variety deletes vowels also after dental stops and velars; the eastern and western varieties are in between these two extremes.

The velar nasal (the final sound in English &quot;song&quot;) occurs frequently in Venetian. A word-final is always velarized, which is especially obvious in the pronunciation of many local Venetian surnames that end in , such as &quot;Marin and &quot;Manin , as well as in common Venetian words such as ( &quot;hand&quot;), ( &quot;fork&quot;). Moreover, Venetian always uses in consonant clusters that start with a nasal, whereas Italian only uses before velar stops: e.g. &quot;to sing&quot;, &quot;winter&quot;, &quot;to anoint&quot;, &quot;to cope with&quot;.

Speakers of Italian generally lack this sound and usually substitute a dental for final Venetian , changing for example to and to .

===Vowels===

An accented &quot;á&quot; is pronounced as [], (an intervocalic // could be pronounced as a [] sound).

==Prosody==

While written Venetian looks similar to Italian, it sounds very different, with a distinct lilting cadence, almost musical. Compared to Italian, in Venetian syllabic rhythms are more evenly timed, accents are less marked, but on the other hand tonal modulation is much wider and melodic curves are more intricate. Stressed and unstressed syllables sound almost the same; there are no long vowels, and there is no consonant lengthening. Compare the Italian sentence &quot;go there with him&quot; (all long/heavy syllables but final) with Venetian (all short/light syllables).

==Sample etymological lexicon==
As a direct descent of regional spoken Latin, Venetian lexicon derives its vocabulary substantially from Latin and (in more recent times) from Tuscan, so that most of its words are cognate with the corresponding words of Italian. Venetian includes however many words derived from other sources (such as ancient Venetic, Greek, Gothic, and German), and has preserved some Latin words not used to the same extent in Italian, resulting in many words that are not cognate with their equivalent words in Italian, such as:

==Spelling systems==
=== Modern script (GVIM-DECA) ===
Since December 2017 the Venetian language adopted a modern writing system, named GVIM (acronym for &quot;Grafia del Veneto Internazionale Moderno&quot;, i.e. &quot;Writing system for Modern International Venetian&quot;) thanks to the 2010 2nd Regional &quot;ad hoc&quot; Commission of the Regione del Veneto. The Academia de ła Bona Creansa – Academy of the Venetian Language, an NGO accredited according to the UNESCO 2003 Convention for the Venetian language and culture

 had already worked, tested, applied and certified a full writing system (presented in a scientific publication in linguistics
 in 2016), known with the DECA acronym (&quot;Drio El Costumar de l&#x27;Academia&quot;, i.e. literally &quot;According to the Use of the Academia&quot;).

The DECA writing system has been officialized by the Veneto Region under the name Grafia Veneta Internazionale Moderna, by unanimous vote of the &quot;Commissione Grafia e Toponomastica&quot;(i.e. &quot;Script and Topononymy Committee&quot; of the Venetian language on December 14, 2017, and available at portal of the Venetian Regional Council dedicated to the Venetian language.
The same writing system was then employed for the first grammar of the Venetian language to be published by a university, in Brasil, in 2018
The DECA, then GVIM, had already been used in a trilingual document approved by the &quot;Veneto Regional Council&quot; (Aprile 2016) in Italian, Venetian, and English.

===Traditional system===
Venetian currently has an official writing system. Traditionally it is written using the Latin script — sometimes with certain additional letters or diacritics. The basis for some of these conventions can be traced to Old Venetian, while others are modern innovations.

Medieval texts, written in Old Venetian, include the letters , and to represent sounds that do not exist or have a different distribution in Italian. Specifically:

* The letter was often employed in words that nowadays have a voiced -sound (compare English &quot;xylophone&quot;); for instance appears in words such as , , (&quot;reason&quot;, &quot;(holy) Cross&quot; and &quot;house&quot;). The precise phonetic value of in Old Venetian texts remains unknown, however.
* The letter often appeared in words that nowadays have a varying voiced pronunciation ranging from to or or even to ; even in contemporary spelling &quot;down&quot; may represent any of or even , depending on the dialect; similarly &quot;young woman&quot; could be any of , or , and &quot;zero&quot; could be , or .
* Likewise, was written for a voiceless sound which now varies, depending on the dialect spoken, from to to , as in for example &quot;sweet&quot;, now , &quot;sweetness&quot;, now , or &quot;hope&quot;, now .

The usage of letters in medieval and early modern texts was not, however, entirely consistent. In particular, as in other northern Italian languages, the letters and were often used interchangeably for both voiced and voiceless sounds. Differences between earlier and modern pronunciation, divergences in pronunciation within the modern Venetian-speaking region, differing attitudes about how closely to model spelling on Italian norms, as well as personal preferences, some of which reflect sub-regional identities, have all hindered the adoption of a single unified spelling system.

Nevertheless, in practice, most spelling conventions are the same as in Italian. In some early modern texts letter becomes limited to word-initial position, as in (&quot;is&quot;), where its use was unavoidable because Italian spelling cannot represent there. In between vowels, the distinction between and was ordinarily indicated by doubled for the former and single for the latter. For example, was used to represent (&quot;he/she kisses&quot;), whereas represented (&quot;low&quot;). (Before consonants there is no contrast between and , as in Italian, so a single is always used in this circumstance, it being understood that the will agree in voicing with the following consonant. For example, represents only , but represents .)

Traditionally the letter was ambiguous, having the same values as in Italian (both voiced and voiceless affricates and ). Nevertheless, in some books the two pronunciations are sometimes distinguished (in between vowels at least) by using doubled to indicate (or in some dialects ) but a single for (or , ).

In more recent practice the use of to represent , both in word-initial as well as in intervocalic contexts, has become increasingly common, but no entirely uniform convention has emerged for the representation of the voiced vs. voiceless affricates (or interdental fricatives), although a return to using and remains an option under consideration.

Regarding the spelling of the vowel sounds, because in Venetian, as in Italian, there is no contrast between tense and lax vowels in unstressed syllables, the orthographic grave and acute accents can be used to mark both stress and vowel quality at the same time: &quot;à&quot; , &quot;á&quot; , &quot;è&quot; , &quot;é&quot; , &quot;í&quot; , &quot;ò&quot; , &quot;ó&quot; , &quot;ú&quot; . Different orthographic norms prescribe slightly different rules for when stressed vowels must be written with accents or may be left unmarked, and no single system has been accepted by all speakers.

Venetian allows the consonant cluster (not present in Italian), which is sometimes written or before &quot;i&quot; or &quot;e&quot;, and or before other vowels. Examples include (Italian , &quot;to clear up&quot;), (, &quot;plain clear&quot;), (, &quot;gun&quot;) and (, &quot;[your] servant&quot;, , &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;goodbye&quot;). The hyphen or apostrophe is used because the combination is conventionally used for the sound, as in Italian spelling; e.g. (, &quot;stupid&quot;); whereas before &quot;a&quot;, &quot;o&quot; and &quot;u&quot; represents : (, &quot;box&quot;), (, &quot;to hide&quot;), (, &quot;to forgive&quot;).

===Proposed systems===
Recently there have been attempts to standardize and simplify the script by reusing older letters, e.g. by using for and a single for ; then one would write for (&quot;[third person singular] kisses&quot;) and for (&quot;low&quot;). Some authors have continued or resumed the use of , but only when the resulting word is not too different from the Italian orthography: in modern Venetian writings, it is then easier to find words as and , rather than and , even though all these four words display the same phonological variation in the position marked by the letter . Another recent convention is to use (in place of older ) for the &quot;soft&quot; &quot;l&quot;, to allow a more unified orthography for all variants of the language. However, in spite of their theoretical advantages, these proposals have not been very successful outside of academic circles, because of regional variations in pronunciation and incompatibility with existing literature.

More recently, on December 14, 2017, the Modern International Manual of Venetian Spelling was approved by the new Commission for Spelling of 2010. It was translated into three languages (Italian, Venetian and English) and it exemplifies and explains every single letter and every sound of the Venetian language. The graphic accentuation and punctuation systems are added as corollaries. Overall, the system was greatly simplified from previous ones to allow both Italian and foreign speakers to learn and understand the Venetian spelling and alphabet in a more straightforward way.

The Venetian speakers of Chipilo use a system based on Spanish orthography, even though it does not contain letters for and . The American linguist Carolyn McKay proposed a writing system for that variant based entirely on the Italian alphabet. However, the system was not very popular.

==Sample texts==
===Ruzante returning from war===
The following sample, in the old dialect of Padua, comes from a play by Ruzante (Angelo Beolco), titled (&quot;Dialogue of Ruzante who came from the battlefield&quot;, 1529). The character, a peasant returning home from the war, is expressing to his friend Menato his relief at being still alive:

The following sample is taken from the &quot;Perasto Speech&quot; (), given on August 23, 1797, at Perasto, by Venetian Captain Giuseppe Viscovich, at the last lowering of the flag of the Venetian Republic (nicknamed the &quot;Republic of Saint Mark&quot;).

===Francesco Artico===
The following is a contemporary text by Francesco Artico. The elderly narrator is recalling the church choir singers of his youth, who, needless to say, sang much better than those of today 
(see the full original text with audio):

== Miscellaneous ==

Due to the diacritic letter Ł being present in few languages besides Polish and Venetian, the latter of which does not have any official recognition by software producers like Microsoft and Apple, the Polish magazine KomputerSwiat noted that the Venice region has the highest usage of Polish keyboard settings outside of Poland on iPhones and Windows, although the same article found in an unrepresentative sample that when needing the letter without the keyboard, some Venetians google the Polish złoty or the exchange rate in order to copy-paste the letter.

==Venetian lexical exports to English==
Many words were exported to English, either directly or via Italian or French. The list below shows some examples of imported words, with the date of first appearance in English according to the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary.

<text>Leonard Percy de Wolfe Tilley (May 21, 1870 – December 26, 1947) was a New Brunswick lawyer, politician and the 21st premier of New Brunswick.

Tilley was born in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada the son of Samuel Leonard Tilley, one of the Fathers of Confederation, and Alice Starr (Chipman) Tilley (1844-1921). He grew up in Ottawa and Fredericton. Tilley was educated at the University of New Brunswick and then studied law at Dalhousie Law School. He articled in law with Sir Frederick Barker, was called to the bar in 1893 and set up practice in Saint John. He also served as a captain in the militia and was Chief Recruiting Officer for the province in 1914.

Tilley was elected to the provincial legislature in 1916 as a Conservative MLA and became a cabinet minister in 1925 under Premier John B. M. Baxter. In 1931 Baxter&#x27;s successor, Charles D. Richards made Tilley Minister of Lands and Mines, a position he held until succeeding Richards in 1933 as Premier. The Conservative government, despite two changes in premiers, was unable to deal with the Great Depression or maintain public confidence and Tilley&#x27;s government was defeated in the 1935 election.

During the federal Liberal-Conservative Party&#x27;s 1927 national convention in Winnipeg, Tilley was chosen to nominate R. B. Bennett as one of six leadership candidates. Bennett was an old friend with whom he had attended both elementary school and university. Tilley&#x27;s endorsement of Bennett was blunt and prescient: &quot;I nominate a gentleman whom, I believe, will be a winner.&quot; Bennett won the leadership race and became Prime Minister three years later. 

After leaving politics, Tilley became a county court judge for King and Albert Counties serving from 1935 to 1945. He also served as Admiralty Judge for New Brunswick.

Tilley died in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada at the age of 77.

<text>USS &quot;Brownson&quot; (DD-868) was a and the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for Rear Admiral Willard H. Brownson, USN (1845–1935).

== Design and launch ==
&quot;Brownson&quot; was designed by Gibbs and Cox, Naval Architects, New York office. Its keel was laid down by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation at Staten Island in New York on 13 February 1945; launched on 7 July 1945, sponsored by Ensign Caroline Brownson Hart, USNR, granddaughter of Admiral Brownson; and commissioned on 17 November 1945.

== Operations ==
&quot;Brownson&quot; conducted shakedown in the Atlantic and Caribbean and was then placed in a reduced operational status at Bath, Maine for six months. Resuming active operations in October 1946, she participated in Operation Highjump between November 1946 and April 1947. On 10 February 1947, a boat party attempted to make a landing in the Antarctic on Charcot Island but was unsuccessful because of heavy field ice within three miles of the coastline. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Aga-fA6iUm4&amp;pp=ygUTb3BlcmF0aW9uIGhpZ2gganVtcA%3D%3D

Brownson spent the summer and fall of 1947 operating out of Naval Station Newport, Rhode Island. In February 1948 she took part in the 2nd Fleet exercises in the Caribbean and then Joined the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. She returned to Newport in June 1948 and spent June 1948 to May 1949 conducting reserve cruises.

In May 1949 she entered Boston Naval Shipyard for an extensive modernization which lasted until March 1950. She conducted refresher training in the Caribbean and in the summer of 1950 made a Midshipman cruise in the Caribbean. She then participated in fleet exercises, operating out of Newport.

During night operations on Bermuda on 8 November 1950 &quot;Brownson&quot; collided with . She returned to Boston for repairs and further modernization. Leaving the yard in February 1951 she joined the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. The period between October 1951 and August 1952 was spent in the vicinity of Newport. In August 1952 she went to the North Atlantic with the 2nd Fleet for NATO&#x27;s Operation Mainbrace. In October 1952 she rejoined the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. Returning to Newport in February 1953, she operated along the Atlantic seaboard and in the Caribbean until August 1954, with the exception of one Midshipmen cruise and participation in Operation Springboard.

She departed Newport 2 August for an extended tour in the Far East with the 7th Fleet. In the Far East &quot;Brownson&quot; cruised in Japanese, Philippine, and Korean waters until January 1955. Departing the Far East she returned to the east coast, via the Suez Canal, arriving at Newport 14 March 1955.

== 1955–1976 ==

&quot;Brownson&quot; was fitted with a variable depth sonar receiver which could be lowered into the sea from a boom attached to the fantail of the ship. The purpose of the sonar pod was to detect submarines under a thermal layer which would hide their presence from a hulled placed sonar receiver. &quot;Brownson&quot; evaluated this sonar along the northern coastal area, where submarines could hide in trenches. In 1962 the ship transferred to Cuban waters during the period of tension that culminated in the Cuban quarantine (the Cuban Missile Crisis). &quot;Brownson&quot; returned to home port in November 1962, then entered a Boston shipyard to receive the FRAM I modification in 1962–63. This included removal of gun mount 52, where anti-submarine torpedo launchers were placed, with a DASH (Drone Antisubmarine Helicopter) deck/hangar added aft. The ship received ASROC among other upgrades. It returned from service in Vietnam via the Suez Canal in 1967. It was later modified in the Boston NSY in 1967 with a large, low frequency, rubberized, prototype sonar dome just forward of midships and a smaller sonar receiver, aft but also along the keel, to achieve &quot;3D&quot; sonar &quot;pictures&quot;. Later, in 1967 Sonarmen Paul Kronfield and Robert Devon reported for duty aboard Brownson. They later attended PAIR factory school conducted by Sperry Rand, the manufacturers of the new AN/SQQ-23X sonar. Brownson spent several years operating out of Newport with DESDEVGRU-2 (Destroyer Development Group Two) evaluating the sonar system. After a brief shipyard in Boston, the NIXIE anti torpedo system was installed and further tested at sea on multiple cruises. Brownson was required to operate during heavy storms to evaluate the new rubber dome under conditions of high sea states. It underwent REFTRA (Refresher Training) in Gitmo in winter 1971–72, joined the Sixth Fleet north of Egypt that spring, and participated in NATO fleet exercises.
