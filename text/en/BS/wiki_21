<text>United Nations Security Council Resolution 678 was adopted on 29 November 1990. After reaffirming resolutions 660, 661, 662, 664, 665, 666, 667, 669, 670, 674 and 677 (all 1990), the council noted that despite all the United Nations efforts, Iraq continued to defy the Security Council.

==Details==
The Security Council, invoking Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, offered Iraq one final chance to implement Resolution 660 (1990) which demanded that Iraq withdraw its forces unconditionally from Kuwait and return them to the positions in which they were located on 1 August 1990, the day before the invasion of Kuwait began.

Before the vote, United States lobbied states which had membership of the Council at the time, including the Soviet Union, China, Malaysia and Yemen, to support a resolution authorizing UN members states to use &quot;all necessary means&quot; for removing Iraqi forces from Kuwait. China, which had usually vetoed such resolutions authorizing action against a state, abstained in exchange for a promise from the US government that sanctions would be eased, and that the Chinese foreign minister would be received in the White House. States were offered economic incentives for &#x27;yes&#x27; votes, and those who initially opposed the resolution were discouraged from voting &#x27;no&#x27; by the threat of economic sanctions, particularly from the United States. The US successfully obtained a commitment from the Saudi government to provide $1 billion to the Soviets in aid through the winter.

On 29 November 1990, the Security Council passed Resolution 678 under the guidance of Canada, the USSR, United Kingdom and the United States, which gave Iraq until 15 January 1991 to withdraw from Kuwait and empowered states to use &quot;all necessary means&quot; to force Iraq out of Kuwait after the deadline. The Resolution requested Member States to keep the council informed on their decisions. This later became the legal authorization for the Gulf War, as Iraq did not withdraw by the deadline.

Resolution 678 was adopted by 12 votes with two opposing (Cuba and Yemen) and one abstention (China).

Cuba had voted for or abstained on previous resolutions relating to the Iraqi invasion, but did not support Resolution 678 because of its authorization of &quot;all necessary means.&quot;

After Yemen voted against the resolution, the US, World Bank and International Monetary Fund halted aid programs to Yemen, and Saudi Arabia expelled Yemeni workers. US diplomats told Yemeni officials it &quot;was the most expensive no vote you ever cast&quot;—referring to ceasing more than $70 million of US government foreign aid to Yemen.

==Criticism==
Burns Weston, a professor of international law at Iowa University, argued that Resolution 678 set a &quot;dubious precedent&quot; by backing away from the &quot;peaceful and humanitarian purposes and principles&quot; enshrined in the United Nations Charter. Weston said it did this by failing to vest in the UN the responsibility and accountability for the military force that was deployed to the region, but instead allowing the United States to manage it.

<doc id="539489" wikidata="Q804208" url="?curid=539489" title="Bajrakli Mosque, Belgrade">
<text>The Bajrakli Mosque (; named in Turkish as &quot;Bayraklı&quot;, &quot;bayrak&quot; is Turkish for &quot;flag&quot; and &quot;Bayraklı&quot; means &quot;with flag&quot;) is a mosque in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. It is located in Gospodar Jevremova Street in the neighbourhood of Dorćol. It was built around 1575, and is the only mosque in the city out of the 273 that had existed during the time of the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s rule of Serbia.

During the occupation of Serbia by the Austrians (between 1717 and 1739), it was converted into a Roman Catholic church; but after the Ottomans retook Belgrade, it was returned to its original function.

It was damaged after being set on fire on the eighteenth of March 2004, during that year&#x27;s unrest in Kosovo, in violent protest to the burning of Serbian churches in Kosovo, but it was later repaired.

== History ==

Out of the former more than 200 mosques and many small Islamic places of worship, the so-called mesdzid, the Bajrakli Mosque in 11, Gospodar Jevremova Street is the only remaining and active example of Islamic religious architecture in Belgrade. It is situated on a slope towards the Danube River, near the junction with Kralja Petra Street. It once dominated in the atmosphere of mostly ground floor houses in the busy commercial and craft town district of Belgrade, the so-called Zerek.

Descriptions of Belgrade of the 17th century were preserved by Ottoman travel writer Evliya Çelebi in which he vividly described the appearance of the town in the period of Turkish rule, with various buildings of Islamic architecture. In the second half of the 19th century, the Bajrakli Mosque was described by historians and travel writers Konstantin Jireček, Giuseppe Barbanti Brodano, as well as by archaeologist and ethnologist Felix Kanitz. It is assumed that today&#x27;s Bajrakli Mosque was built on the place of an older mesdzid, probably in the second half of the 17th century, as the endowment of the Ottoman ruler Sultan Suleiman II (1687—1691). It was originally named after former renewers, Čohadži-Hajji Alija&#x27;s and later Hussein Ćehaja&#x27;s mosque, while the current name was given in the late 18th or in the early 19th century. In it, as in the main mosque, there was the muwaqqit, the man who calculated the exact time of AH according to the Islamic calendar (which began in 622, i.e. in the year of Hijrah, the year during which the flight of the Prophet Muhammad from Mecca to Medina) occurred to determine sacred days, regulated clock mechanism and put the flag on the minaret, to signal the simultaneous beginning of the prayer to other Islamic places of worship in the town of Belgrade. Between 1717 and 1739, during the Austrian rule, it served as a Catholic cathedral, but its original function was renewed in 1741 when the Ottomans returned to Belgrade. The mosque was renewed in the 19th century by the rulers of the Obrenovic dynasty, Prince Mihailo and King Aleksandar Obrenović.

In 1868, the Minister of Education and Church Affairs was ordered by Prince Mihailo Obrenovic to choose one of the existing mosques and enable it for the performance of Muslim religious rites. Besides the mosque, the courtyard building next to it was also repaired. The Minister of Education and Church Affairs sent a document to the State Council of the Principality of Serbia, dated May 10, 1868, with the following content: &quot;In order for Mohammedans, who are on their business in Belgrade, not to be without religious consolation, His Excellency ordered the one of the local mosques to be repaired for their place of worship. Due to this high order, Bajrak mosque was chosen as the most appropriate one and the Minister of Construction as at my request sent the professional people to examine the same mosque, and a house next to it, where the mullahs will reside...&quot;

By the Decree of Prince Mihailo Obrenović from May 1868, the Minister of Education and Church Affairs was authorized to &quot;give to khoja 240, and a muezzin 120 talirs a year&quot;, and the servants of the mosque had even income from real estate - waqf property. The first imam and the muezzin at the Bajrakli Mosque were appointed in 1868.

Between the two world wars, the mosque was restored even by the Municipality of Belgrade, when in 1935 it was protected for the first time by the Regulation on the Protection of Antiquities in Belgrade. The restoration was performed several times and after the Second World War by the National Committee of the City of Belgrade and by the Cultural Heritage Preservation and Scientific Research Institute and, from the mid 1960s even by the Cultural Heritage Preservation Institute of Belgrade. After the recent damage in 2004, conservation works on rehabilitation and restoration of stone facades with the restoration of window openings were carried out.

== Architecture ==

The architecture of the mosque belongs to the type of one-storey cubic building with a dome and minaret. With massive walls and small openings, it was built of stone, and some segments were carried out in brick and stone. The building has the square plan, while the octagonal dome is supported by domed arches and niches -trompes, with modest decoration of consoles. The number of windows on the facades is uneven, while the one is located on each side of the tambour of the dome. Dome supporting elements and all the openings on the building end in characteristic arches. The minaret - a thin tower with conical roof, with a circular terrace at the top, from which the faithful are called to prayer by the muezzin - is located on the northwest exterior side. Opposite the entrance, in the interior of the mosque, there is the most sacred space - the mihrab, a shallow niche with elaborate vault decoration, set in the direction of the holy city of Mecca to the southeast, while the raised wooden pulpit, mimbar, is set to the right of the mihrab, in the south-west corner. Above the entrance, there is a wooden gallery (mahfil) from which one can come to the serefa, terrace on the minaret.

The interior decoration of the mosque is very modest. The walls are without plaster with shallow moldings, rare stylized floral and geometrical motifs and calligraphic inscriptions of verses from the Quran, then with the names of the first caliphs, as well as of Allah&#x27;s magnificent properties and names written in Arabic letters on a specially decorated carved panels. At the entrance to the mosque there was an arched arcade porch with three small domes. There is a fountain for prayer washing in the yard, as well as uncompleted religious school (madrassa) with the library. The Bajrakli Mosque is the main Islamic cultural center in Belgrade. Today is a bit hidden in the environment of higher housing units in Gospodar Jevremova Street.

Because of its antiquity, rarity, preservation of the original purpose, and representativeness of religious architecture and Islamic culture, in 1946 was placed under state protection as a cultural monument, and in 1979 was declared a cultural monument of great value (Decision, &quot;Official Gazette of SRS&quot; No. 14/79).

<text>In Greek mythology, Pallas (/ˈpæləs/; Ancient Greek: Πάλλας) was a member of the Athenian royal family.

== Family ==
Pallas was one of the four sons of the exiled King Pandion II of Athens and Pylia, daughter of King Pylas of Megara. He was the brother of Aegeus, Nisos, Lykos and the wife of Sciron.

== Mythology ==
Upon the death of Pandion, Pallas and his brothers took control of Athens from Metion, who had seized the throne from Pandion. They divided the government in four but Aegeas became king. Pallas received Paralia or Diacria as his domain, or else he shared the power over several demes with Aegeus. Later, after the death of Aegeas, Pallas tried to take the throne from the rightful heir, his nephew, Theseus, but failed and was killed by him, and so were his fifty children, the Pallantides.

In a version endorsed by Servius, Pallas was not a brother, but a son of Aegeus, and thus a brother of Theseus, by whom he was expelled from Attica. He then came to Arcadia, where he became king and founded a dynasty to which Evander and another Pallas belonged.

<text>The green-billed coucal (Centropus chlororhynchos) is a member of the cuckoos. It is endemic to Sri Lanka&#x27;s wet zone and listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, as the small population declined due to forest destruction and fragmentation.
It inhabits the tall rainforests of southwest Sri Lanka and nests in bushes. Its typical clutch is 2–3 eggs.

==Description==
It is a medium to large bird at 43 cm. Its head and body is purple-black, the wings are maroon above and black below, and the long tail is dark green. The bill is a distinctive light green. Sexes are similar, but juveniles are duller and streaked. It is somewhat smaller and less contrasted than the more widespread greater coucal. Despite its size and distinctive call, this is a difficult species to see because of the dense habitat in which it lives and its retiring nature. It feeds on a wide range of insects, caterpillars and small vertebrates, but snails are a favourite.

==In culture==

In Sri Lanka, this bird is known as &quot;bata atti-kukula&quot; – or, &quot;wal atti-kukula&quot; in the Sinhala language. This bird appears in a 20 rupee Sri Lankan postal stamp.

<doc id="539532" wikidata="Q51611" url="?curid=539532" title="Trill consonant">
<text>In phonetics, a trill is a consonantal sound produced by vibrations between the active articulator and passive articulator. Standard Spanish as in , for example, is an alveolar trill.

A trill is made by the articulator being held in place and the airstream causing it to vibrate. Usually a trill vibrates for 2–3 contacts, but may be up to 5, or even more if geminate. However, trills may also be produced with only one contact. While single-contact trills are similar to taps and flaps, a tap or flap differs from a trill in that it is made by a muscular contraction rather than airstream. Individuals with ankyloglossia may have issues producing the trill sound.

== Phonemic trills ==
Trill consonants included in the International Phonetic Alphabet:
* – Voiced alveolar trill
* – Voiceless alveolar trill
* – Voiced bilabial trill
* – Voiceless bilabial trill 
* – Voiced retroflex trill 
* – Voiced uvular trill
* – Voiceless uvular trill
* – Voiced epiglottal trill
* – Voiceless epiglottal trill

In addition,
* – Velopharyngeal trill; the velopharyngeal fricative found in disordered speech sometimes involves trilling of the velopharyngeal port, producing a &#x27;snort&#x27;.

The bilabial trill is uncommon. The coronal trill is most frequently alveolar , but dental and postalveolar articulations and also occur. An alleged retroflex trill found in Toda has been transcribed (that is, the same as the retroflex flap), but might be less ambiguously written , as only the onset is retroflex, with the actual trill being alveolar. The epiglottal trills are identified by the IPA as fricatives, with the trilling assumed to be allophonic. However, analyzing the sounds as trills may be more economical. There are also so-called strident vowels which are accompanied by epiglottal trill.

The cells in the IPA chart for the velar, (upper) pharyngeal, and glottal places of articulation are shaded as impossible. The glottis quite readily vibrates, but this occurs as the phonation of vowels and consonants, not as a consonant of its own. Dorso-palatal and velar vibratory motions of the tongue are occasionally produced, especially during the release of dorsal stops, and &quot;ingressive&quot; velar trills occur in snoring, but not in normal speech. The upper pharyngeal tract cannot reliably produce a trill, but the epiglottis does, and epiglottal trills are pharyngeal in the broad sense. A partially devoiced uvular or pre-uvular (i.e. between velar and uvular) trill with some frication occurs as a coda allophone of in the Limburgish dialects of Maastricht and Weert.

Voiceless trills occur phonemically in e.g. Welsh and Icelandic. (See also voiceless alveolar trill, voiceless retroflex trill, voiceless uvular trill.) Mangbetu and Ninde have phonemically voiceless bilabial trills.

The Czech language has two contrastive alveolar trills, one a fricative trill (written &quot;ř&quot; in the orthography). In the fricative trill the tongue is raised, so that there is audible frication during the trill, sounding a little like a simultaneous and (or and when devoiced). A symbol for this sound, , has been dropped from the IPA, and it is now generally transcribed as a raised &quot;r&quot;, .

Liangshan Yi (&quot;Cool Mountain&quot; Yi) has two &quot;buzzed&quot; or fricative vowels (written &quot;ṳ, i̤&quot;) which may also be trilled, .

A number of languages have trilled affricates such as and . The Chapakuran language Wariʼ and the Muran language Pirahã have a very unusual trilled phoneme, a voiceless bilabially post-trilled dental stop, .

A nasal trill has been described from some dialects of Romanian, and is posited as an intermediate historical step in rhotacism. However, the phonetic variation of the sound is considerable, and it is not clear how frequently it is actually trilled. Some languages contrast /r, r̃/ like Toro-tegu Dogon and Inor.

== Extralinguistic trills ==
A linguolabial trill is not known to be used phonemically but occurs when blowing a raspberry.

Snoring typically consists of vibration of the uvula and the soft palate (velum), which may be described as an ingressive velic trill. Like the uvular trill, the ingressive velic trill does not involve the tongue; it is the velum that passively vibrates in the airstream. The &quot;Speculative Grammarian&quot; has proposed a jocular symbol for the sound (and also the sound used to imitate a pig&#x27;s snort), a wide O with a double dot (Ꙫ), suggesting a pig&#x27;s snout. The Extensions to the IPA identifies an egressive fricative pronounced with this same configuration, common with a cleft palate, as velopharyngeal , and with accompanying uvular trill as () or ().

Lateral trills are also possible and may be pronounced by initiating or with an especially forceful airflow. There is no symbol for them in the IPA. Lateral coronal trills are sometimes used to imitate bird calls, and are a component of Donald Duck talk. A labiodental trill, , is most likely to be lateral, but laterality is not distinctive among labial sounds.

Ejective trills are not known from any language although they are easy to produce. They may occur as mimesis of a cat&#x27;s purr.

<text>Nutri-Grain is a brand of breakfast cereal and breakfast bar made by Kellanova since 1976. In Australia and New Zealand Nutri-Grain is a breakfast cereal made from corn, oats, and wheat. The pieces are shaped like bricks.

In the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Ireland, the Nutri-Grain name is used for soft breakfast bars.

==History==

The breakfast cereal in its original &quot;block and hole&quot; shape was introduced in Australia in 1976, and later in 1981 consisting of flakes without added sugar. There were four varieties initially (rye, corn, barley, and wheat); later these were reduced to corn and wheat, and finally the corn line was completely discontinued. There are various Nutri-Grain Bars made from the breakfast cereal bonded together, available in the markets where the cereal is available. The bars became popular in the 1990s as an &quot;on-the-go&quot; food.

In 2013, Nutri-Grain breakfast drinks were added to the line of cereals for the Australian market.

==UK and Ireland products==
In the UK, Nutri-Grain bars are around one-third cereals (mainly wheat-flour) and around ten percent fruit. Breakfast bars are a similar product to the muesli bar or granola bar.

<doc id="539539" wikidata="Q5159008" url="?curid=539539" title="Concordia University System">
<text>The Concordia University System (CUS) is an organization of five colleges and universities and one satellite campus in the United States that are operated by the Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod (LCMS). All of the institutions are named &quot;Concordia&quot;—a reference to the Latin title of &quot;The Book of Concord&quot;, the collection of Lutheran confessions—and all include professional church work programs as part of their curricula. The CUS was formed in 1992. In 2011, 28,421 students attend Concordia University System institutions. In 2021, the official website for the system claimed an enrollment of over 35,000 students.

Each Concordia except the one in Ann Arbor, Michigan, is independent and has its own president, faculty, and board of regents; Concordia University Ann Arbor is now a satellite campus of Concordia University Wisconsin. At the same time, the schools interact with one another and share some resources and services. One service offered by the CUS, the Simultaneous Enrollment Program, allows any student enrolled at one Concordia to attend another CUS college for up to a year as a &quot;visiting student&quot;. During that time, visiting students are considered to be enrolled at both CUS institutions simultaneously.

The 2019 convention of the LCMS passed Resolution 7-03 to create a new governance model for the schools. In February 2021, a committee appointed by the synod&#x27;s board of directors tentatively proposed a new model under which each school&#x27;s board of regents and administration would be responsible for its own property and business matters, while the CUS would be replaced with a Commission on University Education which would govern the &quot;ecclesiastical functions and connections of the schools&quot; and would establish &quot;ecclesiastical accreditation process&quot;. The plan is not complete and the committee is receiving comments from interested parties in the LCMS.

==Campuses==
The six campuses in the Concordia University System are:
*Concordia University Ann Arbor in Ann Arbor, Michigan - A branch campus of Concordia University Wisconsin since 2013
*Concordia University Chicago in River Forest, Illinois
*Concordia University Irvine in Irvine, California
*Concordia University, Saint Paul in Saint Paul, Minnesota
*Concordia University, Nebraska in Seward, Nebraska
*Concordia University Wisconsin in Mequon, Wisconsin

Several former members of CUS have closed: Concordia College Alabama, in Selma, Alabama, closed in 2018; Concordia University in Portland, Oregon, closed in 2020; and Concordia College–New York in Bronxville, New York, closed in 2021. Concordia University Texas in Austin, Texas was part of the system, but filed for a governance independent of CUS and the LCMS and had declined to seat regents elected at the 2023 LCMS convention. , the university is in a legal dispute with the LCMS over ownership and accountability of the institution and is not considered to be a CUS or LCMS school while the court case is unsettled.

==Non-member institutions==
There are several educational institutions named &quot;Concordia&quot; that are not part of the Concordia University System. For example, neither of the LCMS seminaries (Concordia Seminary and Concordia Theological Seminary) are part of CUS. The non-accredited Concordia College and University is in no way affiliated with the Concordia University System or its seven campuses.

The educational institutions of the Lutheran Church–Canada are not part of the CUS even though that church body was originally part of the LCMS and remains associated with it. Those institutions are Concordia Lutheran Seminary in Edmonton, and Concordia Lutheran Theological Seminary in St. Catharines. Concordia University of Edmonton was founded as a Lutheran institution, but has since secularized.

Other Concordias that are affiliated with neither the CUS nor the LCMS include Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, and Concordia University in Montreal.

<text>Congressional Debate (also known as Student Congress, Legislative Debate) is a competitive interscholastic high school debate event in the United States. The National Speech and Debate Association (NSDA), National Catholic Forensic League (NCFL) and many state associations and national invitational tournaments offer Congressional Debate as an event. Each organization and tournament offers its own rules, although the National Speech and Debate Association has championed standardization since 2007, when it began to ask its districts to use one of a number of procedures for qualification to its National Tournament.

In Congressional Debate, high school students emulate members of the United States Congress by debating pieces of legislation, including bills and resolutions. Before the event, each school submits mock legislation to each tournament. After the legislation has been compiled, it is distributed to each participating team. Each team attempts to research as many topics as possible, with each participant choosing to stand in affirmation or negation of the legislation being debated.

== Legislation ==
Unlike other debate events, students drive the topics for discussion by drafting their own legislation for submission to tournaments. The bills and resolutions must be national in scope, and must either fall within jurisdiction for lawmaking by the United States Congress as a bill, or express a specific position and/or recommendation for further action outside of Congress&#x27; jurisdiction as a resolution. A popular type of resolution is to propose amendments to the United States Constitution, which requires action by state legislatures.

Tournaments may review legislation submitted before sharing the overall docket with all participating schools. Contestants from each school research and prepare arguments both in favor and against each legislation in the docket before arriving at the tournament. It is important that this happens.

== Chambers and Sessions ==
Students attending each tournament are divided up into sections of 10-30 (usually 15–20, the NSDA recommendation is 18). These individual rooms are called chambers, and sometimes labeled as a &quot;House&quot;, or &quot;Senate,&quot; depending on the region and the tournament.

During each phase of a tournament (preliminary and elimination), there is at least one round, often referred to as a &quot;session.&quot; The National Speech and Debate Association defines a session as having:
* Ten minutes of time allocated for each student (average is three hours for 18-20 contestants)
* Election of a presiding officer
* New seating chart (necessary accommodations for students with special needs may be made)
* Resetting of precedence/recency
* New legislation that has not been debated in a previous session at that tournament
* The same contestants stay in one chamber, until the tournament advances to the next level of elimination.

While larger tournaments may have preliminary rounds that precede elimination rounds (semifinals, finals, etc.), smaller tournaments may not have elimination rounds and may recognize and award students in individual chambers.

=== Setting the Agenda ===
Rounds usually begin with a method for determining which bills will be debated and in which order, referred to as the docket. This most commonly happens with a nominated docket at the tournament, although some areas have a system of informal caucusing or highly organized committees, which convene to review legislation that has been subdivided by the tournament to address a specific topic area, such as is done in the National Catholic Forensic League. A common committee structure includes: &quot;Public welfare&quot;, &quot;Economics,&quot; and &quot;Foreign Affairs.&quot;

=== Speeches ===
Congressional Debate speeches last up to three minutes (with a 10-second grace period). The first speech on each legislation, known as the &quot;authorship&quot;, goes to the person who wrote the legislation, or from the same school of the author. (However, many tournaments use legislation from the NSDA, in which case anyone can give the authorship.) If nobody from the author&#x27;s school is present, another debater gives a sponsorship speech (sometimes called the first affirmative), which is functionally identical to an authorship. This first speech is followed by a two-minute questioning period. One three-minute speech in opposition (negation) follows it, with another mandatory two minutes of questioning. After these initial speeches, debate alternates in favor and opposition to the legislation with three-minute speeches and one minute of questioning. Within each speech, contestants develop two or three organized, logical arguments supported by credible evidence for why the chamber should vote for or against the given legislation. The general format of a speech is as follows:
# Introduction: Usually, speeches begin with some sort of attention-getting device, such as a quotation (which could be humorous, shocking, or sad) or statistic. The introduction is tied to the central thesis of the speech, as the speaker urges the chamber to vote in support or opposition. Sometimes, the two or three main lines of argument are previewed to give the audience an idea of where the speech is leading; however, some criticize this practice as a waste of limited time.
# Contentions: Two or three arguments for or against the legislation. Each contention is explained in the speaker&#x27;s own words and supported by evidence from reputable and relevant sources.
# Conclusion: The speaker often restates his 2 or 3 contentions and returns to the attention-getting device from the introduction to give the speech thematic unity. Alternatively, conclusions can consist of merely 1 or 2 sentences, such as &quot;For these reasons you must pass/defeat this bill/resolution/legislation.&quot;

==== Questioning ====
Questioning, traditionally, has been the standard set by the debate rules. One speaker at a time has an opportunity to ask one question at a time, moderated by the presiding officer. Typically, questions attempt to expose faults in the speech given. Sometimes speakers upholding the same side as the current speaker will ask a &quot;friendly question,&quot; seeking agreement, although in some regions, this is discouraged. Questions, and their respective answers, are to be short and to the point, as delays will unfairly cut into other speakers&#x27; questioning time.

Rules do not allow for &quot;prefacing,&quot; where students formulate a statement or argument as part of their question; rather, they must simply ask a question, and only a question, however this rule may not be present at some tournaments.

The debate rules also provides for direct questioning, if the standing rules of the organization allow for it, where the speaker and questioner can engage in direct dialogue without moderation from the chair. This is done in 30- or 60-second blocks of time, allowing the questioner to engage the floor speaker to greater depth. This is used to sometimes build arguments that the questioner uses in a later speech, similar to cross-examination in other competitive debate events. At tournaments where this is practiced, the presiding officer is either required or strongly advised to keep a separate questioning priority, to ensure equal opportunity for questioners. Several tournaments have piloted this method since the National Speech and Debate Association suggested this as a result of discussions with its Congressional Debate Rules and Recommendations Committee in 2009.

Some leagues and tournaments still use a protocol where the balanced of unused speaking time is reserved for questioning, rather than having a specific period.

While some student questioners feel the need to ask if the speaker yields, this is unnecessary under procedure, because the standing rules of the organizations and tournaments provide specific parameters for questioning periods that already establish when questioning begins.

== Procedure and Presiding Officers ==
While all Congressional Debate competition rely upon parliamentary procedure as practiced in Congress (i.e. the Standing Rules of the United States Senate or the Procedures of the United States House of Representatives) as the underpinning for how sessions are conducted, there may be slight variations in how the competition itself is run. Each chamber has a presiding officer (PO) or chair. At the beginning of each session, contestants in the chamber nominate candidates. Usually, each nominee gives a brief candidacy speech introducing themselves and stating their qualifications. Contestants then elect a presiding officer by majority via individual, secret balloting.

The presiding officer&#x27;s job is to facilitate fair, balanced, and efficient debate during the session in which they have been elected, primarily through recognition of speakers and questioners (see section below). At the end of many tournaments students in the chamber vote on which presiding officer was the best, and some tournaments have a separate means for judge recognition of presiding officers.

The most common duties of the presiding officer are:
* recognizing speakers
* recognizing contestants to ask questions of speakers
* recognizing contestants to move motions
* timing speeches (often done with an audible gavel signal)
* conducting votes on motions, including legislation
* keeping order in the chamber

=== Speaker Recognition ===
The presiding officer always calls for an author or sponsor for the first legislation in order, and the author always gets first right of refusal. When a session starts, there usually are not predetermined methods for selecting contestants for their first speech. Once speakers have been recognized, the universal rule in all leagues and tournaments is to first recognize those who have not spoken, or those who have spoken least (referred to as &quot;precedence&quot;). Beyond that, the National Forensic League and common practice have dictated that students also consider who spoke earlier (referred to as &quot;recency&quot;). Before precedence and recency are established, the presiding officer must recognize speakers fairly and equitably. The National Forensic League and many tournaments have (as of 2012) ruled the use of methods that tie the number of questions asked or motions made to speaker recognition, as well as how many times a student has stood, out of order, because they result in competitors simply &quot;playing the game&quot;.

Often, coaches will instruct students who preside to call on contestants for early speeches that they do not know, and/or who are less experienced. Additionally, since debate becomes more complex after more arguments have been introduced, later speakers bear a higher burden for clash and refutation.

In some areas, before precedence and recency are established, priority cards are distributed or numbers are designated to each student, giving the presiding officer a clear and objective directive as to whom to recognize. This has been criticized by longtime National Forensic League Congress Coordinator Harold Keller for entirely removing the dynamism of the activity from students&#x27; hands.

=== Motions ===

The National Forensic League&#x27;s Table of Parliamentary Motions is in use by almost every organization that conducts Congressional Debate competition, including the National Catholic Forensic League. The motions are similar, if not usually identical to those used in Congress with a few exceptions, including the one-thirds second required to amend a motion or legislation, to prevent abuse of that protocol.

The presiding officer never should call for motions; rather, contestants should rise and say &quot;motion,&quot; and then that they move a specific motion.

==== Frequently Used Parliamentary Motions ====

The following motions are used at almost all Congressional Debate tournaments:

These motions are allowed at some Congressional Debate tournaments, depending on the region and the style of debate:

This requires a suspension of the rules.*

==== Main Motion ====
The term &quot;main motion&quot; refers to the primary question before the assembly; in Congressional Debate, this is the legislation as presented on the agenda, so it is never necessary for a contestant to specifically move the main motion. Main motions can be changed or affected by a variety of subsidiary motions.

The following motions end debate on the pending main motion:
* Previous question (ends debate and moves to voting on the legislation).
* Lay on the Table (pauses debate until a motion to take from the table passes).
* Recess (pauses debate for the specified duration of the recess, debate resumes automatically on return)
* Adjourn (ends debate on the pending item and any items left on the table; any item not passed automatically fails without a vote)

Only one main motion is in order at any given time. If the chamber wishes to change to another legislation while another is still being considered, the chamber must end debate (which could include pausing debate by laying on the table) before changing to the desired item. Some tournaments establish a minimum time before the previous question can be moved; others limit how long each legislation may be debated. When debate gets one-sided, or &quot;stale,&quot; often a contestant will rise and move the previous question, which requires two-thirds of the chamber concurring. If this motion fails, the presiding officer would rule any immediate subsequent motion to &quot;lay on the table&quot; (requiring a simple majority vote) out of order, since that is an abusive way to circumvent the spirit of the rules to allow the minority a voice before majority rules.

==== Voting ====
After the previous question has been moved, the presiding officer calls for a vote on the legislation, and after counting votes, announces whether the ayes or noes have it, and the motion carries or is defeated. Note that &quot;yay&quot; and &quot;nay&quot; are archaic modes of voting expression that are no longer used in parliamentary parlance.

It is commonplace for students to move a recess following voting.

==== Amendments ====
Amendments are an important tool that can add nuance and perspective to debate on a particular issue, even though they are not practiced as often as they once were. To amend, a student will submit the amendment in writing to the head table (often rising to a point of personal privilege and seeking permission to approach the rostrum). The presiding officer (often in consultation with the parliamentarian) will first determine if the amendment is germane; or if it changes the original intent of the legislation, it is ruled dilatory. The author of the amendment then moves to amend, and if the presiding officer rules it germane, they read it aloud to the chamber and calls for a one-thirds second (usually by voice vote). If one-third of the chamber concurs to consider the amendment, the presiding officer then calls for a speech in support of the amendment. At most tournaments, the speech introducing or sponsoring the amendment is not guaranteed to its author, and in fact, it is common practice in some areas for a contestant to immediately move the previous question on the amendment. If that happens, it is not debated before the chamber passes or defeats the amendment. If the amendment passes, subsequent debate on the legislation must consider the legislation as amended.

== Judging ==

Judges either serve as a scorers or parliamentarians. Scorers judge individual sessions.
# Evaluate individual speeches, awarding speaker points (usually on a 1-6 scale)
# Evaluate the presiding officer, awarding speaker points (usually on a 1-6 scale)
# Holistically rank the judge&#x27;s eight most preferred contestants, considering the presiding officer for inclusion or exclusion among those eight.

=== Evaluating Speeches ===
While judging a speech is clearly, to a certain extent, subjective, there are certain key standards that distinguish effectiveness:
* Originality of Thought: advances debate rather than repeats previously stated ideas; refutes opposing arguments.
* Organization and Unity: cohesively links ideas.
* Evidence and Logic: cites credible sources, connecting to claims.
* Delivery: extemporaneous speaking vs. reciting a manuscript, seriousness of purpose, style and poise.
* Questioning: how well the debater defends her/his position and claims made.

=== Evaluating Presiding Officers ===
The presiding officer always is taken into consideration for recognition in the chamber by judges (usually through ranking at the end of the session), and some tournaments have both the scorers and parliamentarian evaluate the presiding officer, while others just have one or the other do so. The following key standards distinguish effectiveness:
* Parliamentary Procedure: clearly explains protocols and procedures.
* Recognition: fairly and efficiently recognizes speakers and questioners, maintains appropriate speaker precedence and recency, and avoids &quot;activity,&quot; &quot;longest standing/standing time.&quot;
* Control: maintains decorum of delegates, and willing to rule motions out of order.
* Demeanor: fosters a respectful, professional, and collegial atmosphere.
* Communication: overall use of language, avoiding unnecessary verbiage.

=== Parliamentarian ===
In addition to judges who score speeches, most tournaments have a parliamentarian in each chamber. Unlike scorers, who generally rotate each session, the parliamentarian remains in one chamber for all sessions (preliminary, semifinal or final). The parliamentarian&#x27;s role is a fairly passive one; their main purpose is to serve as a reference on parliamentary procedure in case there is confusion or a dispute the presiding officer cannot resolve. Unless either the presiding officer makes (or fails to correct) a major error in procedure or else the debate gets bogged down the parliamentarian will generally not intervene in the proceedings unless asked by someone in the chamber.

== History ==
The first high school Congress was held in 1938 by the National Forensic League. Like other forms of debate, it emphasizes clash of ideas, and consideration of questions of policy (bills) and value (resolutions). It operates like a forensic speech event with sectioning of multiple entries per section and comparative ranking and rating by points (as opposed to pairing just two entries and wins/losses). Since 2000, the event has been growing nationwide, added by several states as State Tournament event, and added to numerous large invitational tournaments.

=== National Trends ===
In the past decade, Congressional Debate has spread widely across the debate community. The first major tournament outside of NFL and NCFL nationals to hold Congressional Debate was the Harvard University Tournament traditionally held near President&#x27;s Day weekend in February. Other major tournaments which host congress competitions include The Barkley Forum for High Schools at Emory University, The University of Florida Blue Key, Yale, Princeton, the Villiger tournament in Philadelphia, the Glenbrooks tournament in Chicago, the Crestiann Classic in Florida, Pennsbury, Princeton, George Mason, the Minneapple Debate Tournament in Minnesota, Stanford, the California Invitational at UC Berkeley, the Sunvitational in Florida, and Nova Titan Invitational in Florida. In addition, Congress is now one of the official events at the debate Tournament of Champions, hosted by the University of Kentucky. Students who achieve a high level of competitive success at other national tournaments qualify to compete at the TOC, which brings together some of the best congresspersons from across the nation. The nomenclature of &quot;congressional debate&quot; is also the result of a shift in recent times toward a more debate-oriented category. In the past, the category focused more on simulating the Congress through oratory skills, hence the name &quot;student congress.&quot; The trend is to strike a balance between eloquent speech and reasoned debate.

<doc id="539543" wikidata="Q7959835" url="?curid=539543" title="Wahoos (University of Virginia)">
<text>Wahoos, often shortened to &#x27;Hoos, is a nickname for sports teams of the University of Virginia (officially the Cavaliers), and more generally, a nickname for University students and alumni.

== Origins ==
The nickname is a back-formation from the school&#x27;s yell, &quot;wa-hoo-wa.&quot;

Official University of Virginia sports documents explain that Washington and Lee baseball fans first called University of Virginia players &quot;a bunch of rowdy Wahoos,&quot; and used the &quot;Wahoowa&quot; yell as a form of derision during the in-state baseball rivalry in the 1890s, presumably after hearing them yell or sing &quot;wa-hoo-wa.&quot; The term &quot;Wahoos&quot; spread around the University and was commonly in use by the 1940s. &quot;&#x27;Hoos&quot; emerged as an equally commonly accepted nickname at the university and in student publications. Although the terms “Cavaliers,” “Wahoos” and “‘Hoos” are used almost interchangeably to refer to University teams and players, “Cavaliers” is more often used by the media, while “Wahoos” and “‘Hoos” are frequently used by Virginia students and fans. 

The yell was invented as an Indian yell for Dartmouth College by Dartmouth student Daniel Rollins in 1878. &quot;Corks &amp; Curls&quot;, the University of Virginia annual, regularly printed lists of the yells and colors of the various colleges; in 1888 it included Dartmouth&#x27;s school yell, a part of which was the phrase &quot;wa-hoo-wa.&quot; University of Virginia students soon incorporated the phrase &quot;wa-hoo-wa&quot; into their own, longer school yell, and individual U.Va. fraternities also adopted it and modified it. It was common for such student culture to travel: the University of Illinois also adopted &quot;wa-hoo-wa.&quot; Dartmouth students, meanwhile, largely stopped using the Indian yell during the 1980s along with the accompanying Indian mascots, symbols, and nickname.

The yell was already in use by the time Nathalie Floyd Otey performed at the Levy Opera House in Charlottesville on January 30, 1893. She sang a song specifically about the town and University titled &quot;Wa-Hoo-Wa&quot; that began, &quot;Oh, Charlottesville, illustrious name,/ The home of Jefferson you claim;/ The lap of learning, font of fame—&quot; and was set to the tune of &quot;Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay,&quot; with the catchy chorus sung as &quot;Wa-hoo-wa you-vee-ay.&quot; Otey&#x27;s song was popular enough with students that &quot;Corks &amp; Curls&quot; printed it in 1894. Legend, however, states that Otey sang &quot;Where&#x27;er You Are, There Shall My Love Be&quot;. The student audience decided to join in the refrain of the song and by the end of the play the crowd turned the words &quot;Where&#x27;er You Are&quot; into &quot;Wah Hoo Wah.&quot; Both events might have occurred, since an enthusiastic student audience might reasonably be presumed to sing along with Otey after hearing her sing &quot;Wah-Hoo-Wah.&quot;

While there is no evidence that the nickname stems from the wahoo fish, it is often claimed by students that a &quot;wahoo is a type of bass fish that is capable [of] drinking twice its weight.&quot;

== The Good Old Song ==

The &quot;wah-hoo-wah&quot; yell is memorialized in The Good Old Song, the de facto alma mater of the University of Virginia written in the mid-1890s, which describes &quot;the good old song of Wah-Hoo-Wah.&quot; The song is sung by the spectators at Virginia football games after a score.

<doc id="539554" wikidata="Q749711" url="?curid=539554" title="Senegal coucal">
<text>The Senegal coucal (Centropus senegalensis) is a member of the cuckoo order of birds, the Cuculiformes, which also includes the roadrunners, the anis, and the hoatzin. It is a medium-sized member of its genus and is found in lightly-wooded country and savannah in central and southern Africa.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760, the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description and an illustration of the Senegal coucal in the fourth volume of his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen collected in Senegal. He used the French name &quot;Le coucou de Sénégal&quot; and the Latin name &quot;Cuculus Senegalensis&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766, the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot;. One of these was the Senegal coucal. Linnaeus included a terse description, coined the binomial name &quot;Cuculus senegalensis&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work. The Senegal coucal is now one of around 30 species placed in the genus &quot;Centropus&quot; that was introduced in 1811 by the German zoologist Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;kentron&quot; meaning &quot;spur&quot; or &quot;spike&quot; with &quot;pous&quot; meaning &quot;foot&quot;.

Three subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;C. s. aegyptius&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1788) – northeast Egypt
* &quot;C. s. senegalensis&quot; (Linnaeus, 1766) – Senegal and Gambia to Eritrea south to northwest Angola, south-central DR Congo and Uganda
* &quot;C. s. flecki&quot; Reichenow, 1893 – east Angola to northeast Namibia and southwest Tanzania south to Malawi and Zimbabwe

==Description==
This is a medium-sized species at in length. Its crown, nape and upper parts, bill, legs and long tail are black, the eyes are red, the wings are chestnut, and the underparts are creamy white, with blackish barring on the flanks. The sexes are similar, but juveniles are browner and more heavily barred above, with buff to cinnamon, barred and streaked underparts.

==Distribution and habitat==
It is a widespread species distributed through much of central and southern Africa south of the Sahara Desert. The range extends from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia and Kenya in the east, and Angola and Congo to the south. A separate population in southern Africa is centred on Zambia, Zimbabwe and northern Botswana. The Senegal coucal is a bird of grassy habitats with trees, such as bushes and savannah.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The Senegal coucal takes a wide range of insects, caterpillars and small vertebrates. It occasionally eats other food items. It nests off the ground in low vegetation, and the typical clutch is two to four eggs laid in a large nest built from stalks and leaves.

==Status==
This is an abundant species, which advertises its presence with a loud &quot;ook-ook-ook&quot; call. It has a very wide range and no particular threats have been identified so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

<text>The Quillen–Suslin theorem, also known as Serre&#x27;s problem or Serre&#x27;s conjecture, is a theorem in commutative algebra concerning the relationship between free modules and projective modules over polynomial rings. In the geometric setting it is a statement about the triviality of vector bundles on affine space.

The theorem states that every finitely generated projective module over a polynomial ring is free.

==History==
===Background===
Geometrically, finitely generated projective modules over the ring formula_1 correspond to vector bundles over affine space formula_2, where free modules correspond to trivial vector bundles. This correspondence (from modules to (algebraic) vector bundles) is given by the &#x27;globalisation&#x27; or &#x27;twiddlification&#x27; functor, sending formula_3 (Hartshorne II.5, page 110). Affine space is topologically contractible, so it admits no non-trivial topological vector bundles. A simple argument using the exponential exact sequence and the d-bar Poincaré lemma shows that it also admits no non-trivial holomorphic vector bundles.

Jean-Pierre Serre, in his 1955 paper &quot;Faisceaux algébriques cohérents&quot;, remarked that the corresponding question was not known for algebraic vector bundles: &quot;It is not known whether there exist projective &quot;A&quot;-modules of finite type which are not free.&quot; Here formula_4 is a polynomial ring over a field, that is, formula_4 = formula_6.

To Serre&#x27;s dismay, this problem quickly became known as Serre&#x27;s conjecture. (Serre wrote, &quot;I objected as often as I could [to the name].&quot;) The statement does not immediately follow from the proofs given in the topological or holomorphic case. These cases only guarantee that there is a continuous or holomorphic trivialization, not an algebraic trivialization.

Serre made some progress towards a solution in 1957 when he proved that every finitely generated projective module over a polynomial ring over a field was stably free, meaning that after forming its direct sum with a finitely generated free module, it became free. The problem remained open until 1976, when Daniel Quillen and Andrei Suslin independently proved the result. Quillen was awarded the Fields Medal in 1978 in part for his proof of the Serre conjecture. Leonid Vaseršteĭn later gave a simpler and much shorter proof of the theorem, which can be found in Serge Lang&#x27;s &quot;Algebra&quot;.

==Generalization==
A generalization relating projective modules over regular Noetherian rings &quot;A&quot; and their polynomial rings is known as the Bass–Quillen conjecture.

Note that although formula_7-bundles on affine space are all trivial, this is not true for &quot;G&quot;-bundles where &quot;G&quot; is a general reductive algebraic group.

<doc id="539566" wikidata="Q156711" url="?curid=539566" title="Uzhhorod">
<text>Uzhhorod (, ; , ; ) is a city and municipality on the Uzh River in western Ukraine, at the border with Slovakia and near the border with Hungary. The city is approximately equidistant from the Baltic, the Adriatic and the Black Sea (650–690 km) making it the most inland city in this part of Europe. It is the administrative center of Zakarpattia Oblast (region), as well as the administrative center of Uzhhorod Raion (district) within the oblast. Population: 

==Name==
The city&#x27;s earliest known name is &quot;Ungvár&quot;, from Hungarian &quot;Ung&quot; (River Uzh) and &quot;vár&quot; &quot;castle, fortress&quot;, originally referring to a castle outside the city (probably Nevytske Castle).

The name &quot;Uzhhorod&quot; was coined in early 19th century Slavophile circles as a literal translation of the name &quot;Ungvár&quot;. The city officially adopted this name some time after 1920, under Czechoslovak administration.

The names of the city also include: (before 1996); , (historically); ; ; , ; ; ; ; ; .

==History==

===Early history===

==== White-Croat Ungvar (677) ====

The city was founded by early Slavs, one tribe of whom was the White Croats, who settled the area of the modern Uzhhorod under Kuber in the second half of the first millennium AD.Warriors from Ukraine established the Ungvar fortress in 677 according to the Chronicon Pictum. The settlement was the center of a new Slavic principality headed by a dynasty descended from Porga&#x27;s nephew Kubrat. In the 9th century, the fortified castle changed into a fortified early feudal town-settlement which according to Gesta Hungarorum was originally subject to the Old Bulgarian Prince Salan until falling to Laborec, a ruler who was loyal to Great Moravia.

==== Magyar conquest (895) ====
Almos&#x27;s Magyars who had arrived in the region from Kyiv stormed the Hunguar fortress in 895 AD. Having taken over the castle, Almos appointed his son Árpád as prince of Hunguaria and from Ungvar his warriors were called Hungarians. As this may be viewed as naive folk etymology by a medieval writer, for further information on the ethnonym of the Hungarians see the article Name of Hungary.

In the Kingdom of Hungary, the small town began to extend its borders. King Saint Stephen made it the centre (castrum) of Ung county with a strong military presence to protect the north east border of Hungary. In 1241–1242 the Mongols of Batu Khan burnt the settlement. After, in 1248 the city was granted town privileges by the King Béla IV of Hungary. In the early 14th century, Uzhhorod was involved in the civil wars in the interregnum between Hungarian barons when the dynasty of Árpád died out. Finally Charles I of Hungary from the Anjou dynasty, descendant of the House of Árpád by his mother occupied the throne. The Anjou House also ruled the Kingdom of Naples and the Hungarian king Charles I invited the Drugeths (Italian counts from the Kingdom of Naples) into Hungary and gave the town to them. The Drugeth family became a member of the Hungarian nobility. During that period Philip Drugeth built Uzhhorod Castle. Together with the castle, the city began to grow. From 1430, Uzhhorod became a free royal town.

===Under Habsburg rule===
During the 16–17th centuries The Kingdom of Hungary fell into three parts. The middle was occupied by the Ottoman Empire, the north west was ruled by the Habsburg dynasty, the eastern part became the Principality of Transylvania, that hold the independent Hungarian statehood. During this period there were many handicraft corporations in Uzhhorod. In this period the city was engaged in the religious and political fight between primarily Hungarian Protestant Transylvania and the German Catholic Austria. Each one wanted to reunite the Kingdom of Hungary under their rule. In 1646 the Union of Ungvár was proclaimed and the Greek-Catholic church was established, in a ceremony held in the Ungvár castle by the Vatican Aegis. In 1707 Ungvár was the residence of Ferenc II Rákóczi, leader of the national liberation war of Hungarians against Habsburgs. From 1780 the city became the capital of the Greek Catholic Eparchy and from 1776 the center of a newly created school district.

The beginning of the 19th century was characterized by economic changes, including the first factories in the city. The greatest influence on Ungvár among the political events of the 19th century was made by the Hungarian Revolution of 1848-1849, during which the native Hungarian nobility sought both to shake off the suzerainty of the Austrian Empire and to have authority over their own people. 27 March 1848 was officially celebrated in the city as the overthrow of the monarchy in Hungary. It is now celebrated in Hungary on 15 March.

In 1872 the first railway line opened, linking the city to the important railway junction of Chop, then known as Csap.

According to the 1910 census, the city had 16,919 inhabitants, of which 13,590 (80.3%) were Magyars, 1,219 (7.2%) Slovaks, 1,151 (6.8%) Germans, 641 (3.8%) Rusyns and 1.6% Czechs. By religion, 5,481 Roman Catholic, 5,305 Jewish, 4,473 Greek Catholic, 1,368 Calvinist. At the same time, the municipal area of the city had a population composed of 10,541 (39.05%) Hungarians, 9,908 (36.71%) Slovaks, and 5,520 (20.45%) Rusyns.

===During the World Wars===
The First World War slowed down the tempo of city development. On 10 September 1919, Subcarpathia was officially allocated to the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Uzhhorod became the administrative center of the territory. During these years Uzhhorod developed into an architecturally modern city, with Malyi Galagov, a new government quarter, being built from scratch.

After the First Vienna Award in 1938, Uzhhorod was given back to Hungary from which it was separated after World War I.

In 1941 the Jewish population reached 9,576. On 19 March 1944, German troops entered the city. They established a &quot;Judenrat&quot; (Jewish council) and set up two ghettos, at the Moskovitz brickyard and Gluck lumberyard. During May 1944, all Jews were deported to Auschwitz in five different transports and subsequently murdered. Only a few hundred Jews survived.

===In the Soviet Union===
On 27 October 1944, the city was captured by the troops of the 4th Ukrainian Front of the Red Army.

This period brought significant changes. On the outskirts of Uzhhorod new enterprises were constructed and the old enterprises were renewed. On 29 June 1945, Subcarpathian Ukraine was annexed by the Soviet Union and became a westernmost part of the Ukrainian SSR. This followed the assumption of local authority by the People&#x27;s Committee of Transcarpathian Ukraine based in Uzhhorod and headed by a local Communist. That year the Uzhhorod State University (now Uzhhorod National University) was also opened. Since January 1946 Uzhhorod was the center of newly formed Zakarpatska oblast.

===In Ukraine===

Since 1991 Uzhhorod has been one of 24 regional capitals within independent Ukraine. Of these, Uzhhorod is the smallest and westernmost.

In 2002, a bust of Tomáš Masaryk, Czechoslovakia&#x27;s first president, was unveiled in a main square of the city. A similar bust was unveiled in 1928 on the 10th anniversary of Czechoslovak independence, but was removed by the Hungarians when they took over the region in 1939.

On 15 April 2022, as part of the derussification campaign that swept through Ukraine following the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Uzhhorod City Council decided to rename 58 streets connected to Russian figures. United States First Lady Jill Biden visited the city on 8 May 2022, which was not announced to the public until after the visit.

==Geography==

<doc id="539568" wikidata="Q921217" url="?curid=539568" title="El Mundo (Spain)">
<text>&#x27; (; ), before &#x27;, is the second largest printed daily newspaper in Spain. The paper is considered one of the country&#x27;s newspapers of record along with &quot;El País&quot; and &quot;ABC&quot;.

==History and profile==
 was first published on 23 October 1989. Perhaps the best known of its founders was Pedro J. Ramírez, who served as editor until 2014. Ramirez had risen to prominence as a journalist during the Spanish transition to democracy. The other founders, Alfonso de Salas, Balbino Fraga and Juan González, shared with Ramírez a background in Grupo 16, the publishers of the newspaper &quot;Diario 16&quot;. Alfonso de Salas, Juan Gonzales and Gregorio Pena also launched &quot;El Economista&quot; in 2006.

, along with &quot;Marca&quot; and &quot;Expansión&quot;, is controlled by the Italian publishing company RCS MediaGroup through its Spanish subsidiary company Unidad Editorial S.L. Its former owner was Unedisa which merged with Grupo Recoletos in 2007 to form Unidad Editorial, current owner of the paper.

The paper has its headquarters in Madrid, but maintains several news bureaus in other cities. The daily has a national edition and ten different regional editions, including those for Andalusia, Valencia, Castile and León, the Balearic Islands and Bilbao. It is published in tabloid format.

In 2005 started a supplement for women, &quot;Yo Dona&quot;, which was modelled on &quot;IO Donna&quot;, a supplement of the Italian daily &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;.

In January 2014 Pedro J. Ramírez, editor of the paper, was fired from his post. He argued that reporting on corruption scandals involving Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy led to his sacking. Casimiro García-Abadillo served as editor until April 2015, when he was replaced in turn by David Jiménez.

==Editorial stance==
Editorially, often expresses the mainstream views of the centre-right with independent and liberal overtones.

El Mundo defines its editorial line as liberal. It is usually critical of the left-wing and peripheral nationalisms. Its current ideology is secular center-right. Among its columnists there is a remarkable heterogeneity and eclecticism, often openly critical of the editorial line itself. At the time it was decisive in the fall of Felipe González.

According to its ideological principles, “it aspires to be a progressive newspaper, committed to defending the current democratic system, public freedoms and human rights included in the Universal Declaration promulgated by the UN and in the European Convention of Human Rights.&quot;

===Political impact===
 has played a key role in uncovering a number of scandals, among them embezzlement by the commander of the Guardia Civil, accusations of insider trading and tax fraud by the governor of the Central Bank of Spain and aspects of the Bárcenas affair. Investigative reporting by the staff of also revealed connections between the terrorist Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación (GAL) and the Socialist administration of Felipe González, revelations that contributed to his defeat in the 1996 elections.

In October 2005, revealed that Nazi Aribert Heim (aka &quot;Doctor Death&quot;) had been living in Spain for 20 years, probably with help from the ODESSA network, in collaboration with Otto Skorzeny, who had helped set up one of the most important ODESSA bases of operation in Spain, during the rule of Francisco Franco.

After the 11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings, the newspapers and &quot;La Razón&quot;, the regional television channel Telemadrid and the COPE radio network alleged that there had been inconsistencies in the explanations given by the Spanish judiciary about the bombings. Other Spanish media, such as &quot;El País&quot;, &quot;ABC&quot; and the Cadena SER radio network, accused and the other media of manipulation over this issue. The bombings and the results of the subsequent judicial inquiry are still debated in Spain today.

==Circulation==
The circulation of rose in the 1990s. It was
* 209,992 copies in 1993 
* 268,748 copies in 1994
*68,813 copies in 2020

In 2001 had a circulation of 291,000 copies and it was 312,366 copies next year. The paper had a circulation of 300,000 copies in 2003, making it the third best selling newspaper in the country.

Based on the findings of the European Business Readership Survey had 11,591 readers per issue in 2006. Its circulation between June 2006 and July 2007 was 337,172 copies. The 2007 circulation of the paper was 337,000 copies. It was 338,286 copies in 2008 and had 200,000 readers for the printed edition in 2009. The circulation of the paper was 266,294 copies in 2011. In April 2020 the newspaper had 51,526 readers of the printed edition.

Many online readers are in Latin America, and the website has an edition for the Americas. However, digital expansion has done little to offset the decline in revenues from Spanish advertisers since 2008.
The newspaper aims to increase digital profits via a subscription model. It launched a current affairs outlet only accessible to subscription customers, named ORBYT.

<text>White Butte is the highest natural point in the U.S. state of North Dakota. At an elevation of 3,506 ft (1,069 m), it is a prominent butte in Slope County, in the Badlands of the southwestern part of the state. It is located east of U.S. 85 and about south of Amidon.

The nearest town is Amidon, about seven miles to the northwest. The summit is located within the boundaries of the Little Missouri National Grassland and is about south of Theodore Roosevelt National Park. It is on private property, owned by the Dennis family who live nearby. At the parking area, one mile due north of the trailhead, the family maintains a small mailbox-like receptacle for donations to help maintain the area, and requests a $5 contribution from visitors. From the trailhead, the trail itself is a 4-mile round trip.

The Killdeer Mountains, to the north, rise roughly from their foothills, but are shorter than White Butte.

<doc id="539584" wikidata="Q2540426" url="?curid=539584" title="Roman Baths (Bath)">
<text>The Roman Baths are well-preserved &quot;thermae&quot; in the city of Bath, Somerset, England. A temple was constructed on the site between 60 and 70 AD in the first few decades of Roman Britain. Its presence led to the development of the small Roman urban settlement known as &quot;Aquae Sulis&quot; around the site. The Roman baths—designed for public bathing—were used until the end of Roman rule in Britain in the 5th century AD. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, the original Roman baths were in ruins a century later. The area around the natural springs was redeveloped several times during the Early and Late Middle Ages.

The Roman Baths are preserved in four main features: the Sacred Spring, the Roman Temple, the Roman Bath House, and a museum which holds artefacts from &quot;Aquae Sulis&quot;. However, all buildings at street level date from the 19th century. It is a major tourist attraction in the UK, and together with the Grand Pump Room, receives more than 1.3 million visitors annually. Visitors can tour the baths and museum but cannot enter the water.

==Hot spring==
The water is sourced from rainfall on the nearby Mendip Hills, which then percolates down through limestone aquifers to a depth of between . Geothermal energy raises the water temperature here to between . Under pressure, the heated water rises along fissures and faults in the limestone, until it bubbles up from the ground into the baths. This process is similar to an enhanced geothermal system, which also makes use of the high pressures and temperatures below the Earth&#x27;s crust. Hot water at a temperature of rises here at the rate of every day, from a geological fault (the Pennyquick fault). In 1982 a new spa water bore-hole was sunk, providing a clean and safe supply of spa water for drinking in the Pump Room.
===Water quality===
Bath was charged with responsibility for the hot springs in a Royal Charter of 1591 granted by Elizabeth I. This duty has now passed to Bath and North East Somerset Council, who monitor pressure, temperature and flow rates. The thermal waters contain sodium, calcium, chloride and sulphate ions in high concentrations.

The Roman Baths are no longer used for bathing. In October 1978, a young girl swimming in the restored Roman Bath with the Bath Dolphins, a local swimming club, contracted naegleriasis and died, leading to the closure of the bath for several years. Tests showed &quot;Naegleria fowleri&quot;, a deadly pathogen, in the water. The newly constructed Thermae Bath Spa nearby, and the refurbished Cross Bath, allow modern-day bathers to experience the waters via a series of more recently drilled boreholes.

Archaeological evidence indicates that the site of the baths may have been a centre of worship used by Celts; the springs were dedicated to the goddess Sulis, who was locally identified with Minerva. Geoffrey of Monmouth in his largely fictional describes how the spring was discovered by the pre-Roman British king Bladud, who built the baths there. Early in the 18th century Geoffrey&#x27;s obscure legend was given great prominence as a royal endorsement of the waters&#x27; qualities, with the embellishment that the spring had cured Bladud and his herd of pigs of leprosy through wallowing in the warm mud.

===Roman Britain===
The name Sulis continued to be used after the Roman invasion, leading to the town&#x27;s Roman name of &quot;Aquae Sulis&quot; (&quot;the waters of Sulis&quot;). The temple was constructed in 60–70 AD and the bathing complex was gradually built up over the next 300 years. During the Roman occupation of Britain, and possibly on the instructions of Emperor Claudius, engineers drove oak piles into the mud to provide a stable foundation and surrounded the spring with an irregular stone chamber lined with lead. In the 2nd century it was enclosed within a wooden barrel-vaulted building, and included the caldarium (hot bath), tepidarium (lukewarm bath), and frigidarium (cold bath). After the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the first decade of the 5th century, these fell into disrepair and were eventually lost due to silting up, and flooding. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; suggests the original Roman baths were destroyed in the 6th century.

About 130 curse tablets have been found. Many of the curses are related to thefts of clothes whilst the victim was bathing.

===Post-Roman use===
The baths have been modified on several occasions, including the 12th century, when John of Tours built a curative bath over the King&#x27;s Spring reservoir, and the 16th century, when the city corporation built a new bath (Queen&#x27;s Bath) to the south of the spring. Anne of Denmark came to Bath twice for her health. The court physician Théodore de Mayerne bathed Anne of Denmark in the King&#x27;s Bath on 19 May 1613. She returned in August 1615. Anne of Denmark was surprised by a flame caused by natural gas in King&#x27;s Bath, and thereafter used the New Bath or Queen&#x27;s Bath where a column with a crown and the inscription &quot;Anna Regnum Sacrum&quot; was added in her honour.

The spring is now housed in 18th-century buildings, designed by architects John Wood, the Elder and John Wood, the Younger, father and son. Visitors drank the waters in the Grand Pump Room, a Neoclassical salon which remains in use, both for taking the waters and for social functions. Victorian expansion of the baths complex followed the Neoclassical tradition established by the Woods. In 1810, the hot springs were thought to have failed and William Smith opened up the Hot Bath Spring to the bottom, where he found that the spring had not failed but had flowed into a new channel. Smith restored the water to its original course.

The visitor entrance is via an 1897 concert hall by J. M. Brydon. It is an eastward continuation of the Grand Pump Room, with a glass-domed centre and single-storey radiused corner. The Grand Pump Room was begun in 1789 by Thomas Baldwin. He resigned in 1791 and John Palmer continued the scheme through to completion in 1799. The elevation on to Abbey Church Yard has a centre piece of four engaged Corinthian columns with entablatures and pediment. It has been designated by Historic England as a grade I listed building. The north colonnade was also designed by Thomas Baldwin. The south colonnade is similar but had an upper floor added in the late 19th century. The museum and Queen&#x27;s Bath including the &quot;Bridge&quot; spanning York Street to the City Laundry were by Charles Edward Davis in 1889. It comprises a southward extension to the Grand Pump Room, within which some parts of the 17th-century Queen&#x27;s Bath remain.

==Museum==
The museum houses artefacts from the Roman period, including objects that were thrown into the Sacred Spring, presumably as offerings to the goddess. These include more than 12,000 Denarii coins, which is the largest collective votive deposit known from Britain. A gilt bronze head of the goddess Sulis Minerva, which was discovered nearby in 1727, is displayed.

The Bath Roman Temple stood on a podium more than two metres above the surrounding courtyard, approached by a flight of steps. On the approach there were four large, fluted Corinthian columns supporting a frieze and decorated pediment above. The pediment, parts of which are displayed in the museum, is the triangular ornamental section, wide and from the apex to the bottom, above the pillars on the front of the building. It featured the powerful central image of a possible &quot;Gorgon&quot; head glowering down from a height of on all who approached the temple.

The great head itself has snakes entwined within its beard, wings above its ears, beetling brows and a heavy moustache. Although there is some disagreement about what this really represents (as Gorgons are usually female), most scholars have converged toward viewing it as a deliberate syncretism of Minerva&#x27;s Gorgon attribute with the face of a local god who presided over the waters of the nearby sacred spring. The central head has also variously been interpreted as the image of a water god such as Oceanus, or a local Celtic god of the sun. Besides the Gorgon head, the pediment&#x27;s artistic motif has more recently also been compared to the Jupiter-Ammon &quot;clipei&quot; found throughout Roman fora and which sometimes depicted local river gods in Celtic provinces.

In early 2010 various stones on the pediment were conserved and rearranged. In 2016, planning permission was received for a new learning centre aimed at schoolchildren and linked to the baths by a tunnel. Funding is being sought from the Heritage Lottery Fund and, if successful, it is hoped the centre will open in 2019.

==Preservation==
The late 19th century carvings of Roman Emperors and Governors of Roman Britain on the terrace overlooking the Great Bath are particularly susceptible to the effect of acid rain and are protected with a wash of a sacrificial shelter coat every few years. Exhibits within the temple precincts are susceptible to warm air which had the effect of drawing corrosive salts out of the Roman stonework. To help reduce this, a new ventilation system was installed in 2006.

In 2009 a grant of £90,000 was made to Bath and North East Somerset Council to contribute towards the cost of re-developing displays and improving access to the Roman Baths, by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport/Wolfson Fund, which was established to promote improvements in Museums and Galleries in England. Subsequent grants have funded further work on the exhibition design and layout by London-based specialist firm, Event Communications.

<doc id="539585" wikidata="Q448789" url="?curid=539585" title="Alveolo-palatal consonant">
<text>In phonetics, alveolo-palatal (alveolopalatal, &quot;alveo-palatal&quot; or &quot;alveopalatal&quot;) consonants, sometimes synonymous with pre-palatal consonants, are intermediate in articulation between the coronal and dorsal consonants, or which have simultaneous alveolar and palatal articulation. In the official IPA chart, alveolo-palatals would appear between the retroflex and palatal consonants but for &quot;lack of space&quot;. Ladefoged and Maddieson characterize the alveolo-palatals as palatalized postalveolars (and thus as palato-alveolars), articulated with the blade of the tongue behind the alveolar ridge and the body of the tongue raised toward the palate, whereas Esling describes them as advanced palatals (pre-palatals), the furthest front of the dorsal consonants, articulated with the body of the tongue approaching the alveolar ridge. These descriptions are essentially equivalent, since the contact includes both the blade and body (but not the tip) of the tongue (see schematic at right). They are front enough that the fricatives and affricates are sibilants, the only sibilants among the dorsal consonants.

According to Daniel Recasens, alveolo-palatal consonants are realized through the formation of a simultaneous closure or constriction at the alveolar and palatal zones with a primary articulator which encompasses the blade and the tongue dorsum. Their place of articulation may include the postalveolar zone and the prepalate, but also a larger contact area extending towards the front alveolar zone and the back palate surface. The tongue tip is bent downwards and the tongue dorsum is raised and fronted during the production of these consonants.

== Sibilants ==
The alveolo-palatal sibilants are often used in varieties of Chinese such as Mandarin, Hakka, and Wu, as well as other East Asian languages such as Japanese and Korean, Tibeto-Burman such as Tibetan and Burmese as well as Tai languages such as Thai, Lao, Shan and Zhuang. Alveolo-palatal sibilants are also a feature of many Slavic languages, such as Polish, Russian, and Serbo-Croatian, and of Northwest Caucasian languages, such as Abkhaz and Ubykh. The alveolo-palatal consonants included in the International Phonetic Alphabet are:

The letters and are essentially equivalent to and . They are the sibilant homologues of the pre-palatal fricatives and .

== Stops, nasals, and liquids ==
Symbols for alveolo-palatal stops (), nasals () and liquids () are sometimes used in sinological circles (a circumflex accent is also sometimes seen), but they are not recognized by the IPA. 

In standard IPA, they can be transcribed or . An alternative transcription for the voiced alveolo-palatal stop and nasal is , but it is used only when cannot be displayed properly.

For example, the Polish nasal represented with the letter &quot;ń&quot; is a palatalized laminal alveolar nasal and thus often described as alveolo-palatal rather than palatal. The &quot;palatal&quot; consonants of Indigenous Australian languages are also often closer to alveolo-palatal in their articulation.

===Contrasting with palatovelar consonants===

In Migueleño Chiquitano, phoneme /ȶ/ contrasts with phoneme /c̠/; in the syllabic coda (or intervowel) position in conservative Irish, laminal alveolo-palatal phoneme /ṉʲ/ (termed &quot;fortis slender coronal nasal&quot;, orthographic example &quot;inn&quot;) contrasts with both dorsal palatal phoneme /ɲ/ (termed &quot;slender dorsal nasal&quot;, orthographic example &quot;ing&quot; or &quot;-nc-&quot;) and apical palatalized alveolar phoneme /nʲ/ (termed &quot;lenis slender coronal nasal&quot;, orthographic example &quot;in&quot;); while general Irish other than Munster Irish contrasts alveolo-palatal nasal only with palatal nasal. In both cases, the palatal consonants work as the palatalization of velar consonants while alveolo-palatal consonants work as the palatalization of alveolar consonants.

In some spoken Chinese varieties, such as the in , contrast the alveolo-palatal nasal with the palato-velar nasal. For example, the following contrasting pairs can be found in Luchuan Ngai.
Although a number of spoken Chinese varieties, such as standard Mandarin, also contrast EMC alveolo-palatal nasal with velar nasal of class III (palatalizing medial), most don&#x27;t contrast them in a way that alveolo-palatal differs from palatal. For example, in Hakka, alveolo-palatal nasal marginally contrasts with velar nasal under close front medials, but there is little sign of palatal contrasts. 

Thus most frequently, the Sinologist use of ȵ instead of ɲ is not to indicate a contrast, but to emphasize its primary allophone not to be the Turkish [ɲ], or to indicate its coronal origin or that it has evolved with other dorsal consonants which have become alveolopalatals, where ɲ is reserved for postpalatals evolved from dorsal consonants. However, since ȵ has also been unfortunately used by some for Meixian Hakka, the distinction of usage has become vague. ȶ, on the other hand, has retained its accurate usage representing phonemes in certain spoken Chinese in Hengyang and has never been applied on Hakka or on certain Mandarin in or near Shandong.

<text>Hans Wollschläger (17 March 1935, in Minden – 19 May 2007, in Bamberg) was a German writer, translator, historian, and editor of German literature.

==Biography==
Wollschläger is widely known as the translator of &quot;Ulysses&quot; by James Joyce, commissioned by Suhrkamp Verlag after the reputation of previous translations had been tarnished. His translation took on &quot;canonical and cult status&quot; for German readers of Joyce. He also translated the complete works of Edgar Allan Poe (together with Arno Schmidt), and novels by Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett. He was vice chairman of the &quot; Karl-May-Gesellschaft&quot; (&quot;Karl May society&quot;) and was one of the editors of the historical critical edition of this author.

He wrote several books of fiction and non-fiction, including a history of the Crusades which has a polemical aspect (at the close of the book he suggests the Catholic Church be declared a criminal organisation, and Pope Urban II as a mass murderer) but also contains excerpts from several Arabic sources never previously translated into German.

Originally Hans Wollschläger had studied music. He wrote three symphonies which have never been performed in public. He also worked on a performing edition of the draft of Gustav Mahler&#x27;s unfinished Tenth Symphony, which he never completed. However, under the influence of Erwin Ratz, Wollschläger came to the conclusion that an unfinished masterwork should not be touched, and publicly withdrew his edition in 1962.

<doc id="539597" wikidata="Q894087" url="?curid=539597" title="Borough of Harrogate">
<text>The Borough of Harrogate was a local government district with borough status in North Yorkshire, England, from 1974 to 2023. Its council was based in the town of Harrogate, but it also included surrounding settlements, including the cathedral city of Ripon, and almost all of the Nidderdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. At the 2011 Census, the borough had a population of 157,869. 

The borough was abolished on 31 March 2023, and its functions were transferred to the new unitary North Yorkshire Council on 1 April 2023.

== History ==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, as a merger of the Masham and Wath rural districts, and part of Thirsk, from the North Riding of Yorkshire, along with the boroughs of Harrogate and the city of Ripon, the Knaresborough urban district, Nidderdale Rural District, Ripon and Pateley Bridge Rural District, part of Wetherby Rural District and part of Wharfedale Rural District, all in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The district was abolished by Government reforms on 31 March 2023 after 49 years of existence.

The district was part of the Leeds City Region, and bordered seven other areas; the Craven, Richmondshire, Hambleton, Selby and York districts in North Yorkshire and the boroughs of Bradford and Leeds in West Yorkshire. It fell primarily within the HG, LS and YO postcode areas, while a small part of it was within the BD area.

It was the county&#x27;s fourth largest district, as well the seventh largest non-metropolitan district in England. It was previously the county&#x27;s second largest district until 1 April 1996, when the parishes of Nether Poppleton, Upper Poppleton, Hessay and Rufforth were transferred from the Borough of Harrogate to become part of the newly formed York unitary authority area. According to the 2001 census, these parishes had a population of 5,169.

=== Abolition ===
In July 2021 the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government announced that in April 2023, the non-metropolitan county would be reorganised into a unitary authority. Harrogate Borough Council was abolished on 31 March 2023 and its functions were transferred on 1 April 2023 to a new single authority for the non-metropolitan county of North Yorkshire.

==Politics==

Elections to the borough council were held in three out of every four years, with one third of the 54 seats on the council being elected at each election. After being under no overall control from the 2006 election, the Conservative party gained a majority at the 2010 election.

Following the 2016 United Kingdom local elections and subsequent by-elections, the political composition of Harrogate was as follows:


This was the last composition of the former 54 seat council, prior to boundary changes.

The composition of the new 40 seat council after boundary changes was as follows:

=== Parliamentary constituencies ===
The district was divided between three parliamentary constituencies: the whole of Harrogate and Knaresborough, the eastern part of Skipton and Ripon and the north western part of Selby and Ainsty.

<doc id="539600" wikidata="Q721386" url="?curid=539600" title="Don Imus">
<text>John Donald Imus Jr. ( ; July 23, 1940 – December 27, 2019), also known as Imus, was an American radio personality, television show host, recording artist, and author. His radio show &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot; was aired on various stations and digital platforms nationwide until 2018.

Imus began his first radio job at KUTY in Palmdale, California in 1968. Three years later, he landed the morning broadcast position at WNBC in New York City. He was fired from WNBC in 1977, worked for a year at WHK in Cleveland, and was rehired by WNBC in 1979. He remained at WNBC until it left the air in 1988, at which time his show moved to WFAN, which took over WNBC&#x27;s former frequency of 660 kHz. Howard Stern&#x27;s success with national syndication led &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot; to adopt the same model in 1993.

Imus was labeled a &quot;shock jock&quot; in his later career. He was fired by CBS Radio in April 2007 after describing the Rutgers University women&#x27;s basketball team as &quot;nappy-headed hos&quot;.

In January 2018, Cumulus Media told Imus that the company was going to stop paying him, and his final show aired on March 29, 2018. He died the following year of complications from lung disease.

==Early life==
Imus was born in Riverside, California, to a wealthy family, the son of John Donald Imus Sr. and Frances E. Imus ( Moore) who ran a ranch named The Willows near Kingman, Arizona. Imus claimed at one time to practice Judaism then later recanted, calling himself, &quot;spiritual.&quot; He had a younger brother, Fred Imus (1942–2011). Imus disliked school, moving &quot;from one hideous private school to another&quot; and described himself as a &quot;horrible adolescent&quot;. When he was 15, his parents divorced. His father died when Imus was 20.

In 1957, while living in Prescott, Arizona, Imus dropped out of high school and joined the United States Marine Corps at Base Camp Pendleton where he was stationed in an artillery unit before transferring to the Drum and Bugle Corps. He left the Marines with an honorable discharge, and secured work as a window dresser in San Bernardino, before he was fired for performing strip teases on the mannequins for passersby. Imus then moved to Hollywood with his brother in an attempt to find success as musicians and songwriters, but they struggled to get radio DJs to play their songs on the air. This left Imus homeless, resorting to sleeping in a laundry and hitchhiking back to Arizona. After dropping out of the University of the Pacific, Imus worked as a brakeman on the Southern Pacific Railroad and in a uranium mine in Arizona. He suffered a mining accident that broke both of his legs.

==Career==
===Early career===
In 1966, Imus enrolled at the Don Martin School of Radio and Television Arts and Sciences, in Hollywood, after seeing a newspaper advertisement; he was thrown out for being &quot;uncooperative&quot;, but studied enough to obtain a broadcasting license from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Upon winning a talent contest at Johnny Otis&#x27;s night club, he worked as a singer-songwriter, with Otis serving as his manager. After hearing a morning radio DJ at KUTY, in Palmdale, California, Imus went to the station and successfully persuaded the owner to hire him. He signed on the air on June 2, 1968. While at KUTY, Imus debuted his on-air character Billy Sol Hargis, a radio evangelist inspired by and named for preacher Billy James Hargis and businessman Billie Sol Estes. Imus was an instant success at the station; in two months, he had become number one in ratings for his time slot, and earned a &quot;Billboard&quot; Award for Air Personality of the Year in a medium-sized market.

Imus then had a brief tenure at KJOY in Stockton, California, from which he was fired due to an incident that some sources attributed to his Eldridge Cleaver look-a-like contest in which the winner would be incarcerated for a year. Other sources suggest the firing was because of his saying &quot;hell&quot; and multiple raunchy jokes on-air. Imus moved to KXOA in Sacramento, California, whose management team—including general manager Jack G. Thayer and program director John Lund—both left for identical positions at Cleveland station WGAR and took Imus with them. Thayer and Lund were hired by WGAR to revamp the station&#x27;s old-line middle of the road (MOR) format, and had Imus as the centerpiece for their new adult contemporary format that had been developed at KXOA. Imus&#x27;s tenure at WGAR lasted for less than 15 months but immediately showed success. The October/November 1970 Arbitron ratings listed Imus at number one in the 18–49 demo, ahead of WKYC&#x27;s Jim Runyon and WJW&#x27;s Ed Fisher; WGAR as a whole topped both the 25–34 and 25–49 demos. Imus was honored by &quot;Billboard&quot; as the number one radio personality for 1971, an honor he shared with KMPC&#x27;s Gary Owens.

&quot;Imus in the Morning&quot; was controversial and satirical, with Imus&#x27;s existing characters and comedy skits garnering immediate attention. One of his earliest on-air jokes involved promoting the 1958 Bobby Darin single &quot;Queen of the Hop&quot; as &quot;a WGAR exclusive&quot; and talking over it in the mode of a Top 40 DJ. Imus also became infamous for his series of prank calls, even dialing Ohio Attorney General William J. Brown&#x27;s publicly listed phone number and inviting him to &quot;join the swinging world of show biz&quot;. He once contacted an Ohio Bell phone operator to ask if she was married and if &quot;you mess around&quot;, prompting the phone company&#x27;s lawyers to contact the station. His most infamous prank call was to a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant claiming to be an Ohio National Guard official and ordered 4,000 hamburgers as lunch for the troops. While the phone call was entirely scripted by Imus and Lund (with Lund voicing the McDonald&#x27;s worker) the segment influenced a later FCC ruling that required all radio DJs to identify themselves when they make phone calls on the air. Imus also devoted one show to help a Yugoslavian immigrant find a bride in order to prevent his deportation after it was discovered he had entered the United States illegally. Meanwhile, Imus, Jack Thayer, and WGAR were hit with a defamation lawsuit by television meteorologist Robert Zames after Imus repeatedly questioned Zames&#x27;s sobriety and joked about it on-air.

===1971–1979: WNBC and WHK===
On December 2, 1971, less than three years into his radio career, Imus started his morning show at WNBC in New York City, with a $100,000 annual salary which was said to have been double his WGAR salary. On his second day, he overslept and missed the show. Imus was involved in various projects during his time at WNBC. In March 1973, he began a stand-up comedy and stage act called &quot;Imus in the Evening&quot;; his first shows were held at The Bitter End in New York City. On January 30, 1974 he appeared as himself (a patient at Hope Memorial with a broken leg from skiing while on vacation from his radio show) on the NBC-TV daytime soap opera &quot;The Doctors&quot;. By the early 1980s, he was earning as much as $10,000 a performance. Imus retired his stand-up in December 1985. He released three albums containing radio segments and songs: &quot;1200 Hamburgers to Go&quot; (1972), &quot;One Sacred Chicken to Go&quot; (1973), and &quot;This Honky&#x27;s Nuts&quot; (1974). The latter features material from his stand-up comedy at Jimmy&#x27;s Club in Manhattan.

Imus started to drink heavily during this period, which soon affected his working life. He started to miss work and became increasingly unmanageable. He missed 100 days of work in 1973. In August 1977, WNBC decided to reformat the station and let go of their on-air staff. Imus described himself as &quot;awful&quot; and &quot;a jerk&quot; during this time, and struggled to find a suitable job in New York City that satisfied his salary demands. He returned to Cleveland and began an afternoon drive show on WHK in 1978. He found the experience humiliating but took the job in order to earn money and &quot;get my act together&quot;. During this time, Imus recorded episodes of &quot;IMUS, plus...&quot;, a late-night talk show on WNEW-TV in New York.

===1979–1988: WNBC===
On September 3, 1979, Imus returned to the air in mornings at WNBC from 5:30 am. By this time, Imus had started to use cocaine; he quit in 1983. He continued to drink, and his on- and off-air behavior became erratic; he turned up for work without shoes and slept on park benches with large amounts of money in his pocket. By 1981, Imus and Charles McCord secured a deal with Paramount Pictures that involved the development of three screenplays, including work on &quot;Joy of Sex&quot;. In April 1981, Imus renewed his contract with WNBC with a five-year deal worth $500,000 a year with bonuses if he surpassed ratings targets. Following the addition of Howard Stern in afternoons in 1982, Imus and Stern began a longtime feud though both were paired on WNBC print and television advertisements.

In July 1981, Imus released his first book, &quot;God&#x27;s Other Son&quot;, a novel about the life of his on-air character Billy Sol Hargis that he wrote with McCord. It was republished in 1994 and spent seven weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; best seller list. By October 1981, Imus was the most popular radio DJ in the US, reaching 220,000 regular listeners and number one in 12 of 13 demographic categories. Other regular Imus characters included the supposed general manager &quot;Geraldo Santana Banana&quot; (played by doo-wop singer Larry Chance), and &quot;Moby Worm&quot;, a monstrous creature who devoured local schools (which was reported on the show&#x27;s &quot;breaking news updates&quot;).

Imus was also the utility announcer for Geraldo Rivera&#x27;s monthly TV series &quot;Good Night America&quot;, which aired as a recurring segment of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Entertainment&quot; program (1973–1976), and he was one of the inaugural video jockeys (VJ) for the launch of VH-1, sister cable channel to MTV, in 1985.

===1988–2007: WFAN and national syndication===
On October 7, 1988, after WNBC was sold to Emmis Broadcasting, the station permanently signed off the air to have WFAN, an all-sports station, move to the station&#x27;s signal. The entire station staff was let go except Imus and his radio show team, who stayed to become WFAN&#x27;s morning show.

In 1989, Imus signed a five-year deal to continue his show on WFAN. In April 1989, Imus was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame. Later in 1989, Imus accepted an invitation to become an honorary assistant coach for a basketball game between the Fordham Rams and La Salle Explorers the following January.

The show began syndication in June 1993 when it was simulcast on WEEI in Boston, followed by four other stations around the country. They began simulcasting on MSNBC in 1996.

Imus was instrumental in raising over $60 million for the Center for the Intrepid, a Texas rehabilitation facility for soldiers wounded in the Iraq War. The largest technological center of its kind in the country, it is designed to treat disabled veterans and help them with their transition back into the community. Imus also took on the cause of the living conditions at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, visiting wounded veterans at the hospital to boost morale. Imus&#x27;s reporting preceded several resignations, including that of Lieutenant General Kevin Kiley, then Army Surgeon General. Imus had earlier criticized Kiley&#x27;s personal fitness for military duty and dedication to wounded soldiers.

===2007–2018: WABC and retirement===
The program was heard on WABC starting on December 3, 2007. In 2018, Cumulus Media informed Imus that the company was going to stop paying him because of the bankruptcy reorganization that Cumulus was undergoing. The show aired its final episode on March 29, 2018.

==Controversies==
===Rutgers women&#x27;s basketball team===
On April 4, 2007, during an on-air discussion about the NCAA Women&#x27;s Basketball Championship, Imus characterized the largely black Rutgers University women&#x27;s basketball team as &quot;rough girls&quot; in a comment on the players&#x27; tattoos. His executive producer Bernard McGuirk responded by referring to them as &quot;hardcore hos&quot;. The discussion continued with Imus describing the women as &quot;nappy-headed hos&quot; and McGuirk remarking that the two teams looked like the &quot;jigaboos versus the wannabes&quot; as mentioned in Spike Lee&#x27;s film &quot;School Daze&quot;, apparently referring to the two teams&#x27; differing appearances.

In the immediate aftermath of the remarks, public outrage was directed at Imus and WFAN. Howard Stern discussed how he had heard Imus make racist comments that were directed at a black female co-worker while the two were working at WNBC. Management was aware of the comments at the time but had done nothing. Stern&#x27;s co-host Robin Quivers confirmed that assertion and added that she had once been the target of Imus&#x27;s racist remarks herself. Imus dismissed the controversy at first, calling the incident &quot;some idiot comment meant to be amusing&quot;. He also stated that &quot;nappy-headed hos&quot; is a term that rap artists use to refer to black women. He said:

In response to mounting public censure, Imus issued a statement of apology:
On April 9, Imus appeared on Al Sharpton&#x27;s syndicated radio talk show &quot;Keepin&#x27; It Real with Al Sharpton&quot; to address the controversy. Sharpton called the comments &quot;abominable&quot;, &quot;racist&quot;, and &quot;sexist&quot;, and repeated his earlier demand that Imus be fired. Imus said, &quot;Our agenda is to be funny and sometimes we go too far. And this time we went way too far. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve learned: that you can&#x27;t make fun of everybody, because some people don&#x27;t deserve it.&quot;

Imus was suspended soon after. Media commentators were divided on the suspension. On MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Scarborough Country&quot; on April 10, Pat Buchanan said Imus was &quot;a good guy&quot; who &quot;made a bad mistake and apologized for it&quot; and that the show should stay on the air. Comedian Bill Maher said that, if a comedian apologizes for stepping over a line, that should suffice. MSNBC media analyst Steve Adubato disagreed, saying that this incident was &quot;not isolated&quot;. Joe Klein made the same charge, referring to Imus&#x27;s comment about &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporter Gwen Ifill 14 years earlier being a &quot;cleaning lady&quot; as evidence of a pattern of offensive comments. On &quot;The View&quot;, Rosie O&#x27;Donnell spoke out in support of keeping Imus on the air on free speech grounds. Emil Steiner of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; argued that Sharpton used the issue to further divide America along racial lines.

The Rutgers basketball team held a news conference at which coach C. Vivian Stringer stated that the team would meet with Imus to discuss his comments. Several of the players expressed their outrage over his remarks. Team captain Essence Carson said that Imus&#x27;s remarks had &quot;stolen a moment of pure grace from us&quot;.

&quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; columnist Clarence Page had confronted Imus about his characterization of certain black athletes and got him to take a pledge to stop. After the Rutgers team incident, Page said that he would not appear on the show again and said of the original two-week suspension:

 CBS board member and former NAACP president Bruce S. Gordon said that Imus should not be allowed to come back even after the suspension, claiming that his remarks &quot;crossed the line, a very bright line that divides our country.&quot; 
President of NBC News Steve Capus announced on April 11, 2007, that MSNBC would no longer simulcast &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot;. The decision came on the same day that a few advertisers left Imus, and the network also said that employee concerns played a role. Capus said:

CBS Radio canceled &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot; the next day. CBS President and chief executive officer Leslie Moonves stated:

The day before, CBS chairman Sumner Redstone said that he trusted that Moonves would &quot;do the right thing&quot;, but he didn&#x27;t elaborate. Moonves had met with Sharpton and Jesse Jackson shortly before the announcement was made. Moonves said in an internal memo that employee concerns were a factor in the decision to cancel Imus&#x27;s show, but he also said that the decision was &quot;about a lot more than Imus.&quot; Moonves said that CBS had to take Imus off the air in order to change &quot;a culture that permits a certain level of objectionable expression that hurts and demeans a wide range of people.&quot;

General Motors (Imus&#x27;s biggest advertiser), Staples Inc., GlaxoSmithKline, Sprint Nextel, PetMeds, American Express, and Procter &amp; Gamble either pulled their ads outright or suspended advertising on Imus&#x27;s show to protest his remarks. Bigelow Tea Company expressed uncertainty about renewing their ads with Imus&#x27;s show.

Just hours after the announcement of his firing, Imus met with Stringer and her team at Drumthwacket, the New Jersey governor&#x27;s mansion. The three-hour meeting was arranged by Buster Soaries, the former New Jersey Secretary of State and Stringer&#x27;s pastor. New Jersey governor Jon Corzine planned to attend the meeting but was injured in a car accident on the way. Imus left without commenting, but Stringer said that the meeting went well. She later commented that they had accepted Imus&#x27;s apology because he came to the meeting &quot;in spite of the fact that he lost his job. So let&#x27;s give him credit for that.&quot; She also emphasized that the basketball team had not called for Imus to be fired.

Senator John Kerry criticized CBS for being too harsh. He said that a &quot;long suspension&quot; would be &quot;appropriate to pay a price on the airwaves but I&#x27;m not sure that it was appropriate to say you&#x27;re off forever.&quot;

====Subsequent litigation====
Imus hired prominent attorney Martin Garbus by May 2, 2007, to pursue a wrongful termination lawsuit against CBS for the remaining $40 million on his five-year contract. The contract contained a clause indicating that CBS hired and supported Imus to produce &quot;irreverent&quot; and &quot;controversial&quot; programming. CBS announced a settlement with Imus on his $40 million contract on August 14. Rutgers basketball player Kia Vaughn filed a suit that same day against Imus, NBC Universal, CBS Corporation, MSNBC, CBS Radio, Viacom, Westwood One Radio, and Bernard McGuirk, citing slander, libel, and defamation of character. She was the only player to pursue legal damages. Vaughn dropped the lawsuit on September 11, 2007, citing her desire to concentrate on her studies and basketball training.

====Return to radio and television====
On July 8, 2007, the &quot;Drudge Report&quot; indicated that Imus would return to the air before the 2008 presidential election. Imus reached a settlement with CBS Radio over his contract on August 14, leaving him free to pursue other media opportunities.

On November 1, Citadel announced that they had agreed to a multi-year syndication contract with Imus. The new &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot; program was distributed nationally by Citadel Media and based at Citadel-owned WABC in New York City beginning in December. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on November 14 that Imus had agreed to terms with cable network RFD-TV to air a video simulcast of the new radio program. Charles McCord and Bernard McGuirk joined him in the new version of the show, and he returned to the airwaves on ABC Radio and RFD-TV on December 3. Sharpton said in an interview, &quot;We&#x27;ll monitor him; I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m going to throw a banquet for him and say welcome home. He has the right to make a living, but because he has such a consistent pattern with this we are going to monitor him to make sure he doesn&#x27;t do it again.&quot; Jesse Jackson appeared on &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot; on April 4, 2008, to discuss the 40th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., a booking that would have seemed impossible nearly a year before, when Jackson joined 50 demonstrators in Chicago demanding that &quot;Imus must go&quot;, and many media commentators declared Imus&#x27;s &quot;rehabilitation&quot; complete.

In September 2008, Imus signed a multi-year deal with Fox Business Network to simulcast his radio show &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot;.

===Adam &quot;Pacman&quot; Jones controversy===
Controversy once again surrounded Imus when he made the following statements regarding the suspension of Cowboys&#x27; cornerback Adam Jones:

In response, Jones said, &quot;I&#x27;m truly upset about the comments. Obviously Mr. Imus has problems with blacks. I&#x27;m upset, and I hope the station he works for handles it accordingly. I will pray for him.&quot; Imus said that his comments were misinterpreted. &quot;I meant that he was being picked on because he&#x27;s black.&quot; WABC vice president Phil Boyce said that it was unlikely that disciplinary action would be pursued against Imus, and none was.

===Joe Barton===
For two weeks in fall 2006, Imus delivered ongoing &quot;rants&quot; against Texas Congressman Joe Barton, describing him as &quot;a lying fat little skunk from Texas&quot;, a &quot;pipsqueak&quot; and a &quot;coward and a crybaby&quot;. Imus also called Barton a &quot;congressional dirtbag&quot;, because Barton used his position as a committee chair to prevent passage of the Combating Autism Act, which would authorize funds for autism research. In the weeks before Congress recessed on September 29, 2006, Barton used his chairmanship to prevent the legislative proposal from coming to a vote in the House, rousing the ire of Imus and his wife, staunch supporters of autism research. The bill already had been passed unanimously by the Senate, but Barton opposed the Senate bill&#x27;s stipulation that Centers of Excellence in Environmental Health and Autism investigate &quot;a broad array of environmental factors that may have a possible role in autism spectrum disorders.&quot;

===Lawsuits===

Nichole Mallette sued Imus on November 29, 2004, for wrongful termination and defamation after a Thanksgiving 2003 incident in which she was allegedly fired from her position as nanny and escorted off his property at 4:15 am. Don and Deirdre Imus were allegedly upset over Mallette&#x27;s possession of a cap-gun and pocketknife on ranch property.

One of the doctors who worked at the Imus Ranch, Dr. Howard Allen Pearson, sued Imus for slander and civil assault on July 8, 2005. Dr. Pearson accused Imus of threatening him during a July 13, 2004, confrontation at the ranch, after a disagreement over how to care for one of the children at the ranch. Imus subsequently referred to Pearson several times on the air as &quot;an arrogant fucking doctor who doesn&#x27;t mind letting a child suffer.&quot; Pearson was a world-famous pediatric cancer specialist who was the former chairman of the pediatrics department of the Yale Medical School as well as a co-founder (with Paul Newman) of another facility for ill children, the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp. In late 2005, Imus expressed his grievances about the case on the record to journalist Buzz Bissinger, for a &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; article that was published in the February 2006 issue.

Longtime sports commentator Warner Wolf was fired in 2016, after ten years on the show, and Wolf subsequently sued Imus and various other parties in New York for age discrimination. Wolf was in his late 70s at the time. The suit was dismissed in 2019 on a technicality: when he was fired, Wolf was a Florida resident who had been doing his segments from a home studio. The Manhattan Supreme Court ruled that the State of New York had no jurisdiction over this matter, and an appellate court agreed.

===Defamatory speech===
Imus and his crew made offensive remarks both on and off the air. Some examples include:
* Imus said in 1984 concerning Howard Stern: &quot;yes, Howard&#x27;s a slut too, Lloyd. Plus a Jew bastard, and should be castrated, put in an oven.&quot; Stern played a clip of this interview in the news section of his November 5, 2007, show.
* Imus referred to black sports columnist Bill Rhoden as a &quot;&quot;The New York Times&quot; quota hire&quot;.
* In the course of a 1998 interview with Mike Wallace on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, Imus told a producer off-camera that McGuirk was hired to perform &quot;nigger jokes&quot;.
* Robin Quivers recounted that he called her a &quot;nigger&quot; to her face when she worked with him at WNBC and also called her a &quot;spearchucker&quot; on the air. Both Howard Stern and Quivers recalled when Imus called a black female co-worker, a secretary named Brenda, a &quot;nigger&quot; during their time at WNBC.
* Imus repeatedly referred to Arabs as &quot;ragheads&quot;.
* The show&#x27;s routines sometimes contained derogatory epithets for homosexuals, including &quot;faggot&quot; and various terms describing homosexuality.
* Imus referred to former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich as &quot;disgusting&quot; and a &quot;fat repulsive pig&quot;.

==Business interests==
Imus was also a part owner of Autobody Express stores with his late brother, Fred (who was a frequent caller to the radio show, commenting on NASCAR races, the NFL and related pop culture matters). The Autobody Express stores were located in Santa Fe, and inside the Mohegan Sun Native American Casino in Uncasville, Connecticut. In 2003, the company failed, and both stores closed.

Imus owned a small coffee and pastry store also located in the Mohegan Sun casino. The Autobody Express became Imus Ranch Foods, which offered its signature chips and salsa via online sales and in Northeastern stores, prior to the discontinuation of the Imus Ranch Foods line in 2014.

==Honors==
Imus won four Marconi Awards, three for Major Market Personality of the Year (1990, 1992 and 1997) and one for Network Syndicated Personality (1994).

He was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1989.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Imus was married twice. Around 1969, he married his first wife Harriet Showalter, who had two daughters from a previous marriage, Nadine and Toni; Imus adopted Showalter&#x27;s daughters. The couple had two daughters of their own, Ashley and Elizabeth. They divorced in 1979. Imus married Deirdre Coleman on December 17, 1994, and they stayed together until Imus&#x27;s death in 2019. Their son Frederick Wyatt was born in 1998. Imus adopted his sixth child, Zach, in the 2010s.

At the time of his death, Imus resided in Brenham, Texas, at a ranch he acquired in 2013. He moved there full-time in 2015, after ending his Fox Business television simulcast in New York and from there started broadcasting his show solely on radio with the cast members broadcasting from the WABC radio studios. His former waterfront mansion in Westport, Connecticut, was sold that same year for $14.4 million.

According to journalist Robert D. McFadden, Imus was admired for his private charity work. He raised millions for the rehabilitation of wounded veterans of the Iraq war, children with cancer, and siblings of victims of sudden infant death syndrome, who had spent summers since 1999 on his ranch near Ribera, New Mexico.

=== Imus Ranch ===
In 1999, Imus and Deirdre founded the Imus Ranch, a working cattle ranch near Ribera, New Mexico, southeast of Santa Fe, for children with cancer. The ranch was used as a tax deduction by Imus, and eventually, due to the personal use of the ranch by the Imus family, saw its property tax exemption reduced to 55%. The ranch was also criticized for the relatively high ratio of cost to each child served, which was over $25,000. The summer program serving children ended in 2014, following a rib injury Imus suffered in a fall from a horse.

In the three years from 2014 onward, the ranch reported losses on its Form 990, totaling nearly $3 million. The board members of the non-profit were Imus, his wife Deirdre, and Imus&#x27;s agents, Vincent and Robert Andrews.

In October 2014, the ranch was offered for sale with an asking price of $32 million. The ranch repeatedly failed to sell, leading Imus to put the property up for auction in May 2017. The ranch was sold to broadcaster Patrick Gottsch in April 2018, for $12.5 million. A spokesperson for Imus stated that the non-profit organization had not been active since 2014.

===Health and death===
During his early years broadcasting in New York City, Imus battled with alcoholism. In 1983, he was persuaded by Michael Lynne, then his lawyer, to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Imus attended meetings and ceased drinking in public, but continued to drink in private. On July 17, 1987, after a nine-day vodka binge, he attended rehabilitation at a Hanley-Hazelden treatment center in West Palm Beach, Florida, for six weeks and remained sober. By 1991, Imus had adopted a vegetarian diet.

In 2000, Imus suffered serious injuries after a fall from a horse at his ranch and broadcast several shows from a hospital. The injuries resulted in chronic breathing problems, especially at higher altitudes, which he spoke about on his program.

In March 2009, Imus was diagnosed with stage 2 prostate cancer. He was advised to have radiation treatments, but said he chose to treat the disease holistically.

Imus was hospitalized at Baylor Scott &amp; White Medical Center in College Station, Texas, on December 24, 2019. He died three days later, on December 27, at the age of 79, of complications from lung disease. In reporting his death, David Bauder of the Associated Press said, &quot;the quote that might best serve as Imus&#x27;s epitaph&quot; was the shock jock&#x27;s statement to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine in 2006: &quot;I talk to millions of people every day. I just like it when they can&#x27;t talk back.&quot;

<text>In the localised Celtic polytheism practised in Great Britain, Sulis was a deity worshiped at the thermal spring of Bath. She was worshiped by the Romano-British as Sulis Minerva, whose votive objects and inscribed lead tablets suggest that she was conceived of both as a nourishing, life-giving mother goddess and as an effective agent of curses invoked by her votaries.

==Etymology==
The exact meaning of the name &quot;Sulis&quot; has been a matter of debate, but an emerging consensus among linguists regards the name as cognate with Old Irish &quot;súil&quot; (&quot;eye, sight&quot;).

A common Proto-Celtic root &quot;*sūli-&quot;, related to the various Indo-European words for &quot;sun&quot; (cf. Homeric Greek ἡέλιος, Sanskrit &quot;sūryah&quot;, from c &quot;*suh2lio-&quot;) has also been proposed, although the Brittonic terms for &quot;sun&quot; (Old Breton &quot;houl&quot;, Old Welsh &quot;heul&quot;) feature a diphthong that is absent from &quot;Sulis&quot; and they are not attested as a feminine form or with the &quot;-i-&quot; inflection. Pierre-Yves Lambert argues for a Proto-Celtic form &quot;*su-wli-&quot;, composed of the prefix &quot;su-&quot; (&quot;good&quot;) attached to the Celtic verbal theme &quot;*wel-&quot; (&quot;to see&quot;).

The medieval Welsh personal name &quot;Sulgen&quot; (&lt; &quot;Sulien&quot;; &quot;born from Sulis&quot;) and the Breton personal name &quot;Sul&quot;, borne by a local saint, are also related.

==Cult at Bath==

Sulis was the local goddess of the thermal springs that still feed the spa baths at Bath, which the Romans called &quot;Aquae Sulis&quot; (&quot;the waters of Sulis&quot;). Sulis was likely venerated as a healing divinity, whose sacred hot springs could cure physical or spiritual suffering and illness. According to scholar Miranda Green, the cult of Sulis at Bath was active until the mid-fourth century CE. Her name primarily appears on inscriptions discovered in an extensive temple area to her at Bath, with only a single instance outside of Britain at Alzey, Germany.

At the Roman temple at Bath, several ancient additions to the altar area suggest that sacrifice there was a major part of worshipping the goddess. The open area surrounding the altar may have been used for processions and public offerings of meats and liquids. A majority of the finds at the spring consist of coins and curse tablets (see &quot;Inscribed tablets&quot; section next), with over 12,500 Roman coins and 18 Celtic coins having been found in the reservoir. In addition, items have also been retrieved that were likely private offerings, such as jewelry, gemstones, plates, bowls, military items, wooden and leather objects.

Pewter vessels found in the spring reservoir have led some scholars to conclude that physical contact with the water may have been important for transfer of healing properties, with these vessels being used to pour the water over visitors&#x27; bodies.

From the evidence of funerary inscriptions discovered on the site, it appears that visitors to the sacred springs may have included retired soldiers, soldiers acting as tourists, and/or soldiers looking for relief from injury or illness. In order to afford the inscriptions, those who recorded their visit with altars or tombstones would likely have been of higher status.

The Temple to Sulis Minerva was known for burning coal in the altar-fire instead of wood. This coal would have been brought by slaves, who would also assist in cleaning and service for cult meals.

The gilt bronze cult statue of Sulis Minerva &quot;appears to have been deliberately damaged&quot; sometime in later Antiquity, perhaps by barbarian raiders, Christian zealots, or some other forces.

About 130 curse tablets, mostly addressed to Sulis, have been found in the sacred spring at the Roman baths in Bath. Typically, the text on the tablets offered to Sulis relates to theft; for example, of small amounts of money or clothing from the bath-house. It is evident, from the localized style of Latin (&quot;British Latin&quot;) used, that a high proportion of the tablets came from the native population. In formulaic, often legalistic, language, the tablets appeal to the goddess Sulis to punish the known or unknown perpetrators of the crime until reparations are made. Sulis is typically requested to impair the physical and mental well-being of the perpetrator, by the denial of sleep, causing normal bodily functions to cease, or even by death. These afflictions are to cease only when the property is returned to the owner or disposed of as the owner wishes, often by its being dedicated to the goddess. One message found on a tablet in the Temple at Bath (once decoded) reads: &quot;Docimedis has lost two gloves and asks that the thief responsible should lose their minds [&quot;sic&quot;] and eyes in the goddess&#x27; temple.&quot;
The tablets were often written in code, by means of letters or words being written backwards; word order may be reversed and lines may be written in alternating directions, from left to right and then right to left (boustrophedon). While most texts from Roman Britain are in Latin, two scripts found here, written on pewter sheets, are in an unknown language which may be Brythonic. If so, they would be the only examples of writing in this language ever found.

The only dated tablet of the collection is Bath tablet 94, though no year is given alongside the day and month. This can be inferred, however, by comparison to handwriting used on other tablets, which range from the &#x27;Old Roman cursive&#x27; of the second and third centuries CE to the &#x27;New Roman cursive&#x27; of the fourth century CE. As argued by Tomlin in his 2020 publication, this shows the popularity of the inscriptions, and therefore the likely belief in their efficacy, for at least two centuries.

==Syncretism with Minerva==
At Bath, the Roman temple was dedicated to Sulis Minerva as the primary deity of the temple spa. It is likely that devotion to Sulis existed in Bath before the Roman presence in the area, by the local Celtic Dobunni tribe, who may have believed that Sulis had curative powers. Sulis&#x27; pre-Roman presence has also been suggested by the discovery of eighteen Celtic Iron Age coins at the lowest levels of the site, as documented by Barry Cunliffe in 1988. This is one of the reasons Sulis is named first in the syncretic Sulis Minerva. Through the Roman Minerva syncresis, later mythographers have inferred that Sulis was also a goddess of wisdom and decisions.

Of the 17 dedicatory altars and bases found at the Roman temple at Bath, 9 evoke Sulis Minerva through her single or double name. In particular, there are two altars found at the Cross Bath (RIB 146) and Hot Bath (RIB 150) sites respectively, which list &#x27;Sulis Minerva&#x27; in full. The altar found at the Hot Bath reads &quot;To the goddess Sulis Minerva Sulinus, son of Maturus, willingly and deservedly fulfilled his vow&quot; (RIB 150).

Sulis was not the only goddess exhibiting syncretism with Minerva. Senua&#x27;s name appears on votive plaques bearing Minerva&#x27;s image, while Brigantia also shares many traits associated with Minerva. The identification of multiple Celtic gods with the same Roman god is not unusual (both Mars and Mercury were paired with a multiplicity of Celtic names). On the other hand, Celtic goddesses tended to resist syncretism; Sulis Minerva is one of the few attested pairings of a Celtic goddess with her Roman counterpart.

Dedications to &quot;Minerva&quot; are common in both Great Britain and continental Europe, most often without any Celtic epithet or interpretation (cf. Belisama for one exception).

==Solar goddess==
Based on her name&#x27;s etymology, as well as several other characteristics, such as the association with sight, civic law, and epithets relating to light, Sulis has been interpreted as a solar deity, at least in pre-Roman times. Some researchers have further suggested a role as the &quot;de facto&quot; Celtic solar deity, the associated Sulevia and similar names being the goddess&#x27;s attestations elsewhere.

==Modern worship==
Sulis has a number of modern-day worshipers among the Wiccan and pagan communities. As of 1998, some people still deposited offerings in the waters of the Roman baths.

== Sulis in art and epigraphy ==

=== Sulis Minerva&#x27;s head ===
A gilt bronze head of the goddess Sulis Minerva was discovered in Bath in 1727 (see top right), which was probably from a cult statue that stood inside her temple, next to the sacred spring. It is possible that this statue was positioned across the temple courtyard from the sacrificial altar site. The statue may be a product of the foundation of the Roman site, dating from the late first-century CE. There are only two other known gilt bronze finds from Roman Britain.

=== Temple pediment and Gorgon&#x27;s head ===

Discovered in 1790, this pediment from the Temple of Sulis Minerva features a large Gorgon&#x27;s head in its centre. It was likely carved in the first century CE, by craftsmen from northern Gaul. Originally at a height of fifteen metres, the pediment would have been supported by four fluted columns. There are also several accompanying images on the pediment, such as Tritons (the half-fish and half-men servants to Neptune), a face-helmet shaped like a dolphin&#x27;s head, a small owl, and female Victories standing on globes.

One interpretation of the central image, giving the piece its name, is that the head represents the mythical Gorgon. As Greek mythology has it, the hero Perseus killed the Gorgon and gave the head to Athena, who wore it on her breastplate. Thus, the Roman Baths Museum suggests a possible connection between the Gorgon to the goddess Sulis Minerva (Minerva being the Roman equivalent of the Greek Athena). While the Gorgon on the pediment is male and the mythical Gorgon was female, it has been suggested that the pediment image was altered to reflect a combination of Celtic and classical styles.

Another interpretation is that the central head reflects a water god, due to similarities with other water gods from Britain. For example, the Roman Baths Museum points to a silver dish from Mindenhall depicting the god Oceanus.

In a 2016 article, Eleri H. Cousins argued that much of the imagery on the pediment can be linked to imperial iconography, including the Victories, the oak wreath and the star at its apex. In addition, Cousins highlighted other examples of similar first- and second-century architectural features, particularly Gorgon imagery found in Gaul and Spain, to suggest that the Forum of Augustus in Rome was used as an overall archetype. According to Cousins, the pediment and its imagery are not just &#x27;Roman&#x27; or &#x27;Celtic&#x27;, but result from a mixture of styles and concepts from &quot;the local to the empire-wide&quot;.

=== Altar-like statue base ===
The altar-like statue base was found on the pavement nearby the steps of the Temple for Sulis Minerva. The base reads, &quot;To the goddess Sulis, Lucius Marcius Memor, soothsayer, gave (this) as a gift&quot; (RIB III, 3049). This is the only known instance of a haruspex, or professional diviner who interpreted sacrificed animals&#x27; entrails, from Britain. The original inscription used the abbreviation &#x27;HAR&#x27; to distinguish Memor as a haruspex, but it appears there was a later addition of the letters &#x27;VSP&#x27;. This may have been an attempt to clarify his position as more than an informal &#x27;soothsayer&#x27;, and suggests that Memor may not have been attached to the temple itself, but rather that he may have been a visiting member of the governor&#x27;s staff.

=== Altar-like tombstone ===
This tombstone resembling an altar (see top left) was found with two cinerary urns outside the city of Bath, in the parish of Bathwick, 800 metres north-east of the Roman Baths. The tombstone reads, &quot;To the spirits of the departed; Gaius Calpurnius Receptus, priest of the goddess Sulis, lived 75 years; Calpurnia Trifosa, his freedwoman (and) wife, had this set up&quot; (RIB 155). Receptus&#x27; widow&#x27;s name, Trifosa, is Greek and means &#x27;De Luxe&#x27;, and would have likely been her given name when she was a slave, before she was freed and married to her former owner, the priest Receptus.

<doc id="539602" wikidata="Q3141882" url="?curid=539602" title="Government of the classical Ottoman Empire">
<text>The Ottoman Empire developed over the years as a despotism with the Sultan as the supreme ruler of a centralized government that had an effective control of its provinces, officials and inhabitants. Wealth and rank could be inherited but were just as often earned. Positions were perceived as titles, such as viziers and &quot;aghas&quot;. Military service was a key to many problems.

The expansion of the Empire called for a systematic administrative organization that developed into a dual system of military (&quot;Central Government&quot;) and civil administration (&quot;Provincial System&quot;) and developed a kind of separation of powers: higher executive functions were carried out by the military authorities and judicial and basic administration were carried out by civil authorities. Outside this system were various types of vassal and tributary states. Most of the areas ruled by the Ottomans were explicitly mentioned in the official full style of the sultan, including various lofty titles adopted to emphasize imperial rank and show the empire as being &quot;successor-in-law&quot; to conquered states.

The empire was divided into vilayets, with a governor assigned to each vilayet. The idea of vilayet originated from the Seljuk vassal state (&quot;Uç Beyliği&quot;) in central Anatolia. Over the years the Empire became an amalgamation of pre-existing polities, the Anatolian beyliks, brought under the sway of the ruling House of Osman.

==Central government==
The central government was composed of the Sultan and his own staff (bookkeepers, etc.) in what was known as &quot;House of Osman&quot;. The House of Osman was advised by the Divan, composed of the Grand Vizier and the ruling class (nobles). The ruling class was called the &quot;askeri&quot;, including the noblemen, court officials, military officers and the religious class called the &quot;ulema&quot;.

===House of Osman===

The Ottoman dynasty or &quot;House of Osman&quot; ( 1280–1922) was unprecedented and unequaled in the Islamic world for its size and duration. The Ottoman sultan, pâdişâh or &quot;lord of kings&quot;, served as the empire&#x27;s sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The Ottoman family was originally Turkish in its ethnicity, as were its subjects; however the kingship quickly acquired many different ethnicities through intermarriage with slaves and European nobility.

Throughout Ottoman history, howeverdespite the supreme &quot;de jure&quot; authority of the sultans and the occasional exercise of &quot;de facto&quot; authority by Grand Viziersthere were many instances in which local governors acted independently, and even in opposition to the ruler. On eleven occasions, the sultan was deposed because he was perceived by his enemies as a threat to the state. There were only two attempts in the whole of Ottoman history to unseat the ruling Osmanlı dynasty, both failures, which is suggestive of a political system which for an extended period was able to manage its revolutions without unnecessary instability.

After the dissolution of the empire, the new republic abolished the Sultanate and Caliphate and declared the members of the House of Osman as &quot;personae non gratae&quot; of Turkey. Fifty years later, in 1974, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey granted descendants of the former dynasty the right to acquire Turkish citizenship. The current head of the House of Osman is Harun Osman.

====Imperial Harem====

The Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the Valide sultan (Sultana Mother), mother of the reigning sultan, who held supreme power over the Harem and thus a powerful position in the court. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics and through her influence could diminish the power and position of the sultan. For a period of time beginning in the 16th century and extending into the 17th, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the &quot;Sultanate of Women&quot; (&quot;Kadınlar Saltanatı&quot;).

The harem had its own internal organization and order of formulating policies. Beneath the &quot;Valide Sultan&quot; in the hierarchy was the &quot;Haseki Sultan&quot;, chief consort of the sultan, who had the chance of becoming the next Valide Sultan when her son ascended to the throne. This position existed around the 16th and 17th centuries. The sultan also had four other official consorts, who were each called &quot;Kadın&quot;. Next in rank below the sultan&#x27;s wives were his eight favourite concubines (&quot;ikbâl&quot;s or &quot;hâs odalık&quot;s), and then the other concubines whom the sultan favoured and who were termed &quot;gözde&quot;. Next in rank were the concubines of other court officials. Pupils (&quot;acemî&quot;) and novices (&quot;câriye&quot; or &quot;şâhgird&quot;) were younger women who were either waiting to be married off to someone or who had not yet graduated out of the Harem School.

====Palace schools====

The Palace schools comprised not a single track, but two. First, the Madrasa () for the Muslims, which educated the scholars and the state officials in accordance with Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income. The second track, the Enderun School, was a boarding school for converted Christians, which conscripted 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between 8 and 20 years old from about one in forty families among the communities settled in Rumelia and/or the Balkans; a process known as Devşirme. Orphans, single children, married boys, Jews, Russians, and craftsmen&#x27;s and shepherd&#x27;s sons were exempted.

The Palace Schools were fairly successful in this trans-culturation of students, and many statesmen were products of this process. The system functioned strictly for government purposes, and (ideally) the graduates were permanently devoted to government service and had no interest in forming relations with lower social groups.

The incoming students were called the inner boys (Ottoman Turkish: iç oğlanlar). It took seven years of professional development to graduate. The apprenticeship began in the Sultan&#x27;s services; progressing to mastering natural and Islamic sciences (formal education); and finally to developing physical fitnesses, and vocational or artistic skills. It is reported by Madeline Zilfi that European visitors of the time commented &quot;In making appointments, Sultan pays no regard to any pretensions on the score of wealth or rank. It is by merits that man rise..Among the Turks, honours, high posts and Judgeships are rewards of great ability and good service.&quot;

===The Divan===

Though the sultan was the &quot;sublime monarch&quot;, he had a number of advisors and ministers. The most powerful of these were the viziers of the Divan or Imperial Council, led by the Grand Vizier. The Divan was a council where the viziers met and debated the politics of the empire. It was the Grand Vizier&#x27;s duty to inform the sultan of the opinion of the Divan. The sultan often took his vizier&#x27;s advice into consideration, but he by no means had to obey the Divan. Sometimes the sultan called a Divan meeting himself if he had something important to inform his viziers of, such as imminent war. The viziers then carried out his orders. The Divan consisted of three viziers in the 14th century and eleven in the 17th century; four of them served as Viziers of the Dome, the most important ministers next to the Grand Vizier. Sometimes the commander (&quot;ağa&quot;) of the Janissaries attended the Divan meetings as well.

Mehmed II conquered Constantinople in (1453) and established his court there. The Sultan presided in person over the Council of Statecalled Divan, after the seat he sat on, until an incident arose (so it is related) when a ragged Turcoman blundered into a meeting of the Divan and demanded &quot;Well, which of you is the happy Emperor ?&quot;. Mehmed was incensed and the Grand Vizier suggested he sit above the fray. Consequently, a latticed bay was constructed &quot;The eye of the Sultan&quot;, enabling Mehmed to look down unseen.

== Provincial governance (civil administration)==
Townspeople, villagers and farmers formed a lower class called the rayah. Both in contemporaneous and in modern usage, it refers to non-Muslim subjects in particular, also called zimmi.

Civil and judicial administration was carried out under a separate parallel system of small municipal or rural units called &quot;kazas&quot; administered by a &quot;qadi&quot; (&quot;kadı&quot;). Kazas in turn were subdivided into &quot;nahiyas&quot;. The qadis came from the ulema and represent the legal authority of the sultan. The civil system was considered a check on the military system since beys (who represented executive authority) could not carry out punishment without the sentence of a qadi. Likewise, qadis were not permitted to personally effect punishment. In the areas of &quot;sharia&quot; and &quot;kanun&quot; law, qadis were responsible directly to the sultan.

== Vassal states ==
The Ottoman Empire had many vassal states of varying size attached to it. Vassals paid taxes to the sultan and often contributed with troops in various Ottoman military campaigns. Many of the imperial provinces were vassal states before being reduced to provinces. A vassal state that never became a province was the Khanate of Crimea in the region around Crimea, north of Black Seait would fall to Russia instead (1783; later in modern Ukraine).
* A special case was the Greek orthodox &#x27;monastic republic&#x27; of Mount Athos, where Constantinople was only represented by an aga (officer) as its agent in Karyaes.
*As the empire weakened militarily, it would inevitably lose control through foreign victories (Russia took large chunks of territory and helped parts of the Balkans secede, often after a vassalic stage, such as the hospodars) but also see real control over some of its (mainly remote) provinces slip away to a state of little more than formal sovereignty over tributary, de facto autonomous states.
The latter happened in North Africa: the Beys/Deys of Tunis and Algiers established themselves as &#x27;regencies&#x27; and even Egypt went its own way under its great khedive Mohammed Alithey would in turn be subjected to European colonial dominance, as protectorates, of France and Britain.

<text>Central Africa (French: &quot;Afrique centrale&quot;; Spanish: &quot;África central&quot;; Portuguese: &quot;África Central&quot;) is a subregion of the African continent comprising various countries according to different definitions. Middle Africa is an analogous term used by the United Nations in its geoscheme for Africa and consists of the following countries: Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and São Tomé and Príncipe. The United Nations Office for Central Africa also includes Burundi and Rwanda in the region, which are considered part of East Africa in the geoscheme. These eleven countries are members of the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS). Six of those countries (Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and Republic of the Congo) are also members of the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) and share a common currency, the Central African CFA franc.

The African Development Bank, on the other hand, defines &quot;Central Africa&quot; as seven countries: Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon.

== List of Central African countries ==
== Background ==

The Central African Federation (1953–1963), also called the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, was made up of what are now the nations of Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Similarly, the Anglican Church of the Province of Central Africa covers dioceses in Botswana, Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, while the Church of Central Africa, Presbyterian has synods in Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. These states are now typically considered part of East or Southern Africa.

==Geography==

The Congo River basin has historically been ecologically significant to the populations of Central Africa, serving as an important supra-regional organization in Central Africa.

==History==

===Prehistory===
Archeological finds in Central Africa have been made which date back over 100,000 years. According to Zagato and Holl, there is evidence of iron smelting in the Central African Republic that may date back to 3000 to 2500 BCE. Extensive walled settlements have recently been found in Northeast Nigeria, approximately southwest of Lake Chad dating to the first millennium BCE.

Trade and improved agricultural techniques supported more sophisticated societies, leading to the early civilizations of West Africa: Sao, Kanem, Bornu, Shilluk, Baguirmi, and Wadai.

Around 2500 BCE, Bantu migrants had reached the Great Lakes Region in Central Africa. Halfway through the first millennium BCE, the Bantu had also settled as far south as what is now Angola.

=== Ancient history ===
====Sao civilization====
The West African Sao civilization flourished from ca. the 6th century BCE to as late as the 16th century CE in northern Central Africa. The Sao lived by the Chari River south of Lake Chad in territory that later became part of Cameroon and Chad. They are the earliest people to have left clear traces of their presence in the territory of modern Cameroon. Today, several ethnic groups of northern Cameroon and southern Chad but particularly the Sara people claim descent from the civilization of the Sao. Sao artifacts show that they were skilled workers in bronze, copper, and iron. Finds include bronze sculptures and terra cotta statues of human and animal figures, coins, funerary urns, household utensils, jewelry, highly decorated pottery, and spears. The largest Sao archaeological finds have been made south of Lake Chad.

===Kanem Empire===
The West-Central African kingdom of Kanem–Bornu Empire was centered in the Lake Chad Basin. It was known as the Kanem Empire from the 9th century CE onward and lasted as the independent kingdom of Bornu until 1900. At its height it encompassed an area covering not only much of Chad, but also parts of modern eastern Niger, northeastern Nigeria, northern Cameroon and parts of South Sudan. The history of the Empire is mainly known from the Royal Chronicle or &quot;Girgam&quot; discovered in 1851 by the German traveler Heinrich Barth. Kanem rose in the 8th century in the region to the north and east of Lake Chad. The Kanem empire went into decline, shrank, and in the 14th century was defeated by Bilala invaders from the Lake Fitri region.

===Bornu Empire===

The Kanuri people of West Africa led by the Sayfuwa migrated to the west and south of the lake, where they established the Bornu Empire. By the late 16th century the Bornu empire had expanded and recaptured the parts of Kanem that had been conquered by the Bulala. Satellite states of Bornu included the Damagaram in the west and Baguirmi to the southeast of Lake Chad.

===Shilluk Kingdom===

The Shilluk Kingdom was centered in South Sudan from the 15th century from along a strip of land along the western bank of White Nile, from Lake No to about 12° north latitude. The capital and royal residence were in the town of Fashoda. The kingdom was founded during the mid-15th century CE by its first ruler, Nyikang. During the 19th century, the Shilluk Kingdom faced decline following military assaults from the Ottoman Empire and later British and Sudanese colonization in Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.

===Baguirmi Kingdom===

The Kingdom of Baguirmi existed as an independent state during the 16th and 17th centuries southeast of West-Central Africa Lake Chad region in what is now the country of Chad. Baguirmi emerged to the southeast of the Kanem–Bornu Empire. The kingdom&#x27;s first ruler was Mbang Birni Besse. Later in his reign, the Bornu Empire conquered and made the state a tributary.

===Wadai Empire===

The Wadai Empire was centered in Chad from the 17th century. The Tunjur people founded the Wadai Kingdom to the east of Bornu in the 16th century. In the 17th century, there was a revolt of the Maba people who established a Muslim dynasty.
At first, Wadai paid tribute to Bornu and Durfur, but by the 18th century, Wadai was fully independent and had become an aggressor against its neighbors.

===Lunda Empire===

Following the Bantu Migration from Western Africa, Bantu kingdoms and empires began to develop in southern Central Africa. In the 1450s, a Luba from the royal family Ilunga Tshibinda married Lunda queen Rweej and united all Lunda peoples. Their son Mulopwe Luseeng expanded the kingdom. His son Naweej expanded the empire further and is known as the first Lunda emperor, with the title &quot;Mwata Yamvo&quot; (&quot;mwaant yaav&quot;, &quot;mwant yav&quot;), the &quot;Lord of Vipers&quot;. The Luba political system was retained, and conquered peoples were integrated into the system. The &quot;mwata yamvo&quot; assigned a &quot;cilool&quot; or &quot;kilolo&quot; (royal adviser) and tax collector to each state conquered.

Numerous states claimed descent from the Lunda. The Imbangala of inland Angola claimed descent from a founder, Kinguri, brother of Queen Rweej, who could not tolerate the rule of &quot;mulopwe&quot; Tshibunda. &quot;Kinguri&quot; became the title of kings of states founded by Queen Rweej&#x27;s brother. The Luena (Lwena) and Lozi (Luyani) in Zambia also claim descent from Kinguri. During the 17th century, a Lunda chief and warrior called Mwata Kazembe set up an Eastern Lunda kingdom in the valley of the Luapula River. The Lunda&#x27;s western expansion also saw claims of descent by the Yaka and the Pende. The Lunda linked Central Africa with the western coast trade. The kingdom of Lunda came to an end in the 19th century when it was invaded by the Chokwe, who were armed with guns.

===Kongo Kingdom===

By the 15th century CE, the farming Bakongo people (&quot;ba&quot; being the plural prefix) were unified as the Kingdom of Kongo under a ruler called the &quot;manikongo&quot;, residing in the fertile Pool Malebo area on the lower Congo River. The capital was M&#x27;banza-Kongo. With superior organization, they were able to conquer their neighbors and extract tribute. They were experts in metalwork, pottery, and weaving raffia cloth. They stimulated interregional trade via a tribute system controlled by the &quot;manikongo&quot;. Later, maize (corn) and cassava (manioc) would be introduced to the region via trade with the Portuguese at their ports at Luanda and Benguela. The maize and cassava would result in population growth in the region and other parts of Africa, replacing millet as the main staple.

By the 16th century, the &quot;manikongo&quot; held authority from the Atlantic in the west to the Kwango River in the east. Each territory was assigned a &quot;mani-mpembe&quot; (provincial governor) by the &quot;manikongo&quot;. In 1506, Afonso I (1506–1542), a Christian, took over the throne. Slave trading increased with Afonso&#x27;s wars of conquest. About 1568 to 1569, the Jaga invaded Kongo, laying waste to the kingdom and forcing the &quot;manikongo&quot; into exile. In 1574, Manikongo Álvaro I was reinstated with the help of Portuguese mercenaries. During the latter part of the 1660s, the Portuguese tried to gain control of Kongo. Manikongo António I (1661–1665), with a Kongolese army of 5,000, was destroyed by an army of Afro-Portuguese at the Battle of Mbwila. The empire dissolved into petty polities, fighting among each other for war captives to sell into slavery.

Kongo gained captives from the Kingdom of Ndongo in wars of conquest. Ndongo was ruled by the &quot;ngola&quot;. Ndongo would also engage in slave trading with the Portuguese, with São Tomé being a transit point to Brazil. The kingdom was not as welcoming as Kongo; it viewed the Portuguese with great suspicion and as an enemy. The Portuguese in the latter part of the 16th century tried to gain control of Ndongo but were defeated by the Mbundu. Ndongo experienced depopulation from slave raiding. The leaders established another state at Matamba, affiliated with Queen Nzinga, who put up a strong resistance to the Portuguese until coming to terms with them. The Portuguese settled along the coast as trade dealers, not venturing on conquest of the interior. Slavery wreaked havoc in the interior, with states initiating wars of conquest for captives. The Imbangala formed the slave-raiding state of Kasanje, a major source of slaves during the 17th and 18th centuries.

===Modern history===


During the Conference of Berlin in 1884–85 Africa was divided up between the European colonial powers, defining boundaries that are largely intact with today&#x27;s post-colonial states. On 5 August 1890 the British and French concluded an agreement to clarify the boundary between French West Africa and what would become Nigeria. A boundary was agreed along a line from Say on the Niger to Barruwa on Lake Chad, but leaving the Sokoto Caliphate in the British sphere. Parfait-Louis Monteil was given charge of an expedition to discover where this line actually ran.
On 9 April 1892 he reached Kukawa on the shore of the lake.
Over the next twenty years a large part of the Chad Basin was incorporated by treaty or by force into French West Africa. On 2 June 1909, the Wadai capital of Abéché was occupied by the French. The remainder of the basin was divided by the British in Nigeria, who took Kano in 1903, and the Germans in Cameroon.

The countries of the basin regained their independence between 1956 and 1962, retaining the colonial administrative boundaries. Chad, Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, and the Central African Republic became autonomous states with the dissolution of French Equatorial Africa in 1958, gaining full independence in 1960. The Democratic Republic of the Congo also gained independence from Belgium in 1960, but quickly devolved into a period of political upheaval and conflict known as the Congo Crisis (19601965) which ended with the installment of Joseph Mobutu as president and renamed the country Zaire in 1971. Equatorial Guinea gained independence from Spain in 1968, leading to the election of Francisco Macías Nguema, now widely regarded as one of the most brutal dictators in history. In 1961, Angola became involved in the Portuguese Colonial War, a 13-year-long struggle for independence in Lusophone Africa. It gained independence only in 1975, following the 1974 Carnation Revolution in Lisbon. São Tomé and Príncipe also gained independence in 1975 in the aftermath of the Carnation Revolution. In 2011, South Sudan gained its independence from the Republic of Sudan after over 50 years of war.

In the 21st century, many jihadist and Islamist groups began to operate in the Central African region, including the Seleka and the Ansaru.

Over the course of the 2010s, the internationally unrecognized secessionist state called Ambazonia gained increasing momentum in its home regions, resulting in the ongoing Anglophone Crisis in Cameroon.

==Economy==

The main economic activities of Central Africa are farming, herding and fishing. At least 40% of the rural population of northern and eastern Central Africa lives in poverty and routinely face chronic food shortages. Crop production based on rain is possible only in the southern belt. Slash-and-burn agriculture is a common practice. Flood recession agriculture is practiced around Lake Chad and in the riverine wetlands. Nomadic herders migrate with their animals into the grasslands of the northern part of the basin for a few weeks during each short rainy season, where they intensively graze the highly nutritious grasses. When the dry season starts they move back south, either to grazing lands around the lakes and floodplains, or to the savannas further to the south.

In the 2000–01 period, fisheries in the Lake Chad basin provided food and income to more than 10 million people, with a harvest of about 70,000 tons. Fisheries have traditionally been managed by a system where each village has recognized rights over a defined part of the river, wetland or lake, and fishers from elsewhere must seek permission and pay a fee to use this area. The governments only enforced rules and regulations to a limited extent. Local governments and traditional authorities are increasingly engaged in rent-seeking, collecting license fees with the help of the police or army.

Oil is also a major export of the countries of northern and eastern Central Africa, notably making up a large proportion of the GDPs of Chad and South Sudan.

==Demographics==

Following the Bantu Migration, Central Africa is primarily inhabited by Native African or Bantu peoples and Bantu languages predominate. These include the Mongo, Kongo and Luba peoples. Central Africa also includes many Nilo-Saharan and Niger-Congo Ubangian communities: in north western Central Africa the Nilo-Saharan Kanuri predominate. Most of the Ubangian speakers in Africa (often grouped with Niger-Congo) are also found in Central Africa, such as the Gbaya, Banda and Zande, in northern Central Africa.

Notable Central African supra-regional organizations include the Lake Chad Basin Commission and the Economic Community of Central African States.

The predominant religions of Central Africa are Christianity and traditional faiths. Chad is the only country in the region where Islam in the majority religion. Islam is also common in Cameroon, being practiced by about 30% of the population. Smaller Muslim communities exist in the other countries too.


Due to common historical processes and widespread demographic movements between the countries of Central Africa before the Bantu Migration into much of southern Central Africa, the cultures of the region evidence many similarities and interrelationships. Similar cultural practices stemming from common origins as largely Nilo-Saharan or Bantu peoples are also evident in Central Africa including in music, dance, art, body adornment, initiation, and marriage rituals.

Some major Native African ethnic groups in Central Africa are as follows:

<text>Huzzah (sometimes written hazzah; originally HUZZAH spelled huzza and pronounced , now often pronounced as ; in most modern varieties of English hurrah or hooray) is, according to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (&quot;OED&quot;), &quot;apparently a mere exclamation&quot;. The dictionary does not mention any specific derivation. Whatever its origins, it has seen occasional literary use since at least the time of Shakespeare, as the first use was in 1573, according to Merriam-Webster.

==Use==
&quot;Huzzah&quot; may be categorised with such interjections as &quot;hoorah&quot; and &quot;hooray&quot;. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, &quot;In English, the form &quot;hurrah&quot; is literary and dignified; &quot;hooray&quot; is usual in popular acclamation&quot;.

In common usage, such as cheers at sporting events and competitions, the speaker need not make distinction, and the words are distinguished by regional dialect and accent.

===Origin and military usage===
The origin of the word in its various forms is unclear, but it may have been influenced by war cries from various languages: the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (OED) suggests Norse, Dutch, Russian and Prussian words that may have played a part.

Anthropologist Jack Weatherford hypothesized that it comes from the Mongolian &quot;Huree&quot;; used by Mongol armies, and spread throughout the world during the Mongol Empire of the 13th century. The word is a praise, much like &quot;Amen&quot; or &quot;Hallelujah&quot;, shouted at the end of speeches or prayers.

Contrary to popular belief, the word does &quot;not&quot; appear in William Shakespeare’s original works. Written in three parts around 1591, Shakespeare’s &quot;I&quot;, &quot;II&quot;, and &quot;III Henry VI&quot; were condensed by Charles Kemble in 1888 into a single text titled, &quot;Henry VI&quot;. Though Kemble&#x27;s condensed version records the last line of Act III, Scene III as, &quot;&quot;All.&quot; Huzza ! huzza ! huzza !— Long live the King !&quot;, this line does not appear in Shakespeare’s original text, but is rather Kemble’s own insertion between &quot;II Henry VI&quot;, Act IV, Scenes VIII and IX.

Often incorrectly used at Renaissance fairs and American Revolution reenactment, Huzzah was originally spelled “Huzza” and pronounced “huz-ZAY”. In late 18th-century literature, words like “say”, “play”, and “day” were used to rhyme with Huzza, as in the song &quot;Keppel Forever&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Bonfires, bells did ring; Keppel was all the ding,
Music did play;
Windows with candles in, for all to honor him:
People aloud did sing, &#x27;Keppel! Huzza!&#x27;&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

The&quot; OED&quot; notes that in the 17th and 18th centuries, it was identified as a sailor’s cheer or salute, and suggests it was possibly related to words like &quot;heeze&quot; and &quot;hissa&quot;, which are cognates of &quot;hoist&quot;.

In the 18th and early 19th centuries, three &#x27;huzzahs&#x27; were given by British Army infantry before a bayonet charge, as a way of building their morale and intimidating the enemy. In the book &quot;,&quot; military historian Richard Holmes indicates that this was given as two short &#x27;huzzahs&#x27;, followed by a third sustained one as the charge was carried out.

<doc id="539612" wikidata="Q2450190" url="?curid=539612" title="Pulteney Bridge">
<text>Pulteney Bridge is a bridge over the River Avon in Bath, England. It was completed by 1774, and connected the city with the land of the Pulteney family which the family wished to develop. Designed by Robert Adam in a Palladian style, it is highly unusual in that it has shops built across its full span on both sides. It has been designated as a Grade I listed building.

Within 20 years of its construction, alterations were made that expanded the shops and changed the façades. By the end of the 18th century, it had been damaged by floods, but was rebuilt to a similar design. Over the next century alterations to the shops included cantilevered extensions on the bridge&#x27;s north face. In the 20th century, several schemes were carried out to preserve the bridge and partially return it to its original appearance, enhancing its appeal as a tourist attraction.

The bridge is now long and wide. Although there have been plans to pedestrianise the bridge, it is still used by buses and taxis. The much photographed bridge and weir below are close to the centre of the city, a World Heritage Site, renowned for its Georgian architecture.

== Background ==
The bridge is named after Frances Pulteney, wife of William Johnstone. He was a wealthy Scottish lawyer and Member of Parliament (MP). Frances was the third daughter of MP and government official Daniel Pulteney (1684–1731) and first cousin once removed of William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath. She inherited the Earl&#x27;s substantial fortune and estates close to Bath in Somerset after his death in 1764 and that of his younger brother and heir in 1767, and the Johnstones changed their surname to Pulteney. The rural Bathwick estate, which Frances and William inherited in 1767, was across the river from the city and could only be reached by ferry. William made plans to create a new town, which would become a suburb to the historic city of Bath, but first he needed a better river crossing. The work of the Pulteneys is memorialised by Great Pulteney Street in Bathwick, and Henrietta Street and Laura Place, named after their daughter Henrietta Laura Johnstone.

==Design and construction==
Pultney Bridge was designed by Robert Adam, whose original drawings are preserved in the Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum in London. It is one of only four bridges in the world to have shops across its full span on both sides, the others being in Italy (in Florence and Venice) and in Erfurt, Germany.

Initial plans for the bridge were drawn up by Thomas Paty, who estimated it would cost £4,569 to build, but that did not include the shops. A second estimate of £2,389 was obtained from local builders John Lowther and Richard Reed; it included two shops at each end of the bridge, but work did not begin before winter weather made construction of the pillars impossible. In 1770 the brothers Robert and James Adam, who were working on designs for the new town at Bathwick, adapted Paty&#x27;s original design. Robert Adam envisaged an elegant structure lined with shops, similar to the Ponte Vecchio and the Ponte di Rialto he would likely have seen when he visited Florence and Venice. Adam&#x27;s design more closely followed Andrea Palladio&#x27;s rejected design for the Rialto. The revised bridge was wide, rather than the width envisaged by Paty, which overcame the objections of the local council about the bridge being too narrow.

Construction started in 1769 and was completed by 1774 at a cost of £11,000. The builders for the lower part of the bridge were local masons Reed and Lowther; the shops were constructed by Singers and Lankeshere.

== Development ==
Pulteney Bridge stood for less than 20 years in the form that Adam created. In 1792 alterations were made during which the bridge was widened to and the shops enlarged, converting the original sixteen shops into six larger ones. Floods in 1799 and 1800 wrecked the north side of the bridge, which had been constructed with inadequate support. A temporary bridge was erected, and repairs were completed in 1804. Thomas Telford suggested replacing the bridge with a single span cast iron bridge. However it was rebuilt by John Pinch senior, surveyor to the Pulteney estate, in a less ambitious version of Adam&#x27;s design. Nineteenth-century shopkeepers changed the structure and appearance of their premises by changing windows, or expanding them by adding cantilevers over the river. Some painted advertisements on the outside of their shops, affecting the view from the river and Grand Parade. The western end pavilion on the south side was demolished in 1903 for road widening and its replacement was not an exact match.

In 1936 the bridge was designated an ancient monument. The city council bought several of the shops and made plans for the restoration of the original façade, which was completed in time for the Festival of Britain in 1951. The status of the bridge as an ancient monument was replaced in 1955 with its designation as a Grade I listed building. Further work was carried out in the 1960s to repair the underside soffits of all three arches. More restoration of the southern street facade was needed in 1975.

In 2009 Bath and North East Somerset council put forward a proposal to close the bridge to motor traffic and convert it to a pedestrianised zone, but the plan was abandoned in September 2011. It however remains a large source of income for the council, due to it being the most fined bus lane in the city.

== Architecture ==
The bridge features a narrow street flanked by two full length rows of shops designed in the Palladian style c. 1770. All sit above three segmental arches of equal span. The shops on the north side have cantilevered rear extensions. Consequently, the northern external façade of the bridge is asymmetrical, much altered and of no architectural merit, whereas the southern external side clearly shows the hand of Robert Adam.

Built of limestone, in classic Palladian style, the southern façade takes the form of a temple-like central bay with symmetrical wings connecting to two flanking, terminating pavilions. The central bay is given eminence by a broken-bed pediment supported by austere Doric pilasters. It in turn is flanked by two small bays, each with a small pointed pediment supported by shallow pilasters, which further emphasise and complement the central broken-bed pediment sitting above a large Palladian window – the focal point of the building. On this southern side the structure comprises a principal floor at street level, with a low mezzanine separated by stone banding above. Beneath the principal floor is a sub-floor constructed in the masonry between the spans of the bridge, its presence indicated by ocular windows placed symmetrically beneath the span of each arch. This ocular motif, on a reduced scale, is repeated symmetrically at mezzanine level beneath the central broken-bed pediment. The two terminating pavilions, in reality slight projections, have shallow saucer domes concealed behind their pointed pediments. The roof is pitched and of Welsh slate.

The western mid-stream pier was rebuilt in 1804. Further alteration took place in 1895, when the western pavilion was moved for the construction of the Grand Parade. The appearance changed yet again when the current weir, the scene of Javert&#x27;s suicide in the film version of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, was constructed between 1968 and 1972 as part of a flood-prevention scheme. Further restoration was undertaken in 1975.

<doc id="539618" wikidata="Q6377822" url="?curid=539618" title="Orland Kurtenbach">
<text>Orland John Kurtenbach (born September 7, 1936) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player and coach. A centre notable for his defensive skill and as one of the toughest fighters in the game, he played for several National Hockey League (NHL) teams during his twenty professional seasons, principally the Vancouver Canucks, with whom he became the NHL franchise&#x27;s inaugural captain.

==Early life==
Kurtenbach was born in Cudworth, Saskatchewan. He grew up on a farm until his family moved to Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, at age 10. It was at this time that Kurtenbach began playing organized hockey. Beginning as a defenceman, he moved to the centre position later in his career.
==Playing career==
Kurtenbach played in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League (SJHL) with the Prince Albert Mintos for two seasons, also making brief appearances with the Saskatoon Quakers of the minor professional Western Hockey League (WHL) during that time. In 1957, after Prince Albert was eliminated from the SJHL playoffs, Kurtenbach finished the season with the Flin Flon Bombers, where he helped the team win a Memorial Cup.

Kurtenbach turned professional in 1957–58, signing a C-form with the Vancouver Canucks of the WHL. He scored 54 points in 52 games en route to earning Rookie of the Year honours. In the playoffs, he helped the Canucks to a President&#x27;s Cup championship.

The majority of Kurtenbach&#x27;s early professional career was spent in the minors, splitting time between the AHL with the Buffalo Bisons, Springfield Indians and Providence Reds, and the WHL with the San Francisco Seals and the Canucks. His best season in this stretch was 1962–63 when he notched 87 points for the Seals in 70 games and led the team in scoring in the playoffs en route to winning the league championship.

During his time in the minors, Kurtenbach made two brief appearances in the National Hockey League with the New York Rangers and Boston Bruins, totaling eighteen games, but he did not play his first full NHL season until 1963–64 with the Bruins. In 1965–66, he became a member of the Toronto Maple Leafs, where he played a primarily defensive role. Toronto coach Punch Imlach designated Kurtenbach to the bottom two offensive lines while earning mostly penalty killing time. The following season, he joined the New York Rangers, where he spent four seasons. In the 1970 off-season, he was told by Rangers management he would be unprotected for the upcoming NHL Expansion Draft to be picked up by either the Buffalo Sabres or the Vancouver Canucks (the franchise left the WHL to join the NHL).
Kurtenbach was obtained by the Canucks and was named the franchise&#x27;s first NHL captain. On December 12, 1970, he recorded the first hat trick in Canucks history in a 5-2 victory over the California Golden Seals, it was also the only hat trick he ever recorded in his career. He recorded an NHL career-high point-per-game pace with 53 points in 52 games, despite suffering a serious injury on December 23 that sidelined him until March 3. The following season, he registered a career-high 61 points in 78 games. Many of Vancouver&#x27;s players left the club that season, defecting to the nascent World Hockey Association (WHA) for larger salaries. Kurtenbach himself was offered a $150,000 contract with the Los Angeles Sharks, but he declined. He often played on a line with Wayne Maki and Murray Hall. Kurtenbach retired from the NHL after his fourth season with Vancouver.

Kurtenbach finished his NHL career with 119 goals and 213 assists for 332 points in 639 games, adding 628 penalty minutes. On October 26, 2010, Kurtenbach was the first Canucks player inducted into the team&#x27;s Ring of Honour. A ceremony was held before a Canucks&#x27; game against the Colorado Avalanche.

==Coaching career==
The season after his NHL retirement, Kurtenbach joined the Seattle Totems of the Central Hockey League, moving behind the bench as head coach. After a losing season with Seattle, he coached two seasons with the Tulsa Oilers of the same league and won a championship in his first season with them, 1975–76, being awarded the Jake Milford Trophy as CHL coach of the year.

In 1976–77, Kurtenbach returned to the NHL to replace Phil Maloney midway through the season as head coach of the Vancouver Canucks. This marked the third time in his playing and coaching career that he would represent Vancouver. However, after one and a half seasons and a 36–62–27 record, Kurtenbach was replaced by Harry Neale at the end of the 1977–78 season. Upon his replacement, Kurtenbach only returned to coaching to represent the Springfield Indians of the AHL in 1982 and the Richmond Sockeyes of the BCHL in 1986 (whom he guided to the 1987 Centennial Cup)
before retiring.

==Personal life==
During his time with the Vancouver Canucks of the WHL, he met his wife. In the 1970s he lived in north Burnaby with his wife Laurel and kids. In 1980s and 1990s he lived in White Rock, BC and operated a south Surrey, BC golf driving range.

Built up owing to the merger between the former communes of Ascq, Annappes and Flers-lez-Lille, Villeneuve-d&#x27;Ascq is a new town and the cradle of the first automatic metro system of the world (VAL).

Villeneuve-d&#x27;Ascq is nicknamed the &#x27;green technopole&#x27; thanks to the implantation of many researchers, including two campuses of the University of Lille and many graduate engineering schools, and companies in a pleasant living environment. Owing to its activity centres, its Haute Borne European scientific park and two shopping malls, Villeneuve-d&#x27;Ascq is one of the main economic spots of the Hauts-de-France region; multinational corporations such as Bonduelle, Cofidis and Decathlon have their head office there.

<text>I (И и; italics: &quot;И и&quot; or И и; italics: &quot;И&quot; &quot;и&quot;) is a letter used in almost all modern Cyrillic alphabets with the exception of Belarusian.

It commonly represents either the close front unrounded vowel (e.g., in Russian), like the pronunciation of in &quot;machine&quot;, or the near-close near-front unrounded vowel , (e.g., in Ukrainian), like the pronunciation of in &quot;bin&quot;.

==History==
Because the Cyrillic letter И was derived from the Greek letter Eta (Η η), the Cyrillic had the shape of up to the 13th century.

The name of the Cyrillic letter И in the Early Cyrillic alphabet was (&quot;iže&quot;), meaning &quot;which&quot;.

In the Cyrillic numeral system, the Cyrillic letter И had a value of 8, corresponding to the Greek letter Eta (Η η).

In the Early Cyrillic alphabet, like in the Greek alphabet of the time (see Iotacism), there was little or no distinction between the letter / and the letter , the latter of which was derived from the Greek letter Iota (Ι ι). 

In New Church Slavonic, they co-exist with each other with no pronunciation differences. But in Ukrainian and Rusyn, the two letters have different pronunciations. Other modern orthographies for Slavic languages eliminated one of the two letters in alphabet reforms of the 19th or the 20th centuries. The Russian, Macedonian, Serbian, and Bulgarian languages now use only , and Belarusian uses only . However, the letter was also used in Russian before the Bolshevik reform of 1918.

==Form==
Originally, Cyrillic had the shape identical to the capital Greek letter Eta . The middle stroke was later turned counterclockwise, which resulted in the modern form resembling a mirrored capital Latin letter N and so is used in faux Cyrillic typography. However, the style of the two letters is not fully identical: in roman fonts, has heavier vertical strokes and serifs on all four corners, and has a heavier diagonal stroke and lacks a serif on the bottom-right corner.

In roman and oblique fonts, the lowercase letter has the same shape as the uppercase letter . In italic fonts, the lowercase letter looks like the italic form of the lowercase Latin U . Both uppercase and lowercase handwritten forms of the Cyrillic letter I look like handwritten forms of the Latin letter U.

== Usage ==
Since 1918, has been the tenth letter of the Russian alphabet, and in Russian, it represents , like the &quot;i&quot; in machine, except after some consonants (see below). In Russian, the letter typically denotes a preceding soft consonant and so is considered the soft counterpart to , which represents . However, unlike other &quot;soft&quot; vowels (е, ё, ю and я), и in isolation is not preceded by the semivowel. In Russian, the letter could be combined in the digraph (like , and ) to represent ё before it started around the 1950s, although that letter remains rare as people usually use е (apparent confusion has remained in the transcription of some foreign words).
 was used significantly less in Russian before the Bolshevik reform of 1918:
* ⟨і⟩ was used before all vowels and before the semivowel ⟨й⟩ except at the end of a morpheme in a compound word, where ⟨и⟩ was used. So англійскій (&quot;English&quot;) used ⟨і⟩, but пяти + акровый = пятиакровый (&quot;five-acre&quot;) used ⟨и⟩.
* ⟨и⟩ was used as the last letter of a word and before consonants except in for &quot;world, universe, local community, commons, society, laity&quot; (and words derived from it) to differentiate from &quot;peace&quot;). After 1918, both are spelled .

According to critics of the Bolshevik reform, the choice of &quot;Ии&quot; as the only letter to represent that side and the removal of &quot;Іі&quot; defeated the purpose of &#x27;simplifying’ the language, as &quot;Ии&quot; occupies more space and, furthermore, is sometimes indistinguishable from &quot;Шш&quot;.

 is pronounced in (sounds like ), (sounds like ) and (sounds like ), because in Russian, the sound usually cannot be pronounced after &quot;zh&quot; , &quot;sh&quot; , and &quot;ts&quot; .

In the Bulgarian Cyrillic alphabet is the ninth letter. It represents the sound and also occurs with a grave accent, ѝ, to distinguish orthographically the conjunction (&quot;and&quot;) and the short form of the indirect object (&quot;her&quot;).

In Kazakh, is used for and in native words and for in loanwords, and is used for in native words.

In Belarusian, the letter (и) is not used at all, and the sound is represented by the letter , which is also known as &quot;Belarusian-Ukrainian I&quot;.

The letter is the eleventh letter of the Ukrainian alphabet and represents the sound , a separate phoneme in Ukrainian. The Ukrainian can be transliterated to other languages that use the Cyrillic script by either and because of the lack of a uniform transliteration rule. Speakers of other Slavic languages can perceive Ukrainian as , , or sometimes even (see Ukrainian phonology for more on the pronunciation of ). The sound in Ukrainian is represented by the letter , just as in Belarusian.

In the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet, is the tenth letter of the alphabet. In Serbian, the letter represents , like the &quot;i&quot; in machine. In the Serbian Latin alphabet, the sound is represented by &quot;I/i&quot;.

In Macedonian, is the eleventh letter of the alphabet and represents the sound .

It is transliterated from Russian as or from Ukrainian as or , depending on the romanization system. (See romanization of Russian and romanization of Ukrainian for more details.)

In Tuvan, the letter can be written as a double vowel.

=== Stylistic uses ===

Due to its close resemblance to the Latin capital letter N, specifically as a &quot;flipped&quot; or &quot;reflected&quot; version of it, it is sometimes used stylistically as a replacement for N. This is commonly seen in Faux Cyrillic.

The industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails notably use both N and И in its logo. The hard rock band Linkin Park have also used the glyph, particularly on the cover of their debut album &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;.

American rapper Nathan Feuerstein is mainly known by his initials as &quot;NF&quot;, which is stylized as &quot;ИF&quot;.

== Accented forms and derived letters ==
The vowel that is represented by can, as is the case for almost any other Slavonic vowel, be stressed or unstressed. The stressed variant is sometimes (in special texts like dictionaries or to prevent ambiguity) graphically marked by the acute, grave, the double grave, or the circumflex accent.

Special Serbian texts also use with a macron to represent long unstressed variant of the sound. Serbian with a circumflex can be unstressed as well, which then represents the plural form of the genitive case to distinguish from other similar forms.

Modern Church Slavonic orthography uses the smooth breathing sign (Greek and Church Slavonic: &quot;psili&quot;, Latin: &quot;spiritus lenis&quot;) above the initial vowels (for tradition alone since there is no difference in pronunciation). It can be combined with acute or grave accents if necessary.

None of those combinations is considered to be a separate letter of respective alphabet, but one of them () has an individual code position in Unicode.

 with a breve forms the letter for the consonant or a similar semivowel, like the y in English &quot;yes.&quot; The form has been used regularly in Church Slavonic since the 16th century, but it officially became a separate letter of alphabet only much later (in Russian in 1918). The original name of was &quot;I s kratkoy&quot; (&#x27;I with the short [line]&#x27;), later &quot;I kratkoye&quot; (&#x27;short I&#x27;) in Russian. It is known similarly as &quot;I kratko&quot; in Bulgarian but as &quot;Yot&quot; in Ukrainian.

Cyrillic alphabets of non-Slavic languages have additional -based letters like or .

<text>In phonetics, a flap or tap is a type of consonantal sound, which is produced with a single contraction of the muscles so that one articulator (such as the tongue) is thrown against another.

==Contrast with stops and trills==
The main difference between a tap or flap and a stop is that in a tap/flap there is no buildup of air pressure behind the place of articulation and consequently no release burst. Otherwise a tap/flap is similar to a brief stop.

Taps and flaps also contrast with trills, where the airstream causes the articulator to vibrate. Trills may be realized as a single contact, like a tap or flap, but are variable, whereas a tap/flap is limited to a single contact. When a trill is brief and made with a single contact it is sometimes erroneously described as an (allophonic) tap/flap, but a true tap or flap is an active articulation whereas a trill is a passive articulation. That is, for a tap or flap the tongue makes an active gesture to contact the target place of articulation, whereas with a trill the contact is due to the vibration caused by the airstream rather than any active movement.

==Tap vs. flap==
Many linguists use the terms &quot;tap&quot; and &quot;flap&quot; interchangeably. Peter Ladefoged proposed for a while that it might be useful to distinguish between them. However, his usage was inconsistent and contradicted itself even between different editions of the same text. One proposed version of the distinction was that a tap strikes its point of contact directly, as a very brief stop, but a flap strikes the point of contact tangentially: &quot;Flaps are most typically made by retracting the tongue tip behind the alveolar ridge and moving it forward so that it strikes the ridge in passing.&quot;

Later, however, he used the term &quot;flap&quot; in all cases. Subsequent work on the labiodental flap has clarified the issue: flaps involve retraction of the active articulator, and a forward-striking movement.

For linguists who do not make the proposed distinction above, alveolars are typically called &quot;taps&quot;, and other articulations are called &quot;flaps&quot;.

A few languages have been reported to contrast a tap and a flap (as in the proposed definition cited above) at the same place of articulation. This is the case for Norwegian, in which the alveolar apical tap and the post-alveolar/retroflex apical flap have the same place of articulation for some speakers,
and Kamviri, which also has apical alveolar taps and flaps.

==IPA symbols==
The tap and flap consonants identified by the International Phonetic Alphabet are:

The Kiel Convention of the IPA recommended that for other taps and flaps, a homorganic consonant, such as a stop or trill, should be used with a breve diacritic:
However, the former could be mistaken for a short trill, and is more clearly transcribed , whereas for a nasal tap the unambiguous transcription is generally used.

==Types of taps and flaps==
Most of the alternative transcriptions in parentheses imply a tap rather than flap articulation, so for example the flap and the tapped stop are arguably distinct, as are flapped and tapped .

===Alveolar taps and flaps===

Spanish features a good illustration of an alveolar flap, contrasting it with a trill: &quot;pero&quot; &quot;but&quot; vs. &quot;perro&quot; &quot;dog&quot;. Among the Germanic languages, the tap allophone occurs in American and Australian English and in Northern Low Saxon. In American and Australian English it tends to be an allophone of intervocalic and , leading to homophonous pairs such as &quot;metal&quot; / &quot;medal&quot; and &quot;latter&quot; / &quot;ladder&quot; – see tapping. In a number of Low Saxon dialects it occurs as an allophone of intervocalic or ; e.g. &quot;bäden&quot; /beeden/ → &#x27;to pray&#x27;, &#x27;to request&#x27;, &quot;gah to Bedde!&quot; /gaa tou bede/ → &#x27;go to bed!&#x27;, &quot;Water&quot; → &#x27;water&#x27;, &quot;Vadder&quot; /fater/ → &#x27;father&#x27;. (In some dialects this has resulted in reanalysis and a shift to ; thus &quot;bären&quot; , &quot;to Berre&quot; , &quot;Warer&quot; , &quot;Varrer&quot; .) Occurrence varies; in some Low Saxon dialects it affects both and , while in others it affects only . Other languages with this are Portuguese, Korean, and Austronesian languages with .

In Galician, Portuguese and Sardinian, a flap often appears instead of a former . This is part of a wider phenomenon called rhotacism.

===Retroflex flaps===
Most Indic and Dravidian languages have retroflex flaps. In Hindi there are three, a simple retroflex flap as in &quot;big,&quot; a murmured retroflex flap as in &quot;leper,&quot; and a retroflex nasal flap in the Hindicized pronunciation of Sanskrit &quot;gem.&quot; Some of these may be allophonic.

A retroflex flap is also common in Norwegian dialects and some Swedish dialects.

===Lateral taps and flaps===
Many of the languages of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific that do not distinguish [r] from l may have a lateral flap. However, it is also possible that many of these languages do not have a lateral–central contrast at all, so that even a consistently neutral articulation may be perceived as sometimes lateral or , sometimes central . This has been suggested to be the case for Japanese, for example.

The Iwaidja language of Australia has both alveolar and retroflex lateral flaps. These contrast with lateral approximants at the same positions, as well as a retroflex tap , alveolar tap , and retroflex approximant . However, the flapped, or tapped, laterals in Iwaidja are distinct from &#x27;lateral flaps&#x27; as represented by the corresponding IPA symbols (see below). These phones consist of a flap component followed by a lateral component, whereas In Iwaidja the opposite is the case. For this reason, current IPA transcriptions of these sounds by linguists working on the language consist of an alveolar lateral followed by a superscript alveolar tap and a retroflex lateral followed by a superscript retroflex tap.

A velar lateral tap may exist as an allophone in a few languages of New Guinea, according to Peter Ladefoged and Ian Maddieson.

===Non-coronal flaps===
The only common non-coronal flap is the labiodental flap, found throughout central Africa in languages such as Margi. In 2005, the IPA adopted a right-hook v, :

Previously it had been transcribed with the use of the breve diacritic, , or other &quot;ad hoc&quot; symbols.

Other taps or flaps are much less common. They include an epiglottal tap; a bilabial flap in Banda, which may be an allophone of the labiodental flap; and a velar lateral tap as an allophone in Kanite and Melpa. These are often transcribed with the breve diacritic, as . Note here that, like a velar trill, a central velar flap or tap is not possible because the tongue and soft palate cannot move together easily enough to produce a sound.

If other flaps are found, the breve diacritic could be used to represent them, but would more properly be combined with the symbol for the corresponding voiced stop. A palatal or uvular tap or flap, which unlike a velar tap is believed to be articulatorily possible, could be represented this way (by ).

Though deemed impossible on the IPA chart, a velar tap has been reported to occur allophonically in the Kamviri dialect of the Kamkata-vari language and in Dàgáárè, though at least in the latter case this may in fact be a palatal tap.

===Nasal taps and flaps===
Nasalized consonants include taps and flaps, although these are rarely phonemic. In conversational (rather than carefully enunciated) speech, American English often features a nasal flap when /n/ or /nt/ are in intervocalic position before an unstressed vowel; for example, &quot;winner&quot; and &quot;winter&quot; become homophones: [&#x27;wɪ(~)ɾ̃ɚ]. Many West African languages have a nasal flap (or ) as an allophone of before a nasal vowel; Pashto, however, has a phonemic nasal retroflex lateral flap. As mentioned above, many Indo-Aryan languages also possess a phonemic retroflex nasal flap that contrasts with the alveolar nasal stop. 

===Tapped fricatives===
Voiced and voiceless tapped alveolar fricatives have been reported from a few languages. Flapped fricatives are possible but do not seem to be used. See voiced alveolar tapped fricative, voiceless alveolar tapped fricative.

<doc id="539631" wikidata="Q681620" url="?curid=539631" title="Villeneuve-lès-Maguelone">
<text>Villeneuve-lès-Maguelone (Occitan: &quot;Vilanòva de Magalona&quot;, before 1992: &quot;Villeneuve-lès-Maguelonne&quot;) is a commune in the Hérault department in the Occitanie region in Southern France. Villeneuve-lès-Maguelone station has rail connections to Narbonne, Montpellier and Avignon.

==Etymology==
The name Maguelone is a variation of Latin &quot;margarita&quot; (pearl), from Persian &quot;margaritis&quot; - in modern French the &quot;marguerite&quot; (daisy) took its name from the precious stone. The ending is probably a misattribution: &quot;-ita&quot; is a common Romance feminine diminutive suffix, equivalent in meaning to the Occitan &quot;-ona&quot;.

==History==

Maguelone (or Maguelon) was one of the &quot;seven cities&quot; that may have been the origin of the name for the region called Septimania. Septimania was the western region of the Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis, which passed under the control of the Visigothic kingdom in 462, when Septimania was ceded to Theodoric II, king of the Visigoths. The seven cities were today&#x27;s Elne, Agde, Narbonne, Lodève, Béziers, Nîmes and Maguelone.

In the aftermath of the Battle of Vouille (507), Maguelone managed to remain out of Frankish sway, and was part of the Visigothic kingdom. At first the stronghold of a Visigothic noble, on high ground protected by coastal lagoons, Maguelone became the seat of a bishop. When the early history of Maguelone was compiled in 1583 by Abbé Gariel (&quot;Histoire des évêques de Maguelonne&quot;) he provided the see with an apostolic origin, as is &quot;de rigueur&quot; for any long-established bishopric of Late Antiquity throughout the three Gauls. The first &quot;historical&quot; bishop of Maguelonne, Boetius, assisted at the Council of Toledo in 589; doubtless the Christian community was far older.

In the 8th century (circa 725) the Umayyad forces conquered the area, but the stronghold was destroyed by Charles Martel in his 737 campaign across Septimania, almost depopulating the region. The Gallo-Roman and Gothic nobility allied with the Andalusian military kept the position until 752, when Pepin the Short tipped the scale in favour of the Franks, who conquered Septimania.

The diocese was removed to Substantion (Sextantio), but Bishop Arnaud (1030–1060) returned it, rebuilt the destroyed sanctuary and constructed a bridge to link Maguelone to the &quot;new district&quot; of Villeneuve. The powerful and compact Romanesque Maguelone Cathedral, dedicated to Saint Peter, was constructed.
The local count retained the traditional Carolingian right of nomination of bishops: in 1085 Pierre, count of Substantion and Melgueil, offered himself as vassal of the Holy See and relinquished the right of nomination, and Innocent III transferred the feudal rights of the county to the bishop of Maguelonne in 1215, which gave the bishops the right to issue coinage. The bishop, as well as the King of Aragon and the Count of Toulouse, authorized the coinage of Arabic money, not intended for circulation in Maguelonne, but to be sold for exportation to the merchants of the Mediterranean.
With the expansion of trade in the revival of the High Middle Ages, Montpellier came to be the city for this region, first passing to the Crown of Aragon in 1204, then to that of France (1292 and 1349). In 1536 the see was finally transferred there.

A sentimental and chivalric romance of the high-born Miguelonne and Pierre, the son of the King of Provence, who recognized each other in their old age after many heartbreaking separations, inspired a verse: &quot;Epistle&quot; by Clément Marot.

For the history of the bishopric of Maguelonne, see Bishopric of Montpellier as the episcopal see was transferred there in 1536.

<text>Andrew James Bathgate (August 28, 1932 – February 26, 2016) was a Canadian professional ice hockey right wing who played 17 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the New York Rangers, Toronto Maple Leafs, Detroit Red Wings and Pittsburgh Penguins between 1952 and 1971. In 2017 Bathgate was named one of the &quot;100 Greatest NHL Players&quot; in history.

==Playing career==
As a youth Bathgate was offered scholarships to both the University of Denver and University of Colorado to join their hockey teams, but turned them down and instead joined the Guelph Biltmores of the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) in 1949.

Andy Bathgate was a popular star player of the New York Rangers and also held the honour of being declared the Most Valuable Player of both the NHL and Western Hockey League (WHL). He started his professional career with the Cleveland Barons of the American Hockey League (AHL) in the 1952–53 season. He bounced between the WHL&#x27;s Vancouver Canucks (not to be confused with the later NHL team of the same name) and the Rangers for two seasons before settling with the Rangers in 1954–55. He played 10 full seasons with the Rangers, where he became a popular player in New York as well as a top-tiered player in the NHL.

In 1961–62, Bathgate and Bobby Hull led the league in points, but Bathgate lost the Art Ross Trophy to Bobby Hull because Hull had more goals.

Bathgate&#x27;s career was frustrated by the mediocre play of the Rangers and a nagging knee problem. He was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs during the 1963–64 season, where he immediately helped Toronto to a Stanley Cup championship. In May 1965, the Maple Leafs traded Bathgate, Billy Harris, and Gary Jarrett to the Detroit Red Wings for Marcel Pronovost, Aut Erickson, Larry Jeffrey, Ed Joyal, and Lowell MacDonald who went to the Toronto Maple Leafs. Bathgate helped the team reach the Stanley Cup Finals in 1965–66. Bathgate was chosen by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 1967 NHL Expansion Draft, scoring the first goal in the team&#x27;s history. However after one season, he returned to the WHL&#x27;s Vancouver Canucks, where he would help lead the team to two consecutive Lester Patrick Cup victories, in 1969 and 1970. His best professional year was 1969-70, scoring 108 points for the Canucks. That performance earned him the George Leader Cup, the top player award in the WHL. Bathgate returned to the NHL&#x27;s Penguins, playing his last year of North American professional hockey for them in 1970-71.

He served in 1971–1972 as playing coach for HC Ambri-Piotta in Switzerland. He came briefly out of retirement three seasons later to play for the Vancouver Blazers of the World Hockey Association (WHA), which he had coached the previous season, but retired for good after 11 games.

Bathgate won the Hart Memorial Trophy for the MVP of the NHL in 1958–59 after scoring 40 goals. He is also known for his contribution to the in-game use of masks for goaltenders during games. Renowned for the strength of his slapshot, during a game against the Montreal Canadiens, Bathgate shot the puck into the face of Jacques Plante, forcing Plante to receive stitches. When Plante returned to the ice, he was wearing a mask. That started a trend that led to it and other protective gear becoming mandatory equipment.

===Stance against spearing===
In December 1959, Bathgate produced a controversial article for &quot;True&quot; magazine in which he warned that hockey&#x27;s &quot;unchecked brutality is going to kill somebody&quot;. The article, titled &quot;Atrocities on Ice&quot;, was ghostwritten by Dave Anderson, who was then a sports journalist with the now defunct &quot;New York Journal-American&quot;, and it appeared in &quot;True&quot; magazine&#x27;s January 1960 edition. Bathgate focused mostly on the tactic of spearing, where a player stabs at an opponent with the blade or point of his stick. In a section titled &quot;Andy Bathgate&#x27;s rogues gallery&quot;, six players were highlighted as the most brutal, with their photographs captioned with a short description by Bathgate. These were Detroit&#x27;s Gordie Howe (&quot;meanest player in the league; uses all the tricks—plus&quot;); Chicago&#x27;s Ted Lindsay (&quot;seldom drops his stick in a fight&quot;); Montreal&#x27;s Tom Johnson (&quot;one of the five notorious spearing specialists in the NHL&quot;); Montreal&#x27;s Doug Harvey (&quot;lucky he doesn&#x27;t have a spearing death on his conscience&quot;); Boston&#x27;s Fern Flaman (&quot;he&#x27;s had too many accidents to believe&quot;) and New York&#x27;s Lou Fontinato (&quot;likes to use the stick but uses his fists in a real fight&quot;).

Responding to the article, Toe Blake, the Montreal Canadiens&#x27; head coach, admitted that Montreal players used spearing, but claimed it was purely a defensive tactic &quot;necessary to defend against an illegal play pattern used often by the Rangers.&quot; Blake said: &quot;They like to skate into our zone against the defence and drop the puck for a teammate following right behind. Then they skate into our defenceman, blocking him out of the play illegally through interference. Our players have sometimes had to spear to fend off the interfering player and keep in play.&quot; Doug Harvey also admitted spearing, saying: &quot;Sure, we will spear on occasion. We&#x27;ve got to when they run interference,&quot; and that he used it &quot;only for defensive purposes.&quot;

Bathgate wrote of the offenders: &quot;None of them seems to care that he&#x27;ll be branded as a hockey killer.&quot; In response the NHL fined him for &quot;comments definitely prejudicial to the league and the game.&quot; Speaking in 2010, Bathgate said: &quot;We had an episode where fellas were spearing other players. So I wrote an article with Dave Anderson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; [sic] called &#x27;Atrocities on Ice.&#x27; Red Sullivan, I saw him speared right in front of our bench and have his spleen punctured. It was getting out of hand. I wrote this article and got fined for it. I got fined $1,000—and I was only making $18,000 at the time—so you take that, plus the $1,000 we had to pay into our pension, that&#x27;s a lot of money out of your pocket. They changed the rule at the end of the year but they still didn&#x27;t give me my $1,000 back. It burns my (butt) at times, but you have to stand up for it. Sometimes, you&#x27;ve got to speak up for the betterment of hockey because someone was going to get seriously hurt.&quot;

==Post-retirement==
Bathgate owned and managed a golf course called the Bathgate Golf Centre, while his brother Frank owned a driving range just down the road both on Hwy 10 in Mississauga, Ontario. During the winters he helped coach his grandson&#x27;s hockey team. He also stated that he was unlikely to play in any more old-timer&#x27;s games, citing recent hip surgery. &quot;Those old fellas get too serious. They&#x27;ll start hooking you.&quot;

The Rangers retired his #9 along with Harry Howell&#x27;s #3 in a special ceremony before the February 22, 2009, match against the Maple Leafs. Bathgate joined Adam Graves, whose #9 had been hoisted to the Madison Square Garden rafters 19 nights earlier. Graves called Bathgate &quot;the greatest Ranger to ever wear the #9&quot;.

==Personal life==
Bathgate was married to his wife Merle Lewis from 1955 until his death in 2016. They had two children, a son named Bill, and a daughter named Sandra Lynn “Sandee”.

Bathgate died at the age of 83 on February 26, 2016, in Brampton, Ontario. At the time of his death, he had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

Bathgate&#x27;s grandson and namesake, Andy Bathgate, born February 26, 1991, was drafted by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft and previously played for the Birmingham Bulls of the Southern Professional Hockey League.

<doc id="539634" wikidata="Q960666" url="?curid=539634" title="Fredonyer Pass">
<text>Fredonyer Pass, elevation , is a high mountain pass in Lassen County, California, southwest of Susanville and southeast of Mount Lassen. It lies on the Great Basin Divide between the Feather River to the west and the Susan River and Honey Lake to the east.

The pass is traversed by State Route 36 and has virtually the same elevation as Morgan Summit to the west (sources vary). It is subject to snowfall during the winter.

== Atlas Fredonyer ==
Fredonyer Pass received its name from Dr. Atlas Fredonyer, who discovered the pass in 1850.

Fredonyer was born in Switzerland in about 1832.
In 1850, he traveled through the Humboldt River, Black Rock Desert and High Rock Canyon. He and his companions decided not to take the Lassen Trail and instead headed southwest from High Rock and discovered what is now known as Fredonyer Pass.

In 1862, Fredonyer was convicted of incest and eventually pardoned by California Governor Leland Stanford. 
In 1880, Dr. Fredonyer died in San Francisco after colon surgery to remove a 16-ounce bottle that he had inadvertently lost inside his rectum after an attempt to alleviate a severe case of diarrhea.

== Geography ==
In the early 1900s, Fredonyer pass was known as Fredonia Pass.

In 1995, there was an unsuccessful move to rename Fredonyer Pass to honor of Deputy Sheriff Larry David Griffith, who was slain in the line of duty.

Fredonyer Pass is part of the approximate boundary between the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range. This irregular boundary is sometimes defined as the southern extent of Cenozoic igneous surface rock from the Cascade Range. This boundary roughly follows the drainage of the North Fork Feather River southeast to Fredonyer Pass. Note that there are other Cenozoic igneous rocks in the Sierra (e.g., near Lake Tahoe), but there is a clear geological division near Fredonyer Pass, and points westward as far as the Sacramento Valley.

<text>NFTY: The North American Federation for Temple Youth (formerly known as the National Federation for Temple Youth, often referred to simply as NFTY, commonly pronounced &quot;nifty&quot;) is the organized youth movement of Reform Judaism in North America (commonly making it referred to as The Reform Jewish Youth Movement). Funded and supported by the Union for Reform Judaism (URJ), NFTY exists to supplement and support Reform youth groups at the synagogue level. About 750 local youth groups affiliate themselves with the organization, comprising over 8,500 youth members.

NFTY is the North American branch of Netzer Olami, the worldwide Progressive Zionist Youth movement. This relationship was formalized at the biennial NFTY Convention in Los Angeles, California in February 2005.

==History==
Founded on January 15, 1939 by the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now called the Union for Reform Judaism), the then-titled National Federation of Temple Youth was a program to encourage college students to engage in synagogue life. NFTY was originally focused in three regions - New York City, Chicago, and Pennsylvania; it soon expanded to all areas of the UAHC. The first national officers were: Richard Bluestein, president; Bernard Sang, first vice president; Lewis Held, second vice president; Daniel Miller, third vice president; Lenore Cohn, secretary. The executive committee of NFTY met in June 1939 in New York and discussed college activities, publications and social justice while also confirming cooperation with the UAHC as an affiliate and to cooperate with the National Conference for Community and Justice in interfaith work.

Rabbi Sam Cook organized one of the first regional Labor Day Conclaves of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (UAHC) Pennsylvania State Federation, held at Pinemere Camp in 1939. The next convention was February 1940 in Chicago with former President Hoover as a Speaker. National conventions continued every two years until 1948 and the organization began to focus on High School aged students.
In the 1950s, NFTY began to focus on social action and mitzvah themes. Local, regional, and national social action efforts were commonplace on issues from the releases of Russian Jews to the fight against poverty to hunger. Mitzvah Corps groups were established in many regions.

In 1952, NFTY began Jewish summer camping in the newly purchased facility in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin later called the Olin-Sang-Ruby Union Institute Camp (or OSRUI). In 1964, the Kutz Camp in Warwick, New York became NFTY&#x27;s North American leadership camp and the site of North American board meetings. The successful Jewish camping movement expanded under the UAHC/URJ and NFTY to Jewish camps around the United States.

In 1961, NFTY began Israel programming with the URJ Heller High School (formerly Eisendrath International Exchange) semester in Israel. NFTY summer trips to Israel, often attended between sophomore and junior years of high school have been attended by thousands of Reform Jewish teenagers. Trips to Europe, mitzvah trips to locations such as Puerto Rico and Mexico, and archaeological digs have also been sponsored by NFTY in recent decades.

From 1962-1965, NFTY focused on innovation in international programming. The NFTY Summer Antiquities Tour brought NFTYites to see the sights and meet the Jewish youth of Europe and Israel. The NFTY Bible Institute provided a thorough touring experience in Israel. Mitzvah Corps programs sprung up in Puerto Rico, Israel, and Mexico, as well as in New York and Chicago. Today, almost every NFTY Region has a Mitzvah Corps Program.

In 1965, NFTY acquired a new summer address: its own national camp—the URJ Kutz Camp in Warwick, NY. Beginning that summer, Kutz became the site for NFTY&#x27;s Leadership Institutes, Board Meetings, and other national programs. It continues to be the headquarters for NFTY Leadership Training.

In 1983, NFTY reintroduced the NFTY Convention in Washington, D.C. Every other year on President&#x27;s Day weekend, hundreds to thousands of Reform Jewish teenagers gather for study, prayer, music, and socializing in a major North American city. A youth advisor&#x27;s professional training conference was added to run concurrently in 1999 with a youth clergy track added in 2001. Convention typically alternates between the East and West coast.

In the late 1980s at Mechina, a leadership training and policy setting gathering of the NFTY General Board, NFTY officially recognized itself as a North American movement, in response to a growing and influential Canadian population. 

In 2020 the URJ sold the property that Kutz Camp operated on to the town of Warwick, New York.

Past NFTYites and NFTY leadership can be found as numerous rabbis, cantors, educators, social workers, synagogue leaders, and active Reform Jews across the world.

==Mission==
Throughout the 2014–2015 NFTY year, the Regional Presidents Network drafted a new mission statement to reflect the cohesive values, aspirations, and goals of the North American Federation of Temple Youth. This mission statement was formally adopted by the NFTY Board, General Board, and adult leadership after being presented at the 2015 NFTY Convention in Atlanta. The mission statement reads as follows:

* NFTY is a movement that builds strong, welcoming, inspired communities through teen-powered engagement. Together, we pursue Tikkun Olam, personal growth, youth empowerment, and deep connections, all rooted in Reform Judaism.

==Structure ==
NFTY is divided into three levels: Temple Youth Group (TYG), Regional, and North American. At each level, authority is divided between elected youth boards and supervisors employed by the URJ or local synagogue. Boards vary widely between youth groups and regions, but typically include positions such as: President, Programming Vice-President, Social Action Vice-President, Religious &amp; Cultural Vice-President, Membership Vice-President, Communications Vice-President, Treasurer, and Secretary.

=== TYG Level ===
TYGs, or Temple Youth Groups, are individual youth groups affiliated with Reform congregations and are the foundation of NFTY. TYGs are youth-run and offer participants educational, social, action, and religious programs. Most TYGs have a youth group board and an adult advisor appointed by the congregation. The youth group advisor or director is sometimes a volunteer in the congregation, a parent, a part-time staff person, or, in a small, but increasing number of synagogues, a full-time position. While the board structure is at the direction of each group, most are modeled after the regional or North American board.

=== Regions ===
NFTY is divided into nineteen regions which hold events to bring together different TYGs based on geographical distribution. For example, NFTY-STR (Southern Tropical Region), the most populous region, includes around 30 TYGs and over 600 members.

Relations between regions range from friendly &quot;rivalry&quot; to &quot;alliance&quot; and are subject to combinations and divisions that occur due to membership fluctuation. For example:

* Until 2001, NFTY-SAR and NFTY-STR comprised one region, known as NFTY-SER (formerly known as SEFTY). The regions still work together to run certain social action projects. Additionally, until 2003/2004 NFTY-NAR (New York Area Region) comprised three regions, NFTY-NYC (New York City, formerly known as CRaFTY), NFTY-LI (Long Island, formerly known as LIFTY), and NFTY-W/F (Westchester/Fairfield and parts of Connecticut, formerly known as WooFTY). Additionally, a 21st region, NFTY-Central New York (formerly known as CNFTY) existed until 1995. In that year, the Central New York region, which included synagogues along the Hudson Valley from Rockland County, N.Y., north to Albany and west to Syracuse, N.Y., was split among the Northeast region, the Northeast Lakes region, and the New Jersey region (formerly known as JFTY).

 regions are:
*NFTY-CAR: Chicago Area Region
*NFTY-CWR: Central West Region

:Northern California, Nevada, Hawaii, and Utah.
*NFTY-GER: Garden-Empire Region
:Northern and Central New Jersey and parts of downstate New York.

: Maryland, the District of Columbia, Virginia, eastern West Virginia and parts of Northern North Carolina
*NFTY-MI: Michigan
*NFTY-MV: Missouri Valley

:Illinois (except Chicago), Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, and Wyoming.
*NFTY-NAR: the New York metropolitan area
:New York City, Westchester, Long Island, Fairfield County, Connecticut, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands
*NFTY-NE: Northeast

*NFTY-NEL: Northeast Lakes
:Around the Great Lakes (both in the US and Canada) including parts of the states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and all of Ontario, Canada.
*NFTY-NO: Northern
:Minnesota, Wisconsin, Rockford, Illinois, North and South Dakota, Saskatchewan, Manitoba
*NFTY-NW: Northwest
:It is physically the largest region, spanning Alaska, Alberta, British Columbia, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington.
*NFTY-OV: Ohio Valley

*NFTY-STR: Southern Tropical Region
:All of Florida outside of the panhandle, except Pensacola and the Bahamas
*NFTY-SW: Southwest
:Las Vegas, Arizona, New Mexico, El Paso
*NFTY-TOR: Texas-Oklahoma Region
:Texas and Oklahoma

==== Regional Leadership ====
Each region has an elected executive board of teens, who coordinate the efforts of temple youth groups, plan/assist regional events, improve marketing, and recruit new members. There is also an adult NFTY Regional Advisor, a paid staff position, who supervises the executive board and is a liaison with TYG advisors.

Each executive board consists of 6-10 teen members, each with a title and designated responsibilities. While each region&#x27;s board is slightly different, many positions are similar across North America. Some common positions are: President, Programming Vice President, Religious &amp; Cultural Vice President, Social Action Vice President, Membership Vice President, Communications Vice President, Financial Vice President.

== North American Involvement==
=== NFTY Board (North American Board)=== 
The NFTY board is elected each year to establish general policy and themes for the organization as a whole, as well as lead the various leadership networks. The board members are typically recent high school graduates, although there are occasional exceptions to this trend. 

[a]In 5774 (2014), the position of Membership &amp; Communications Vice President was split into Membership Vice President and Communications Vice President.

[b]In 5782 (2022) the position of Membership Vice President was renamed Engagement and Inclusion Vice President.

[c] In 5784 (2024) The position of Communications VP was changed to Correspondence VP

[d]In 5782 (2022) the position of Development Vice President was created by the North American Board.

[e]In 5783 (2023) there were no non-President individual positions. For the 2023-2024 year members of the Board were known as members of the North American Leadership Team

=== North American Gatherings=== 
Three North American gatherings were held: NFTY Convention (held every other year and open to all members), &quot;Mechina,&quot; and NFTY &quot;Veida&quot;, formerly known as Mid-Year Boards. &quot;Mechina&quot;, meaning preparation, was held every year for regional board members and includes a business meeting as well as networking and other activities to prepare for the coming year. &quot;Veida, &quot;held on non-convention years, was the annual business meeting for electing the incoming North American Board, selecting Study and Action Themes, and performing other business as needed. On convention years, the business of NFTY Veida was done during NFTY Convention.

== Names==

Originally, all NFTY regions were known by short acronyms ending in &quot;FTY&quot; (Federation of Temple Youth) such as LIFTY (Long Island Federation of Temple Youth) or OVFTY (Ohio Valley Federation of Temple Youth). Many synagogue youth groups had similar names based on the name of their city or synagogue.

In 1994, to create greater connection to the North American movement, the names of all NFTY regions became a two- or three- letter region specific abbreviation, preceded by &quot;NFTY-&quot;—thus, LIFTY became NFTY-LI, OVFTY became NFTY-OV (informally known as NFTY-(t)OV), JFTY became known as NFTY-GER (NFTY-Garden Empire Region) and PaFTY (Pennsylvania Federation of Temple Youth) became NFTY-PAR (NFTY-Pennsylvania Area Region). While resisted at first, regions adapted to the new names and sometime began to pronounce the geographic abbreviation. For example, TOFTY (Texas-Oklahoma Federation of Temple Youth) became NFTY-TOR (Texas-Oklahoma Region) and is often called simply &quot;TOR&quot; (pronounced &quot;tour&quot;). During the conversion, SEFTY became NFTY-SER, and then in 2001 split into two regions: NFTY-SAR (the previous Northern Region of SEFTY/NFTY-SER, plus the Jacksonville and Tallahassee TYGs) and NFTY-STR (the remainder of the Southern Region of SEFTY/NFTY-SER; STR is pronounced &quot;star&quot;).

==NFTY Convention==

NFTY Convention was a biennial convention for all of the NFTY regions and included 3 days (as of NFTY Convention 2017) of social, educational, charitable, and religious programming. The conventions also featured competitions in music, art, and oratory. Each convention was held in conjunction with the URJ Youth Workers Conference and a plenary session, or asefah, for regional board members.

==Music==
In NFTY&#x27;s early years, traditional Jewish and Yiddish melodies and spirituals such as &quot;Elijah Rock&quot; were common. In the 1950s, high school aged students sang songs composed by Hy Zaret and Lou Singer, such as &quot;Close Your Eyes and Point Your Finger&quot; and &quot;It Could Be a Wonderful World,&quot; in order to promote social consciousness in young people, and learned the dance steps and music popular on Israeli kibbutzim at the time, such as the water dance (&quot;Mayim Mayim&quot;).

In the 1960s, folk music became dominant with guitar playing teenaged song leaders leading youth in Pete Seeger, Peter, Paul &amp; Mary, and Bob Dylan songs, among others, as well as original compositions not usually recorded for posterity. Following the Six-Day War in Israel, a surge of Zionism in Jewish life pushed Hebrew, Israeli, Chasidic, and liturgically based songs to the forefront. The &quot;Mi Chamocha&quot; hymn, for example, was set by NFTY participants to the melody of Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;Redemption Song.&quot; Similarly, the traditional &quot;Adon Olam&quot; can be set to nearly any melody for any situation.

In 1968, Michael Isaacson introduced a NFTY Folk Service at the Kutz Camp demonstrating the growing trend of participatory, informal, mixed Hebrew/English services and song sessions that have remained the hallmark of a NFTY service. This style of American-born Jewish music came to be known as &quot;American Nusach&quot;. The first NFTY album, &quot;Songs NFTY Sings&quot; was produced at the then-UAHC Kutz Camp. It contained eight contemporary Jewish folk pieces and 10 songs from Isaacson&#x27;s Folk Service. The album, produced by Loui Dobin, now the director of Greene Family Camp, was quickly followed by 5 more albums: &quot;Shiru Shir Chadash&quot; (1973), &quot;Ten Shabbat V&#x27;Ten Shalom (Give Us Sabbath and Give Us Peace)&quot; (1974), &quot;Eit Hazmir, The Time of Singing&quot; (1977), and &quot;nfty at 40: this is very good&quot; (1980). In 1989, &quot;Fifty Years in the Making 1939–1989&quot; was released with new music and retrospective hits. The 7 albums are often also referred to as &quot;NFTY I&quot;, &quot;NFTY II&quot;, &quot;NFTY III&quot;, and so on. In 2003 all of the original 7 albums were re-released on compact disc in a 5-disc set &quot;The Complete NFTY Recordings 1972–1989&quot;.

Beginning in 2006 NFTY has released the &quot;Ruach&quot; compilation album series at biannual conventions, featuring contemporary Jewish artists on CD, many of them former NFTYites themselves: &quot;Ruach 5761&quot;, &quot;Ruach 5763&quot;, &quot;Ruach 5765&quot; (featuring music from and about Israel), &quot;Ruach 5767&quot;, &quot;Ruach 5769&quot;, &quot;Ruach 5771&quot;, and &quot;Ruach 5773&quot;. The series transitioned to a digital-only format in 2015. &quot;Ruach 5775&quot; was released digitally at NFTY Convention 2015 and &quot;Ruach 5777&quot; was released digitally at NFTY Convention 2017.

Performers popular within NFTY include Debbie Friedman, Kol B&#x27;Seder (Rabbi Danny Freelander and Cantor Jeff Klepper), Ramie and Merri Arian, Doug Mishkin, Peri Smilow, Julie Silver, Dan Nichols, Josh Nelson, Bryan Zive, Chana Rothman Noam Katz, Rick Recht, Alan Goodis, and Jacob &quot;Spike&quot; Kraus.

<text>The Grand River () is a tributary of the Missouri River in South Dakota in the United States. The length of the combined branch is 110 mi (177 km). With its longest fork, its length is approximately 200 mi (320 km).

==Variant names==
According to the Geographic Names Information System, it has also been known historically as:
*Creek of the Rees
*Marapa River
*Palanat Palanata Wakpa Ree
*Ree River
*Riviere au Corn
*We tar hoo River

==Course==
It is formed by the confluence of the North Fork (which rises in North Dakota) and the longer South Fork (which rises in South Dakota and passes through the town of Buffalo) in northwestern South Dakota near Shadehill in Perkins County, near several parcels of the Grand River National Grassland. Shadehill Reservoir is located at this confluence. It flows east, through the Standing Rock Indian Reservation and joins the Missouri in Lake Oahe, approximately northwest of Mobridge. The lower of the river form an arm of the Lake Oahe reservoir. It is the northernmost of South Dakota&#x27;s major West River streams: the Grand, Moreau, Cheyenne, Bad, and White. Draining about of the northern plateaus of the state, the Grand receives most of its water from snowmelt. Water quality is high in sodium, and is therefore less appropriate for irrigation. At Wakpala, the river has a mean annual discharge of 

==History==
In 1823, Henry Leavenworth fought the Arikara a few miles north of the mouth of the Grand River during the Arikara War.

Sitting Bull (1831–1890), a Hunkpapa Lakota holy man who led his people as a tribal chief, was born on the Grand River in or nearby Dakota Territory. Decades later, he was killed by Indian agency police on the Standing Rock Indian Agency at his camp near the Grand River, as the police tried to arrest him.

The forks of the Grand was the site of a noted 1823 attack by a grizzly bear on frontiersman Hugh Glass, the inspiration for the 2015 film The Revenant.

<doc id="539650" wikidata="Q320197" url="?curid=539650" title="Villeneuve-Loubet">
<text>Villeneuve-Loubet (; ; ) is a commune in the Alpes-Maritimes department in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region in Southeastern France. It lies between Cagnes-sur-Mer and Antibes, at the mouth of the river Loup, ten kilometres west of central Nice.

It was created by the joining two old villages: the old village of Villeneuve inland and the village of Loubet on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea. Its inhabitants are called &quot;Villeneuvois&quot;.

==Economy==
Villeneuve-Loubet is at the same time a seaside resort and part of the technology cluster or technopole of nearby Sophia Antipolis. Many companies of the tertiary sector being installed in the city.

==Culture==

Villeneuve-Loubet is the birthplace of the famous 19th century provençal chef, restaurateur, and culinary writer Auguste Escoffier, the author of the &quot;Guide Culinaire&quot; and the founder of French haute cuisine. Villeneuve-Loubet was also, from 1920 onwards, the home of Maréchal Philippe Pétain (1856–1951), the &quot;Hero of Verdun&quot; in World War I and chief of state of the Nazi-collaborationist État Français, commonly known as Vichy France, in World War II.

The writer and historian Jules Bertaut (1877–1959) died in Villeneuve-Loubet.
The sculptor Richard Aurili worked in Villeneuve-Loubet.

Marshall Philippe Pétain purchased a house called L&#x27;Ermitage in Villeneuve-Loubet circa 1920.

Villeneuve-Loubet was also the site of a battle in World War II when it was liberated by the First Special Service Force on 24 August 1944. The tower of the castle was damaged by a shell fired by the US Navy, and dozens of soldiers from both sides were killed or wounded. In 2006, the bodies of fourteen Germans who were killed during the fighting were discovered in a mass grave near the town by a local medical student.

<doc id="539663" wikidata="Q17021450" url="?curid=539663" title="New York Brickley Giants">
<text>The New York Giants (informally known as Brickley&#x27;s Giants and Brickley&#x27;s New York Giants) were a professional American football team with the American Professional Football Association (now the National Football League) whose only season played was in 1921. The team has also been referred to as the Brooklyn Giants and Brickley&#x27;s Brooklyn Giants. The Brickley&#x27;s Giants were the first of 17 professional football teams to represent New York City at one time or another. The team was founded in 1919 by Charles Brickley, who received All-American honors while at Harvard. Brickley&#x27;s Giants played two games in their only season, losing to the Buffalo All-Americans, 55–0, and the Cleveland Tigers, 17–0. It was the second-shortest-lived franchise in APFA/NFL history, behind only another former New York APFA team, the Tonawanda Kardex, who played only one game in the same 1921 season.

==History==

===1919 team===
The team was sponsored by the New York Giants professional baseball team, and coached by Brickley, a halfback who was generally considered the finest kicker of his day. Home games were to be played at the baseball Giants&#x27; home field, the Polo Grounds.

The team was formed with the intent of competing in 1919. However, after the team&#x27;s first practice, the 1919 schedule, that began with an opening day game against the Massillon Tigers, was scratched because of conflict with New York&#x27;s blue laws. In 1919 the city allowed professional baseball on Sunday and the Giants thought the law would also apply to football. However, it was ruled that professional football was still outlawed on Sundays, so the team disbanded.
===1921 team===
The APFA had played a showcase game between the Canton Bulldogs and the Buffalo All-Americans at the Polo Grounds in December 1920; 20,000 spectators witnessed the contest, a strong crowd for the nascent league.

The success of that game prompted the league to seek a New York City-based team for the 1921 season. The Giants thus reformed with the financial backing from boxing promoter, Billy Gibson. Aside from Brickley, the team had no college stars. Joining Charles with the Giants was his brother George Brickley, who played baseball as an outfielder with the Philadelphia Athletics. The 1921 version of the team played several exhibition games, but only two league games, losing to the Buffalo All-Americans in October, and again to the Cleveland Tigers that December. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the game against Jim Thorpe and his Cleveland Tigers, &quot;was lopsided and had little to excite even the most rabid of rooters.&quot; In between games between APFA clubs, the Giants played a number of non-league games against lesser teams. The franchise played two seasons as an independent and folded after the 1923 season. During their 1921 season, the Giants played their home games at Commercial Field and Ebbets Field, both located in Brooklyn, and the Polo Grounds, located in Manhattan.

==Legacy==
In 1925, with the NFL in need of a franchise in a large-city market that could be used to showcase the league, NFL President Joseph Carr traveled to New York City to offer Billy Gibson, the owner of the Brickley Giants, a new franchise.

Gibson declined Carr&#x27;s offer for a new franchise, but instead referred Carr to a long-time friend of his, Tim Mara: Mara accepted the offer, and established the modern-day New York Giants franchise.

Other than the name, there is no relation between the Brickley Giants and the modern New York Giants franchise.

<text>The administrative divisions of the Ottoman Empire were administrative divisions of the state organisation of the Ottoman Empire. Outside this system were various types of vassal and tributary states.

The Ottoman Empire was first subdivided into provinces, in the sense of fixed territorial units with governors appointed by the sultan, in the late 14th century. The beylerbey, or governor, of each province was appointed by the central government. &quot;Sanjaks&quot; (banners) were governed by sanjak-beys, selected from the high military ranks by the central government. Beylerbeyis had authority over all the sancakbeyis in a region. Kaza was a subdivision of sancak and referred to the basic administrative district, governed by a kadi.

It is considered extremely difficult to define the number and exact borders of Ottoman provinces and domains, as their borders were changed constantly. Until the Tanzimat period from 1839 to 1876, the borders of administrative units fluctuated, reflecting the changing strategies of the Ottomans, the emergence of new threats in the region, and the rise of powerful ayans. All the subdivisions were very unequal in regard of area and population, and the presence of numerous nomadic tribes contributed to the extreme variability of the population figures.

==List of types==

In English, Ottoman subdivisions are seldom known by myriad Turkish terms (vilayet, eyalet, beylerbeylik, sancak, nahiye, kaza, etc.) which are often eschewed in favour of the English-language denomination (e.g. &quot;province&quot;, &quot;county&quot;, or &quot;district&quot;) that is perceived to be the closest to the Turkish original. These translations are rarely consistent between the works of different scholars, however.
Sanjaks were further divided into &quot;timars&quot; (fiefs held by &quot;timariots&quot;), kadiluks (the area of responsibility of a judge, or Kadi) and (also ; larger ).

==Initial organization (pre-1362)==

The initial organization dates back to the Ottoman beginnings as a Seljuk vassal state (&quot;Uç Beyligi&quot;) in central Anatolia. The Ottoman Empire over the years became an amalgamation of pre-existing polities, the Anatolian beyliks, brought under the sway of the ruling House of Osman.

This extension was based on an already established administrative structure of the Seljuk system in which the hereditary rulers of these territories were known as &quot;beys&quot;. These beys (local leadership), which were not eliminated, continued to rule under the suzerainty of the Ottoman sultans. The term bey came to be applied not only to these former rulers but also to new governors appointed where the local leadership had been eliminated.

The Ottoman Empire was, at first, subdivided into the sovereign&#x27;s &quot;sanjak&quot; and other sanjaks entrusted to the Ottoman sultan&#x27;s sons. Sanjaks were governed by &quot;sanjakbeys&quot;, military governors who received a flag or standard – a &quot;sanjak&quot; (the literal meaning) – from the sultan.

As the Empire expanded into Europe, the need for an intermediate level of administration arose and, under the rule of Murad I (r. 1359-1389), a &quot;beylerbey&quot; (&quot;bey of beys&quot;) or governor-general was appointed to oversee Rumelia, the European part of the empire. At the end of the 14th century, a &quot;beylerbeylik&quot; was also established for Anatolia, with his capital at Kütahya. He was always considered inferior in rank to the &quot;beylerbey&quot; of Rumelia, since large areas nominally under his control were given to the ruler&#x27;s sons.

Following the establishment of &quot;beylerbeyliks&quot;, &quot;sanjaks&quot; became second-order administrative divisions, although they continued to be of the first order in certain circumstances such as newly conquered areas that had yet to be assigned a &quot;beylerbey&quot;. In addition to their duties as governors-general, &quot;beylerbeys&quot; were the commanders of all troops in their province.

Following the conquests between 1362 and 1400 of Murad I and his son Bayezid I, a need arose for the formal organisation of Ottoman territory.

==Administrative hierarchy==
===First-level divisions===
There were two main eras of administrative organisation. The first was the initial organisation that evolved with the rise of the Empire and the second was the organisation after extensive administrative reforms of 1864.

====Eyalets (1362–1864)====

An &quot;eyalet&quot; (also &quot;pashalik&quot; or &quot;beylerbeylik&quot;) was the territory of office of a &quot;beylerbey&quot;, and was further subdivided in &quot;sanjaks&quot;. Toward the end of the 16th century, the &quot;beylerbeyliks&quot; began to be known as &quot;eyalets&quot;. The &quot;beylerbeyliks&quot; where the &quot;timar&quot; system was not applied, such as Habesh, Algers, Egypt, Baghdad, Basra and Lahsa, were more autonomous than the others. Instead of collecting provincial revenues through the timariot &quot;sipahis&quot;, the &quot;beylerbey&quot; transferred fixed annual sums to Istanbul, known as the &quot;salyane&quot;.

====Vilayets (1864–1922)====


The Vilayets were introduced with the promulgation of the &quot;Vilayet Law&quot; () in 1864, as part of the administrative reforms of the Tanzimat period that were being enacted throughout the empire.

Unlike the previous eyalet system, the 1864 law established a hierarchy of administrative units: the vilayet, liva/sanjak (cf. Liwa (Arabic)), kaza and village council, to which the 1871 Vilayet Law added the nahiye. The 1864 law also specified the responsibilities of the governor (wali) of the vilayet and their councils. At the same time, the law left to the governors vast scope for independent action as well as responsibility, as part of a system intended to achieve a large degree of efficiency in ruling the provinces.

The new provincial system could not be introduced in provinces at the same time, due to both insufficient funds and a lack of experience in administering the new law. Therefore, the new Danube Vilayet, composed of the former eyalets of Silistria, Vidin, and Nis, was selected to be the pilot project. Midhat Pasha and Cevdet Pasha were particularly successful in applying the new law in the Vilayets of Danube and Aleppo, respectively.

By 1865 the four vilayets of Danube, Aleppo, Erzurum and Bosnia were fully organized and in operation. Damascus, Tripolitania, and Edirne followed the next year. In 1867, 13 new vilayets were organized, including Bursa, Izmir, Trabzon, Salonica, Prizren, and Iskodra, with an autonomous Crete being organized as a vilayet by Ali Pasha in 1871. By the end of 1876 the new provincial system was in operation all over the empire, with the sole exception of the Arabian Peninsula and autonomous provinces like Egypt.

Mahmud Nedim Pasha reduced the size of some of the larger provinces, thus taking Sofia from the Danube Vilayet, Sebinkarahisar from Trabzon, and Maras from Adana and making them into separate provinces, and also taking Herzegovina from Bosnia and joining it with Novipazar in a new province.

===Second-level divisions (sanjaks)===

The provinces (eyalets, later vilayets) were divided into sanjaks (also called &quot;livas&quot;) governed by sanjakbeys (also called &quot;Mutesarrifs&quot;) and were further subdivided into &quot;timars&quot; (fiefs held by &quot;timariots&quot;), kadiluks (the area of responsibility of a judge, or Kadi) and (also ; larger timars).

===Third-level divisions===

Sanjaks were divided into kazas, along with other divisions. The position of kazas in the administrative hierarchy was clarified after 1839. 

==Governors==

===Beylerbey===
The Turkish word for governor-general is Beylerbey, meaning &#x27;lord of lords&#x27;. In times of war, they would assemble under his standard and fight as a unit in the sultan&#x27;s army. However, as a territorial governor, the Beylerbey now had wider responsibilities. He played the major role in allocating fiefs in his eyalet, and had a responsibility for maintaining order and dispensing justice. His household, like the sultan&#x27;s in the capital, was the political centre of the eyalet. By the mid-16th century, apart from the principalities north of the Danube, all eyalets came under the direct rule of the sultan. The Beylerbeys were all his appointees, and he could remove or transfer them at will. Their term of office was limited: governorships were not hereditary, and no one could serve for life.

The office of Beylerbey was the most prestigious and the most profitable in the provincial government, and it was from among the Beylerbeys that the sultan almost always chose his viziers. There was also, it appears, a hierarchy among the governors themselves. The senior was the Beylerbey of Rumelia who, from 1536, had the right to sit on the Imperial Council. Precedence among the remainder, according to Ayn Ali in 1609, followed the order in which the eyalets were conquered, although he does not make it clear whether this ranking had anything other than a ceremonial significance. However, before 1650, there was another development. During this period, the practice began of appointing some Beylerbeys with the rank of vizier. A vizieral governor, according to the chancellor Abdurrahman Pasha in 1676, had command over the governors of adjoining eyalets who &#x27;should have recourse to him and obey his command&#x27;. Furthermore, &#x27;when Beylerbeys with Vizierates are dismissed from their eyalet, they listen to lawsuits and continue to exercise Vizieral command until they reach Istanbul&#x27;.

===Sanjak-bey===
The office of Sanjak-bey resembled that of Beylerbey on a more modest scale. Like the Beylerbey, the Sanjak-bey drew his income from a prebend, which consisted usually of revenues from the towns, quays and ports within the boundary of his sanjak.

Like the Beylerbey, the Sanjak-bey was also a military commander. The term sanjak means &#x27;flag&#x27; or &#x27;standard&#x27; and, in times of war, the cavalrymen holding fiefs in his sanjak, gathered under his banner. The troops of each sanjak, under the command of their governor, would then assemble as an army and fight under the banner of the Beylerbey of the eyalet. In this way, the structure of command on the battlefield resembled the hierarchy of provincial government. Within his own sanjak, a governor was responsible above all for maintaining order and, with the cooperation of the fief holders, arresting and punishing wrongdoers. For this, he usually received half of the fines imposed on miscreants, with the fief holder on whose lands the misdeed took place, receiving the other half. Sanjak governors also had other duties, for example, the pursuit of bandits, the investigation of heretics, the provision of supplies for the army, or the despatch of materials for shipbuilding, as the sultan commanded.

Sanjak governors also served as military commanders of all of the timariot and -holding cavalrymen in their sanjak. Some provinces such as Egypt, Baghdad, Abyssinia, and Al-Hasa (the salyane provinces) were not subdivided into sanjaks and timars. The area governed by an Aga was often known as an Agaluk. The term Arpalik (), or Arpaluk, refers to large estate (i.e. sanjak) entrusted to some holder of senior position, or to some margrave, as temporary arrangement before they were appointed to some appropriate position. The barleycorn was known as &quot;arpa&quot; in Turkish, and the feudal system in Ottoman Empire employed the term Arpalik, or &quot;barley-money&quot;, to refer to a second allowance made to officials to offset the costs of fodder for their horses (for covering the expenses of keeping a small unit of cavalry).

<text>Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings (August 8, 1896 – December 14, 1953) was an American writer who lived in rural Florida and wrote novels with rural themes and settings. Her best known work, &quot;The Yearling—&quot;about a boy who adopts an orphaned fawn—won a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1939 and was later made into a movie of the same name. The book was written before the concept of young adult fiction arose but is now commonly included in teen reading lists.

==Early life and education==
Kinnan was born in 1896 in Washington, D.C., the daughter of Ida May (née Traphagen) and Arthur Frank Kinnan, an attorney for the U.S. Patent Office. She grew up in the Brookland neighborhood and was interested in writing as early as age six; she submitted stories to the children&#x27;s sections of newspapers until she was 16. At age 15, she entered into a contest a story titled &quot;The Reincarnation of Miss Hetty&quot;, for which she won a prize.

She attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where she joined Kappa Alpha Theta sorority and received a degree in English in 1918. She was selected as a member of the local senior women&#x27;s honor society on campus, which in 1920 became a chapter of the national senior women&#x27;s society, Mortar Board. She met Charles Rawlings while working for the school literary magazine, and married him in 1919. Kinnan briefly worked for the YWCA editorial board in New York City. The couple moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where they both wrote for the &quot;Courier Journal&quot;, and then to Rochester, New York, where they wrote for the &quot;Rochester Journal-American&quot; and where Marjorie wrote a syndicated column called &quot;Songs of the Housewife&quot;.

In 1928, with a small inheritance from her mother, the Rawlings purchased a 72-acre (290,000 m2) orange grove near Hawthorne, Florida, in a settlement named Cross Creek for its location between Orange Lake and Lochloosa Lake. She brought the area to international fame through her writing. She was fascinated with the remote wilderness and the lives of Cross Creek residents, her Florida cracker neighbors, and felt a profound and transforming connection to the region and the land. Wary at first, the local residents soon warmed to her and opened up their lives and experiences to her. Marjorie actually made many visits to meet with Calvin and Mary Long to observe their family relationships. This relationship ended up being used as a model for the family in her most successful novel, &quot;The Yearling.&quot; The Longs lived in a clearing named Pat&#x27;s Island, but Marjorie renamed the clearing &quot;Baxter&#x27;s Island.&quot; Marjorie filled several notebooks with descriptions of the animals, plants, Southern dialect, and recipes, and she used these descriptions in her writings.

==Career==
===Author and writer===
Encouraged by her editor at Scribner&#x27;s, Maxwell Perkins, who was impressed by the letters she wrote him about her life in Cross Creek, Rawlings began writing stories set in the nearby Big Scrub. In 1930, Scribner&#x27;s accepted two of her stories, &quot;Cracker Chidlings&quot; and &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;, both about the poor, backcountry Florida residents who were quite similar to her neighbors at Cross Creek. Local reception to her stories was mixed between puzzlement concerning about whom she was writing, and rage—one mother apparently recognized her son as a subject in a story and threatened to whip Rawlings until she was dead.

Her first novel, &quot;South Moon Under&quot;, was published in 1933. The book captures the richness of the Big Scrub and its environs in telling the story of a young man, Lant, who must support himself and his mother by making and selling moonshine, and what he must do when a traitorous cousin threatens to turn him in. Moonshiners are the subject of several of her stories, and Rawlings lived with a moonshiner for several weeks near Ocala, Florida, to prepare for writing the book. &quot;South Moon Under&quot; was included in the Book of the Month Club and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. That same year, she and her husband Charles were divorced; living in rural Florida did not appeal to him. One of her least well-received books, &quot;Golden Apples&quot;, came out in 1935. It tells the stories of several people who suffer from unrequited love from people unsuited for them. Rawlings was disappointed in it, and in a 1935 letter to her publisher Max Perkins, she called it &quot;interesting trash instead of literature.&quot;

She found immense success in 1938 with &quot;The Yearling&quot; (also set in the Big Scrub), a story about a Florida boy and his pet deer and his relationship with his father, which she originally intended as a story for young readers. It was selected for the Book of the Month Club, and it won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1939. MGM purchased the rights to the film version which was released in 1946, and it made her famous. In 1942, Rawlings published &quot;Cross Creek&quot;, an autobiographical account of her relationships with her neighbors and her beloved Florida hammocks. &quot;Cross Creek&quot; also was chosen by the Book of the Month Club and was released in an armed services edition (D-112), which was sent to servicemen during World War II. In addition &quot;The Yearling&quot; (B-55 and S-33) and &quot;South Moon Under&quot; (724) were published in the Armed Services Editions series.

Rawlings&#x27;s final novel, &quot;The Sojourner&quot;—published in 1953 and set in the north—was about the life of a man and his relationship to his family: a difficult mother who favors her other, first-born son and his relationship to this absent older brother. To absorb the natural setting so vital to her writing, she bought an old farmhouse in Van Hornesville, New York, and spent part of each year there until her death. The novel was less well-received critically than her Florida writings and did little to enhance her literary reputation. She published 33 short stories from 1912 to 1949. As many of Rawlings&#x27;s works were centered in the northern and central Florida area, she was often considered a regional writer. Rawlings rejected this label saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t hold any brief for regionalism, and I don&#x27;t hold with the regional novel as such … don&#x27;t make a novel about them unless they have a larger meaning than just quaintness.&quot;

===Invasion of privacy case===
In 1943, Rawlings faced a libel suit for &quot;Cross Creek&quot;, filed by her neighbor Zelma Cason, whom Rawlings had met the first day she moved to Florida. Cason had helped to soothe the mother made upset by her son&#x27;s depiction in &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;. Cason claimed Rawlings made her out to be a &quot;hussy&quot;. Rawlings had assumed their friendship was intact and spoke with her immediately. Cason went ahead with the lawsuit seeking $100,000 for invasion of privacy (as the courts found libel too ambiguous). It was a cause of action that had never been argued in a Florida court.

Rawlings used Cason&#x27;s forename in the book but described her in this passage:Zelma is an ageless spinster resembling an angry and efficient canary. She manages her orange grove and as much of the village and county as needs management or will submit to it. I cannot decide whether she should have been a man or a mother. She combines the more violent characteristics of both and those who ask for or accept her ministrations think nothing at being cursed loudly at the very instant of being tenderly fed, clothed, nursed, or guided through their troubles.

Cason was represented by Kate Walton, one of the first female attorneys in Florida. Cason was reportedly profane indeed (one of her neighbors reported her swearing could be heard for a quarter of a mile), wore pants, had a fascination with guns, and was just as extraordinarily independent as Rawlings. Rawlings won the case and enjoyed a brief vindication, but the verdict was overturned in appellate court, and Rawlings was ordered to pay damages in the amount of one dollar. The toll the case took on Rawlings was great, in both time and emotion. Reportedly, Rawlings had been shocked to learn of Cason&#x27;s reaction to the book and felt betrayed. After the case was over, she spent less time in Cross Creek and never wrote another book about Florida, though she had been considering doing a sequel to &quot;Cross Creek.&quot;

===GeeChee===
In &quot;Cross Creek&quot;, Rawlings describes how she owns 72 acres of land and also hires several people over the years to help her with day-to-day chores and activities. An entire chapter of the book is dedicated to one woman she hires, whose name was Beatrice but who was affectionately known as &quot;GeeChee&quot;, because the woman was ethnically part of the Geechee people. In the book, Rawlings says GeeChee&#x27;s mother lived in nearby Hawthorne and that GeeChee was blind in one eye from a fight in which she had been involved. GeeChee is employed by Rawlings on and off for nearly two years in which GeeChee dutifully makes life easier for Rawlings. 

GeeChee reveals to Rawlings that her boyfriend named Leroy was serving time in prison for manslaughter and asks Rawlings for help in gaining his release. She arranges for Leroy to be paroled to her and come work for her farm, and she has a wedding on the grounds for Beatrice and Leroy. After a few weeks, Leroy aggressively demands more earnings from Rawlings and threatens her. She decides he must leave, which causes her distress because she does not want GeeChee to go with him. GeeChee eventually decides to stay with Rawlings but then begins to drink heavily and abandons her. Weeks later, Rawlings searches for GeeChee, finds her, and drives her back to the farm, describing GeeChee as a &quot;Black Florence Nightingale&quot;. GeeChee is unable to stop herself from drinking, which leads a heartbroken Rawlings to dismiss her. Rawlings states in her autobiography &quot;No maid of perfection—and now I have one—can fill the strange emptiness she left in a remote corner of my heart. I think of her often, and I know she does of me, for she comes once a year to see me&quot;.

When &quot;Cross Creek&quot; was turned into a 1983 film, actress Alfre Woodard was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as GeeChee.

==Personal life==

With the money she made from &quot;The Yearling&quot;, Rawlings bought a beach cottage at Crescent Beach, ten miles south of St. Augustine. In 1941, Rawlings married Ocala hotelier Norton Baskin (1901–1997), and he remodeled an old mansion into the Castle Warden Hotel in St. Augustine, which currently houses the Ripley&#x27;s Believe it or Not Museum. After World War II, he sold the hotel and managed the Dolphin Restaurant at Marineland, which was then Florida&#x27;s number one tourist attraction. Rawlings and Baskin made their primary home at Crescent Beach, and they continued their respective occupations independently. When a visitor to the Castle Warden Hotel suggested she saw the influence of Rawlings in the decor, Baskin protested, saying, &quot;You do not see Mrs. Rawlings&#x27; fine hand in this place. Nor will you see my big foot in her next book. That&#x27;s our agreement. She writes. I run a hotel.&quot; After purchasing her land in New York, Rawlings spent half the year there and half the year with Baskin in St. Augustine.

Her singular admitted vanity was cooking. She said, &quot;I get as much satisfaction from preparing a perfect dinner for a few good friends as from turning out a perfect paragraph in my writing.&quot; Rawlings befriended and corresponded with Mary McLeod Bethune and Zora Neale Hurston. Hurston visited her at Cross Creek. Rawlings resisted social norms of the time in allowing Hurston, an African-American, to sleep in her home instead of relegating her to the tenant house. Rawlings&#x27;s views on race relations were very different from her neighbors&#x27;, castigating white Southerners for infantilizing African Americans and labeling their economic differences with whites &quot;a scandal&quot;, but simultaneously considering whites superior. She described her African-American employee Idella as &quot;the perfect maid&quot;. Their relationship is described in the book &quot;Idella: Marjorie Rawlings&#x27; &quot;Perfect Maid&quot;&quot;, by Idella Parker and Mary Keating.

Biographers have noted her longing for a male child through her writings, as far back as her first story as a teenage girl in &quot;The Reincarnation of Miss Hetty&quot;, and repeated throughout several works, letters, and characters, most notably in &quot;The Yearling&quot;. In fact, she stated that as a child she had a gift for telling stories but that she demanded all her audiences be boys. Her hatred of cities was intense: she wrote a sonnet titled, &quot;Having Left Cities Behind Me&quot; published in &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot; in 1938 to illustrate it (excerpt):Now, having left cities behind me, turnedAway forever from the strange, gregariousHuddling of men by stones, I find those variousGreat towns I knew fused into one, burned
Together in the fire of my despising ...

She was criticized throughout her career for being uneven with her talent in writing, something she recognized in herself, and that reflected periods of depression and artistic frustration. She has been described as having unique sensibilities; she wrote of feeling &quot;vibrations&quot; from the land and often preferred long periods of solitude at Cross Creek. She was known for being remarkably strong-willed, but after her death, Norton Baskin wrote of her: &quot;Marjorie was the shyest person I have ever known. This was always strange to me as she could stand up to anybody in any department of endeavor but time after time when she was asked to go some place or to do something she would accept—&#x27;if I would go with her.

===Death and legacy===
Rawlings died on December 14, 1953, in St. Augustine of a cerebral hemorrhage. She bequeathed most of her property to the University of Florida in Gainesville, where she taught creative writing in Anderson Hall. In return, her name was given to a dormitory dedicated in 1958 as Rawlings Hall. Her land at Cross Creek is now the Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings Historic State Park. Baskin survived her by 44 years, passing away in 1997. They are buried side by side at Antioch Cemetery near Island Grove, Florida. Her tombstone, with Baskin&#x27;s inscription, reads: &quot;Through her writing she endeared herself to the people of the world.&quot;

Rawlings&#x27; reputation has managed to outlive those of many of her contemporaries. A posthumously published children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Secret River&quot;, won a Newbery Honor in 1956, and movies were made long after her death of &quot;Gal Young Un&quot; and &quot;Cross Creek&quot; (Baskin made a cameo appearance in &quot;Cross Creek&quot; as a man sitting in a rocking chair). In 1986, Rawlings was inducted into the Florida Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame. In 1989 she won the Florida Folk Heritage Award. In 2008, the United States Postal Service unveiled a stamp bearing Rawlings&#x27;s image. She was named a Great Floridian in 2009; the program honors persons who made “major contributions to the progress and welfare&quot; of Florida.

Several public schools in Florida have been named in her honor, including Rawlings Elementary School in Gainesville, PVPV/Rawlings Elementary School in Ponte Vedra Beach and Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings Elementary in Pinellas Park.

<text>The North Fork of the Grand River is a tributary of the Grand River, approximately 80 miles (129 km) long, in North Dakota and South Dakota in the United States.

It rises in the Badlands of southwestern North Dakota, in southern Bowman County, and flows ESE, into the Bowman-Haley Reservoir, formed by the Bowman-Haley Dam, then through northwestern South Dakota, past several units of the Grand River National Grassland in northern Perkins County. It joins the South Fork near Shadehill to form the Grand.

<doc id="539672" wikidata="Q2192542" url="?curid=539672" title="History of the United States (1789–1815)">
<text>The history of the United States from 1789 to 1815 was marked by the nascent years of the American Republic under the new U.S. Constitution.

George Washington was elected the first president in 1789. On his own initiative, Washington created three departments, State (led by Thomas Jefferson), Treasury (led by Alexander Hamilton), and War (led at first by Henry Knox). The secretaries, along with a new Attorney General, became the cabinet. Based in New York City, the new government acted quickly to rebuild the nation&#x27;s financial structure. Enacting Hamilton&#x27;s program, the government assumed the Revolutionary War debts of the states and the national government, and refinanced them with new federal bonds. It paid for the program through new tariffs and taxes; the tax on whiskey led to a revolt in the west; Washington raised an army and suppressed it with minimal violence. The nation adopted a Bill of Rights as 10 amendments to the new constitution. Fleshing out the Constitution&#x27;s specification of the judiciary as capped by a Supreme Court, the Judiciary Act of 1789 established the entire federal judiciary. The Supreme Court became important under the leadership of Chief Justice John Marshall (1801–1835), a federalist and nationalist who built a strong Supreme Court and strengthened the national government.

The 1790s were highly contentious. The First Party System emerged in the contest between Hamilton and his Federalist party, and Thomas Jefferson and his Republican party. Washington and Hamilton were building a strong national government, with a broad financial base, and the support of merchants and financiers throughout the country. Jeffersonians opposed the new national Bank, the Navy, and federal taxes. The Federalists favored Britain, which was embattled in a series of wars with France. Jefferson&#x27;s victory in 1800 opened the era of Jeffersonian democracy, and doomed the upper-crust Federalists to increasingly marginal roles.

The Louisiana Purchase from Napoleon in 1803 opened vast Western expanses of fertile land, which exactly met the needs of the rapidly expanding population of yeomen farmers whom Jefferson championed.

The Americans declared war on Britain in the War of 1812 to uphold American honor at sea, and to end the Indian raids in the west, as well as to temporarily seize Canadian territory as a negotiating chip. Secretary of State James Monroe said in June 1812, &quot;It might be necessary to invade Canada, not as an object of the war but to bring it to a satisfactory conclusion.&quot; Despite incompetent government management, and a series of defeats early on, Americans found new generals like Andrew Jackson, William Henry Harrison, and Winfield Scott, who repulsed British invasions and broke the alliance between the British and the Indians that held up settlement of the Old Northwest. The Federalists, who had opposed the war to the point of trading with the enemy and threatening secession, were devastated by the triumphant ending of the war. The remaining Indians east of the Mississippi River were kept on reservations or moved via the Trail of Tears to reservations in what later became Oklahoma.

==Federalist Era==


===Washington administration: 1789–1797===

George Washington, a renowned hero of the American Revolution, commander of the Continental Army, and president of the Constitutional Convention, was unanimously chosen as the first president of the United States under the new U.S. Constitution. All the leaders of the new nation were committed to republicanism, and the doubts of the Anti-Federalists of 1788 were allayed with the passage of a Bill of Rights as the first ten amendments to the Constitution in 1791.

The first census enumerated a population of 3.9 million. Only 12 cities had populations of more than 5,000; most people were farmers.

The Constitution assigned Congress the task of creating inferior courts. The Judiciary Act of 1789 established the entire federal judiciary. The act provided for the Supreme Court to have six justices, and for two additional levels: three circuit courts and 13 district courts. It also created the offices of U.S. Marshal, Deputy Marshal, and District Attorney in each federal judicial district. The Compromise of 1790 located the national capital in a district to be defined in the South (the District of Columbia), and enabled the federal assumption of state debts.

The key role of Secretary of the Treasury was awarded to Washington&#x27;s wartime &quot;aide-de-camp&quot;, Alexander Hamilton. With Washington&#x27;s support and against Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s opposition, Hamilton convinced Congress to pass a far-reaching financial program that was patterned after the system developed in England a century earlier. It funded the debts of the Revolutionary War, set up a national bank, and set up a system of tariffs and taxes. His policies linked the economic interests of the states, and of wealthy Americans, to the success of the national government, and enhanced the international financial standing of the new nation.

Most Representatives of the South opposed Hamilton&#x27;s plan because they had already repudiated their debts and thus gained little from it. There were early signs of the economic and cultural rift between the Northern and Southern states that was to burst into flames seven decades later: the South and its plantation-based economy resisted a centralized federal government and subordination to Northeastern business interests. Despite considerable opposition in Congress from Southerners, Hamilton&#x27;s plan was moved into effect during the middle of 1790. The First Bank of the United States was thus created that year despite arguments from Thomas Jefferson and his supporters that it was unconstitutional while Hamilton declared that it was entirely within the powers granted to the federal government. Hamilton&#x27;s other proposals, including protection tariffs for nascent American industry, were defeated.

The Whiskey Rebellion broke out in 1794 when settlers in the Monongahela Valley of western Pennsylvania protested against the new federal tax on whiskey, which the settlers shipped across the mountains to earn money. It was the first serious test of the federal government. Washington ordered federal marshals to serve court orders requiring the tax protesters to appear in federal district court. By August 1794, the protests became dangerously close to outright rebellion, and on August 7, several thousand armed settlers gathered near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Washington then invoked the Militia Law of 1792 to summon the militias of several states. A force of 13,000 men was organized, and Washington led it to Western Pennsylvania. The revolt immediately collapsed without violence.

Foreign policy unexpectedly took center stage starting in 1793, when revolutionary France became engulfed in war with the rest of Europe, an event that was to lead to 22 years of fighting. France claimed that its 1778 alliance with the U.S. meant that the U.S. was bound to come to their aid. The Washington administration&#x27;s policy of neutrality was widely supported, but the Jeffersonians strongly favored France and deeply distrusted the British, who they saw as enemies of republicanism. In addition, they sought to annex Spanish territory in the South and West. Meanwhile, Hamilton and the business community favored Britain, which was by far America&#x27;s largest trading partner. The Republicans gained support in the winter of 1793–94 as the Royal Navy impressed alleged deserters serving on American merchantmen, but the tensions were resolved with the Jay Treaty of 1794, which opened up 10 years of prosperous trade in exchange for which Britain would remove troops from its fortifications along the Canada–U.S border. The Jeffersonians viewed the Treaty as a surrender to British interests, and mobilized their supporters nationwide to defeat the treaty. The Federalists likewise rallied supporters in a vicious conflict, which continued until 1795 when Washington publicly intervened in the debate, using his prestige to secure ratification. By this point, the economic and political advantages of the Federalist position had become clear to all concerned, combined with growing disdain for France after the Reign of Terror and Jacobin anti-religious policies. Jefferson promptly resigned as Secretary of State. Historian George Herring notes the &quot;remarkable and fortuitous economic and diplomatic gains&quot; produced by the Jay Treaty.

Continuing conflict between Hamilton and Jefferson, especially over foreign policy, led to the formation of the Federalist and Republican parties. Although Washington warned against political parties in his farewell address, he generally supported Hamilton and Hamiltonian programs over those of Jefferson. The Democratic-Republican Party dominated the Upper South, Western frontier, and parts of the middle states. Federalist support was concentrated in the major Northern cities and South Carolina. After Washington&#x27;s death in 1799, he became a symbolic hero of the Federalists.

===Emergence of political parties===
The First Party System between 1792 and 1824 featured two national parties competing for control of the presidency, Congress, and the states: The Federalist Party, which was created by Alexander Hamilton and was dominant to 1800; and the rival Republican Party (Democratic-Republican Party), which was created by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, and was dominant after 1800. Both parties originated in national politics but moved to organize supporters and voters in every state. These comprised &quot;probably the first modern party system in the world&quot; because they were based on voters, not factions of aristocrats at court or parliament. The Federalists appealed to the business community, the Republicans to the planters and farmers. By 1796, politics in every state was nearly monopolized by the two parties.

Jefferson wrote on February 12, 1798:

Two political Sects have arisen within the U. S. the one believing that the executive is the branch of our government which the most needs support; the other that like the analogous branch in the English Government, it is already too strong for the republican parts of the Constitution; and therefore in equivocal cases they incline to the legislative powers: the former of these are called federalists, sometimes aristocrats or monocrats, and sometimes tories, after the corresponding sect in the English Government of exactly the same definition: the latter are stiled republicans, whigs, jacobins, anarchists, disorganizers, etc. these terms are in familiar use with most persons.

The Federalists promoted the financial system of Treasury Secretary Hamilton, which emphasized federal assumption of state debts, a tariff to pay off those debts, a national bank to facilitate financing, and encouragement of banking and manufacturing. The Republicans, based in the plantation South, opposed a strong executive power, were hostile to a standing army and navy, demanded a limited reading of the Constitutional powers of the federal government, and strongly opposed the Hamilton financial program. Perhaps even more important was foreign policy, where the Federalists favored Britain because of its political stability and its close ties to American trade, while the Republicans admired the French and the French Revolution. Jefferson was especially fearful that British influence would undermine republicanism in the United States. Britain and France were at war 1793–1815, with one brief interruption. American policy was neutrality, with the federalists hostile to France, and the Republicans hostile to Britain. The Jay Treaty of 1794 marked the decisive mobilization of the two parties and their supporters in every state. President Washington, while officially nonpartisan, generally supported the Federalists and that party made Washington their iconic hero.

===Adams administration: 1797–1801===


Washington retired in 1797, firmly declining to serve for more than eight years as the nation&#x27;s head. The Federalists campaigned for Vice President John Adams to be elected president. Adams defeated Jefferson in the 1796 presidential election, who as the runner-up became vice president under the operation of the Electoral College of that time.

Even before he entered the presidency, Adams had quarreled with Alexander Hamilton, a conflict that was hindered by a divided Federalist party.

These domestic difficulties were compounded by international complications: France, angered by American approval in 1795 of the Jay Treaty with its great enemy Britain proclaimed that food and war material bound for British ports were subject to seizure by the French navy. By 1797, France had seized 300 American ships and had broken off diplomatic relations with the United States. When Adams sent three other commissioners to Paris to negotiate, agents of Foreign Minister Charles Maurice de Talleyrand (whom Adams labeled &quot;X, Y and Z&quot; in his report to Congress) informed the Americans that negotiations could only begin if the United States loaned France $12 million and bribed officials of the French government. American hostility to France rose to an excited pitch, fanned by French ambassador Edmond-Charles Genêt. Federalists used the &quot;XYZ Affair&quot; to create a new American army, strengthen the fledgling United States Navy, impose the Alien and Sedition Acts to stop pro-French activities (which had severe repercussions for American civil liberties), and enact new taxes to pay for it. The Naturalization Act, which changed the residency requirement for citizenship from five to 14 years, was targeted at Irish and French immigrants suspected of supporting the Republican Party. The Sedition Act proscribed writing, speaking or publishing anything of &quot;a false, scandalous and malicious&quot; nature against the president or Congress. The few convictions won under the Sedition Act only created martyrs to the cause of civil liberties and aroused support for the Republicans. Jefferson and his allies launched a counterattack, with two states stating in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions that state legislatures could nullify acts of Congress. However, all the other states rejected this proposition, and nullification—or as it was called, the &quot;principle of 98&quot;—became the preserve of a faction of the Republicans called the Quids.

In 1799, after a series of naval battles with the French (known as the &quot;Quasi-War&quot;), full-scale war seemed inevitable. In this crisis, Adams broke with his party and sent three new commissioners to France. Napoleon, who had just come to power, received them cordially, and the danger of conflict subsided with the negotiation of the Convention of 1800, which formally released the United States from its 1778 wartime alliance with France. However, reflecting American weakness, France refused to pay $20 million for American ships seized by the French navy.

In his final hours in office, Adams appointed John Marshall as chief justice. Serving until his death in 1835, Marshall dramatically expanded the powers of the Supreme Court and provided a Federalist interpretation of the Constitution that made for a strong national government.

==Jeffersonian Era==


Thomas Jefferson is a central figure in early American history, highly praised for his political leadership but also criticized for the role of slavery in his private life. He championed equality, democracy and republicanism, attacking aristocratic and monarchistic tendencies. He led and inspired the American Revolution, advocated freedom of religion and tolerance, and opposed the centralizing tendencies of the urban financial elite. Jefferson formed the second national political party and led it to dominance in 1800, then worked for western expansion and exploration. Critics decry the contradiction between his ownership of hundreds of slaves and his famous declaration that &quot;all men are created equal&quot;, and argue that he fathered children with his slave mistress.

Under Washington and Adams, the Federalists had established a strong government, but sometimes it followed policies that alienated the citizenry. In 1798, in order to pay for the rapidly expanding army and navy, the Federalists had enacted a new tax on houses, land and slaves, affecting every property owner in the country. In the Fries&#x27;s Rebellion hundreds of farmers in Pennsylvania revolted—Federalists saw a breakdown in civil society. Some tax resisters were arrested—then pardoned by Adams. Republicans denounced this action as an example of Federalist tyranny.

Jefferson had steadily gathered behind him a great mass of small farmers, shopkeepers and other workers which asserted themselves as Democratic-Republicans in the election of 1800. Jefferson enjoyed extraordinary favor because of his appeal to American idealism. Jefferson&#x27;s first inaugural address on March 4, 1801, was the first such speech in the new capital of Washington, D.C.. In it, Jefferson promised &quot;a wise and frugal government&quot; to preserve order among the inhabitants but would &quot;leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry, and improvement&quot;.

Jefferson encouraged agriculture and westward expansion, most notably by the Louisiana Purchase and subsequent Lewis and Clark Expedition. Believing America to be a haven for the oppressed, Jefferson reduced the residency requirement for naturalization to five years.

By the end of his second term, Jefferson and Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin had managed to reduce the national debt to less than $56 million by reducing the number of executive department employees and Army and Navy officers and enlisted men, and otherwise curtailing government and military spending.

Jefferson&#x27;s domestic policy was uneventful and hands-off; the Jefferson administration concerned itself predominantly with foreign affairs and territorial expansion. Except for Gallatin&#x27;s reforms, their main preoccupation was purging the government of Federalist judges. Jefferson and his associates were widely distrustful of the judicial branch, especially because Adams had made several &quot;midnight&quot; appointments before leaving office in March 1801. In &quot;Marbury vs Madison&quot; (1803), the Supreme Court under John Marshall established the precedent of reviewing and overturning legislation passed by Congress. This ruling by leading Federalists upset Jefferson to the point where his administration began opening impeachment hearings against judges perceived as abusing their power. The attempted purge of the judicial branch reached its climax with the trial of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase. When Chase was acquitted by the Senate, Jefferson abandoned his campaign.

With the upcoming expiration in 1807 of the 20-year ban on Congressional action on the subject, Jefferson, a lifelong opponent of the slave trade, successfully called on Congress to criminalize the international slave trade, calling it &quot;violations of human rights which have been so long continued on the unoffending inhabitants of Africa, and which the morality, the reputation, and the best interests of our country have long been eager to proscribe.&quot;

===Jeffersonian principles of foreign policy===
The Jeffersonians had a distinct foreign policy:

* Americans had a duty to spread what Jefferson called the &quot;Empire of Liberty&quot; to the world, but should avoid &quot;entangling alliances&quot;.
* Britain was the greatest threat, especially its monarchy, aristocracy, corruption, and business methods&quot;—&quot;the Jay Treaty of 1794 was much too favorable to Britain and thus threatened American values.
* Regarding the French Revolution, its devotion to principles of Republicanism, liberty, equality, and fraternity made France the ideal European nation. &quot;Jefferson&#x27;s support of the French Revolution often serves in his mind as a defense of republicanism against the monarchism of the Anglophiles&quot;. On the other hand, Napoleon was the antithesis of republicanism and could not be supported.
* Navigation rights on the Mississippi River were critical to American national interests. Control by Spain was tolerable&quot;—&quot;control by France was unacceptable. The Louisiana Purchase was an unexpected opportunity to guarantee those rights which the Jeffersonians immediately seized upon.
* Most Jeffersonians argued an expensive high seas Navy was unnecessary, since cheap locally based gunboats, floating batteries, mobile shore batteries, and coastal fortifications could defend the ports without the temptation to engage in distant wars. Jefferson himself, however, wanted a few frigates to protect American shipping against Barbary pirates in the Mediterranean.
**To protect its shipping interests from pirates in the Mediterranean, Jefferson and Madison fought the First Barbary War in 1801–1805 and the Second Barbary War in 1815.
* A standing army is dangerous to liberty and should be avoided. Instead of threatening warfare, Jeffersonians relied on economic coercion such as the embargo. See Embargo Act of 1807.
* The locally controlled non-professional militia was adequate to defend the nation from invasion. After the militia proved inadequate in the first year of the War of 1812 President Madison expanded the national Army for the duration.

===Louisiana Purchase===
The Louisiana Purchase in 1803 gave Western farmers use of the important Mississippi River waterway, removed the French presence from the western border of the United States, and, most important, provided U.S. settlers with vast potential for expansion. A few weeks afterward, war resumed between Britain and Napoleon&#x27;s France. The United States, dependent on European revenues from the export of agricultural goods, tried to export food and raw materials to both warring Great Powers and to profit from transporting goods between their home markets and Caribbean colonies. Both sides permitted this trade when it benefited them but opposed it when it did not. Following the 1805 destruction of the French navy at the Battle of Trafalgar, Britain sought to impose a stranglehold over French overseas trade ties. Thus, in retaliation against U.S. trade practices, Britain imposed a loose blockade of the American coast. Believing that Britain could not rely on other sources of food than the United States, Congress and President Jefferson suspended all U.S. trade with foreign nations in the Embargo Act of 1807, hoping to get the British to end their blockade of the American coast. The Embargo Act, however, devastated American agricultural exports and weakened American ports while Britain found other sources of food.

===War of 1812===

James Madison won the U.S. presidential election of 1808, largely on the strength of his abilities in foreign affairs at a time when Britain and France were both on the brink of war with the United States. He was quick to repeal the Embargo Act, refreshing American seaports. Despite his intellectual brilliance, Madison lacked Jefferson&#x27;s leadership and tried to merely copy his predecessor&#x27;s policies verbatim. He tried various trade restrictions to try to force Britain and France to end their interference with American shipping, but they were unsuccessful. The Royal Navy enjoyed undisputed mastery over the sea after defeating the French and Spanish fleet at Trafalgar in 1805, but needed large numbers of sailors, and was deeply angered at the American merchant fleet for being a haven for British deserters. At the same time, the size of the U.S. Navy was reduced due to ideological opposition to a large standing military and the Federal government became considerably weakened when the charter of the First National Bank expired and Congress declined to renew it. A clamor for military action thus erupted just as relations with Britain and France were at a low point and the U.S.&#x27;s ability to wage war had been reduced.

In response to continued British interference with American shipping (including the Royal Navy&#x27;s practice of impressing alleged deserters from US merchantmen), and to British aid to American Indians in the Old Northwest, the Twelfth Congress—led by Southern and Western Jeffersonians—declared war on Britain in 1812. Westerners and Southerners were the most ardent supporters of the war, given their concerns about defending national honor and expanding western settlements, and having access to world markets for their agricultural exports. New England was making a fine profit and its Federalists opposed the war, almost to the point of secession. The Federalist reputation collapsed in the triumphalism of 1815 and the party no longer played a national role.

The war drew to a close after bitter fighting that lasted even after the British burning of Washington in August 1814 and Andrew Jackson&#x27;s victory over an invading British army at the Battle of New Orleans in January 1815. The ratification of the Treaty of Ghent in February 1815, formally ended the war, returned to the &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot;. Britain&#x27;s alliance with the Native Americans ended, and the Indians were the major losers of the war. News of the American victory at New Orleans came at the same time as news of the peace, giving Americans a psychological triumph and opening the Era of Good Feelings. Recovery from the destruction left in the wake of the war began, including rebuilding the Library of Congress collection which had been destroyed in the Burning of Washington. The war destroyed the anti-war Federalist Party and opened the door for generals like Andrew Jackson and William Henry Harrison, and civilian leaders like James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, and Henry Clay, to run for national office.

==Social history==

===Second Great Awakening===

The Second Great Awakening was a Protestant religious revival movement that flourished in 1800–1840 in every region.

===Women===
Zagarri (2007) argues the Revolution created an ongoing debate on the rights of women and created an environment favorable to women&#x27;s participation in politics. She asserts that for a brief decades, a &quot;comprehensive transformation in women&#x27;s rights, roles, and responsibilities seemed not only possible but perhaps inevitable.&quot; However the opening of possibilities also engendered a backlash that actually set back the cause of women&#x27;s rights and led to a greater rigidity that marginalized women from political life.

Judith Sargent Murray published the early and influential essay &quot;On the Equality of the Sexes&quot; in 1790, blaming poor standards in female education as the root of women&#x27;s problems. However, scandals surrounding the personal lives of English contemporaries Catharine Macaulay and Mary Wollstonecraft pushed feminist authorship into private correspondence from the 1790s through the early decades of the nineteenth century.

<text>Güssing (; , ) is a town in Burgenland, Austria. It is located at , with a population of 3,610 (2023), and is the administrative center of the Güssing district. For centuries the town occupied an important position on the western edge of the Kingdom of Hungary. The town is now most famous for its castle, which is the oldest in Burgenland and a prominent regional landmark, built on an extinct volcano. 
==History==
===Overview===
The origins of Güssing date back to 1157, with the construction of the castle alongside a small settlement nearby. By 1355, Güssing had been granted special rights by Louis IV. During the Middle Ages, religion, art and crafts were of great importance. As a border town, Güssing was fortified in order to repel attacks from what is now Hungary. Despite the threat of invasion Güssing prospered, with residents of the town at the time including the Artois botanist Carolus Clusius, and Johann Manlius, a typographer.
There is an homage to Clusius in the town, as well as a street named after him, the &quot;Clusiusweg&quot;.

In the 16th century, Güssing was a free imperial city with full municipal laws. In 1619, the town was surrounded with an enceinte, a type of town wall. The town at the time contained four quarters- &quot;Vorstadt&quot;, &quot;untere Stadt&quot; by the mansion of the Drašković family, &quot;innere Stadt&quot; from the monastery to the town hall and &quot;Hochstadt&quot;.

The lords of Güssing (in Hungarian: &quot;Kőszeg&quot;, in Slovak: &quot;Kysak&quot;) were a noble family in the frontier region of Austria and the Kingdom of Hungary. Note that Kőszeg is the name of a nearby Hungarian town (known as &quot;Güns&quot; in German) to which that family moved its residence from Güssing in 1274.
In 1522, it became the residence of the Batthyány family, one of the most distinguished magnate families in Hungary. The family still Batthyány own the ancestral seat of Güssing Castle. In 1540, Franz Batthyány gained the magnate from Ferdinand I, the incumbent king of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia, which allowed him to open up ore mines, whilst in 1549, he was granted the right to hold markets in the town by the emperor. A market still takes place on the first Monday of every month in the town.

The area, like the rest of what is now Burgenland, belonged to Hungary until 1921. From 1898, the town had to use the Hungarian place name &quot;Németújvár&quot; due to the Magyarization policies of the government in Budapest. After the end of the First World War, the town, as part of &quot;German West Hungary&quot; (Deutsch Westungarn), was ceded to Austria after tough negotiations in the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and the Treaty of Trianon in 1919. The area has been part of the newly formed state of Burgenland since 1921. In 1973 the area was officially declared a town.

In the 20th century, Güssing struggled economically due to its proximity to the Hungarian border, and with it the Iron Curtain during the Cold War. Many residents moved elsewhere or commuted for long distances to find work.

==Geography==

The town is situated in the south of Burgenland, close to the Hungarian border, in the valley of the river Strem at a height of 229 metres above sea level. Just under half of the area is agricultural land, whilst nearly 40% is forested. The town is neighboured by Tobaj to the north, Strem to the east, Heiligenbrunn to the southeast, Kleinmürbisch and Großmürbisch to the south, Neustift bei Güssing to the southwest and Gerersdorf-Sulz to the northwest.
The Güssing fish ponds are a designated Ramsar site within the town, known for its bird populations of little bittern, grey heron and great crested grebe.

=== Renewable energy ===
The town is also known for its renewable energy projects. During the 1980s, Peter Vadasz, a local councillor, and Reinhard Koch, a technical engineer, created an energy transition strategy for the town by using local wood as an energy source. In 1992, Vadasz was elected mayor of Güssing and worked towards this energy transition. This transition was not only devised for public buildings in the town, but for the whole district as well. In order to achieve this goal, public buildings were insulated and biomass heat plants were built. More recently, an anaerobic digestion plant was built. Local authorities have claimed this has led to full energy self-sufficiency in the district, yet this is disputed by others, who claim that transportation of goods and fuel still relies upon fossil fuels. Energy in Güssing is heavily reliant on wood, which has led to concerns about energy security.

==International Relations==
Güssing is twinned with:
* Nijlen, 
===Neighbourhoods===

The neighbourhoods that make up the town area include (with the population as of January 2021 in brackets):

* Glasing (123) with the Glasing mountains

* Krottendorf (212)
* Sankt Nikolaus (193)

==Culture==

*The main attraction of the district is Güssing castle. Built on a volcanic cone, the castle is known for its exhibition &quot;400 years of art&quot;, the gothic castle chapel (with a neo-Gothic, wooden carved high altar, an old chest organ and a baroque side altar. The castle also contains a museum and a restaurant.
* A romanesque parish church dates back to the 1200s, with a cemetery nearby.
*The town contains a Franciscan monastery, which was built at the same time as a bastion of the town wall and a monastic church, the Visitation of Mary church. Built in 1863, the monastery contains a range of renaissance architectural elements. The monastery is also noted for a paramental shrine in the sacristy and the library with many unique works from the age of Protestantism. Under the monastery is the crypt of the family Batthyány, which is the second largest of its kind in Austria, with a state coffin by K. Moll. There is also a shrine depicting the beatification of László Batthyány-Strattmann.
* There is a two-storey, castle like arcade in the town.
* In the east of the town is the family home of the Drašković family. This is a classicist style mansion with empire style furniture and a gothic winged altar from 1450 in the house chapel.

===Regular events===
*Musical Güssing: The cultural association hosts several events each year. In late January a carnival show takes place in the heart of Güssing. Every September a well-known musical show is performed, in which amateurs and professionals work together. The actor and singer Florian Resetarits (de) began his career in these musicals.
*Castle performances: For the last 500 years, Güssing has been a cultural centre, with the theatre being of particular significance. The castle performances are a highlight of the summer programme. The actor Frank Hoffmann was the most recent director of the Güssing summer programme, as part of which performances take place at Güssing castle. The Güssing castle association hosts theatre performances for adults and children on the fairground at the foot of the castle.

<text>The South Fork of the Grand River is a tributary of the Grand River, approximately 90 mi (145 km) long, in South Dakota in the United States.

It rises in the Badlands of northwestern South Dakota, south of the Cave Hills in western Harding County, and flows east past Buffalo, then past several units of the Grand River National Grassland in northern Perkins County. It joins the North Fork in the Shadehill Reservoir near to form the Grand, which is a tributary of the Missouri.

<doc id="539686" wikidata="Q6229525" url="?curid=539686" title="John Dixwell">
<text>John Dixwell, alias James Davids ( 160718 March 1689), was an English lawyer, republican politician and regicide. Born in Warwickshire, during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms he held various administrative positions in Kent on behalf of Parliament, and approved the Execution of Charles I in January 1649. Under the Commonwealth, he served as Governor of Dover Castle, and was a member of the English Council of State.

Aware that he faced likely prosecution as a regicide, Dixwell fled to Germany shortly before the May 1660 Stuart Restoration, and was condemned to death by Parliament. He later made his way to New Haven, Connecticut, where he lived quietly under the name of James Davids, untroubled by the authorities, who thought him dead. He died in 1689.

==Personal details==
John Dixwell was born 1607, younger son of Edward Dixwell (1575–1617), and his wife Mary Hawksworth (1580–1627). He had an elder brother Mark (?–1644), who was killed serving under the Parliamentarian general William Waller.

After moving to New England, in November 1673 he married Joanna Ling, who died shortly afterwards. Bathsheba Howe (1648–1729) became his second wife in 1677, and they had three children; Mary (1679–1727), John (1681–1725), and Elizabeth (died young).

==First and Second English Civil Wars==
After their father died in 1617, Dixwell and his brother seem to have been raised by their childless and wealthy relative, Sir Basil Dixwell (1585–1642), a former High Sheriff of Kent who lived near Folkestone. In the late 1630s, he moved to Broome Park, which was inherited by Mark Dixwell when Sir Basil died in 1642. John Dixwell began legal training at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1631, and qualified as a lawyer in 1638.

When the First English Civil War began in August 1642, Kent was quickly secured for Parliament, although there were significant pockets of Royalist support. In July 1643, the Royalists assembled some 4,000 men at Sevenoaks, which had to be suppressed by Parliamentarian troops led by Richard Browne. Its proximity to London and key ports like Dover, Deal and Sandwich meant control of the county was an important strategic objective for both sides.

John Dixwell played a prominent role in the local Parliamentary administration, serving on the County Committee which collected taxes and controlled the courts. His older brother Mark was a colonel in the Kent Trained Bands until his death in early 1644, when John was appointed guardian of his children and took up residence in Broome Park. He succeeded Mark as colonel of the local militia, and in August 1646 was elected MP for Dover in the Long Parliament, replacing Sir Edward Boys.

The First Civil War ended when Charles I surrendered in June 1646, but victory was succeeded by a series of disputes over the post-war political settlement between the New Model Army and the majority of MPs. In this contest, Dixwell appears to have sympathised with the army and religious Independents in Parliament. In December 1647, protests in Canterbury against alterations to the Book of Common Prayer escalated into a pro-Royalist revolt, which was eventually put down by the County Committee.

When the Second English Civil War began in early 1648, Kentish Royalists occupied towns including Maidstone and Dover. By August, the rising had been suppressed, but many Independents like Dixwell now believed only the removal of Charles I would end the fighting. In December 1648, Pride&#x27;s Purge excluded all MPs who opposed putting him on trial, and Dixwell was one of those who retained their seats in what became known as the &quot;Rump Parliament&quot;. He sat on the court set up for the trial, and approved the Execution of Charles I in January 1649.

==The Interregnum==
Dixwell was made a member of the English Council of State in November 1651, then confirmed as Governor of Dover Castle in January 1652. However, his closest political allies were republicans like Edmund Ludlow and Henry Vane, who opposed Cromwell&#x27;s dissolution of the Rump Parliament in April 1653, and establishment of The Protectorate. Unlike Ludlow, Dixwell did not openly oppose the regime, and was elected MP for Kent in 1654 and 1656, then for Dover once again in 1659.

However, in the political crisis that followed the death of Oliver Cromwell in September 1658, and the resignation of his successor Richard Cromwell in April 1659, Dixwell sided with those who wanted to re-assert civilian control over the army, and restore the Commonwealth. When the Rump Parliament was re-installed in May 1659, he resumed his seat as MP for Dover, was confirmed as Governor of Dover Castle, and appointed to the Council of State. Along with Vane and Oliver St John, he was one of three councillors who refused to swear an oath of allegiance to the Protectorate.

By spring 1660, it was clear efforts to maintain the Commonwealth had failed, and a Stuart Restoration was imminent. In May, Charles II issued the Declaration of Breda, which offered a general pardon for all &quot;crimes&quot; committed since 1640, with the notable exception of the regicides. In June, Dixwell was one of ten regicides whose lives were guaranteed in return for their surrender, but decided not to rely upon this commitment. To protect his estates from confiscation, he sold part of Broome Park to his Royalist neighbour Sir Thomas Peyton, while his nephew Basill Dixwell married one of Peyton&#x27;s daughters. After requesting a delay due to illness, he escaped into exile, and on 11 June 1660, Parliament passed an Act of Attainder, which condemned twenty-three regicides to death, including Dixwell.

==Exile, later life, and death==


Along with other exiles, Dixwell initially settled in the German town of Hanau, a well-known refuge for political and religious dissidents. With Royalist agents actively seeking to kidnap or assassinate those regicides still at large, several decided Hanau was too exposed. At some point, Dixwell moved to Switzerland, before sailing for New England in early 1665. He spent the next two years in Hadley, Massachusetts, where he briefly shared lodgings with two other regicides, William Goffe and Edward Whalley.

Unlike his two companions, who were known to be in New England, no warrants were issued for Dixwell, since the authorities had been unable to trace him and assumed he had died. He settled in New Haven, Connecticut in 1670, using the name &quot;James Davids&quot; and pretending to be a retired merchant. He remained committed to his republican views, writing ‘the Lord will appear for his people...and there will be those in power again who will relieve the injured and oppressed’. Although some of his neighbours suspected Dixwell was a fugitive, he lived quietly with his wife and children, and only revealed his true name just before he died on 18 March 1689.

==Legacy==
Dixwell was laid to rest in the Old Burying Ground behind the Center Church on New Haven Green. The original monument is still visible, with a larger one added later. Various towns in New England have streets commemorating Dixwell, Whalley and Goffe, including Hadley and New Haven.

<text>Oberpullendorf (; or ; ) is a town in Burgenland, Austria. It is the administrative center of the district of Oberpullendorf.

== Geography ==
Oberpullendorf is a municipality in the middle of the Burgenland. It consists of two united communities: Mitterpullendorf and Oberpullendorf, and is also the capital of the same called administrative district of Oberpullendorf.

It is surrounded by the communities of Stoob to the north, Großwarasdorf to the east, Frankenau-Unterpullendorf to the south, and Steinberg-Dörfl to the west.

The Stooberbach crosses the municipality from north-west to the south-east.

== History ==
The district of Oberpullendorf has been populated since the Neolithic age. During the early Iron Age the district was a flourishing iron industrial area.

Josef Polatschek, a gardener and regional researcher, mapped several ancient iron extraction sites in the district.

Oberpullendorf was firstly documented in 1225 as a Hungarian frontier guard settlement.

Traditionally Oberpullendorf was the seat of several noble families, among them the Counts Cseszneky de Milvány and the Barons Rohonczy de Felsőpulya.

In 1853 Oberpullendorf became the location of a Hungarian revenue authority.

After the demise of the Austrian-Hungarian monarchy in 1918, the German-speaking inhabitants of Deutsch-Westungarn (&quot;German Western Hungary&quot;, later Burgenland) - Oberpullendorf being part of it - intended to join the &quot;new&quot; state of Austria. Back then, Oberpullendorf was part of Sopron County, Hungary.
The decision about Deutsch-Westungarn was fixed in the peace treaties of Saint Germain and Trianon. Despite diplomatic efforts by Hungary, the victorious parties of World War I set the date of Burgenland&#x27;s official unification with Austria as August 28, 1921.
(Also see: Burgenland)

In 1958 the two communities of Ober- and Mitterpullendorf were consolidated and since 1975 Oberpullendorf is a municipality.

== Coat of arms ==
On a red shield a golden city wall with an open portcullis can be seen. Above that, a golden lion facing to the right is holding a golden sword and in the background a golden ploughshare is situated, which is accompanied by two golden ears of corn.

== Politics ==
Johann Heisz, a member of the Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP), is the mayor of the town.

The parish council consists of 23 mandates - of which the ÖVP (Austrian People&#x27;s Party) is holding 13 mandates and the SPÖ (Social Democratic Party) has 10 mandates. (2022)

== Culture and sights ==
• Haus St. Stephan - the former castle of the &quot;Rohonczy&quot; family

<text>Neusiedl am See (; ; ; ; ) is a town in Burgenland, Austria, and administrative center of the district of Neusiedl am See.

Neusiedl am See is located on the northern shore of Lake Neusiedl.

== History ==
The first mention of &quot;Sumbotheil&quot; (referring to its right to hold Saturday markets) dates back to 1209. In the mid-13th century, the town was destroyed by the Mongols, and by 1282 under the name &quot;Niusidel&quot; resettled. In 1517 Neusiedl received market rights. Neusiedl in 1683 was in the wake of the second Turkish siege, and in 1708 the town was devastated by the Kuruc. Neusiedl am See received a city charter in 1926, which had already been investigated in 1824.

Like the rest of Burgenland, it was part of the Kingdom of Hungary until 1920/21. After the end of World War I it was given to Austria in the Treaty of St. Germain and Trianon. It has belonged since 1921 to the new State of Burgenland (see also history of Burgenland). 

The town is known as the birthplace of the experimental guitarist and composer, Christian Fennesz, also known for his swirling, spatial works and collaboration with Japanese pianist Ryuichi Sakamoto.

<doc id="539700" wikidata="Q1521636" url="?curid=539700" title="Elizabethan Religious Settlement">
<text>The Elizabethan Religious Settlement is the name given to the religious and political arrangements made for England during the reign of Elizabeth I (1558–1603). The settlement, implemented from 1559 to 1563, marked the end of the English Reformation. It permanently shaped the Church of England&#x27;s doctrine and liturgy, laying the foundation for the unique identity of Anglicanism.

When Elizabeth inherited the throne, England was bitterly divided between Catholics and Protestants as a result of various religious changes initiated by Henry VIII, Edward VI and Mary I. Henry VIII had broken from the Catholic Church and the authority of the Pope, becoming the supreme head of the Church of England. During Edward&#x27;s reign, the Church of England adopted a Reformed theology and liturgy. In Mary&#x27;s reign, these religious policies were reversed, England was re-united with the Catholic Church and Protestantism was suppressed.

The Elizabethan Settlement was an attempt to end this religious turmoil. The Act of Supremacy of 1558 re-established the Church of England&#x27;s independence from Rome. Parliament conferred on Elizabeth the title of Supreme Governor of the Church of England. The Act of Uniformity 1558 re-introduced the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, which contained the liturgical services of the church. Some modifications were made to appeal to Catholics and Lutherans, including giving individuals greater latitude concerning belief in the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist and permission to use traditional priestly vestments. In 1571, the Convocations of Canterbury and York adopted the Thirty-Nine Articles as a confessional statement for the church, and a &quot;Book of Homilies&quot; was issued outlining the church&#x27;s reformed theology in greater detail. 

The settlement failed to end religious disputes. While most people conformed, a minority of recusants remained loyal Catholics. Within the Church of England, a Calvinist consensus developed among leading churchmen. Calvinists split between conformists and Puritans, who wanted to abolish what they considered papist abuses and replace episcopacy with a presbyterian church government. After Elizabeth&#x27;s death, a high church, Arminian party gained power in the reign of Charles I and challenged the Puritans.

The English Civil War (1642–1651) and the overthrow of the monarchy allowed the Puritans to pursue their reform agenda, including dismantling the Elizabethan Settlement. The Restoration in 1660 reestablished both the monarchy and the religious settlement, but the Puritans were forced out of the Church of England. Anglicans now defined their church as a &quot;via media&quot; or middle way between the religious extremes of Catholicism and Protestantism; Arminianism and Calvinism; and high church and low church.

==Background==

Elizabeth I inherited a kingdom bitterly divided over matters of religion. This division began during the reign of her father, Henry VIII. After his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, failed to produce a male heir, Henry applied to the pope for an annulment of his marriage. When his request was denied, Henry separated the Church of England from the Catholic Church and claimed that he, rather than the pope, was its supreme head on earth. Under Elizabeth&#x27;s half-brother, Edward VI, the Church of England became more explicitly Protestant, projecting a &quot;restrained&quot; Calvinism, in the words of historian Christopher Haigh.

During Edward&#x27;s reign, the Church of England preached justification by faith alone as a central teaching, in contrast to the Catholic teaching that the contrite person could cooperate with God towards their salvation by performing good works. The doctrines of purgatory, prayer for the dead and the intercession of saints were also rejected during this time. The Mass, the central act of Catholic worship, was condemned as idolatry and replaced with a Protestant communion service, a reminder of Christ&#x27;s crucifixion. Christ&#x27;s Real Presence in the Eucharist was no longer explained by the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation; instead, the 1552 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; promoted the Reformed teaching of Christ&#x27;s spiritual presence. The veneration of religious images (icons, roods, statues) and relics were suppressed, and iconoclasm was sanctioned by the government.

Mary I, Elizabeth&#x27;s half-sister, became queen in 1553. She reversed the religious innovations introduced by her father and brother. Under Mary&#x27;s rule, England returned to the Catholic Church and recognised the pope&#x27;s authority. Mary died in November 1558 without a Catholic heir, leaving the throne to the Protestant Elizabeth.

== Elizabeth&#x27;s accession ==
Elizabeth&#x27;s religious views were Protestant, though &quot;peculiarly conservative&quot;. She also kept many of her religious views private, which can make it difficult to determine what she believed. She disliked married clergy, held Lutheran views on Eucharistic presence, and there is evidence she preferred the more ceremonial 1549 prayer book.

The Queen&#x27;s principal secretary was Sir William Cecil, a moderate Protestant. Her Privy Council was filled with former Edwardian politicians, and only Protestants preached at Court.

To avoid alarming foreign Catholic observers, Elizabeth initially maintained that nothing in religion had changed. A proclamation forbade any &quot;breach, alteration, or change of any order or usage presently established within this our realm&quot;. Nevertheless, Protestants were emboldened to practice illegal forms of worship, and a proclamation on 27 December prohibited all forms other than the Latin Mass and the English Litany. It was obvious to most that these were temporary measures. Her government&#x27;s goal was to resurrect the Edwardian reforms, reinstating the Royal Injunctions of 1547, the 1552 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, and the Forty-two Articles of Religion of 1553.

Elizabeth gave her first indication of changes to come at Mass on Christmas Day 1558. Prior to the service, she instructed the celebrant, Owen Oglethorpe, bishop of Carlisle, not to elevate the host. He refused, so the Queen left the chapel before the consecration. In effect, Elizabeth was declaring that she did not believe in the doctrine of transubstantiation.

Elizabeth&#x27;s coronation took place on 15 January 1559 at Westminster Abbey, and there was no elevation during the coronation Mass. The Queen returned to Westminster Abbey on 25 January for the state opening of Parliament. She was greeted by Abbot Feckenham and the other monks bearing candles in procession. Signaling her disapproval of what she considered Catholic superstition, Elizabeth told the monks, &quot;Away with those torches, for we see very well&quot;.

==Legislation==
===Reformation bill===
When the Queen&#x27;s first Parliament opened in January 1559, its chief goal was the difficult task of reaching a religious settlement. Twenty bishops (all Catholics) sat in the House of Lords as Lords Spiritual, and the Lords in general were opposed to change. In February, the House of Commons passed a Reformation Bill that would restore royal supremacy, the Edwardine Ordinal, and a slightly revised 1552 prayer book. It was not popular with the clergy, and the Convocation of Canterbury reacted by affirming papal supremacy, transubstantiation and the Mass as a sacrificial offering.

The lay peers joined the bishops in their opposition and succeeded in amending the bill considerably. The ordinal and prayer book provisions were removed and the Mass left unchanged, with the exception of allowing communion under both kinds. The pope&#x27;s authority was removed, but rather than granting the Queen the title of supreme head of the church, it merely said she could adopt it herself. This bill would have returned the Church to its position at the death of Henry VIII rather than to that when Edward VI died. It was a defeat for the Queen&#x27;s legislative programme, so she withheld royal assent.

===Act of Supremacy===
Following the Queen&#x27;s failure to grant approval to the previous bill, Parliament reconvened in April 1559. At this point, the Privy Council introduced two new bills, one concerning royal supremacy and the other about a Protestant liturgy. The Council hoped that by separating them at least the Supremacy bill would pass. Under this bill, the Pope&#x27;s jurisdiction in England was once again abolished, and Elizabeth was to be supreme governor of the Church of England instead of supreme head. All clergy and royal office-holders would be required to swear an Oath of Supremacy.

The alternative title was less offensive to Catholic members of Parliament, but this was unlikely to have been the only reason for the alteration. It was also a concession to the Queen&#x27;s Protestant supporters who objected to &quot;supreme head&quot; on theological grounds and who had concerns about a female leading the Church. John Calvin, an influential Continental reformer, had called Henry VIII&#x27;s claim to supreme headship blasphemy. Thomas Sampson, a Marian exile, believed that &quot;All scripture seems to assign the title of head of the Church to Christ alone&quot;.

The bill included permission to receive communion in two kinds. It also repealed the medieval heresy laws that Mary I had revived. Catholics gained an important concession. Under the bill, only opinions contrary to Scripture, the General Councils of the early church, and any future Parliament could be treated as heresy by the Crown&#x27;s ecclesiastical commissioners. While broad and ambiguous, this provision was meant to reassure Catholics that they would have some protection.

The bill easily passed the House of Commons. In the House of Lords, all the bishops voted against it, but they were joined by only one lay peer. The Act of Supremacy became law.

=== Act of Uniformity and prayer book ===

Another bill introduced to the same Parliament with the intent to return Protestant practices to legal dominance was the Uniformity bill, which sought to restore the 1552 prayer book as the official liturgy. It encountered more opposition in the Lords than the Supremacy Act, passing by only three votes. Even this was possible only through political intrigue. Bishops Watson of Lincoln and White of Winchester were imprisoned in the Tower. Bishop Goldwell of St Asaph was never summoned to Parliament, and the elderly Bishop Tunstall of Durham was excused from attending on account of age.

The Act of Uniformity required church attendance on Sundays and holy days and imposed fines for each day absent. It authorized the 1559 prayer book, which effectively restored the 1552 prayer book with some modifications. The Litany in the 1552 book had denounced &quot;the bishop of Rome, and all his detestable enormities&quot;. The revised &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; removed this denunciation of the Pope. It also deleted the Black Rubric, which in the 1552 book explained that kneeling for communion did not imply Eucharistic adoration.

The Ornaments Rubric was added as one of the concessions to traditionalists in order to gain passage in the Lords. The rubric provided instructions for clerical vestments, stating that until the Queen ordered otherwise ministers were to &quot;use such ornaments as were in use by the authority of Parliament in the second year of the reign of King Edward VI&quot;. Edward&#x27;s second regnal year ran from 28 January 1548 to 27 January 1549. During this time, priests said Mass in Latin wearing traditional Catholic vestments. Few thought this was the rubric&#x27;s meaning, however. Since the Act of Uniformity 1549 which approved the first prayer book was passed in January, it is likely that the provisions of the 1549 prayer book were intended, even though Edward&#x27;s second year ended several months before the book was published. The 1549 prayer book required clergy to wear the alb, cope and chasuble. Opposition to the so-called &quot;popish wardrobe&quot; made it impossible to enforce the rubric.

The most significant revision was a change to the Communion Service that added the words for administering sacramental bread and wine from the 1549 prayer book to the words in the 1552 book. When communicants received the bread, they would hear the words, &quot;The body of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was given for thee, preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting life [1549]. Take and eat this in remembrance that Christ died for thee, and feed on him in thy heart by faith with thanksgiving&quot; [1552]. This combination could be interpreted as an affirmation of an objective real presence to those who believed in it, while others could interpret it to mean memorialism.

===Scholarly interpretation===

In his &quot;Puritan Choir&quot; thesis, historian J. E. Neale argues that Elizabeth wanted to pursue a conservative policy but was pushed in a radical direction by a Protestant faction in the House of Commons. This theory has been challenged by Christopher Haigh, who argues that Elizabeth wanted radical reform but was pushed in a conservative direction by the House of Lords. Haigh argues that the Act of Uniformity &quot;produced an ambiguous Book of Common Prayer: a liturgical compromise which allowed priests to perform the Church of England communion with Catholic regalia, standing in the Catholic position, and using words capable of Catholic interpretation&quot;. This made it easier for priests to &quot;counterfeit&quot; the Mass without risking arrest.

Another historian, Diarmaid MacCulloch, also finds Neale&#x27;s thesis flawed. At the same time, he calls the idea that the prayer book modifications were concessions to Catholics &quot;absurd&quot;, writing that &quot;these little verbal and visual adjustments&quot; would never satisfy Catholic clergy and laity after the loss of &quot;the Latin mass, monasteries, chantries, shrines, gilds and a compulsory celibate priesthood&quot;. He argues the modifications were most likely meant to appease domestic and foreign Lutheran Protestants who opposed the memorialist view originating from reformed Zurich. In 1559, Elizabeth was still unsure of the theological orientation of her Protestant subjects, and she did not want to offend the Lutheran rulers of northern Europe by veering too far into the Reformed camp. &quot;It was worthwhile for Elizabeth&#x27;s government to throw the Lutherans a few theological scraps, and the change also chimed with the Queen&#x27;s personal inclination to Lutheran views on eucharistic presence.&quot;

Historians Patrick Collinson and Peter Lake argue that until 1630 the Church of England was shaped by a &quot;Calvinist consensus&quot;. During this time, Calvinist clergy held the best bishoprics and deaneries. Historians John Coffey and Paul C. H. Lim write that the Elizabethan Church &quot;was widely regarded as a Reformed church, but it was anomalous in retaining certain features of late medieval Catholicism&quot;, such as cathedrals, church choirs, a formal liturgy contained in the prayer book, traditional clerical vestments and episcopal polity.

== Implementation ==

===Episcopal appointments===
To enforce her religious policies, Queen Elizabeth needed bishops willing to cooperate. Seven bishops, including Cardinal Pole, Mary&#x27;s Archbishop of Canterbury, died in 1558 and needed to be replaced. The remaining bishops were all Catholics appointed during Mary&#x27;s reign, and Elizabeth&#x27;s advisers hoped they could be persuaded to continue serving. Ultimately, all but two bishops (the undistinguished Anthony Kitchin of Llandaff and the absentee Thomas Stanley of Sodor and Man) lost their posts. Most of their replacements were not consecrated until December 1559 or early 1560.

Elizabeth chose Matthew Parker to replace Pole as Archbishop of Canterbury. Parker was a prominent scholar and had served as chaplain to Elizabeth&#x27;s mother, Anne Boleyn. Also, like Elizabeth, Parker was a Nicodemite—someone who stayed in England during Mary&#x27;s reign and outwardly conformed to Catholicism. Most of the other posts went to Marian exiles such as Edmund Grindal for London, Richard Cox for Ely, John Jewel for Salisbury, William Barlow for Chichester and John Scory for Hereford. Those exiles with ties to John Calvin&#x27;s reformation in Geneva were notably excluded from consideration. The Queen never forgave John Knox for writing &quot;The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstruous Regiment of Women&quot;, which denounced female monarchs, and the Reformation in Geneva was tainted by association.

===Royal injunctions===
In the summer of 1559, the government conducted a royal visitation of the dioceses. The visitation was conducted according to injunctions based on the Royal Injunctions of 1547. These new royal injunctions were meant to fill in the details of the settlement and were to be enforced nationwide by six groups of clerical and lay commissioners. All of the leading clergymen were Protestants and former exiles (Robert Horne, Thomas Becon, Thomas Bentham, John Jewel, Edwin Sandys, and Richard Davies), and they interpreted the injunctions in the most Protestant way possible.

According to the injunctions, church images that were superstitiously abused were condemned as idolatry, but the commissioners mandated the destruction of all pictures and images. Across the nation, parishes paid to have roods, images and altar tabernacles removed, which they had only recently paid to restore under Queen Mary. They would spend more money on buying Bibles and prayer books and replacing chalices with communion cups (a chalice was designed for the priest alone whereas a communion cup was larger and to be used by the whole congregation).

The Injunctions offered clarity on the matter of vestments. Clergy were to wear the surplice (rather than cope or chasuble) for services. In 1560, the bishops specified that the cope should be worn when administering the Lord&#x27;s Supper and the surplice at all other times. Other provisions of the Royal Injunctions were out of step with the Edwardian Reformation and displayed the Queen&#x27;s conservative preferences. These included injunctions allowing processions to take place at Rogationtide and requirements that clergy receive permission to marry from the bishop and two justices of the peace.

In some instances, the injunctions contradicted the 1559 prayer book. While the prayer book directed the use of ordinary bread for communion, the Injunctions required traditional wafers to be used. There were also conflicting directions for the placement of the communion tables that were to replace stone altars. According to the prayer book, the table should be placed permanently in the chancel oriented east to west. The injunctions ordered the &quot;holy table&quot; to be carried into the chancel during communion services but at all other times to be placed where the altar would have stood. When not in use, it was to be oriented north to south, the same as an altar. These provisions offended many Protestants, and in practice, the Injunctions were often ignored by church leaders.

The Queen was disappointed by the extreme iconoclasm of the Protestants during the visitations. In October 1559, she ordered that a crucifix and candlesticks be placed on the communion table in the Chapel Royal. Later, she decided that roods should be restored in parish churches. Elizabeth&#x27;s bishops protested both moves as revivals of idolatry, arguing that all images were forbidden by the Second Commandment. In the end, the Queen and the bishops reached an unspoken compromise. She kept her crucifix and candles and dropped her plans to restore roods. In 1560, Bishop Grindal was allowed to enforce the demolition of rood lofts in London. A year later, the Queen herself ordered the demolition of all lofts, but the rood beams were to remain on which the royal arms were to be displayed. The Queen still believed there should be a division between the chancel and the rest of the church.

Many parishes were slow to comply with the injunctions. Many did so out of sympathy with traditional Catholic religion, while others waited to see if this religious settlement was permanent before taking expensive action. Churchwardens&#x27; accounts indicate that half of all parishes kept Catholic vestments and Mass equipment for at least a decade. Gradually, however, parishes complied as bishops exerted pressure. Most of the parish clergy were Catholics. Through the mid-1560s, there were an estimated 800 clergy who resigned or were deprived for refusal to conform. Most parish clergy kept their posts, but it is not clear to what degree they conformed. The bishops thought that Catholicism was widespread among the old clergy, but priests were rarely removed because of a clergy shortage that began with an influenza epidemic in 1558.

=== Music ===
Music in the Church of England was limited to biblical texts and music sung during worship in the early church. Examples of permissible music included metrical psalms and liturgical texts such as the &quot;Te Deum&quot;. Although most people were able to sing, worship was dominated by choral liturgies, especially in the cathedrals. During this time, motets were replaced by anthems, and William Byrd&#x27;s &quot;Great Service&quot; was composed for the royal chapel and cathedrals. Parish churches tended to have less music as Puritan influences argued against using of funds to pay for choristers. Churches employed singers for special occasions, which might be paid with money, wine, or ale and bread. The impressment of boys for service as singers in St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and the royal chapel continued during this period.

Devotional singing at home was shared between family and friends. By far the most popular and reprinted metrical Psalter was Thomas Sternhold&#x27;s &quot;Whole book of Psalms&quot;. Although it was not legally required, it was traditional for virtually all Protestant churches and was also used at home.

==Thirty-nine Articles and the Homilies==

The Elizabethan settlement was further consolidated by the adoption of a moderately Protestant doctrinal statement called the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion. While affirming traditional Christian teaching as defined by the first four ecumenical councils, it tried to steer a middle way between Reformed and Lutheran doctrines while rejecting Anabaptist thinking. The Thirty-nine Articles were not intended as a complete statement of the Christian faith but of the position of the Church of England in relation to the Catholic Church and dissident Protestants. In 1571, Convocation finalised the Thirty-nine Articles. It was given statutory force by the Subscription Act, which required all new ministers to affirm their agreement with this confessional statement. 

With the Queen&#x27;s approval, Convocation also issued a second &quot;Book of Homilies&quot; with sermons on 20 topics. One, &quot;Of the Worthy Receiving of the Sacrament&quot;, added more detail to the church&#x27;s doctrine of the Eucharist, which was described as &quot;spiritual food&quot; and &quot;a ghostly substance and not carnal&quot; made real by faith. This receptionist view had much in common with John Calvin&#x27;s Eucharistic theology. &quot;Of Common Prayer and Sacraments&quot; taught that although only baptism and the Eucharist were sacraments instituted by Christ other rites such as ordination had a sacramental character.

==Reception==
The settlement of 1559 had given Protestants control of the Church of England, but matters were different at the parish level, where Catholic priests and traditional laity held large majorities. The bishops struggled for decades to impose the prayer book and Injunctions on reluctant parishes. &quot;For a while, it was possible to sustain an attenuated Catholicism within the parish framework, by counterfeiting the mass, teaching the seven sacraments, preserving images of saints, reciting the rosary, observing feasts, fasts, and customs&quot;. Over time, however, this &quot;survivalist Catholicism&quot; was undermined by pressures to conform, giving way to an underground Catholicism completely separate from the Church of England.

Gradually, England was transformed into a Protestant country as the prayer book shaped Elizabethan religious life. By the 1580s, conformist Protestants (termed &quot;parish anglicans&quot; by Christopher Haigh and &quot;Prayer Book protestants&quot; by Judith Maltby) were becoming a majority. Efforts to introduce further religious reforms through Parliament or by means of Convocation were consistently blocked by the Queen. The Church of England&#x27;s refusal to adopt the patterns of the Continental Reformed churches deepened conflict between Protestants who desired greater reforms and church authorities who prioritised conformity.

===Catholic resistance===

In the early years of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, most Catholics hoped the Protestant ascendancy would be temporary, as it had been prior to Mary&#x27;s restoration of papal authority. There were priests who conformed to the prayer book while also providing the Mass to their parishioners. Others refused to conform. Large numbers of deans, archdeacons, cathedral canons, and academics (mostly from Oxford but also from Cambridge) lost their positions. In the early years, some 300 Catholics fled, especially to the University of Louvain. From there they wrote and published a large body of Catholic polemical work to counter Protestantism, particularly Thomas Harding, Richard Smyth, and William Allen. They also acted as a &quot;Church government in exile&quot;, providing Catholics in England with advice and instructions. In 1568, the English College at Douai was founded to provide a Catholic education to young Englishmen and, eventually, to train a new leadership for a restored Catholic Church in England. Other leading Marian churchmen remained in England to serve as private chaplains to Catholic nobles and gentry. Many became leaders of an underground Catholic Church.
Catholics were forced to choose between attending Protestant services to comply with the law or refusing to attend. Those who refused to attend Church of England services were called recusants. Most Catholics, however, were &quot;church papists&quot;—Catholics who outwardly conformed to the established church while maintaining their Catholic faith in secret. Wealthy church papists attended their parish church but had Mass at home or hired two chaplains, one to perform the prayer book service and the other to perform the Mass. Initially, recusant priests advised the laity to simply abstain from Protestant communion. However, this stance hardened over time. In 1562, the Council of Trent ruled out any outward conformity or Nicodemism for Catholics: &quot;You may not be present at such prayers of heretics, or at their sermons, without heinous offence and the indignation of God, and it is far better to suffer most bitter cruelties than to give the least sign of consent to such wicked and abominable rites.&quot; By the late 1560s, recusancy was becoming more common.

In 1569, the Revolt of the Northern Earls attempted to overthrow England&#x27;s Protestant regime. The rebellion was defeated, but it contributed to a perception that Catholicism was treason. This perception was seemingly confirmed when Elizabeth was excommunicated by Pope Pius V in February 1570. The papal bull &quot;Regnans in Excelsis&quot; released Elizabeth&#x27;s Catholic subjects from any obligation to obey her. Subsequently, two Catholics, John Felton and John Story, were executed for treason. The discovery of the Ridolfi plot–a Catholic conspiracy to overthrow Elizabeth and place Mary, Queen of Scots on the throne–further alarmed the English government.

By 1574, Catholic recusants had organised an underground Catholic Church, distinct from the Church of England. However, it had two major weaknesses: membership loss as church papists conformed fully to the Church of England, and a shortage of priests. The latter problem was addressed by establishing seminaries to train and ordain English priests. In addition to the English College at Douai, a seminary was established at Rome, the &quot;Collegium Anglorum &quot;or English College, and two more were established in Spain in Valladolid and in Seville. Between 1574 and 1603, 600 Catholic priests were sent to England. In 1580, the first Jesuit priests came to England.

The Queen&#x27;s excommunication and the arrival of the seminary priests brought a change in government policy toward recusants. Before 1574, most laymen were not made to take the Oath of Supremacy and the 12&quot;d&quot; fine for missing a service was poorly enforced. Afterwards, efforts to identify recusants and force them to conform increased. In 1581, a new law made it treason to be absolved from schism and reconciled with Rome and the fine for recusancy was increased to £20 per month (50 times an artisan&#x27;s wage). Afterwards, executions of Catholic priests became more common, and in 1585, it became treason for a Catholic priest to enter the country, as well as for anyone to aid or shelter him.

The persecution of 1581–1592 changed the nature of Catholicism in England. The seminary priests were dependent on the gentry families of southern England. As the older generation of recusant priests died out, Catholicism collapsed among the lower classes in the north, west and in Wales. Without priests, these social classes drifted into the Church of England and Catholicism was forgotten. By Elizabeth&#x27;s death, Catholicism had become &quot;the faith of a small sect&quot;, largely confined to gentry households.

===Puritanism===
Leading Protestants within the Church of England were attracted to the Reformed churches of south Germany and Switzerland led by theologians such as John Calvin, Heinrich Bullinger and others. In England, however, Protestants were forced to operate within a church structure unchanged since medieval times with the same threefold orders of bishop, priest and deacon along with church courts that continued to use medieval canon law. In addition, the liturgy remained &quot;more elaborate and more reminiscent of older liturgical forms&quot; and &quot;took no account of developments in Protestant thinking after the early 1550s&quot;. According to historian Diarmaid MacCulloch, the conflicts over the Elizabethan Settlement stem from the &quot;tension between Catholic structure and Protestant theology&quot;.

There were objections over the prayer book, including certain formulas and responses, the sign of the cross in baptism, the surplice and use of a wedding ring in marriage. Throughout her reign, the Queen successfully blocked attempts by Parliament and the bishops to introduce further change. The bishops were placed in the difficult position of enforcing conformity while supporting reform. This was particularly evident between 1565 and 1567 during the Vestments controversy over the refusal of some clergy to wear the clerical dress required by the Royal Injunctions. For many Protestants, clerical vestments symbolised a continued belief in a priestly order separate from the congregation, and could be interpreted by Catholics as affirmation of traditional doctrines. Bishop Jewel called the surplice a &quot;vestige of error&quot;. In general, the bishops considered clerical dress adiaphora and tried to find compromise, but the Queen believed that the church—and herself as supreme governor—had authority to determine rites and ceremonies. In the end, Archbishop Parker issued a code of discipline for the clergy called the Advertisements, and the most popular and effective Protestant preachers were suspended for non-compliance.

The controversy over dress divided the Protestant community, and it was in these years that the term &quot;Puritan&quot; came into use to describe those who wanted further reformation. Some lost faith in the Church of England as an agent of reform, becoming separatists and establishing underground congregations. Most Puritans, however, remained in the Church of England. These Puritans were not without influence, enjoying the support of powerful men such as the Earl of Leicester, Walter Mildmay, Francis Walsingham, the Earl of Warwick and William Cecil. 

In 1572, a bill was introduced in the Queen&#x27;s 4th Parliament that would allow Protestants, with their bishop&#x27;s permission, to omit ceremonies from the 1559 prayer book, and bishops would be further empowered to license clergymen to use the French and Dutch stranger church liturgies. Catholics, however, would have no such freedom. The Queen did not approve, disliking any attempt to undermine the concept of religious uniformity and her own religious settlement.

By 1572, the debate between Puritans and conformists had entered a new phase—church government had replaced vestments as the major issue. While Parliament still met, Thomas Wilcox and John Field published &quot;An Admonition to the Parliament&quot; that condemned &quot;Popish abuses yet remaining in the English Church&quot; and episcopal polity. It called for the church to be organised according to presbyterian polity. In November, &quot;A Second Admonition to Parliament&quot; was published—most likely authored by Thomas Cartwright or Christopher Goodman—which presented a more detailed proposal for church reform along presbyterian lines. John Whitgift of Cambridge University, a leading advocate for conformity, published a reply in October 1572, and he and Cartwright subsequently entered into a pamphlet war. The Admonition Controversy was not a disagreement over soteriology—both Cartwright and Whitgift believed in predestination and that human works played no role in salvation. Rather, the &quot;Admonition&#x27;s&quot; authors believed that presbyterianism was the only biblical form of church government, whereas Whitgift argued that no single form of church government was commanded in the Bible. Under Field&#x27;s leadership, the Classical Movement was active among Puritans within the Church of England throughout the 1570s and 1580s. Puritan clergy in this movement organised local presbyteries or classes, from which the movement took its name. Through the 1580s, Puritans were organised enough to conduct what were essentially covert national synods.

In 1577, Whitgift was made Bishop of Worcester and six years later Archbishop of Canterbury. His rise to power has been identified with a &quot;conservative reaction&quot; against Puritanism. It is more accurate to call Whitgift and those like him conformists, since the word &quot;conservative&quot; carries connotations of Catholicism. The majority of conformists were part of the Reformed consensus that included the Puritans; what divided the parties were disputes over church government. Whitgift&#x27;s first move against the Puritans was a requirement that all clergy subscribe to three articles, the second of which stated that the Prayer Book and Ordinal contained &quot;nothing ... contrary to the word of God&quot;. Whitgift&#x27;s demands produced widespread turmoil, and around 400 ministers were suspended for refusal to subscribe. Under pressure from the Privy Council, Whitgift was forced to accept conditional subscriptions from defiant ministers.

In the Parliaments of 1584 and 1586, the Puritans attempted to push through legislation that would institute a presbyterian form of government for the Church of England and replace the prayer book with the service book used in Geneva. Both attempts failed, mainly because of the Queen&#x27;s opposition. In response, a group of conformists including Richard Bancroft, John Bridges, Matthew Sutcliffe, Thomas Bilson, and Hadrian Saravia began defending the English Church&#x27;s episcopal polity more strongly, no longer merely accepting it as convenient but asserting it as divine law.

In response to Bridges&#x27; &quot;A Defence of the Government Established in the Church of England for Ecclesiastical Matters&quot;, an anonymous Puritan under the pseudonym Martin Marprelate published a series of tracts attacking leading conformist clergy. The 1588 Marprelate Controversy led to the discovery of the presbyterian organisation that had been built up over the years. Its leaders were arrested and the Classical Movement disintegrated. This debacle occurred at the same time that Puritanism&#x27;s most powerful defenders at Court were dying off. In the aftermath of the conformist assault, the 1590s were relatively free of theological controversy. Once Whitgift had destroyed presbyterian activism, he was content to leave the Puritans alone. Likewise, Elizabethan Puritans abandoned the hopeless cause of presbyterianism to focus on less controversial pursuits.

==Legacy==
In 1603, the King of Scotland inherited the English crown as James I. The Church of Scotland was even more strongly Reformed, having a presbyterian polity and John Knox&#x27;s liturgy, the &quot;Book of Common Order&quot;. James was himself a moderate Calvinist, and the Puritans hoped the King would move the English Church in the Scottish direction. James, however, did the opposite, forcing the Scottish Church to accept bishops and the Five Articles of Perth, all attempts to make it as similar as possible to the English Church.

At the start of his reign, Puritans presented the Millenary Petition to the King. This petition for church reform was referred to the Hampton Court Conference of 1604, which agreed to produce a new prayer book, the 1604 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, that incorporated a few changes requested by the Puritans. The most important outcome of the Conference, however, was the decision to produce a new translation of the Bible, the 1611 King James Version. While a disappointment for Puritans, the provisions were aimed at satisfying moderate Puritans and isolating them from their more radical counterparts.

The Church of England&#x27;s dominant theology was still Calvinism, but a group of theologians associated with Bishop Lancelot Andrewes disagreed with many aspects of the Reformed tradition, especially its teaching on predestination. Like the Puritans, Andrewes engaged in his own brand of nonconformity. In his private chapel, he added ceremonies and formulas not authorised in the prayer book, such as burning incense. James I tried to balance the Puritan forces within his church with followers of Andrewes, promoting many of them at the end of his reign. This group was led by Richard Neile of Durham and became known as the Durham House group. They looked to the Church Fathers rather than the Reformers and preferred using the more traditional 1549 prayer book. Due to their belief in free will, this new faction is known as the Arminian party, but their high church orientation was more controversial. 
During the reign of Charles I, the Arminians were ascendant and closely associated with William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury (1633–1645). Laud and his followers believed the Reformation had gone too far and launched a &quot;&#x27;Beauty of Holiness&#x27; counter-revolution, wishing to restore what they saw as lost majesty in worship and lost dignity for the sacerdotal priesthood.&quot; Laudianism, however, was unpopular with both Puritans and Prayer Book Protestants, who viewed the high church innovations as undermining forms of worship they had grown attached to. The English Civil War resulted in the overthrow of Charles I, and a Puritan dominated Parliament began to dismantle the Elizabethan Settlement. Episcopacy was replaced with a semi-presbyterian system. In 1645, the prayer book was made illegal and replaced by the &quot;Directory for Public Worship&quot;. The Directory was not a liturgical book but only a set of directions and outlines for services.

The Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 allowed for the restoration of the Elizabethan Settlement as well. The 1662 prayer book mandated by the 1662 Act of Uniformity was a slightly revised version of the previous book. Many Puritans, however, were unwilling to conform to it. Around 900 ministers refused to subscribe to the new prayer book and were removed from their positions, an event known as the Great Ejection. Puritans became dissenters. Now outside the established church, the different strands of the Puritan movement evolved into separate denominations: Congregationalists, Presbyterians, and Baptists.

The Church of England was fundamentally changed. The &quot;Jacobean consensus&quot; was shattered, and the Church of England began defining itself less broadly. The suppression and marginalisation of Prayer Book Protestants during the 1640s and 1650s had made the prayer book &quot;an undisputed identifier of an emerging Anglican self-consciousness.&quot; Historian Judith Maltby writes that Anglicanism as a recognisable tradition &quot;owes more to the Restoration than the Reformation&quot;. It was in the period after 1660 that Richard Hooker&#x27;s thought became influential within the Church of England, as Anglicans tried to define themselves in ways distinct from Protestant dissenters.

Diarmaid MacCulloch states that Hooker&#x27;s writings helped to create an &quot;Anglican synthesis&quot;. From Hooker, Anglicanism &quot;inherited its belief in the place of reason as an authority for action, its esteem for continuity over the Reformation divide, and a hospitality towards sacramental modes of thought&quot;. From the Arminians, it gained a theology of episcopacy and an appreciation for liturgy. From the Puritans and Calvinists, it &quot;inherited a contradictory impulse to assert the supremacy of scripture and preaching&quot;. 

The clash between Calvinists and Arminians was never resolved, and the &quot;seesaw battle between Catholic and Protestant within a single Anglican ecclesiastical structure has been proceeding ever since&quot;. The preface to the 1662 prayer book defined the Church of England as a &quot;via media&quot; &quot;between the two extremes of too much stiffness in refusing and of too much easiness in admitting any variation&quot;. Historian A. G. Dickens wrote that while Elizabeth I &quot;cannot be credited either with the invention of Anglo-Catholicism or with a prophetic latitudinarian policy which foresaw the rich diversity of Anglicanism. Her preferences of 1558–9 nevertheless make this diversity possible&quot;.

<text>Oberwart (; ; ) is a town in Burgenland in southeast Austria on the banks of the Pinka River, and the capital of the district of the same name. With almost 8,000 inhabitants it’s the third largest town in Burgenland, after Eisenstadt and Neusiedl am See. Oberwart is the cultural capital of the small ethnic Hungarian minority in Burgenland, living in the Upper Őrség or Wart microregion.

==History==
The settlement was established in the 11th century by the guards of the Hungarian frontier (&quot;őr&quot;s) together with Unterwart (&quot;Alsóőr&quot;) and Siget in der Wart (&quot;Őrisziget&quot;). It was first mentioned in historical documents in 1327 under the name &quot;Superior Eör&quot;. It was part of the old county of Vas until 1921. Old surnames and the special local dialect shows that the population was related to the Székelys of Transylvania (i.e. the guards of the eastern border of Kingdom of Hungary).

The community of the &quot;őr&quot;s received the privileges of the nobles by King Charles I of Hungary in the 14th century. The privileges were acknowledged by Rudolph I in 1582. The village was partially destroyed by the Ottoman army in 1532.

Reformation appeared in Felsőőr in the 16th century, and it was backed by the mighty counts of Battyhány. Pastor Ferenc Eőri took part in the synod of 1618. In the Age of Counter-Reformation, most of the region had to return to Roman Catholic faith, but the free noble village of Felsőőr remained Calvinist. In 1673 the army occupied the church and the school to give them back to the Catholics. The rectory was destroyed, and the pastor expelled. The villagers erected a new church in 1681 from wood. According to the laws of the Diet of 1681, Felsőőr became an &quot;articular place&quot; which means that it was the only legal place to practice Protestant religion for the whole region.

The villagers participated in the Hungarian national uprising of István Bocskay in 1605, and of Count Francis II Rákóczi in 1705. In 1706 the Austrian army of General Sigbert Heister sacked Felsőőr. In 1841 the village got the right to hold a market. In the time of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, the villagers defeated (with the help of a Hussar troop) a smaller Croatian army. Later they had to pay a huge amount of tribute to avoid collective punishment.

Geographer Elek Fényes described the village in 1851 as an important and historically significant &quot;őr&quot; settlement:
: &quot;The fields are of only average fertility but the meadows are good. Has got sufficient wood and pasture. The inhabitants are the most diligent in the county: they are not only cultivating flax and breeding horses but they produce cloth and lint, make knives and other ironworks, practice crafts and trade.&quot;
At that time, 41 noble families lived in Felső-Őr. Some typical family names were: Ádám, Adorján, Albert, Andorkó, Balás, Bertha, Bertók, Fábián, Fülöp, Gál, Imre, Kázmér, Miklós, Orbán, Pál, Pongrácz, etc.

After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, the village began to develop rapidly, and the population reached 3900 people in 1910. According to the Treaty of Trianon in 1920, Felsőőr was annexed by Austria, but the Hungarian population opposed the decision and organised a movement to establish the autonomous province of Lajtabánság. In November 1921, the Austrian army occupied the village.

After the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938, the Jewish inhabitants of the village (appr. 140 people) were deported, and the synagogue was transformed into a fire department depot. According to the Nazi policy of Germanisation, the old Hungarian school of the Reformed Church was secularized. In 1939 Oberwart was incorporated as a town. In April 1945 the Red Army occupied Oberwart after a week of fierce fighting and plundered the half-destroyed town. In the 1950s and 1960s, Oberwart was rebuilt and thoroughly modernized. On 2 September 1984, the European number-one hit Live Is Life by Opus was recorded on a concert in Oberwart in a live version with the audience singing along.

On 5 February 1995, close to a Romani housing in Oberwart, Franz Fuchs, an Austrian domestic terrorist, killed four young Romani men using a booby trap connected to a sign with the words &quot;Roma zurück nach Indien&quot; (&quot;Roma go back to India&quot;).

==Sights==
* Reformed Church - The present imposing Baroque church was built in 1771-73 by Christoph Preising. The tower was built in 1808-09 by Matthias Preising. The furniture, the pulpit and the ecclesiastical equipment are valuable art pieces from the 18-19th centuries.
* Old Rectory - The Old Rectory was built in 1784, next to the Reformed Church in rural Baroque style, with an arcaded porch. It was enlarged in 1823. Today it is a community center and museum. The old documents of the Calvinist community (for example the parish registers since 1732) are important historical sources.
* Former School of the Reformed Church - The famous school of the church was founded in the 17th century. The old school building behind the church was built in 1802.
*Old Parish Church - The old parish church of the Ascension was enlarged and rebuilt in Gothic style in 1463. In the 16-17th centuries it was a Calvinist church. The huge tower was built that time in 1656 under the pastoral service of János Szeremley. The church was rebuilt in Baroque style in 1728 and 1778. The restoration in 1975 revealed the medieval architectural details and murals in the apse from the 14th century (St George and St Michael). The furniture is Baroque from the 18th century.
*New Parish Church - The modern concrete-and-glass church and religious center was built in 1967-69 by the plans of Günther Domenig and Eilfried Huth.
* Evangelical Church - It was built between 1812 and 1815 in Neo-Classical style. The evangelical parish has been always the third in numbers behind the other two religion in Oberwart (for example 684 people in 1880 and 1198 in 2001).
* Flea Market - On the first Saturday of every month, a flea market is held in central Oberwart.

==Hungarians==

In the course of the 20th century a language shift occurred in local population, changing the use of Hungarian to German. Magyars lost their historical majority in Felsőőr/Oberwart but the town remained the most important Hungarian educational, religious and cultural centre in Burgenland.

Nowadays there are appr. 1100 ethnic Hungarian inhabitants of the town, mostly members of the Calvinist parish. Felsőőr is the oldest Calvinist congregation in Austria. The Christian Reading Club of Young Men (founded in 1889) is an important cultural association of the Hungarian minority with a library, folk dance group and theater group. The new cultural center of the Calvinist Church was built in 1956-57. The Hungarian kindergarten was reestablished after World War II in 1951 and a new Bilingual Secondary School was set up in 1992.

The old Hungarian district of the town is called Fölszeg (i.e. Upper End). The neighbourhood is the oldest part of the town with narrow lanes and more than one hundred old houses which are typical examples of the rural architecture of the Felső-Őrség. The vaulted porches and the stuccoed gables are characteristic architectural features.

==Coat-of-arms==
The old coat-of-arms of Felsőőr depicted a medieval Hungarian frontier-guard (Hungarian: &quot;őr&quot;) with two swords in his hands, one raised as the symbol of attack, the other crossed as the symbol of defence. The inscription of the arms was &quot;Nobiles de Felső-Eőr&quot;. The new coat-of-arms of Oberwart was granted in 1972. The main feature of the old arms - the figure of the frontier-guard - was kept but the details changed and the inscription disappeared.

==Demographics==

According to geographer Elek Fényes, in 1851 Felső-Őr was a Hungarian village with a population of 2323 people. Calvinists were the largest religious group (60%), followed by Roman Catholics (26%), Lutherans (13%) and only 10 Jews.

The population statistics of Oberwart/Felsőőr recorded by official Hungarian and Austrian censuses were:

The population of the town increased continuously during the last 150 years with only two smaller setbacks caused by World War I and World War II. Hungarians were the most populous ethnicity until 1951 when German speaking people were recorded for the first time as the largest group. The number of Hungarians reached its peak in 1920 with 3,138 people (75% of the total population). In the second half of the 20th century they decreased both in numbers and percentage, reaching the lowest point in 1971 with only 204 people. The community was growing again in the last decades of the century. The small Roma minority disappeared after the hardships of Nazi rule. The number of Croatians only began growing in the last two decades of the 20th century.

<text>The Magic Mountain (, ) is a novel by Thomas Mann. It was first published in German in November 1924. It&#x27;s considered by critics to be one of the most influential works of 20th-century German literature.

== Background ==
Mann started writing &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot; in 1912. It began as a novella that revisited aspects of &quot;Death in Venice&quot; (another novel written by Mann) in a humorous way. The newer work reflected his experiences and impressions during a period when his wife, who was suffering from respiratory disease, resided at Dr. in Davos, Switzerland. In May and June 1912, Mann visited her and became acquainted with the team of doctors and patients. According to Mann, in the afterword that was later included in the English translation of his novel, this stay inspired his opening chapter (&quot;Arrival&quot;).

The outbreak of World War I interrupted his work on the book. Like many other Germans, Mann supported the German Empire. In a particular mental state he described as &quot;sympathy with death&quot;, he wrote the essays &quot;&quot;Gedanken im Kriege&quot;, &quot;Gute Feldpost&quot; and &quot;Friedrich und die große Koalition&quot;, examples of an intellectual military service which he regarded as his duty. In response to anti-war intellectuals, Thomas Mann wrote a long essay, &quot;Reflections of a Nonpolitical Man&quot;, which came out in 1918. However, his position was shaken by these intellectuals, such as his older brother Heinrich who, unlike Thomas, did not support the German state. On the contrary, Heinrich was the author of the satirical novel &quot;Der Untertan&quot; and the essay &quot;Zola&quot;&quot;, where he defended the idea of an inevitable defeat of Germany which would then lead to its democratization. The end of the war led Thomas Mann to rethink his position, and in 1919 he changed the tone of the novel to reflect the reality of war rather than a romanticized depiction of it, and to include conflict between characters that was inspired by the one between his brother and himself. 

Mann undertook a major re-examination of European bourgeois society. He explored the sources of the destructiveness displayed by much of civilized humanity. He was also drawn to speculate about more general questions related to personal attitudes to life, health, illness, sexuality, and mortality. His political stance during this period changed from opposing the Weimar Republic to supporting it. &quot;Der Zauberberg&quot; was eventually published in two volumes by S. Fischer Verlag in Berlin.

==Plot summary==

The narrative opens in the decade before World War I. It introduces the protagonist, Hans Castorp, the only child of a Hamburg merchant family. Following the early death of his parents, Castorp was brought up by his grandfather and, later, by a maternal uncle named James Tienappel. Castorp is in his early 20s, about to take up a shipbuilding career in Hamburg, his hometown. Before beginning work, he undertakes a journey to visit his tubercular cousin, Joachim Ziemssen, who is seeking a cure in a sanatorium in Davos, high up in the Swiss Alps. In the opening chapter, Castorp leaves his familiar life and obligations, in what he later learns to call &quot;the flatlands&quot;, to visit the rarefied mountain air and introspective small world of the sanatorium.

Castorp&#x27;s departure from the sanatorium is repeatedly delayed by his failing health. What at first appears to be a minor bronchial infection with a slight fever is diagnosed by the sanatorium&#x27;s chief doctor and director, Hofrat Behrens, as symptoms of tuberculosis. Castorp is persuaded by Behrens to stay until his health improves.

During his extended stay, Castorp meets various characters, who represent pre-war Europe in miniature. These include Lodovico Settembrini (an Italian humanist and encyclopedist, a student of Giosuè Carducci); Leo Naphta, a Jewish Jesuit who favors communistic totalitarianism; Mynheer Peeperkorn, a dionysian Dutchman; and his romantic interest, Madame Clawdia Chauchat.

Castorp eventually resides at the sanatorium for seven years. As the novel concludes, the war begins, and Castorp volunteers for the military. His possible demise upon the battlefield is portended.

==Literary significance and criticism==
&quot;The Magic Mountain&quot; can be read both as a classic example of the European – a &quot;novel of education&quot; or &quot;novel of formation&quot; – and as a satire of this genre. Many formal elements of are present: the protagonist starts as immature and by leaving his home he learns about art, culture, politics, human frailty, and love.. 

Reflections on topics such as the experience of time, music, nationalism, sociology, and changes in the natural world are embedded in the novel. Castorp&#x27;s stay in the rarefied air of &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot; gives him a panoramic view of pre-war European civilization and its discontents.. 

Mann describes the subjective experience of serious illness and the gradual process of medical institutionalization. He also alludes to the irrational forces within the human psyche, at a time when Freudian psychoanalysis was becoming a prominent type of treatment. These themes relate to the development of Castorp&#x27;s character over the period covered by the novel. In his discussion of the work, written in English and published in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; in January 1953, Mann states that &quot;what [Hans] came to understand is that one must go through the deep experience of sickness and death to arrive at a higher sanity and health...&quot;.

Mann also acknowledged his debt to the skeptical insights of Friedrich Nietzsche concerning modern humanity, and he drew from these in creating conversations between the characters. Throughout the book the author employs the discussions among Settembrini, Naphta, and the medical staff to introduce the young Castorp to a wide spectrum of competing ideologies about responses to the Age of Enlightenment. However, a classical would conclude by Castorp&#x27;s having become a mature member of society , with his own worldview and greater self-knowledge, while &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot; ends with Castorp&#x27;s becoming one of millions of anonymous conscripts under fire on a World War I battlefield.

==Major themes==
===Connection to &quot;Death in Venice&quot;===
Mann wrote that he originally planned &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot; as a novella, a humorous, ironic, satirical (and satiric) follow-up to &quot;Death in Venice&quot;, which he had completed in 1912. The atmosphere was to derive from the &quot;mixture of death and amusement&quot; that Mann had encountered while visiting his wife in a Swiss sanatorium. He intended to transfer to a comedic plane the fascination with death and triumph of ecstatic disorder over a life devoted to order, which he had explored in &quot;Death in Venice&quot;.

The atmosphere and the character&#x27;s journey in &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot; contrasts considerably with the earlier novella. Whereas the protagonist of the novella was the mature and acclaimed author Gustav von Aschenbach, the central figure is now a callow young engineer at the outset of an anticipated career. The alluring Polish adolescent Tadzio in the novella corresponds to the Asiatic-flabby (&quot;asiatisch-schlaff&quot;) Russian Madame Chauchat. The setting has shifted from the densely populated island city on the Adriatic coast to an alpine, quasi resort-like sanatorium prized for its (alleged) health-restoring properties.

===Illness and death===
The patients suffer from some form of tuberculosis, which rules their daily routines, thoughts, and conversations of the &quot;half lung club&quot;. The disease ends fatally for many of the patients, such as the Catholic girl Barbara Hujus, whose fear of death is heightened in a harrowing Viaticum scene, and cousin Ziemssen, who leaves this world like an ancient hero. The dialogues between Settembrini and Naphta examine life and death from a metaphysical perspective. Besides the deaths from fatal illness, two characters commit suicide, and finally Castorp goes off to fight in World War I, and it is implied that he will be killed on the battlefield.

In the above-mentioned comment Mann writes:

What Castorp learns to fathom is that all higher health must have passed through illness and death... As Hans Castorp once said to Madame Chauchat, there are two ways to life: One is the common, direct, and brave. The other is bad, leading through death, and that is the genius way. This concept of illness and death, as a necessary passage to knowledge, health, and life, makes &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot; into a novel of initiation. 

===Time===
The treatment of time () is a major narrative and philosophical concern in the novel. The novel&#x27;s structure reflects this through its asymmetrical handling of chronology: the first five chapters (approximately half the novel) detail only the initial year of Castorp&#x27;s stay, while the final two chapters compress the remaining six years. 

Mann addresses time both as a narrative device and a philosophical concept. Chapter VII, titled &quot;By the Ocean of Time,&quot; opens with the narrator directly questioning the possibility of narrating time itself. The characters frequently discuss theories of time perception, debating whether time passes more quickly or slowly depending on circumstance and routine.

Contemporary philosophical discussions of time, particularly Henri Bergson&#x27;s concepts of duration and subjective time experience, informed Mann&#x27;s approach. This influence is evident in the novel&#x27;s exploration of how time appears to accelerate or decelerate based on the characters&#x27; experiences in the sanatorium setting.

&quot;The Magic Mountain&quot;, in essence, embodies the author&#x27;s meditations on the &quot;tempo&quot; of experience.

The narrative is ordered chronologically but accelerates throughout the novel, so that the first five chapters (approximately half of the text) relate the first of Castorp&#x27;s seven years at the sanatorium in great detail; the remaining six years, marked by monotony and routine, are described in the last two chapters. This asymmetry corresponds to Castorp&#x27;s own skewed perception of the passage of time.

This structure reflects the protagonist&#x27;s thoughts. Throughout the book, they discuss the philosophy of time and debate whether &quot;interest and novelty dispel or shorten the content of time, while monotony and emptiness hinder its passage&quot;. The characters also reflect on the problems of narration and time, about the correspondence between the length of a narrative and the duration of the events it describes.

Mann also meditates upon the interrelationship between the experience of time and space; of time seeming to pass more slowly when one does not move in space. This aspect of the novel mirrors contemporary philosophical and scientific debates which are embodied in Heidegger&#x27;s writings and Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity, in which space and time are inseparable. In essence, Castorp&#x27;s subtly transformed perspective on the &quot;flat-lands&quot; corresponds to a movement in time.

===Magic and mountains===

The titular reference to &#x27;mountain&#x27; reappears in many layers. The sanatorium is located on a mountain, both geographically and figuratively, a separate world. The mountain also represents the opposite of Castorp&#x27;s home, the sober, businesslike &quot;flatland&quot;.

The first part of the novel culminates and ends in the sanatorium Carnival feast. There, in a grotesque scene named after Walpurgis Night, the setting is transformed into the Blocksberg, where according to German tradition, witches and wizards meet in obscene revelry. This is also described in Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust I&quot;. At this event, Castorp woos Madame Chauchat; their subtle conversation is carried on almost wholly in French.

Another topos of German literature is the Venus Mountain (), which is referred to in Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;. This mountain is a &quot;hellish paradise&quot;, a place of lust and abandon, where time flows differently: the visitor loses all sense of time. Castorp, who planned to stay at the sanatorium for three weeks, does not leave the for seven years.

In general, the inhabitants of the spend their days in a mythical, distant atmosphere. The X-ray laboratory in the cellar represents the Hades of Greek mythology, where Medical Director Behrens acts as the judge and punisher Rhadamanthys and where Castorp is a fleeting visitor, like Odysseus. Behrens compares the cousins to Castor and Pollux; Settembrini compares himself to Prometheus. Frau Stöhr mentions Sisyphus and Tantalus, albeit confusedly.

The culmination of the second part of the novel is perhaps the – still &quot;episodic&quot; – chapter of Castorp&#x27;s blizzard dream (in the novel simply called &quot;Snow&quot;). The protagonist gets into a sudden blizzard, beginning a death-bound sleep, dreaming at first of beautiful meadows with blossoms and of lovable young people at a southern seaside; then of a scene reminiscent of a grotesque event in Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust I&quot; (&quot;the witches&#x27; kitchen&quot;, again in Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Blocksberg chapter&quot;); and finally ending with a dream of extreme cruelty – the slaughtering of a child by two witches, priests of a classic temple. According to Mann, this represents the original and deathly destructive force of nature itself.

Castorp awakens in due time, escapes from the blizzard, and returns to the . But rethinking his dreams, he concludes that &quot;because of charity and love, man should never allow death to rule one&#x27;s thoughts&quot;. Castorp soon forgets this sentence, so for him the blizzard event remains an interlude. This is the only sentence in the novel that Mann highlighted by italics.

There are frequent references to &quot;Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot;, based on European myths. The opulent meals are compared to the magically self-laying table of &quot;Table, Donkey, and Stick&quot;; Frau Engelhardt&#x27;s quest to learn the first name of Madame Chauchat mirrors that of the queen in &quot;Rumpelstiltskin&quot;. Castorp&#x27;s given name is the same as &quot;Clever Hans&quot;. Although the ending is not explicit, it is possible that Castorp dies on the battlefield. Mann leaves his fate unresolved.
Mann makes use of the number seven, often believed to have magical qualities: Castorp was seven when his parents died; he stays seven years at the , from the years 1907 to 1914; the central Walpurgis Night scene happens after seven months, both cousins have seven letters in their last name, the dining hall has seven tables, Madame Chauchat is initially assigned room number 7, the digits of Castorp&#x27;s room number (34) add up to seven, and Joachim&#x27;s room is a multiple of seven (28=7×4). Settembrini&#x27;s name includes &#x27;seven&#x27; () in Italian, Joachim keeps a thermometer in his mouth for seven minutes, and Mynheer Peeperkorn announces his suicide in a group of seven. Joachim decides to leave after a stay of seven times seventy days, and dies at seven o&#x27;clock. The novel itself, moreover, is divided into seven chapters.

===Music===

Hans Castorp loved music from his heart; it worked upon him much the same way as did his breakfast porter, with deeply soothing, narcotic effect, tempting him to doze. (Chapter 3)

There is something suspicious about music, gentlemen. I insist that she is, by her nature, equivocal. I shall not be going too far in saying at once that she is politically suspect. (Herr Settembrini, ch. 4)

Mann gives a central role to music in this novel. People at the listen to &quot;Der Lindenbaum&quot; from the &quot;Winterreise&quot; played on a gramophone. This piece is full of mourning in the view of death and hints of an invitation to suicide. In the book&#x27;s final scene, Castorp, now an ordinary soldier on Germany&#x27;s western front in World War I, hums the song to himself as his unit advances in battle.

===Allegorical characters===
Mann uses the novel&#x27;s main characters to introduce Castorp to the ideas and ideologies of his time. The author observed that the characters are all &quot;exponents, representatives, and messengers of intellectual districts, principles, and worlds,&quot; hoping that he had not made them mere wandering allegories.

====Castorp====

According to the author, the protagonist is a questing knight, the &quot;pure fool&quot; looking for the Holy Grail in the tradition of Parzival. However, he remains pale and mediocre, representing a German bourgeois that is torn between conflicting influences – capable of the highest humanistic ideals, yet at the same time prone to both stubborn philistinism and radical ideologies. As usual, Mann chooses his protagonist&#x27;s name carefully: &#x27;Hans&#x27; is a generic German first name, almost anonymous, but also refers to the fairy tale figure of &quot;Hans im Glück&quot; and the apostle St. John (Johannes in German), the favourite disciple of Jesus, who beholds the Revelation ( in German). Castorp is the name of a historically prominent family in Mann&#x27;s hometown, Lübeck, which provided at least three generations of Mayors for the town in the era of the Renaissance. The &quot;torp&quot; is Danish, not unexpected on the German north coast. Castorp also refers to the twins Castor and Pollux in Greek mythology, who were identified by the New Testament scholar Dennis MacDonald as models for the apostles James and John.

In a way, Hans Castorp can be seen as the incorporation of the young Weimar Republic: Both humanism and radicalism, represented by Settembrini and Naphta, try to win his favour, but Castorp is unable to decide. His body temperature is a subtle metaphor for his lack of clarity: Following Schiller’s theory of fever, Castorp’s temperature is , which is neither healthy nor ill, but an intermediate point. Furthermore, the outside temperature in Castorp&#x27;s residence is out of balance: it is either too warm or too cold and tends to extremes (e.g. snow in August), but never normal. According to Christian Kracht, &quot;Hans Castorp experienced the elevation of his temperature as lifting him to an elevated state of being.&quot;

The most pronounced instances of Thomas Mann&#x27;s political conversion is in the &quot;Schnee&quot; (snow) chapter. Completed in June 1923, this chapter, which forms the philosophical heart of the novel, attempts to overcome apparent contrasts and find a compromise between Naphta&#x27;s and Settembrini&#x27;s positions. In the chapter &quot;Humaniora&quot;, written in 1920, Castorp tells Behrens, in a discussion on medical matters, that an interest in life means an interest in death. In the &quot;Schnee&quot; chapter, Castorp comes to exactly the opposite conclusion. The basis for Castorp&#x27;s contradiction can be found in the speech &quot;On the German Republic&quot; (), written in the previous year, in which Mann outlines his position with regards to precedence of life and humanity over death. Even though Castorp could not possibly have learnt from either Naphta or Settembrini the idea that the experience of death is ultimately that of life and leads to a new appreciation of humanity, Mann was determined from at least September 1922 onwards to make this message the main point of his novel. In a letter of 4 September 1922 to Arthur Schnitzler, Mann refers to &quot;Von deutscher Republik&quot;, in which, he says, he is endeavouring to win the German middle classes over to the cause of the Republic and humanitarian concerns, and adds that his new-found passion for humanitarianism is closely related to the novel on which he is working. In the climax of the &quot;Schnee&quot; chapter, Castorp&#x27;s vision is of the triumph of life, love and human concern over sickness and death. This realisation corresponds closely to Mann&#x27;s key observation in &quot;Von deutscher Republik&quot;. As if to dispel any lingering doubts, Mann makes the meaning absolutely clear in his &quot;Tischrede in Amsterdam&quot; [Dinner speech in Amsterdam], held on 3 May 1924. Death stands for the ultra-conservative opponents of the Republic, while life embodies the supporters of democracy, the only way to guarantee a humanitarian future. The &quot;Schnee&quot; chapter was written in the first half of 1923 and the italicisation of the key sentence was probably requested by Mann when the book was set in print in 1924, as a message to the readers of the time, who, after years of hyper-inflation and political turmoil, not only expected but also desperately needed a positive direction to their lives, some words of wisdom which would give them hope.

====Settembrini: Humanism====
Settembrini represents the active and positive ideal of the Enlightenment, of Humanism, democracy, tolerance and human rights. He often finds Castorp literally in the dark and switches on the light before their conversations. He compares himself to Prometheus of Greek mythology, who brought fire and enlightenment to Man. His own mentor Giosuè Carducci has even written a hymn to another lightbringer: Lucifer, &quot;la forza vindice della ragione.&quot; His ethics are based on bourgeois values and labor. He tries to counter Castorp&#x27;s morbid fascination with death and disease, warns him against the ill Madame Chauchat, and tries to demonstrate a positive outlook on life.

His antagonist Naphta describes him as &quot;Zivilisationsliterat&quot;, meaning cosmopolitan, un-German intellectuals. Mann originally constructed Settembrini as a caricature of the liberal-democratic novelist represented, for example, by his own brother Heinrich Mann. However, while the novel was being written, Mann himself became an outspoken supporter of the Weimar Republic, precipitated by the assassination of then German Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau whom Mann deeply admired, which may explain why Settembrini, especially in the later chapters, becomes the &quot;Sprachrohr des Autoren&quot; (the voice of the author).

Settembrini&#x27;s physical characteristics are reminiscent of the Italian composer Ruggiero Leoncavallo.

====Naphta: Radicalism====
Settembrini&#x27;s antagonist Naphta was Jewish but joined the Jesuits and became a Hegelian Marxist. The character was a parody of the philosopher Georg Lukács, who &quot;plainly has not recognized himself in Naphta&quot;, wrote Mann in a 1949 letter.

Even here a change in Mann&#x27;s political stance can be seen. In &quot;Operationes spirituales&quot; from Chapter VI, written towards the end of 1922, Naphta is termed a &quot;revolutionary&quot; and &quot;socialist&quot;, but Settembrini sees Naphta&#x27;s fantasies as emanating from an anti-humanitarian reactionary revolution (&quot;Revolution des antihumanen Rückschlages&quot;). In this chapter, the terrorism championed by Naphta is no longer, in Castorp&#x27;s eyes, associated solely with the &quot;Diktatur des Proletariats&quot;, but also with conservative Prussian militarism and Jesuitism. The association here between Naphta&#x27;s advocacy of terrorism and two extremely conservative movements – Prussian militarism and Jesuitism – is a huge political shift for the novel. Terrorism, up till now exclusively the province of the communist revolution, is now suddenly also an instrument of reactionary conservatism. In a clear allusion on Mann&#x27;s part to the assassination of Walther Rathenau, Naphta goes into the motivation of the revolutionary who killed Councillor of State August von Kotzebue in 1819, and concludes that it was not just the desire for freedom at stake here but also moral fanaticism and political outrage. That this is a direct reference to the death of Rathenau is borne out by the fact that in the first edition Mann refers to the shooting of Kotzebue, whereas he was in fact stabbed. Alerted to this mistake by Max Rieger, Mann replied on 1 September 1925 that he would rectify the error at the first opportunity. Mann changed the word to for future editions. For the 1924 readership, however, the association with Rathenau could not have been clearer.

====Chauchat: Love and temptation====
Clawdia Chauchat represents erotic temptation, lust, and love, all in a degenerate, morbid, &quot;Asiatic-flabby&quot; form. She is one of the major reasons for Castorp&#x27;s extended stay on the magic mountain. The female promise of sensual pleasure as hindrance to male zest for action imitates the themes from the Circe mythos and in the nymphs in Wagner&#x27;s Venus Mountain. Chauchat&#x27;s feline characteristics are noted often, her last name is derived from the French [hot cat], and her first name includes the English &#x27;claw&#x27;. (Her name may also be a reference to the Chauchat machine gun,
a French weapon that saw significant use by the French and American forces during World War I.) ChaudChat could also be a play on words with &#x27;chaud&#x27; [hot] and &#x27;chatte&#x27; [female genitalia] in French slang.

Clawdia Chauchat leaves the for some time, but she returns with an impressive companion, Mynheer Peeperkorn, who suffers from a tropical disease.

====Peeperkorn: The Dionysian principle====

Mynheer Peeperkorn, Clawdia Chauchat&#x27;s new lover, enters the scenery late, but he is one of the most commanding persons of the novel. His behavior and personality, with its flavour of importance, combined with obvious awkwardness and the strange inability ever to complete a statement, is reminiscent of certain figures in former novellas of the author (e.g. Herr Klöterjahn in &quot;Tristan&quot;) – figures, which are, on the one hand, admired because of their vital energy, and, on the other hand, condemned because of their naïveté. In total, this person represents the grotesqueness of a Dionysian character. The Greek god Dionysus is also important in Nietzschean philosophy, whose &quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot; is the source of the title &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot;.

Peeperkorn ends his life by suicide, also performed in a strange manner.

Mynheer Peeperkorn was used by the author to personify his rival, the influential German poet Gerhart Hauptmann, and even certain aspects of Goethe (with whom Hauptmann often was compared). &quot;One scholar has postulated that the character of Mynheer Peeperkorn ... who revels in lavish meals ... was intended as a mirror image of Kafka&#x27;s hunger artist...&quot;

====Ziemssen: Duty====
Joachim Ziemssen, Hans Castorp&#x27;s cousin, is described as a young person representing the ideals of loyalty and faithfulness as an officer. As already mentioned, Dr. Behrens alludes to the pair as &quot;Castor(p) and Pollux&quot;, the twin brothers of the Greek mythology. And in fact, there is some affinity between the two cousins, both in their love to Russian women (Clawdia Chauchat in the case of Hans Castorp, the female co-patient &quot;Marusja&quot; in the case of Joachim Ziemssen), and also in their ideals. But, in contrast to Hans Castorp, who is an assertive person on the scene, Joachim Ziemssen is rather shy, known to stand somehow outside of the community. He tries to escape from what he, unspokenly, feels to be a morbid atmosphere. After long discussions with his cousin, and in spite of being warned by Dr. Behrens, he returns to the &quot;flatlands&quot;, where he fulfills his military duties for some time. But after a while, forced by deterioration of his lungs, he returns to the . It is, however, too late for a successful treatment of his illness, and he dies in the sanitarium. His death is described in a moving chapter of the novel, with the title &quot;As a soldier, and a good one&quot; [(Ich sterbe) als Soldat und brav], again a well-known citation from Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;.

==In popular culture==
&quot;The Magic Mountain&quot; is mentioned in the film &quot;The Wind Rises&quot; (2013), directed by Hayao Miyazaki, by a German character named Hans Castorp.

Nobel Laureate Czesław Miłosz borrowed the title for his poem, &quot;A Magic Mountain&quot;.

The novel is mentioned in &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; episode &quot;That&#x27;s My Boy??&quot; (season 3, episode 1). With all the mix-ups at the hospital between the Petries and the Peters, and each getting the other&#x27;s stuff, Rob is trying to determine if he and Laura brought home the right baby, so he goes to check the baby&#x27;s footprints, which he tells his neighbor are kept in &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot;. &quot;Huh?&quot; says Jerry. &quot;The book&quot;, says Rob. Jerry finds the footprints and reads the book&#x27;s title, &quot;Oh, Thomas Mann&quot;, and then they cover the kid&#x27;s foot with blue ink.

The 2016 psychological horror film &quot;A Cure for Wellness&quot; was inspired by Mann&#x27;s novel.

<text>Murska Sobota (, Slovenian abbreviation: &quot;MS&quot; ; ; ) is a town in northeastern Slovenia. It is the centre of the Municipality of Murska Sobota near the Mura River in the region of Prekmurje and is the regional capital.

==Name==

Officially, the town is known as Murska Sobota, although informally it is usually simply referred to as &quot;Sobota&quot; by its inhabitants and &quot;Murska&quot; by people from other parts of Slovenia. The settlement was first attested in written documents in 1297 as &quot;Belmura&quot; (and as &quot;Murazombatha&quot; in 1348 and &quot;Murazumbota&quot; in 1366). The traditional German name of the town is &quot;Olsnitz&quot;, which is derived from the old Slovene name &quot;Olšnica&quot;. The modern Slovene name is a translation of the Hungarian name &quot;Muraszombat,&quot; which was the official name of the town until 1919. In Hungarian, &quot;szombat&quot; means &#x27;Saturday&#x27;, referring to the town&#x27;s practice of holding fairs every week on that day. Murska Sobota was a district () town of Vas County in the Kingdom of Hungary until 1918. Along with most of Prekmurje, it was annexed by Hungary during World War II, from 1941 to 1944. Between 1944 and 1945 it was under Nazi German occupation, and it was captured by Soviet troops in May 1945. It was also part of the Balatin Sanjak under Ottoman Turkey, which belonged at first to the Budin Eyalet, later the Kanije Eyaleti, before the Treaty of Karlowitz.

==History==

Murska Sobota used to be Yugoslavia&#x27;s northernmost town, and throughout history it has shifted across borders between Slovenia, Yugoslavia, and Hungary. Hungarians still represent a 3,000-person minority. In 1919, the Republic of Prekmurje was declared here and the town was the capital of the new state. In 1991, during the Ten-Day War between Slovenia and the Yugoslav Federal Army, Murska Sobota was bombed from the air, with no casualties or visible damage. Today, it is a quiet town with an economy based on regional administration, light industry, commerce, and spa tourism. In April 2006, the town became the see of the newly created Roman Catholic Diocese of Murska Sobota, which is a suffragan to the archdiocese of Maribor.

===Jewish community of Murska Sobota===
The once significant Jewish community of Murska Sobota was eliminated by Nazi Germany. Before World War II, a synagogue built by Lipót Baumhorn stood in Murska Sobota. It was consecrated on 31 August 1908 and demolished in 1954 by the local communist authorities after they purchased the building from a decimated Jewish community. The last rabbi in Murska Sobota was Lazar Roth. He was murdered at Auschwitz.

On 26 April 1944, all of the Jews were ordered to gather in the Murska Sobota synagogue, with hand luggage only. There, they were locked up overnight without food or water, and the next morning all the Jews of Murska Sobota were transferred to Čakovec and then to Nagykanizsa, the main concentration camp before their final destination of Auschwitz.

On 29 January 2010, the first Holocaust memorial in Slovenia was unveiled at the Murska Sobota railway station. It is dedicated to the exile of Jews from the Prekmurje region.

== Culture ==
The city appears in Aleksandar Hemon&#x27;s humorous autobiographical story “Everything,” published in The New Yorker in 2005 and concerning an overly-dramatic Sarajevo teenager&#x27;s mission to purchase the best chest freezer available on the former Yugoslav market. In the course of his trip, young Hemon laments,“[...] &quot;you sent me to the monstrous city, to the endless night,&quot; [...] &quot;you sent me to Murska Sobota.&quot;”

==Climate==

Annual rainfall in Murska Sobota is among the lowest in Slovenia. Characterized by the instability of rainfall, severe droughts are frequent. It has a warm-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;) that is uncommon in Slovenia except at higher elevations,

<doc id="539708" wikidata="Q1354159" url="?curid=539708" title="Johnny Bower">
<text>John William Bower (né Kiszkan; November 8, 1924 – December 26, 2017) nicknamed &quot;The China Wall&quot;, was a Canadian ice hockey goaltender and inductee to the Hockey Hall of Fame, who won four Stanley Cups during his career with the Toronto Maple Leafs. In 2017 he was named one of the &quot;100 Greatest NHL Players&quot; in history. His song &quot;Honky (The Christmas) Goose&quot; reached #29 on the CHUM Charts in December 1965.

==Playing career==
Bower was born John William Kiszkan into a Ukrainian-Canadian family in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, to Johnny Kiszkan, a labourer born Dmytro Kiszkan, and his wife, Lizzie, née Jacobson. (His father had previously been a homesteader.) He had one brother and seven sisters. He taught himself how to play hockey, using a branch as a stick, and made himself goalie pads out of old mattresses. Around age 10, his parents separated. An uncommon practice at the time, it created a stigma around the family in their town. When he was 15, he lied about his age and enlisted in the Canadian Army during World War II; from 1940 to 1943 he was stationed in England as a gunner with the 2nd Canadian Division. He was discharged due to rheumatoid arthritis in his hands.

Kiszkan returned to Prince Albert in 1944 to play junior hockey there. In 1945, he turned professional in the American Hockey League (AHL), where he spent eleven seasons playing mostly for the Cleveland Barons in the late 1940s and 1950s.

Bower told various stories about his name change, including that &quot;Bower&quot; was his mother&#x27;s maiden name, or that he was adopted. Biographer Dan Robson was also told that Barons management may have asked him to, to avoid the post-war discrimination against eastern Europeans, while other sources claim that it was because sports writers often misspelled &quot;Kiszkan&quot;. His parents&#x27; break up may also have been a factor, suggests Robson, as Bower rarely talked about the situation. His surname was legally changed during his first year of professional hockey. Robson&#x27;s 2018 book, &quot;Bower: A Legendary Life&quot;, dedicates a chapter to the topic.

In the AHL, he proved himself the star goaltender of the circuit, winning numerous awards and leading his teams to three Calder Cup championships.

Bower made his debut in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the New York Rangers in , at the age of 29. The Rangers made him their starting goaltender over Gump Worsley, who had been rookie of the year the previous season. Bower played in all 70 games that season and recorded 29 wins. The following season Worsley won back the starting job for the Rangers, and Bower returned to the minor leagues. He played there for four more years with three teams, the Providence Reds, the Vancouver Canucks and the Cleveland Barons, and was called up briefly by the Rangers in and .

In the 1958 Inter-League draft he was claimed by the Toronto Maple Leafs, who were an up-and-coming team of young star players at the time. Nonetheless, Bower preferred to stay with the Barons, as he was tired of moving all over the country. Punch Imlach, whom the Maple Leafs had recently hired, visited Bower and convinced him to give the NHL one more try, as he considered him &quot;the most remarkable — and maybe the best — athlete in the world.&quot;

Bower won his first Vezina Trophy in 1961 for allowing the fewest goals in the 1960–61 season. The height of his NHL career came during the Maple Leafs&#x27; three consecutive Stanley Cup victories from 1962 to 1964. He later said, &quot;When we won the Stanley Cup, my head went numb, my whole body went numb. That was my dream from Day One. You just can&#x27;t explain the feelings inside you.&quot;

Bower&#x27;s career was hampered by poor eyesight, but he remained a top-tier goaltender. He was known for his hard-nosed, scrappy playing style and helped the Leafs win another Stanley Cup in 1967, as part of a tandem with another Hall of Famer, Terry Sawchuk. He said, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t all that glad to see the two-goalie system come in. I wanted to play as many games as I could.&quot; Bower and Sawchuk shared the Vezina Trophy in .

On April 6, 1969, at the age of 44 years, 4 months, and 29 days, Bower became the oldest goaltender to play in a Stanley Cup playoff game, a distinction previously held by Lester Patrick. He played his last game on December 10, 1969, a 6–3 loss to Montreal; mainly due to injuries, this was his only game of the 1969–70 season. At the time, he was the oldest full-time player to participate in an NHL game, and remains the second-oldest goaltender (45 years, 1 month, 2 days), behind only Maurice Roberts; he was surpassed as oldest full-time player by Gordie Howe, Chris Chelios, and Jaromír Jágr.

On March 19, 1970, Bower publicly announced his retirement, four months after his 45th birthday. He played eleven full seasons with the Leafs. When asked if he might reveal his true age, he replied &quot;If you don&#x27;t know by now, you never will&quot;. Coach Punch Imlach once told Bower, after seeing a purported birth certificate, &quot;If you were born in this day here that you&#x27;re telling me, you had to be overseas with the First Division, in 1939, when you were 13.&quot; Bower eventually revealed his birth date as November 8, 1924.

He remains the AHL career leader in wins with 359.

==Post-retirement and death==
Bower worked for the Maple Leafs after his retirement in various capacities, including as a scout and a goalie coach. He was assistant coach for the Leafs from 1976 to 1978. He retired in 1990 but continued to make public appearances on behalf of the organization for the rest of his life.

Bower was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1976, and to the AHL Hall of Fame as a member of its inaugural class in 2006. In 1998, he was ranked number 87 on &quot;The Hockey News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest NHL Players. He was inducted into the Etobicoke Sports Hall of Fame in 1994, and into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1999. He was married to Nancy and had a son, two daughters, eight grandchildren and six great-grandchildren, and resided in Mississauga, Ontario. After a city park near his house was renamed in his honour, he would routinely clean litter there, and feed the birds.

In January 2004, Bower was featured on a postage stamp. As part of the NHL All-Stars Collection, he was immortalized along with five other All-Stars. In 2005, the Royal Canadian Mint featured Bower on a non-circulating fifty-cent coin, as part of its four-coin Legends of the Toronto Maple Leafs coin set. In 2007, it was announced that Bower would receive a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

On October 7, 2010, Bower opened the first game of the regular season for the Toronto Maple Leafs at Air Canada Centre by walking out on an implied &quot;bridge over water&quot; with his goalie stick.

On May 24, 2014, Bower attended a street renaming ceremony in Weston in Toronto. Patika Avenue, where he lived during the 1960s, was renamed Johnny Bower Boulevard. He said, &quot;It’s a great day for me and my family...this is a better ovation than I used to get at Maple Leaf Gardens.&quot;

On September 6, 2014, the Maple Leafs named him and Darryl Sittler two of the first three inductees of Legends Row (Ted Kennedy had been inducted some months earlier), with statues outside Air Canada Centre of twelve of the greatest players in Maple Leafs history.

On December 26, 2017, Bower died at the age of 93 from pneumonia. In the days following Bower&#x27;s death, many teams, including the Maple Leafs, Winnipeg Jets, Arizona Coyotes and Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball Association honoured Bower with pre-game tributes. On January 3, the Maple Leafs hosted a public celebration of Bower&#x27;s life at the Air Canada Centre. The event was attended by thousands, including various NHL alumni, members of the current Maple Leafs team, members of the Canadian Armed Forces and other major figures. The memorial was televised across several channels in Canada, and in accordance with the event, Toronto Mayor John Tory declared January 3 to be Johnny Bower Day in the city of Toronto. For the remainder of the season, the Maple Leafs wore patches on their jerseys and helmets in honour of Bower.

==Legacy==
Bower was the first goaltender to employ the poke check, an aggressive move whereby the goalie uses his stick to poke the puck away from an attacking player, sometimes leaving his crease to do so. This move has since been imitated by goaltenders at all levels of hockey.

<text>Postojna (; , ) is a town in the traditional region of Inner Carniola, from Trieste, in southwestern Slovenia. It is the seat of the Municipality of Postojna. It includes the hamlet of Ravbarkomanda (sometimes also spelled &quot;Ravberkomanda&quot;, ) to the northeast.

==History==
The area is known to have been populated since the paleolithic era due to the discovery of a cave settlement near the town of Postojna called Betal Rock Shelter (). The town lies on the Pivka River. Written sources first mention the settlement in the 13th century and in 1432 it became a borough. It was proclaimed a town in 1909. 

From the late Middle Ages, it was part of the Duchy of Carniola and hence of the Habsburg monarchy. In the 19th century, it was part of the Inner Carniola &quot;Kreis&quot;. It was part of the Italy under the Treaty of Rapallo between 1918 and 1943 (nominally to 1947) and was part of the province of Trieste as Postumia.

===Mass grave===
At Postojna there is a mass grave associated with the Second World War. The Pine Shaft Mass Grave () is southeast of Postojna, between Little Trebevnik Hill () and Big Trebevnik Hill (). It is a steep sinkhole that contains the remains of unidentified victims.

== Climate ==

==Attractions==
One of Slovenia&#x27;s major tourist attractions, Postojna Cave, is located near the town.

==Church==
The parish church in the town is dedicated to Saint Stephen and belongs to the Koper Diocese. Within the urban area of Postojna, the church dedicated to the Prophet Daniel in the hamlet of Zalog and the chapel dedicated to Saint Lazarus at the town cemetery also belong to this parish.

<text>Beltinci (; Prekmurje Slovene: &quot;Böltinci&quot;, or &quot;Belatincz&quot;, ) is a town in the Prekmurje region of northeastern Slovenia. It is the seat of the Municipality of Beltinci. Črnec Creek, a tributary of the Ledava, flows through the settlement.

==Name==
Beltinci was attested as &quot;Belethfalua&quot; in 1322, &quot;Belethafalua&quot; in 1381, and &quot;Balatincz&quot; in 1402. The name is originally a plural demonym derived from the Slavic personal name &quot;*Běletinъ&quot;—from the nickname &quot;*Bělъ(jъ)&quot; &#x27;white&#x27;, applied to people with fair skin or hair—thus meaning &#x27;residents of Běletinъ&#x27;s village&#x27;. The second &quot;e&quot; in the reconstructed name &quot;*Beletinci&quot; was lost in Slovene due to syncope.

==Jewish community==
Until 1937, there was a Jewish Orthodox synagogue in Beltinci. It was built in 1860 and served the local Jewish community. On April 26, 1944, all of the Jews of the town were deported to the Auschwitz extermination camp, from which none of them returned.

==Church==
The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to Saint Ladislaus and belongs to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Murska Sobota. It dates from 1742 with late 19th-century alterations.

<text>Landing craft are small and medium seagoing watercraft, such as boats and barges, used to convey a landing force (infantry and vehicles) from the sea to the shore during an amphibious assault. The term excludes landing ships, which are larger. Production of landing craft peaked during World War II, with a significant number of different designs produced in large quantities by the United Kingdom and United States.

Because of the need to run up onto a suitable beach, World War II landing craft were flat-bottomed, and many designs had a flat front, often with a lowerable ramp, rather than a normal bow. This made them difficult to control and very uncomfortable in rough seas. The control point (too rudimentary to call a bridge on LCA and similar craft) was normally at the extreme rear of the vessel, as were the engines. In all cases, they were known by an abbreviation derived from the official name rather than by the full title.

==History==
In the days of sail, the ship&#x27;s boats were used as landing craft. These utility boats were sufficient, if inefficient, in an era when Marines were effectively light infantry, participating mostly in small-scale campaigns in far-flung colonies against less well-equipped indigenous opponents.

In order to support amphibious operations during the landing in Pisagua (1879) by carrying significant quantities of cargo, and landing troops directly onto an unimproved shore, the Government of Chile built flat-bottomed landing craft, called &quot;Chalanas&quot;. They transported 1,200 men in the first landing and took on board 600 men in less than 2 hours for the second landing.

===Origins===

During World War I, the mass mobilization of troops equipped with rapid-fire weapons quickly rendered such boats obsolete. Initial landings during the Gallipoli campaign took place in unmodified ship&#x27;s boats that were extremely vulnerable to attack from the Turkish shore defenses.
In February 1915, orders were placed for the design of purpose built landing craft. A design was created in four days resulting in an order for 200 &#x27;X&#x27; &quot;Lighters&quot; (or X-lighters) with a spoon-shaped bow to take shelving beaches and a drop down frontal ramp.

The first use took place after they had been towed to the Aegean and performed successfully in the 6 August landing at Suvla Bay of IX Corps, commanded by Commander Edward Unwin.

&#x27;X&#x27; &quot;Lighters&quot;, known to the soldiers as &#x27;Beetles&#x27;, carried about 500 men, displaced 200 tons (or 160 tons according to some sources) and were based on London barges being long, wide, and deep (). The engines mainly ran on heavy oil and ran at a maximal speed of approximately . The boats had bulletproof sides and a ramp at the bow for disembarkation.

Spain purchased 26–28 X-lighters. During the Rif War, they were used in the 1925 Alhucemas landing, arguably the first major amphibious landing in which tanks were disembarked in large numbers.
The Imperial Russian Navy soon followed suit, building at the Russud Shipyard in 1916 a series of similar landing motor barges of the so-called Bolinder class (a.k.a. the Russud class), named in Russia after the supplier of semi-diesel engines installed in them. These, however, proved too small and unseaworthy for their intended Black Sea theater, as they were intended for planned landings on the coast of the Marmara Sea and Turkish straits. Instead, a new ship class was designed, based on a widespread in Southern Russia merchant ship type of the era which were Azov–Black Sea steam schooners – so-called &quot;Elpidifors&quot; – commissioned into naval service during World War I and used as landing craft during the Trebizond Campaign, etc. These were typically very light at the bow, having all their machinery concentrated at the stern, which allowed easy beaching on any gently sloping coast, and often were equipped with bow gangways for fast unloading. This resulted in the 1,300-tonne, Elpidifor class, named after the Rostov-on-Don merchant Elpidifor Paramonov, whose eponymous &quot;Elpidifor&quot;-type grain carrier served as a pattern on which they were based. With a loaded mean draft, and equipped with the ballast tanks and reinforced hull for safe beaching, they were able to land 1,000 troops with their train at virtually any available beach. While the landings for which they were created never happened, the ship class themself turned out quite useful and ships of the class had a long career, supporting Wrangel&#x27;s Army landings in Kuban and in Northern Taurida during the Russian Civil War, and later were used by the Russian SFSR and Soviet Union as minesweepers, minelayers, gunboats and merchant ships.

A plan was devised to land British heavy tanks from pontoons in support of the Third Battle of Ypres, but this was abandoned.
During the inter-war period, the combination of the negative experience at Gallipoli and economic stringency contributed to the delay in procuring equipment and adopting a universal doctrine for amphibious operations in the Royal Navy.

Despite this outlook, the British produced the Motor Landing Craft in 1920, based on their experience with the early &#x27;Beetle&#x27; armoured transport. The craft could put a medium tank directly onto a beach. From 1924, it was used with landing boats in annual exercises in amphibious landings. A prototype motor landing craft, designed by J. Samuel White of Cowes, was built and first sailed in 1926. It weighed 16 tons and had a box-like appearance, having a square bow and stern. To prevent fouling of the propellers in a craft destined to spend time in surf and possibly be beached, a crude waterjet propulsion system was devised by White&#x27;s designers. A Hotchkiss petrol engine drove a centrifugal pump which produced a jet of water, pushing the craft ahead or astern, and steering it, according to how the jet was directed. Speed was 5–6 knots and its beaching capacity was good. By 1930, three MLC were operated by the Royal Navy.

The United States revived and experimented in their approach to amphibious warfare between 1913 and mid-1930s, when the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps became interested in setting up advanced bases in opposing countries during wartime; the prototype advanced base force officially evolved into the Fleet Marine Force (FMF) in 1933.

In 1939, during the annual Fleet Landing Exercises, the FMF became interested in the military potential of Andrew Higgins&#x27;s design of a powered, shallow-draught boat. These LCPL, dubbed the &#x27;Higgins Boats&#x27;, were reviewed and passed by the U.S. Naval Bureau of Construction and Repair. Soon, the Higgins boats were developed to a final design with a rampthe LCVP, and were produced in large numbers. The boat was a more flexible variant of the LCPR with a wider ramp. It could carry 36 troops, a small vehicle such as a jeep, or a corresponding amount of cargo.

==Second World War==

In the run-up to WWII, many specialized landing craft, both for infantry and vehicles, were developed. At the start of World War II, the Japanese led the world in landing craft design.

===Specialized infantry landing craft===

The Daihatsu-class landing craft was lowered to disembark cargo upon riding up onto a beach. After reviewing photos of a Daihatsu landing craft, this was adopted by American landing craft designer Andrew Higgins in developing the Landing Craft, Personnel (Large) (LCP(L)) into the Landing Craft, Personnel (Ramped) (LCP(R)) and later the Landing Craft, Vehicle and Personnel (LCVP). However, the Daihatsu landing craft was more seaworthy than an LCVP due to its hull design. It was constructed of a metal hull and powered by a diesel engine. 

Victor Harold Krulak, a native of Denver, who joined the Marines after graduating from Annapolis in 1934, witnessed the Japanese use small vessels like the &quot;Daihatsu-class&quot;. In 1937, as a lieutenant in an intelligence outfit during the 1937 Battle of Shanghai, when the Japanese were trying to conquer China, he used a telephoto lens to take pictures of Japanese landing craft with a square bow that became a retractable ramp. Krulak noted that the boats&#x27; droppable ramps enabled troops to quickly disembark from the bow, rather than having to clamber over the sides and splash into the surf. Envisioning those ramps as answering the Marines&#x27; needs in a looming world war, Lieutenant Krulak showed the photographs to his superiors, who passed on his report to Washington. But two years later, he found that the Navy had simply filed it away with a notation saying it was the work of “some nut out in China.” He persevered, building a balsa wood model of the Japanese boat design and discussing the retractable ramp concept with the New Orleans boat builder Andrew Higgins. That bow design became the basis for the thousands of Higgins landing craft of World War II. As according to Victor H. Krulak &quot;the Japanese were light years ahead of us in landing craft design&quot;.

In November 1938, the British Inter-Service Training and Development Centre proposed a new type of landing craft. Its specifications were to weigh less than ten long tons, to be able to carry the thirty-one men of a British Army platoon and five assault engineers or signallers, and to be so shallow drafted as to be able to land them, wet only up to their knees, in eighteen inches of water. All of these specifications made the Landing Craft Assault; a separate set of requirements were laid down for a vehicle and supplies carrier, although previously the two roles had been combined in the Motor Landing Craft.

J. S. White of Cowes built a prototype to the Fleming design. Eight weeks later the craft was doing trials on the River Clyde. All landing craft designs must find a compromise between two divergent priorities; the qualities that make a good sea boat are opposite to those that make a craft suitable for beaching. The craft had a hull built of double-diagonal mahogany planking. The sides were plated with &quot;10lb. DHT&quot; armour, a heat treated steel based on D1 steel, in this case Hadfield&#x27;s Resista .

The Landing Craft Assault remained the most common British and Commonwealth landing craft of World War II, and the humblest vessel admitted to the books of the Royal Navy on D-Day. Prior to July 1942, these craft were referred to as &quot;Assault Landing Craft&quot; (ALC), but &quot;Landing Craft; Assault&quot; (LCA) was used thereafter to conform with the joint US-UK nomenclature system.

The Landing Craft Infantry was a stepped up amphibious assault ship, developed in response to a British request for a vessel capable of carrying and landing substantially more troops than the smaller Landing Craft Assault (LCA). The result was a small steel ship that could land 200 troops, traveling from rear bases on its own bottom at a speed of up to . The original British design was envisioned as being a &quot;one time use&quot; vessel which would simply ferry the troops across the English Channel, and were considered an expendable vessel. As such, no troop sleeping accommodations were placed in the original design. This was changed shortly after initial use of these ships, when it was discovered that many missions would require overnight accommodations.

The first LCI(L)s entered service in 1943 chiefly with the Royal Navy (RN) and United States Navy. Some 923 LCI were built in ten American shipyards and 211 provided under lend-lease to the Royal Navy.

===Specialized vehicle landing craft===
Following the Inter-Service Training and Development Centre &#x27;s (ISTDC) successful development of the infantry carrying LCA, attention turned to the means of efficiently delivering a tank to a beach in 1938. Enquiries were made of the army as to the heaviest tank that might be employed in a landing operation. The army wanted to be able to land a 12-ton tank, but the ISTDC, anticipating weight increases in future tank models specified 16 tons burthen for Mechanised Landing Craft designs. Another limit on any design was the need to land tanks and other vehicles in less than approximately .

Design work began at John I. Thornycroft Ltd. in May 1938 with trials completing in February 1940. Constructed of steel and selectively clad with armour plate, this shallow-draft, barge-like boat with a crew of 6, could ferry a tank of 16 long tons to shore at 7 knots (13 km/h). Depending on the weight of the tank to be transported the craft might be lowered into the water by its davits already loaded or could have the tank placed in it after being lowered into the water.

Although the Royal Navy had the Landing Craft Mechanised at its disposal, in 1940 Prime Minister Winston Churchill demanded an amphibious vessel capable of landing at least three 36-ton heavy tanks directly onto a beach, able to sustain itself at sea for at least a week, and inexpensive and easy to build. Admiral Maund, Director of the Inter-Service Training and Development Centre (which had developed the Landing Craft Assault), gave the job to naval architect Sir Roland Baker, who within three days completed initial drawings for a landing craft with a beam and a shallow draft. Ship builders Fairfields and John Brown agreed to work out details for the design under the guidance of the Admiralty Experimental Works at Haslar. Tank tests with models soon determined the characteristics of the craft, indicating that it would make on engines delivering about . Designated the LCT Mark 1, 20 were ordered in July 1940 and a further 10 in October 1940.

The first LCT Mark 1 was launched by Hawthorn Leslie in November 1940. It was an all-welded 372-ton steel-hulled vessel that drew only of water at the bow. Sea trials soon proved the Mark 1 to be difficult to handle and almost unmanageable in some sea conditions. The designers set about correcting the faults of the Mark 1 in the LCT Mark 2. It was longer and wider, with armoured shielding added to the wheelhouse and gun tubs.

The Mark 3 had an additional midsection that gave it a length of and a displacement of 640 tons. Even with this extra weight, the vessel was slightly faster than the Mark 1. The Mk.3 was accepted on 8 April 1941. The Mark 4 was slightly shorter and lighter than the Mk.3, but had a much wider beam () and was intended for cross channel operations as opposed to seagoing use. When tested in early assault operations, like the ill-fated Allied raid on Dieppe in 1942, the lack of manoeuvring ability led to the preference for a shorter overall length in future variants, most of which were built in the United States.

When the United States entered the war in December 1941, the U.S. Navy had no amphibious vessels at all, and found itself obliged to consider British designs already in existence. One of these, advanced by K.C. Barnaby of Thornycroft, was for a double-ended LCT to work with landing ships. The Bureau of Ships quickly set about drawing up plans for landing craft based on Barnaby&#x27;s suggestions, although with only one ramp. The result, in early 1942, was the LCT Mark 5, a craft that could accommodate five 30-ton or four 40-ton tanks or 150 tons of cargo. This 286-ton landing craft could be shipped to combat areas in three separate water-tight sections aboard a cargo ship or carried pre-assembled on the flat deck of a Landing Ship, Tank (LST). The Mk.5 would be launched by heeling the LST on its beam to let the craft slide off its chocks into the sea, or cargo ships could lower each of the three sections into the sea where they were joined together.

===Development of Landing Ships===
Due to their small size, most amphibious ships and craft were not given names and were just given serial numbers, e.g., &quot;LCT 304&quot;. The LSTs and LSDs were an exception to this, since they were similar in size to a small cruiser. In addition, three British-built LSTs were named: , and ; these were all larger than the U.S. design and had proper funnels.

====Landing Ship, Tank====

A further development was the Landing Ship, Tank designation, built to support amphibious operations by carrying significant quantities of vehicles, cargo, and landing troops directly onto an unimproved shore. The British evacuation from Dunkirk in 1940 demonstrated to the Admiralty that the Allies needed relatively large, ocean-going ships capable of shore-to-shore delivery of tanks and other vehicles in amphibious assaults upon the continent of Europe. The first purpose-built LST design was . To carry 13 Churchill infantry tanks, 27 vehicles and nearly 200 men (in addition to the crew) at a speed of 18 knots, it could not have the shallow draught that would have made for easy unloading. As a result, each of the three (&quot;Boxer&quot;, &quot;Bruiser&quot;, and &quot;Thruster&quot;) ordered in March 1941 had a very long ramp stowed behind the bow doors.

In November 1941, a small delegation from the British Admiralty arrived in the United States to pool ideas with the United States Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Ships with regard to development of ships and also including the possibility of building further &quot;Boxer&quot;s in the US. During this meeting, it was decided that the Bureau of Ships would design these vessels. The LST(2) design incorporated elements of the first British LCTs from their designer, Sir Rowland Baker, who was part of the British delegation. This included sufficient buoyancy in the ships&#x27; sidewalls that they would float even with the tank deck flooded. The LST(2) gave up the speed of HMS &quot;Boxer&quot; at only 10 knots but had a similar load while drawing only 3 feet forward when beaching.

Congress provided the authority for the construction of LSTs along with a host of other auxiliaries, destroyer escorts, and assorted landing craft. The enormous building program quickly gathered momentum. Such a high priority was assigned to the construction of LSTs that the previously laid keel of an aircraft carrier was hastily removed to make room for several LSTs to be built in her place. The keel of the first LST was laid down on 10 June 1942 at Newport News, Va., and the first standardized LSTs were floated out of their building dock in October. Twenty-three were in commission by the end of 1942. Lightly armored, they could steam cross the ocean with a full load on their own power, carrying infantry, tanks and supplies directly onto the beaches. Together with 2,000 other landing craft, the LSTs gave the troops a protected, quick way to make combat landings, beginning in summer 1943.

====Landing Ship, Dock====
The &quot;&quot;Landing Ship Dock&quot;&quot; (LSD) came as a result of a British requirement for a vessel that could carry large landing craft across the seas at speed. The first LSD came from a design by Sir Roland Baker and was an answer to the problem of launching small craft rapidly. The &quot;Landing Ship Stern Chute&quot;, which was a converted train ferry, was an early attempt. Thirteen Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM) could be launched from these ships down the chute. The Landing Ship Gantry was a converted tanker with a crane to transfer its cargo of landing craft from deck to sea—15 LCMs in a little over half an hour.

The design was developed and built in the US for the USN and the Royal Navy. The LSD could carry 36 LCM at 16 knots. It had a large open compartment at the back. Opening a stern door and flooding special compartments opened this area to the sea so that LCI-sized vessels could enter or leave. It took one and a half hours for the dock to be flooded down and two and half to pump it out. When flooded they could also be used as docks for repairs to small craft.

===Other===
====Landing Craft Navigation (LCN)====
Nine-ton &quot;Landing Craft Navigation (LCN)&quot; were used by British &quot;Combined Operations Assault Pilotage Parties&quot; (Royal Marine and Special Boat Service crew) for surveying landing sites.

====Landing Craft Control (LCC)====
The &quot;Landing Craft Control (LCC)&quot; were U.S. Navy vessels, carrying only the crew (Scouts and Raiders) and newly developed radar. Their main job was to find and follow the safe routes in to the beach, which were lanes that had been cleared of obstacles and mines. There were eight in the entire Normandy invasion (two per beach). After leading in the first wave, they were to head back out and bring in the second wave. After that, they were used as all-purpose command and control assets during the invasion.

====Amphibious vehicles====
Very small landing craft, or amphibians, were designed. The U.S.-designed &quot;Landing Vehicle Tracked&quot;, was an amphibious (and sometimes armored) personnel carrier. These were operated by Army personnel, not naval crews and had a capacity of about three tons. The British introduced their own amphibian, the &quot;Terrapin&quot;.

===Fire support craft===
It was soon realized that battleships, cruisers and destroyers could not necessarily provide all the fire support (including suppressive fire) that an amphibious assault might need. Therefore, specialized vessels were developed that incorporated various direct and indirect fire weapons. These included guns and rockets which could be mounted on landing craft and landing ships. As part of the final barrage before an assault, the landing area would be plastered by these types.

Amphibious landing craft of WWII were generally fitted out with minimal weaponry. LCA crews were issued with .303 inch Lewis Guns, which were mounted in a light machine gun shelter on the forward-port side of the craft; these could be used both as anti-aircraft protection and against shore targets. Later models were fitted with two 2-inch mortars, and two Lewis or .303 Bren light machine guns. LCM 1 crews were issued with Lewis guns, and many LCM 3s had .50 in (12.7 mm) Browning machine guns mounted for anti-aircraft protection. Opportunities for troops on board to use their own weapons presented themselves.

LCIs and LCTs carried heavier weapons, such as the Oerlikon 20 mm cannon, on each side of the bridge structure. LSTs had a somewhat heavier armament.

Some landing craft were converted for special purposes either to provide defence for the other landing craft in the attack or as support weapons during the landing.

====Landing Craft Assault (Hedgerow)====
The LCA(HR) was a converted British LCA. It carried a battery of 24 spigot mortars, the Royal Navy&#x27;s Hedgehog anti-submarine weapon, instead of personnel. The mortars were fired as a barrage onto the beach to clear mines and other obstructions. Having discharged its mortars and its duty, the LCA(HR) would leave the beach area. They were towed to the beach by larger craft, such as the LCTs that carried the Royal Engineer assault teams with their specialist vehicles and equipment, who would complete the beach clearance.

Three flotillas (of 18, 18 and 9 craft) were used at Juno, Gold and Sword beaches.

====Landing Craft Flak====

The Landing Craft Flak (LCF) was a conversion of the LCT that was intended to give anti-aircraft support to the landing. They were first used in the Dieppe Raid early in 1942. The ramp was welded shut, and a deck built on top of the Tank deck. They were equipped with several light anti-aircraft guns—a typical fitting was eight 20 mm Oerlikons and four QF 2 pdr &quot;pom-poms&quot; and had a crew of 60. On British examples, the operation of the craft was the responsibility of RN crew and the guns were manned by Royal Marines. They carried two naval officers and two marine officers.

====Landing Craft Gun====
The Landing Craft Gun (LCG) was another LCT conversion intended to give supporting fire to the landing. Apart from the Oerlikon armament of a normal LCT, each LCG(Medium) had two British Army 25 pounder gun-howitzers in armoured mountings, while LCG(L)3 and LCG(L)4 both had two 4.7-inch naval guns (). Crewing was similar to the LCF. LCGs played a very important part in the Walcheren operations in October 1944.

====Landing Craft Rocket====
The Landing Craft Tank (Rocket), LCT(R), was an LCT modified to carry a large set of launchers for the British RP-3 &quot;60 lb&quot; rockets mounted on the covered-over tank deck. The full set of launchers was &quot;in excess of&quot; 1,000 and 5,000 reloads were kept below. The firepower was claimed to be equivalent to 80 light cruisers or 200 destroyers.

The method of operation was to anchor off the target beach, pointing towards the shore. The distance to the shore was then measured by radar and the elevation of the launchers set accordingly. The crew then vanished below (apart from the commanding officer who retreated to a special cubby hole to control things) and the launch was then set off electrically. The launch could comprise the entire set or individual ranks of rockets.

A full reload was a very labor-intensive operation and at least one LCT(R) went alongside a cruiser and got a working party from the larger ship to assist in the process.

====Landing Craft Support====

The Landing Craft Support was used to give some firepower close in.

The Landing Craft Support (Medium) (LCS(M)), Mark 2 and Mark 3 were used by the British forces at Normandy. The crew was Royal Navy, with Royal Marines to operate the weapons: two 0.5 inch Vickers machine guns and a 4-inch mortar to fire smoke shells.

The Fairmile H Landing Craft Support (Large) had armour added to its wooden hull and a turret with an anti-tank gun fitted. The LCS(L) Mark 1 had a Daimler armoured car turret with its QF 2–pdr (40 mm) gun. The Mark 2 had a QF 6–pdr (57 mm) anti–tank gun.

The American Landing Craft Support was larger, each was armed with a 3-inch gun (), various smaller guns, and ten MK7 rocket launchers.

===Inflatable landing craft===
Inflatable boats were often used to transport amphibious troops from high speed transports and submarines. The United States used a 7-man Landing Craft, Rubber (Small) (LCR-S) and a 10-man Landing Craft, Rubber (Large) (LCR-L).

The first and last instances of the large use of rubber boats in amphibious operations in World War II were the Makin Island raid in 1942 and the landing of the 1st Battalion 6th Marines Battle of Tarawa in 1943 where the Battalion commander Major William K. Jones was nicknamed &quot;Admiral of the Condom Fleet&quot;.

===Landing Craft Group and wartime training===

After Pearl Harbor, the U.S. Army and Navy began intense planning for the transport of millions of men into combat and the training for amphibious operations. By June 1942, Amphibious Force, Atlantic Fleet (AFAF) established headquarters at Norfolk (Virginia) under the command of Admiral Henry Kent Hewitt. Temporary headquarters for a transport command were set up in an old American Export Line transport ship that had been built for the Army in World War I. Within the transport command, a Landing Craft Group was created to prepare the crews of landing ships.

&quot;The training of landing craft crews under the direction of Captain W.P.O. Clarke began at the end of June 1942,&quot; according to Naval historian Samuel Eliot Morison. Clarke was given orders to &quot;secure, organize, and train crews for approximately 1,800 landing craft&quot; including LSTs and LCIs, which at that time were still in the design phase.

To man and support such landing craft, the Navy ordered that 30,000 men and 3,000 officers be trained in a matter of months, but initially the Landing Craft Group consisted only of Capt. Clarke, two officers and a yeoman. In creating training programs, Clarke studied blueprints for the new craft and &quot;from these paper drawings he prepared ship&#x27;s organizations for each type. This was the first textbook for crews assigned to the large landing craft. From this, they were to be trained in what their duties were to be, what the ship would be like, and how it would be expected to operate.&quot;

In August 1942, Capt. Clarke was told about Operation Torch and secret plans to invade North Africa the following November. He had only a few months to train thousands of men, most of whom were just out of indoctrination school. &quot;They were the butchers, the bakers, and the light bulb makers of American youth. War was new to them, and organized Navy life was strange,&quot; observed Lt. Eric Burton, a Naval officer who wrote &quot;By Sea and by Land&quot;, a semi-official account published during the War about amphibious combat.

Capt. Clarke created hydrographic, maintenance, medical, and communications training programs, and a section to train Army shore parties how to unload landing craft. He set up a training facility at Solomons Island, and held exercises on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay around the clock, day and night.

On 1 September 1942, the Amphibious Force and its Landing Craft Group rented the Nansemond Hotel, a popular resort hotel on Virginia Beach near Norfolk, to use as a headquarters building. Eventually, 40 major amphibious operations would be planned at the old hotel. For several weeks, Gen. George S. Patton worked on plans for the invasion of North Africa out of the Nansemond.

&quot;Captain Clarke had less than two months, about one-third of what had been considered the minimum, to train these men to conduct night ship-to-shore landings,&quot; wrote Samuel Eliot Morison about the preparations for Operation Torch. &quot;Considering the time limitations, his performance was remarkable.&quot; Clarke was awarded the Legion of Merit for the accomplishment. According to the Presidential citation, he and the Landing Craft Group &quot;brought these ships and craft to a high state of readiness for combat operations in all subsequent major amphibious operations in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Mediterranean theatres.

==Early Cold War developments==
===Landing Craft Utility (LCU)===
A &quot;Landing Craft Utility&quot; (LCU) was used to transport equipment and troops to the shore. It was capable of transporting tracked or wheeled vehicles and troops from amphibious assault ships to beachheads or piers. It was the direct successor of the LCT, and surviving U.S. LCTs from WW2 were redesignated LCMs.

===Helicopters===
Despite all the progress that was seen during World War II, there were still fundamental limitations in the types of coastline that were suitable for assault. Beaches had to be relatively free of obstacles, and have the right tidal conditions and the correct slope. The development of the helicopter fundamentally changed the equation.

The first use of helicopters in an amphibious assault came during the Anglo-French-Israeli invasion of Egypt in 1956 (the Suez War). Two British light fleet carriers were pressed into service to carry helicopters, and a battalion-sized airborne assault was made. Two of the other carriers involved, and , were converted in the late 1950s into dedicated &quot;commando carriers&quot;.

The US Navy built five landing platform helicopter vessels in the 1950s and 1960s, and various converted fleet and escort carriers for the purpose of providing a helicopter amphibious assault capability. The first of the type envisaged was the escort carrier , which never actually saw service as an amphibious assault ship. Delays in the construction of the &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; class saw other conversions made as a stopgap measure; three s (, , and ) and one () were converted into &quot;Boxer&quot; and &quot;Thetis Bay&quot; class amphibious assault vessels. Helicopter amphibious assault techniques were developed further by American forces in the Vietnam War and refined during training exercises.

==Current landing craft==
===Amphibious mechanized utility and landing craft===
Mechanized utility and landing craft were the kind used during the second world war and, while the mechanized landing craft of today are similar in construction, many improvements have been made. For example, landing craft (such as the LCM-8 of the US Navy) are capable of a military lift of at a speed of , carrying even heavy equipment, such as M1 Abrams tanks. Landing craft can mount several machine guns or similar weapons for the defense of troops and/or vehicle crews inside.

===Air-cushioned landing craft===

The air-cushioned landing craft (Landing Craft Air Cushion, or LCAC in the US Navy) is based on small to mid-sized multi-purpose hovercraft, Also known as &quot;over the beach&quot; (&quot;OTB&quot;) craft, they allow troops and material to access more than 70 percent of the world&#x27;s coastline, while only approximately 15 percent of that coastline is available to conventional landing craft. Like the mechanized landing craft, they are usually equipped with mounted machine guns, although they also support grenade launchers and heavy weapons. These vehicles are commonly used in the United States Navy, the Royal Navy, the Russian Navy, and the Hellenic Navy.

==Landing barges==

Landing barges were adaptations of British Thames barges and lighters as landing craft. In size, they came between the landing craft and landing ships. They were used at all beaches during the landings at Normandy and were manned by British crews.

Some were fitted with engines, while others were towed to the beach. They were used for defence, transportation, supply (food, water and oil) and repair (fitted out with workshops).

Those fitted for vehicle carrying had a ramp fitted in place at the rear and they had to back onto beaches. They would work from ships and coasters to the shore and back.

Two flotillas were made up of &quot;flak barges&quot; to provide defence of the beaches. Like landing craft, flak barges carried A/A guns: two 40 mm Bofors and two 20 mm Oerlikon, with army gunners and naval crew.

The Landing Barge, Kitchen (LBK) was fitted with a large superstructure containing the galley. With a crew of 20 plus, they could carry food for 800 for a week and provide 1,600 hot and 800 cold meals a day, including freshly baked bread.

<text>Capability-based security is a concept in the design of secure computing systems, one of the existing security models. A capability (known in some systems as a key) is a communicable, unforgeable token of authority. It refers to a value that references an object along with an associated set of access rights. A user program on a capability-based operating system must use a capability to access an object. Capability-based security refers to the principle of designing user programs such that they directly share capabilities with each other according to the principle of least privilege, and to the operating system infrastructure necessary to make such transactions efficient and secure. Capability-based security is to be contrasted with an approach that uses traditional UNIX permissions and access control lists.

Although most operating systems implement a facility which resembles capabilities, they typically do not provide enough support to allow for the exchange of capabilities among possibly mutually untrusting entities to be the primary means of granting and distributing access rights throughout the system. A capability-based system, in contrast, is designed with that goal in mind.

==Introduction==
Capabilities achieve their objective of improving system security by being used in place of forgeable references. A forgeable reference (for example, a path name) identifies an object, but does not specify which access rights are appropriate for that object and the user program which holds that reference. Consequently, any attempt to access the referenced object must be validated by the operating system, based on the ambient authority of the requesting program, typically via the use of an access-control list (ACL). Instead, in a system with capabilities, the mere fact that a user program possesses that capability entitles it to use the referenced object in accordance with the rights that are specified by that capability. In theory, a system with capabilities removes the need for any access control list or similar mechanism by giving all entities all and only the capabilities they will actually need.

A capability is typically implemented as a privileged data structure that consists of a section that specifies access rights, and a section that uniquely identifies the object to be accessed. The user does not access the data structure or object directly, but instead via a handle. In practice, it is used much like a file descriptor in a traditional operating system (a traditional handle), but to access every object on the system. Capabilities are typically stored by the operating system in a list, with some mechanism in place to prevent the program from directly modifying the contents of the capability (so as to forge access rights or change the object it points to). Some systems have also been based on capability-based addressing (hardware support for capabilities), such as Plessey System 250.

Programs possessing capabilities can perform functions on them, such as passing them on to other programs, converting them to a less-privileged version, or deleting them. The operating system must ensure that only specific operations can occur to the capabilities in the system, in order to maintain the integrity of the security policy.

Capabilities as discussed in this article should not be confused with Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) 1e/2c &quot;Capabilities&quot;. The latter are coarse-grained privileges that cannot be transferred between processes.

==Examples==
A capability is defined to be a protected object reference which, by virtue of its possession by a user process, grants that process the capability (hence the name) to interact with an object in certain ways. Those ways might include reading data associated with an object, modifying the object, executing the data in the object as a process, and other conceivable access rights. The capability logically consists of a reference that uniquely identifies a particular object and a set of one or more of these rights.

Suppose that, in a user process&#x27;s memory space, there exists the following string:

 /etc/passwd

Although this identifies a unique object on the system, it does not specify access rights and hence is not a capability. Suppose there is instead the following pair of values:

 /etc/passwd
 O_RDWR

This pair identifies an object along with a set of access rights. The pair, however, is still not a capability because the user process&#x27;s &quot;possession&quot; of these values says nothing about whether that access would actually be legitimate.

Now suppose that the user program successfully executes the following statement:
int fd = open(&quot;/etc/passwd&quot;, O_RDWR);

The variable codice_1 now contains the index of a file descriptor in the process&#x27;s file descriptor table. This file descriptor &quot;is&quot; a capability. Its existence in the process&#x27;s file descriptor table is sufficient to show that the process does indeed have legitimate access to the object. A key feature of this arrangement is that the file descriptor table is in kernel memory and cannot be directly manipulated by the user program.

==Sharing between processes==
In traditional operating systems, programs often communicate with each other and with storage using references like those in the first two examples. Path names are often passed as command-line parameters, sent via sockets, and stored on disk. These references are not capabilities, and must be validated before they can be used. In these systems, a central question is &quot;on whose &quot;authority&quot; is a given reference to be evaluated?&quot; This becomes a critical issue especially for processes which must act on behalf of two different authority-bearing entities. They become susceptible to a programming error known as the confused deputy problem, very frequently resulting in a security hole.

In a capability-based system, the capabilities themselves are passed between processes and storage using a mechanism that is known by the operating system to maintain the integrity of those capabilities.

One novel approach to solving this problem involves the use of an orthogonally persistent operating system. In such a system, there is no need for entities to be discarded and their capabilities be invalidated, and hence require an ACL-like mechanism to restore those capabilities at a later time. The operating system maintains the integrity and security of the capabilities contained within all storage, both volatile and nonvolatile, at all times; in part by performing all serialization tasks by itself, rather than requiring user programs to do so, as is the case in most operating systems. Because user programs are relieved of this responsibility, there is no need to trust them to reproduce only legal capabilities, nor to validate requests for access using an access control mechanism. An example implementation is the Flex machine from the early 1980s.

==POSIX capabilities==
Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) draft 1003.1e specifies a concept of permissions called &quot;capabilities&quot;. However, POSIX capabilities differ from capabilities in this article. A POSIX capability is not associated with any object; a process having CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE capability can listen on any TCP port under 1024. This system is found in Linux.

In contrast, Capsicum Unix hybridizes a true capability-system model with a Unix design and POSIX API. Capsicum capabilities are a refined form of file descriptor, a delegable right between processes and additional object types beyond classic POSIX, such as processes, can be referenced via capabilities. In Capsicum capability mode, processes are unable to utilize global namespaces (such as the filesystem namespace) to look up objects, and must instead inherit or be delegated them. This system is found natively in FreeBSD, but patches are available to other systems.

<text>Josip Hrvoje Peruzović (October 14, 1947 – July 29, 2018), better known by his ring name Nikolai Volkoff, was a Croatian-American professional wrestler from Yugoslavia, best known for his time in the World Wrestling Federation where he usually played a Soviet heel.

In the 1970s, Peruzović was Bepo of the Mongols tag team, one of the masked Executioners and feuded with Bruno Sammartino over the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship as Volkoff. In the 1980s, he tag teamed with the Iron Sheik and won the WWF Tag Team Championship at the inaugural WrestleMania event, and then with Boris Zhukov as The Bolsheviks.

In 1990, Volkoff turned face and defected to America, briefly feuding with Zhukov and newly-heel Iraqi sympathizer Sgt. Slaughter. In 1994, after a hiatus, he returned as a destitute and desperate character, exploited by Ted DiBiase as the first member of his Million Dollar Corporation. He continued to wrestle in various promotions until his death in 2018.

==Early life==
Peruzović grew up in the Socialist Republic of Croatia, which was then part of Yugoslavia. His parents were Ivan and Dragica (née Tomašević). His brother is Croatian footballer Luka Peruzović. Despite what he sometimes claimed, his actual middle name was not Nikolai but Hrvoje, and his mother&#x27;s maiden name was not Volkoff but Tomašević. These inconsistencies cast doubt on his ethnic background and seem to indicate a Croat ethnicity. His maternal grandfather Ante Tomašević was world champion in the Greco-Roman wrestling style at the turn of the 20th century. Ante was born in Cetina, a small village near Sinj, Croatia to Croatian parents Stipe and Katerina in 1872.

Peruzović was on the Yugoslavian weightlifting team until 1967, when he emigrated to Canada after a weightlifting tournament in Vienna, Austria. He received training in Calgary from Stu Hart, followed by his arrival in the United States in 1970. A fellow Croatian-native played the first Soviet Volkoff character in American pro-wrestling. Steve Gobb, born Gobrokovich, wrestled as USSR&#x27;s Nicoli Volkoff in the 1960s before the character was picked up by Josip.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early years (1967–1970)===
While trying his luck as a wrestler in Calgary, Alberta, in 1967, he met wrestler Newton Tattrie, who was wrestling for Stu Hart&#x27;s Stampede Wrestling. During his 1963–1968 tour, Tattrie took Peruzovic under his wing as a protégé and trained the non-English speaking, 315-pound man to become a professional wrestler and tag team partner. When Tattrie left the territory in 1968 for the US, Peruzovic left with him, working in various territories for the National Wrestling Alliance including NWA Detroit, the International Wrestling Association and the National Wrestling Federation where they won tag gold.

===World Wide Wrestling Federation (1970–1971)===

In 1970 he began wrestling in Vince McMahon Sr.&#x27;s World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) (currently known as WWE). Wrestling as &quot;Bepo Mongol&quot;, managed by &quot;Captain&quot; Lou Albano and partnered with Newton Tattrie (as Geeto Mongol) as the Mongols, he captured the WWF International Tag Team Championship from Tony Marino and Victor Rivera on June 15, 1970. After losing the title to Luke Graham and Tarzan Tyler in a match over a year later that unified the WWWF International and WWWF World Tag Team Championship, Peruzovic left the WWWF and went on to singles competition under the name &quot;Nikolai Volkoff&quot;.

===Return to the WWWF (1974–1980)===
In 1974, Volkoff returned to the company and appeared in a memorable match at a sold out Madison Square Garden and wrestled one of the sport&#x27;s most famous champions, Bruno Sammartino. In 1976, he was masked as an Executioner as he became the third member along with Killer Kowalski and Big John Studd. They captured the World Tag Team Championship, but it was vacated due to a third member interfering. Later he reverted to the Volkoff name. During this time in the WWWF, Volkoff was announced as being from Mongolia. He had a very successful feud with Bruno Sammartino, which started when Volkoff attacked him during an interview segment. They sold-out arenas throughout the Northeast. During this tenure, he began crushing fresh apples with one hand as a sign of what he would do to his opponents. He later had a feud with Bob Backlund during Backlund&#x27;s tenure as champion.

===American Wrestling Association; Mid-South; and Japan (1972–1984, 1989)===
Late in 1974, Volkoff moved to the AWA where he wrestled under the name &quot;Boris Breznikoff&quot;, managed by Bobby &quot;The Brain&quot; Heenan, he used the same gimmick with a different ring name. From 1977 to 1983 he wrestled in Japan for New Japan Pro-Wrestling and All Japan Pro Wrestling. In 1983, Volkoff wrestled for &quot;Cowboy&quot; Bill Watts in the Mid-South region. On October 29, 1989, he returned to AWA for a one night appearance as he lost to Ken Patera.

===Second return to the WWF (1984–1990, 1992)===
==== Teaming with the Iron Sheik (1984–1987) ====
In July 1984, Volkoff returned to the renamed WWF defeating S. D. Jones on Georgia Championship Wrestling and teamed with the Iron Sheik with the pair being managed by the &quot;Hollywood fashion plate&quot; &quot;Classy&quot; Freddie Blassie. It was at this point that Volkoff began to sing the national anthem of the Soviet Union before every match after which the Sheik would grab the microphone and proclaim &quot;Iran number one, Russia number one&quot; before exaggeratedly spitting after saying &quot;USA&quot;, in order to gain even more heat for being foreign heels. The new team of Volkoff and the Iron Sheik captured the WWF Tag Team Championship from the U.S. Express (Mike Rotundo and Barry Windham) at the first WrestleMania, on March 31, 1985, after the Sheik had knocked out Windham with Fred Blassie&#x27;s cane. After losing the title back to Rotundo and Windham three months later, Volkoff began to wrestle more in singles competition. He faced Hulk Hogan for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship on several occasions in 1985 and 1986 (including a flag match on &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event II&quot; at the Brendan Byrne Arena).

Volkoff also feuded with former 82nd Airborne paratrooper Corporal Kirchner throughout 1985 and 1986, defeating him in a &quot;peace match&quot; on &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event IV&quot;. Their feud ended when Kirchner used Blassie&#x27;s cane to defeat Volkoff at WrestleMania 2 in another flag match during the Chicago portion of the event. In the fall of 1986, Volkoff&#x27;s manager &quot;Classy&quot; Freddy Blassie sold half interest in his stable of superstars to the &quot;Doctor of Style&quot;, Slick (kayfabe), giving Slick co-managerial rights to Volkoff. Blassie also shared the contracts of the Iron Sheik and Hercules. This was a storyline aimed at reducing the aging Blassie&#x27;s active role, and the &quot;Hollywood fashion plate&quot; eventually retired in the fall of 1986 at the age of 68. Sheik and Volkoff feuded with WWF newcomer Jim Duggan for the majority of 1987, including Duggan running to the ring and stopping the Russian&#x27;s singing before their match against the Killer Bees at WrestleMania III (Sheik and Volkoff won by disqualification when Duggan entered the ring while chasing Volkoff and then hitting the Sheik with his 2x4 while he had the camel clutch on &quot;Jumping&quot; Jim Brunzell).

==== The Bolsheviks (1987–1990) ====

In late 1987, Volkoff was teamed with Boris Zhukov, another purported Russian (played by American James Harrell), to form the Bolsheviks. They feuded with WWF newcomers the Powers of Pain, losing to them at the inaugural &quot;SummerSlam&quot; PPV in 1988. As they lost the public eye due to many losses, they eventually lost their manager Slick and were used as a comic relief team losing many matches to the Bushwhackers. The Bolsheviks never held any titles together, and are perhaps best remembered for being defeated in 19 seconds by the Hart Foundation at WrestleMania VI. Eventually, by 1990, the Bolsheviks split up. Volkoff publicly ended the partnership prior to a match where he confronted Zhukhov and then started singing &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, drawing loud cheers from the audience and turning babyface in the process.

==== Babyface turn (1990; 1992) ====
A short time after the Bolsheviks split, Volkoff became a face for the first time in his career. His gimmick was now that of a recent defector, he became very pro-west which led to a feud with Sgt. Slaughter who had an Iraqi sympathizer role and teamed with the former Iron Sheik, who had recently begun an Iraqi gimmick under the name Colonel Mustafa. After Volkoff&#x27;s team defeated Slaughter&#x27;s team at the 1990 Survivor Series (Tito Santana was the sole survivor), Volkoff left the WWF at the end of 1990. He made a brief return to compete in the 1992 Royal Rumble match, as well as to face Hercules in a house show match on January 29 in Lowell, Massachusetts.
===Various promotions (1991-1994)===
After leaving WWF, Volkoff began competing in the independent circuit. On May 3, 1991, he defeated his former Bolshevik partner Boris Zhukov for Trans World Wrestling Federation in Newington, Connecticut. On August 8, 1992, he went to Puerto Rico to wrestled for World Wrestling Council WWC 19th Anniversario 1992 losing to the Patriot. On April 4, 1993, he wrestled his former partner the Iron Sheik to a double count out at Wrestling in the USA event in Livingston, New Jersey.

===Eastern Championship Wrestling (1992–1993)===
In 1992 he went to Eastern Championship Wrestling in Philadelphia where he feuded with Vladimir Markoff. On October 2, he lost to ECW Champion Don Muraco. He then returned to ECW on October 16, 1993, as he lost to Jimmy Snuka.

===Third return to the WWF (1993; 1994-1995)===
==== One night appearance (1993) ====

He returned as a babyface to pin Barry Horowitz at a &quot;WWF Superstars&quot;/&quot;All-American Wrestling&quot; taping on July 6, 1993, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.

==== The Million Dollar Corporation; departure (1994–1995) ====

On February 1, 1994, Volkoff began a full-time return to the WWF, making a ringside appearance at a Superstars taping in White Plains, New York during a match between Diesel and Mike Moraldo. For the next two months, Volkoff was shown in the crowd, until eventually he became a sympathetic heel by playing the whipping-boy of Ted DiBiase&#x27;s Million Dollar Corporation. Volkoff had kayfabe fallen on hard times and was forced to take a job working for DiBiase and his new Corporation. As low man in the group he was forced to wrestle matches no one else wanted to or sent out to &quot;soften up&quot; opponents for other members of the stable as the sacrificial lamb of the group. The disrespect even extended to renaming him &quot;Nickel &amp; Dime&quot; Volkoff and DiBiase forcing him to place a ¢ on his trunks where the Russian sickle once was along with a sign on his ring attire that read &quot;Property of the Million Dollar Man&quot;. The final WWF match for Volkoff was on December 30, 1994, when he defeated jobber Bob Starr in a house show. Volkoff&#x27;s final appearance was at the WWF&#x27;s final show at the Boston Garden on May 13, 1995. During a match between Bam Bam Bigelow and Tatanka, Volkoff made an appearance to chase Tatanka&#x27;s manager Ted Dibiase away. Following this last run in the WWF, Volkoff entered semi-retirement.

===Semi-retirement (1995–2018)===
Volkoff made a brief cameo on an episode of &quot;Shotgun Saturday Night&quot; in 1997 where Todd Pettengill discovered him homeless sleeping in a box on the streets of New York City. He also appeared at WrestleMania X-Seven at the Astrodome in Houston in the gimmick battle royal which was won by the Iron Sheik. On November 30, 2001, he lost to King Kong Bundy at AAWA event in Jersey City, New Jersey. On February 3, 2005, Volkoff was announced as one of the WWE Hall of Fame inductees for the class of 2005. He was inducted on April 2, 2005, by Jim Ross at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles. In 2006, Volkoff took part in the World Wrestling Legends pay-per-view &quot;6:05 The Reunion&quot;. Managed by the Iron Sheik, he wrestled a match against Duggan. Before the match, he once again sang the national anthem of the Soviet Union and riled up the crowd. Volkoff made his first appearance on WWE television in over two years on the August 13, 2007 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; as a contestant on WWE Idol, a parody of &quot;American Idol&quot;. Volkoff appeared alongside the Iron Sheik and Howard Finkel, although Volkoff was the only one who sang. Volkoff sang the Soviet Union national anthem, receiving boos from the crowd (despite being a babyface) and was insulted by judge William Regal, although judges Mick Foley and Maria both praised the performance. In response, Sheik, who was also insulted, went on a tirade until both he and Volkoff were escorted out of the building by security.
The March 10, 2008, edition of &quot;WWE Raw&quot;, featured rematches from previous WrestleManias. The Iron Sheik appeared along with Nikolai Volkoff to face off against the U.S. Express in a rematch from the first WrestleMania. The match never started as Jillian Hall came out to interrupt Volkoff&#x27;s singing so she could sing Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;, which the U.S. Express used as their ring entrance music in 1984–85. On the November 15, 2010, edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, as part of the &quot;old school&quot; theme, Volkoff appeared with the Iron Sheik, singing the Soviet national anthem before being interrupted by Santino Marella and Vladimir Kozlov, the latter of whom then sung a duet with Volkoff of the Soviet national anthem. Afterwards, Volkoff worked for various independent promotions throughout North America. He remained popular on the autograph convention circuit. In June 2013 he threw out the first pitch at a Bowie Baysox baseball game and sang &quot;God Bless America&quot; after the pitch. In October 2013, he sang the Soviet national anthem at a show in New Jersey, after being introduced by Howard Finkel.
Volkoff lent his name to a forward for a fiction novel called &quot;Only the Beginning&quot; which is set in the 1980s and is about a girl&#x27;s life during high school. While the book is not wrestling related, the author Jason Strecker was a personal friend of Volkoff&#x27;s and in the foreword Volkoff responds to his friendship with the author along with the book&#x27;s message of being of strong character and doing positive actions for others. The book also has a foreword by Jimmy Valiant. On the January 6, 2014, &quot;Old School&quot; episode of &quot;RAW&quot;, Volkoff encountered Big E. Langston on his way to a match and sung him the Soviet national anthem, to which Langston smiled. Immediately after, Langston walked past fellow Million Dollar Corporation members, Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster. On the RAW Fallout segment following the September 8, 2014 &quot;Raw&quot;, Volkoff appeared backstage with Rusev and Lana and sang the Soviet national anthem. On February 28, 2015, Volkoff appeared for the Superstars of Wrestling promotion in Bayville, New Jersey, where he teamed with ECW legend the Sandman to take on independent standouts Kentucky Bred – in a 3 on 2 handicap tag match. Before the match, Volkoff and Sandman sang the Soviet national anthem and proceeded to drink beer together. The duo squashed Kentucky Bred and then poured beer all over them.

On March 21, 2015, Volkoff participated at a SICW event taking place on East Carondelet. Volkoff managed and mentored the team of younger wrestlers Ricky Cruz and Red River Jack, while also managing veteran wrestler &quot;Cowboy&quot; Bob Orton Jr. to take on the team of Chris Hargas, Bull Bronson, and Attila Khan. Volkoff and Orton appeared in their outfit and gimmick from their WWF days. The team of Volkoff, Orton, Cruz, and Jack came up victorious. On March 5, 2016, Volkoff showed up at Night of Legends at Billtown Wrestling in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, sang the American national anthem and teamed with Cash Money, who turned on him to give the win to Koko B. Ware and Jim Neidhart. On June 25, 2016, he wrestled his last match in Canada where he defeated the Messiah for Great North Wrestling in Pembroke, Ontario. On June 9, 2017, Volkoff wrestled for H2O Wrestling: 1 Year Anniversary in Willamstown, New Jersey as he defeated D. J. Hyde. On May 5, 2018, at the age of 70, Volkoff wrestled his final match, teaming with Jim Duggan to defeat the team of Mecha Mercenary and Nicky Benz for Battleground Championship Wrestling in Feasterville, Pennsylvania.

<text>Handsworth is a suburb of south eastern Sheffield, in South Yorkshire, England. It covers an area of approximately , and has a population of approximately 9,957. It has five schools, four churches, a variety of small shops, a large supermarket, and a range of commercial and light industrial businesses. Until 1974 it was in the West Riding of Yorkshire.

Politically, Handsworth is part of the Woodhouse ward in the Sheffield South East parliamentary constituency.

==History==
In 1931 the civil parish had a population of 17,472. On 1 April 1938 the parish was abolished and merged with Sheffield and Orgreave. It is now in the unparished area of Sheffield.

===Domesday Book===
In the Domesday Book account, Handsworth is spelt &quot;Handeswrde&quot; and is joined to Whiston (&quot;Witestan&quot;) to form a single manor. Before the Conquest, Torchil (or Turchil) is reported as being the Lord of the Manor, but following the Conquest lordship was transferred to Robert, Count of Mortain, who was the half-brother of William the Conqueror. Richard de Sourdeval held it for Count Robert. The Manor then passed, through marriage, to the Paynel and Lovetot families. It was a member of the Lovetot family who built the parish church in Handsworth.

===St Mary&#x27;s Church===
St Mary&#x27;s was built in about 1170. It was founded by the Norman lord William de Lovetot, or his father Richard, and the foundations were planned by William Paynel. (The church is not to be confused with St Mary&#x27;s Church, Handsworth, in Birmingham.)
Little of the Tudor rectory remains today. Handsworth&#x27;s parish registers, recording all baptisms, marriages and burials which took place in the parish of St Mary&#x27;s, date back to 1558, the year that Queen Elizabeth I ascended the throne.

St Mary&#x27;s Parish Centre holds displays of artefacts, documents, records, photographs and maps relating to Handsworth and its history.

==Handsworth sword dancers==
One aspect of Handsworth history which remains very much alive is the traditional sword dancing. The origins of this ancient ritual are unknown, but written records held by the team go back to the middle of the 19th century.

Using long steel swords, a team of eight men perform a dance which lasts about nine minutes and ends with all the swords being interlocked and held aloft by one man. Traditional music is played and the dancers wear a military style uniform similar to the Dragoons.

Formerly there were two clowns who performed for the crowd and collected money. At Christmas time, the sword dancers would tour the local villages and public houses. The sword dancing continued until the First World War and there was a revival of interest during the late 1920s. It survived through the Second World War because the sword dancers had priority occupations in the coal mines and in the steel works, so they were not conscripted.

The traditional dancing on Boxing Day in Handsworth and Woodhouse was revived in 1963, and in 1976 the clowns were reintroduced, though they later lapsed. The historic sight of Handsworth sword dancing can still be seen on Boxing Day (or the day after if it falls on a Sunday). They dance at Woodhouse Cross at 11.15 and in front of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Handsworth, at noon. The dancers and their audience then adjourn to the pub for well-earned refreshment and communal carol singing.

==Sport==
Handsworth has been represented by three teams notable teams in senior football:
* Handsworth F.C. – Competed in the 1921–22 FA Cup, although little else is known about the club.
* Handsworth F.C. – The second club to take the name of Handsworth F.C. was formed in 2003, and after competing in the Sheffield County Senior League for seven years they won promotion to the Northern Counties East League. After two years in the NCEL they were relegated back to the County Senior League as their ground was deemed unfit to host NCEL football. After winning the County Senior League in 2014 they merged with Parramore Sports F.C. to form Handsworth Parramore F.C. 
* Handsworth Parramore F.C. – Formed in 2014 as the result of a merger between Handsworth F.C. and Parramore Sports F.C. They were entered into the Northern Counties East League Premier Division and subsequently made their FA Cup debut. They changed their name to Handsworth F.C. in 2019.

==Notable people==

=== Stayce family===
The Handsworth parish registers reveal that on 1 July 1638, Mahlon Stayce was baptised in St Mary&#x27;s Church. The Stayce family had lived at Ballifield Hall in Handsworth for centuries but it was in Trenton, New Jersey, in America, that Mahlon made his name and his fortune.

The Stayce family were Quakers, one of the new religious sects which surfaced in England after the Civil War. They dissented from traditional views and to &quot;respectable&quot; society, the Quakers appeared extreme and even revolutionary. Their leader, George Fox, preached on Cinder Hill Green in Handsworth to thousands of people in the 1650s. During the Interregnum, Quakers were treated with suspicion and hostility, and persecution continued following the restoration of Charles II, as they still refused to conform, even outwardly, to the Church of England. Their refusal to take off their hats or speak respectfully when in the presence of &quot;nobles&quot; made them a particular object of mistrust.

Some members of the Stayce family are buried in a private Quaker graveyard at Cinder Hill, now in the back garden of a house. There are eight gravestones with plain inscriptions.

===Benjamin Huntsman===
Another Quaker buried near Handsworth is Benjamin Huntsman. Although he was born in Lincolnshire, he lived for some years at Handsworth in the 1740s. Huntsman made a highly significant scientific discovery which enabled Sheffield to develop from small township into one of the leading northern industrial cities that shaped the destiny of Victorian Britain.

Huntsman revolutionised the technology of steel making through his invention of &quot;cast&quot; or &quot;crucible steel&quot;. Whilst in Handsworth, he developed the process whereby it became possible to melt down raw or &quot;blister steel&quot; and produce cast ingots of steel. This required an extremely high temperature of 1,600 degrees Celsius, something which had never been achieved before in the steel industry. In order to produce and sustain such a high temperature in his furnace, Huntsman used coke instead of charcoal. To contain the steel he designed a clay crucible which could withstand the severe temperature and possible attack of the metal. It seems probable that Huntsman moved to Handsworth because he was aware of the nearby glassworks in Catcliffe where vessels were used in which the materials were melted at very high temperatures. Huntsman found that he could benefit in Handsworth not only from the experience of the glass makers but also from the ready access to refractory materials and fireclays in the Sheffield district.

Huntsman&#x27;s techniques were initially given scant recognition in Sheffield. The local cutlers thought the new steel was too hard and difficult to handle. But rival Europeans nations, especially France, quickly took advantage of the superior quality of crucible steel. Eventually, this competition from overseas encouraged the Sheffield cutlers to adopt Huntsman&#x27;s methods, thereby laying the foundations of Sheffield&#x27;s industrial heritage. In 1740, Sheffield produced only 200 tons of steel per year; by 1860, this total had risen, because of the application of Huntsman&#x27;s techniques, to over 80,000 tons per year—almost half of Europe&#x27;s total tonnage.

===William Jeffcock===

William Jeffcock, who became the first Mayor of Sheffield in 1843, was born in April 1800 in Handsworth. His baptism is recorded in the parish registers; and, although he died in Ireland, he is buried in a family vault in Handsworth.

The Jeffcock family settled in Handsworth in the 17th century, having moved from Eckington, Derbyshire. The earliest record of the family name occurs in the court rolls of the manor of Eckington in 1351. But they settled in the Handsworth parish, and there are over 60 entries in the parish registers for members of the Jeffcock family between 1636 and 1768. John Jeffcock, father of William, established the family name as coal masters by becoming colliery engineer at Dore House Colliery in Handsworth. William was able to build upon his father&#x27;s commercial success by entering the realm of the local government. He was keen to play an active role in the civic affairs and so became a candidate for Attercliffe ward in the town&#x27;s first municipal elections on 1 November 1843. Although he polled only 80 votes, he was elected. Meeting for the first time on 9 November 1843, the new town council unanimously chose William Jeffcock to be the first mayor. He also became an Alderman and remained on the Council for 10 years. He was also nominated as a Justice of the Peace for the West Riding of Yorkshire in 1846 and he held a Commission in the West Yorkshire Yeomanry Cavalry for some time.

For many years, the Jeffcocks lived in nearby High Hazels. John Jeffcock was the first to live there, but it was his son William who built a new mansion on the site in 1850. The closeness of the Jeffcock connection to Handsworth can be seen in St Mary&#x27;s churchyard. Two box tombs in memory of the family bear inscriptions to over a dozen Jeffcocks. There are other memorials to members of the Jeffcock family in St Mary&#x27;s Church, and there is a (disused) fountain and water trough bearing inscriptions to the family on a curve of Handsworth Road.

===Thomas Dunn===
William Jeffcock was succeeded as Sheffield&#x27;s Mayor in 1844 by his first cousin, Thomas Dunn, who was also a Handsworth resident. Dunn was elected to the first town council in 1843 and served on it for 16 years. He was an Alderman and became a distinguished figure in mid-Victorian Sheffield. Dunn had a considered Liberal point of view and he took an active and prominent role in Sheffield politics. His intellect and popularity made many national Liberals, as well as local ones, seek to persuade him to stand for parliament. His funeral in 1871 was attended by many local dignitaries.

===Percy &quot;Pick&quot; Pickard===
Group Captain Percy Charles &quot;Pick&quot; Pickard (1915–1944) was a Royal Air Force bomber pilot and commander during the Second World War. He was born in Handsworth and educated at Framlingham College. He is remembered for his role in the 1941 wartime propaganda film &quot;Target for Tonight&quot;, in which he featured as the pilot of &quot;F-Freddie&quot;. He was killed on Operation Jericho in 1944. His sister, also born in Handsworth, was actress Helena Pickard, who married actor Sir Cedric Hardwicke and was the mother of actor Edward Hardwicke.

===Sean Bean===
Actor Sean Bean, born 1959, grew up in Handsworth and attended Brook School (now a housing estate). Bean appeared in the films &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;Patriot Games&quot;, &quot;GoldenEye&quot; and more. He also starred in the historical TV series, &quot;Sharpe&quot;, and worldwide phenomenon &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;.

<text>Apples () is a former municipality in the district of Morges in the canton of Vaud, Switzerland.
On 1 July 2021 the former municipalities of Apples, Cottens, Pampigny, Sévery, Bussy-Chardonney and Reverolle merged into the new municipality of Hautemorges.

== History ==
Apples has a long history of settlements. Remains from the Neolithic, the Bronze Age, and the Romans have been found in the municipality. The first true settlement was founded by the Burgundians in the 5th century. It was most likely called &quot;Iplingen&quot;. Under the Romans this name probably was changed to &quot;Iplens&quot; and then &quot;Aplis&quot;. It was with this name that the village was first mentioned in a document, in 1011, when King Rudolf III presented the church and the village to the Romainmôtier Monastery as a gift. The spelling &quot;Aples&quot; appeared later (in 1222) and the current name came into use in 1328.
With the capture of Vaud by Bern in 1536, Apples became an exclave under the administration of the Romainmôtier district. After the collapse of the Ancien régime, the village became a part of the canton of Léman, from 1798 to 1803. It was subsequently absorbed by the canton of Vaud, and in 1798 it became a part of the Morges District.

In 1803 Apples was moved to the district of Aubonne. In 2006 Apples was moved back into Morges

==Geography==
Apples is located at above mean sea level (ASML), northwest of the city of Morges. The scattered villages of Apples span a knoll on the edge of a plateau, located at the foot of the Jura Mountains. This is in Swiss Plateau, an area full of impressive views looking out over the Morges River valley.

The municipality contains a section in its eastern edge of the French Plateau. The eastern part of the municipality is located in the drainage basin of the Morges Creek and the &quot;Le Curbit&quot; creek. In the western section of the municipality, which is larger by far, there is a glacial landscape of molasse hills with extensive woods and moor-like depressions. Several forests are a part of this western section: &quot;Les Bougeries&quot; (up to AMSL in the southwest), &quot;Bois de Saint-Pierre&quot; (up to AMSL in the north), and &quot;Bois de Savoye&quot; and &quot;Bois de Fermens&quot; in the northwest. The highest point in Apples is in the forest &quot;La Chaux-Derrière&quot; at a height of AMSL. On its western border, the municipality reaches the edge of a former river valley, &quot;Grand Marais&quot;, which once served as a channel for glacial melt waters from the Rhône Glacier. This valley is drained by the Veyron River to the northeast.

Two new isolated developments, &quot;En Lèvremont&quot; ( AMSL) and &quot;La Motte&quot; ( AMSL), are also a part of Apples. They are located on the gentle slopes of the Morges Valley. The municipalities that border Apples are Ballens, Mollens, Pampigny, Sévery, Colombier, Clarmont, Reverolle, Bussy-Chardonney und Yens.

Apples has an area, , of . Of this area, or 46.2% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 47.8% is forested. Of the rest of the land, or 6.3% is settled (buildings or roads).

Of the built up area, housing and buildings made up 2.7% and transportation infrastructure made up 2.9%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 43.5% is used for growing crops and 2.3% is pastures.

The municipality was part of the Aubonne District until it was dissolved on 31 August 2006, and Apples became part of the new district of Morges.

==Coat of arms==
The blazon of the municipal coat of arms is &quot;Per pale Argent and Gules, overall a bend Or with three torteaus (= roundels Gules).&quot;

==Demographics==
Apples has a population () of . , 13.9% of the population are resident foreign nationals. Over the last 10 years (1999–2009 ) the population has changed at a rate of 7.7%. It has changed at a rate of 8.5% due to migration and at a rate of -0.9% due to births and deaths.

Most of the population () speaks French (999 or 86.2%), with German being second most common (84 or 7.2%) and Portuguese being third (22 or 1.9%). There are 17 people who speak Italian.
