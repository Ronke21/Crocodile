<text>Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay (anglicized as [[Chatterjee]]) (26 or 27 June 1838 – 8 April 1894) was an Indian Bengali novelist, poet, essayist and journalist. He was the author of the 1882 Bengali language novel &quot;Anandamath&quot;, which is one of the landmarks of modern Bengali and Indian literature. He was the composer of &quot;Vande Mataram&quot;, written in highly Sanskritised Bengali, personifying India as a mother goddess and inspiring activists during the Indian Independence Movement. Chattopadhayay wrote fourteen novels and many serious, serio-comic, satirical, scientific and critical treatises in Bengali. He is known as Sahitya Samrat (Emperor of Literature) in Bengali.

== Biography ==
Chattopadhayay is widely regarded as a key figure in literary renaissance of Bengal as well as the broader Indian subcontinent. Some of his writings, including novels, essays and commentaries, broke away from traditional verse-oriented Indian writings,
and provided an inspiration for authors across India.

Chattopadhayay was born in the village of Kanthalpara in the town of North 24 Parganas, Naihati, in an orthodox Bengali Brahmin family, the youngest of three brothers, to Yadav Chandra Chattopadhayay and Durgadebi. His ancestors hailed from Deshmukho village in Hooghly District. His father, a government official, went on to become the Deputy Collector of Midnapur. One of his brothers, Sanjib Chandra Chattopadhyay was also a novelist and is known for his book &quot;Palamau&quot;. Bankim Chandra and his elder brother both went to Hooghly Collegiate School (then Governmental Zilla School), where he wrote his first poem. He was educated at the Hooghly Mohsin College and later at Presidency College, Kolkata, graduating with a degree in arts in 1859. He later attended the University of Calcutta and was one of two candidates who passed the final exam to become the school&#x27;s first graduates. He later obtained a degree in law in 1869. Following his father&#x27;s footsteps, Bankimchandra joined the Subordinate Executive Service. In 1858, he was appointed a Deputy Magistrate (the same type of position held by his father) of Jessore. After merging of the services in 1863, he went on to become Deputy Magistrate &amp; Deputy Collector, retiring from government service in 1891. Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay was the first in-charge (Sub-divisional magistrate) of the Arambag subdivision in its earlier days. The ruins of a fort at Gar Mandaran provided the setting for Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay&#x27;s novel Durgeshnandini, published in 1865. His years at work were replete with incidents that brought him into conflict with the colonial government. He was, however, made a Companion of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire (CMEOIE) in 1894. He also received the title of Rai Bahadur in 1891.

==Literary career==

Chattopadhyay&#x27;s earliest publications were in Ishwar Chandra Gupta&#x27;s weekly newspaper &quot;Sangbad Prabhakar&quot;. He began his literary career as a writer of verse before turning to fiction. His first attempt was a novel in Bengali submitted for a declared prize. He did not win and the novelette was never published. His first fiction to appear in print was the English novel &quot;Rajmohan&#x27;s Wife&quot;. &quot;Durgeshnandini&quot;, his first Bengali romance and the first ever novel in Bengali, was published in 1865. His essay ‘Shakuntala, Miranda ebong Desdemona’ (1873) is considered as the first attempt of comparative analysis of different literatures in Bengali and is studied closely in school of comparative literature of Jadavpur University.

One of the many novels of Chattopadhyay that are entitled to be termed as historical fiction is &quot;Rajsimha&quot; (1881, rewritten and enlarged 1893). &quot;Anandamath&quot; (The Abbey of Bliss, 1882) is a political novel which depicts a Sannyasi (Hindu ascetic) army fighting a British force. The book calls for the rise of Indian nationalism. The novel was also the source of the song &quot;Vande Mataram&quot; (I worship my Motherland for she truly is my mother) which, set to music by Rabindranath Tagore, was taken up by many Indian nationalists, and is now the National Song of India. The plot of the novel is loosely set on the Sannyasi Rebellion. He imagined untrained Sannyasi soldiers fighting and defeating the British East India Company; ultimately, however, he accepted that the British Empire could not be defeated. The novel first appeared in serial form in &quot;Bangadarshan&quot;, the literary magazine that Chattopadhyay founded in 1872. &quot;Vande Mataram&quot; became prominent during the Swadeshi movement, which was sparked by Lord Curzon&#x27;s attempt to partition Bengal into a Hindu majority West and Muslim majority East. Drawing from the Shakti tradition of Bengali Hindus, Chattopadhyay personified India as a Mother Goddess known as Bharat Mata, which gave the song a Hindu undertone.

Bankim was particularly impressed by the historical Gaudiya Vaishnava cultural efflorescence of the 14th and 15th centuries in Bengal. Chattopadhyay&#x27;s commentary on the Bhagavad Gita was published eight years after his death and contained his comments up to the 19th Verse of Chapter 4.
In a long essay on Sankhya philosophy, he argues that the central philosophical foundation of the overwhelming part of religious beliefs in India, including even Buddhism, lies in the philosophy of Sankhya. He was a critique of the philosophy in the sense of its emphasis on personal &quot;vairagya&quot; (renunciation) rather than political and social power.

==Meeting with Ramakrishna==
*Bankim was highly educated and influenced by Oriental thoughts and ideas. Ramakrishna in contrast, did not have knowledge of English. Yet they had a nice relation between them. Once Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa, playing on the meaning of Bankim (&quot;Bent A Little&quot;), asked him what it was that had bent him. Bankim Chandra jokingly replied that it was the kick from the Englishman&#x27;s shoe for he was a well-known critic of the British government.

==Legacy==
*Tagore penned in the memory of his mentor:
&quot;Bankim Chandra had equal strength in both his hands, he was a true &quot;sabyasachi&quot; (ambidextrous). With one hand, he created literary works of excellence; and with the other, he guided young and aspiring authors. With one hand, he ignited the light of literary enlightenment; and with the other, he blew away the smoke and ash of ignorance and ill conceived notions&quot;

*Sri Aurobindo wrote in his memory:
&quot;The earlier Bankim was only a poet and stylist, the later Bankim was a seer and nation-builder&quot;

*After the &quot;Vishabriksha&quot; (&quot;The Poison Tree&quot;) was published in 1873, the magazine, Punch wrote:

::&quot;You ought to read the Poison Tree 
::of Bankim Chandra Chatterjee.&quot;
::
::
::

*His novel &quot;Anushilan-Tattva&quot; inspired Pramathanath Mitra to start Anushilan Samiti.
*Bankim Puraskar (Bankim Memorial Award) is the highest award given by the Government of West Bengal for contribution to Bengali fiction.

<doc id="539168" wikidata="Q24410897" url="?curid=539168" title="Legislative Yuan elections">
<text>In Taiwan, parliamentary elections are held every four years to elect the 113 members of the Legislative Yuan, the unicameral legislature of Taiwan. The current electoral system was introduced in 2008. The constitutional amendments of 2005 extended term length from three to four years, reduced seat count from 225 to 113, and abolished the National Assembly, originally another governmental organ equivalent to a chamber of parliament.

== Current electoral system ==
Members are elected by parallel voting:
* 73 members by first-past-the-post in single-member districts
* 6 by single non-transferable voting in multi-member districts, exclusive for persons with indigenous status
* 34 by party-list proportional representation voting

=== Single-member constituencies ===
The delimitation of the single-member constituencies within the cities and counties was initially a major political issue in the early years, with bargaining between the government and the legislature. Of the 15 cities and counties to be partitioned (the ten others have only one seat), only seven of the districting schemes proposed by the CEC were approved in a normal way. The eight other schemes were decided by drawing lots: &quot;Taipei and Taichung cities and Miaoli and Changhua counties will adopt the version suggested by the CEC, while Kaohsiung city will follow the consensus of the legislature. Taipei county will follow the proposal offered by the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union, Taoyuan county will adopt the ruling Democratic Progressive Party&#x27;s scheme, and Pingtung county will use the scheme agreed upon by the Non-partisan Solidarity Union, People First Party, Kuomintang and Taiwan Solidarity Union.&quot;

Under Articles 35 and 37 of the , the electoral constituencies are to be revised every ten years based on population density. Demographic data is obtained by investigation of household registration and should be compiled two years and two months before the tenure of current legislators end. The Central Election Commission reviews the boundaries, then submits any proposed alterations to the Legislative Yuan 20 months before the election for final consent and announcement.

=== Indigenous districts ===
Six seats are reserved for indigenous peoples. They are elected by single non-transferable vote in two 3-member constituencies for lowland aborigines and highland aborigines respectively. This system did not fulfil the promise in the treaty-like document &quot;A New Partnership Between the Indigenous Peoples and the Government of Taiwan&quot;, where each of the 13 recognised indigenous peoples was to get at least one seat, and the distinction between highland and lowland abolished.

=== Party-list ===
Seats are allocated using the largest remainder method with the Hare quota which, with 34 seats, is 2.9412%. A party&#x27;s vote share must exceed a threshold of 5% to win any seats. Votes for parties which do not pass the threshold are first excluded. The vote share for the remaining parties are calculated. A party is allocated one seat for every 2.9412% of votes. The remaining seats are allocated in succession to the party with the largest remainder.

For each party, at least half of the legislators elected under this system must be female. Therefore, with an odd number of seats, females will always outnumber males.

== Parliamentary elections since 1991 ==
==Early parliamentary supplementary elections (1969–1989)==
According to the interpretation of the Constitutional Court (Judicial Yuan), under the original constitution the National Assembly, Legislative Yuan, and Control Yuan were seen to constitute the Parliament in Taiwan. After 20 years of relocating the government to Taiwan, the Kuomintang-led government of the Republic of China amended the &quot;Temporary Provisions against the Communist Rebellion&quot; to start limited parliamentary elections. Delegates of the National Assembly and members of the Legislative Yuan are directly elected, while members of the Control Yuan were indirectly elected by the provincial legislatures. The elected members served together with existing members elected by the 1947 Chinese National Assembly election, the 1948 Chinese legislative election, and the 1947-1948 Chinese Control Yuan election in the respective chambers.

<doc id="539170" wikidata="Q805804" url="?curid=539170" title="Baltistan">
<text>Baltistan; also known as Baltiyul or Little Tibet, is a mountainous region in the Pakistani-administered territory of Gilgit-Baltistan and constitutes a northern portion of the larger Kashmir region that has been the subject of a dispute between India and Pakistan since 1947. It is located near the Karakoram (south of K2) and borders Gilgit to the west, China&#x27;s Xinjiang to the north, Indian-administered Ladakh to the southeast, and the Indian-administered Kashmir Valley to the southwest. The average altitude of the region is over . Baltistan is largely administered under the Baltistan Division.

Prior to the partition of British India in 1947, Baltistan was part of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, having been conquered by Gulab Singh&#x27;s armies in 1840. Baltistan and Ladakh were administered jointly under one &quot;wazarat&quot; (district) of the state. The region retained its identity in this setup as the Skardu &quot;tehsil&quot;, with Kargil and Leh being the other two &quot;tehsils&quot; of the district. After Hari Singh, the last &quot;maharaja&quot; of Jammu and Kashmir, acceded to the Dominion of India in 1947, his local governor in Gilgit was overthrown by the Gilgit Scouts, who then took the entire region for Pakistan during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948; the Gilgit Agency and Baltistan have since been under Pakistani governance while the Kashmir Valley and the Kargil and Leh &quot;tehsils&quot; remain under Indian governance. However, four mountainous communities, including the village of Turtuk in the Nubra Valley, have been under Indian control since 1971, when they were all incorporated into the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir (now in Ladakh) after being captured by India during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.

The region is inhabited primarily by the Balti people, a largely Muslim ethnic group of Tibetan descent. Baltistan is strategically significant to both Pakistan and India; the Siachen conflict and the Kargil War took place in this region alongside others.

==Etymology==
Like other Islamic regions near the Indian subcontinent, the name Baltistan is likely created by adding the Persian suffix -istan to the name of the Balti people, who lived here before the Islamic conquests. 

== Geography ==
The 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica characterises Baltistan as the western extremity of Tibet, whose natural limits are the Indus River from its abrupt southward bend around the map point and the mountains to the north and west. These features separate a comparatively peaceful Tibetan population from the Indo-Aryan tribes to the west. Muslim writers around the 16th century speak of Baltistan as the &quot;Little Tibet&quot;, and of Ladakh as the &quot;Great Tibet&quot;, emphasising their ethnological similarity. According to Ahmad Hassan Dani, Baltistan spreads upwards from the Indus river and is separated from Ladakh by the Siachen Glacier. It includes the Indus valley and the lower valley of the Shyok river.

Baltistan is a rocky mass of lofty mountains, the prevailing formation being gneiss. In the north is the Baltoro Glacier, one of the longest glaciers outside of the polar regions, long, contained between two ridges whose highest peaks to the south are and to the north .

The Indus river runs in a narrow gorge, widening after receiving the Shyok river at . It then forms a crescent-shaped plain varying between in width. The main inhabitable valleys of Kharmang, Khaplu, Skardu and Roundu are along the routes of these rivers.
== Administration ==
The Baltistan is one of three divisions of Gilgit-Baltistan. The Division of Baltistan is administrative under a Commissioner of BPS-20 belonging to Pakistan Administrative Service group of Central Superior Services of Pakistan. The Current Commissioner Baltistan Division is Mr Shula Alam (PAS).

===Valleys and districts===

°*Although part of Baltistan, Turtuk has been Indian-administered following territorial exchanges in 1972 Simla treaty.

== History ==
=== Origins ===

Today, the people of Kharmang and Western Khaplu have Tibetan features and those in Skardu, Shigar and the eastern villages of Khaplu are Dards. It was believed that the Balti people were in the sphere of influence of Zhangzhung. Baltistan was controlled by the Tibetan king in 686. Culturally influenced by Tibet, the Bon and animist Baltis began to adopt Tibetan Buddhism. Religious artifacts such as &quot;gompas&quot; and &quot;stupas&quot; were built, and lamas played an important role in Balti life.
For centuries, Baltistan consisted of small, independent valley states connected by the blood relationships of its rulers (&quot;rajas&quot;), trade, common beliefs and cultural and linguistic bonds. Baltistan was known as Little Tibet, and the name was extended to include Ladakh. Ladakh later became known as Great Tibet. Locally, Baltistan is known as &quot;Baltiyul&quot; and Ladakh and Baltistan are known as Maryul (&quot;red country&quot;).

=== Medieval and early modern history ===
Medieval Baltistan was divided into three main kingdoms: Skardu, Shigar, and Khaplu. The Maqpon dynasty, which ruled from Skardu, also later established side branches at Kartaksho and Rondu.

In 1190, Maqpon dynasty of Skardu was founded by Ibrahim Shah (1190-1220), who was born in Skardu. This royal family ruled over Baltistan for approximately 700 years. The kings of the Maqpon dynasty extended the frontiers of Baltistan to Gilgit Agency, Chitral, and Ladakh.

The Kingdom of Khaplu probably came into existence around the 10th century following the breakup of the Tibetan Empire. Its ruling dynasty was known as the Yabgu dynasty, after the Turkish title of yabghu. The local population was Buddhist up until around the 14th century, when Sayyid Alī Hamadānī is credited with spreading Islam to the region. Khaplu was conquered by Skardu under Alī Sher Khān Anchan in the early 1600s. From then on, it was administered by a governor, or &quot;kharpon&quot;, appointed by the ruler in Skardu. The last kharpon was Yulehing Karīm, who governed Khaplu from 1820 to 1840, when the Dogra commander Zorāwar Singh conquered it.

During the 14th century, Muslim scholars from Kashmir crossed Baltistan&#x27;s mountainous terrain to spread Islam. The Noorbakshia Sufi order further propagated the faith in Baltistan and Islam became dominant by the end of the 17th century. With the passage of time a large number also converted to Shia Islam and a few converted to Sunni Islam.

In the late 1500s/early 1600s, the Maqpon rulers of Skardu expanded their kingdom to include Shigar, Astor, Rondu, and Karataksha. The greatest ruler during this period was Alī Sher Khān, known as &quot;Anchan&quot;, or &quot;the Great&quot;. After the Mughal conquest of Kashmir in 1586, during the reign of Anchan&#x27;s grandfather Ghāzī Mīr, diplomatic relations developed between the Mughals and the Maqpon rulers of Baltistan. A Balti princess was sent to the Mughal court, and according to local tradition, a Mughal princess was also sent to Skardu and built a Mughal-style fort at Mandok. Around 1595, the Mughal historian Abu&#x27;l-Fazl wrote that Kashmir was then importing silkworm eggs (for sericulture) from Gilgit and Baltistan.

After the death of Anchan in 1633, the Maqpon polity declined as his three sons fought among themselves. One of them, Adam Khān, had fled to Kashmir and then sought refuge with the Mughal emperor Jahāngīr while Anchan was still alive. In 1637, Adam accompanied a Mughal expedition into Baltistan led by Zafar Khān. Adam&#x27;s elder brother (and rival) Abdāl was captured, and Zafar Khān announced Mughal suzerainty over Baltistan. However, with winter coming, Zafar hastily withdrew his troops from Baltistan and appointed one of Abdāl&#x27;s partisans to govern the territory on his behalf, which upset the Mughal emperor Shāh Jahān. Ultimately, though, Adam Khān ended up taking control of Baltistan. Both he and his successor, Murād Khān, acknowledged Mughal suzerainty.

The official Mughal historian Abdul Hamid Lahori left an account of Baltistan in his entry for the year 1638. He wrote that Baltistan had 22 &quot;pargana&quot;s and 37 forts. Its narrow mountain valleys could support limited cultivation, primarily of wheat and barley; certain fruits also thrived in the local climate. Rather poor-quality gold was collected from river sands in small amounts – only about 2,000 &quot;tola&quot;s (about 9.5 kg) was collected per year.
The Kharmang came under the control of the Namgyal royal family and developed a close relationship with Ladakh when the &quot;raja&quot; of Ladakh, Jamyang Mangyal, attacked the principalities in Kargil. Mangyal annihilated the Skardu garrison at Kharbu and put to the sword a number of petty Muslim rulers in the principalities of Purik (Kargil). Ali Sher Khan Anchan, &quot;raja&quot; of Khaplu and Shigar, left with a strong army via Marol. Passing the Laddakhi army, he occupied Leh (the capital of Ladakh) and the &quot;raja&quot; of Ladakh was taken prisoner.

Ali Sher Khan Anchan included Gilgit and Chitral in his kingdom of Baltistan, reportedly a flourishing country. The valley from Khepchne to Kachura was flat and fertile, with abundant fruit trees; the sandy desert now extending from Sundus to Skardu Airport was a prosperous town. Skardu had hardly recovered from the shock of the death of Anchan when it was flooded.

In 1840, the region was subjugated by the Dogra rulers of Jammu under the suzerainty of the Sikh Empire. 
On 29 August 2009 the government of Pakistan announced the creation of Gilgit–Baltistan, a provincial autonomous region with Gilgit as its capital and Skardu its largest city.

== Tourism ==

Skardu has several tourist resorts and many natural features, including plains, mountains and mountain-valley lakes. The Deosai plain, Satpara Lake and Basho also host tourists. North of Skardu, the Shigar Valley offers plains, hiking tracks, peaks and campsites. Other valleys in Baltistan region are Khaplu, Rondu, Kachura Lake and Kharmang.

=== Glaciers ===
Baltistan is a rocky wilderness of around , with the largest cluster of mountains in the world and the biggest glaciers outside the polar regions. The Himalayas advance into this region from India, Tibet and Nepal, and north of them are the Karakoram range. Both ranges run northwest, separated by the Indus River. Along the Indus and its tributaries are many valleys. Glaciers include Baltoro Glacier, Biafo Glacier, Siachen Glacier, Trango Glacier and Godwin-Austen Glacier.

=== Mountaineering ===

Baltistan is home to more than 20 peaks of over , including K2 (the second-highest mountain on earth. Other well-known peaks include Masherbrum (also known as K1), Broad Peak, Hidden Peak, Gasherbrum II, Gasherbrum IV and Chogolisa (in the Khaplu Valley). The following peaks have been scaled:

== Demographics ==
The region has a population of about 303,214 as of 2017. It is a blend of ethnic groups, predominantly Baltis, and Tibetans. A few Kashmiris settled in Skardu, practicing agriculture and woodcraft.

== Religion ==
Before the arrival of Islam, Tibetan Buddhism and Bön (to a lesser extent) were the main religions in Baltistan. Buddhism can be traced back to before the formation of the Tibetan Empire in the region during the seventh century. The region has a number of surviving Buddhist archaeological sites. These include the Manthal Buddha Rock, a rock relief of the Buddha at the edge of the village (near Skardu) and the Sacred Rock of Hunza. Nearby are former sites of Buddhist shelters.

Islam was brought to Baltistan by Sufi missionaries during the 16th and 17th centuries, and most of the population converted to Noorbakshia Islam. The scholars were followers of the Kubrawiya Sufi order. Most Noorbakhshi Muslims live in Ghanche.

== Fauna ==
Baltistan has been called a living museum for wildlife. Deosai National Park, in the southern part of the region, is habitat for predators since it has an abundant prey population. Domestic animals include yaks (including hybrid yaks), cattle, sheep, goats, horses and donkeys. Wild animals include ibex, markhor, musk deer, snow leopards, brown and black bears, jackals, foxes, wolves and marmots.

== Culture ==

=== Balti music and art ===

According to Balti folklore, Mughal princess Gul Khatoon (known in Baltistan as Mindoq Gialmo—Flower Queen) brought musicians and artisans with her into the region and they propagated Mughal music and art under her patronage. Musical instruments such as the &quot;surnai&quot;, &quot;karnai&quot;, &quot;dhol&quot; and &quot;chang&quot; were introduced into Baltistan.

==== Dance ====
Classical and other dances are classified as sword dances, &quot;broqchhos&quot; and Yakkha and &quot;ghazal&quot; dances. &quot;Chhogho Prasul&quot; commemorates a victory by the Maqpon &quot;rajas&quot;. As a mark of respect, the musician who plays the drum (&quot;dang&quot;) plays for a long time. A Maqpon princess would occasionally dance to this tune. &quot;Gasho-Pa&quot;, also known as &quot;Ghbus-La-Khorba&quot;, is a sword dance associated with the Gasho Dynasty of Purik (Kargil). &quot;Sneopa&quot;, the marriage-procession dance by &quot;pachones&quot; (twelve &quot;wazirs&quot; who accompany the bride), is performed at the marriage of a &quot;raja&quot;.

=== Architecture ===

Balti architecture has Tibetan and Mughul influences, and its monastic architecture reflects the Buddhist imprint left on the region. Buddhist-style wall paintings can be seen in forts and Noorbakhshi &quot;khanqahs&quot;, including Chaqchan Mosque in Khaplu, Amburik Mosque in Shigar, Khanqah e Muallah Shigar, Khaplu Fort, Shigar Fort and Skardu Fort.

=== Polo ===

Polo is popular in Baltistan, and indigenous to the Karakoram region, having been played there since at least the 15th–16th century. The Maqpon ruler Ali Sher Khan Anchan introduced the game to other valleys during his conquests beyond Gilgit and Chitral. The English word polo derives from the Balti word &quot;polo&quot;, meaning &quot;the ball used in the game of polo&quot;. The game of polo itself is called &quot;Hrthapolo&quot; means horse riding game in Balti.

==Media==
The Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation has radio and television stations in Khaplu that broadcast local programs, and there are a handful of private news outlets. The &quot;Daily K2&quot; is an Urdu newspaper published in Skardu serving Gilgit-Baltistan for long time, and it is the pioneer of print media in Gilgit Baltisatn. &quot;Bad-e-Shimal&quot; claims the largest daily circulation in Gilgit and Baltistan. &quot;Nawa-e-Sufia&quot; is a monthly magazine covering Baltistan&#x27;s Nurbakshi sect.
&quot;5cntv urdu &quot; news web magazine covering Baltistan&#x27;s.

<doc id="539171" wikidata="Q1392093" url="?curid=539171" title="Sunil Gangopadhyay">
<text>Sunil Gangopadhyay or Sunil Ganguly (7 September 1934 – 23 October 2012) was an Indian poet, novelist, short story writer, and critic in the Bengali language. He was one of the foremost poets experimenting with new forms, themes, rhythms, and words in Bengali poetry in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1953, along with Deepak Majumder and Ananda Bagchi, he founded the Bengali poetry magazine, &quot;Krittibas&quot;. He is regarded as one of the most prolific and popular writers in Bengali since Rabindranath Tagore.

He is best known for his novels &quot;Atmaprakash&quot; (1964), &quot;Aranyer Din Ratri&quot;, &quot;Sei Somoy&quot;, &quot;Pratham Alo&quot; (1996), and &quot;Purba Paschim&quot;; travelogues &quot;Payer Tolay Sorshe (Vol. 1 and 2)&quot;; the poetry collections &quot;Eka ebong Koekjon&quot; (1958), &quot;Ami Ki Rokom Vabe Beche Achi&quot; (1966), and &quot;Hathat Nirar Janya&quot;. Sunil Gangopadhyay introduced the fictional character &quot;Kakababu&quot;, writing 36 novels in the series that became influential in Bengali children&#x27;s literature. In 1985, he received the prestigious &quot;Sahitya Akademi&quot; award for his historical fiction &quot;Those Days&quot; (&quot;Sei Somoy&quot;). 

His prose style, conversational and colloquial, simple and lucid yet deeply penetrating with often a thin layer of dry humor, has by now created a niche of its own which have influenced many later writers, not only in Bengal but elsewhere too. Sunil, according to Shankha Ghosh, &quot;used to narrate the story using contemporary language, which often allows readers to find aspects of themselves they may have not seen, perhaps did not want to see. In doing so, Sunil skillfully turned his personal confession into a shared experience for a wide readership.&quot; Sitanshu Yashaschandra observed that in his works &quot;the personal is never sacrificed in favor of the &#x27;regional,&#x27; nor is &#x27;Bengaliness&#x27; ever given up to aspire for any larger status. He is a writer of international stature, simply because he is a writer, such a good writer.&quot;

==Early life==
He was born in Madaripur in a Bengali Hindu family which is now in Bangladesh. At an early age, he moved to Kolkata from his ancestral town, which became part of East Pakistan after the 1947 Partition of India. He studied at the Surendranath College, Dum Dum Motijheel College, City College, Kolkata – all affiliated with the University of Calcutta. Thereafter, he obtained his master&#x27;s degree in Bengali from the University of Calcutta in 1954.

He married Swati Banerjee on 26 February 1967. Their only son, Souvik, who stays in Boston, was born on 20 November 1967.

==Literary career==

===Krittibas===
Gangopadhyay was the founder editor of &quot;Krittibas&quot;, a seminal poetry magazine started publishing from 1953, that became a platform for a new generation of poets experimenting with many new forms in poetic themes, rhythms, and words.

===Other works===
Later, he started writing for various publications of the Ananda Bazar group, a major publishing house in Kolkata and has been continuing it for many years. He became a friend of the beat poet Allen Ginsberg while he was travelling in India. Ginsberg mentioned Gangopadhyay most notedly in his poem &quot;September on Jessore Road.&quot; Gangopadhyay in return mentioned Ginsberg in some of his prose work. After serving five years as the Vice President, he was elected the President of the Sahitya Akademi on 20 February 2008.

Sunil, along with Tarun Sanyal, Jyotirmoy Datta and Satrajit Dutta had volunteered to be defence witnesses in the famous trial of Hungry generation movement poet Malay Roy Choudhury.

==Works==

Author of well over 200 books, Sunil was a prolific writer who has excelled in different genres but declares poetry to be his &quot;first love&quot;. His &quot;Nikhilesh&quot; and &quot;Neera&quot; series of poems (some of which have been translated as &quot;For You, Neera&quot; and &quot;Murmur in the Woods&quot;) have been extremely popular.

As in poetry, Sunil was known for his unique style in prose. His first novel was &quot;&quot;Atmaprakash&quot;&quot; and it was also the first writing from a newcomer in literature published in the prestigious magazine – &quot;Desh&quot; (1965). It was critically acclaimed but some controversy arose for its aggressive and &#x27;obscene&#x27; style. Sunil said that he was afraid of this novel and went away from Calcutta for a few days.. In an interview session with acclaimed film director Rituparno Ghosh, Sunil Gangopadhyay said that before his marriage, his brother in law after reading the novel &#x27;Atmaprakash&#x27; was shocked and thought that Sunil Gangopadhyay was not a good match for his sister. Satyajit Ray thought to make a film on it but it wasn&#x27;t possible for reasons. The central character of &quot;Atmaprakash&quot; is a young man of core-calcutta&#x27;- Sunil, who leads a bohemian life-style. The novel had inspiration from &quot;On the road&quot; by Jack Kerouac, the beat generation writer. His historical fiction &quot;Sei Somoy&quot; (translated into English by Aruna Chakravorty as &quot;Those Days&quot;) received the Indian Sahitya Akademi award in 1985. &quot;Sei Somoy&quot; continues to be a best seller more than two decades after its first publication. The same is true for &quot;Prothom Alo&quot; (also translated recently by Aruna Chakravorty as &quot;First Light&quot;), another best selling historical fiction and &quot;Poorba-Pashchim&quot;, a raw depiction of the partition and its aftermath seen through the eyes of three generations of Bengalis in West Bengal, Bangladesh and elsewhere. He is also the winner of the Bankim Puraskar (1982), and the Ananda Puraskar (twice, in 1972 and 1989).

Sunil wrote in many other genres including travelogues, children&#x27;s fiction, short stories, features, and essays. Among his pen-names are: Nil Lohit, Sanatan Pathak, and Nil Upadhyay.

Though he wrote all types of children&#x27;s fiction, one character created by him that stands out above the rest, was Kakababu, the crippled adventurist, accompanied by his young adult nephew Santu, and his friend Jojo. Since 1974, Sunil Gangopadhyay wrote over 35 novels of this popular series, most of which appeared in Anandamela magazine.

==Death==
Sunil Gangopadhyay died at 2:05 am on 23 October 2012 at his South Kolkata residence, following a heart attack. He was suffering from prostate cancer for some time and went to Mumbai for treatment. He returned to Kolkata on the day of &quot;Mahalaya&quot;. Although he was a communist and an atheist. Controversially, Gangopadhyay&#x27;s body was cremated following Hindu custom on 25 October at Keoratola crematorium with several dignitaries and numerous fans paying their last tributes. Ganguly was not a Hindu or Muslim but a committed atheist.

Indian President Pranab Mukherjee condoled the death of Gangopadhyay saying:
Gangopadhyay had enriched Bengali literature through his unique style. He was one of the best intellectuals among his contemporaries. The vacuum created by his death cannot be filled.

Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the former Chief Minister of West Bengal, who was closely associated with the writer since 1964, said that Bengali literature would remain indebted to him.

== Controversies ==

* In 1970 Satyajit Ray&#x27;s film &quot;Pratidwandi&quot; released which was based on Gangopadhyay&#x27;s novel. In the novel Gangopadhyay depicted how a poor nurse used to entertain men for some &quot;moolah&quot;. This arose controversy and nurses across the city of Kolkata protested against such depiction.
* In 2006 novel &quot;Ardhek Jibon&quot;, he expressed his carnal desire for Hindu goddess Saraswati created some controversies. A retired IPS officer lodged a case against Gangopadhyay in the Calcutta High Court. Against this controversy Gangpadhyay felt– he had no freedom to express what he felt. Another Bengali writer Buddhadeb Guha found this a cheap gimmick and he told– &quot;I don&#x27;t support such cheap gimmicks. An author should set an example for the younger generations. If an author thinks it&#x27;s cool to say that he loves to booze and enjoys going to Sonagachhi, then this only speaks poorly of him.&quot;
* In September 2012 Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasreen accused Sunil Gangopadhyay of sexually harassing her and other women. She also alleged that Gangopadhyay was involved in banning her novel &quot;Dwikhandito&quot; and her &quot;banishment&quot; from West Bengal.

<doc id="539184" wikidata="Q2805655" url="?curid=539184" title="Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery">
<text>Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery KT PC FRS (28 July 1674 – 28 August 1731) was an English nobleman, statesman and patron of the sciences.

==Early life==
The second son of Roger Boyle, 2nd Earl of Orrery, and his wife Lady Mary Sackville (1647–1710), daughter of Richard Sackville, 5th Earl of Dorset, he was born at Little Chelsea, London. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, and soon distinguished himself by his learning and abilities.

==Career==
Like the first earl, he was an author, soldier and statesman. He translated Plutarch&#x27;s life of Lysander, and published an edition of the epistles of Phalaris, which engaged him in the famous controversy with Bentley. He was a member of the Irish Parliament and sat for Charleville between 1695 and 1699. He was three times member for the town of Huntingdon; and on the death of his brother, Lionel, 3rd earl, in 1703, he succeeded to the title.

In 1706, he married Lady Elizabeth Cecil, daughter of John Cecil, 5th Earl of Exeter and Lady Anne Cavendish, at Burghley House. Their son and heir, John, was born the following year.

He entered the army, and in 1709 was raised to the rank of major-general, and sworn one of Her Majesty&#x27;s Privy Council. He was appointed to the Order of the Thistle and appointed queen&#x27;s envoy to the states of Brabant and Flanders; and having discharged this trust with ability, he was created an English peer, as Baron Boyle of Marston, in Somerset. He inherited the estate in 1714.

Boyle became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1706. In 1713, under the patronage of Boyle, clockmaker George Graham created the first mechanical Solar System model that could demonstrate proportional motion of the planets around the Sun. The device was named the orrery in the Earl&#x27;s honour.

Charles Boyle received several additional honours in the reign of George I; but having had the misfortune to fall under the suspicion of the government for playing a part in the Jacobite Atterbury Plot, he was committed to the Tower in 1722, where he remained six months, and was then admitted to bail. On a subsequent inquiry, he was discharged.

Boyle wrote a comedy, &quot;As You Find It&quot;, printed in 1703 and later published together with the plays of the first earl.

In 1728, he was listed as one of the subscribers to the &quot;Cyclopaedia&quot; of Ephraim Chambers.

==Later life==
Boyle died at his house in Westminster in 1731 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. He bequeathed his personal library and collection of scientific instruments to Christ Church Library; the instruments are now on display in the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford.

His son John, the 5th Earl of Orrery, succeeded to the earldom of Cork on the failure of the elder branch of the Boyle family, as earl of Cork and Orrery.

<text>Gilgit (; Shina: ; ) is a city in Pakistani-administered Gilgit–Baltistan in the disputed Kashmir region. It is the capital of the Gilgit-Baltistan region. The city is located in a broad valley near the confluence of the Gilgit and the Hunza rivers. It is a major tourist destination in Pakistan, serving as a hub for trekking and mountaineering expeditions in the Karakoram mountain range.

Gilgit was once a major centre for Buddhism; it was an important stop on the ancient Silk Road, and today serves as a major junction along the Karakoram Highway with road connections to China as well as the Pakistani cities of Skardu, Chitral, Peshawar, and Islamabad. Currently, it serves as a frontier station for the local tribal areas. The city&#x27;s economic activity is mainly focused on agriculture, with wheat, maize, and barley as the main produced crops.

==Etymology==
The city&#x27;s ancient name was &quot;Sargin&quot;, later to be known as &quot;Gilit&quot;, and it is still referred to as &quot;Gilit&quot; or &quot;Sargin-Gilit&quot; by the local people. The native Khowar and Wakhi-speaking people refer to the city as &quot;Gilt&quot;, and in Burushaski, it is called &quot;Geelt&quot;.

==History==
===Early history===
Brokpas trace their settlement from Gilgit into the fertile villages of Ladakh through a rich corpus of hymns, songs, and folklore that have been passed down through generations. The Dards and Shinas appear in many of the old Pauranic lists of people who lived in the region, with the former also mentioned in Ptolemy&#x27;s accounts of the region.

===Buddhist era===

Gilgit was an important city on the Silk Road, along which Buddhism spread from South Asia to the rest of Asia. It is considered a Buddhism corridor, along which many Chinese monks came to Kashmir, to learn and to preach Buddhism. Two famous Chinese Buddhist pilgrims, Faxian and Xuanzang, traversed Gilgit, according to their accounts.


According to Chinese records, in the 600s and 700s, the city was governed by a Buddhist dynasty referred to as &quot;Little Balur&quot; or &quot;Lesser Bolü&quot; (). They are believed to have been the Patola Shahis dynasty mentioned in a Brahmi inscription, and are devout adherents of Vajrayana Buddhism.

In mid-600s, Gilgit came under Chinese suzerainty after the fall of the Western Turkic Khaganate to the Tang military campaigns in the region. In the late 600s CE, the rising Tibetan Empire wrested control of the region from the Chinese. However, faced with growing influence of the Umayyad Caliphate and then the Abbasid Caliphate to the west, the Tibetans were forced to ally themselves with the Islamic caliphates. The region was then contested by the Chinese and Tibetan forces, and their respective vassal states, until the mid-700s. Chinese records of the region continue until late the 700s, at which time the Tangs&#x27; western military campaign was weakened due to the An Lushan Rebellion.

Control of the region was left to the Tibetan Empire. They referred to the region as Bruzha, a toponym that is consistent with the ethnonym &quot;Burusho&quot; used today. Tibetan control of the region lasted until the late 800s CE.

====Gilgit manuscripts====
This corpus of manuscripts was discovered in 1931 in Gilgit, containing many Buddhist texts such as four sutras from the Buddhist canon, including the famous Lotus Sutra. The manuscripts were written on birch bark in the Buddhist form of Sanskrit in the Sharada script. They cover a wide range of themes such as iconometry, folk tales, philosophy, medicine and several related areas of life and general knowledge.

The Gilgit manuscripts
are included in the UNESCO Memory of the World register. They are among the oldest manuscripts in the world, and the oldest manuscript collection surviving in Pakistan, having major significance in Buddhist studies and the evolution of Asian and Sanskrit literature. The manuscripts are believed to have been written in the 5th to 6th centuries AD, though more manuscripts were discovered from the succeeding centuries, which were also classified as Gilgit manuscripts.

Many of the original manuscripts from Gilgit can be found in the National Archives of India and the Pratap Singh Museum in Srinagar. Two manuscripts collected by the orientalist Sir Aurel Stein are in the British Library in London. They include a rare paper version of the Lotus Sutra.

As of 6 October 2014, one source claims that the part of the collection deposited at the Sri Pratap Singh Museum in Srinagar was irrecoverably destroyed during the 2014 India–Pakistan floods.

===Pre-Trakhàn===

===Trakhàn Dynasty===

Gilgit was ruled for centuries by the local Trakhàn Dynasty, which ended about 1810 with the death of Raja Abas, the last Trakhàn Raja. The rulers of Hunza and Nager also claim origin with the Trakhàn dynasty. They claim descent from a heroic Kayani Prince of Persia, &quot;Azur Jamshid&quot; (also known as &quot;Shamsher&quot;), who secretly married the daughter of the king &quot;Shri Badat&quot;.

She conspired with him to overthrow her cannibal father. Sri Badat&#x27;s faith is theorised as Hindu by some and Buddhist by others.

Prince Azur Jamshid succeeded in overthrowing King Badat who was known as the &quot;Adam Khor&quot; (literally &quot;man-eater&quot;), often demanding a child a day from his subjects, his demise is still celebrated to this very day by locals in traditional annual celebrations. In the beginning of the new year, where a Juniper procession walks along the river, in memory of chasing the cannibal king &quot;Sri Badat&quot; away.

Azur Jamshid abdicated after 16 years of rule in favour of his wife &quot;Nur Bakht Khatùn&quot; until their son and heir &quot;Garg&quot;, grew of age and assumed the title of Raja and ruled, for 55 years. The dynasty flourished under the name of the Kayani dynasty until 1421 when Raja Torra Khan assumed rulership. He ruled as a memorable king until 1475. He distinguished his family line from his stepbrother &quot;Shah Rais Khan&quot; (who fled to the king of Badakshan, and with whose help he gained Chitral from &quot;Raja Torra Khan&quot;), as the now-known dynastic name of Trakhàn. The descendants of &quot;Shah Rais Khan&quot; were known as the &quot;Ra&#x27;issiya Dynasty&quot;.

===1800s===
The area had been a flourishing tract but prosperity was destroyed by warfare over the next fifty years, and by the great flood of 1841 in which the river Indus was blocked by a landslip below the Hatu Pir and the valley was turned into a lake. After the death of Abas, Sulaiman Shah, Raja of Yasin, conquered Gilgit. Then, Azad Khan, Raja of Punial, killed Sulaiman Shah, taking Gilgit; then Tahir Shah, Raja of Buroshall (Nagar), took Gilgit and killed Azad Khan.

Tair Shah&#x27;s son Shah Sakandar inherited, only to be killed by Gohar Aman, ethnic Kho Raja of Yasin of the Khushwakhte Dynasty when he took Gilgit. Then in 1842, Shah Sakandar&#x27;s brother, Karim Khan, expelled Yasin rulers with the support of a Sikh army from Kashmir. The Sikh general, Nathu Shah, left garrison troops and Karim Khan ruled until Gilgit was ceded to Gulab Singh of Jammu and Kashmir in 1846 by the Treaty of Amritsar, and Dogra troops replaced the Sikh in Gilgit.

Nathu Shah and Karim Khan both transferred their allegiance to Gulab Singh, continuing local administration. When Hunza attacked in 1848, both of them were killed. Gilgit fell to the Hunza and their Yasin and Punial allies but was soon reconquered by Gulab Singh&#x27;s Dogra troops. With the support of Raja Gohar Aman, Gilgit&#x27;s inhabitants drove their new rulers out in an uprising in 1852. Raja Gohar Aman then ruled Gilgit until his death in 1860, just before new Dogra forces from Ranbir Singh, son of Gulab Singh, captured the fort and town.

In the 1870s Chitral was threatened by Afghans, Maharaja Ranbir Singh was firm in protecting Chitral from Afghans, the Mehtar of Chitral asked for help. In 1876 Chitral accepted the authority of Jammu Clan and in reverse get the protection from the Dogras who have in the past took part in many victories over Afghans during the time of Gulab Singh Dogra.

===British Raj===

In 1877, in order to guard against the advance of Russia, the British India Government, acting as the suzerain power of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, established the Gilgit Agency. The Agency was re-established under control of the British Resident in Jammu and Kashmir. It comprised the Gilgit Wazarat; the State of Hunza and Nagar; the Punial Jagir; the Governorships of Yasin, Kuh-Ghizr and Ishkoman, and Chilas.

The Tajiks of Xinjiang sometimes enslaved the Gilgiti and Kunjuti Hunza.

In 1935, the British India government demanded from the Jammu and Kashmir state to lease them Gilgit town plus most of the Gilgit Agency and the hill-states Hunza, Nagar, Yasin and Ishkoman for 60 years.

Abdullah Sahib was an Arain and belonged to Chimkor Sahib village of Ambala district Punjab, British India. Abdullah Sahib was the first Muslim governor of the Gilgit in British time period and was close associate of Maharaja Partap Singh.

Khan Bahadur Kalay Khan, a Mohammed Zai Pathan, was the Governor of Gilgit Hunza and Kashmir before partition.

===1947 Kashmir war===

On 26 October 1947, Maharaja Hari Singh of Jammu and Kashmir, faced with a tribal invasion by Pakistan due to Masscre of Muslims in Jammu by Hindus and Sikh mobs, signed the Instrument of Accession, joining India. The tribal invasion by Pakistan was not simply a tribal invasion. Pakistani Major General Akbar Khan has given account of the invasion in his book &quot;Raiders in Kashmir&quot;. General Akbar Khan, then serving as a colonel in the Pakistan army, has described at least four meetings with Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan to discuss the planning and conduct of the operations. Justice Muhammad Yusuf Saraf, at the time a Muslim Conference activist, has pointed out that such a major operation could not have been launched without Jinnah&#x27;s knowledge and approval. The &#x27;Azad Forces&#x27; that were part of the so-called tribal invasion were led by Pakistan army officers, and the UNCIP report records Pakistan&#x27;s admission that they were under Pakistan&#x27;s &#x27;tactical command&#x27;.

Gilgit&#x27;s military leaders did not favour the State&#x27;s accession to India. However, there was also written evidence of Gilgit troop leaders wanting to set up an independent Islamic state. Major William Brown in his book Gilgit Rebellion describes the Gilgit troop leaders stating, &quot;&quot;We know of course that you are loyal to Pakistan-all Britishers are-but it is not our intention to join Pakistan. We intend to set up an independent Islamic State called the United States of Gilgit, and although we shall keep the friendliest relation with Pakistan we shall in no way owe allegiance to that dominion&quot;.&quot; The military leaders of the Frontier Districts Province (modern day Gilgit-Baltistan) wanted to join Pakistan. Sensing their discontent, Major William Brown, the Maharaja&#x27;s commander of the Gilgit Scouts, mutinied on 1 November 1947, overthrowing the Governor Ghansara Singh. The bloodless &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot; was planned by Brown to the last detail under the code name &quot;Datta Khel&quot;, which was also joined by a rebellious section of the Jammu and Kashmir 6th Infantry under Mirza Hassan Khan. Brown ensured that the treasury was secured and minorities were protected. A provisional government (&quot;Aburi Hakoomat&quot;) was established by the Gilgit locals with Raja Shah Rais Khan as the president and Mirza Hassan Khan as the commander-in-chief. However, Major Brown had already telegraphed Khan Abdul Qayyum Khan asking Pakistan to take over. The Pakistani political agent, Khan Mohammad Alam Khan, arrived on 16 November and took over the administration of Gilgit. Brown outmaneuvered the pro-Independence group and secured the approval of the mirs and rajas for accession to Pakistan. Browns&#x27;s actions surprised the British Government.

The provisional government lasted 16 days. The provisional government lacked sway over the population. The Gilgit rebellion did not have civilian involvement and was solely the work of military leaders, not all of whom had been in favor of joining Pakistan, at least in the short term. Historian Ahmed Hasan Dani mentions that although there was lack of public participation in the rebellion, sentiments were intense in the civilian population and their anti-Kashmiri sentiments were also clear. According to various scholars, the people of Gilgit as well as those of Chilas, Koh Ghizr, Ishkoman, Yasin, Punial, Hunza and Nagar joined Pakistan by choice.

==Geography==

Gilgit is situated in a valley formed by the confluence of the Indus River, Hunza River, Astore River and Gilgit River.

===Climate===
Gilgit experiences a cold desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWk&quot;). Weather conditions for Gilgit are dominated by its geographical location, a valley in a mountainous area, southwest of Karakoram range. The prevalent season of Gilgit is winter, occupying the valley eight to nine months a year.

Gilgit lacks significant rainfall, averaging in annually, as monsoon breaks against the southern range of Himalayas. Irrigation for land cultivation is obtained from the rivers, abundant with melting snow water from higher altitudes.

The summer season is brief and hot, with daily high temperatures occasionally peaking at over . As a result of this extremity in the weather, landslides and avalanches are frequent in the area.
===Climate Change Effects===

Climate change has adversely effected this region with more rains every year. On 26 August 2022, most villages in Ghizer district and Hunza were severely effected by the ongoing flooding displacing many people.

==Administration==
The city of Gilgit constitutes a tehsil within Gilgit District. Gilgit District itself is the part of the larger Gilgit Division which is headed by a Commissioner of BPS-20 belonging to Pakistan Administrative service. The Current Commissioner Gilgit Division is Mr Najeem Alam (PAS).

==Transportation==

===Air===
Gilgit is served by the nearby Gilgit Airport, with direct flights to Islamabad. Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) is the only airline operating in Gilgit. The Government of Pakistan is planning to build a new international standard airport in Gilgit to meet the requirements of international tourists and demand from domestic investors.

===Road===

Gilgit is located approximately from the Karakoram Highway (KKH). The roadway is being upgraded as part of the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor. The KKH connects Gilgit to Chilas, Dasu, Besham, Mansehra, Abbottabad and Islamabad in the south. Gilgit is connected to Karimabad (Hunza) and Sust in the north, with further connections to the Chinese cities of Tashkurgan, Upal and Kashgar in Xinjiang. Gilgit is also linked to Chitral in the west, and Skardu to the east. The road to Skardu will be upgraded to a 4-lane road at a cost of $475 million.

Transport companies such as the Silk Route Transport Pvt, Masherbrum Transport Pvt and Northern Areas Transport Corporation (NATCO ), offer passenger road transport between Islamabad, Gilgit, Sust, and Kashgar and Tashkurgan in China.

The Astore-Burzil Pass Road, linking Gilgit to Srinagar was closed in 1978.
===Rail===
Gilgit is not served by any rail connections. Long-term plans for the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor call for construction of the long Khunjerab Railway, which is expected to be completed in 2030, that would also serve Gilgit.

==Education==
* Karakoram International University Gilgit

==Basic facilities==

Gilgit has not received a gas pipeline infrastructure since Pakistan&#x27;s independence, unlike other cities. Through the importation of gas cylinders from other provinces, many private gas contractors offer gas cylinders. The LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) Air Mix Plant project by Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited was unveiled in 2020, with the goal of bringing the gas facility to Gilgit. This will significantly reduce deforestation, as the public now uses wood from trees for heating and lighting purpose. The first head office has been built in Gilgit.

<doc id="539202" wikidata="Q366040" url="?curid=539202" title="Stefan Żeromski">
<text>Stefan Żeromski ( ; 14 October 1864 – 20 November 1925) was a Polish novelist and dramatist belonging to the Young Poland movement at the turn of the 20th century. He was called the &quot;conscience of Polish literature&quot;.

He also wrote under the pen names Maurycy Zych, Józef Katerla, and Stefan Iksmoreż.

He was nominated four times for the Nobel Prize in Literature.

== Life ==

Stefan Żeromski was born on 14 October 1864 at Strawczyn, near Kielce.

On 2 September 1892, he married a widow, Oktawia Rodkiewicz, &quot;née&quot; Radziwiłłowicz, whom he had met at a spa in Nałęczów, co-owned by her stepfather. One of the witnesses at the wedding was the novelist Bolesław Prus, an admirer of Oktawia&#x27;s who had not been in favor of the marriage.

The newlyweds moved to Switzerland, where Żeromski worked from 1892 to 1896 as a librarian at the Polish National Museum in Rapperswil . At Oktawia&#x27;s request Prus, though no admirer of Żeromski&#x27;s writings, helped the struggling couple as much as he could.

In 1913 Żeromski started a new family with the painter Anna Zawadzka, whom he had met in 1908; they had a daughter, Monika.

In 1924, in recognition of Żeromski&#x27;s achievements, President Stanisław Wojciechowski gave him a three-room apartment on the second floor of Warsaw&#x27;s Royal Castle.

In the same year, Żeromski was shortlisted for the Nobel Prize in literature.

He died on 20 November 1925 in Warsaw.

<doc id="539225" wikidata="Q1345535" url="?curid=539225" title="Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery">
<text>Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery, 25 April 1621 to 16 October 1679, was an Anglo-Irish soldier and politician. A younger son of the Earl of Cork, the largest landowner in Munster, like many Irish Protestants he supported the Dublin Castle administration during the Irish Confederate Wars, a related conflict of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. 

Boyle was noted for his anti-Catholicism, and consistently opposed concessions to Irish Catholics. A skilled politician, he believed maintaining the Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland required support from the ruling government in London, whatever its composition. As a result, he held senior positions under the Commonwealth and Charles II, following the 1660 Stuart Restoration. 

A noted writer on 17th-century warfare, Boyle helped design Charles Fort outside Kinsale. He also produced a number of plays and poems, which were well regarded by contemporaries but have since faded into obscurity. 

==Personal details==
Roger Boyle was born 25 April 1625, twelfth born and third surviving son of Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork (1566–1643), and his second wife, Catherine Fenton Boyle (1588–1630). A few months before his 7th birthday, his father granted him the Broghill estate in County Cork, and he was created Baron of Broghill in the Peerage of Ireland. 

His parents had a total of fifteen children, ten of whom survived into adulthood. The most notable included his eldest brother Richard (1612–1698), Katherine (1615–1691), a member of the Hartlib Circle, Mary Rich, Countess of Warwick (1624–1678), and the chemist Robert Boyle (1627–1691).

In January 1641, he married Lady Margaret Howard (1623–1689), a daughter of the Earl of Suffolk. Their joyful wedding was immortalised in verse by Sir John Suckling as &quot;A Ballad upon a Wedding&quot;. The couple had five daughters and two sons, his heir Roger (1646–1682), and Henry (1648–1693), father of the Earl of Shannon. His eldest daughter, Margaret (1644–1683), married Folliott Wingfield, 1st Viscount Powerscourt. 

==Career==
Boyle entered Trinity College, Dublin in 1630, then moved to London in 1632, where he briefly attended law school at Gray&#x27;s Inn in March 1636. He and his elder brother Lewis (1619–1642) spent the next three years traveling in Europe, where they studied languages, mathematics and military theory. When the two returned to England in 1639, their father encouraged them to serve Charles I in the Bishops&#x27; Wars against the Covenanters. 

==Rebellion and civil war==
Boyle returned to Ireland on the outbreak of the rebellion in 1641 and fought with his brothers against the Irish rebels at the battle of Liscarroll in September 1642. Boyle and in Ireland were left vulnerable by the outbreak of the First English Civil War. Although initially under the command of the Royalist Marquis of Ormonde (later James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde), Lord Broghill consented to serve under the parliamentary commissioners in Cork against the Irish Confederates. Boyle fought with the Parliamentarians until the execution of the king, when he retired altogether from public affairs and took up his residence at Marston in Somerset.

Subsequently, he originated a scheme to bring about the Restoration. On his way abroad to consult with King Charles II, he was unexpectedly visited by Oliver Cromwell in London. Cromwell informed him that his plans were well known to the council and warned against persisting in them. Cromwell offered him a command in Ireland against the rebels that entailed no obligation except faithful service. It was accepted.

Boyle&#x27;s assistance in Ireland proved invaluable during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. Appointed master of the ordnance, he soon assembled a body of infantry and horse, driving the rebels into Kilkenny, where they surrendered; he induced the Royalist garrison of Cork (English troops with whom he had served earlier in the wars) to defect back to the Parliamentarian side. On 10 May 1650, he completely defeated at Macroom a force of Irish advancing to the relief of Cork. On Cromwell&#x27;s departure for Scotland, Boyle cooperated with Henry Ireton, whom he joined at the siege of Limerick. In 1651 he defeated an Irish force marching to Limerick&#x27;s relief under Lord Muskerry at the battle of Knocknaclashy, the final battle of the Irish Confederate Wars, thus effecting the capture of the town.

By this time Broghill had become a fast friend and follower of Cromwell, whose stern measures in Ireland and support of the English and Protestants were welcomed after the policy of concession to the Irish initiated by Charles I. He was returned as member for the county of Cork in 1654 to the First Protectorate Parliament and in 1656 to the Second Protectorate Parliament and also in the latter assembly for Edinburgh, for which he elected to sit. He served this year as Lord President of the Council in Scotland, where he won much popularity. He lodged in Edinburgh at Old Moray House. When he returned to England he was included in the inner cabinet of Cromwell&#x27;s council, and nominated in 1657 as a member of the new House of Lords. He was one of those most in favour of Cromwell&#x27;s assumption of the royal title, and proposed a union between the Protector&#x27;s daughter Frances and Charles II.

==Restoration==
On Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s death, Boyle gave his support to Richard Cromwell; but as he saw no possibility of maintaining the government, he left for Ireland, whereby resuming command in Munster he secured the island for Charles, anticipating Monk&#x27;s overtures by inviting the King to land at Cork. In 1660, he was elected MP for Arundel in the Convention Parliament, although he was busily engaged in Ireland at the time of the election. On 5 September 1660 he was created Earl of Orrery. The same year he was appointed one of the three Lord Justices (Ireland) and drew up the Act of Settlement 1662. In 1661, he was re-elected MP for Arundel in the Cavalier Parliament. He founded the town of Charleville, County Cork, near his estate at Broghill. However, his mansion house in Broghill was burned down by Irish forces before the end of the century.

He continued to exercise his office as lord-president of Munster till 1668, when he resigned it on account of disputes with the duke of Ormonde, the lord-lieutenant. On 25 November, he was impeached by the House of Commons for &quot;raising of money by his own authority upon his majesty&#x27;s subjects,&quot; but the prorogation of parliament by the king interrupted the proceedings, which were not afterwards renewed. In 1673 he was appointed Custos Rotulorum of County Limerick, which position he held until his death.

==Boyle&#x27;s writings==

In addition to Lord Orrery&#x27;s achievements as a statesman and administrator, he gained some reputation as a writer and a dramatist. He was the author of:
*&quot;An Answer to a Scandalous Letter ... A Full Discovery of the Treachery of the Irish Rebels&quot; (1662), printed with the letter itself in his &quot;State Letters&quot; (1742)
*Another answer to the same letter entitled &quot;Irish Colors Displayed ...&quot; also ascribed to him
*&quot;Parthenissa&quot;, a novel (1651, 1654–56, 1669)
*&quot;English-Adventures by a Person of Honor&quot; (1676), from which Otway drew his tragedy of the &quot;Orphan&quot;
*&quot;A Treatise of the Art of War&quot; (1677), a work of considerable historical value

There are some poems, of little interest, including verses:
*&quot;On His Majesty&#x27;s Happy Restoration&quot; (unprinted)
*&quot;On the Death of Abraham Cowley&quot; (1677)
*&quot;The Dream&quot; (unprinted)
*&quot;Poems on most of the Festivals of the Church&quot; (1681)
Plays in verse, of some literary but less dramatic merit:
*&quot;Henry V&quot; (1664), heroic drama
*&quot;The Generall&quot; (1664), a tragi-comedy. Samuel Pepys, 4 October 1664, called it &quot;so dull and so ill-acted, that I think it is the worst I ever saw or heard in all my days.&quot;
*&quot;Mustapha&quot; (1665), tragedy
*&quot;Tryphon : a tragedy&quot; (acted 1668, Printed for H. Herringman, 1669)
*&quot;The Black Prince&quot; (acted 1667; printed 1669), heroic drama
*&quot;Herod the Great&quot; (published 1694 but unacted), tragedy
*&quot;Altemira&quot; (1702), tragedy
*&quot;Guzman&quot; (1669), comedy
*&quot;Mr. Anthony&quot; (1690), comedy

A collected edition was published in 1737, to which was added the fourth earl&#x27;s comedy &quot;As you find it&quot;. &quot;The General&quot; is also attributed to him.

<text>Hill Head is a residential area and village on the coast of the Solent. It is located south of Stubbington, west of Lee-on-the-Solent and south east of Titchfield, in the borough of Fareham, Hampshire. 

==Governance==
Hill Head is in the Gosport parliamentary constituency. The MP is Caroline Dinenage of the Conservative Party since 2010. 

==Geography==
Hill Head has a sandy beach with sailing, windsurfing, kitesurfing and fishing being the most popular pastimes upon its shores. There is also a small harbour, located where the River Meon enters the Solent. It is next to Titchfield Haven National Nature Reserve.

Hill Head has a substantial elderly population – 33.2% of its 7,100 residents are over 65, compared to an English average of 18.4%. At the 2021 Census the ward population had fallen slightly to 7,100.

==History==
During World War II, Hill Head was one of many loading zones for the D-Day invasions and the area was inundated with allied troops. Along the coast here there are still many reminders of the war time activities including remnants of fortifications. Part of a Mulberry harbour broke away and was grounded at Hill Head beach. It remained there for many years. Seafield Park, a Royal Navy establishment was nearby.

The Swordfish public house at Hill Head was demolished in 2004 to make way for a small development of beach-front homes known as Swordfish Close. The name Swordfish is derived from the World War Two bomber the Fairey Swordfish which flew from the nearby airfield at RNAS Lee-on-Solent (HMS Daedalus). Swordfish Close has been featured in the BBC television series &quot;Seaside Rescue&quot;. The pub was previously called the Marine Court Hotel.

For many years the only remaining pub along Hill Head beach-front was the Osborne View, so named as Osborne House (residential home of Queen Victoria) was visible on a clear day. It burnt down in a fire that started at 2.30am on 22 February 2024. Built in the Victorian era and constructed down the cliff over four floors, the Osborne View was a hotel until 1971; regulars included football player and manager Alf Ramsey.

Between 1985 and 1990, Hill Head&#x27;s beaches appeared in the BBC TV show &quot;Howards&#x27; Way&quot;, which was mostly filmed at nearby Bursledon, Hamble-le-Rice, Warsash and Swanwick.

==Transport==
Bus services to and from Hill Head are provided by First, with a half-hourly circular service to and from Fareham.

==Amenities==
The area has a convenience store with a post office, a lighting shop, a door and windows shop, two hairdressers, a Chinese takeaway and a prep school.

<text>François de Harlay de Champvallon (; François III de Harlay; 14 August 1625 – 6 August 1695) was the fifth Archbishop of Paris.

==Life and church==

===Early years===
Harlay de Champvallon was born in Paris, the nephew of François de Harlay, archbishop of Rouen. He was presented to the abbey of Jumièges immediately on leaving the Collège de Navarre, and he was only twenty-six when he succeeded his uncle in the archiepiscopal see. He was transferred to the see of Paris in 1671. In 1674 the domain and lordships of Saint-Cloud, Maisons-Alfort, Créteil, Ozoir-la-Ferrière, and Armentières-en-Brie were erected into a duchy of Saint-Cloud to be held by the successive Archbishops of Paris, although it was not registered in the parlement until 1690. Harlay was the first to bear the title, which was then held by his successors at Paris till the Revolution. The Duke was likewise a &quot;pair&quot; of France. Harlay was also commander of the chivalric Order of the Holy Spirit and a member of the Académie française. In 1690 he was proposed by the king for the cardinalate, though this did not have effect.

===Career===
During the early part of his political career he was a firm adherent of Mazarin, and is said to have helped to procure his return from exile. His private life gave rise to much scandal, but he had considerable learning, was an eloquent and persuasive speaker and had a great capacity for business. He secured the favour of Louis XIV by his support for the claims of the Gallican Church formulated by the declaration made by the clergy in assembly on 19 March 1682, when Bossuet accused him of truckling to the court like a valet.

Though no official act has survived, it is reliably thought that Harlay officiated in a private ceremony at the king&#x27;s marriage with Madame de Maintenon after a Mass celebrated by Père la Chaise, the king&#x27;s confessor, and in the presence of only three witnesses, the Marquis de Montchevreuil, the Chevalier de Forbin and Alexandre Bontemps. Harlay was hated by the bride for using his influence with the king to keep the matter secret.

He had a weekly audience of Louis XIV in company with Père la Chaise on the affairs of the Church in Paris, but his influence gradually declined, and Saint-Simon, who bore him no good will for his harsh attitude to the Jansenists, says that his friends deserted him as the royal favour waned, until at last most of his time was spent at his Château de Conflans (in Charenton-le-Pont) in the company of Paule-Françoise de Gondi, duchess of Lesdiguieres, who alone was faithful to him. Saint-Simon records that they were fond of walking through the magnificent gardens there, while a servant followed at a respectful distance to rake the gravel disturbed by their feet.

Harlay urged the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes and this took place in 1685. As a result, Dieppe, of which he was temporal and spiritual lord, saw 3,000 of its Huguenot citizens flee abroad, partly it is said on account of Harlay&#x27;s severity.

===Personal life===
Harlay de Champvallon died suddenly, without having received the sacraments, on 6 August 1695. His funeral discourse was delivered by Père Gaillard, and Mme de Sévigné made on the occasion the severe comment that there were only two trifles to make this a difficult matter — his life and his death.

<text>Goodmanham (historically Godmundingaham, the home of the people of Godmund) is a small village and civil parish in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. It is situated approximately to the north-east of Market Weighton. The village is situated on the Yorkshire Wolds Way National Trail, a long-distance footpath.
According to the 2011 UK Census, Goodmanham parish had a population of 244, an increase on the 2001 UK Census figure of 218.

The village is built in a favourable position on a south-facing slope of the Yorkshire Wolds between two streams. It has a copious supply of water from numerous springs and naturally occurring limestone for building. The land is extraordinarily fertile in this region and people have lived here since prehistoric times.

==History==
===Prehistory to Roman occupation===

The earliest traces of settlement are from the Stone Age. There are many ancient burial sites. The boundaries of the village lie along the lines of ancient earthworks and these are evidence that it was a prehistoric place of worship. Near the western boundary of the village lies one of the most ancient roads of Britain, later adopted by the Romans. Settlement at this time is indicated by finds of Samian ware and coins of the period.

===Middle Ages===
In the Anglo-Saxon period, after the recall of the Roman legions, the village reached a position of great importance and fame.

According to Bede in the &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, Goodmanham was the site of a heathen temple. His account begins with Eadwine of Deira calling a meeting of his wise men regarding whether or not to adopt Christianity in 627 CE. He describes how the (&quot;high priest&quot;) Coifi gave speech about the uselessness of worshipping the traditional gods and supported adopting Christianity. After breaking taboos such as mounting a stallion and bearing arms, both of which were provided by the king, he rides to the temple at Goodmanham and orders it to be torn down and burnt by his companions. Some aspects of this narrative are historically accurate such as the name of Goodmanham and likely the name Coifi. The general description of the temple is also consistent with evidence of religious buildings from English and other closely related cultural groups such as the temple at Uppsala. Despite this, the overall narrative and Coifi&#x27;s role in is generally regarded as ahistorical by scholars, being drawn principally from other Christian texts. It is believed that narrative is broadly an invention with Bede having been focused on biblical exegesis and reflecting on the concept of Redemption rather than accurately recording what happened.

Although Goodmanham is very near to York, the capital of Viking England, we have no information about Goodmanham from that period. It is next found as a listing in the Domesday Book of 1086, produced under William the Conqueror at the time of the Norman Conquest. A few names of resident farmers are given: Colgri, Orm, Norman, William de Coleville. These names show the presence of Normans now occupying the land.

The church of All Hallows now stands on or near the site of the original pagan temple. This church dates from around 1130 AD and replaces an earlier one of wooden construction built in the Saxon period. The church was designated a Grade I listed building in 1986 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England.
===Other notable features===
A tumulus, located to the south-west of the village, is also supposed to contain ruins. 

The village is home to two holy wells: a well dedicated to St Helena, and a spring that is known as the &quot;Lady Well&quot;, which was once used for baptisms.

In 1823 Baines&#x27; &quot;History, Directory and Gazetteer of the County of York&quot; gave an alternative Goodmanham name of &quot;Godmundin Graham&quot;. The village was a parish in the Wapentake of Harthill, and partly in the Liberty of St Peter. Population at the time was 220, with occupations including fifteen farmers, a boot &amp; shoe maker, a corn miller, a shoemaker, a wheelwright, a blacksmith who was also the parish clerk, and the licensed victualler of The Star public house. A carrier operated between the village and Market Weighton and Beverley once a week.

==Notable people==
* Richard Foster (20 August 1856 – 5 January 1932). He emigrated to South Australia in 1880. Held various posts including Commissioner for Public Works, Minister for Industry, Minister for Works and Railways.
* William Featherby (18 August 1888 – 20 November 1958), county cricketer for Yorkshire, lived and worked locally to Goodmanham all his life. He is buried in the churchyard.

<text>Ice Station is Australian thriller writer Matthew Reilly&#x27;s second novel, released in 1998.

&quot;Ice Station&quot; was presented as a live audio drama at the 2016 Adelaide Fringe Festival.

== Plot summary ==
After a diving team at Wilkes Ice Station is killed, the station sends out a distress signal. A team of United States Force Recon Marines led by Shane Schofield, code named Scarecrow, arrives at the station. At the station he finds several French scientists have arrived, and several more come after the Marines&#x27; arrival. The French reveal themselves as soldiers and a fight ensues in the station, claiming the lives of Scarecrow&#x27;s men Hollywood, Legs and Ratman, along with several scientists and most of the French soldiers, while Mother loses her leg, Samurai is badly injured, and two French scientists are captured.

Schofield decides to send a team down to find an object below the ice where the diving team was going. Later, Samurai is found strangled, leaving the only people he trusts to be one of the scientists, Sarah Hensleigh and another soldier named Montana as he was with them at the time of Samurai&#x27;s death. Hensleigh, Montana and two other Marines, Gant and Santa Cruz, are sent down to where the diving team vanished. While alone, Schofield is shot and killed. He later wakes up, found to have been accidentally resurrected by his attacker, and is in the care of scientist James Renshaw, the believed killer of one of the other scientists at Wilkes. Watching a video of Schofield&#x27;s death, they see the attacker and discover it to be one of Schofield&#x27;s men, Snake. The two capture Snake before he is able to kill the wounded Mother.

Meanwhile in the United States, Andrew Trent and Pete Cameron meet, Cameron being a news reporter and Trent being a former Marine using the alias of Andrew Wilcox to avoid being found by the U.S military who a few years back had tried to kill him. They hear the distress call from Schofield and Trent realizes that what happened to him was happening to Schofield.

The team learns of an impending attack by the British SAS and decide to flee the station. During the escape via stolen vehicles, Schofield and Renshaw&#x27;s is pushed off a cliff, Schofield&#x27;s close friend Book and the step-daughter of Sarah Hensleigh, Kirsty, are captured, while Rebound escapes with four of the scientists. Schofield manages to destroy a French submarine and he and Renshaw begin their journey back towards it. Meanwhile, the SAS Brigadier Trevor Barnaby kills the two remaining French scientists and feeds Book to a pod of killer whales. Schofield returns to the station and manages to kill all of the SAS and Snake, and save Kirsty. Schofield receives a message from Trent with a list of members of a secret service known as the Intelligence Convergence Group (ICG) which includes Snake and Montana.

Gant and her team find what appears to be an alien ship, but which turns out to be a spy plane. Montana kills Santa Cruz, but is killed by mutated elephant seals. Schofield and the two others arrive and Hensleigh reveals herself to be an ICG agent, but is soon killed by a wounded Gant. Remembering the station is about to be destroyed, Schofield, Gant, Renshaw, Kirsty and her pet fur seal named Wendy escape on the spy plane and land on the USS Wasp. They later destroy the spy plane using a guided missile fired earlier. It is revealed that Mother had escaped Wilkes before its destruction and was saved by US forces.

The survivors get to Hawaii where they are nearly killed by an ICG agent before being saved by Andrew Trent, Pete and Allison Cameron, and the captain of the USS &quot;Wasp&quot;. Renshaw assumes custody of Kirsty since he is her godfather, and Schofield doesn&#x27;t leave Gant&#x27;s side until she recovers.

<text>The Unicorns were a Canadian rock band formed in the year 2000 by Nicholas Thorburn (Nick Diamonds) of British Columbia and Alden Penner (Alden Ginger) of Quebec. J&#x27;aime Tambeur joined in December 2003. The band announced their split in late 2004, before reuniting for a short run of shows in 2014.

==History==
The Unicorns began in Canada in December 2000. The founding members Nicholas Thorburn and Alden Penner met in high school in 1998. Alden was new to his 10th-grade class and decided to wear a skirt to school, which intrigued a 12th-grade Nick and quickly sparked their friendship. The duo self-recorded a nine-track CD entitled &quot;Unicorns Are People Too&quot; which was released in March 2003 through their own label Caterpillars of the Community. The release was limited to 500 copies, but was later distributed widely through file-sharing networks and fansites. Around this time they also self-recorded a Mini CDr entitled &quot;Three Inches of Blood&quot; which was given to venue owners who arranged the band&#x27;s early shows. A split 7-inch with Arcade Fire was also announced, but never materialized.

In June and July 2003 the band recorded their debut studio LP &quot;Who Will Cut Our Hair When We&#x27;re Gone?&quot; with producer Mark Lawson in Montreal. The album featured several reworked versions of songs from &quot;Unicorns Are People Too&quot; and featured contributions from Richard Reed Parry (Arcade Fire) and drummer Jamie Thompson who joined the band as a touring member later that year. The album was released in November 2003 on Alien8 Recordings in North America and Rough Trade in Europe. The album received glowing reviews from &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, &quot;NME&quot;, online magazine Pitchfork Media and numerous other publications around the world.

The band toured continuously across North America, Europe and Australia following the release of &quot;Who Will Cut Our Hair When We&#x27;re Gone?&quot;, including shows with The Decemberists, The Fiery Furnaces, Hot Hot Heat, and Arcade Fire. A promotional video was also produced for the song &quot;Jellybones&quot;, which aired occasionally on MTV2&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot;. In 2004, footage from multiple live performances was used to produce a promotional video for the song &quot;I Was Born (A Unicorn)&quot;. In May 2004 an EP entitled &quot;The Unicorns: 2014&quot; was released by Seattle label Suicide Squeeze. The band became known for their chaotic live shows, described as &quot;unruly, sometimes transcendent, sometimes akin to tantrums&quot;.

==Split and subsequent projects==
The band&#x27;s hectic touring schedule became exhausting, leading to tensions between band members. Their final show of 2004 took place at the Engine Room in Houston, TX on December 20, where they played several unreleased songs including &quot;Haunted House&quot;, &quot;Livin&#x27; in the Country&quot; and &quot;Rough Gem&quot; (later recorded by Islands). On December 28, a short message appeared on the Unicorns&#x27; website reading &quot;THE UNICORNS ARE DEAD, (R.I.P.)&quot;, leading fans to speculate as to whether they had broken up. In January 2005 the website Drowned In Sound confirmed that the band had indeed split. Asked about the band&#x27;s demise in 2006, Thompson commented, &quot;we all hated it like 70 percent of the time. It was just not getting along with one another on the road, and then being on the road &quot;all the time&quot;. That pretty much killed it&quot;.

Immediately following the split, Thorburn and Thompson continued to collaborate as Th&#x27; Corn Gangg (a hip-hop project featuring Subtitle and Busdriver) and Islands (an indie rock project). On May 28, 2006, Thompson announced his departure from Islands. He returned to the band in June 2009, but left again a year later. In 2005 Thorburn co-wrote the satirical charity single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Hallowe&#x27;en?&quot;. His other post-Unicorns projects have included Reefer, Human Highway and Mister Heavenly. In July 2011 he released an album entitled &quot;I Am an Attic&quot; through Bandcamp, reverting to his Unicorns nickname &quot;Nick Diamonds&quot;.

In 2005 Penner released a 7-inch single entitled &quot;The Ghost of Creaky Crater&quot; on the Melbourne-based Art School Dropout label, recorded while the band was on tour in Australia. His post-Unicorns musical projects have included Clues and The Hidden Words, in which he reunited with Thompson. In February 2014 he released solo album entitled &quot;Exegesis&quot; though Bandcamp.

==Reunion==
In early 2014, ten years after their split, it was announced that the band would reunite to support Arcade Fire on a handful of arena shows in Inglewood, CA and Brooklyn, NY. On September 21, 2014, they returned to the Pop Montreal Festival to play a headline show at Metropolis, but have not announced any further live dates. &quot;Who Will Cut Our Hair When We&#x27;re Gone?&quot; was also reissued on CD and vinyl through the band&#x27;s own imprint, Caterpillar Records.

<text>François de la Chaise (; 25 August 1624 – 20 January 1709), also known as Père Lachaise (Father Lachaise), was a French Jesuit priest, the father confessor of King Louis XIV of France.

==Biography==
François de la Chaise was born at the Château of Aix in Aix-la-Fayette, Puy-de-Dôme, Auvergne, being the son of Georges d&#x27;Aix, seigneur de La Chaise, and of Renée de Rochefort.

On his mother&#x27;s side he was a grandnephew of Pierre Coton, the confessor of Henry IV. He became a novice of the Society of Jesus before completing his studies at Lyon, where, after taking final vows, he lectured on philosophy to students attracted by his fame from all parts of France.

Through the influence of Camille de Villeroy, Archbishop of Lyon, Père de la Chaise was in 1674 nominated confessor of Louis XIV, who entrusted him during the lifetime of Harlay de Champvallon, archbishop of Paris, with the administration of the ecclesiastical patronage of the crown. The confessor united his influence with that of Madame de Maintenon to induce the king to abandon his liaison with Madame de Montespan. More than once at Easter he is said to have had a convenient illness which dispensed him from granting absolution to Louis XIV.
With the fall of Madame de Montespan and the ascendancy of Madame de Maintenon his influence vastly increased. The marriage between Louis XIV and Madame de Maintenon was celebrated in his presence at Versailles, but there is no reason for supposing that the subsequent coolness between him and Madame de Maintenon arose from his insistence on secrecy in this matter. During the long strife over the temporalities of the Gallican Church between Louis XIV and Innocent XI, Père de la Chaise supported the royal prerogative, though he used his influence at Rome to conciliate the papal authorities. He was largely responsible for the revocation of the Edict of Nantes.

He exercised a moderating influence on Louis XIV&#x27;s zeal against the Jansenists, and Saint-Simon, who was opposed to him in most matters, does full justice to his humane and honorable character. Père de la Chaise had a lasting and unalterable affection for Archbishop Fénelon, which remained unchanged by the papal condemnation of the &quot;Maximes&quot;.

In spite of failing faculties he continued his duties as confessor to Louis XIV to the end of his long life.
==Legacy==
The name of Father de la Chaise became attached to the Jesuit house where he lived – at the time outside the boundaries of Paris – and to the plot of land near that house. In 1804, Napoleon established a cemetery there – the well-known Père Lachaise Cemetery (literally &quot;The Father la Chaise Cemetery&quot;). Thus, his name lives on in the Paris landscape.

The lexicographer Philibert-Joseph Le Roux had to flee to Brussels after he published &quot;Histoire du père La Chaize, jésuite et confesseur du roi Louis XIV où l&#x27;on verra les intrigues secrettes qu&#x27;il a eues à la cour de France et dans toutes les cours de l&#x27;Europe&quot;, a pamphlet against de la Chaise.

William Hurt portrayed Father de la Chaise in the fantasy-adventure film &quot;The King&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (2022).

<doc id="539267" wikidata="Q749935" url="?curid=539267" title="Aston Martin DB9">
<text>The Aston Martin DB9 is a two-door grand touring car. It was produced in Gaydon, Warwickshire, by the British carmaker Aston Martin between 2004 and 2016 as both a coupé and a convertible, the latter known as the &quot;Volante&quot;. 

Succeeding the DB7, which Aston Martin produced from 1994 until 2004, the DB9 was designed by Ian Callum and Henrik Fisker and debuted at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 2003, while the Volante debuted at the Detroit Auto Show in the subsequent year. The DB9, which is built upon Aston Martin&#x27;s vertical/horizontal platform, employs extensive use lightweight materials—including aluminium and composite materials—throughout the body. Aston Martin implemented several incremental updates to the DB9, termed &quot;facelifts&quot;. The first two updates—which occurred in 2008 and 2010—involved minor changes to elements such as the headlights, tail-lights, engine and interior. The most noteworthy update occurred in 2012 when Aston Martin gave the car a completely redesigned front fascia. The headlights were the most significant update, which gave the car a design reminiscent of the 2011–2012 Virage. 

The company&#x27;s racing division, Aston Martin Racing, adapted the DB9 for sports car racing in the form of the DBR9 and the DBRS9 for the FIA GT1 and the FIA GT3, respectively. They were extensively modified; the interior features were removed and the aluminium body panels were replaced by carbon fibre panels. The engine was modified in both cars to produce more horsepower and torque. Aston Martin released three special editions of the DB9: the DB9 LM, the DB9 Zagato Spyder Centennial and the DB9 GT. The car was well-received by critics, with one reviewer describing its interior as &quot;one of the best known to man&quot;, but faced criticism for its handling and limited cargo space.

== Name ==
The letters &quot;DB&quot; are the initials of David Brown, the owner of Aston Martin between 1947 and 1972. Although the DB9 succeeded the DB7, Aston Martin did not name the car DB8 due to fears that the name would suggest that it featured a V8 engine—the DB9 has a V12. Reports indicated that Aston Martin held the belief that naming the car &quot;DB8&quot; would suggest a progressive evolution, given that the DB9 marked the introduction of an entirely new vehicle.

== Background ==
In 1994, Aston Martin, which Ford Motor Company owned at the time, began producing the DB7, a grand tourer positioned as an &quot;entry-level&quot; vehicle. It was the only Aston Martin that incorporated a steel monocoque construction, which was designed by Jaguar—a company that Ford also owned at the time. Designed by Ian Callum, the DB7 was available as both a coupe and convertible, the latter known as the Volante. In 1999, Aston Martin began manufacturing the DB7 Vantage, which featured a V12 engine developed by Ford in the United States. It became so popular that it started diverting sales from the six-cylinder model, leading to the latter&#x27;s discontinuation later that year. The DB7 remained in production until 2004, when Aston Martin had produced about 7,000 examples. It was the best-selling Aston Martin of its time, though it was eventually surpassed by subsequent models.

In the late 1990s, Aston Martin developed a model strategy that aimed to introduce various new technologies. Ford made significant investments in enhancing engine and structural technologies to create an entirely new platform, helping to restore Aston Martin&#x27;s reputation as a desirable luxury automaker. The Vanquish, introduced in 2001 to replace the Virage, was the first car of this new era. Following the rejection of previous product proposals, the replacement for the DB7 was announced as the &quot;DB9&quot;. This platform, namely the &quot;vertical/horizontal&quot;, would underpin most mass-produced Aston Martins produced between 2003 and 2016.

== Development ==

In July 2000, Ford appointed Ulrich Bez as chief executive officer and chairman of Aston Martin. The entry-level DB7 was due to be replaced by a car with the project codename &quot;AM802&quot;, slated to be a 2+2 grand touring car. During this time, a third project was in development, codenamed &quot;AM305&quot;. It was to be a smaller, two-seater car intended to compete with the Porsche 911 and the Ferrari 360. This car became the Vantage in 2005.

Callum was appointed as lead designer for the AM802 project. With the abrupt death of the designer Geoff Lawson in 1999, Callum had to alternate between designing at Jaguar and Aston Martin. Between 2000 and 2001, Bez requested that he work on two cars, the DB9 and what would become the V8 Vantage in 2005. Much of this work occurred at the Jaguar design centre in Whitley. The appointment of Henrik Fisker as lead designer in 2001 allowed Callum to focus principally on Jaguar. When asked by the magazine &quot;Car and Driver&quot; how much he had contributed to the vehicle, Callum replied, &quot;I would say pretty much 100 percent, including the interior. Maybe not the colour and trim and wood finishes but certainly the surfaces of the car.&quot;

Numerous DB9 pre-production prototypes and concepts were tested over various locations globally, amassing over collectively. Aston Martin conducted testing at the Ford Lommel Proving Grounds in Belgium as well as high-speed testing at the Nardò Ring in Italy, the Nürburgring in Germany, the MIRA test track and the Millbrook Proving Ground, the latter two in the United Kingdom. Aston Martin subjected the vehicles to hot-weather trials in Death Valley, the world&#x27;s hottest location, and cold-weather evaluations within Sweden&#x27;s Arctic Circle. Further tests occurred in New Zealand, encompassing both summer and winter conditions. Aston Martin deliberately destroyed most of the cars but three were retained and appeared in the film &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (2006). Following their cinematic appearances, all three vehicles were rendered undriveable.

The car debuted in September 2003 at the Frankfurt Motor Show. The official series manufacture of the DB9 coupe began in January 2004 at the Gaydon facility in Warwickshire, England; the DB9 marked the first model built there. In a 2007 interview, Bez stated that, though Aston Martin was traditionally a maker of more exclusive automobiles, he believed that the company needed to be more visible and build more cars. At launch, Aston Martin planned to produce between 1,400 and 1,500 examples annually.

== Design and technology ==
As opposed to its predecessor with a steel monocoque construction, the DB9, which uses the &quot;vertical/horizontal&quot; platform, employs aluminium extensively throughout its construction. The body structure comprises aluminium and composite materials melded together by mechanically fixed self-piercing rivets and robotic-assisted adhesive bonding techniques. The bonded aluminium structure possesses more than double the torsional rigidity of its predecessor despite being 25 percent lighter. The DB9 also has anti-roll bars and double wishbone suspension supported by coil springs. The rear suspension incorporates additional anti-squat and anti-lift technology to control heavy acceleration or braking. While DB9&#x27;s exterior skin mostly consists of aluminium, the front bumpers and bonnet are made of composite materials. The DB9&#x27;s platform is also used by the Rapide, DBS, Vantage, Virage, 2012 Vanquish and Lagonda Taraf.

From the outset, Aston Martin intended for the front passenger cabin of the DB9 to incorporate a spacious, comfortable two-seater design; the rear passenger cabin—which also has two seats—was to be used more commonly as stowage space. The car&#x27;s interior design was inspired by the 2001 Vanquish&#x27;s but many alterations were made to differentiate the cars; for example, the air vents were mounted lower, leaving space for the pop-up satellite navigation positioned above. Instead of the Vanquish&#x27;s red starter button, which was often described as &quot;vulgar&quot;, Aston Martin opted for a clear glass button engraved with the brand&#x27;s name, which illuminated blue when the ignition was on and red during engine operation. The DB9&#x27;s interior is upholstered in leather and has a walnut wood trim. Satellite navigation and Bluetooth were initially optional but became standard in later models. Later models also offered a Dolby Prologic sound system connectable to satellite radio, a six-CD changer, an iPod connector, a USB connector, or an auxiliary input jack. A seating package, which removes the back seats and replaces the front seats with lighter seats made of Kevlar and carbon fibre, was available, deducting . The boot capacity is in the coupe or in the Volante.

The DB9 uses a 5.9-litre V12 engine. It generates of torque at 5,000 rpm and a maximum power output of at 6,000 rpm. The DB9 can accelerate from 0 to in 4.7 seconds and has a top speed of . Its rear-wheel drive layout and front mid-engine design improves weight distribution. The DB9 could be equipped with either a six-speed conventional manual gearbox manufactured by Graziano Trasmissioni or a six-speed ZF Friedrichshafen &#x27;Touchtronic&#x27; automatic gearbox featuring paddle-operated semi-automatic mode. The automatic gearbox increases the 0 to acceleration time to 4.9 seconds, though the top speed remains the same. The gearbox is rear-mounted and is driven by a carbon-fibre tail shaft inside a cast aluminium torque tube. The DB9 launched with wheels, with the front ones measuring in width and the rear ones at . Featuring Bridgestone Potenza 235/40ZR19 tyres in the front and 275/35ZR19 in the rear, the car&#x27;s braking system relies on Brembo four-piston callipers.

== Updates ==
In 2008, the DB9 received a facelift. The car was largely unchanged; the updates included stylistic tweaks such as door mirrors resembling those of the DBS model, revised wheels and a grille with new elements integrated into its traditional design. The DB9&#x27;s 5.9-litre V12 received an increase of and , achieved by increased compression and a deeper sump, reducing friction as the crankshaft moves through its oil bath. The car&#x27;s maximum speed was raised to and its 0 to acceleration was increased to 4.6 seconds. The car also received a revised &quot;Touchtronic 2&quot; gearbox with an electronic shift-by-wire control system. Upgrades were made to both the standard and sports pack suspension systems, replacing Dynamics dampers with Bilstein dampers. The change resulted in improved handling, addressing the previously harsh ride quality at low speeds.

In June 2010, Aston Martin implemented another facelift for the DB9. Adjusted by Marek Reichman, the updates involved a refreshed front bumper, clear tail-lights and more defined wings. A smoother body contour decorates the door sills, extending from the updated front fascia to the rear wings. Aston Martin updated the DB9&#x27;s Bluetooth system, implemented a tyre-pressure monitoring system and included a new &quot;Double Apex&quot; aluminium trim finish. Buyers could upgrade to a Bang &amp; Olufsen stereo sound system. About revising the styling of the DB9, Reichman quoted that &quot;the beauty of an Aston Martin comes from harmonious proportions, a ground-hugging stance, taut surfacing and a complete and thorough attention to detail[...] The DB9 epitomises these qualities; it is beautiful but subtle—not attention seeking.&quot;

In October 2012, Aston Martin unveiled the DB9&#x27;s most substantial facelift, which replaced the second generation of the Virage. Designed by Reichman, the facelifted DB9&#x27;s most prominent changes lie in its exterior. Aston Martin made significant changes to the bodywork by adapting design cues from the Virage such as enlarging the recessed headlight clusters with bi-xenon lights and LED daytime running strips, implementing a new five-bar grille and integrating a new rear spoiler with the boot lid. The upgraded V12 increased its power output to and torque to . The car&#x27;s 0 to acceleration time decreased to 4.5 seconds, and the top speed stood at . Aston Martin also introduced three driving modes: normal, suitable for daily driving; sport, offering enhanced precision at the expense of comfort; and track, intensifying the characteristics of the sport mode. The car&#x27;s final update, the DB9 GT, increased its power output to .

==Variants==
===DB9 Volante===
At the Detroit Auto Show in January 2004, Aston Martin unveiled the DB9 Volante convertible; manufacture began in February 2005. In case of a rollover incident, the Volante features reinforced windshield pillars and two deployable hoops behind the rear seats. These hoops remain active at all times and, if triggered, will shatter the car&#x27;s rear window. Aston Martin has adjusted the Volante&#x27;s suspension system for smoother cruising by softening the springs and reducing the weight of the anti-roll bars, resulting in a more gentle suspension. The convertible top of the Volante is made of folding fabric and opens in seventeen seconds. The Volante weighs , slightly heavier than its coupe counterpart.

The coupe and Volante variants share the semi-automatic and automatic gearboxes along with the engine. Initially, the car&#x27;s speed was limited to to retain the roof&#x27;s integrity but Aston Martin removed this limitation starting with the upgraded 2007 model. Like the coupe, the original Volante has of torque at 5,000 rpm and a maximum power of at 6,000 rpm. The 0 to takes 4.9 seconds due to the additional weight. In 2008, the Volante&#x27;s output increased to and , and in 2012, outputs increased to and , and its kerb weight reduced to .

===DB9 LM===
To commemorate Aston Martin&#x27;s triumph in the GT1 category at the 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans, Aston Martin launched the DB9 LM (Le Mans) in early 2008. This special edition includes the DB9&#x27;s optional sports pack as standard and is exclusively available in coupe body style with automatic transmission. It was only available in the &quot;Sarthe Silver&quot; exterior colour, named after the Circuit de la Sarthe, where the Le Mans takes place. It features red brake callipers, a chrome mesh grille, and a bespoke black leather interior with red stitching, featuring the Le Mans track intricately stitched onto the central console. The car has clear glass rear lights borrowed from the DBS. Aston Martin initially intended for a production run of 124 units, each allocated to a different dealer. However, some dealers opted out of their allocations, leading to 69 cars being produced.

=== DB9 Zagato Spyder Centennial ===
For Aston Martin&#x27;s 100-year anniversary, Zagato unveiled a one-off car based on the DB9 Volante called the &quot;Zagato Spyder Centennial&quot;. Commissioned by the collector Peter Read, the car was painted green and revealed alongside the Aston Martin DBS Coupe Zagato Centennial. The car, with on the odometer, sold for $693,000 (including the buyer&#x27;s fee) at RM Sotheby&#x27;s Monterey auction during car week in 2015.

===DB9 GT===
In 2015, Aston Martin unveiled the final iteration of the DB9, named the DB9 GT. The engine possesses a power output of at 6,750 rpm and of torque at 5,500 rpm. It accelerates from 0 to in 4.4 seconds, from 0 to in 10.2 seconds, and can run the quarter-mile in 12.8 seconds. Its top speed remains unchanged at .

== Discontinuation ==
In 2015, Aston Martin announced that the DB9&#x27;s successor would be named the &quot;DB11&quot;. The upcoming model range, which the DB11 was a part of, was to introduce a refreshed design approach directed by Reichman. Insider reports indicated that this model range aimed to address critiques of the existing lineup by emphasising distinctive differences among the models, aligning them more closely with the well-known Italian automaker Ferrari. On 22 July 2016, Aston Martin posted a picture on Twitter of the final nine DB9s—dubbed the &quot;Last of 9&quot;—produced, all of which were painted dark grey. On 27 July 2016, these last nine units had their final inspection before rolling off the production line later that day, marking the end of a twelve-year manufacture during which about 16,500 units were manufactured.

== Motorsport ==
=== DBR9 ===

The DB9 has been adapted for use in sports car racing by Aston Martin Racing (AMR), a collaboration between Aston Martin and Prodrive. The DBR9, developed to follow FIA GT1 regulations, debuted in 2005. AMR replaced most of the car&#x27;s aluminium body panels with carbon fibre panels, and several external features, like a front splitter and a rear wing, have been added to increase the car&#x27;s downforce. AMR upgraded the brakes to lightweight Brembo discs and six-piston callipers. The transmission in the DBR9 is an Xtrac six-speed sequential manual mounted at the rear axle. The engine modifications allow it to have a power output of . The increase in engine power and weight reduction allowed the DBR9 to accelerate from 0 to in 3.4 seconds and 0 to in 6.4 seconds. The DBR9 won in its debut at the 2005 12 Hours of Sebring and has since secured victories in various other events, including the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

===DBRS9===

AMR developed a variant of the DBR9 to follow FIA GT3 regulations. The DBRS9 shares its carbon-fibre bodywork, chassis and suspension layout with the DBR9. While the engine is shared with the DBR9, it has been detuned and has a power output of and of torque. The DBRS9 featured a six-speed gearbox or a six-speed sequential gearbox and has a 0 to acceleration time of 3.4 seconds and a top speed of . The DBRS9 competed in several endurance races and additionally raced in the FIA GT3 European Championship for which it was designed before being replaced by a GT3 version of the V12 Vantage in 2011.

==Reception==
Car critics have generally lauded the DB9 coupe and Volante, commending their opulent interior and exterior designs. The automotive show &quot;Top Gear&quot; held the DB9 in high regard, even giving it a special mention in its &quot;Cool Wall&quot; segment. The presenters called the DB9 &quot;too cool&quot; for the wall, however, and it earned its own category dubbed &quot;the DB9 Fridge&quot;, likened to a mini-refrigerator containing the car&#x27;s card. While reviewing the Volante, Richard Hammond called the interior of the DB9 &quot;one of the best known to man&quot;, although he found the car to be less rigid than the coupe, leading to a somewhat &quot;wobbly&quot; experience.

The car reviewers Edmunds and the magazine &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; criticised the DB9 for having poorer handling than its competitors, noting that the car is not firm enough. Nonetheless, Edmunds acknowledged that while the Mercedes-Benz SL600 and SL55 AMG were objectively better cars, the DB9 was more desirable. In direct comparisons with faster cars like the Porsche 911 Turbo S Cabriolet and the Ford GT, the DB9 was ranked poorly; the &quot;Car and Driver&quot; reviewer noted that comparing it against faster cars &quot;highlighted its shortcomings&quot;. Similarly, compared to the Bentley Continental GT, Mercedes-Benz CL600, and the Ferrari 612 Scaglietti F1, the DB9 ranked poorly again, though reviewers said that &quot;despite its problems, the DB9 would be [their] personal choice&quot;. The stiffness issues were largely rectified in later iterations of the DB9, as observed by the magazine &quot;Autoweek&quot;.

The DB9&#x27;s interior has been called &quot;dazzling&quot;, with Edmunds saying, &quot;[w]ords like &#x27;rich&#x27; and &#x27;crafted&#x27; just don&#x27;t cut it, though &#x27;decadent&#x27; and &#x27;sculpted by the Almighty himself&#x27; get close&quot;. Reviewers complained about the back seats, with the magazine &quot;Forbes&quot; stating that they &quot;[thought] of it more as a padded parcel shelf&quot;. Likewise, reviewers complained that the space for cargo was limited, though many quipped the small back seats could help hold luggage. Another common complaint was the car&#x27;s poor satellite navigation system, which the magazine &quot;Automobile&quot; described as the &quot;Achilles&#x27; heel&quot;, noting that &quot;selecting a route is painful at best&quot;. Newer models contain a revised satellite navigation system sourced from Garmin.

<text>Ratu [[Sir]] Josefa Lalabalavu Vanayaliyali Sukuna (22 April 1888 – 30 May 1958) was a Fijian chief, scholar, soldier, and statesman. He is regarded as the forerunner of the post-independence leadership of Fiji. He did more than anybody to lay the groundwork for self-government by fostering the development of modern institutions in Fiji, and although he died a dozen years before independence from the United Kingdom was achieved in 1970, his vision set the course that Fiji was to follow in the years to come.

== Lineage ==

Sukuna was born into a chiefly family on Bau, off the island of Viti Levu, the largest island in the Fiji archipelago. His father, Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi, was the son of the Bauan noble and rebel leader Ratu Mara Kapaiwai.

After joining the Audit Office as a clerk at an early age, Ratu Madraiwiwi had steadily worked his way up through the civil service, establishing connections along the way that were later to prove decisive in the life of his son. Ratu Sukuna&#x27;s mother, Adi Litiana Maopa, was the sister of the Tui Nayau, Ratu Alifereti Finau Ulukalala (High Chief of Lau) and father of Ratu Tevita Uluilakeba III [the father of Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara]

Ratu Mara Kapaiwai of Bau was born in 1815, son of Ratu Vuibureta and Adi Mere Veisaca. Ratu Vuibureta was the sixth son of Ratu Banuve Baleivavalagi the 3rd Vunivalu of Bau from 1770 to 1803 and Adi Ufia from Lakeba.

Throughout his life, Ratu Sukuna was regarded as a credible contender for the title of Tui Viti.

Although he was not accorded a chiefly title from Bau his birthplace, he was installed as the second Tui Lau in 1938 following the traditional process of consultation between the Yavusa Vuanirewa and the endorsement of the Tui Nayau, Ratu Tevita Uluilakeba III following the passing of Ratu Alifereti Finau Ulukalala as referenced in the TRY Lakeba. He held the title of Tui Lau until his death in 1958.

==Early life==

Sukuna&#x27;s exposure to diverse cultures came early. Although Sukuna was an indigenous Fijian, his father enrolled him at the Wairuku Indian School in Ra, founded in 1898 by Pandit Badri Maharaj, who later served from 1917 to 1929 as the first Indo-Fijian member of Fiji&#x27;s Legislative Council (the forerunner to the present Parliament. One of the teachers at the school was the Rev. Charles Andrew. Andrew was a colourful character, an Oxford-educated Anglican clergyman who had converted to Roman Catholicism and then back again, before sailing for the mission field in Fiji. Determined that Sukuna should receive the best education possible, his father arranged for him to receive private tuition from Andrew. He was a strict teacher, beating Sukuna on occasion.

Sukuna proved to be an exceptionally able student; author Deryck Scarr later said of him that he spoke English with &quot;the bell-like tones of standard southern English, as though he had studied diction with the royal family&quot; – a compliment rarely paid even to a native speaker, let alone one who knew English only as a second language. Largely as a result of Andrew&#x27;s influence, the young Ratu Sukuna was sent to the prestigious Wanganui Collegiate School in Wanganui, New Zealand. He proved to be a bright pupil. He was a strong debater, played rugby and cricket, and became the Wanganui Collegiate boxing champion.

== War hero and Scholar ==

It was at this point in his life that the connections cultivated by Sukuna&#x27;s father throughout his career proved decisive. No Fijians to date had graduated from a university, and the British colonial administration was unwilling to encourage higher learning for the natives. However, Ratu Madraiwiwi was personally acquainted with the colonial Governor, Sir Francis Henry May, and in 1911 asked him to try to arrange for his son to study at a British university on the grounds that he had passed the matriculation exams at Wanganui Collegiate School. May&#x27;s influence persuaded the British Colonial Secretary, reluctantly, to grant Sukuna a one-year leave of absence from his responsibilities in Fiji to study history at Wadham College, Oxford, in 1913. Financial constraints had prevented him from realising his dream of pursuing a four-year law degree at Cambridge.

Ratu Sukuna had little time to settle down to his studies. World War I broke out and Sukuna applied for enlistment in the British Army. The British government, however, had a policy of refusing enlistment to Fijians, a policy rationalised by a wish to avoid exploiting the native people. Believing that Fijians would never gain the respect of their British rulers, without proving their worth on the battlefield, Sukuna enlisted in the French Foreign Legion instead. He fought bravely and was wounded towards the end of 1915 and forced to return to Fiji. He returned to France the following year, however, with the Native Transport Detachment, a newly formed contingent assisting the British Army. Apparently, the British colonial authorities had had a change of heart about native participation in the war. For his wartime service, Ratu Sukuna was awarded the Croix de Guerre.

Now a war hero, Ratu Sukuna had no difficulty raising funds for his return to Oxford. Towards the end of 1918, he graduated from the history course that was shortened for returned servicemen. He proceeded to the Middle Temple in London, and by 1921 had graduated with both a BA and an LL.B degree. He thus became the first-ever Fijian to receive a university degree.

== The Statesman ==

Meanwhile, Sukuna&#x27;s father had died in 1920, and he had to return to Fiji to take his place as head of the mataqali, or clan. He brought with him a tailored isulu, a skirt worn by men, which became Fiji&#x27;s national dress. He became a chief assistant in the Native Lands Commission in 1922, and a decade later he was stationed in Lomaloma, and also on the island of Lakeba in the Lau Islands, as a district and provincial commissioner. The same year, he was appointed to the Legislative Council to represent the Fijian people. (At that time, non-European members were appointed, rather than elected). In this capacity, Sukuna attended the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in London in 1937.

In 1938, Sukuna was installed as the &quot;Tui Lau (Protector of the Tongans of Sawana in Vanuabalavu),&quot; a senior chiefly title in the Lau Islands that had been vacant for many years. In many respects, this formalised what had long been the reality that he was the most influential chief in Fiji, notwithstanding the seniority enjoyed by other chiefs. Sukuna&#x27;s education complemented his lineage: he was a descendant of Fijian and Lauan royalty, and no other chief held a university degree. It was by hard work, however, that he earned the respect of his people. Travelling from village to village, Sukuna listened to the common people and took their concerns back to the colonial authorities. In 1940, he returned to Suva as the Native Lands Reserves Commissioner. That year he was awarded the CBE. In 1942 he set about recruiting Fijian men for the World War II effort. The British government had completely reversed its former position of not permitting natives to enlist, and the Fijian Battalion, commanded by Ratu Edward Cakobau (a relative of Sukuna&#x27;s) fought with distinction. At long last, Fijians had begun to earn the respect of the British authorities, and after the war, they began steps towards fostering self-government in Fiji.

One of Ratu Sukuna&#x27;s greatest achievements was his role in the establishment of the Native Land Trust Board. Most of the land of Fiji was owned by the &quot;mataqali,&quot; or clans, but worked by Indo-Fijian farmers. Prior to 1940, each clan individually negotiated the terms of leasing the land to those who farmed it, resulting in a wide variation of lease terms. As most landholdings were small, few &quot;mataqali&quot; were able to develop their plots to any large degree. The then colonial governor, Sir Arthur Gordon, proposed establishing a central body to hold the land in trust and lease it to willing farmers on terms that would be uniform throughout Fiji. The pressing need of the time was to provide land for a growing population of Indo-Fijian farmers, without expropriating it from its Fijian owners, and to do so in a way that was consistent. As early as 1933, Ratu Sukuna had recognised this problem, and had told the Great Council of Chiefs, &quot;We regard the Indian desire for more permanent tenancy as a natural and legitimate consequence an agricultural community settling in any country. But how was this desire to be reconciled with the need to protect the interests of present and future Fijian landowners?&quot; The Native Land Trust Board scheme emerged as a solution.

Persuading the various &quot;mataqali&quot; to accept the scheme, however, was far from easy. The landowners were being asked to surrender, forever, the control of their land, and entrust its administration to a central authority that would act in the national interest, as well as that of the owners. Almost single-handedly, Ratu Sukuna set about explaining the proposal to every &quot;mataqali&quot; in Fiji. Rather than rely on radio broadcasts or printed flyers, he determined to take the proposal in person to every village in the country. After explaining it to the people, he would leave to allow the idea to percolate and would return later to answer more questions. If necessary, he would return again and again, gradually building a consensus in favour of the plan. Finally, after a long and vigorous debate, the Great Council of Chiefs approved the scheme in what Sir Philip Mitchell, the then Governor, described as &quot;one of the greatest acts of faith and trust in colonial history.&quot; Ratu Sukuna himself was assigned the task of examining each landholding and deciding what portion should be reserved for the present and future needs of the &quot;mataqali,&quot; and what portion should be made available for leasing.

Meanwhile, Sukuna had become Secretary for Fijian Affairs. In 1944, he reestablished the Native Regulations Board, later renamed the Fijian Affairs Board. Then in 1950, he was appointed as an advisor to the British delegation to the Fourth Committee at Lake Success. He said that while self-government was indeed the goal in the South Pacific, it would have to be of a kind that the local people could understand and work with.

Sukuna was created a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1939, and awarded a knighthood in 1946, in recognition of his services to Fiji. After receiving a second knighthood KCMG in 1953, Ratu Sukuna was appointed the first native-born Speaker (politics) of the Legislative Council in 1954. Although it was only partially elected and had few of the powers of the modern Parliament of Fiji, the Legislative Council provided a venue for Fiji&#x27;s future leaders to gain experience in the workings of government. In 1956, Ratu Sukuna encouraged the formation of Fiji&#x27;s first political party, the Fijian Association under the leadership of Ratu Edward Cakobau.

== Ratu Sukuna&#x27;s Legacy ==

Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna was married twice, first to Adi Maraia Vosawale (1903–1956) in 1928, and later to Maca Likutabua (1934–2000) in September 1957, eight months before his death. Neither marriage produced any children, and his successor as the Tui Lau was his nephew, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara. The late Adi Alani Sovanatabua (later Dimuri, when she married Ratu Kinivilame Pai Dimuri, of Naseakula, Macuata) was the only child and daughter of Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna as a result of a de facto relationship with Roko Melaia Lutukivuya, daughter of Roko Jone Liwaki, the brother of Ratu Alifereti Finau Ulukalala. Ratu Sukuna had acknowledged Adi Sovanatabua as his daughter. Roko Melaia Lutukivuya was the first cousin of Ratu Tevita Uluilakeba III and aunt of Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara.

Ratu Sukuna died en route to England on the ship , on 30 May 1958. He was buried at the Vatanitawake, the Sau Tabu in Tubou, Lakeba alongside great leaders of Lau.

Although he did not live to see Fiji gain its independence (in 1970), the role he played in the pre-independence years was crucial; without him, there might not have been a Fijian state or its creation would almost certainly have been delayed. Not only was his personal role decisive, he also mentored several of the men who were to play pivotal roles in the post-independence years. His nephew, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, became a world figure as Fiji&#x27;s first Prime Minister and later served as President; Ratu Sir Edward Cakobau served for many years as a Cabinet minister and his cousin, Ratu Sir George Cakobau became the country&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; Head of State as its first native-born Governor-General; and Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau became the last Governor-General of the Dominion of Fiji and the first President of the Republic of Fiji. All four had been personally selected by Ratu Sukuna for leadership, mentored by him, and educated abroad at his expense. Upon his passing Ratu Sukuna had nothing more to his name but 50 cents which was concluded that in a sense, he gave everything he had to his nation and investing in the education of his successors. Long after his death, they continued to regard him as their mentor and saw the implementation of his vision as their sacred responsibility. Even today, now that the torch has been passed to a younger generation, most Fijian politicians, even from the Indo-Fijian community, regard themselves as heirs of his legacy.

Fiji&#x27;s third constitutional President, Ratu Josefa Iloilo, described Ratu Sukuna as &quot;a great and noble man ... whose foresight and vision still impacts on our future.&quot;

<text>Coifi is a priest recorded by Bede in the &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; as having presided over the temple at Goodmanham in the Northumbria in 627. He occurs in a story relating to the conversion of the Northumbrian elites in the court of Eadwine of Deira, in which he renounces Anglo-Saxon paganism in favour of Christianity, before leading a group to destroy and burn down the temple over which he had presided.

The historical reliablility of the account has been dated by scholars, who have noted that while some imagery does show similarities with motifs from Germanic religion and mythology, Bede&#x27;s description likely draws heavily from existing Christian tradition and likely does not accurately represent how the events transpired.

== Overview of Bede&#x27;s account ==
In the &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; Bede describes the circumstances around the conversion of King Eadwine of Deira. Before agreeing to be baptised, Bede records that the king discussed the matter with his leading men, including the (&quot;chief priest&quot;) Coifi. Coifi explains in a speech that he believes that worshipping the gods of the traditional religion is pointless, basing this on the fact that while he worships them more than anyone, others receive more gifts and honours than him. He explains that if the gods had power, they would help him and he urges the group present to convert as soon as possible.

Following this first speech, another man present supports Coifi, using the metaphor that life is like a sparrow flying through a warm hall in winter, having a brief respite before travelling out again into the storm outside again. He argues that Christianity provides more certainty of before and after one&#x27;s life and should thus be followed. The Christian god then spurs the others there to speak in agreement.

Coifi then speaks again asking to learn more of Christianity from Paulinus, which leads him expressing his lack of belief in the heathen gods. admitting that he has felt this way for a long time. The priest then advises the king that they ban and burn down the temples and altars that he had hallowed without receiving any benefit. Bede writes that he then broke the religious taboos of his priesthood by arming himself and getting up on a male horse that Eadwine provided him before riding to the temple at Goodmanham. Both the weapons and the horse were provided by the king. The crowd who saw him riding there thought he was mad and as soon as he gets there, God inspires him to desecrate the temple. He does by casting a spear at it, and has it torn down and set fire to by his companions while Coifi rejoices in the knowledge that he is now worshipping the true god. In Alcuin&#x27;s retelling of the story, he writes that Eadwine ordered Coifi to profane the shrine.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Coifi&quot; is very rare in Anglo-Saxon sources, occurring only in the &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; in the narrative about the Northumbrian priest and in accounts derived from it such as Alcuin&#x27;s retelling, in which the form &quot;Coefi&quot; is used, and the Old English version of the &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, in which the form &quot;Cefi&quot; is used. Furthermore, the name &quot;Ceefi&quot; is recorded in a list of monks in the early 9th century core of the Durham &quot;Liber Vitae&quot; which is probably related to Coifi, however the origins of all of these names are unclear.

It has been suggested that Bede could have either exploited an existing tradition, or actively chosen the name, so as to draw links with the name Caiaphas, referred to in the Vulgate version of the Gospel of John as a , the same term Bede uses for Coifi.

==Historicity and interpretation==
The historicity of Bede&#x27;s account has been questioned by scholars with it being noted that the account closely resembles other Christian works such as the &quot;Prose Life of Cuthbert&quot;, with it being argued that the account is not an accurate depiction of the events surrounding the Christianisation of Northumbria, but instead a work of literary inversion and biblical exegesis reflecting on the Redemption.

One description that it closely parallels is that of Clovis I&#x27;s baptism in the writings of Gregory of Tours. Whilst this account has no high priest, Clovis&#x27; wife Clothildis is given very similar words to speak by Gregory as Coifi is given by Bede; she insists to the king that he is to stop worshopping worthless gods made of materials such as stone and wood. Clovis realises the pointlessness of his former practices and promises to convert when he is losing a battle against the Alamans if God gives him victory. After winning, he speaks with his people who spontaneously reject their gods that Gregory labels as mortal and agreed to be baptised by St Remigius who urged them to burn what they had formerly worshipped as he baptised them.

It has been suggested that whilst Coifi&#x27;s speech sounds like Bede&#x27;s own words put into the priest&#x27;s mouth, he could have heard the tale directly from someone who witnessed it. The probability of this has been doubted, however, with it being suggested that it is more likely that Bede was using a well-known topos that may have been borrowed from Gregory of Tours. It has been suggested that Bede was trying to put forward a likely turn of events given that Eadwine did convert and assuming that a high priest was present.

Based on comparisons with Old Nordic religion, the existence of a heathen priesthood has been doubted, leading to further questioning of the accuracy of the account. Coifi&#x27;s role in the narrative closely resembles that of priests in Northumbria after the adoption of Christianity and while taboos against the carrying of weapons and the riding of stallions are attested in Germanic contexts in certain situations, the two taboos also were applied to Christian priests. It has thus been argued that the role of Coifi in the tale is very unlikely to reflect the reality of the situation or the wider institutional structure of Anglo-Saxon paganism.

The account further closely resembles Biblical traditions, with the speech made by one of Eadwine&#x27;s companions about the sparrow flying through the hall echoing Psalm 84, which was one of Bede&#x27;s favourite Psalms. The usage of the word (&quot;spear&quot;) for the weapon Coifi throws at the shrine, instead of the more common word , may have been in reference to the Vulgate version of the Gospel of John, in which the word is used for the spear that pierces Christ&#x27;s side. Bede may thus have depicted Coifi piercing the heathen shrine as an inversion of the piercing of the temple that is Christ&#x27;s body, leading to an outflowing of the blood of the eucharist and the water of baptism. Coifi&#x27;s actions could have been presented to symbolise opening the Northumbrians up to the possibility of conversion to Christianity and salvation.

Some elements of the account are likely historically accurate, however, such as the names of Goodmanham and Coifi. The description of the temple at Goodmanham as consisting of temples and altars surrounded by fences or hedges has also been considered as possible evidence regarding heathen religious enclosures. The temple has also been examined in light of excavations of possible religious structures such as that at Yeavering and in Scandinavia, and written accounts such as that of the temple at Uppsala, with common shared features being identified including them being made of wood, containing altars and being nearby enclosures.

A further theory put forward by Richard North is that Paulinus disguised as Woden acted under the alias of Coifi and profaned the shrine in a desperate effort to stop Eadwine celebrating fertility rites during Lent that would have led him to break his fast.

==Sources==
Bede&#x27;s account on Eadwine&#x27;s conversion has been proposed to have been principally based on two sources: a tradition from Whitby where Eadwine was buried that is found in the &quot;Earliest Life of Gregory the Great&quot;, and a tradition based in Canterbury that possibly originated from Paulinus who fled there after the death of Eadwine at the hands of Cadwallon ap Cadfan and Penda in 633.

<doc id="539289" wikidata="Q5123100" url="?curid=539289" title="City Circle tram">
<text>The City Circle (Melbourne tram route 35) is a zero-fare tram running around the Melbourne central business district in Australia. Running along the city centre&#x27;s outermost thoroughfares the route passes many Melbourne attractions including Parliament House, the Old Treasury Building and the developing Docklands waterfront precinct. Since October 2023, it operates in a clockwise direction only.

==History==

The tram route was introduced on 29 April 1994, requiring a small track extension along Spring Street, between Collins and Flinders Streets, to enable a complete CBD loop to be formed. The Federal Government&#x27;s Building Better Cities program funded the $6.4 million capital cost of the track expansion, while the State Government funded the running costs.

Until January 2003, the western leg of the original route of the tram was down Spencer Street, but the route was then extended west to run through Harbour Esplanade, Docklands. The travel time around the circle before this change was 40 minutes.

Between May and November 2005, the route temporarily ran between Flinders Street / Spencer Street and Victoria Parade / Nicholson Street due to the closure and removal of the Flinders Street Overpass over King Street.

During early 2006, new Passenger Information Displays were installed along with Digital Voice Announcements.

In April 2008, the service adopted the daylight saving timetable on a permanent basis, operating from 10:00 to 21:00 every Thursday, Friday and Saturday. The end of service at other times is 18:00.

On 30 May 2009, the route was altered for a second time, being extended from Harbour Esplanade to the NewQuay and Waterfront City precincts via Docklands Drive. This made the route an elongated &#x27;q&#x27;.

Services after 18:00 between Thursday and Sunday were removed in November 2020.

Due to driver shortages, the route&#x27;s operator, Yarra Trams, has found it hard to run all City Circle tram services. Due to this, since 30 October 2023, the route only runs in a clockwise direction between 9:30 and 17:30 daily.

==Route==

The route of the City Circle trams roughly follows the outer edges of the Hoddle Grid, with three diversions. It takes in all of La Trobe Street, Harbour Esplanade and Flinders Street. It follows Spring Street between Flinders and Bourke Streets, but travels along Nicholson Street and Victoria Street before turning into La Trobe Street. At the junction of Harbour Esplanade and Latrobe Street trams turn off the loop to run to and from a terminus towards the end of Docklands Drive, Waterfront City.

==Operation==
The City Circle route is operated with heritage W class trams, restored to original condition as part of the W8 upgrade. As of 2020, these are the only W-class trams on the system, and there are no plans to retire them. The City Circle trams originally sported a unique maroon livery promoting the service, however as part of the W8 upgrade the trams were restored back to their original green and cream livery. Until 2014, the City Circle was one of several routes to run W-class trams (30, 78 and 79) but the remaining routes controversially had their W-class trams removed, mostly replaced by A class. Trams display the route number 35. The City Circle operates at a headway of 12 minutes in the clockwise direction, with the service taking approximately 60 minutes to complete a loop. An average of three million passengers use the service every year, with each tram circling the city 9 times a day, or 12 times when the tram operates to 21:00.

<text>Holta is a small farming village in the municipality of Strand in Rogaland county, Norway. The farm is situated on the northern hills overlooking the lake Bjørheimsvatn. It is approximately northeast of the village of Tau and about south of the village of Fiskå. The city of Stavanger lies about southwest of Holta (via the Ryfylke Tunnel that goes under a large fjord).

On 9 August 1961, the Holtaheia Accident took place as a Vickers VC.1 Viking passenger aeroplane, G-AHPM operated by Cunard Eagle Airways, transporting schoolboys from The Archbishop Lanfranc School in Thornton Heath, London, crashed into the mountainside above the farm (Holtaheia). A total of 34 students, two teachers and three crew members were killed.

<doc id="539296" wikidata="Q177692" url="?curid=539296" title="Andrea Palladio">
<text>Andrea Palladio ( , ; ; 30 November 1508 – 19 August 1580) was an Italian Renaissance architect active in the Venetian Republic. Palladio, influenced by Roman and Greek architecture, primarily Vitruvius, is widely considered to be one of the most influential individuals in the history of architecture. While he designed churches and palaces, he was best known for country houses and villas. His teachings, summarized in the architectural treatise, &quot;The Four Books of Architecture&quot;, gained him wide recognition.

The city of Vicenza, with its 23 buildings designed by Palladio, and his 24 villas in the Veneto are listed by UNESCO as part of a World Heritage Site named City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto. The churches of Palladio are to be found within the &quot;Venice and its Lagoon&quot; UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Biography and major works==
Palladio was born on 30 November 1508 in Padua and was given the name Andrea di Pietro della Gondola (). His father, Pietro, called &quot;della Gondola&quot;, was a miller. From an early age, Andrea Palladio was introduced to the work of building. When he was thirteen, his father arranged for him to be an apprentice stonecutter for a period of six years in the workshop of Bartolomeo Cavazza da Sossano, a noted sculptor, whose projects included the altar in the Basilica del Carmine in Padua. Bartolomeo Cavazza is said to have imposed particularly hard working conditions: Palladio fled the workshop in April 1523 and went to Vicenza, but was forced to return to fulfil his contract. In 1524, when his contract was finished, he moved permanently to Vicenza, where he resided for most of his life. He became an assistant to a prominent stonecutter and stonemason, Giovanni di Giacomo da Porlezza in Pedemuro San Biagio, where he joined the guild of stonemasons and bricklayers. He was employed as a stonemason to make monuments and decorative sculptures.

His career was unexceptional until 1538–1539; when he had reached the age of thirty, he was employed by the humanist poet and scholar Gian Giorgio Trissino to rebuild his residence, the Villa Trissino at Cricoli. Trissino was deeply engaged in the study of ancient Roman architecture, particularly the work of Vitruvius, which had become available in print in 1486.

In 1540, Palladio received the formal title of architect. In 1541, he made a first trip to Rome, accompanied by Trissino, to see the classical monuments first-hand. He took another, longer trip to Rome with Trissino from the autumn of 1545 to the first months of 1546, and then another trip in 1546–1547. He also visited and studied the Roman works in Tivoli, Palestrina and Albano.

Trissino exposed Palladio to the history and arts of Rome, which gave him inspiration for his future buildings. In 1554 he would publish guides to the city&#x27;s ancient monuments and churches. Trissino also gave him the name by which he became known, Palladio, an allusion to the Greek goddess of wisdom Pallas Athene and to a character in a play by Trissino. The word &quot;Palladio&quot; means &quot;Wise one&quot;.

===Early villas===
His earliest work is held to be an addition to Villa Trissino at Cricoli, built before his first trip to Rome.

The earliest of his villas is generally considered to be the Villa Godi (begun 1537). This design already showed the originality of Palladio&#x27;s conception. A central block is flanked by two wings; the central block is recessed and the two wings are advanced and more prominent. Inside the central block, the &quot;piano nobile&quot; or main floor opened onto a loggia with a triple arcade, reached by a central stairway. On the reverse of the building, the rounded gallery projects outward to the garden. Palladio made numerous changes and additions over the years, adding lavish frescoes framed by classical columns in the Hall of the Muses of the Villa Godi in the 1550s.

In his early works in Vicenza in the 1540s, he sometimes emulated the work of his predecessor Giulio Romano, but in doing so he added his own ideas and variations. An example was the Palazzo Thiene in Vicenza, which Romano had begun but which, after Romano&#x27;s death, Palladio completed. It was his first construction of a large townhouse. He used Romano&#x27;s idea for windows by stone &quot;corbeaux&quot;, a ladder of stone blocks, but Palladio gave the heavy facade a new lightness and grace.

Several other villas of this time are attributed to Palladio, including the Villa Piovene (1539) and Villa Pisani (1542). Of the Villa Pisani, only the central structure of the original plan remains. The loggia is opened by three arcades beneath a frieze, beneath a pediment. The interior of the main hall has a barrel-vaulted ceiling lavishly decorated with murals of mythological themes.

===Urban palaces===
One of the most important works of his early Vicenza period is the Basilica Palladiana in Vicenza (1546), the palace of the city government. Palladio called it &quot;Basilica&quot;, explaining that the functions and form of a modern city hall resembled those of an ancient Roman Basilica. He did not construct the building from the ground up, but added two-story loggias to the exterior of an older building, which had been finished in 1459. For the facade, Palladio made use of two levels of arcades with rounded arches and columns, which opened the exterior of the building to the interior courtyard. The arcades were divided by columns and small circular windows (&quot;oculi&quot;), with a variety and richness of decorative detail. The building was not completed until 1617, after Palladio&#x27;s death. Its design had a notable influence on many buildings across Europe, from Portugal to Germany.

===Variations of the urban palace===
Palazzo Chiericati (begun in 1550) was another urban palace, built on a city square near the port in Vicenza. It was constructed after the Palazzo della Ragione, but it was very different in its plan and decoration. The two-story facade with a double loggia was divided into eleven spaces by rows of Doric columns, while a Doric cornice separated the lower level from the more important &quot;piano nobile&quot; above. The original plan of Palladio had the upper level identical to the lower level, but the owners wanted more space for ceremonies, so the central section on the &quot;piano nobile&quot; was brought forward and given windows with decorative frontons, doubling the interior space.

The Palazzo del Capitaniato, the offices of the Venetian governor of the region, is a later variation on the urban palace, built in Vicenza facing the Basilica Palladiana, and the finest of his late urban palaces. The four brick half-columns on the facade give a strong element of verticality, carefully balanced by the horizontal balustrades on the &quot;piano nobile&quot;, and on the projecting cornice at the top. The red brick of the walls and columns and the white stone of the balustrades and bases of the columns give another contrast. The facade was later given stucco sculptural decoration in the Mannerist style, which has considerably deteriorated. 


===Classical studies===
The success of the Basilica Palladiana propelled Palladio into the top ranks of the architects of Northern Italy. He had travelled to Rome in 1549, hoping to become a Papal architect, but the death of Pope Paul III ended that ambition. His patron, Gian Giorgio Trissino, died in 1550, but in the same year Palladio gained a new supporter, the powerful Venetian aristocrat Daniele Barbaro. Through Barbaro he became known to the major aristocratic families of Northern Italy. In addition to the Barbaros, the aristocratic Cornaro, Foscari, and Pisani families supported Palladio&#x27;s career, while he continued to construct a series of magnificent villas and palaces in Vicenza in his new classical style, including the Palazzo Chiericati in Vicenza, the Villa Pisani in Montagnana, and the Villa Cornaro in Piombino Dese.

Cardinal Barbaro brought Palladio to Rome and encouraged him to publish his studies of classical architecture. In 1554, he published the first of a series of books, &quot;Antiquities of Rome&quot;. He continued to compile and write his architectural studies, lavishly illustrated, which were published in full form in 1570 as &quot;I quattro libri dell&#x27;architettura&quot; (&quot;The Four Books of Architecture&quot;), in Venice. These books, reprinted in different languages and circulated widely in Europe, secured his reputation as the most influential figure in the renewal of classical architecture, a reputation which only continued to grow after his death.

===Rustic-suburban villas===
The type of villa invented by Palladio at the Villa Cornaro (begun 1553), located at Piombino Dese near Padua, was a mixture of &quot;villa rustica&quot; (country house), designed for country living, and a suburban villa, designed for entertaining and impressing. The distinction between the two parts was clearly expressed in the architecture. The central block is nearly square, with two low wings. The rear facade facing the garden has a spacious loggia, or covered terrace, supported by independent columns, on both the ground level and above on the &quot;piano nobile&quot;. The front facade facing the road has the same plan but with narrower loggias. The Hall of the Four Columns, the grand salon, could be entered by a grand stairway from either the front or back of the house. It has a very high ceiling, creating a large cubic space, and a roof supported by four Doric columns. Palladio placed niches in the walls of this salon, which were later filled with full-length statues of the ancestors of the owner. The more rustic functions of the house were carried on in the adjoining wings.

===Suburban villas===
The suburban villa was a particular type of building, a house near a city designed primarily for entertaining. Villa Barbaro (begun 1557) at Maser was an imposing suburban villa, built for the brothers Marcantonio and Daniele Barbaro, who were respectively occupied with politics and religious affairs in the Veneto, or Venice region. The long facade was perfectly balanced. The interior, following the professions of the brothers, had both classical and religious motifs. The central hall, The Hall of Olympus on the ground floor, was decorated with Roman gods and goddesses, but when one mounted the stairs, the long upper floor was in the form of a cross and Christian images predominate. The villa also has a series of remarkable frescos and ceiling paintings by Paolo Veronese combining mythical themes with scenes of everyday life. Behind the villa, Palladio created a remarkable nymphaeum, or Roman fountain, with statues of the gods and goddesses of the major rivers of Italy.

The most famous suburban villa constructed by Palladio was the Villa Capra &quot;La Rotonda&quot;, not far from Vicenza, begun in 1566 for Count Paolo Almerico, the canon of Pope Pius IV and Pope Pius V. The site is on a gentle wooded hilltop, with views of the countryside in all directions. The villa is perfectly symmetrical, with four identical facades with porticos around the domed centre. The height of the base is exactly the height of the attic, and the width of each portico is exactly half the length of the facade. The interior frescos were painted by Ludovico Dorigny in 1680–1687, and were not part of Palladio&#x27;s plan. The building was especially influential, particularly in England and the United States, where it inspired &quot;Neo-Palladianist&quot; buildings such as Mereworth Castle (1724) in Kent and Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Monticello in Virginia (1772).

Villa Foscari, also known as &quot;La Malcontenta&quot; for the name of the suburban village near Venice where it is located, faces the Brenta Canal and for this reason, unlike his other villas, it faces south to the canal. The villa is set upon a large base, and the central portico is flanked by two stairways. The upper and lower borders of the &quot;piano nobile&quot; are clearly indicated on the facade by darker reddish bands of stone. The same reddish border outlines the pediment over the portico and the attic, and appears on the rear facade. In another departure from traditional villas, the front doors lead directly into the main salon. The salon is let by a virtual wall of glass around the doorway of the south facade. The exterior and interior are closely integrated; the same classical elements own the facade, the columns and pediments, reappear in the interior, decorated with &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; murals on the walls and ceiling.

===Churches===
Daniele Barbaro and his younger brother Marcantonio introduced Palladio to Venice, where he developed his own style of religious architecture, distinct from and equally original as that of his villas. His first project in Venice was the cloister of the church of Santa Maria della Carità (1560–1561), followed by the refectory and then the interior of the San Giorgio Monastery (1560–1562). His style was rather severe compared with the traditional lavishness of Venetian Renaissance architecture. San Georgio Maggiore was later given a new facade by Vincenzo Scamozzi (1610), which integrated it more closely into the Venetian skyline. The original rigorous, perfectly balanced interior is the original work of Palladio.

In 1570, he was formally named &quot;Proto della Serenissima&quot; (chief architect of the Republic of Venice), following Jacopo Sansovino.


===Last church===
The Tempieto Barbaro, built at the end of his life, was one of his most accomplished works. It was begun in 1580 as an addition to the Villa Barbaro at Maser. It unites two classical forms, a circle and a Greek cross. The facade features a particularly imposing classical portico, like that of the Pantheon in Rome, placed before two tall bell towers, before an even higher cupola, which covers the church itself. The effect is to draw the eye upward, level by level. Inside, the circular interior is surrounded by eight half-columns and niches with statues. An open balustrade runs around the top of the interior wall, concealing the base of the dome itself, making it appear that the dome is suspended in the air. This idea would be adopted frequently in later Baroque churches. He achieves a perfect balance between the circle and the cross, and the horizontal and vertical elements, both on the facade and in the interior.

===Last work ===
The final work of Palladio was the Teatro Olimpico in the Piazza Matteotti in Vicenza, built for the theatrical productions of the Olympic Society of Vicenza, of which Palladio was a member. He was asked to produce a design and model, and construction began in February 1580. The back wall of the stage was in the form of an enormous triumphal arch divided into three levels, and three portals through which actors could appear and disappear. This wall was lavishly decorated with columns and niches filled with statuary. The view through the arches gave the illusion of looking down classical streets. The painted ceiling was designed to give the illusion of sitting under an open sky. Behind the hemicycle of seats, Palladio placed a row of Corinthian columns.

Palladio died on 19 August 1580, not long after the work was begun. It was completed, with a number of modifications, by Vincenzo Scamozzi and inaugurated in 1584 with a performance of the tragedy &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; by Sophocles.

==Personal life==
Very little is known of Palladio&#x27;s personal life. Documents show that he received a dowry in April 1534 from the family of his wife, Allegradonna, the daughter of a carpenter. They had four sons: Leonida, Marcantonio, Orazio and Silla, and a daughter, Zenobia. Two of the sons, Leonida and Orazio, died during a short period in 1572, greatly affecting their father. He died on 19 August 1580 at either Vicenza or Maser, and was buried in the church of Santa Corona in Vicenza. In 1844, a new tomb was built in a chapel dedicated to him in that cemetery.

==Influence==

Although all of Palladio&#x27;s buildings are found in a relatively small corner of Italy, they had an influence far beyond. They particularly inspired neoclassical architects in Britain and in the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries. While he designed churches and urban palaces, his plans for villas and country houses were particularly admired and copied.

His books with their detailed illustrations and plans were especially influential. His first book, &quot;L&#x27;Antichida di Roma&quot; (&quot;Antiquities of Rome&quot;) was published in 1554. He then made architectural drawings to illustrate a book by his patron, Daniele Barbaro, a commentary on Vitruvius. His most famous work was &quot;I quattro libri dell&#x27;architettura&quot; (&quot;The Four Books of Architecture&quot;), published in 1570, which set out rules others could follow. The first book includes studies of decorative styles, classical orders, and materials. He illustrated a rich variety of columns, arcades, pediments, pilasters and other details which were soon adapted and copied. The second book included Palladio&#x27;s town and country house designs and classical reconstructions. The third book had bridge and basilica designs, city planning designs, and classical halls. The fourth book included information on the reconstruction of ancient Roman temples. The books were translated into many languages, and went through many editions, well into the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

===France and Germany===
Palladio&#x27;s style inspired several works by Claude Nicolas Ledoux in France, including the Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans, begun in 1775. In Germany, Johann von Goethe in his &quot;Italian Journey&quot; described Palladio as a genius, declaring that his unfinished Convent of Santa Maria della Carità was the most perfect existing work of architecture. The German architects David Gilly and his son Friedrich Gilly were also admirers of Palladio, and constructed palaces for the King of Prussia Frederick-William III in the style, including the Paretz Palace. Friedrich Gilly&#x27;s work, the National Theatre in Berlin (1798), built for Frederick the Great was in the style. Most of the buildings were destroyed during World War II.

===England===

Palladio&#x27;s work was especially popular in England, where the villa style was adapted for country houses. The first English architect to adapt Palladio&#x27;s work was Inigo Jones, who made a long trip to Vicenza and returned full of Palladian ideas. His first major work in the style was the Queen&#x27;s House at Greenwich (1616–1635), modelled after Palladio&#x27;s villas.

Wilton House is another adaptation of Palladio&#x27;s villa plans. It had a particularly famous feature, the Palladio Bridge, designed around 1736. The bridge was extremely popular, and copies were made for other houses, including Stowe House. Another variation, the Marble Bridge, was made for Empress Catherine the Great of Russia for her gardens at Tsarskoe Selo near Saint Petersburg, Russia.

Other English architects, including Elizabeth Wilbraham, and Christopher Wren also embraced the Palladian style. Another English admirer was the architect, Richard Boyle, 4th Earl of Cork, also known as Lord Burlington, who, with William Kent, designed Chiswick House. The Italian-born Giacomo Leoni also constructed Palladian houses in England.

===United States===
The influence of Palladio also reached the United States, where the architecture and symbols of the Roman Republic were adapted for the architecture and institutions of the newly independent nation. The Massachusetts governor and architect Thomas Dawes also admired the style and used it when rebuilding Harvard Hall at Harvard University in 1766. Palladio&#x27;s villas inspired Monticello, the residence of the third U.S. President, Thomas Jefferson, himself an architect. Jefferson organized a competition for the first United States Capitol building. It was won by William Thornton with a design inspired in part by Palladio and La Rotonda. The One Hundred Eleventh Congress of the United States of America called him the &quot;Father of American Architecture&quot; (Congressional Resolution no. 259 of 6 December 2010). His influence can also be seen in American plantation buildings. 
===Archives===
More than 330 of Palladio&#x27;s original drawings and sketches still survive in the collections of the Royal Institute of British Architects, most of which originally were owned by Inigo Jones. Jones collected a significant number of these on his Grand Tour of 1613–1614, while some were a gift from Henry Wotton. The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc., a nonprofit membership organization, was founded in 1979 to research and promote understanding of Palladio&#x27;s influence in the architecture of the United States.

==Palladian style==

Palladio is known as one of the most influential architects in Western architecture. His architectural works have &quot;been valued for centuries as the quintessence of High Renaissance calm and harmony&quot;.

The basic elements of Italian Renaissance architecture, including Doric columns, lintels, cornices, loggias, pediments and domes had already been used in the 15th century or earlier, before Palladio. They had been skillfully brought together by Brunelleschi in the Pazzi Chapel (1420) and the Medici-Riccardi Palace (1444–1449). At the beginning of the High Renaissance in the early 16th century, Bramante used these elements together in the Tempietto in Rome (1502), which combined a dome and a central plan based on a Greek Cross. The architect Baldassare Peruzzi had introduced the first Renaissance suburban villas, based on a Roman model and surrounded by gardens. The Farnese Palace in Rome (1530–1580) by Sangallo introduced a new kind of Renaissance palace, with monumental blocks, ornate cornices, lateral wings and multiple stairways. Michelangelo had made a plan for a central dome at Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica and added a new loggia to the facade of the Farnese Palace. All of these plans already existed before Palladio; his contribution was to refine, simplify, and use them in innovative ways.

The style of Palladio employed a classical repertoire of elements in new ways. He clearly expressed the function of each part of the building by its form, particularly elevating and giving precedence to the &quot;piano nobile&quot;, the ceremonial floor, of his villas and palaces. As much as possible he simplified the forms, as he did at Villa Capra &quot;La Rotonda&quot;, surrounding a circular dome and interior with perfectly square facades, and placing the building pedestal to be more visible and more dramatic.

Palladio was inspired by classical Roman architecture, but he did not slavishly imitate it. He chose elements and assembled them in innovative ways appropriate to the site and function of the building. His buildings were often placed on pedestals, raising them and making them more visible, and so they could offer a view. The villas very often had loggias, covered arcades or walkways on the outside of upper levels, which gave a view of the scenery or city below, and also gave variety to the facade. When he designed his rustic villas and suburban villas, he paid particular attention to the site, integrating them as much as possible into nature, either by sites on hilltops or looking out at gardens or rivers.

The Serlian window, or Venetian window, also known as a Palladian window, was another common feature of his style, which he used both for windows and the arches of the loggias of his buildings. It consists of an arched window flanked by two smaller square windows, divided by two columns or pilasters and often topped by a small entablature and by a small circular window or hole, called an oculus. These particular features originally appeared in the triumphal arches of Rome, and had been used in the earlier Renaissance by Bramante, but Palladio used them in novel ways, particularly in the facade of the Basilica Palladiana and in the Villa Pojana. They also became a common feature of later Palladian buildings in England and elsewhere.

In his later work, particularly the Palazzo Valmarana and the Palazzo del Capitaniato in Vicenza, his style became more ornate and more decorative, with more sculptural decoration on the facade, tending toward Mannerism. His buildings in this period were examples of the transition beginning to what would become Baroque architecture.

==Characteristics==

Palladio&#x27;s architecture was not dependent on expensive materials, which must have been an advantage to his more financially pressed clients. Many of his buildings are of brick covered with stucco. Stuccoed brickwork was always used in his villa designs in order to give the appearance of a classical Roman structure.

His success as an architect is based not only on the beauty of his work, but also on its harmony with the culture of his time. His success and influence came from the integration of extraordinary aesthetic quality with expressive characteristics that resonated with his clients&#x27; social aspirations. His buildings served to communicate, visually, their place in the social order of their culture. This powerful integration of beauty and the physical representation of social meanings is apparent in three major building types: the urban palazzo, the agricultural villa, and the church.

Relative to his trips to Rome, Palladio developed three main palace types by 1556. In 1550, the Palazzo Chiericati was completed. The proportions for the building were based on musical ratios for adjacent rooms. The building was centralized by a tripartite division of a series of columns or colonnades. In 1552, the Palazzo Porto located in Vicenza was rebuilt incorporating the Roman Renaissance element for façades. A colonnade of Corinthian columns surrounded a main court. The Palazzo Antonini in Udine, constructed in 1556, had a centralized hall with four columns and service spaces placed relatively toward one side. He used styles of incorporating the six columns, supported by pediments, into the walls as part of the façade. This technique had been applied in his villa designs as well. Palladio experimented with the plan of the Palazzo Porto by incorporating it into the Palazzo Thiene. It was an earlier project from 1545 to 1550 and remained uncompleted due to elaborate elevations in his designs. He used Mannerist elements such as stucco surface reliefs and large columns, often extending two stories high.
In his urban structures, he developed a new improved version of the typical early Renaissance palazzo (exemplified by the Palazzo Strozzi). Adapting a new urban palazzo type created by Bramante in the House of Raphael, Palladio found a powerful expression of the importance of the owner and his social position. The main living quarters of the owner on the second level were clearly distinguished in importance by the use of a pedimented classical portico, centred and raised above the subsidiary and utilitarian ground level (illustrated in the Palazzo Porto and the Palazzo Valmarana). The tallness of the portico was achieved by incorporating the owner&#x27;s sleeping quarters on the third level, within a giant two-story classical colonnade, a motif adapted from Michelangelo&#x27;s Capitoline buildings in Rome. The elevated main floor level became known as the &quot;piano nobile&quot;, and is still referred to as the &quot;first floor&quot; in Europe.

Palladio also established an influential new building format for the agricultural villas of the Venetian aristocracy. Palladio&#x27;s approach to his villa designs was not relative to his experience in Rome. His designs were based on practicality and employed few reliefs. He consolidated the various stand-alone farm outbuildings into a single impressive structure, arranged as a highly organized whole, dominated by a strong centre and symmetrical side wings, as illustrated at Villa Barbaro. In the project of the Villa Barbaro, Palladio most likely was also engaged in the interior decoration. Alongside the painter Paolo Veronese, he invented the complex and sophisticated illusionistic landscape paintings that cover the walls of various rooms.

The Villa Capra &quot;La Rotonda&quot; of 1552, outside Vicenza, was constructed as a summer house with views from all four sides. The plan has centralized circular halls with wings and porticos expanding on all four sides. Palladio began to implement the classical temple front into his design of façades for villas. He felt that to make an entry appear grand, the Roman temple front would be the most suitable style. The Palladian villa configuration often consists of a centralized block raised on an elevated podium, accessed by grand steps, and flanked by lower service wings, as at Villa Foscari and Villa Badoer. This format, with the quarters of the owners at the elevated centre of their own world, found resonance as a prototype for Italian villas and later for the country estates of the British nobility (such as Lord Burlington&#x27;s Chiswick House, Vanbrugh&#x27;s Blenheim, Walpole&#x27;s Houghton Hall, and Adam&#x27;s Kedleston Hall and Paxton House in Scotland). His villas were used by a capitalist gentry who developed an interest in agriculture and land. The configuration was a perfect architectural expression of their worldview, clearly expressing their perceived position in the social order of the times. His influence was extended worldwide into the British colonies.

Palladio developed his own prototype for the plan of the villas that was flexible to moderate in scale and function. The Palladian villa format was easily adapted for a democratic worldview, as may be seen in Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Monticello and his arrangement for the University of Virginia. It also may be seen applied as recently as 1940 in Pope&#x27;s National Gallery in Washington D.C., where the public entry to the world of high culture occupies the exalted centre position. The rustication of exposed basement walls of Victorian residences is a late remnant of the Palladian format, clearly expressed as a podium for the main living space for the family.

Similarly, Palladio created a new configuration for the design of Catholic churches that established two interlocking architectural orders, each clearly articulated, yet delineating a hierarchy of a larger order overriding a lesser order. This idea was in direct coincidence with the rising acceptance of the theological ideas of St. Thomas Aquinas, who postulated the notion of two worlds existing simultaneously: the divine world of faith, and the earthly world of humans. Palladio created an architecture which made a visual statement communicating the idea of two superimposed systems, as illustrated at San Francesco della Vigna. In a time when religious dominance in Western culture was threatened by the rising power of science and secular humanists, this architecture found great favor with the Catholic Church as a clear statement of the proper relationship of the earthly and the spiritual worlds.

Aside from Palladio&#x27;s designs, his publications further contributed to Palladianism. During the second half of his life, Palladio published many books on architecture, most famously, &quot;I quattro libri dell&#x27;architettura&quot; (&quot;The Four Books of Architecture&quot;, Venice, 1570).

<text>Spin Boldak () is a city in Kandahar Province of Afghanistan, serving as the capital of Spin Boldak District. Its current mayor is Lutfullah Latifi.

Spin Boldak sits along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. It is linked by a highway with the city of Kandahar to the north, and with Chaman and Quetta in Pakistan to the south. The Wesh-Chaman border crossing is located in the southeast of the city.

The area of Spin Boldak and Chaman is populated by Pashtuns, particularly the Noorzai and Achakzai Pashtuns. 

==History==
The city began to develop after the United States invaded Afghanistan in October 2001. Before that the location was a small border town. In January 2006, &quot;a suicide bomber on a motorbike killed at least 20 people and wounded 20 more,&quot; according to one report. &quot;The attacker drove the vehicle into a crowd watching a wrestling match and detonated a bomb,&quot; said Kandahar provincial Gov. Asadullah Khalid. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.

Spin Boldak was the site of a suicide bombing in February 2008 that killed 38 Afghans and injured several Canadian soldiers.

In April 2010, three nephews of the former governor of Spin Boldak district, Hajji (or Haji) Fazluddin Agha, aged 15, 13 and 12, were killed in a bomb attack. The bomb was attached to a donkey which was led to the checkpoint in front of the former governor&#x27;s home and detonated by remote control. Hajji Fazluddin Agha, according to the report, is of one of President Hamid Karzai’s most important political allies in Kandahar, and had also served as Mr. Karzai&#x27;s top campaign official in Kandahar Province. He was unhurt in the bombing, but two bystanders and two policemen were wounded.

On 14 July 2021, Taliban forces as part of the 2021 Taliban offensive captured Spin Boldak along with the border post with Pakistan. The Taliban immediately took over border duties by regulating movement of people and goods between Spin Boldak and the Wesh–Chaman border crossing. It was at this border crossing on 15 July 2021, the Indian photo-journalist Danish Siddiqui was killed by the Taliban and his body mutilated 

==Climate==
With an influence from the local steppe climate, Spin Boldak features a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSh&quot;), characterised by little precipitation throughout the year. The average temperature in Spin Boldak is 19.7 °C, while the annual precipitation averages 217 mm. July is the hottest month of the year with an average temperature of 31.8 °C. The coldest month January has an average temperature of 6.9 °C.

== Railway ==

In 1891 the British extended the Indian Railways system (now Pakistan Railways) to the border town of Chaman via the Khojak Tunnel from Qilla Abdullah, from the east and thence south. The rails were not extended into Afghanistan to the north and west for political reasons. Spin Boldak, Afghanistan, is less than from Chaman in Balochistan province of Pakistan.

Over much of the last century, there have been proposals to extend the Chaman line to Afghanistan and possibly beyond, passing through Spin Boldak. These proposals have the support of the current Afghan government. In July 2010, Pakistan and Afghanistan signed a Memorandum of understanding for going ahead with the laying of rail tracks between the two countries.

* 4 flutes (doubling on 3 piccolos), 4 oboes (doubling on 3 cor anglais), 4 B clarinets (doubling on 3 B bass clarinets), 4 bassoons (doubling on 1 contrabassoon)
* 4 horns, 4 trumpets (doubling on 1 optional piccolo trumpet), 2 trombones, bass trombone, tuba. 
* 2 timpani players (doubling rototoms); 7 percussionists (including 2 players on marimba; 2 players on vibraphone; 2 players on xylophones, doubling glockenspiels; maracas paired with sticks; 2 bass drums, and medium tam-tam).
* 2 pianos, played by four musicians (doubling 3 synthesizers)
* The strings (12-12-9-9-6) are broken into three sections of (4-4-3-3-2) seated by their section with the first set of 16 players stage right, the next 16 center stage, and the last 16 stage left

There is also a reduced orchestration, prepared by Reich himself, for a chorus of 10 voices (3 sopranos, 3 altos, 2 tenors, 2 basses), accompanied by:
* 4 flutes (doubling on 3 piccolos)
* 2 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones (all brass optional)
* 4 pianos, all doubling synthesizer
* 12 solo strings, broken into three quartets, plus one or two basses

No reductions are made in the percussion.

== Form ==
; I : Fast Tempo (quarter = 192 in 4/4 time)
; II : Moderate Tempo
; IIIA : Slow Tempo
; IIIB : Moderate Tempo
; IIIC : Slow Tempo
; IV : Moderate Tempo
; V : Fast Tempo

The tempi between two sections are related by a ratio of 3:2, introduced at the end of each section by either tuplet or dotted rhythms, respectively. So, I and V have 192 bpm; II, IIIB, and IV have 128 bpm; IIIA and C have 85 bpm.

Sections I and V have the same harmonic structure. Sections II and IV have both the same harmonic structure and the same words, and likewise Sections IIIA and IIIC.

== Relation to other Reich pieces ==

The piece opens similarly to many of Reich&#x27;s other works: a piano or mallet instrument pulsing on the beat, with another piano or marimba soon fading in on the offbeats (&quot;Music for 18 Musicians&quot;, &quot;Sextet&quot;, &quot;Three Movements for Orchestra&quot;). Also characteristic of several of Reich&#x27;s pieces, such as &quot;New York Counterpoint&quot;, &quot;Electric Counterpoint&quot;, &quot;Sextet&quot;, &quot;Music for 18 Musicians&quot;, &quot;Three Movements for Orchestra&quot;, the exposition of the pulse is followed by pulsed notes in the choir and orchestra fading in and out over the course of a chord progression. Also, the first movement prominently features a repeated rhythm found in several of the aforementioned works (in &quot;The Desert Music&quot;, however, the fourth and fifth note are tied together):

Twice in Section IIIC, the strings begin playing a slightly modified section from Reich&#x27;s &quot;New York Counterpoint&quot;.

<text>Tehillim is a composition by American composer Steve Reich, written in 1981.

==Title==
The title comes from the Hebrew word for &quot;psalms&quot;, and the work is the first to reflect Reich&#x27;s Jewish heritage. It is in four parts, marked fast, fast, slow, and fast.

&quot;Tehillim&quot; is the setting of Psalms 19:2–5 (19:1–4 in Christian translations); Psalm 34:13–15 (34:12–14); Psalm 18:26–27 (18:25–26); and finally Psalm 150:4–6. The four parts of the work are based on these four texts, respectively. &quot;Literally translated [the word &quot;Tehillim&quot;] means &#x27;praises&#x27;,&quot; writes Steve Reich in his composer&#x27;s notes, &quot;and it derives from the three letter Hebrew root ‘hey, lamed, lamed’ (hll) which is also the root of halleluyah.&quot; 

== Instrumentation and the music ==

In its standard chamber version &quot;Tehillim&quot; is scored for four women&#x27;s voices (one high soprano, two lyric sopranos and one alto), piccolo, flute, oboe, English horn, two clarinets, six percussion (playing 4 small tuned tambourines without jingles, clapping, maracas, marimba, vibraphone and crotales), two electronic organs, two violins, viola, cello and bass. The voices, winds and strings are amplified in performance. There is also a version for orchestra using full strings and winds, with only the voices amplified.

The first and longest movement is based on canons, while the second, performed without pause, utilizes a theme and variations structure. The third movement, the only slow movement, features call-and-response, and continues without pause into the finale, which recapitulates in turn the structures of the first three movements.

A typical performance takes about 30 minutes.

== Analysis ==

Tehillim was the first major composition by Reich to reference explicitly his new-found interest in his Jewish heritage, and his Judaism as such. However, although this is obviously central to the work, and although it would not be until 2004, with &quot;You Are (Variations),&quot; that Reich would again set Jewish scriptures to music, the real difference lies in the formal aspects of &quot;Tehillim&quot;.

Typically, Reich&#x27;s music is characterised by a steady pulse and the repetition of a comparatively small amount of melodic material emanating from a clear tonal centre (a style of writing which is called &#x27;minimalist&#x27;). Both aspects are certainly to be identified in &quot;Tehillim&quot; (the composition in no way marks a complete aesthetic break for Reich), for example in the quick, unchanging tempo of the first two parts, which are played one after another without a break, and the close four-part canons of the first and fourth parts. However, these aspects together constitute only the broad outlines of the work; how they are presented is markedly different from his early work.

These differences are a direct consequence of the need felt by the composer to, &quot;set the text in accordance with its rhythm and meaning&quot;.

There is no fixed metre or metric pattern in &quot;Tehillim&quot;. The rhythm of the music comes directly from the rhythm of the Hebrew text. 
Secondly, the musical setting of lengthy 3-4 line texts results in the composition of extended melodies at that point atypical for Reich. &quot;Though an entire melody may be repeated either as the subject of a canon or variation, this is actually closer to what one finds throughout the history of Western music&quot;. As such, this second aspect of extended melody contributes to the appearance of structures not without precedent in Western musical history. 

&quot;The use of extended melodies, imitative counterpoint, functional harmony and full orchestration may well suggest renewed interest in Classical, or more accurately Baroque, and earlier Western musical practice. The non-vibrato, non-operatic vocal production will also remind listeners a singing style derived from outside the tradition of &#x27;Western art music&#x27;. However, the overall sound of &quot;Tehillim,&quot; and in particular, the intricately interlocking percussion writing which, together with the text, marks this music as unique by introducing a basic musical element that one does not find in earlier Western musical practice including the music of this century. &quot;Tehillim&quot; may thus be heard as traditional and new at the same time&quot;.

None of the writing is informed by the sound or structure (in spite of the composer&#x27;s recent study of Hebrew cantillation) of Jewish music generally or any existing tradition for singing the Biblical text. Indeed, a major factor in Reich&#x27;s choosing the Psalms was that, &quot;the oral tradition for Psalm singing in the Western synagogues has been lost. This meant I was free to compose the melodies for &quot;Tehillim&quot; without a living oral tradition to imitate or ignore.&quot;

<doc id="539348" wikidata="Q457167" url="?curid=539348" title="West Ukrainian People's Republic">
<text>The West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic (; see other names) was a short-lived polity that controlled most of Eastern Galicia from November 1918 to July 1919. It included major cities of Lviv, Ternopil, Kolomyia, Drohobych, Boryslav, Stanyslaviv and right-bank Peremyshl. Apart from lands of Eastern Galicia, it also claimed the northern part of Bukovyna and the Carpathian Ruthenia. Politically, the Ukrainian National Democratic Party (the precursor of the interwar Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance) dominated the legislative assembly, guided by varying degrees of Greek Catholic, liberal and socialist ideology. Other parties represented included the Ukrainian Radical Party and the Christian Social Party.

The ZUNR emerged as a breakaway state amid the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, and in January 1919 nominally united with the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic (UPR) as its autonomous Western Oblast. Poland had also claimed this territory, and by July occupied most of it and forced the West Ukrainian government into exile. When the UPR decided late the same year that it would trade the territory for an alliance with Poland against Soviet Russia, the exiled West Ukrainian government broke with the UPR. The exiled government continued its claim until it dissolved in 1923.

The coat of arms of the ZUNR was azure, a golden lion rampant. The colours of the flag were blue and yellow, with the blue in a much lighter shade than in the modern Ukrainian flag.

== Name ==
Until November 13, 1918, the state was officially known as the Ukrainian State. After the Unification Act on January 22, 1919, the state became a part of the unified Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic and simultaneously became an autonomous region, known as the Western Oblast of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic.

The name of the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic is often abbreviated as ZUNR (as a direct translation of the Ukrainian abbreviation — ЗУНР). Sometimes it can also be abbreviated as WUPR (from &quot;West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic&quot;) or WUNR (from &quot;West Ukrainian National Republic&quot;).

== History ==
===Background===
According to the Austro-Hungarian census of 1910, the territory claimed by the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic had about 5.4 million people. Of these, 3,291,000 (approximately 60%) were Ukrainians, 1,351,000 (approximately 25%) were Poles, 660,000 (approximately 12%) were Jews, and the rest included Rusyns, Germans, Hungarians, Romanians, Czechs, Slovaks, Romani, Armenians and others. The cities and towns of this largely rural region were mostly populated by Poles and Jews, while the Ukrainians dominated the countryside. Out of this region&#x27;s 44 territorial divisions, Poles were a majority in only one — Lviv county. This would prove problematic for the Ukrainians, because largest city and proclaimed capital Lviv had 49.4% Polish population compared to 19.9% Ukrainian population; and was considered by Poland to be one of its most important cities.

The oil reserves near Lviv at Drohobych and Boryslav in the upper Dniester River were among the largest in Europe. Rail connections to Russian-ruled Ukraine or Romania were few; these included Brody on a line from Lviv to the upper Styr River, Pidvolochysk on a line from Ternopil to Proskuriv in Podolia, and a line along the Prut from Kolomyia to Chernivtsi in Bukovina.

===Independence and struggle for existence===

The West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic was proclaimed on 1 November 1918. The Ukrainian National Rada (a council consisting of all Ukrainian representatives from both houses of the Austrian parliament and from the provincial diets in Galicia and Bukovina) planned to declare the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic on 3 November 1918, but moved the date forward to 1 November due to reports that the Polish Liquidation Committee was to transfer from Kraków to Lviv. Shortly after the republic proclaimed independence from the Austro-Hungarian Empire a popular uprising took place in Lviv, where half of the residents were Polish and did not want to be part of a non-Polish state. A few weeks later Lviv&#x27;s rebellious Poles received support from Poland. On 9 November, Polish forces attempted to seize the Drohobych oil fields by surprise but were driven back, outnumbered by the Ukrainians. The resulting stalemate saw the Poles retaining control over Lviv and a narrow strip of land around a railway linking the city to Poland, while the rest of eastern Galicia remained under the control of the West Ukrainian National Republic. 

The Polish population was hostile to the newly formed West Ukrainian state. They considered it a rule &quot;by bayonet, cudgel, and axe&quot;. Polish officials resigned en masse, which undermined the Republic&#x27;s ability to lead an effective administration. Poles dominated the urban areas and started an uprising against the Ukrainian rule not only in Lviv, but also in Drohobych, Peremyshl, Sambir and Yaroslav. This made the West Ukrainian government unable to exert control over the western half of its territory, and made the Polish offensive possible.

Two smaller states west of the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic also declared independence as result of the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Komańcza Republic, an association of 30 Lemko villages based around Komańcza in eastern Lemko Region, existed between 4 November 1918 and 23 January 1919. Being pro-Ukrainian it planned to unite with the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, but was suppressed by the Polish government. On 5 December 1918, the Lemko-Rusyn Republic, centred around the village of Florynka, declared independence. Western Ukrainian Russophiles sentiment prevailed among its inhabitants, who were opposed to a union with the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic and instead sought unification with Russia.

An agreement to unite western Ukraine with the rest of Ukraine was made as early as 1 December 1918. The government of the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic officially united with the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic on 22 January 1919, after which the former was known as the Western Oblast of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic. This was mostly a symbolic act, however. During the Polish–Ukrainian War, the West Ukrainian army was able to hold off Poland for approximately nine months, but by July 1919, Polish forces had taken over most of the territory claimed by the Western Oblast.

Since western Ukraine had a different tradition in its legal, social and political norms, it was to be autonomous within a united Ukraine. Furthermore, western Ukrainians retained their own Ukrainian Galician Army and government structure. Despite the formal union, the Western Ukrainian Republic and the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic fought in separate wars. The former was preoccupied with a conflict with Poland, while the latter struggled with Soviet and Russian forces.

Relations between the western Ukrainian polity and the Kyiv-based Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic were at times strained. The leadership of the former tended to be more conservative in orientation. Well-versed in the culture of the Austrian parliamentary system and an orderly approach to government, they looked upon the socialist revolutionary attitude of their Kyiv-based peers with some dismay and with the concern that the social unrest in the East would spread to Galicia. Likewise, the West Ukrainian troops were more disciplined while those of Kyiv&#x27;s Ukrainian People&#x27;s Army were more chaotic and prone to committing pogroms, something actively opposed by the western Ukrainians. The poor discipline in Kyiv&#x27;s army and the insubordination of its officers shocked the Galician delegates sent to Kyiv.

The national movement in western Ukraine was as strong as in other eastern European countries, and the Ukrainian government was able to mobilize over 100,000 men, 40,000 of whom were battle-ready. Despite the strength of the Ukrainian nationalist forces, they received little support and enthusiasm from the local Ukrainian population; in general, the attitude was often that of indifference, and the male Ukrainian population often tried to avoid service in its military.

===Exile and diplomacy===

Part of the defeated army found refuge in Czechoslovakia and became known there under the name &quot;Ukrajinská brigáda&quot; (Czech). On 16 July 1919, the remaining army consisting of about 50,000 soldiers, crossed into the territory of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic and continued the struggle for Ukrainian independence there.

The same month, the Western Oblast established a government-in-exile in the city of Kamianets-Podilskyi. Relations between the exiled West Ukrainian government and the Kyiv-based government continued to deteriorate, in part because the Western Ukrainians saw the Poles as the main enemy (with the Russians a potential ally) while Symon Petliura in Kyiv considered the Poles a potential ally against his Russian enemies. In response to the Kyiv government&#x27;s diplomatic talks with Poland, the Western Ukrainian government sent a delegation to the Soviet 12th Army, but ultimately rejected Soviet conditions for an alliance. In August 1919, Kost Levytsky, head of the Western Ukrainian state secretariat, proposed an alliance with Anton Denikin&#x27;s White Russians which would involve guaranteed autonomy within a Russian state. Western Ukrainian diplomats in Paris sought contact with Russian counterparts in that city. The Russian Whites had mixed views of this proposed alliance. On the one hand, they were wary of the Galicians&#x27; Russophobia and concerned about the effect of such an alliance on their relationship with Poland. On the other hand, the Russians respected the discipline and training of the Galician soldiers and understood that an agreement with the Western Ukrainians would deprive Kyiv&#x27;s Ukrainian People&#x27;s Army, at war with the Russian Whites, of its best soldiers. In November 1919 the Ukrainian Galician Army, without authorization from their government, signed a ceasefire with the White Russians and placed their army under White Russian authority.

In talks with Kyiv&#x27;s Directorate government, Western Ukrainian president Petrushevych argued that the Whites would be defeated anyway but that the alliance with them would strengthen relations with the Western powers, who supported the Whites and would help the Ukrainian military forces for their later struggle against the victorious Soviets. Such arguments were condemned by Petliura. As a result, Petrushevych recognized that the West Ukrainian government could no longer work with Petliura&#x27;s Directorate and on 15 November the West Ukrainian government left for exile in Vienna. The Directorate informed Poland on 2 December that it had no interest in western Ukraine. The West Ukrainian government-in-exile then &quot;rejected the joint institutions&quot; with the Directorate and on 20 December unilaterally repealed the Unification Act. The exiled government resumed the name West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic at the beginning of 1920.

====Barthelemy Line====

In at attempt to stop the Polish-Ukrainian War, a French general proposed a demarcation line, known as the , that was supposed to cease the fighting between the Polish and West Ukrainian army.

In 1918, the Entente countries sought to form a common anti-Bolshevik front, which was to include the Polish, White Russian, Romanian and Ukrainian armies. The outbreak of Polish-Ukrainian hostilities in Lviv on 1 November thwarted these plans, so the Entente states began to press both the Poles and Galicians to seek a settlement and adopt the demarcation line proposed by the allied states.

On 19 January 1919, by the order of General Franchet d&#x27;Esperey, a peacekeeping mission under the command of General Joseph Barthelemy arrived in Kraków. Initially, the mission familiarised itself with the Polish position, which opted for the Bug- line. It then travelled to Lviv, meeting with the Ukrainian delegation. The Ukrainians opted for the San line as a future demarcation line.

In this situation, General Barthelemy presented his compromise proposal on 28 January 1919. The armistice line was to run along the Bug River to Kamionka Strumiłłowa, then along the border of the districts to Bóbrka, then along the Bóbrka-Wybranka railway line, westwards to Mikołajów (leaving Mikołajów itself on the Ukrainian side), then along the railway line Lviv-Stryi to the border of the disputed territory in the Eastern Carpathians. The Stryi-Lavochne railway line was to remain in Ukrainian hands. This was to be a temporary line, until the matter was settled by the Paris Peace Conference.

The Polish side accepted this solution, but the Ukrainian delegation insisted on the &#x27;San line&#x27;. As a result of the Ukrainian disapproval, the Entente delegation made another attempt at mediation. This was carried out by the subcommittee set up on 15 February 1919 and headed by Joseph Noulens. The sub-commission consisted of General Joseph Barthelemy (France) as chairman, Colonel Adrian Carton de Wiart (UK), Dr Robert Howard Lord (United States) and Major Giovanni Stabile (Italy). The subcommittee presented a draft truce convention on 15 February 1919. The truce, along the Barthelemy Line, was to be purely military and not affect the decisions of the Paris Peace Conference in any way. An integral part of the convention was to be a supplementary treaty concerning the . It was to remain on the Polish side of the truce line under the management of an international commission, with 50% of oil production to be transferred to the Ukrainian side. Poland and ZUNR were only to be able to record the volume of production and pay for oil supplies. The project secured Entente interests in the oil basin and was the first step towards its neutralisation. At the time of the proposal, the territory of the basin was under the control of the Ukrainian Galician Army. For the West Ukrainian government, the terms of the Armistice Convention were unfavourable; however, they offered a chance to compromise with Poland and obtain international recognition of the Ukrainian state by the Entente.

The commission succeeded in getting the armistice treaty signed on 24 February 1919, and presented its proposals to the parties on 28 February, which was rejected by the West Ukrainian side. As a result of the failure to agree on the demarcation line, Polish-Ukrainian hostilities resumed on 2 March.

==== Treaty of Warsaw (1920) ====
In April 1920, Józef Piłsudski and Symon Petliura agreed in the Treaty of Warsaw to a border on the river Zbruch, officially recognizing Polish control over the disputed territory of Eastern Galicia. In exchange for agreeing to a border along the Zbruch River, recognizing the recent Polish territorial gains in western Ukraine, as well as the western portions of Volhynian Governorate, Kholm Governorate, and other territories (Article II), Poland recognized the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic as an independent state (Article I) with borders as defined by Articles II and III and under otaman Petliura&#x27;s leadership.

Neither the Polish government in Warsaw nor the exiled Western Ukrainian government agreed to this treaty.

==== Autonomous status ====
The Western Ukrainians continued pressing their interests during the negotiations following World War I at the Paris Peace Conference. These efforts ultimately resulted in the League of Nations declaring on 23 February 1921 that Galicia lay outside the territory of Poland, that Poland did not have the mandate to establish administrative control in that country, and that Poland was merely the occupying military power of Eastern Galicia, whose fate would be determined by the Council of Ambassadors at the League of Nations.

After a long series of further negotiations, on 14 March 1923 it was decided that eastern Galicia would be incorporated into Poland &quot;taking into consideration that Poland has recognized that in regard to the eastern part of Galicia ethnographic conditions fully deserve its autonomous status.&quot; The following day, the government of the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic disbanded. The Polish government reneged on its promise of autonomy for eastern Galicia.

==The Entente powers and the issue of Eastern Galicia==
The Paris Peace Conference approved the provisional administration of the Second Polish Republic on the territory of Eastern Galicia on 25 June 1919. The Entente states and the bodies appointed by them (Council of Ambassadors, Council of the League of Nations) recognised Eastern Galicia as disputed territory not belonging to the Polish state until 14 March 1923, over which sovereignty was to be exercised by the Entente states under the peace treaty with Austria. The Entente also never recognised the Western Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic. With regard to the territory of eastern Galicia, it attempted to introduce a makeshift solution, a long-lasting (25 years) mandate for Poland to administer Galicia, with the territory being granted the status of autonomy. The expiry of the mandate period was to be followed by a plebiscite. The political intention of the Entente states at the time was to preserve the territory of eastern Galicia for White Russia. Poland opposed these ideas, while at the same time pursuing a policy of establishing its own governance on the disputed territory, integrating it into the Polish state.

Following the consolidation of Soviet power in Russia and the restoration of non-Bolshevik Russia becoming unachievable, the Council of Ambassadors recognised the sovereignty of the Second Polish Republic over the territory of Eastern Galicia on 15 March 1923, with the reservation that Poland introduce autonomous status for this territory, a surrogate for which was the Act on Provincial Self-Government of September 1922, stating in its very title the special character of the territory of Eastern Galicia within the Polish state.

Following a decision by the Council of Ambassadors, the West Ukrainian government in exile led by Sydir Holubovych in Vienna dissolved on 15 March 1923, and most of its members returned to Poland, being actively involved in the political and social life of the Ukrainian minority in the Second Polish Republic.

== Government ==
From 22 to 25 November elections took place in Ukrainian-controlled territory for the 150-member Ukrainian National Council that was to serve as the legislative body. Yevhen Petrushevych, the chairman of the Council and a former member of the Austro-Hungarian parliament, automatically became the Republic&#x27;s president. Subordinated to him was the State Secretariat, whose members included Kost Levytsky (president of the secretariat and the Republic&#x27;s minister of finance), Dmytro Vitovsky (head of the armed forces), Lonhyn Tsehelsky (secretary of internal affairs), and Oleksander Barvinsky (secretary of education and religious affairs), among others. The country essentially had a two-party political system, dominated by the Ukrainian National Democrats and by its smaller rival, the Ukrainian Radical Party. The ruling National Democrats gave some of their seats to minor parties in order to ensure that the government represented a broad national coalition. In terms of the Ukrainian National Council&#x27;s social background, 57.1% of its members came from priestly families, 23.8% from peasant households, 4.8% from urban backgrounds, and 2.4% from the petty nobility. In terms of the identified council members&#x27; vocational background, approximately 30% were lawyers, 22% were teachers, 14% were farmers, 13% were priests, and 5% were civil servants. Approximately 28% had PhD&#x27;s, mostly in law.

The West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic governed an area with a population of approximately 4 million people for much of its nine-month existence. Lviv functioned as the Republic&#x27;s capital from 1 November until the loss of that city to Polish forces on 21 November, followed by Ternopil until late December 1918 and then by Stanyslaviv (present-day Ivano-Frankivsk) until 26 May 1919. Despite the war, the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic maintained the stability of the pre-war Austrian administration intact, employing Ukrainian and Polish professionals. The boundaries of counties and communities remained the same as they had been during the time of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The county, regional, and local courts continued to function as they had while the country had been a part of Austria, as did schools, the postal service, telegraphs and railroads. Austrian laws remained temporarily in force. Likewise, the government generally retained the Austrian system of tax collection, although war losses had impoverished the population and the amount of taxes collected was minimal. Most of the government&#x27;s revenue came from the export of oil and salt.

Of the 100 types of postage stamps issued by the republic, all but two were overprints of existing stamps produced by Austria, Austria-Hungary or Bosnia.

Although ethnic Poles represented only a small minority in the rural areas, they dominated the urban areas and almost 39% of eastern Galician lands had been in the hands of large Polish landowners prior to World War I. The Western Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic passed laws that confiscated vast manorial estates from private landlords and distributed this land to landless peasants. Other than in those limited cases, the right to private property was made fundamental and expropriation of lands was forbidden. This differentiated the policies of the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic from those of the socialistic Kyiv-based Ukrainian government.

The territory of the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic comprised 12 military districts, whose commanders were responsible for conscripting soldiers. The government was able to mobilize 100,000 soldiers in the spring of 1919, but due to a lack of military supplies, only 40,000 were battle-ready.

In general, the government of the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic was orderly and well-organized. This contrasted with the chaotic state of the Ukrainian governments that arose on the territory of the former Russian Empire.

===Policies towards national minorities and inter-ethnic relations===
Historian Yaroslav Hrytsak stated that the Ukrainian nationalism that developed before the First World War in Austria was anti-Polish, but neither &quot;very xenophobic&quot; nor antisemitic. In November 1918 a decision was made to include cabinet-level state secretaries of Polish, Jewish and German affairs. According to Hrytsak during the entire time of its existence there were no cases of mass repressions against national minorities in territories held by the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, Hrytsak states that this differentiated the Ukrainian government from that of Poland. Katarzyna Hibel writes that while officially West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic like Poland declared guarantees of rights of its national minorities, in reality, both countries were violating them and treated other foreign nationalities like fifth column. On 15 February 1919 a law was passed that made Ukrainian the state language. According to this law, however, members of national minorities had the right to communicate with the government in their own languages.

====Treatment of the Polish population====
Polish historian Rafał Galuba writes that Polish population was treated as second class citizens by West Ukrainian authorities. After 1 November, several members of Polish associations were arrested or interned by Ukrainian authorities; a similar fate awaited officials who refused to swear an oath of loyalty to Ukrainian state. On 6 November, a ban on Polish press and publications was issued in Lviv by Ukrainian authorities and printing presses demolished. (Poles had similarly banned Ukrainian publications in territories they controlled). Ukrainian authorities tried to intimidate Polish population in Lviv by sending soldiers and armed trucks into the streets and dispersed crowds that could turn to Polish demonstrations. Christoph Mick states that initially, the Ukrainian government refused to take Polish hostages but as both the Polish civilian and military resistance to Ukrainian forces grew, Polish civilians were threatened with summary executions by Ukrainian commander in chief for alleged attacks and shots on Ukrainian soldiers. In response, the Polish side proposed a peaceful solution of the conflict and joint Polish-Ukrainian militia to oversee the public safety in the city.

In Zolochiv, 17 Poles were executed by the Ukrainian authorities. In Briukhovychi, Polish railwaymen who refused to comply with Ukrainian orders to work were executed.

On 29 May 1919, the archbishop Józef Bilczewski sent a message to Ignacy Paderewski attending the Peace Conference in Paris, asking for help and alleging the brutal murders of Polish priests and civilians by the Ukrainians.

Many Poles didn&#x27;t support the Ukrainian authorities and set up an underground resistance movement that engaged in acts of sabotage. All fieldwork was stopped, the harvest destroyed and machinery purposely broken; Poles also issued to keep up the morale among the population. In response, Ukrainian authorities engaged in terror, including mass executions, court martial and set up detention centers where some Poles were interned. The conditions in these camps involved unheated wooden barracks, lack of bedding and lack of medical care, resulting in high levels of morbidity from typhoid. Estimated casualties at these camps include nearly 900 at a camp in Kosiv, according to various sources from 300 to 600 (dying from typhoid) in Mykulyntsi, 100 in Kolomyia, and 16 to 40 in Berezhany, due to unheated barracks at temperatures of −20 °C. Cases of robbing, beating, torturing or shooting of Polish prisoners were reported.

According to the historian Christopher Mick, the Ukrainian government in general treated the Polish population under its control no worse than the Polish government treated the Ukrainians under its control, writing that Ukrainian authorities didn&#x27;t treat the Polish population &quot;gently&quot; and that Ukrainian authorities mirrored Polish authorities by making speaking in Polish unwelcome. Mick acknowledges that Ukrainian side during the siege of Lviv stopped caring about supplies reaching the city and attempted to disrupt water supply to city. Its fierce artillery fire killed many civilians, including women and children.

In a report that he submitted to the Polish Foreign Ministry in early 1920, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Lviv Józef Bilczewski stated that the anti-Polish violence under Ukrainian governance was widespread and organised by the government, rather than being spontaneous. He headed a rescue committee that provided food to the poorest, and along with the Greek Catholic Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky he tried to negotiate a peace between the Polish and Ukrainian populace.

====Treatment of the Jewish minority====
Although relations between Poles and the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic were antagonistic, those between the Republic and its Jewish citizens was generally neutral or positive. Deep-seated rivalries existed between the Jewish and Polish communities, and anti-Semitism, particularly supported by the Polish National Democratic Party, became a feature of Polish national ideology. As a result, many Jews came to consider Polish independence as the least desirable option following the First World War. In contrast to the antagonistic position taken by Polish authorities towards Jews, the Ukrainian government actively supported Jewish cultural and political autonomy as a way of promoting its own legitimacy.

The Western Ukrainian government guaranteed Jewish cultural and national autonomy, provided Jewish communities with self-governing status, and promoted the formation of Jewish national councils which, with the approval of the Western Ukrainian government, established the Central Jewish National Council in December 1918 to represent Jewish interests in relation to the Ukrainian government and to the Western allies. The Council of Ministers of the West Ukrainian National Republic bought Yiddish-language textbooks and visual aids for Jewish schools and provided assistance to Jewish victims of the Polish pogrom in Lviv. The Ukrainian press maintained a friendly attitude towards the West Ukrainian Republic&#x27;s Jewish citizens. Their Hebrew and Yiddish schools, cultural institutions and publishers were allowed to function without interference.

Reflecting the republic&#x27;s demographics, approximately one-third of the seats in the national parliament were reserved for the national minorities (Poles, Jews, Slovaks and others). The Poles boycotted the elections, while the Jews, despite declaring their neutrality in the Polish-Ukrainian conflict, participated and were represented by approximately 10 percent of the delegates. Localized anti-Jewish assaults and robberies by Ukrainian peasants and soldiers, while far fewer in number and less brutal than similar actions by Poles, occurred between January and April 1919. The government publicly condemned such actions and intervened in defence of the Jewish community, imprisoning and even executing perpetrators of such crimes. The government also respected Jewish declared neutrality during the Polish-Ukrainian conflict. By the orders of Yevhen Petrushevych it was forbidden to mobilize Jews against their will or to otherwise force them to contribute to the Ukrainian military effort. In an effort to aid Western Ukraine&#x27;s economy, the Western Ukrainian government granted concessions to Jewish merchants.

The West Ukrainian government&#x27;s friendly attitude towards Jews was reciprocated by many members of the Jewish community. Although Jewish political organizations officially declared their neutrality in the Polish-Ukrainian struggle, many individual Jews offered their support or sympathized with the West Ukrainian government in its conflict with Poland. Jewish officers of the defunct Austro-Hungarian army joined the West Ukrainian military, and Jewish judges, lawyers, doctors and railroad employees joined the West Ukrainian civil service. From November 1918, ethnic Poles in the civil service who refused to pledge loyalty to the West Ukrainian government either quit &quot;en masse&quot; or were fired; their positions were filled by large numbers of Jews who were willing to support the Ukrainian state. Jews served as judges and legal consultants in the courts in Ternopil, Stanyslaviv, and Kolomyia. Jews were also able to create their own police units, and in some locations the Ukrainian government gave local Jewish militias responsibility for the maintenance of security and order. In the regions of Sambir and Radekhiv approximately a third of the police force was Jewish. Jews fielded their own battalion in the army of the Western Ukrainian National Republic, and Jewish youths worked as scouts for the West Ukrainian military. Most of the Jews cooperating with and serving in the West Ukrainian military were Zionists. In general, Jews made up the largest group of non-ethnic Ukrainians who participated in all branches of the West Ukrainian government.

The liberal attitude taken towards Jews by the Western Ukrainian government could be attributed to the Habsburg tradition of inter-ethnic tolerance and cooperation leaving its mark on the intelligentsia and military officers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The friendly attitude towards Jews that the Galician Ukrainians had was in stark contrast to the Directorate of Ukraine, which enjoyed no sympathy amongst the Jewish population.

== Economy ==
=== Currency ===
The republic did not have its own currency, but rather used the Austro-Hungarian crown. After the act of unification with the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, the banknotes in circulation were overprinted with nominals in the Ukrainian hryvnia.

Along with these official issues, some cities printed their local contingency banknotes (Notgeld) since 1914.

<text>In theoretical physics, mirror matter, also called shadow matter or alice matter, is a hypothetical counterpart to ordinary matter that mirrors the properties of ordinary matter but interacts with it only via gravity or weak interaction. 

==Overview==
Modern physics deals with three basic types of spatial symmetry: reflection, rotation, and translation. The known elementary particles respect rotational symmetry and translational symmetry but some do not respect mirror reflection symmetry (also called P-symmetry or parity). Of the four fundamental interactions—electromagnetism, the strong interaction, the weak interaction, and gravity—only the weak interaction breaks parity.

Parity violation in weak interactions was first postulated by Tsung Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang in 1956 as a solution to the puzzle. In consultation with the experimental physicist Chien-Shiung Wu a number of possibilities were proposed to test whether the weak interaction was in fact invariant under parity. One of the group&#x27;s suggestions involved monitoring the decay of Cobalt-60, formula_1to determine whether the electrons it emitted were radiated isotropically, like the two gamma rays. Wu performed this experiment at the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C. after nine months of work. Contrary to most expectations, in December 1956 she and her team observed anisotropic electron radiation, proving that the weak interactions of the known particles violate parity.

However, parity symmetry can be restored as a fundamental symmetry of nature if the particle content is enlarged so that every particle has a mirror partner. The theory in its modern form was described in 1991, although the basic idea dates back further. Mirror particles interact amongst themselves in the same way as ordinary particles, except where ordinary particles have left-handed interactions, mirror particles have right-handed interactions. In this way, it turns out that mirror reflection symmetry can exist as an exact symmetry of nature, provided that a &quot;mirror&quot; particle exists for every ordinary particle. Parity can also be spontaneously broken depending on the Higgs potential. While in the case of unbroken parity symmetry the masses of particles are the same as their mirror partners, in case of broken parity symmetry the mirror partners are lighter or heavier.

Mirror matter, if it exists, would interact weakly in strength with ordinary matter. This is because the forces between mirror particles are mediated by mirror bosons. With the exception of the graviton, none of the known bosons can be identical to their mirror partners. The only way mirror matter can interact with ordinary matter via forces other than gravity is via kinetic mixing of mirror bosons with ordinary bosons. These interactions can only be very weak. Mirror particles have therefore been suggested as candidates for the inferred dark matter in the universe.

In another context, mirror matter has been proposed to give rise to an effective Higgs mechanism responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking. In such a scenario, mirror fermions acquire masses on the order of 1 TeV since they interact with an additional gauge interaction not only becoming strong around the characteristic energy scale of the electroweak interactions but also being theoretically unified with Standard Model interactions under a larger gauge symmetry near the Planck energy scale. In order to emphasize the distinction of this model from the ones above, these mirror particles are usually called katoptrons within the context of the Katoptron model and they are expected to decay to Standard Model particles shortly after their creation.

==Observational effects==
===Abundance===
Mirror matter could have been diluted to unobservably low densities during the inflation epoch. Sheldon Glashow has shown that if at some high energy scale particles exist which interact strongly with both ordinary and mirror particles, radiative corrections will lead to a mixing between photons and mirror photons. This mixing has the effect of giving mirror electric charges a very small ordinary electric charge. Another effect of photon–mirror photon mixing is that it induces oscillations between positronium and mirror positronium. Positronium could then turn into mirror positronium and then decay into mirror photons.

The mixing between photons and mirror photons could be present in tree-level Feynman diagrams or arise as a consequence of quantum corrections due to the presence of particles that carry both ordinary and mirror charges. In the latter case, the quantum corrections have to vanish at the one and two loop-level Feynman diagrams, otherwise the predicted value of the kinetic mixing parameter would be larger than experimentally allowed.

An experiment to measure this effect was being planned in November 2003.

===Dark matter===
If mirror matter does exist in large abundances in the universe and if it interacts with ordinary matter via photon—mirror photon mixing, then this could be detected in dark matter direct detection experiments such as DAMA/NaI and its successor DAMA/LIBRA. In fact, it is one of the few dark matter candidates which can explain the positive DAMA/NaI dark matter signal whilst still being consistent with the null results of other dark matter experiments.

===Electromagnetic effects===
Mirror matter may also be detected in electromagnetic field penetration experiments and there would also be consequences for planetary science and astrophysics.

===GZK puzzle===
Mirror matter could also be responsible for the GZK puzzle. Topological defects in the mirror sector could produce mirror neutrinos which can oscillate to ordinary neutrinos. Another possible way to evade the GZK bound is via neutron–mirror neutron oscillations.

===Gravitational effects===
If mirror matter is present in the universe with sufficient abundance then its gravitational effects can be detected. Because mirror matter is analogous to ordinary matter, it is then to be expected that a fraction of the mirror matter exists in the form of mirror galaxies, mirror stars, mirror planets etc. These objects can be detected using gravitational microlensing. One would also expect that some fraction of stars have mirror objects as their companion. In such cases one should be able to detect periodic Doppler shifts in the spectrum of the star. There are some hints that such effects may already have been observed.

=== Neutron to mirror-neutron oscillations ===
Neutrons which are electrically neutral particles of ordinary matter could oscillate into its mirror partner, the mirror neutron. Recent experiments looked for neutrons vanishing into the mirror world. Most experiments found no signal and hence gave limits on transition rates to the mirror state, one paper claimed signals. Current research looks for signals where an applied magnetic field adjust the energy level of the neutron to the mirror world. This energy difference can be interpreted due to a mirror magnetic field present in the mirror world or a mass difference of the neutron and its mirror partner. Such a transition to the mirror world could also solve the neutron lifetime puzzle.

Experiments searching for mirror neutron oscillation are ongoing at the Paul Scherrer Institute&#x27;s UCN source in Switzerland, Institut Laue-Langevin in France, and via the Spallation Neutron Source at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the U.S.

<doc id="539355" wikidata="Q3779582" url="?curid=539355" title="Microbiologist">
<text>A microbiologist (from Greek ) is a scientist who studies microscopic life forms and processes. This includes study of the growth, interactions and characteristics of microscopic organisms such as bacteria, algae, fungi, and some types of parasites and their vectors. Most microbiologists work in offices and/or research facilities, both in private biotechnology companies and in academia. Most microbiologists specialize in a given topic within microbiology such as bacteriology, parasitology, virology, or immunology.

== Duties ==
Microbiologists generally work in some way to increase scientific knowledge or to utilise that knowledge in a way that improves outcomes in medicine or some industry. For many microbiologists, this work includes planning and conducting experimental research projects in some kind of laboratory setting. Others may have a more administrative role, supervising scientists and evaluating their results. Microbiologists working in the medical field, such as clinical microbiologists, may see patients or patient samples and do various tests to detect disease-causing organisms.

For microbiologists working in academia, duties include performing research in an academic laboratory, writing grant proposals to fund research, as well as some amount of teaching and designing courses. Microbiologists in industry roles may have similar duties except research is performed in industrial labs in order to develop or improve commercial products and processes. Industry jobs may also not include some degree of sales and marketing work, as well as regulatory compliance duties. Microbiologists working in government may have a variety of duties, including laboratory research, writing and advising, developing and reviewing regulatory processes, and overseeing grants offered to outside institutions. Some microbiologists work in the field of patent law, either with national patent offices or private law practices. Her duties include research and navigation of intellectual property regulations. Clinical microbiologists tend to work in government or hospital laboratories where their duties include analyzing clinical specimens to detect microorganisms responsible for the disease. Some microbiologists instead work in the field of science outreach, where they develop programs and materials to educate students and non-scientists and encourage interest in the field of microbiology for the younger generation

== Education ==
Entry-level microbiology jobs generally require at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree in microbiology or a related field. These degree programs frequently include courses in chemistry, physics, statistics, biochemistry, and genetics, followed by more specialized courses in sub-fields of interest. Many of these courses have laboratory components to teach trainees basic and specialized laboratory skills.

Higher-level and independent jobs like a clinical/Medical Microbiologist in a hospital or medical research centre generally require a Masters in Microbiology along with PhD in any of the life-sciences (Biochem, Micro, Biotech, Genetics, etc) as well as several years experience as a microbiologist. This often includes time spent as a postdoctoral researcher wherein one leads research projects and prepares to transition to an independent career. Postdoctoral researchers are often evaluated largely based on their record of published academic papers, as well as recommendations from their supervisors and colleagues.

In certain sub-fields of microbiology, licenses or certifications are available or required in order to qualify for certain positions. This is true for clinical microbiologists, as well as those involved in food safety and some aspects of pharmaceutical/medical device development.

== Job outlook ==
Microbiologists are expected to be needed to help pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies develop new drugs that are produced with the aid of microorganisms. In addition, demand for biofuels production is expected to increase the need for microbiologists to conduct advanced research and development in these areas.

In the United States, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that employment of microbiologists will grow 5 percent from 2022 (20,900 employed) to 2032 (22,000 employed). This represents slower growth than the average occupation, as well as slower growth than life scientists as a whole (7 percent projected).

<text>Lynda Susan Weinman (born January 24, 1955) is an artist, American business owner, computer instructor, and author, who founded an online software training website, lynda.com, with her husband, Bruce Heavin. Lynda.com was acquired by online business network LinkedIn in April 2015 for $1.5 billion (~$ in ).

Weinman, with self-taught computer skills, worked in the film industry as a special effects animator, and became a faculty member at ArtCenter College of Design, UCLA, American Film Institute, and San Francisco State University multimedia studies program teaching computer graphics, animation, interactive design, and motion graphics. She has also written several books.

==Education==
Weinman graduated with a degree in humanities from The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington in 1976. In 2015, Weinman received an honorary doctorate from Otis College of Art and Design.

==Career==
A year after graduating, Weinman opened two retail stores, &quot;Vertigo on Melrose&quot; and &quot;Vertigo on Sunset&quot; in Los Angeles. They closed in 1982.

Weinman worked for Dreamquest and as an independent contractor doing animation and special effects. She worked on several films, including &quot;RoboCop 2&quot; (1990), &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot; (1989), and &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot; (1989).

Weinman attributes her initial interest in computers to her having taught herself how to use an Apple II. She acquired these skills by reading the manual.

Weinman taught digital media and motion graphics at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California from 1989 to 1996. Her book &quot;designing web graphics&quot;, published by New Riders in 1995, often is credited with being the first title to discuss web authoring technologies from a visual design perspective.

Weinman was co-founder with her husband, Bruce Heavin, of the Ojai Digital Arts Center in Ojai, California in 1999.

In March 2020, Weinman founded the site claybottress.com to detail her interest in and studies of 3D clay printing. She has had gallery and museum exhibits of the sculptures, vases, handbags, and jewelry she has designed and created with 3d printing technologies.

Weinman co-founded Clay Studio SB (now Maker House) in Goleta, California in 2020 with ceramicist Patrick J. Hall.

==Lynda.com==

The Lynda.com Online Training Library taught computer skills in video format to members through monthly and annual subscription-based plans. The company was founded in Ojai, California and has since moved to Ventura and Carpinteria, California, where, as of 2013, it employed nearly 500 full-time staff members and more than 140 teachers who earn royalties from their shared revenue model. The company website was created in 1995 and the company was incorporated in 1997.

Lynda.com evolved from its original conception as a free web resource for Lynda&#x27;s students, to the site for her books on web design, to the registration hub for physical classrooms and conferences, to an online virtual knowledge library, where members could watch software and technology courses in several categories (3D and animation, audio, business, design, development, home computing, photography, video, and web and interactive design). The company also produced documentaries about creative professionals.

The company received $103 million (~$ in ) in venture capital funding in January 2013, led by Accel Partners and Spectrum Equity. In April 2013, lynda.com layed off 45 of its 460 employees in order to &quot;eliminate corporate operations redundancy.&quot; On January 14, 2015, lynda.com announced it had raised $186 million (~$ in ) in financing, led by investment group TPG Capital.

In 2013, Lynda.com acquired video2brain, an Austrian-based provider of online classes in web design and programming, available in German, French, Spanish, and English languages.

In 2014, it acquired Compilr, provider of an online editor and sandbox.

On April 7, 2015, LinkedIn acquired Lynda.com in a deal worth $1.5 billion (~$ in ). The sale was immediately followed by a 10% cut in company staff. During the next half year, layoffs continued as Lynda.com departments were folded into LinkedIn.

==Flashforward conferences==
Lynda.com and United Digital Artists Productions, Inc. (UAD) co-founded the Flashforward Conferences and the Flash Film Festival, which first took place in 1999. The Flashforward Conference, the first event focused on Macromedia Flash, held fourteen events in San Francisco, New York, London, and Amsterdam, serving more than 20,000 attendees over six years. The Flash Film Festival presented more than 200 awards to Flash sites and applications, to winners from more than 30 countries. The last scheduled conference took place in August 2008.

<text>Carlos Castillo Armas (; 4 November 191426 July 1957) was a Guatemalan military officer and politician who was the 28th president of Guatemala, serving from 1954 to 1957 after taking power in a coup d&#x27;état. A member of the far-right National Liberation Movement (MLN) party, his authoritarian government was closely allied with the United States.

Born to a planter, out of wedlock, Castillo Armas was educated at Guatemala&#x27;s military academy. A protégé of Colonel Francisco Javier Arana, he joined Arana&#x27;s forces during the 1944 uprising against President Federico Ponce Vaides. This began the Guatemalan Revolution and the introduction of representative democracy to the country. Castillo Armas joined the General Staff and became director of the military academy. Arana and Castillo Armas opposed the newly elected government of Juan José Arévalo; after Arana&#x27;s failed 1949 coup, Castillo Armas went into exile in Honduras. Seeking support for another revolt, he came to the attention of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). In 1950 he launched a failed assault on Guatemala City, before escaping back to Honduras. Influenced by lobbying by the United Fruit Company and Cold War fears of communism, in 1952 the US government of President Harry Truman authorized Operation PBFortune, a plot to overthrow Arévalo&#x27;s successor, President Jacobo Árbenz. Castillo Armas was to lead the coup, but the plan was abandoned before being revived in a new form by US President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953.

In June 1954, Castillo Armas led 480 CIA-trained soldiers into Guatemala, backed by US-supplied aircraft. Despite initial setbacks to the rebel forces, US support for the rebels made the Guatemalan army reluctant to fight, and Árbenz resigned on 27 June. A series of military juntas briefly held power during negotiations that ended with Castillo Armas assuming the presidency on 7 July. Castillo Armas consolidated his power in an October 1954 election, in which he was the only candidate; the MLN, which he led, was the only party allowed to contest the congressional elections. Árbenz&#x27;s popular agricultural reform was largely rolled back, with land confiscated from small farmers and returned to large landowners. Castillo Armas cracked down on unions and peasant organizations, arresting and killing thousands. He created a National Committee of Defense Against Communism, which investigated over 70,000 people and added 10 percent of the population to a list of suspected communists.

Despite these efforts, Castillo Armas faced significant internal resistance, which was blamed on communist agitation. The government, plagued by corruption and soaring debt, became dependent on aid from the US. In 1957 Castillo Armas was assassinated by a presidential guard with leftist sympathies. He was the first of a series of authoritarian rulers in Guatemala who were close allies of the US. His reversal of the reforms of his predecessors sparked a series of leftist insurgencies in the country after his death, culminating in the Guatemalan Civil War of 1960 to 1996.

==Early life and career==

Carlos Castillo Armas was born on 4 November 1914, in Santa Lucía Cotzumalguapa in the department of Escuintla. He was the son of a landowner, but was born out of wedlock, making him ineligible to inherit the property. In 1936 he graduated from the Guatemalan military academy. His time at the academy overlapped with that of Jacobo Árbenz, who would later become President of Guatemala.

In June 1944, a series of popular protests forced the resignation of dictator Jorge Ubico. Ubico&#x27;s successor Federico Ponce Vaides pledged to hold free elections, but continued to suppress dissent, leading progressives in the army to plot a coup against him. The plot was initially led by Árbenz and Aldana Sandoval; Sandoval persuaded Francisco Javier Arana, the influential commander of the &quot;Guardia de Honor&quot;, to join the coup in its final stages. On 19 October, Arana and Árbenz launched a coup against Ponce Vaides&#x27; government. In the election that followed, Juan José Arévalo was elected president. Castillo Armas was a strong supporter and protégé of Arana, and thus joined the rebels. Speaking of Castillo Armas, Árbenz would later say that he was &quot;modest, brave, sincere&quot; and that he had fought with &quot;great bravery&quot; during the coup.
For seven months, between October 1945 and April 1946, Castillo Armas received training at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he came in contact with American intelligence officers. After serving on the General Staff, he became director of the military academy until early 1949, at which point he was made the military commander at Mazatenango, Suchitepéquez, a remote military garrison. Castillo Armas had eventually risen to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He was at Mazatenango when Arana launched his failed coup attempt against Arévalo on 18 July 1949, and was killed: Castillo Armas did not hear of the revolt until four days later. Historians differ on what happened to him at this point. Historian Piero Gleijeses writes that Castillo Armas was expelled from the country following the coup attempt against Arévalo. Nick Cullather and Andrew Fraser state that Castillo Armas was arrested in August 1949, that Árbenz had him imprisoned under doubtful charges until December 1949, and that he was found in Honduras a month later.

==Operation PBFortune and CIA ties==

Following the end of Arévalo&#x27;s highly popular presidency in 1951, Árbenz was elected president. He continued the reforms of Arévalo and also began an ambitious land reform program known as Decree 900. Under it, the uncultivated portions of large land-holdings were expropriated in return for compensation and redistributed to poverty-stricken agricultural laborers. The agrarian reform law angered the United Fruit Company, which at the time dominated the Guatemalan economy. Benefiting from decades of support from the US government, by 1930 the company was already the largest landowner and employer in Guatemala. It was granted further favors by Ubico, including of public land, and an exemption from all taxes.

Feeling threatened by Árbenz&#x27;s reforms, the company responded with an intensive lobbying campaign directed at members of the United States government. The Cold War had also predisposed the administration of US President Harry Truman to see the Guatemalan government as communist. The US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) started to explore the notion of lending support to detractors and opponents of Árbenz. Walter Bedell Smith, the Director of Central Intelligence, ordered J. C. King, the chief of the Western Hemisphere Division, to examine whether dissident Guatemalans could topple the Árbenz government if they had support from the authoritarian governments in Central America.

Castillo Armas had encountered the CIA in January 1950, when a CIA officer learned he was attempting to get weapons from Anastasio Somoza García and Rafael Trujillo, the right-wing authoritarian rulers of Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic, respectively. The CIA officer had described him as &quot;a quiet, soft-spoken officer who [did] not seem to be given to exaggeration&quot;. Castillo Armas met with the CIA a few more times before November 1950. Speaking to the CIA, he had stated that he had the support of the &quot;Guardia Civil&quot; (the Civil Guard), the army garrison at Quezaltenango, as well as the commander of Matamoros, the largest fortress in Guatemala City.

A few days after his last meeting with the CIA, Castillo Armas had led an assault against Matamoros along with a handful of supporters. The attack failed, and Castillo Armas was wounded and arrested. A year later, he bribed his way out of prison, and escaped back to Honduras. Castillo Armas&#x27;s stories of his revolt and escape from prison proved popular among the right-wing exiles in Honduras. Among these people, Castillo Armas claimed to still have support among the army, and began planning another revolt. His reputation was inflated by stories that he had escaped from prison through a tunnel.

The engineer dispatched by the CIA to liaise with Castillo Armas informed the CIA that Castillo Armas had the financial backing of Somoza and Trujillo. Truman thereupon authorized Operation PBFortune. When contacted by the CIA agent dispatched by Smith, Castillo Armas proposed a battle-plan to gain CIA support. This plan involved three forces invading Guatemala from Mexico, Honduras, and ElSalvador. These invasions were supposed to be supported by internal rebellions. King formulated a plan to provide Castillo Armas with $225,000 as well as weaponry and transportation. Somoza was involved in the scheme; the CIA also contacted Trujillo, and Marcos Pérez Jiménez, the US-supported right-wing dictator of Venezuela, who were both supportive, and agreed to contribute some funding. However, the coup attempt was terminated by Dean Acheson, the US Secretary of State, before it could be completed. Accounts of the final termination of the coup attempt vary: some argue that it was due to the US State Department discovering the coup, while others say that it was due to Somoza spreading information about the CIA&#x27;s role in it, leading to the coup&#x27;s cover being blown.

Castillo Armas&#x27;s services were retained by the CIA, who paid him $3,000 a week, which allowed him to maintain a small force. The CIA remained in contact with him, and continued to provide support to the rebels. The money paid to Castillo Armas has been described as a way of making sure that he did not attempt any premature action. Even after the operation had been terminated, the CIA received reports from a Spanish-speaking agent operating under the code name &quot;Seekford&quot; that the Guatemalan rebels were planning assassinations. Castillo Armas made plans to use groups of soldiers in civilian clothing from Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador to kill political and military leaders in Guatemala.

==Coup d&#x27;état==

===Planning===

In November 1952 Dwight Eisenhower was elected president of the US, promising to take a harder line against communism. Senior figures in his administration, including Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and his brother and CIA director Allen Dulles, had close ties to the United Fruit Company, making Eisenhower more strongly predisposed than Truman to support Árbenz&#x27;s overthrow. These factors culminated in the Eisenhower administration&#x27;s decision to authorize &quot;Operation PBSuccess&quot; to overthrow the Guatemalan government in August 1953.

The operation had a budget of between five and seven million dollars. It involved a number of CIA agents, and widespread local recruiting. The plans included drawing up lists of people within Árbenz&#x27;s government to be assassinated if the coup were to be carried out. A team of diplomats who would support PBSuccess was created; the leader of this team was John Peurifoy, who took over as the US ambassador in Guatemala in October 1953.

The CIA considered several candidates to lead the coup. Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes, the conservative candidate who had lost the 1950 election to Árbenz, held favor with the opposition but was rejected for his role in the Ubico regime, as well as his European appearance, which was unlikely to appeal to the majority mixed-race &quot;Ladinos&quot;, or &quot;mestizo&quot; population. Castillo Armas, in contrast, is described by historian Nick Cullather as a &quot;physically unimposing man with marked &quot;mestizo&quot; features&quot;. Another front-runner was coffee planter Juan Córdova Cerna, who had briefly served in Arévalo&#x27;s cabinet. The death of his son in an anti-government uprising in 1950 had turned him against the administration. Although his status as a civilian gave him an advantage over Castillo Armas, he was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1954, taking him out of the reckoning.

This led to the selection of Castillo Armas, the former lieutenant of Arana, who had been in exile following the failed coup in 1949. Castillo Armas had remained on the CIA payroll since the aborted Operation PBFortune in 1951. Historians have also stated that Castillo Armas was ultimately seen as the most dependable leader from the CIA&#x27;s perspective. He also had the advantage of having had a clerical education during his exile, and therefore the support of Guatemala&#x27;s archbishop. In CIA documents, he was referred to by the codename &quot;Calligeris.&quot;

Castillo Armas was given enough money to recruit a small force of approximately 150 mercenaries from among Guatemalan exiles and the populations of nearby countries. This band was called the &quot;Army of Liberation&quot;. The CIA established training camps in Nicaragua and Honduras, and supplied them with weapons as well as several planes flown by American pilots. Prior to the invasion of Guatemala, the US signed military agreements with both of those countries, allowing it to move heavier arms freely. These preparations were only superficially covert: the CIA intended Árbenz to find out about them, as a part of its plan to convince the Guatemalan people that the overthrow of Árbenz was inevitable.

Castillo Armas&#x27;s army was not large enough to defeat the Guatemalan military, even with US-supplied planes. Therefore, the plans for Operation PBSuccess called for a campaign of psychological warfare, which would present Castillo Armas&#x27;s victory as a &quot;fait accompli&quot; to the Guatemalan people, and would force Árbenz to resign. The US propaganda campaign began well before the invasion, with the United States Information Agency writing hundreds of articles on Guatemala based on CIA reports, and distributing tens of thousands of leaflets throughout Latin America. The CIA persuaded the governments that were friendly to it to screen video footage of Guatemala that supported the US version of events. The most wide-reaching psychological weapon was the radio station known as the &quot;Voice of Liberation&quot;. This station began broadcasting on 1 May 1954, carrying anti-communist messages and telling its listeners to resist the Árbenz government and support the liberating forces of Castillo Armas. The station claimed to be broadcasting from deep within the jungles of the Guatemalan hinterland, a message that many listeners believed. In actuality, the broadcasts were concocted in Miami by Guatemalan exiles, flown to Central America, and broadcast through a mobile transmitter.

===Invasion===

Castillo Armas&#x27;s force of 480 men was split into four teams, ranging in size from 60 to 198. On 15 June 1954, these four forces left their bases in Honduras and El Salvador and assembled in various towns just outside the Guatemalan border. The largest force was supposed to attack the Atlantic harbor town of Puerto Barrios, while the others were to attack the smaller towns of Esquipulas, Jutiapa, and Zacapa, the Guatemalan Army&#x27;s largest frontier post. The invasion plan quickly faced difficulties; the 60-man force was intercepted and jailed by Salvadoran policemen before it got to the border. At 8:20am on 18 June 1954, Castillo Armas led his invading troops over the border. Ten trained saboteurs preceded the invasion, with the aim of blowing up railways and cutting telegraph lines. At about the same time, Castillo Armas&#x27;s planes flew over a pro-government rally in the capital. Castillo Armas demanded Árbenz&#x27;s immediate surrender. The invasion provoked a brief panic in the capital, which quickly decreased as the rebels failed to make any significant headway. Travelling on foot and weighed down by weapons and supplies, Castillo Armas&#x27;s forces took several days to reach their targets, although their planes blew up a bridge on 19 June.

When the rebels did reach their targets, they experienced further setbacks. The force of 122 men targeting Zacapa was intercepted and decisively beaten by a small garrison of 30 loyalist soldiers, with only 30 rebels escaping death or capture. The force that attacked Puerto Barrios was defeated by policemen and armed dockworkers, with many of the rebels fleeing back to Honduras. In an effort to regain momentum, the rebels attacked the capital with their planes. These attacks caused little material damage, but they had a significant psychological impact, leading many citizens to believe that the invasion force was more powerful than it actually was. The CIA also continued to transmit propaganda from the supposed &quot;Voice of Liberation&quot; station throughout the conflict, broadcasting news of rebel troops converging on the capital, and contributing to massive demoralization among both the army and the civilian population.

===Aftermath===

Árbenz was initially confident that his army would quickly dispatch the rebel force. The victory of the small Zacapa garrison strengthened his belief. However, the CIA&#x27;s psychological warfare made the army unwilling to fight Castillo Armas. Gleijeses stated that if it were not for US support for the rebellion, the officer corps of the Guatemalan army would have remained loyal to Árbenz because although not uniformly his supporters, they were more wary of Castillo Armas; they had strong nationalist views, and were opposed to foreign interference. As it was, they believed that the US would intervene militarily, leading to a battle they could not win. On 17 June, the army leaders at Zacapa had begun to negotiate with Castillo Armas. They signed a pact, known as the &quot;Pacto de Las Tunas&quot;, three days later, which placed the army at Zacapa under Castillo Armas in return for a general amnesty. The army returned to its barracks a few days later, &quot;despondent, with a terrible sense of defeat&quot;, according to Gleijeses.

Árbenz decided to arm the civilian population to defend the capital; this plan failed, as an insufficient number of people volunteered. At this point, Colonel Carlos Enrique Díaz de León, the chief of staff of the Guatemalan army, reneged on his support for the president and began plotting to overthrow Árbenz with the assistance of other senior army officers. They informed Peurifoy of this plan, asking him to stop the hostilities in return for Árbenz&#x27;s resignation. On 27 June 1954, Árbenz met with Díaz, and informed him that he was resigning. Historian Hugo Jiménez wrote that Castillo Armas&#x27;s invasion did not pose a significant direct threat to Árbenz; rather, the coup led by Diaz and the Guatemalan army was the critical factor in his overthrow.

Árbenz left office at 8pm, after recording a resignation speech that was broadcast on the radio an hour later. Immediately afterward, Díaz announced that he would be taking over the presidency in the name of the Guatemalan Revolution, and stated that the Guatemalan army would still fight against Castillo Armas&#x27;s invasion. Peurifoy had not expected Díaz to keep fighting. A couple of days later, Peurifoy informed Díaz that he would have to resign; according to the CIA officer who spoke to Díaz, this was because he was &quot;not convenient for American foreign policy&quot;. At first, Díaz attempted to placate Peurifoy by forming a junta with Colonel Elfego Monzón and Colonel José Angel Sánchez, and led by himself. Peurifoy continued to insist that he resign, until Díaz was overthrown by a rapid bloodless coup led by Monzón, who, according to Gleijeses, was more pliable. The other members of Monzón&#x27;s junta were José Luis Cruz Salazar and Mauricio Dubois.

Initially, Monzón was not willing to hand over power to Castillo Armas. The US State Department persuaded Óscar Osorio, the president of ElSalvador, to invite Monzón, Castillo Armas, and other significant individuals to participate in peace talks in San Salvador. Osorio agreed to do so, and after Díaz had been deposed, Monzón and Castillo Armas arrived in the Salvadoran capital on 30 June. Castillo Armas wished to incorporate some of his rebel forces into the Guatemalan military; Monzón, was reluctant to allow this, leading to difficulties in the negotiations. Castillo Armas also saw Monzón as having been late to enter the fight against Árbenz. The negotiations nearly broke down on this issue on the very first day, and so Peurifoy, who had remained in Guatemala City to give the impression that the US was not heavily involved, traveled to San Salvador. Allen Dulles later said that Peurifoy&#x27;s role was to &quot;crack some heads together&quot;.

Peurifoy was able to force an agreement due to the fact that neither Monzón nor Castillo Armas was in a position to become or remain president without the support of the US. The deal was announced at 4:45am on 2 July 1954, and under its terms, Castillo Armas and his subordinate, Major Enrique Trinidad Oliva, became members of the junta led by Monzón, although Monzón remained president. The settlement negotiated by Castillo Armas and Monzón also included a statement that the five-man junta would rule for fifteen days, during which a president would be chosen. Colonels Dubois and Cruz Salazar, Monzón&#x27;s supporters on the junta, had signed a secret agreement without Monzón&#x27;s knowledge. On 7 July they resigned in keeping with the terms of the agreement. Monzón, left outnumbered on the junta, also resigned, and on 8 July, Castillo Armas was unanimously elected president of the junta. Dubois and Salazar were each paid US$100,000 for cooperating with Castillo Armas. The US promptly recognized the new government on 13 July.

==Presidency and assassination==
===Election===

Soon after taking power, Castillo Armas faced a coup from young army cadets, who were unhappy with the army&#x27;s capitulation. The coup was put down, leaving 29 dead and 91 wounded. Elections were held in early October from which all political parties were barred from participating. Castillo Armas was the only candidate; he won the election with 99 percent of the vote, completing his transition into power. Castillo Armas became affiliated with a party named the Movimiento de Liberación Nacional (MLN), which remained the ruling party of Guatemala from 1954 to 1957. It was led by Mario Sandoval Alarcón, and was a coalition of municipal politicians, bureaucrats, coffee planters, and members of the military, all of whom were opposed to the reforms of the Guatemalan Revolution. In the congressional elections held under Castillo Armas in late 1955, it was the only party allowed to run.

===Authoritarian rule===

Prior to the 1954 coup, Castillo Armas had been reluctant to discuss how he would govern the country. He had never articulated any particular philosophy, which had worried his CIA contacts. The closest he came to doing so was the &quot;Plan de Tegucigalpa&quot;, a manifesto issued on 23 December 1953, that criticized the &quot;Sovietization of Guatemala&quot;. Castillo Armas had expressed sympathy for &quot;justicialismo&quot;, the philosophy supported by Juan Perón, the President of Argentina.

Upon taking power Castillo Armas, worried that he lacked popular support, attempted to eliminate all opposition. He quickly arrested many thousands of opposition leaders, branding them communists. Detention camps were built to hold the prisoners when the jails exceeded their capacity. Historians have estimated that more than 3,000 people were arrested following the coup, and that approximately 1,000 agricultural workers were killed by Castillo Armas&#x27;s troops on Finca Jocatán alone, near Tiquisate, which had been a major center of labour organising throughout the decade of the revolution. Acting on the advice of Dulles, Castillo Armas also detained a number of citizens trying to flee the country. He also created a National Committee of Defense Against Communism (CDNCC), with sweeping powers of arrest, detention, and deportation. Over the next few years, the committee investigated nearly 70,000 people. Many were imprisoned, executed, or &quot;disappeared&quot;, frequently without trial.

In August 1954, the government passed Decree59, which permitted the security forces to detain anybody on the blacklist of the CDNCC for six months without trial. The eventual list of suspected communists compiled by the CDNCC included one in every ten adults in the country. Attempts were also made to eliminate from government positions people who had gained them under Árbenz. All political parties, labor unions, and peasant organizations were outlawed. In histories of the period, Castillo Armas has been referred to as a dictator.

Castillo Armas&#x27;s junta drew support from individuals in Guatemala that had previously supported Ubico. José Bernabé Linares, the deeply unpopular head of Ubico&#x27;s secret police, was named the new head of the security forces. Linares had a reputation for using electric-shock baths and steel skull-caps to torture prisoners. Castillo Armas also removed the right to vote from all illiterate people, who constituted two-thirds of the country&#x27;s population, and annulled the 1945 constitution, giving himself virtually unbridled power. His government launched a concerted campaign against trade unionists, in which some of the most severe violence was directed at workers on the plantations of the United Fruit Company. In 1956 Castillo Armas implemented a new constitution and had himself declared president for four years. His presidency faced opposition from the beginning: agricultural laborers continued to fight Castillo Armas&#x27;s forces until August 1954, and there were numerous uprisings against him, especially in the areas that had experienced significant agricultural reform.

Opposition to his government grew during Castillo Armas&#x27;s presidency. On Labor Day in 1956, members of the government were booed off a stage at a labor rally, while officials who had previously been in the Árbenz administration were cheered. The Guatemalan Communist Party began to recover underground, and became prominent in the opposition. Overall, the government had to deal with four serious rebellions, in addition to the coup attempt by the cadets in 1954. On 25 June 1956, government forces opened fire on student protesters, killing six people and wounding a large number. Castillo Armas responded by declaring a &quot;state of siege&quot;, and revoked all civil liberties. On the advice of the US ambassador, the protests were portrayed as a communist plot.

===Decree 900 reversal===

Castillo Armas&#x27;s government also attempted to reverse the agrarian reform project initiated by Árbenz, and large areas of land were seized from the agrarian laborers who had received them under Árbenz and given to large landowners. In only a few isolated instances were peasants able to retain their lands. Castillo Armas&#x27;s reversal of Árbenz&#x27;s agrarian reforms led the US embassy to comment that it was a &quot;long step backwards&quot; from the previous policy. Thousands of peasants who attempted to remain on the lands they had received from Árbenz were arrested by the Guatemalan police. Some peasants were arrested under the pretext that they were communists, though very few of them were. Few of these arrested peasants were ever convicted, but landlords used the arrests to evict peasants from their land. The government under Castillo Armas issued two ordinances related to agricultural policy. In theory, these decrees promised to protect the grants of land made by the Árbenz government under Decree900. The decrees also allowed landowners to petition for the return of land seized &quot;illegally&quot;. However, the repressive atmosphere at the time in which the decrees were passed meant that very few peasants could take advantage of them. In total, of the 529,939 &quot;manzanas&quot; of land expropriated under Decree900, 368,481 were taken from peasants and returned to landowners. Ultimately, Castillo Armas did not go as far towards restoring the power and privileges of his upper-class and business constituency as they would have liked. A &quot;liberation tax&quot; that he imposed was not popular among the wealthy.

===Economic issues===

Castillo Armas&#x27;s dependence on the officer corps and the mercenaries who had put him in power led to widespread corruption, and the USgovernment was soon subsidizing the Guatemalan government with many millions of dollars. Guatemala quickly came to depend completely on financial support from the Eisenhower administration. Castillo Armas proved unable to attract sufficient business investment, and in September 1954 asked the US for $260million in aid. Castillo Armas also directed his government to provide support to the CIA operation &quot;PBHistory&quot;, an unsuccessful effort to use documents captured after the 1954 coup to sway international opinion in its favor. Despite examining many hundreds of thousands of documents, this operation failed to find any evidence that the Soviet Union was controlling communists within Guatemala. Castillo also found himself too dependent on a coalition of economic interests, including the cotton and sugar industries in Guatemala and real estate, timber, and oil interests in the US, to be able to seriously pursue reforms that he had promised, such as free trade with the US.

By April 1955 the government&#x27;s foreign exchange reserves had declined from US$42million at the end of 1954 to just $3.4million. The regime was thus facing difficulties borrowing money, leading to capital flight. The government also received criticism for the presence of black markets and other signs of approaching bankruptcy. By the end of 1954 the number of unemployed people in the country had risen to 20,000, four times higher than it had been during the latter years of the Árbenz government. In April 1955 the Eisenhower administration approved an aid package of $53million and began to underwrite the debt of the Guatemalan government. Although officials in the USgovernment complained about Castillo Armas&#x27;s incompetence and corruption, he also received praise in that country for acting against communists, and his human rights violations generally went unremarked. In 1955, during a corn famine, Castillo Armas gave corn import licenses to some of his old fighters in return for a $25,000 bribe. The imported corn, upon inspection by the United Nations, turned out to be unfit for consumption. When a student newspaper exposed the story, Castillo Armas launched a police crackdown against those criticizing him. Castillo Armas returned some of the privileges that the United Fruit Company had had under Ubico, but the company did not benefit substantially from them; it went into a gradual decline following disastrous experiments with breeding and pesticides, falling demand, and an anti-trust action.

===Murder and legacy===
On 26 July 1957, Castillo Armas was shot dead by a leftist in the presidential palace in Guatemala City. The assassin, Romeo Vásquez Sánchez, was a member of the presidential guard; he approached Castillo Armas as he was walking with his wife and shot him twice. Castillo Armas died instantly; Vásquez was reported to have fled to a different room and committed suicide. There is no conclusive information about whether Vásquez was acting alone or whether he was a part of a larger conspiracy. Elections were held following Castillo Armas&#x27;s death in which the government-aligned Miguel Ortiz Passarelli won a majority. However, supporters of Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes, who had also been a candidate in the election, rioted, after which the army seized power and annulled the result, and another election was held. Ydígoras Fuentes won this election by a comfortable margin, and soon afterward declared a &quot;state of siege&quot; and seized complete control over the government.

Historian Nick Cullather wrote that by overthrowing Árbenz, the CIA ended up undermining its own initial goal of a stable Guatemalan government. Historian Stephen Streeter stated that while the US achieved certain strategic goals by installing the &quot;malleable&quot; Castillo Armas as president, it did so at the cost of Guatemala&#x27;s democratic institutions. He further states that, although Castillo Armas probably would have committed the human rights violations that he did even without a US presence, the US State Department had certainly aided and abetted the process. The rolling back of the progressive policies of the previous civilian governments resulted in a series of leftist insurgencies in the countryside beginning in 1960. This triggered the Guatemalan Civil War between the US-backed military government of Guatemala and leftist insurgents, who often boasted a sizable following among the citizenry. The conflict, which lasted between 1960 and 1996, resulted in the deaths of 200,000 civilians. Though crimes against civilians were committed by both sides, 93 percent of such atrocities were committed by the US-backed military. These violations included a genocidal scorched-earth campaign against the indigenous Maya population during the 1980s. Historians have attributed the violence of the civil war to the 1954 coup, and the &quot;anti-communist paranoia&quot; that it generated.

<text>An election to the [[London Assembly|Assembly]] of [[London]] took place on 10 June 2004, along with the 2004 London mayoral election.

The Assembly is elected by the Additional Member System. There are fourteen directly elected constituencies, nine of which were won by the Conservatives and five by the Labour Party. An additional eleven members were allocated by a London wide top-up vote, with the proviso that parties must win at least 5% of the vote to qualify for list seats. This latter rule prevented both the British National Party and the Respect Party from winning a seat each as both fell just short of the 5% threshold.

This election saw losses for Labour and the Greens and gains for both the Liberal Democrats and UKIP, who achieved their first representation in the Assembly since its creation in 2000.

<text>Animal Man (Bernhard &quot;Buddy&quot; Baker) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. As a result of being in proximity to an exploding extraterrestrial spaceship, Buddy Baker acquires the ability to temporarily &quot;borrow&quot; the abilities of animals (such as a bird&#x27;s flight or the proportionate strength of an ant). Using these powers, Baker fights crime as the costumed superhero Animal Man.

Created by writer Dave Wood and artist Carmine Infantino, Buddy Baker first appeared in &quot;Strange Adventures&quot; #180 (September 1965) and adopted the name Animal Man in issue #190. Animal Man was a minor character for his first twenty years, never gaining the popularity of other DC heroes such as Batman or Superman. He made only five, non-consecutive appearances in &quot;Strange Adventures&quot; (four of which were reprinted in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot;), followed by two appearances in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, two in &quot;Action Comics&quot;, and two in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot;, appearing in consecutive issues of each. These eleven stories constitute the entirety of his pre-Crisis appearances. He later became one of several DC properties, such as Shade, the Changing Man and Sandman, to be revived and revamped in the late 1980s for a more mature comics audience. As seen in &quot;Strange Adventures&quot; #195, he was billed as a &quot;full-time hero&quot;, an aspect that would be the most changed by the revamp.

==Publication history==
===Beginnings===

Film stunt man Buddy Baker, to whom aliens gave animal-themed powers, debuted in &quot;Strange Adventures&quot; #180 (cover-dated September 1965), in the story &quot;I Was the Man with Animal Powers&quot; by writer Dave Wood and penciler Carmine Infantino. Baker gained a costume and a name, initially A-Man, in &quot;Strange Adventures&quot; #190 (July 1966). He continued as a semi-regular feature in the book, making occasional cover appearances, through #201 (June 1967).

His subsequent appearances were sporadic. In 1980, he had a guest appearance in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #267–268. His main appearances in the remainder of the decade were as a member of the &quot;Forgotten Heroes&quot;, a team of minor DC heroes. It was in that capacity that he appeared in the company-wide crossover storyline &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;.

===Grant Morrison revival===
In the late 1980s, following the slate-cleaning &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; event, DC began employing innovative writers, many of them young and from the U.K., to revamp some of their old characters. In the period that saw Alan Moore reinvent the Swamp Thing, Animal Man was reimagined by Scottish writer Grant Morrison. Morrison wrote the first 26 issues of the &quot;Animal Man&quot; comic book, published between 1988 and 1990, with art by Chas Truog and Doug Hazlewood; Brian Bolland provided the covers.

Although the series was initially conceived as a four-issue limited series, it was upgraded into an ongoing series following strong sales. Consequently, Morrison developed several long-running plots, introducing mysteries, some of which were not explained until a year or two later. The title featured the protagonist both in and—increasingly—out of costume. Morrison made the title character an everyman figure living in a universe populated by superheroes, aliens, and fantastic technology. Buddy&#x27;s wife Ellen, his son Cliff (9 years old at the beginning of the series), and his daughter Maxine (5 years old) featured prominently in most storylines, and his relationship with them, as husband, father, and provider, was an ongoing theme.

The series championed vegetarianism and animal rights, causes Morrison supported. In one issue, Buddy helps a band of self-described eco-terrorists save a pod of dolphins. Enraged at a fisherman&#x27;s brutality, Buddy drops him into the ocean, intending for him to drown. Ironically, the man is saved by a dolphin.

Buddy fought several menaces, such as an ancient, murderous spirit that was hunting him; brutal, murderous Thanagarian warriors; and even the easily defeated red robots of an elderly villain who was tired of life. The series made deep, sometimes esoteric references to the entire DC canon, including B&#x27;wana Beast, the Mirror Master, and Arkham Asylum.

Soon after the launch of his series, Animal Man briefly became a member of Justice League Europe, appearing in several early issues of their series.

Following Morrison&#x27;s run, Peter Milligan wrote a six-issue story featuring several surreal villains and heroes, exploring questions about identity and quantum physics and utilizing the textual cut-up technique popularized by William Burroughs. Tom Veitch and Steve Dillon then took over for 18 issues, in which Buddy returned to his work as a movie stuntman and explored mystical totemic aspects of his powers. Jamie Delano wrote 29 issues with Steve Pugh as artist (with occasional issues by other artists, like Will Simpson), giving the series a more horror-influenced feel with a &quot;suggested for mature readers&quot; label on the cover, beginning with issue #51.

====Vertigo====
After Jamie Delano&#x27;s first six issues, wherein, among other things, he killed off the central character of Buddy Baker, created the &quot;Red&quot; (analogous to the &quot;Green&quot; of Swamp Thing) and resurrected Buddy as an &quot;animal avatar&quot;, the series became one of the charter titles of DC&#x27;s new mature readers Vertigo imprint with #57, and its ties to the DC Universe became more tenuous. Vertigo was establishing itself as a distinct &quot;mini-universe&quot; with its own continuity, only occasionally interacting with the continuity of the regular DC Universe. The title evolved into a more horror-themed book, with Buddy eventually becoming a non-human animal god. The superhero elements of the book were largely removed—since Buddy was reborn as a kind of animal elemental, and legally deceased, he discarded his costume, stopped associating with other heroes, and generally abandoned his crimefighting role. He co-founded the Life Power Church of Maxine to further an environmentalist message, drifting along U.S. Route 66 to settle in Montana. Delano&#x27;s final issue was #79, culminating in Buddy dying several more times.

Between issues #66 and #67, Delano also penned &quot;Animal Man&quot; Annual #1, focusing on Buddy&#x27;s daughter Maxine. It was the third part of Vertigo&#x27;s crossover event &quot;The Children&#x27;s Crusade&quot;. This event ran across the Annuals of the five then-Vertigo titles --- &quot;Animal Man&quot;, &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, &quot;Black Orchid&quot;, &quot;The Books of Magic&quot;, and &quot;Doom Patrol&quot;—book-ended by two &quot;Children&#x27;s Crusade&quot; issues co-written by Neil Gaiman, and starring his Dead Boy Detectives.

A brief run by Jerry Prosser and Fred Harper featured a re-reborn Buddy as a white-haired shamanistic figure before the series was canceled after the 89th issue due to declining sales.

===Back in the DCU===
After the cancellation of his own series, Animal Man made cameos in several other titles, returning to his standard costumed form.

He has been utilized in most of the recent DC company-wide crossovers fighting alongside other less-mainstream heroes, including &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; and &quot;52&quot;, the latter of which was co-written by Grant Morrison, as well as &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #25.

===&quot;The Last Days of Animal Man&quot; miniseries===
In 2009 Gerry Conway and artist Chris Batista produced &quot;The Last Days of Animal Man&quot;, a six-issue limited series telling the tale of Animal Man in the future. The series portrays a middle-aged Animal Man in the year 2024 on his final adventure.

===Relaunch===
As part of &quot;The New 52&quot;, DC Comics relaunched &quot;Animal Man&quot; with issue #1 in September 2011 with writer Jeff Lemire and artist Travel Foreman.

The relaunched &quot;Animal Man&quot; has been met with a great deal of critical acclaim. MTV Geek said: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to oversell this, but if there is a better book put out by DC during the month of September, I will eat the other 51 comics. It&#x27;s just that good&quot;. The A.V. Club writer Oliver Sava wrote that the &quot;first issue of Animal Man combines family drama, superhero action, and macabre horror into a cohesive story that is unique, yet still true to the history of Buddy Baker&quot;. Read/RANT said: &quot;Along with &quot;Action Comics&quot;, &quot;Animal Man&quot; is among the best the line has to offer&quot;, and gave the book an A+ overall, calling it the Must Read Book of the Week. Greg McElhatton at Comic Book Resources was less complimentary, giving the book 3.5 stars (out of 5): &quot;The art might be uneven in &quot;Animal Man&quot; #1, but the script is dynamite&quot;.

According to ICv2.com, the relaunched &quot;Animal Man&quot; #1 sold over 55,000 copies, while &quot;Animal Man&quot; #2 was one of the 50 best-selling comics in October 2011.

The storyline of the relaunched version essentially builds on previous Animal Man continuity with Buddy as a happily married family man and superhero. Buddy is forced to take his family on the run after he discovers that his daughter Maxine is the avatar of The Red (the force which sustains all animal life) and that agents of The Rot (the elemental force of decay that are also called The Black) are seeking to kill her.

==Fictional character biography==

Buddy Baker gained animal powers when he encountered a spaceship that blew up, infusing him with radiation. He used his powers to fight crime and ward off alien attackers.

He then joined the Forgotten Heroes group prior to the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. He was seen with this group during the Crisis.

Baker&#x27;s Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; origin was slightly altered, but it retained the essence of the original. While hunting as a teenager, he encountered a crashed spaceship that apparently endowed him with his abilities (the slight discrepancies between the two stories were addressed as Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; and Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; origins, and were acknowledged in-story, with the &quot;original&quot; Buddy Baker appearing, and not wishing to be written out of existence). After an apparently unsuccessful stint as a superhero, followed by a hiatus where he utilized his powers to work as a film stuntman, Baker decided to restart and make a career out of it after being inspired by the headline-making Justice League International; this is where his self-titled series begins.

He is married to his high school sweetheart, Ellen, a storyboard artist and, later, an illustrator for children&#x27;s books. They have two children, Cliff and Maxine, who are a pre-teen and toddler, respectively, when the series starts. They live in a suburban area outside of San Diego.

Through the series, Animal Man becomes a man of great compassion toward all creatures, an ardent animal rights activist, an environmentalist, and a vegetarian. Later, he finds his link to the M-field has been passed on to his daughter, Maxine, who is also connected to the animal kingdom. Although he wears a mask, he goes to no great lengths to conceal his true identity. A jacket was added to Animal Man&#x27;s costume (so he could have pockets and a place to put his keys as well as notes from his wife). However, this jacket was denim and not a leather jacket: Buddy specifically discusses that he will not wear leather, out of moral considerations.

An early aspect of the character was his desire for fame, and is manifested by his wish to be in the Justice League. He is initially driven by a desire for the publicity from interviews and public appearances more than any altruistic impulse. Buddy joins the newly formed Justice League Europe and bonds with Dmitri of the Rocket Reds over the shared experiences of being fathers. He soon resigns due to tragic events taking place later in his series.

After a brief period of reconditioning and exploration of his limits, Baker&#x27;s first work is a job from S.T.A.R. Labs investigating a break-in at an animal testing facility. He traces it to the hero B&#x27;wana Beast, whom he is able to befriend and aid. The conditions he witnesses at the testing facilities compel him to become vegetarian, a sudden decision that briefly puts him at odds with his family. Baker also becomes a staunch animal rights activist and goes on several missions with environmental themes.

During his further adventures, he experiences glitches with his powers. He also begins experiencing evidences of his existence within a comic book, although he does not immediately understand them for what they are. He is targeted for murder by a mysterious organization upset with his environmental work, and must face the new Mirror Master. Baker is also pursued by Dr. James Highwater, a physicist with no memory of any prior existence, and seemingly no purpose other than to contact Baker. A parallel story involves a pair of yellow aliens (described as &quot;agents of some unspecified &#x27;higher power&#x27;&quot; that engineered the spaceship wreck that granted his powers) who are aware of the events of the Crisis and monitor Baker&#x27;s actions. They are aware of &quot;a second Crisis&quot; coming, which they believe that only Animal Man can avert. They reconcile the two variations of Animal Man&#x27;s origin through an unexplained &quot;surgery&quot; that also extends his abilities. Elsewhere, in Arkham Asylum, the Psycho-Pirate, aware of &quot;continuity&quot; and his fictional environment, opens a gateway into the real world and other comic book realities and begins bringing several characters no longer in continuity into existence.

Baker is demoralized, however, when firefighters are injured in a laboratory blaze started by activists that he was working with. He is approached by Highwater just as he decides to give up his costumed identity. While away on a vision quest with Highwater, in which he learns the true nature of his powers and briefly sees the comic&#x27;s reader, Baker&#x27;s family is brutally murdered by an assassin sent by the corporate heads seeking to stop his environmental work. With the help of the Mirror Master (who had turned down the hit), Baker tracks down the businessmen and assassin and kills them. While trying to undo his family&#x27;s deaths with a time machine, Baker accidentally becomes warped through time and meets the Phantom Stranger, Jason Blood, and the Immortal Man in the 1960s, who help him learn to accept his grief. Baker is then contacted by the aliens and taken to Arkham, where he stops the Psycho-Pirate and prevents damage to the continuity. Baker is transported to Limbo and encounters several comic book characters who are not being used in stories. Ultimately, Baker encounters his own writer (Grant Morrison themself), and the two share a conversation on the relationship between the creator and the fictional characters whose lives they write. After this encounter, Baker is sent back home and his family are restored back to life; it is left ambiguous as to whether or not Baker remembers the full nature of these events.

Next, after falling into a coma, Buddy finds himself in a strange alternative reality, which he correctly deduces is a divergent phase of existence and is then able to return home.

Having since left the Justice League, Baker resumes his stunt work career. He also finds himself frequently displaying uncontrolled animalistic behavior. He is assaulted by a neighbor, Travis Cody, a burnout with a PhD in electronic engineering from MIT. Cody has deduced that Baker&#x27;s powers have become skewed, and that unfocused usage of his abilities kills animals. After reaching an understanding, the two work together to measure and enhance Animal Man&#x27;s powers. They are themselves targeted by a group of shamans, one of whom was present at Animal Man&#x27;s origin, and who are aware of the yellow aliens and the writer. During this time, Baker&#x27;s daughter Maxine begins demonstrating powers similar to his own and is able to communicate with the head shaman, who is attempting to bring Baker to him.

S.T.A.R. Labs again contacts Baker, offering a position as their spokesman on environmentalism, but he declines. After an accident in which Baker kills the entire population of the San Diego Zoo, his wife takes their daughter to live with her mother in Vermont to avoid the media attention. Baker descends into depression and his son runs away, eventually ending up with an uncle, a lecherous predator. Baker goes to Vermont as well, where he finally meets the shaman. Meanwhile, Cody has been hired by S.T.A.R. Labs for his expertise, and while there he uncovers a conspiracy involving one of the shamans, but is mentally trapped in cyberspace.

Baker continued to split his time between his family, his career as Animal Man, and regular stunt work for films. He occasionally lent his talents to various superhero groups, including the JLA and the Forgotten Heroes, and played a prominent role in the Swamp Thing&#x27;s task force, the Totems.

===Post-series===
This marked the reappearance of Buddy in costume, and heralded his return to the mainstream DC Universe (although his Vertigo appearances were clearly meant to take place inside the DCU as well). He subsequently appeared alongside Aquaman, Hawkman, and the Resurrection Man. In &quot;JLA&quot; #27 (March 1999), Buddy officially joins the League to battle a rampaging Amazo in the Florida Everglades; however, since Amazo was able to mimic the powers of any and all members of the League, they were only able to defeat Amazo by disbanding the League. Buddy does not stay for the reorganization. During a JLA crossover event, Animal Man&#x27;s expertise in the morphogenetic field assists the League.

Animal Man also makes an appearance in the &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; limited series, helping to search for the murderer of Sue Dibny.

Animal Man kept out of the spotlight during the OMAC Project that was happening, and was very devastated when he heard the news that his good friend Rocket Red VII was killed by the OMACS in Moscow. The two of them had been good friends since the JLE back in the 80&#x27;S, they both had families, and got along quite well in the JLE.

After encountering danger signs from the animal world, Animal Man is recruited by Donna Troy as part of a team journeying to New Cronos to stop the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, mirroring his role in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, in which he journeyed into space with the Forgotten Heroes on Brainiac&#x27;s ship. During this adventure, he formed a mentoring friendship with the new Firestorm, Jason Rusch.

Due to a malfunction of the Zeta Beam, which Adam Strange deploys to return the team to Earth, Animal Man, along with most of the heroes, go missing after &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;. Eventually, some of the heroes are recovered, but Animal Man, Adam Strange, and Starfire are still missing. They become core East Coast members of DC&#x27;s weekly series &quot;52&quot;.

===&quot;52&quot;===

In &quot;52&quot;, Animal Man, Starfire, and Adam Strange are stranded on an alien planet. The trio escape, but are pursued by bounty hunters. They are joined by Lobo. In issue #36, during a battle with Lady Styx and her horde, Animal Man is killed by a necrotoxin, which causes its victims to rise again in the service of Lady Styx. Animal Man makes Starfire promise not to let him come back as a zombie. He gestures to the reader, saying, &quot;Look, they&#x27;re cheering us on. I told you the universe likes me&quot;. At the moment of his death, Ellen, still on Earth, senses his death and begins to cry.

In issue #37, moments after Starfire and Adam Strange leave Animal Man in space, Buddy comes back to life. The aliens who originally granted him his powers stand next to him, saying: &quot;And so it begins&quot;. After plucking him out of the timestream and repairing his body, they leave him in outer space. Animal Man must reach out to another life form to survive, and claims the abilities of a group of Sun-Eaters, including their homing sense. He observes his wife from a wormhole in space provided by the aliens, only to discover that Ellen is seeing another man (though it is later revealed she only reluctantly went out with one of Buddy&#x27;s friends).

Buddy returns to Earth, describing the marvels of space to his delighted family. Ellen throws a party to celebrate his return, but some followers of Lady Styx appear, bent upon killing the family. They are eliminated by Starfire, who has only partially recovered from wounds suffered in space. She delivers Buddy&#x27;s jacket and faints from weakness and surprise when she sees him alive, leaving the family to care for her.

===&quot;Countdown to Adventure&quot;===
Animal Man joined Adam Strange and Starfire in the series titled &quot;Countdown to Adventure&quot; written by Adam Beechen. The first issue reveals that his family has been caring for Starfire, who still has not regained her powers. Buddy convinces Ellen to let Starfire stay and act as a nanny to his two children. When a strange form of madness infects the people of San Diego, he and Starfire team up to stop it. Buddy&#x27;s closeness to Starfire has made Ellen disgruntled, thinking that Buddy is in love with her. Buddy&#x27;s powers have been in a state of flux, not working at all at some times and manifesting strange abilities at others, such as creating a whirlwind or firing energy beams. Once their extraterrestrial trip is done, Starfire leaves the Baker home, telling them that they will always be in her heart.

===Anansi===
In &quot;Justice League of America&quot; vol. 2 #25, Buddy is drawn into Vixen&#x27;s animal totem and captured by the trickster god Anansi, who claims to be the one who gave Buddy his powers, having disguised himself as the aliens (whilst reminding Vixen and Buddy that he constantly lies). Anansi also mentions that Buddy&#x27;s new powers were a side effect of his manipulation of Earth&#x27;s morphogenic field. After escaping the totem and defeating Anansi, Animal Man went back to the JLA Headquarters to thank the JLA for their aid. The Black Canary and Wonder Woman told Buddy that there is a seat for him in the JLA. Buddy declined, choosing to focus on his family and remain a part-timer. Buddy used the JLA teleporter to return home to his wife and kids in San Diego.

===&quot;Cry for Justice&quot;===
Buddy appears in the second half of writer James Robinson&#x27;s miniseries event &quot;Justice League: Cry for Justice&quot;. While he and his family are entertaining Starfire and Donna Troy, Buddy is approached by Mikaal Tomas and Congorilla, who ask him for help in tracking down the supervillain Prometheus. He accompanies them to the JLA Watchtower to seek help from the Justice League, and is present when the Red Arrow is mauled by an unknown attacker. While searching for the Red Arrow&#x27;s assailant, Buddy is assaulted by Prometheus disguised as Freddy Freeman.

During the finale, Buddy is seen helping Starfire and Firestorm rescue survivors after Prometheus destroys Star City.

===&quot;Blackest Night&quot;===
During the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; event, Nekron, the Lord of the Dead, reveals that all those who have returned from the dead, such as Buddy, were allowed to do so to become his &quot;inside agents&quot;. A black power ring attaches itself to Buddy, canceling out his resurrection and transforming him into a Black Lantern. In the final battle, Animal Man is freed by the power of white light.

===Starman/Congorilla===
Following the events of &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Buddy helps Starman and Congorilla during their search for the Fountain of Youth, using his abilities to help translate for Rex the Wonder Dog. Buddy is later revealed to be a member of the JLA&#x27;s reserve team, and joins the League during their battle against Eclipso. Shortly after joining the battle, Buddy and his teammates are possessed by Eclipso. The reserve JLA members are all freed after Eclipso is defeated.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
In &quot;The New 52&quot;, Buddy Baker has returned to his role as an environmental activist and actor. After his daughter Maxine manifests powers of her own, they journey into The Red, where they learn that Maxine must fight a battle between The Red and The Rot. The Baker Family travels cross country to unite with Swamp Thing. Buddy&#x27;s son Cliff sacrifices himself in battle with The Rot.

Animal Man appears as a member of the Justice League of America. After the events in Justice League United, Animal Man takes a break to care for his family.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
In 2017, after the events depicted in the series &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, Animal Man became a reserve member of the new Justice League. He helped the Justice League alongside other new reserve members like Adam Strange and the Swamp Thing. In the aftermath of the &quot;Justice League: No Justice&quot; series Animal Man&#x27;s name was mentioned in the new Justice League series by Wonder Woman. Animal Man was seen helping Vixen fix the Earth alongside the rest of the Justice League. He was later seen helping the Justice League fight the Legion of Doom and protecting a doorknob key from getting into the hands of the Legion. Animal Man was latterly seen with the rest of the Justice League, Justice League Dark, and the Teen Titans at a get-together party in the Hall of Justice.

Animal Man was summoned - along with the JLA, the Teen Titans and the JSA - by Batman to fix the Source Wall in anticipation of a forthcoming war across the multiverse. Animal Man then assisted these teams in a cross universe battle to defeat Perpetua and Lex Luthor&#x27;s Legion of Doom.

During the &quot;Dark Nights: Death Metal&quot; storyline, Animal Man was among the prisoners in New Apokolips after The Batman Who Laughs and his Dark Knights took over Prime-Earth. They were freed when Wonder Woman, Batman, and Harley Quinn rescued Superman from the control of Darkfather. During the hero&#x27;s fight with Robin King, Animal Man accompanied Red Tornado and Blue Beetle into battle against Robin King. However, Robin King kills Red Tornado, causing an explosion that kills Animal Man. Batman later revives him using a Black Lantern ring.

Animal Man then featured in a small cameo in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #780. Animal Man and other Justice League members were in the cafeteria having lunch. They were surprised to see Wonder Woman walk past them. She had returned to the Justice League following the events of the &quot;Dark Nights: Death Metal&quot; storyline series.

In &quot;DC Halloween Special&quot;, Animal Man works to protect his daughter Maxine from her classmates, who are bullying her because of her animal powers.

During the &quot;&quot; event, Animal Man attempts to help the Teen Titans battle the Necrostar. However, after Beast Boy turns into a Starro to fight the Necrostar, has his mind suppressed by Doctor Hate, and spreads spores around the world that transform people into animal hybrids, Animal Man is overwhelmed by the Red destabilizing and loses control of his powers.

Animal Man was seen in DC vs Vampires series. Animal Man was in the wild while his wife and kids where prisoners in there house looking for Vampire blood to live on. Buddy Baker family trapped him in the cellar leaving him as there prisoner while his family went out to look and hunt for food leaving Animal Man locked up in the cellar of his house.

==Powers and abilities==
Buddy can mimic the abilities of any animal as a result of his encounter with a crashed alien spacecraft. He does this by either focusing on a specific animal near him, or, as he learns later, by drawing power from the animal kingdom in general (this enables him to even mimic extinct animals). The nature of these powers has been described in various ways, including the superficial &quot;alien radiation&quot; explanation of his early appearances, the reconstruction of his body by aliens with &quot;morphogenetic grafts&quot; at the cellular level, and, currently, mystical access to a &quot;morphogenetic field&quot; created by all living creatures, also known as &quot;The Red&quot;. He does not grow wings to fly as a bird (instead he flies in classic &quot;Superman style&quot;), nor does he form gills to breathe underwater when mimicking a fish, but he has occasionally been known to mimic the actual appearances of animals, such as adopting the claws of a wolverine temporarily, or his metamorphosis toward the end of Delano&#x27;s run on his series.

Among the &quot;animal powers&quot; Buddy has been known to use are:
* The strength of a &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;.
* The flight of a bird.
* The swimming ability of a fish.
* The speed of an ant.
* The reflexes of a fly.
* The eloquence of a parrot.
* The wall-crawling of a spider.
* The sonic blast of a pistol shrimp.
* The sense of smell of a moth.
* The stench of a skunk.
* The color changing of a chameleon.
* The agility of a snake.
* The playfulness of a kitten.
* The electricity of an electric eel and electric ray.
* The ability of a worm to re-grow lost body parts.
* The righteous anger of a mother bear.
* The bark of a large dog.
* The reproduction abilities of protozoa.
* The durability of a cockroach.
* The ability to &quot;fire lightning from his face&quot; from an unidentified alien creature.
* The beauty of a monarch butterfly.
* The smell of a hippopotamus.
* The napping ability of a cat.

The level of Buddy&#x27;s abilities is proportional to the size of the animal they are drawn from. Hence, drawing the jumping ability from a flea would allow him to cover great distances. However, taking the abilities of a larger animal does not result in diminished power for him. In some appearances, he can also talk to animals and enter their minds.

Tapping into the Red, Animal Man can also fire blasts of force or unidentified energy. In cooperation with Vixen and the woman known as &quot;Tristess&quot;, he helped to create an entire universe.

In &quot;52&quot;, Buddy experiences an upgrade that allows him to connect to the universe&#x27;s morphogenetic field, providing him unlimited access to all animals in the universe regardless of origin. At first, Animal Man knew nothing about the alien creatures whose abilities he took, but later has ample knowledge.

==History==
Founded in 1618 by men from Tomsk as a Cossack &quot;ostrog&quot; (fort) on the Tom River, it was initially called &quot;Kuznetsky ostrog&quot; (). It became the seat of Kuznetsky Uyezd in 1622. &quot;Kuznetsk&quot; () was granted town status in 1689. It was here that Fyodor Dostoevsky married his first wife, Maria Isayeva in 1857. Joseph Stalin&#x27;s rapid industrialization of the Soviet Union transformed the sleepy town into a major coal mining and industrial center in the 1930s. It merged with Sad Gorod in 1931. From 1931 to 1932, the city was known as &quot;Novokuznetsk&quot; and between 1932 and 1961 as &quot;Stalinsk&quot; (), after Stalin. As a result of de-Stalinization, it was renamed back to &quot;Novokuznetsk&quot;.

<doc id="539380" wikidata="Q5086714" url="?curid=539380" title="Charter 88">
<text>Charter 88 was a British pressure group that advocated constitutional and electoral reform and owes its origins to the lack of a written constitution. It began as a special edition of the &quot;New Statesman&quot; magazine in 1988 and it took its name from Charter 77 – the Czechoslovak dissident movement co-founded by Václav Havel. It was a successor to the popular mid-19th century Chartist Movement of England that resulted in an unsuccessful campaign for a People&#x27;s Charter and also Magna Carta or &#x27;Great Charter&#x27; of 1215. In November 2007, Charter 88 merged with the New Politics Network to form Unlock Democracy.

==History==

===Formation===
Charter 88 was created by 348 mainly Liberal and Social Democratic British intellectuals and activists. They signed a letter to the &quot;New Statesman&quot; magazine as &quot;a general expression of dissent&quot; following the 1987 General Election victory of the Conservative Party, led by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. This was then followed by further advertisements in &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot;. Five thousand signatures were published in &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper in January 1989, followed by the establishment of an organisation.

The organisation was offered space within the offices of the &quot;New Statesman&quot; magazine, then based in Shoreditch. For several years it was based in offices in Exmouth Market, Clerkenwell. It later moved to the Institute of Community Studies (now The Young Foundation) in Bethnal Green. Its initial activity resulted in the creation of a Charter which the public was invited to sign and to support with financial contributions. Anthony Barnett was the first Director and Andrew Puddephatt, former General Secretary of Liberty, became the director of Charter 88 in 1995.

===Source of inspiration===
Charter 88 was the brainchild of &quot;New Statesman&quot; editor Stuart Weir and came into existence as a direct response to Thatcherism in Britain in the 1980s. It closely followed the methodology that had been employed by Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia during 1977. Charter 77 originally appeared as a manifesto published in a West German newspaper that was signed by Czechoslovak citizens representing various occupations, political viewpoints, and religions. The manifesto was reprinted and circulated as a document inviting other signatures and by the mid-1980s it had been signed by 1,200 people.

===The Original Charter 88===
The Original Charter of Charter 88 was explicitly concerned with institutional change:

===Support===
Since 1988, approximately 85,000 people have signed the Charter, over which time the aim of the movement has changed considerably.

Among its early supporters in the British entertainment industry was singer Billy Bragg. He had earlier given his support to the left-wing Red Wedge British youth political movement. Red Wedge closely allied itself with Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock in his unsuccessful attempt to defeat the Conservative Party. The writer Harold Pinter, composer Simon Rattle, actor John Cleese and actress Emma Thompson were also early supporters. Other signatories from the entertainment world included actor Ray McAnally, who played the left-wing Prime Minister in the TV film &quot;A Very British Coup&quot;, whilst other famous names included novelists Salman Rushdie, Ian McEwan, Julian Barnes, A.S. Byatt, Margaret Drabble, and Angela Carter.

Other famous signatories included Martin Amis, Melvyn Bragg, Tim Clement-Jones, Judi Dench, Terry Eagleton, Antonia Fraser, Clement Freud, Stuart Hall, and Christopher Hitchens.

Signatory Lord Scarman chaired the launch in the House of Commons of Charter 88&#x27;s strategy document &#x27;We can Make it Happen in the Next Ten years&#x27;, and remained a behind the scenes influence.

The intellectual left provided notable signatories however in the form of Ralph Miliband, Robin Blackburn and feminist Sheila Rowbotham.

In 1988 Neil Kinnock is alleged to have described Charter 88 as a movement of &quot;whiners, whingers and wankers&quot;, though he and his wife Glenys Kinnock later signed the charter. Tony Blair acknowledged his agreement with many of the aims and intentions of Charter 88.

===People===

*Ron Bailey 2004 – 2006 (co-director);
*Peter Facey 2004 – 2006 (co-director), 2006 – 2007

===Later developments===

In June 2003, the chair of the Charter 88 executive and management committee and active contributor Paul Hirst died suddenly. Along with this, the organisation&#x27;s financial situation and a period of resignations and redundancies, created a crisis situation in late 2003.
From 2004, Charter 88 developed partnerships with two organisations:
*The New Politics Network was created in 2000 following the winding up of Democratic Left.
*Active Citizens Transform, founded in 2004 by Charles Secrett, former executive director of the environmental organisation Friends of the Earth and by Ron Bailey.

On 8 February 2005, Charter 88 and the New Politics Network launched the Elect the Lords Campaign, which began with an advert in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper.

It worked to introduce the Armed Forces (Parliamentary Approval for Participation in Armed Conflict) Bill in Parliament, in cooperation with Clare Short. In 2006, Active Citizens Transform was wound up and subsumed within Charter 88. Local Works, ACT&#x27;s campaign for the Sustainable Communities Bill continued successfully and the legislation received Royal Assent in October 2007.

Members of Charter 88 and the New Politics Network were balloted in March 2007 on a proposed merger of the two organisations. The proposal was passed and the new organisation called Unlock Democracy was established in November 2007.

<doc id="539389" wikidata="Q234048" url="?curid=539389" title="Soestdijk Palace">
<text>Soestdijk Palace ( ) is a palace formerly belonging to the Dutch royal family. It consists of a central block and two wings.

Although named after the village of Soestdijk, which is largely in the municipality of Soest, Soestdijk Palace is just north of the border in the municipality of Baarn in the province of Utrecht. It was the home for over six decades of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands and her husband, Prince Bernhard, until their deaths in 2004.

== History ==
=== De Graeff ===
In the middle of the seventeenth century, the country house on the Zoestdijk was built for Cornelis de Graeff. In the years 1655–1660, de Graeff was involved in the education of William III of Orange, as can be seen from his letters in Soestdijk to the States General and his nephew Johan de Witt. During the summers, the family spent a lot of time at the palace, and de Graeff&#x27;s sons (Pieter and Jacob de Graeff) played with the young William. In 1674, after the &quot;rampjaar&quot;, Jacob de Graeff sold the property for the low price of 18,755 guilders to Stadtholder William III.

=== Orange-Nassau ===
The palace originally started as a hunting lodge that was built between 1674 and 1678 by Maurits Post, who was also involved in building two other royal palaces, Huis ten Bosch Palace and Noordeinde Palace. William left the Netherlands in 1688 to reside in London as William III of England.

A forest, the Baarnse Bos, is adjacent to the palace. It was developed as a French landscape garden between 1733 and 1758.

During the French invasion in 1795, the palace was seized as a spoil of war and turned into an inn for French troops. When Louis Bonaparte became King of Holland, he took possession of it and had it extended and refurnished.

It was presented to the Prince of Orange (the later William II of the Netherlands) in 1815 in recognition of his services at the Battle of Waterloo. From 1816 to 1821, the palace was significantly expanded by adding two wings, the northern or Baarn wing, and the southern or Soest wing. In 1842, its contents were enriched by the addition of the neoclassical furnishings of his former palace in Brussels, today the Palais des Académies.

William II and his wife Anna Pavlovna spent many summers at Soestdijk. Three of their children (Alexander, Henry and Ernest Casimir) were born at the palace. The princes were taught military drill on the lawns by their father, who also had working miniature cannons made for them. After William II&#x27;s death much of his property was sold off to settle his considerable debts. Anna Pavlovna bought Soestdijk and made it her summer residence. She designated rooms in the palace to preserving the memory of her late husband and son Alexander. After Anna Pavlovna died in 1865 she left Soestdijk to her son Henry, who died without issue in 1879. His brother king William III, the next owner, preferred Het Loo to Soestdijk. Only after his death in 1890 did the Royal family (which at the time consisted only of his widow Queen Emma and his daughter Queen Wilhelmina) start spending every other summer at the palace. This arrangement stayed more or less in place until Wilhelmina&#x27;s marriage in 1901, when her court and her mother&#x27;s court separated. Queen Emma kept Soestdijk as her summer residence until her death in 1934. The palace was mostly unused until Princess Juliana and her husband Prince Bernhard moved there after their wedding in 1937. As a gift to the newlyweds it was extensively renovated and modernised. In a break with tradition Juliana didn&#x27;t use Soestdijk as just a summer residence. Instead she lived there fulltime, even after ascending the throne in 1948.

Soestdijk became the property of the state of the Netherlands in 1971, although it was used by Princess Juliana (Queen of the Netherlands from 1948 to 1980) and Prince Bernhard as their official residence until both of their deaths in 2004. Soestdijk Palace then remained empty and unused for over a year before its opening to the public. From spring 2006 to 2017, it was possible to visit, pending a decision about its future use.

=== Sale in 2017 ===
The palace was sold in 2017 to a consortium named Made By Holland, which plans to develop a hotel, event centre and 65 houses on the grounds.

<text>Joseph Henry Nuxhall (; July 30, 1928 – November 15, 2007) was an American left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball, primarily for the Cincinnati Reds. Immediately after retiring as a player, he became a radio broadcaster for the Reds from 1967 through 2004, and continued part-time up until his death in 2007. Nuxhall held the team&#x27;s record for career games pitched (484) from 1965 to 1975, and still holds the team mark for left-handers. In addition to his 40 years of broadcasting Reds games, Nuxhall is most remembered for having been the youngest player ever to appear in a Major League game, pitching ⅔ of an inning for the Reds on June 10, 1944, at the age of . Called upon for that single game due to player shortages during World War II, Nuxhall eventually found his way back to the Reds in 1952, and the National League All-Star team in 1955 and 1956. Long known as &quot;The Ol&#x27; Left-hander,&quot; he compiled a career earned run average of 3.90 and a record of 135–117 during his 16-season career, with all but five of his victories being earned with the Reds. Nuxhall died in 2007 after a long battle with cancer.

==Early life==
Nuxhall was born and raised in Hamilton, Ohio. During World War II, many regular baseball players were unavailable while serving in the military. Meanwhile, Nuxhall was the biggest member of the ninth grade class in Hamilton at and —a left-hander with a hard fastball, but not much control. Nuxhall was playing in a semi-pro league with his father for a few years. Scouts looking to fill out the Reds&#x27; depleted roster were following Orville Nuxhall, Joe&#x27;s father, in 1943. But they were informed that the elder Nuxhall was not interested in signing a professional contract because of his five children. The scouts then became interested in Joe, who was only 14 at the time. After waiting until the following year&#x27;s basketball season was over, Nuxhall signed a major league contract with the Reds on February 18, 1944. General manager Warren Giles intended to wait until school was over in June to add him to the team, but more of his players were inducted into the service in the spring. With permission from his high school principal, Nuxhall was in uniform with the team on Opening Day.

==Teenage debut==
On June 10, 1944, the Reds were playing the first place (and eventual World Series champions) St. Louis Cardinals at Crosley Field and were trailing 13–0 in the ninth inning when Manager Bill McKechnie called on Nuxhall for mop-up relief. He started well, retiring the first batter he faced, shortstop George Fallon, on a groundout. But he was unable to get out of the inning, yielding five walks, two hits, one wild pitch and five runs. He spent the rest of the 1944 season in the minor leagues. But unlike Jake Eisenhart, who made his debut for the Reds the same day by getting the last out of the frame but didn&#x27;t return to the major league level after 1944, Nuxhall later returned to pitch in the majors eight years later in 1952.

Nuxhall remains the youngest individual to play in a major league game in history. During Nuxhall&#x27;s lifetime, it was believed that a 14-year-old named Fred Chapman pitched five innings in one 1887 game. But in 2009, the Society for American Baseball Research discovered that Chapman&#x27;s first name and age were both incorrect. The 1887 player was actually named Frank Chapman, and he was 25 at the time of his only major league appearance. There have also been sources listing a Billy Geer, who played for the 1874 New York Mutuals of the National Association, as being born in 1859; but this is questionable as well, as is whether the National Association was a major league.

Joe Reliford, a 12-year-old batboy for the Class D Fitzgerald Pioneers, became the youngest person ever to play in a professional baseball game in 1952, when he was called on to pinch-hit.

==Minor leagues==
Following his appearance with the Reds, he was assigned to the Birmingham Barons in the Southern League, but pitched only a third of an inning there (he struck out his first batter, then allowed a hit, five walks, a hit batter and five runs). Nuxhall attended spring training with the Reds in 1945. After school ended that spring, he pitched in the Reds minor league system for one season. Nuxhall then decided to return home until he finished high school the following year. He regained his amateur status and played football, basketball and baseball for Hamilton High School as a senior in 1945–‘46, earning all-state honors in football and basketball. Over the next five years, he played in the minor leagues with the Syracuse Chiefs, Lima Reds, Muncie Reds, Columbia Reds, Charleston Senators and Tulsa Oilers before returning to the Cincinnati Reds in 1952. He briefly returned to the minors in 1962 with the San Diego Padres.

==Return to the major leagues==
At the age of 23, Nuxhall returned to the majors. He pitched the final three innings of a 19–1 shellacking by the Brooklyn Dodgers on May 21, 1952, allowing one hit and no runs. Four days later, he took over for Herm Wehmeier in the fourth inning against the St. Louis Cardinals, but he allowed two runs on six hits in five innings of work and was credited with the 7–6 loss, his first in the majors. On July 13, he made his first career start against the New York Giants. In nine innings of work, he allowed four runs on nine hits, striking out two and walking three, but the Reds lost 4–2. A month later, he received his first win when he pitched three innings in relief of Harry Perkowski as the Reds rallied in the ninth to win 5–4 over the New York Giants. He allowed two hits and one run while striking out and walking two each. Ultimately, Nuxhall played in 37 games, going 1–4 with a 3.22 ERA in 92 innings, having one save while striking out 52 with 42 walks. In the fielding, he had 24 assists with three putouts and one errors and four double plays for a .964 fielding percentage. The following year, he went 9–11 with a 4.32 ERA, having five complete games and two saves in 141 innings. He had 69 walks and 52 strikeouts. In batting, he had 49 at-bats in 30 games, batting .327 (a career high), having 16 hits and three home runs with eight RBIs, four walks and 13 strikeouts. In fielding, he had six putouts, 18 assists, three errors on a .889 fielding percentage. The next year, he improved to 12–5 with a 3.89 ERA in 35 games and 166 innings. He had five complete games while having 59 walks and 85 strikeouts. He had four putouts, 29 assists, one error and five double plays for a .971 fielding percentage. He ranked 9th in strikeouts per 9 innings at 4.590, the first of five times he ranked in the top ten over nine seasons. He also ranked in the top ten in strikeouts/walks with 1.441 (9th) and 0.594 in home runs per 9 innings (4th)

Nuxhall blossomed in 1955, going 17–12 with a 3.47 ERA on 257 innings with five shutouts (a career and league high) while striking out 98 and walking 78. He had 12 putouts, 35 assists, three errors, four double plays for a .940 fielding percentage. He was named to the All-Star Game that year. He pitched 3 innings while allowing two hits and no runs with three walks and five strikeouts. Nuxhall ranked in the top ten in numerous categories in the National League that season, such as ERA (7th), wins (3rd), walks &amp; hits per inning (1.237, 7th), innings pitched (2nd), walks (5th), and hits (4th with 240).

The following year, he went 13–11 with a 3.72 ERA in 200 innings and 44 games, having three saves while throwing 10 complete games. He struck out 120 while walking 87 (a career high). He had six putouts, 31 assists, two errors and three double plays for a .949 fielding percentage. He was named to the All-Star Game once again, although he did not pitch. Nuxhall ranked in the top ten of a few categories in the NL, such as strikeouts (10th), strikeouts per nine innings (5.382, 4th), and walks (4th). The 91–63 record and 3rd-place finish by the Redlegs (in which they finished two games behind the Brooklyn Dodgers). This was the closest Nuxhall came to postseason action.

He stumbled the following year, going 10–10 with a 4.75 ERA in 39 games and 174 innings. He had 99 strikeouts and 53 walks. He had 11 putouts, 20 assists, four errors (a league high), and one double play turned for a .886 fielding percentage. He improved slightly in 1958, going 12–11 for a 3.79 ERA in 36 games and 175 innings. He had 111 strikeouts and 63 walks. He had six putouts, 29 assists, with three errors and double plays turned each on a .921 fielding percentage. He ranked sixth in hits per nine innings with 8.658 (10th) and strikeouts per nine innings with 5.687 (6th). The following year, he went 9–9 with a 4.24 ERA and one save in 29 games and 131 innings. He had 75 strikeouts and 35 walks. He had six putouts, 19 assists, with one errors and double play turned for a .962 fielding percentage. For 1960, he did not have the success of the past few years, going 1–8 with a 4.42 ERA in 38 games and 112 innings. He had 72 strikeouts and 27 walks. He had eight putouts, 26 assists, one errors and four double plays for a .971 fielding percentage.

On January 25, 1961, he was traded by the Reds to the Kansas City Athletics for John Briggs and John Tsitouris. In his one season with Kansas City, he went 5–8 with a 5.34 ERA in 37 games and 128 innings with one save, striking out 81 while walking 65. He had his second highest batting average at .292 in 65 at-bats, hitting 19 times while having two home runs and 13 RBIs, striking out 18 times while walking six times. He had 10 putouts, 13 assists, three errors and one double play for a .885 fielding percentage. On December 4, he was released by the Athletics.

He signed as a free agent with the Baltimore Orioles for the 1962 season, but on April 9, 1962 (one day before the season started), he was purchased by the Los Angeles Angels. In five games with the team, he had a 10.13 ERA while having no wins or losses, pitching 5 innings while allowing seven hits, six runs, five walks, and two strikeouts. On May 15, he was released. He signed back with the Reds roughly a month later. He went 5–0 with the Reds in twelve games for a 2.45 ERA with one save in 66 innings, striking out 57 while walking 25.

Nuxhall improved for the 1963 season, going 15–8 with a career low 2.61 ERA in 35 games and 217 innings (the second most inning work in his career). He had a career high 169 strikeouts along with 39 walks. He had five putouts, 33 assists, five errors and two double plays for a .884 fielding percentage. He won his 100th career game on June 29, beating the San Francisco Giants 7–3, pitching nine innings while allowing seven hits, two walks and 11 strikeouts.

Nuxhall regressed slightly the following year, going 9–8 with a 4.07 ERA in 32 games and 154 innings, striking out 111 while walking 51. He had five putouts, 20 assists, two errors and one double play turned for a .926 fielding percentage.

For 1965, he went 11–4 with a 3.45 ERA in 32 games and 148 innings, striking out 117 while walking 31 batters. He had five putouts, 13 assists, with no errors and no double plays for a 1.000 fielding percentage. On July 30, he pitched in his 441th game for the Reds, passing the team record of 440 games pitched by Eppa Rixey. In a nine inning effort, he allowed eight hits with one runs, eight strikeouts and no walks in a 5–1 win. Nuxhall&#x27;s final mark of 484 stood until Clay Carroll surpassed it in 1975.

The 1966 season (his 16th season along with his 15th for the Reds) proved to be his last in the majors. He went 6–8 with a 4.50 ERA in 35 games and 130 innings. He struck out 71 and walked 42 batters. He had six putouts, 20 assists, three errors, and one double play for a .897 fielding percentage. His final pitching appearance was on October 2, 1966, against the Atlanta Braves. He pitched in relief of Sammy Ellis in the top of the eighth inning with two outs and the Braves having taken the lead one batter earlier. Facing George Kopacz, Nuxhall got the batter to hit a flyball for an out to end the inning. He was replaced by Don Nottebart for the ninth inning.

Nuxhall was a better than average hitting pitcher in his major league career, posting a .198 batting average (152-for-766) with 76 runs, 15 home runs and 78 RBI. He also drew 40 bases on balls.

==Broadcasting career==
Nuxhall announced his retirement as an active player on April 1, 1967. Under the guidance of Hamilton sports broadcaster Ray Motley, he immediately joined the Reds broadcast team despite his lack of broadcasting experience.

Part of his trademark radio sign-off phrase—&quot;This is the old left-hander, rounding third and heading for home&quot;—is displayed on the outside of the Reds&#x27; stadium, Great American Ball Park, which opened in 2003. A likeness of Nuxhall is one of eight statues that decorate the main entrance of the stadium (The others are Ernie Lombardi, Ted Kluszewski, Frank Robinson, Johnny Bench, Joe Morgan, Tony Perez, and Pete Rose). 

Nuxhall was elected to the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1968, and officially retired from the Reds on October 3, 2004, 60 years after his pitching debut, though he still made guest appearances on some game broadcasts. For many years after retiring as a player and during his broadcasting career, Nuxhall pitched batting practice for the Reds. In addition to being called &quot;Nuxy&quot; and &quot;the ole lefthander&quot;, Nuxhall was also known as &quot;Hamilton Joe&quot;, particularly to locals. He spent nearly 62 of his 64 baseball seasons in the Reds organization as a minor-league player, major-league player or an announcer from 1944 to 2007; the only exceptions being 1946 (when he was on the &quot;voluntarily retired&quot; list—in reality, he went back to high school), 1961 (when he was dealt to the Kansas City A&#x27;s) and 1962 (pitching for a few weeks with the Los Angeles Angels, then half a season with the Reds&#x27; PCL farm club in San Diego before heading back to Cincinnati).

On June 6, 2007, the Reds honored Nuxhall, Marty Brennaman, and Waite Hoyt with replica microphones that hang on the wall near the radio booth. At Redsfest in December, 2007 the Reds announced Nuxhall would be honored throughout the 2008 baseball season—their uniforms would display a dark patch with the word &quot;NUXY&quot; printed in white. On March 31, 2008, the Cincinnati Reds paid tribute to Nuxhall by wearing his #41 jersey for opening day.

In December 2007, Nuxhall was named as one of the ten finalists for the National Baseball Hall of Fame&#x27;s Ford C. Frick Award, an honor bestowed annually on broadcasters who make major contributions to the game of baseball. Of more than 122,000 online ballots cast by fans, Nuxhall received 82,304 votes. Despite this show of support, it was announced on February 19, 2008, that the Frick election committee had voted in favor of the voice of the Seattle Mariners play-by-play announcer Dave Niehaus.

==Book and character education fund==
In September 2004, Orange Frazer Press released &quot;Joe: Rounding Third &amp; Heading for Home&quot;. A portion of the proceeds from the book benefits the Joe Nuxhall Character Education Fund, which was established in 2003 to underwrite character development programs and projects for children.

==Community remembrance==

In the days following Nuxhall&#x27;s death, several radio stations in the Cincinnati area devoted shows to him, and fans left cards, flowers and banners at the statue of Nuxhall at Great American Ball Park. A public visitation ceremony was attended by thousands of fans and several local and national sports and broadcasting personalities.
At his visitation held at Fairfield High School, an estimated 6,000 people showed up to pay their respects to Nuxhall and the Nuxhall family. The Hamilton Joes, a collegiate summer baseball team that competes in the Great Lakes Summer Collegiate League, was founded in 2008 and named in his honor. They first began playing in 2009 and won their first league championship in 2016.

==2008 Opening Day memorial==
The Reds remembered Nuxhall on their 2008 Opening Day. Players wore an alternate jersey during their introductions, which bore the number 41 and Nuxhall&#x27;s name on the back. Aaron Harang, who usually wore the number 39 jersey, was allowed by MLB to wear the number 41 jersey with Nuxhall&#x27;s name for the entire game. Nuxhall&#x27;s number 41 was honored by the team displaying it in left-center field over the Reds&#x27; bullpen. Reds players wore patches with &quot;Nuxy&quot; and his number 41 on them as a tribute.

<doc id="539397" wikidata="Q2914853" url="?curid=539397" title="Hazret Sovmen">
<text>Hazret Medzhidovich Sovmen ( ; ; born 1 May 1937) was the second president of the Republic of Adygea, Russia, having succeeded Aslan Dzharimov at the post. Sovmen is a university professor from Maykop. Before becoming President, Hazret Sovmen had been a successful businessman (with links to Russian entrepreneurs in Siberia), having started off as a bulldozer driver in a gold mine in Chukotka. He is the founder of &quot;Polyus Gold&quot;, Russia&#x27;s leading gold-mining company.

==Early life==

Sovmen was born in the &quot;aul&quot; of Afipsip in Takhtamukaysky District of Adyghe Autonomous Oblast in the Russian SFSR, Soviet Union. He served in the Black Sea Fleet and graduated from the Saint Petersburg Mining Institute. He started working at a gold mine in Chukotka in 1961 and worked in mines in the Krasnoyarsk Krai and Magadan Oblast. He became manager of the Polyus Mine in 1981. As president, he was the only regional head without any spouse.

==Political career==

Sovmen was elected to the office of President on 13 January 2002 by direct suffrage. He was faced with the challenges of leading one of Russia&#x27;s poorest republics, officially declared bankrupt by the Government of Russia. Sovmen was involved in political activities with the &quot;Slavic people Union&quot;, Adygeya&#x27;s principal opposition party. Russian President Vladimir Putin is believed to have supported Sovmen. In 1997, Russian President Yeltsin awarded him with the Order of Merit for the Fatherland 3rd class. On 13 January 2007, he was succeeded as Adygean President by Aslan Tkhakushinov.

He is a member of the United Russia party.

<text>The Cannonball River () is a tributary of the Missouri River, approximately long, in southwestern North Dakota in the United States.

It rises in the Little Missouri National Grassland, in the badlands north of Amidon in northern Slope County. It flows ESE past New England, Mott, and Burt. It is joined by Cedar Creek approximately southwest of Shields and flows northeast, past Shields, forming the northern border of Sioux County and the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. It joins the Missouri in Lake Oahe near Cannon Ball. The cannonball concretions found in the vicinity of this river are the source of its name.

<text>Noordeinde Palace (, ) is one of three official palaces of the Dutch royal family. Located in the city center of The Hague in the province of South Holland, it has been used as the official workplace of King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima since 2013. The Noordeinde Palace and its surrounding palace grounds are property of the Dutch State.

==Palace grounds==

The Noordeinde Palace building is located at the palace grounds in the city center of The Hague, which also contains the Royal Stables (Dutch: &quot;Koninklijke Stallen&quot;), Palace Gardens, Royal Archives, and Dome of Fagel. The Palace Gardens are open to the public daily between sunrise and sunset, while the buildings on the palace grounds are only open to the public during specific days of the year.

==From farmhouse to palace==
The palace originated as a medieval farmhouse, which was converted into a spacious residence by the steward of the States of Holland and West Friesland, Willem van de Goudt. The farmhouse was built at the borders of the city of The Hague in 1533, in a street called &quot;Int Nortende&quot; (now: &quot;Noordeinde,&quot; lit.: &quot;in the North End&quot;), while the building is located in the city center of modern The Hague. The original farmhouse&#x27;s cellars can still be seen in the palace basement.

From 1566 to 1591, the palace had a different owner. After that it was leased, and in 1595, purchased by the States of Holland for Louise de Coligny, the widow of William the Silent, and her son Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange. In recognition of William&#x27;s service to the nation, the States presented the building to his family in 1609.

Frederick Henry substantially enlarged the house, which was then known as the &quot;Oude Hof&quot;. He began by buying the surrounding plots of land. The architects Pieter Post and Jacob van Campen, who built Huis ten Bosch Palace in 1645, were among those involved in the alterations of 1640. The alterations included lengthening the main building and adding wings on either side, thus creating the characteristic H-form that is seen today.

After Frederik Hendrik died in 1647, his widow, Amalia of Solms-Braunfels, spent much of her time at the Oude Hof. Following her death in 1675, the house was more or less empty for many years. After the death of the Stadholder-king William III in 1702, it passed to King Frederick I of Prussia, a grandson of Frederick Henry&#x27;s.

In 1740, Voltaire stayed in one of the apartments while he negotiated with Dutch publisher Jan van Duren about the Anti-Machiavel.
In 1754, King Frederick the Great of Prussia sold his land-holdings in the Netherlands to Stadholder William V.

The son of Stadholder William V, who would become King William I, took up residence at the Oude Hof in 1792. But when the French invaded the Netherlands in 1795, during the French Revolutionary Wars, he and his family were forced to flee to Britain. The Oude Hof became the property of the Batavian Republic and hence state property, the status it has today.

==Royal palace==

In 1813, after the fall of Napoleon, Prince William returned to the Netherlands, where he was proclaimed Sovereign Prince.

The Constitution of the time decreed that the State must provide a summer and a winter home for the sovereign. Initially there were plans to build a new winter residence, but in the end it was decided to make extensive alterations to the Oude Hof. The palace was extended in 1814 to the back, including the addition of the Ballroom.

King William I moved into Noordeinde Palace in 1817, living there until his abdication in 1840. His successor, King William II, never resided there. Like his grandfather, King William III used Noordeinde as his winter home, though he preferred to live at his summer residence, Het Loo Palace in Apeldoorn. In 1876, he had the royal stables built in the gardens behind Noordeinde Palace.

Even after King William III married Queen Emma, the royal family continued to use Noordeinde as their winter home. Their daughter, Princess Wilhelmina, was born there in 1880, and Queen Emma and her daughter spent their winters at Noordeinde after the King&#x27;s death in 1890. In 1895, the Queen Regent had premises for the Royal Archives built in the grounds.

==Modern palace==

In 1901, Queen Emma moved to Lange Voorhout Palace, today&#x27;s Escher Museum, while Queen Wilhelmina and her husband Prince Hendrik remained at Noordeinde.

Until the German invasion in 1940, Queen Wilhelmina continued to make frequent use of Noordeinde Palace. After the war, the palace was again used as the Queen&#x27;s winter residence.

In 1948, the central section of the palace was destroyed by fire. That same year Juliana acceded to the throne. She preferred Soestdijk Palace as her official residence, though some members of the Royal Household continued to use offices in Noordeinde. Between 1952 and 1976 the International Institute of Social Studies was based in the north wing of the palace. Following a thorough restoration in 1984, the palace became the Dutch monarch&#x27;s workplace and office for all political and state affairs.

===Royal events===
The palace has been the wedding location of several members of the Dutch Royal family, e.g., former Queen and her husband, Juliana and Prince Bernhard, and the youngest brother of the Dutch King and his wife, Prince Constantijn and Princess Laurentien. Furthermore, Queen Juliana (2004), Prince Hendrik (1934), Prince Claus (2002) and Prince Bernhard (2004) lay in state at the Noordeinde Palace after their deaths.

<doc id="539438" wikidata="Q8004347" url="?curid=539438" title="William Allen (loyalist)">
<text>William Allen (August 5, 1704 – September 6, 1780) was a wealthy merchant, attorney and chief justice of the Province of Pennsylvania, and mayor of Philadelphia during the colonial era. At the time of the American Revolution, Allen was one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in Philadelphia. A Loyalist, Allen agreed that the colonies should seek to redress their grievances with British Parliament through constitutional means, and he disapproved of the movement toward independence.

He built a manor and country estate, known as Mount Airy, in 1750 outside Philadelphia; the neighborhood became known by his estate&#x27;s name and is now part of the city. In 1762, he founded what became Allentown, Pennsylvania, and had a hunting lodge there.

==Early life and education==
Allen was born in Philadelphia on August 5, 1704, the son of William Allen Sr., a successful Philadelphia merchant of Scots-Irish descent who had immigrated from Dungannon, County Tyrone, Ireland along with his brother, John, and father. The elder Allen had risen to prominence through close ties to William Penn, the proprietor of Pennsylvania.

As a youth, Allen spent much of his time in England for his education and refinement. In 1720, he was admitted to the Middle Temple in London to study law, and at the same time became a pensioner at Clare College at the University of Cambridge.

==Career==

Following his father&#x27;s death in 1725, Allen returned to Philadelphia to manage the family&#x27;s business interests. 

===Land acquisition for State House===
In spring 1729, Allen was named alongside lawyer Andrew Hamilton, his future father-in-law, as a trustee for the purchase and building fund to develop the State House in Philadelphia, then the capital of the province. Both men were authorized to buy the land for the project. By October 1730, Allen and Hamilton began to purchase lots on Chestnut Street at their own expense, the property on which the Pennsylvania State House, later known as Independence Hall, was built. By the will of Andrew Hamilton, dated July 31–August 1, 1741, Allen inherited all the land of the yard for the state house and its surrounding public grounds. They were to be managed by him and his brother-in-law James Hamilton. On September 13, 1761, Allen and Hamilton conveyed Lot no. 1 and the other pieces of land acquired to Isaac Norris II and the other trustees of the province. This completed the yard, which became the site of the State House and its surrounding public space.

===Political career===
Allen&#x27;s political career began in 1727 within Philadelphia’s city government, and by 1730, he was elected to the Pennsylvania House. There he supported William Penn&#x27;s sons and Andrew Hamilton, who had become speaker in 1729. Together, Hamilton and Allen led the Proprietary Party, which controlled the House for much of the 1730s. Allen also communicated with Proprietor Thomas Penn regarding colonial politics. In 1735, Allen was appointed mayor of Philadelphia. The following year, in 1736, he celebrated the opening of the nearly complete State House, later renamed Independence Hall, by hosting a feast for all residents and guests of the city; it was described at the time as &quot;the most grand, the most elegant entertainment that has been made in these parts of America.&quot;

In 1739, when both Allen and Hamilton retired from the House, the opposition Quaker Party, unhappy with the Proprietors&#x27; paper money policies and the governor&#x27;s support for war with Spain, regained control for the next seventeen years. Allen lost his bid for a seat in 1740, and in 1742, the Quakers accused him of inciting sailors to riot during the Philadelphia election to intimidate their voters. The riot was unsuccessful, and Allen never ran for a legislative seat in Philadelphia again.

Allen was appointed as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of colonial Pennsylvania, serving from 1751 to 1774. He resigned due to increasing tensions resulting from his Loyalist beliefs and health concerns. He was succeeded by Benjamin Chew.

In 1768, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

===Freemason===
Allen was a Freemason, a member of St. John&#x27;s Lodge No. 1, &quot;Moderns,&quot; Philadelphia, known as the Tun Tavern Lodge. Appointed Provincial Grand Master of Pennsylvania, &quot;Moderns&quot; on June 24, 1731, he is the second Grand Master of the Provincial Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania and also the youngest at 26 years old. Allen served two terms as Grand Master, the first from 1731 to 1732 and the second from 1747 to 1761.

===Benefactor===
In 1760, encouraged by William Smith, Allen sponsored the young painter Benjamin West&#x27;s trip to Italy. He established a £100 line of credit for West and, in a letter of introduction in 1760, called him &quot;a young ingenious Painter of this City, who is desirous to improve himself in that Science, by visiting Florence and Rome.&quot; A year later, Allen and his brother-in-law, the Governor James Hamilton, provided more money for West. He developed as one of the century&#x27;s most important painters and, from 1792 until his death in 1820, served as president of Britain&#x27;s Royal Academy. West referred to Allen as &quot;the principal of my patrons.&quot;

==Founding of Allentown, Pennsylvania==

In 1762, Allen laid out the plan of present-day Allentown, Pennsylvania, which he then called Northampton Town. The property was part of a plot which Allen had purchased in 1735 from his business partner Joseph Turner. He bought it from Thomas Penn, son of William Penn. Allen hoped that Northampton Town would displace Easton as the seat of Northampton County and also become a commercial center, due to its location along the Lehigh River and its proximity to Philadelphia.

Allen gave the property to his son James in 1767. Three years later, in 1770, James built a summer residence, Trout Hall, in the new town, near the site of his father&#x27;s former hunting lodge.

On March 18, 1811, the town was formally incorporated as a borough. On March 6, 1812, Lehigh County was formed from the western half of Northampton County, and Northampton Town was selected as the county seat. The town was officially renamed &quot;Allentown&quot; in 1838 after years of popular usage. It was formally incorporated as a city on March 12, 1867. Today, Allentown is the third largest city in Pennsylvania. In 1959, William Allen High School, the largest public high school in Allentown, was named in his honor.

==Mount Airy, Pennsylvania==

Allen built a mansion and country estate, called Mount Airy, on Germantown Avenue in 1750. The area eventually took the estate&#x27;s name, Mount Airy, as its own. The estate stood on what is today the campus of the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia.

In 1774, Allen, a Loyalist, moved to England, where he published &quot;The American Crisis: A Letter, Addressed by Permission of the Earl Gower, Lord President of the Council, on the present alarming Disturbances in the Colonies&quot;, which proposed a plan for restoring the American colonies to rule under British Crown. He remained in England throughout most of the American Revolution, and did not return to Philadelphia until 1779, after the British Army had evacuated.

==Personal life==

On February 16, 1734, Allen married Margaret Hamilton, daughter of Andrew Hamilton, defense lawyer in the 1735 Zenger case and sister of James Hamilton. William and Margaret had six children: John, Andrew, James, William, Anne, and Margaret. Like their father, Allen&#x27;s sons were Loyalists in the American Revolution.

Anne Allen married John Penn, a proprietor of the province with a one-fourth interest, who served as the last colonial governor of Pennsylvania. She lived with him for a time in exile in New Jersey during the British occupation of Philadelphia, but they returned to the city in 1788 and lived the remainder of their lives near there.

==Death==
On September 6, 1780, Allen died at home in the Mount Airy section of Philadelphia, at age 76, a year prior the end of the Revolutionary War in 1781. 

Advertisements from &quot;The Pennsylvania Gazette&quot; in 1732 show that Allen and his business partner Joseph Turner participated in the slave trade. Allen manumitted slaves he owned in his will.

==Honors==
* Allentown&#x27;s William Allen High School in Allentown, Pennsylvania, the third-largest public high school in Pennsylvania, is named in his honor.
* Allens Lane, a street in Mount Airy, Pennsylvania is named in his honor.
* Richard Allen Lane station, a SEPTA regional rail station, was named in his honor until 2022 when it was renamed in honor of Richard Allen.

<text>Vitals is a 2002 techno-thriller novel by American writer Greg Bear, nominated for a John W. Campbell Memorial Award in 2002.

The main protagonist is Hal Cousins, a scientist who wishes to find a way to prevent death. He gets his funding from angel investors – rich businessmen who are determined to live a thousand years. On an exotic ocean floor lifeform retrieval mission in a small deep sea vessel, his pilot goes berserk, starts spouting gibberish, and tries to kill him. He survives, but when he gets back to the ship, he finds that a member of the crew &quot;also&quot; went mad and started spouting gibberish, killing four scientists on board the ship. The rest of the crew is distant from him, on the grounds of what he calls &quot;bad mojo&quot;. He is disowned by the sponsor in question. Hal&#x27;s twin brother Rob is murdered, by someone who is later revealed to be Ben Bridger.

The story develops from there, taking in his twin brother&#x27;s widow, Lissa; Rudy Banning, a once respected professor and writer turned into an anti-semitic conspiracy theorist by a brain-altering microbe; and a scheming group of immortals who want to stay unique. They are able to do this because they have access to bacteriological research by Russian scientist Maxim Golokhov from the 1940s who was working for Beria and Stalin. Stalin possibly cameos in the story, but the issue is left vague.

There are five parts with different first-person narrators. Parts one, three, and five are narrated by Hal Cousins, and parts two and four are narrated by Benjamin Bridger.

By the end of the book, the main characters are all either dead, irrelevant, or the victim of mind-altering xenophages.

Some elements of the book relate to transhumanism and life extension. Biology is a major theme in Bear&#x27;s work, and bacteria and bacterial intelligence played a central role in his 1983 novel &quot;Blood Music&quot; as well.

<text>Kyparissia () is a town and a former municipality in northwestern Messenia, Peloponnese, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Trifylia, of which it is the seat and a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 101.018 km2. The town proper has around 5,000 inhabitants.

==Geography==

The town is situated on the Gulf of Kyparissia, a bay of the Ionian Sea, one of the main breeding grounds of the endangered loggerhead sea turtle. Kyparissia is 38 km north of Pylos, 46 km northwest of Kalamata and 51 km southeast of Pyrgos. The Greek National Road 9 (Pyrgos - Methoni) passes through the town. Kyparissia is the terminus of a now disused railway line from Kalo Nero, on the line from Pyrgos to Kalamata. The town has a port, which is mainly used for cargo purposes. On a hill east of the town centre lies a fortress built during the Frankish period.

===Subdivisions===
The municipal unit Kyparissia is subdivided into the following communities (constituent villages in brackets):
*Armenioi
*Faraklada
*Kyparissia (Kyparissia, Memi, Blemenianoi, Myloi, Rouzaki, Terpsithea)
*Mouriatada (Mouriatada, Karvouni)
*Myro (Myro, Alimaki)
*Perdikoneri
*Raches
*Spilia
*Stasio
*Vryses
*Xirokampos

==History==
The ancient Greek town Cyparissia () was already mentioned by Homer in his &quot;Iliad&quot;.

Ancient writers took note of Cyparissia&#x27;s beautiful situation upon the sides of one of the offshoots of the range of mountains, which run along this part of the Messenian coast. Upon the narrow summit of the rocks later occupied by a castle built in the Middle Ages, stood the ancient acropolis. There is no harbour upon the Messenian coast north of Pylos; but Leake remarks that the roadstead at Cyparissia seems to be the best on this part of the coast; and in ancient times the town probably possessed an artificial harbour, since traces of a mole may still be seen upon the sea-shore. This was probably constructed on the restoration of Messene by Epaminondas; for it was necessary to provide the capital of the new state with a port, and no spot was so suitable for this object as Cyparissia. Hence we find Messene and the harbour Cyparissia mentioned together by Scylax Pausanias found in the town a temple of Apollo, and one of Athena Cyparissia. The town continued to coin money down to the time of Severus.

Stephanus calls Cyparissia a city of Triphylia, and Strabo also distinguishes between the Triphylian and Messenian Cyparissia, but on what authority we do not know.

At a relatively late stage Cyparissia was a bishopric that today, no longer being residential, is listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.

In the Middle Ages it was called Arkadía, a name which was transferred from the interior of the peninsula to this place upon the coast. Under the Principality of Achaea, Kyparissia/Arkadia was the seat of the Barony of Arcadia, which was the last Frankish territory (except for the Venetian possessions) to fall to the Despotate of the Morea, in 1432.

In 1460 Kyparissia came under Ottoman control, and remained so, with the exception of thirty years of Venetian rule, until the Greek War of Independence which began in 1821.

Kyparissia continued to bear the name Arkadia till its destruction by Ibrahim Pasha in 1825, during the Greek War of Independence and when rebuilt it resumed its ancient name Cyparissia, by which it is now called. Some remains of ancient walls may be traced around the modern castle; and below the castle on the slope of the hill, near the church of Saint George, are some fragments of columns. On the south side of the town, close to the sea-shore, a fine stream rushes out of the rock and flows into the sea; and a little above is a basin with a spring of water, near which are some stones belonging to an ancient structure. This is the ancient fountain sacred to Dionysus, which Pausanias perceived near the entrance of the city, on the road from Pylus.

==Bishopric==
&quot;Ciparissia&quot; once was a (late Byzantine?) bishopric, apparently a suffragan of the Metropolis of Patras, in the sway of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, but it was suppressed without a single historically documented incumbent.

It was nominally restored in 1933 as a titular bishopric of the Roman Catholic Church. It is vacant since decades, having had the following incumbents of the fitting episcopal (lowest) rank:
* Arthur-Alfred Lepailleur, Holy Cross Fathers (C.S.C.) (1951.03.08 – death 1952.04.12) as emeritate
* Bishop-elect Joseph Oliver Bowers, Divine Word Missionaries (S.V.D.) (1952.11.27 – 1953.01.08) as Auxiliary Bishop of Accra (Ghana)
* Paul Etoga (1955.07.03 – 1961.06.24) as Auxiliary Bishop of Yaoundé (Cameroon)
* Gregorio Garavito Jiménez, Montfort Missionaries (S.M.M.) (1961.12.04 – 1969.04.26) as Auxiliary Bishop of Villavicencio (Colombia)

==Historical population==

==Famous residents==
*Dimitrios Pitsinis (1925–2003), Doctor/General Surgeon 
*Konstantinos Lamprinopoulos (1893-1965), politician, Mayor of Patras 
*Theodoros Roussopoulos (1963-), journalist, politician
*Kostis Palamas (1859-1943), poet

<doc id="539457" wikidata="Q2725351" url="?curid=539457" title="Denis Compton">
<text>Denis Charles Scott Compton (23 May 1918 – 23 April 1997) was an English multi-sportsman. As a cricketer he played in 78 Test matches and spent his whole career with Middlesex. As a footballer, he played as a winger and spent most of his career at Arsenal.

A right-handed batsman and left-arm unorthodox spin bowler, Compton is regularly credited as one of England&#x27;s most remarkable batsmen. Indeed, Sir Don Bradman said he was one of the greatest cricket players he&#x27;d ever seen. He is one of only twenty-five players to have scored over one hundred centuries in first-class cricket. In 2009, Compton was posthumously inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. The Denis Compton Oval and a stand at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground are both named in his honour.

==Cricket career==

===Early years===

Compton was born and brought up in what was then the urban district of Hendon, which later became part of Greater London; his father had moved there in hopes of finding more work. He was the second son and youngest child of Henry Ernest Compton, a self-employed painter and decorator, later a lorry driver when his business failed, and Jessie Anne ( Duthie); he had one elder brother, Leslie Harry (1912–1984) and one elder sister, Hilda Dorothy (1913–2002). He was educated at Bell Lane Primary School and joined the MCC ground staff at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground at the age of 15. The previous summer he had begun to make a name for himself when, at that same venue, he scored 114 as captain of an Elementary Schools XI, impressing Test selector Sir Pelham Warner.

By the late 1930s, Compton was one of England&#x27;s finest batsmen, and remained at the top of his profession for some twenty years. His dashing approach to batting and the sheer enjoyment he exuded endeared him to a generation of cricket lovers. As an all-rounder Compton was a right-hand bat and a slow left-arm wrist-spin bowler.

Compton earned his first England cap against New Zealand in 1937. At 19 years and 83 days, he remains the third youngest England debutant ever. He scored his first Test century aged just 20 years and 19 days in 1938 against Don Bradman&#x27;s touring Australians. This broke the record, set by J. W. Hearne in 1911, for the youngest Test century by an England batsman, and remains the record to this day. Later in the same series he scored a match-saving 76 not out at Lord&#x27;s; this innings was scored on a rain-affected pitch and greatly impressed Don Bradman. In 1939, he scored 2468 runs for the season, including 120 against the West Indies at Lord&#x27;s.

As with many other sportsmen of his generation, he lost some of his best years to the Second World War, during which he served in the army in India. He was posted at Mhow, Central India. He was granted permission to play for the Holkar team in the Ranji Trophy, India&#x27;s national cricket tournament. It was in India that he began his close friendship with his Australian counterpart, Test cricketer, footballer and national hero, Keith Miller. They played against each other in the match at Calcutta between the Australian Services team and East Zone.

The match was interrupted by rioting when Compton was on 94, and one of the rioters who had invaded the pitch ran up to Compton and said: &quot;Mr Compton, you very good player, but the match must stop now.&quot; This was a phrase which Miller gleefully recalled whenever Compton went out to bat against the Australians. In recognition of their amiable friendship and rivalry, the ECB and Cricket Australia decided in 2005 that the player adjudged the Player of the Series in the Ashes would be awarded the Compton–Miller medal.

===1947===

England toured Australia in the 1946–47 Ashes series and though they were beaten by the powerful Australian team, Compton distinguished himself by scoring a century in each innings of the Adelaide Test.

Back in England, Compton produced a season of cricket that established him as a British household name, and one of the greatest cricketers of his era. Helped by a rare summer of sunshine, Compton thrilled the war-weary English public with his cavalier batting. Against the touring South Africans, Compton scored five centuries, one for Middlesex and four for England, accumulating 1,056 runs at an average of 88. His aggregate in all matches that season was 3,816 runs, which remains the most ever made in a season in first-class matches. In that season, he scored 18 centuries, with the last one scored on 15 September 1947. Eighteen hundreds in a single season is another world record to his name.

According to journalist Frank Keating, Compton&#x27;s personal favourite innings of that summer was for Middlesex against Kent at Lord&#x27;s. Chasing 397 to win, and needing to score at nearly 100 runs per hour, Compton led the way with a dashing 168, but Middlesex fell short by 75 runs.

Cricket writers Neville Cardus and John Arlott acclaimed Compton&#x27;s achievements. Cardus wrote: 
Never have I been so deeply touched on a cricket ground as in this heavenly summer, when I went to Lord&#x27;s to see a pale-faced crowd, existing on rations, the rocket-bomb still in the ears of most, and see the strain of anxiety and affliction passed from all hearts and shoulders at the sight of Compton in full sail ... each stroke a flick of delight, a propulsion of happy, sane, healthy life. There were no rations in an innings by Compton.

Arlott, who had written his first cricket book that summer, concluded with a tribute to Compton:To close the eyes is to see again that easy, happy figure at the wicket, pushing an unruly forelock out of the eye and then as it falls down again, playing off the wrong foot a stroke which passes deep-point like a bullet ... never again will the boyish delight in hitting a ball with a piece of wood flower directly into charm and gaiety and all the wealth of achievement.

===Later career===
Against Bradman&#x27;s &quot;Invincibles&quot; in 1948, Compton was England&#x27;s standout performer in a losing cause. In the First Test at Trent Bridge he scored 184 in the second innings after Australia had established a first innings lead of 344, and it looked as though he might save the match for England until he lost his balance to a short-pitched ball from Miller and hit his wicket. In the Third Test at Old Trafford, Compton scored an unbeaten 145 in the first innings, when no other batsman made more than 37. He had scored only four runs when, while facing a bumper barrage from Ray Lindwall, he edged the ball onto his forehead. Compton was forced off the ground with a cut head, given two stitches, and ordered to rest despite wanting to return to the crease.

He eventually came back out when England was teetering at 119 for 5 and enabled the team to reach 363. This was the only match that England did not lose, and if so much time had not been lost to the weather they might have won it. In the series he made 562 runs at 62.44, against fierce fast bowling from Lindwall, Miller and Bill Johnston.

On the MCC tour of South Africa 1948–49 he scored 300 against North-Eastern Transvaal in just a minute over three hours – still the fastest triple-century ever in first-class cricket. His first hundred took 66 minutes (he said, &quot;I was getting a sight of the bowling&quot;), his second 78 minutes (he was not out overnight and had to play himself in again next morning), and his third hundred took just 37 minutes. Reminiscing about the match later, Compton compared the South Africans&#x27; bowling with a decent county side, but criticised their catching (he had been dropped before he reached 20).

He toured Australia for 1950–51 Ashes series as vice-captain, the first professional in the 20th century to be awarded the position, but had a dismal tour because of a recurring knee problem caused by an old football injury. He averaged only 7.57 in the Tests, but 92.11 in his other first-class matches. He became the first professional to captain the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) for an entire game, Jack Hobbs having taken over from the injured Arthur Carr in 1924–1925. He and Len Hutton made the winning runs in the Fifth Test at Melbourne, the first time Australia had been beaten since 1938.

Compton also jointly captained Middlesex between 1951 and 1952, with Bill Edrich. Also in 1952, Compton scored his 100th first-class century against Northampton while featuring for Middlesex at Lord&#x27;s.

On the 1954–55 tour his departure was delayed for a remedial operation on his knee and he joined the team in Australia by aeroplane. In the First Test at Brisbane he badly cut his hand when he hit a billboard while fielding and batted at the bottom of the order. He missed the Second Test. He came third in the England Test averages (38.20), but topped the tour averages (57.07) and made three centuries. In his last Test against Australia in 1956 he top-scored with 94 despite having had his right kneecap removed the previous November.

In home test series against Pakistan he set the record for scoring the most runs in between lunch and tea in a Test match (173).

Compton finished his cricket career after playing 78 Test matches with 17 centuries at an average of 50.06. In all first-class cricket he scored 123 centuries.

==Football career==
Compton also played football, beginning his career at non-league Nunhead in the 1933–34 season before joining Arsenal. While playing as a winger, he made his debut in 1936, taking up the number 11 jersey at the club. Arsenal won the league championship (old First Division) in 1937–38, but Denis Compton did not get a medal since he had made only 7 appearances that season. Compton was eventually successful with Arsenal at Highbury, winning the League title in 1948 and the FA Cup in 1950.

However, the latter part of his sporting career was dogged by injury after his right knee was damaged in a collision with the goalkeeper of Charlton Athletic. He was thus limited to 60 official, i.e. non-wartime appearances, scoring 16 goals altogether. He represented England in wartime games on twelve occasions, but never in a full official match. He also appeared in the Rovers Cup in India with a visiting British team.

==Personality and legacy==
Compton&#x27;s absent-mindedness was legendary. Colin Cowdrey writes that Compton turned up for the Old Trafford Test of 1955 against South Africa without his kitbag. Undaunted, he sauntered into the museum and, borrowing an antique bat off the display, went on to score 158 and 71. Nevertheless, England lost by three wickets. This absent-mindedness was particularly obvious in his tendency to run out his partners at the crease: Trevor Bailey declared that &quot;a call for a run from Compton should be treated as no more than a basis for negotiation&quot;. In typical form, at his brother Leslie&#x27;s benefit match in 1955, he managed to run Leslie out before he had faced a single ball.

Peter Parfitt, the Middlesex and England batsman, was a speaker at a major celebration in London for Compton&#x27;s 70th birthday. He claims that the chief guest was called to the telephone by a lady who had heard about the dinner. Eventually, he agreed to take the call. &quot;Denis,&quot; she said, &quot;it&#x27;s me, your mother. You&#x27;re not 70, you&#x27;re only 69.&quot;

After retiring from sport, Denis Compton became a journalist and later a commentator for BBC Television. He was made a CBE in 1958. He became the first former professional cricketer to be elected President of Middlesex County Cricket Club in 1991. He served two terms, until a week before his death from septicaemia in Windsor, Berkshire aged 78.

Compton&#x27;s death, on Saint George&#x27;s Day, coincided with the opening of the 1997 County Championship season, and pavilion flags across the country were lowered to half-mast in his memory.
The MCC named the twin stands at the Nursery End of Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground in his and Bill Edrich&#x27;s honour. Cricket writer Colin Bateman noted, however, that it was &quot;a dull, practical structure which does little justice to their mercurial talents and indomitable spirits&quot;.

Compton was also honoured at the Shenley Cricket Centre, where the main pitch is named the Denis Compton Oval. That is where his grandson, Nick Compton, set the Middlesex record for the 6th wicket partnership in List A cricket (142* BL Hutton &amp; NRD Compton v Lancashire at Shenley 2002).

==Commercial sponsorships==
With his contemporary the footballer Stanley Matthews, Compton was the first British sportsman to make a substantial living by exploiting his sporting reputation to provide advertisements and endorsements. For many years he was the public face of the Brylcreem range of men&#x27;s haircare products.

An example of this is illustrated upon page VIII of the Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack edition of 1955. Denis Compton developed a close working relationship with Royds Advertising, and its chairman, who at that time was Nicholas Royds.

==Personal life==
Compton&#x27;s elder brother Leslie also played cricket for Middlesex and football as a defender for Arsenal and England.

Compton was married three times. His first wife was Doris Rich, a dancer. They married at St John&#x27;s Wood on 1 March 1941 and had a son, Brian (born 2 January 1942).

With his second wife, Valerie Platt, Compton had two sons, Patrick and Richard, both of whom were born in England but brought up by their mother in South Africa after 1960. Both of them went on to play cricket for Natal.

In 1975, Compton married his third wife, Christine Franklin Tobias, with whom he had two daughters, Charlotte and Victoria. His grandson Nick, son of Richard, made his Test debut against India at Ahmedabad during the England cricket team&#x27;s 2012–13 tour of India.

==Media==
Compton is mentioned in the &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; episode &quot;The Builders.&quot; When questioning the maid Polly about who is at fault for some bungled hotel renovations, Basil sarcastically asks her, &quot;... whose fault is it then you cloth-eared bint? Denis Compton&#x27;s?&quot;

In an episode of &quot;Ever Decreasing Circles&quot; titled &quot;The Cricket Match&quot;, Martin explains to his neighbour Paul that Compton never undermined his county captain George Mann despite being the better player.

In Tim Rice&#x27;s Academy Awards acceptance speech for the song &quot;Can You Feel the Love Tonight&quot;, he thanked Compton as &quot;... a childhood hero of mine.&quot;

In the &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; episode &quot;Living Together, But Where?&quot;, Lionel wonders whether he should keep his copy of a book written by Compton.

Denis Compton appears as a mystery guest in the BBC version of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, hosted by Eamonn Andrews having aired on 5 October 1957. A very rare complete episode can be seen on YouTube.

Compton and Colin Cowdrey met Buddy Holly and The Crickets at the former &#x27;Whisky a GoGo&#x27;, at 33–37, Wardour Street, Soho, London, in April 1958, during the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll group&#x27;s British tour, and explained the game of cricket to them.

<text>Henry Herbert Stevens, (8 December 1878 – 14 June 1973) was a Canadian politician and businessman. A member of R. B. Bennett&#x27;s cabinet, he split with the Conservative Prime Minister to found the Reconstruction Party of Canada.

==Early life==
Stevens was born in Bristol, England and immigrated to Canada with his family at the age of nine. His family settled in Peterborough, Ontario where his widowed father raised him and his three brothers and sisters. The family moved to Vernon, British Columbia, in 1894 and Stevens found his first job there, as a grocery clerk, at the age of 16. He then went to northern British Columbia to work in the mining camps before working as a fireman on the Canadian Pacific Railway and later as a stagecoach driver. In 1899 he joined the United States Army, and travelled to the Philippines and then to China, where he was present during the Boxer Rebellion, before returning to British Columbia in 1901. He found work again in the grocery business and then as an accountant. Up to the time he entered politics, he was a lay preacher in his local Methodist Church and he occasionally took services in remote logging camps and schoolhouses outside Vancouver. He became active in politics after a high-profile anti-crime crusade. Vancouver was rife with opium dens, saloons and illegal gambling halls, and Stevens visited these places each night and then published the names of the establishments and what he had witnessed there in the press the next day. His campaign forced the resignation of the chief of police and won Stevens a seat on Vancouver City Council in 1910.

==Parliamentary career==
Stevens was first elected to the House of Commons in the general election of 1911 as a Conservative. He served in the short-lived Cabinets of Prime Minister Arthur Meighen in 1921 as Minister of Trade and Commerce, until the government was defeated by William Lyon Mackenzie King&#x27;s Liberals. In 1926 Stevens led an investigation into the King government&#x27;s handling of customs, which uncovered evidence of corruption that forced the resignation of King&#x27;s minority government. This was followed by Governor General Byng&#x27;s controversial decision to ask the Conservatives under Meighen to form a government rather than call an election. Stevens was appointed Minister of Customs and Excise in Meighen&#x27;s short-lived ministry.

Stevens was an opponent of Asian immigration saying, in 1914, &quot;We cannot hope to preserve the national type if we allow Asiatics to enter Canada in any numbers.&quot; He was actively involved in the Komagata Maru incident, working with the head immigration officer, Malcolm R. J. Reid, to stop the ship&#x27;s Indian passengers from coming to shore. It was Reid&#x27;s intransigence, supported by Stevens, that led to mistreatment of the passengers on the ship and to prolonging its departure date, which was not resolved until after the intervention of the federal Minister of Agriculture, Martin Burrell, MP for Yale—Cariboo.

After R.B. Bennett led the Tories to victory in the general election of 1930 he made Stevens his Minister of Trade and Commerce. In 1934 Stevens chaired the Royal Commission on Price Spreads and Mass Buying, through which he exposed abuses by big business, attacked corporate interests, accusing them of price fixing, and called for radical reform. Bennett agreed to set up a parliamentary committee in February 1934 to examine price fixing and corporate manipulation of the market. Stevens resigned from Cabinet a year later when many of the committee&#x27;s recommendations were ignored. Three cabinet ministers urged Stevens to challenge Bennett for the leadership of the party within the Conservative caucus and a total of 72 of the 137 Conservative MPs pledged to support Stevens, but he declined to challenge Bennett for the party leadership without a leadership convention.

Instead, Stevens quit the Conservatives to form the Reconstruction Party of Canada. In the federal elections of 1935 the party won nearly 400,000 votes and shattered the Tories, reducing them to a rump of only 30 seats, but Stevens was the only Reconstructionist candidate to win a seat. He subsequently crossed the floor to rejoin the Conservative Party in 1938 and was rumoured to be considering standing for party leader at the 1938 Conservative leadership convention but did not run. He ran as a Conservative candidate in Kamloops in 1940, but was defeated.

==Later life==
Stevens ran as a candidate in the 1942 Conservative leadership convention, but was eliminated on the first ballot, losing to John Bracken. He did not run in the general election of 1945, but ran again in Vancouver Centre in 1949 and again in 1953, losing both times. He was elected Chairman of the Vancouver Board of Trade in 1952. He was a member of the Orange Order.

In 1942, Stevens was elected President of the B.C. Natural Resources Conservation League.

Stevens was the last surviving member of Bennett&#x27;s cabinet when he died in 1973 at the age of 94.

<doc id="539482" wikidata="Q767112" url="?curid=539482" title="Greater coucal">
<text>The greater coucal or crow pheasant (Centropus sinensis), is a large non-parasitic member of the cuckoo order of birds, the Cuculiformes. A widespread resident in the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia, it is divided into several subspecies, some being treated as full species. They are large, crow-like with a long tail and coppery brown wings and found in a wide range of habitats from jungle to cultivation and urban gardens. They are weak fliers, and are often seen clambering about in vegetation or walking on the ground as they forage for insects, eggs and nestlings of other birds. They have a familiar deep resonant call which is associated with omens in many parts of its range.

==Description==

This is a large species of cuckoo at 48 cm. The head is black, upper mantle and underside are black glossed with purple. The back and wings are chestnut brown. There are no pale shaft streaks on the coverts. The eyes are ruby red. Juveniles are duller black with spots on the crown and there are whitish bars on the underside and tail. There are several geographic races and some of these populations are sometimes treated as full species. Earlier treatments included the brown coucal (&quot;C. (s.) andamanensis&quot;) under this name. Rasmussen &amp; Anderton (2005) suggest that the race &quot;parroti&quot; may be a full species – the southern coucal which is found in peninsular India (northern boundary unclear). The race &quot;intermedius&quot; of the Assam and Bangladesh region is smaller than the nominate race found in the sub-Himalayan zone. Songs of the races are said to vary considerably. Race &quot;parroti&quot; of southern India has a black head and the underparts glossed blue and has the forehead, face and throat more brownish. The sexes are similar in plumage but females are slightly larger.

Leucistic specimens have been observed.

===Subspecies and distribution===
The nominate race is found from the Indus Valley through the sub-Himalayan and Gangetic plains to Nepal, Assam and the Bhutan foothills into southern China (Guangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian).

* Race &quot;parroti&quot; Stresemann, 1913 is found in Peninsular India (Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and southwards). The upper back is black and the juvenile has unbarred wings.
* Race &quot;intermedius&quot; Hume, 1873 is smaller in size and found in Bangladesh, west Cachar and into Myanmar and the Chin Hills into China (Yunnan, Hainan), Thailand, Indochina and the northern part of the Malay Peninsula.
* Race &quot;bubutus&quot; Horsfield, 1821 is found in the southern part of the Malay Peninsula into the islands of Sumatra, Nias, Mentawai Islands, Java, Bali, Borneo, western Philippines (Balabac, Cagayan Sulu and Palawan). The wing is paler rufous in this race.
* Race &quot;anonymus&quot; Stresemann, 1913 is found in the southwestern Philippines (Basilan, Sulu Islands) and is shorter and darker winged than &quot;bubutus&quot;.
* Race &quot;kangeangensis&quot; Vorderman, 1893 is found in the Kangean Islands. This has pale and dark plumage phases.

The young when hatched have black skin and white hairy feathers (termed as trichoptiles) forming a fringe over the eye and beak. The centre of the belly is pinkish and the upper mandible is black with a pink edge. The iris is brown, gape yellow and feet dark brown-gray.
The juvenile of race &quot;parroti&quot; is unmarked dull black on the underside (contra barred in the northern races) and much darker, dusky chestnut on the wings. Race &quot;bubutus&quot; found in Southeast Asia has a distinct call. Individuals from the Western Ghats are very similar in size to the lesser coucal &quot;Centropus bengalensis&quot; but the latter has a stubbier bill, shorter tail, wing tips extending beyond the tertials and a chestnut wing lining, dark eyes and a tail with green/bronze sheen. Females of the race &quot;parroti&quot; develop dusky or sooty wing coverts between November and January and the northern boundary of the race is along the Punjab plains where it forms intermediates with the northern forms.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The greater coucal is a large bird which takes a wide range of insects, caterpillars, snails and small vertebrates such as the saw-scaled vipers. They are also known to eat bird eggs, nestlings, fruits and seeds. In Tamil Nadu they were found to feed predominantly on snails &quot;Helix vittata&quot;. They are also known to feed on the toxic fruits of &quot;Cascabela thevetia&quot; (Yellow Oleander). In oil palm cultivation, they have been noted as an avian pest due to their habit of eating the fleshy mesocarps of the ripe fruits.

They sunbathe in the mornings singly or in pairs on the top of vegetation with their wings spread out. The territory of a nesting pair has been found in southern India to be 0.9 to 7.2 ha (mean 3.8 ha). They are most active in the warm hours of the morning and in the late afternoon.

The calls are a booming low &quot;coop-coop-coop&quot;s repeated and with variations and some duets between individuals. When duetting the female has a lower pitched call. Other calls include a rapid rattling &quot;lotok, lotok ...&quot; and a harsh scolding &quot;skeeaaaw&quot; and a hissing threat call.

===Breeding===
The breeding season is after the monsoon in southern India but varies in other parts of its range but chiefly June to September.
Greater coucals are monogamous, and the courtship display involves chases on the ground and the male brings food gifts for the female. The female lowers her tail and droops her wings to signal acceptance. The nest is built mostly by the male over about three to eight days. The nest is a deep cup with a dome in dense vegetation inside tangles of creepers, bamboo clump or &quot;Pandanus&quot; crowns. They can be built as high as 6m above the ground and the typical clutch is 3–5 eggs. The eggs (of size 36–28 mm weighing 14.8 g ) are chalky white with a yellow glaze when laid that wears off. Both the male and the female take part in nest building. They lay 2 to 4 eggs that hatch after 15–16 days of incubation. The chicks take 18–22 days to fledge. A study in southern India found that 77% of the eggs hatched and 67% fledged. Nests with eggs were sometimes abandoned or marauded by the Indian jungle crow &quot;Corvus macrorhynchos culminatus&quot;.

Haemosporidia closely related to those that cause malaria have been found in their red blood cells. One species, &quot;Haemoproteus centropi&quot;, is described from cuckoos such as &quot;Clamator jacobinus&quot; and &quot;Centropus sinensis&quot; and is spread by mosquitoes. Immature &quot;Haemaphysalis&quot; ticks have been found feeding on greater coucals.

==In culture==
The bird is associated with many superstitions and beliefs. The deep calls are associated with spirits and omens. In Bengal, there was a belief that monocled cobras (known as &quot;keutia&quot;) had no males and that they mated with male greater coucals. 

In British India, it was noted that new-recruits to India often mistook it for a pheasant and shot it to find it &quot;evil flavoured&quot; giving it the nickname of &quot;Griff&#x27;s pheasant&quot;.

The flesh was once eaten as a folk cure for tuberculosis and pulmonary ailments.
