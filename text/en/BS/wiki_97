<text>Sophie Mirabella (née Panopoulos; born 27 October 1968) is an Australian lawyer and former politician who currently serves as a Commissioner on the Fair Work Commission since 24 May 2021. She was previously a Liberal Party member of the Australian House of Representatives from 2001 to 2013, representing the Division of Indi, Victoria.

After spending a number of years on the backbench, Mirabella moved to the position of Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Local Government after the Coalition lost government in 2007 and to the role of Spokeswoman on Early Childhood Education, Childcare, Women and Youth in 2008. In 2009, she was appointed as the Shadow Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research.

Mirabella narrowly lost her seat of Indi at the 2013 federal election to independent candidate Cathy McGowan. She also resigned from the Coalition frontbench shortly prior to conceding defeat. She subsequently attempted to regain the seat, standing again for the Liberal Party at the 2016 election, but was defeated by McGowan again on an increased margin.

==Early life and education==
Mirabella was born Sophie Panopoulos in Melbourne, Victoria, her parents having arrived in Australia from Greece in 1956. She was educated at St Catherine&#x27;s School, Toorak, while working part-time at her father&#x27;s milk bar in South Melbourne. Upon finishing secondary school, she attended the University of Melbourne where she studied law and became involved in student activism through the Melbourne University Liberal Club, of which she was president, and as vice-president of the Australian Liberal Students&#x27; Federation. After graduating from Melbourne University with degrees in law and commerce, Mirabella worked as a solicitor and articled clerk from 1995 to 1997. From 1998 until her election to Parliament she worked as a barrister.

==Political career==
Mirabella has been a member of the Liberal Party since 1987. She became well known during the constitutional monarchy/republican debate in Australia, acting as a prominent advocate for retaining the constitutional monarchy, and was an elected member of the 1998 Constitutional Convention. The referendum that followed saw all states and a majority of Australians support the retention of the constitutional monarchy over the republican model that was offered. In 2001 Mirabella won preselection as the Liberal candidate to succeed Lou Lieberman as the Member for Indi, standing against Sussan Ley, which she won in the 2001 federal election with a vote of 61.15% on a two-party preferred basis. Mirabella received a well above-average 5.6% swing to her in the 2004 federal election, giving her 66.3% of the two-party preferred vote and making safe Liberal seat.

Within the federal government, Mirabella sat in the backbench until 2007. During this time, in 2005, she attracted public attention as a key member of an informal &quot;ginger group&quot; of Liberal backbenchers. She chaired this group with Victorian Senator Mitch Fifield. The group argued for &quot;tax reform&quot; (in essence, tax cuts paid for by reductions in government spending), sparking public debate on the topic. Although Fifield stepped away from the group after budget cuts in 2005, Mirabella continued for a time as the group&#x27;s chair. While on the backbench, Mirabella took a strong stance on the prominent issue of asylum seekers, criticising a group of four fellow Liberal backbenchers, including Petro Georgiou and Judi Moylan, for opposing government policy on mandatory detention. In August 2005, she called for Muslim women to be required to remove their head dress when posing for photo identification. Mirabella was an advocate of voluntary student unionism (VSU) and strongly supported the legislation proposed by Brendan Nelson.

===In opposition===
In 2007 the Coalition lost the federal election and entered opposition. After the election, Mirabella was promoted to the role of Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Local Government under the leadership of Brendan Nelson. While serving in that role, she attracted controversy in January 2008 when she launched an attack on former Liberal Party Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, after a speech he gave at Melbourne University on &quot;the Bush Administration (reversing) 60 years of progress in establishing a law-based international system&quot;, claiming errors and &quot;either intellectual sloppiness or deliberate dishonesty&quot;, and that he tacitly supported Islamic fundamentalism, should have no influence on foreign policy, and that his stance on the war on terror has left him open to caricature as a &quot;frothing-at-the-mouth leftie&quot;. She was also one of five Liberal MPs not present in February 2008, when a motion was passed unanimously apologising to the stolen generations of indigenous children between Federation and the 1970s. She explained her decision by asserting that there had never been a formal policy in Victoria of removing children from their families and that there is no evidence for any &quot;truly stolen&quot; children, despite the fact that the first laws passed giving authorities the right to take children from their parents were passed and used in Victoria.

Mirabella was one of those who pledged their support to Malcolm Turnbull when he challenged Brendan Nelson for leadership of the Liberal Party in September 2008. She was promoted as part of the subsequent reshuffle, becoming the opposition spokeswoman on early childhood education, childcare, women and youth. Her move to the Shadow Cabinet came in 2009 after Tony Abbott defeated Turnbull in a leadership spill. She was promoted to the role of spokeswoman for innovation, industry, science and research. Mirabella had joined Abbott in resigning from the frontbench over Turnbull&#x27;s climate change policy, and her move to the Shadow Cabinet was seen as part of the rise of the social-conservative right within the party.

After the 2010 election, she held her seat with a margin of 9.9% two party preferred against Labor.

===Parliamentary style===
According to Fenella Souter in the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, Mirabella is known for her &quot;caustic, confrontational manner&quot;. Her behaviour led her to be ejected from parliament at least twice. In 2007, David Hawker expelled her for shouting at him after being warned twice to resume her seat. She defied parliamentary orders under Standing Order No. 94A and thus was removed from the House of Representatives for misconduct. In 2010, Peter Slipper expelled Mirabella from parliament for 24 hours on the eve of the vote on the carbon tax, when she &quot;refused to accept a ruling barring her from tabling an anti-carbon tax petition&quot;.

On a number of occasions her comments both inside and outside parliament attracted controversy. In 2008, Mirabella stated in parliament to Prime Minister Julia Gillard, who has no children, &quot;You won&#x27;t need his (ex-PM Kevin Rudd&#x27;s) taxpayer-funded nanny, will you?&quot; Mirabella again created controversy on 2 March 2011, when she compared Gillard to Muammar Gaddafi, claiming both were delusional. Abbott refused to condemn Mirabella, instead terming the comparison &quot;colourful&quot; and not language he would use. In 2012, she denounced fellow Liberal NSW Senator Bill Heffernan by telling him to &quot;Oh, why don&#x27;t you go and pop your Alzheimer&#x27;s pills&quot;. This was in response to Heffernan branding a fellow Liberal senator a &quot;fuckwit&quot;.

Mirabella was a frequent panellist on the ABC TV talkback show &quot;Q&amp;A&quot;. On one show in 2012 a fellow panellist (GetUp! director and unsuccessful Greens Senate candidate Simon Sheikh) had a seizure live on air, with his head falling forward on the desk. Mirabella was criticised on Twitter for not physically responding to his situation. A spokesperson for Mirabella said she was unaware it was a medical emergency. Of the panelists, only Greg Combet physically responded to the situation. Sheikh made a full recovery off camera.

Prior to the 2013 federal election, retiring independent MP Tony Windsor nominated Mirabella for &quot;the nasty prize&quot; when asked who was the person he would miss least in politics on the ABC &quot;Insiders&quot; program. &quot;She is the nastiest – I reckon if you put it to a vote to all politicians, she&#x27;d come up No.1&quot;.

===2013 federal election defeat===
Mirabella was defeated in Indi by independent candidate Cathy McGowan at the 2013 federal election. She was the only sitting Liberal member to lose her seat.

On 11 September 2013, 1003 votes were discovered to have been misreported in a transcription error three days earlier. These were for McGowan, and strengthened her slight lead in the count. On 12 September, Mirabella issued a statement that, as the result in Indi would not be known for &quot;many days&quot;, and her &quot;future in the Parliament is not assured&quot;, she had requested Prime Minister-elect Abbott not consider her for a frontbench position in the new government. Abbott was quoted in reply: &quot;I pay tribute to Sophie Mirabella and thank her for her magnanimity in ensuring the continuing vote count in Indi does not hinder formation of the new ministry.&quot;

On 18 September 2013, Mirabella conceded defeat, the same day Abbott and his government were sworn in. The final result in Indi saw Mirabella&#x27;s Liberal two-candidate preferred vote at 49.8% (−10.2), with the primary vote at 44.7% (−7.2) and the two-party preferred vote at 59.1% (+0.1).

On 17 December 2013 Mirabella was named as an appointee to the board of ASC Pty Ltd – formerly known as the Australian Submarine Corporation. Mirabella&#x27;s past shadow cabinet roles were considered relevant to the appointment. A statement read &quot;Combined with her legal background and her extensive experience working with the manufacturing industry, Mrs Mirabella will make a valuable contribution to the board&quot;. The appointment was greeted with cynicism by one journalist, describing the appointment as &quot;jobs for the girls&quot;.

===2016 federal election defeat===
In May 2015, Mirabella stated Liberal minister Scott Morrison would be the &quot;next conservative prime minister of Australia&quot;, and announced she would be contesting preselection for her former seat. In June, Mirabella secured endorsement as the Liberal candidate for the seat of Indi at the 2016 federal election.

During the lead up to the official election campaign it was reported that Mirabella &quot;very publicly pushed Ms McGowan out of the way to obstruct&quot; a photo being taken of her opponent, Cathy McGowan, with a Liberal MP, Ken Wyatt. Mirabella went on Twitter to &quot;emphatically reject reports I pushed Cathy McGowan&quot;; the editor of the &quot;Benalla Ensign&quot; stated that she confirmed the incident with four sources and defended the reporting on the basis of &quot;public interest&quot;. Mirabella denied the allegations and is reported as examining legal remedies. She stated that it was &quot;extremely disappointing that the journalist at no time sought to contact me or check the facts or seek a right of reply.&quot; She also said &quot;I am currently investigating my legal remedies and those available through the Australian Press Council&quot; and &quot;The article represents a new low and a sad return to nasty tactics from my opponents.&quot; It was reported that a witness denied that any physical altercation took place.

On 21 April 2016, Mirabella alleged that during her failed election bid in 2013, A$10 million of public funding for Wangaratta Hospital was promised by the then opposition leader, Tony Abbott. She also alleged that, due to her eventual election loss to independent candidate Cathy McGowan, this funding was scrapped by the newly elected coalition government. Mirabella claimed that her own party was the source of a series of damaging leaks to undermine her.

Mirabella&#x27;s bid to reclaim the seat of Indi was ultimately unsuccessful, with Independent Cathy McGowan claiming victory in the race, with a near 4.5% swing against Mirabella after preferences. Mirabella&#x27;s first preference vote suffered a drop in excess of 17%, largely due to the Nationals Party fielding a candidate in Indi.

McGowan retained Indi against Mirabella at the 2016 election with an increased 54.8% (+4.6) two-candidate-preferred vote. The Liberal two-party-preferred vote was reduced to 54.4% (–4.7) against Labor&#x27;s 45.6% (+4.7), a marginal two-party result not seen since the 1929 election.

==Post-politics==
In August 2016, Mirabella became the general manager of government and media relations for Gina Rinehart&#x27;s company Hancock Prospecting. In 2021, Mirabella was appointed a Commissioner to the Fair Work Commission. She commenced in that role on 24 May 2021.

==Personal life==
In 1995, Mirabella began a live-in relationship with Colin Howard, then dean of law at Melbourne University, who was forty years her senior. The relationship ended in 2001, although they remained close until his death in 2011. Mirabella held power of attorney over Howard&#x27;s affairs from early 2007, and he was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s in the following year. Pursuant to his 1997 will, Mirabella was executor and sole beneficiary of his estate following his death in 2011. Howard&#x27;s adult children threatened &quot;a bitter legal dispute&quot; over the will, but there was no legal challenge mounted to either its veracity or validity.

In June 2006, she married Greg Mirabella, a farmer and former Australian Army Reserve officer working in the defence industry, and later a senator for Victoria. The couple have two daughters.

<doc id="560870" wikidata="Q378344" url="?curid=560870" title="Wilfred Grenfell">
<text>Sir Wilfred Thomason Grenfell (28 February 1865 – 9 October 1940) was a British medical missionary to Newfoundland, who wrote books on his work and other topics.

==Early life and education==
He was born at Parkgate, Cheshire, England, on 28 February 1865, the Son of Rev. Algernon Sidney Grenfell, headmaster of Mostyn House School, and Jane Georgiana Hutchison.

Grenfell moved to London in 1882. He then commenced the study of medicine at the London Hospital Medical College (now part of Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry) under the tutelage of Sir Frederick Treves. He graduated in 1888.

==Career==
The Royal National Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen sent Grenfell to Newfoundland in 1892 to improve the plight of coastal inhabitants and fishermen. That mission began in earnest in 1892 when he recruited two nurses and two doctors for hospitals at Indian Harbour, Labrador and later opened cottage hospitals along the coast of Labrador. The mission expanded greatly from its initial mandate to one of developing schools, an orphanage, cooperatives, industrial work projects, and social work. Although founded to serve the local area, the mission developed to include the aboriginal peoples and settlers along the coasts of Labrador and the eastern side of the Great Northern Peninsula of western Newfoundland. One of the children Grenfell assisted was an Inuit girl, Kirkina, for whom he helped secure artificial limbs and later the Grenfell Mission educated her in nursing and midwifery.

In 1907, Grenfell imported a group of 300 reindeer from Norway to provide food and serve as draft animals in Newfoundland. Unbeknownst to him, some of the animals carried a parasitic roundworm, &quot;Elaphostrongylus rangiferi&quot;, that then spread to native caribou herds. The reindeer herd eventually disappeared; however, the parasite took hold and causes cerebrospinal elaphostrongylosis (CSE) in caribou, a disease well known in reindeer in Scandinavia.

In 1908, Grenfell was on his way with his dogs to a Newfoundland village for a medical emergency when he got caught in , from which he managed to get onto an ice-pan with the dogs. He was forced to sacrifice some of his dogs to make a warm, fur coat for himself. After drifting for several days without food or fresh water, he was rescued by some villagers in the area. Because of this experience he buried the dogs and put up a plaque saying, &quot;Who gave their lives for me.&quot;

By 1914 the mission had gained international status. In order to manage its property and affairs, the International Grenfell Association, a non-profit mission society, was founded to support Grenfell&#x27;s work. The Association operated until 1981, as an NGO. It had responsibility for delivery of healthcare and social services in northern Newfoundland and Labrador. After 1981 a governmental agency, The Grenfell Regional Health Services Board took over the operational responsibility. The International Grenfell Association, having divested itself of all properties and operational responsibility for health and social services, boarding schools and hospitals then became a supporting association making grants and funding scholarships for medical training.

For his years of service on behalf of the people of these communities he was later knighted by the King in 1927.

In 1931, Grenfell had a small speaking role in the film, The Viking, in which he narrated the film&#x27;s prologue and gave a brief statement of the tragic circumstances involving the film&#x27;s production. During the production of the film, which was filmed on location in Newfoundland, producer Varick Frissell felt that the film needed more action sequences and set out on the ice floes to film them. During filming, the ship, SS &quot;Viking&quot; on which filming was taking place, exploded, killing Frissell and 27 others.

== Personal life ==
He married Anne Elizabeth Caldwell MacClanahan (died 1938) of Chicago, Illinois, in 1909. They had two children and retired to Vermont after his work in Newfoundland. They were married in 1909 and came to live in the Grenfell House (which they designed together) in St. Anthony, Newfoundland. Anne gave Dr. Grenfell&#x27;s life comfort and refinement. She became totally involved in his work. She organized his fundraising tours and lectures, edited his books and helped secure scholarships for the children of the area to continue their education. Although Anne was ill towards the end of her life, she kept her pain hidden from her husband and took care of him until she died in 1938.

==Death and legacy==
Grenfell died of a coronary thrombosis at Kinloch House in Charlotte, Vermont on 9 October 1940. His ashes were brought to St Anthony, where they were placed inside a rock face overlooking the harbour.
The Sir Wilfred Thomason Grenfell Historical Society was formed in 1978. The society purchased Grenfell&#x27;s home in St. Anthony, Newfoundland and Labrador. The home has been restored as a museum and archives. The Sir Wilfred Thomason Grenfell Historical Society with the support of Provincial Government and the International Grenfell Association began construction of an interpretation centre in St. Anthony and it was opened in 1997. This facility added to the existing house and serves to promote the legacy to thousands of visitors each year. The Grenfell Interpretation Centre also is used by other organizations for meetings and events. A large interpretive display is housed there and provides historical background surrounding the work of Sir Wilfred Thomason Grenfell.

In 1979, Memorial University&#x27;s West Coast Regional College was renamed to honour Grenfell.

Grenfell is honoured with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) on 9 October.

===Literary inspiration===
A unique figure, Grenfell served to inspire at least two characters in Canadian literature: Dr. Luke in Norman Duncan&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Luke of the Labrador&quot; (1904) and Dr. Tocsin in &quot;White Eskimo&quot; by Harold Horwood (1972).

A biography for children (middle-high school) was written in 1942, by Genevieve Fox. Published by Thomas Y. Crowell Co. The book had second and third printings as well.

The following statement has been widely ascribed to him, but cannot be found in any of his books: &quot;The service we render to others is really the rent we pay for our room on this earth. It is obvious that man is himself a traveler; that the purpose of this world is not &#x27;to have and to hold&#x27; but &#x27;to give and serve.&#x27; There can be no other meaning.&quot;

===Fabric===
Mill owner Walter Haythornthwaite of Burnley, Lancashire created a cloth for Sir Wilfred Grenfell after attending a Grenfell lecture. Designed to withstand the conditions of the Labrador coast, it is a 600 thread-per-inch woven cotton gabardine that became known as &#x27;Grenfell Cloth&#x27; from 1923. The cloth became the signature fabric of the Grenfell Clothing brand which is, to this day, manufactured in the United Kingdom.

<doc id="560872" wikidata="Q5144758" url="?curid=560872" title="Colfax massacre">
<text>The Colfax massacre, sometimes referred to as the Colfax riot, occurred on Easter Sunday, April 13, 1873, in Colfax, Louisiana, the parish seat of Grant Parish. An estimated 62–153 Black men were murdered while surrendering to a mob of former Confederate soldiers and members of the Ku Klux Klan. Three White men also died during the confrontation.

After the contested 1872 election for governor of Louisiana and local offices, a group of White men armed with rifles and a small cannon overpowered Black freedmen and state militia occupying the Grant Parish courthouse in Colfax. Most of the freedmen were killed after surrendering, and nearly another 50 were killed later that night after being held as prisoners for several hours. Estimates of the number of dead have varied over the years, ranging from 62 to 153; three Whites died but the number of Black victims was difficult to determine because many bodies were thrown into the Red River or removed for burial, possibly at mass graves.

Historian Eric Foner described the massacre as the worst instance of racial violence during Reconstruction. In Louisiana, it had the most fatalities of any of the numerous violent events occurring after the disputed gubernatorial contest in 1872 between Republicans and Democrats. Foner wrote, &quot;...every election [in Louisiana] between 1868 and 1876 was marked by rampant violence and pervasive fraud&quot;. Although the Fusionist-dominated state &quot;returning board,&quot; which ruled on vote validity, initially declared John McEnery and his Democratic slate the winners, the board eventually divided, with a faction declaring Republican William P. Kellogg the victor. A Republican federal judge in New Orleans ruled that the Republican-majority legislature be seated.

Federal prosecution and conviction of a few perpetrators at Colfax by the Enforcement Acts was appealed to the Supreme Court. In a major case, the court ruled in &quot;United States v. Cruikshank&quot; (1876) that protections of the Fourteenth Amendment did not apply to persons acting individually, but only to the actions of state governments. After this ruling, the federal government could no longer use the Enforcement Act of 1870 to prosecute actions by paramilitary groups such as the White League, which had chapters forming across Louisiana beginning in 1874. Intimidation, murders, and Black voter suppression by such paramilitary groups were instrumental to the Democratic Party regaining political control of the state legislature by the late 1870s.

During the late 20th and early 21st centuries, historians have given renewed attention to the events at Colfax and the resulting Supreme Court case.

==State and national background==
In March 1865, Unionist planter James Madison Wells became governor. As the Democratic-dominated legislature passed Black Codes that restricted rights of freedmen, Wells began to favor allowing Black people to vote and temporarily disenfranchising ex-Confederates. To accomplish this, he scheduled a new constitutional convention for July 30, 1866.

It was postponed because of the New Orleans massacre that day, in which armed Southern White Democrats attacked Black Americans who had a parade in support of the convention. Anticipating trouble, the mayor of New Orleans had asked the local military commander to police the city and protect the convention. The US Army failed to respond promptly to the mayor&#x27;s request and a group of White residents attacked numerous unarmed Black residents, resulting in 38 deaths, 34 Black and four White, and more than 40 wounded, most of them Black folks.

When President Andrew Johnson blamed the massacre on Republican agitation, a popular national reaction against Johnson&#x27;s policies resulting in national voters electing a majority Republican Congress in 1866. It passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866 despite Andrew Johnson&#x27;s veto. Earlier, the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau and the occupation armies had prevented Southern Black Codes, which had limited the rights of freedmen and other Black people (including their choices of work and living locations), from becoming effective. On July 16, 1866, Congress extended the life of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, also despite Johnson&#x27;s veto. On March 2, 1867, they passed the Reconstruction Act, over Johnson&#x27;s veto, which required that Black men be given the franchise—in Southern states but not in Northern states—and that reconstructed Southern states ratify the Fourteenth Amendment before admission to the Union.

By April 1868, a biracial coalition in Louisiana had elected a Republican-majority state legislature, but violence increased before the fall election. Almost all of the victims were Black and some White Republicans who were protecting the Black Republican freedmen. Insurgents also attacked people physically or burned their homes to discourage them from voting. President Johnson, a Democrat, prevented the Republican governor of Louisiana from using either the state militia or US forces to suppress the insurgent groups, such as the Knights of the White Camelia.

==Background in Grant Parish==
The Red River area of Winn and Rapides parishes was a combination of large plantations and subsistence farmers; before the war, African Americans had worked as slaves on the plantations. William Smith Calhoun, a major planter, had inherited a plantation in the area. A former slaveholder, he lived with a mixed-race woman as his common-law wife and had come to favor Black political equality, encouraging the political organization of the local African American-based Republican party.

On election day in November 1868, Calhoun led a group of freedmen to vote. The ballot box was originally at a store owned by John Hooe, who had threatened to whip freedmen &quot;if they voted Republican&quot;. Calhoun arranged for the ballot box to be moved to a plantation store owned by a Republican. In addition, he oversaw the submission of 150 Black votes from freedmen on his plantation land. The Republicans received 318 votes, and the Democrats received 49. A group of Whites threw the ballot box into the Red River, and Democrats arrested Calhoun, alleging election fraud. With the original ballot box gone, Democrat Michael Ryan went on to claim a landslide victory.

The election was also marked by violence. Election commissioner Hal Frazier, a Black Republican, was murdered by Whites. After this, Calhoun drafted a bill to create a new parish out of parts of Winn and Rapides parishes, which passed the Republican legislature; as a major planter, Calhoun thought he would have more political influence in the new parish, which had a Black majority. Other new parishes were created by the Republican state legislature to try to develop areas of Republican political control.

==Enforcement against the Klan==
According to Lane, after Ulysses S. Grant became President in 1869, he &quot;lobbied hard for the Fifteenth Amendment&quot; (ratified February 3, 1870), which guaranteed that Black men, most of whom were newly freed slaves, would have the right to vote. However, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) continued violent attacks and killed scores of Black residents in Arkansas, South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi and elsewhere. In response, on May 31, 1870, Congress passed an Enforcement Act which prohibited groups of people from banding together to violate citizens&#x27; constitutional rights. Soon afterwards on April 20, 1871, Congress passed the Ku Klux Klan Act, which Grant used to suspend the writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; and sent federal troops to South Carolina, a state with particularly egregious Klan activity.

==Louisiana and Grant Parish==
Governor Henry Clay Warmoth struggled to maintain political balance in Louisiana. Among his appointments, he installed William Ward, a Black Union veteran, as commanding officer of Company A, 6th Infantry Regiment, Louisiana State Militia, a new unit to be based in Grant Parish to help control the violence there and in other Red River parishes. Ward, born a slave in 1840 in Charleston, South Carolina, had learned to read and write as a valet to a master in Richmond, Virginia. In 1864 he escaped and went to Fortress Monroe, where he joined the Union Army and served until after General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s surrender. About 1870 he came to Grant Parish, where he had a friend. He quickly became active among local Black Republican Party members. After his appointment to the militia, Ward recruited other freedmen for his forces, several of whom were veterans of the war.

==Louisiana election of 1872==
In Louisiana, Republican governor Henry Clay Warmoth defected to the Liberal Republicans (a group that opposed President Grant&#x27;s Reconstruction policies) in 1872. Warmoth previously supported a constitutional amendment that allowed former Confederates, who had been denied the right to vote, to be re-enfranchised. A &quot;Fusionist&quot; coalition of Liberal Republicans and Democrats nominated ex-Confederate battalion commander and Democrat John McEnery to succeed him as governor. In return, Democrats and Liberal Republicans were to send Warmoth to Washington as a US Senator. Opposing McEnery was Republican William Pitt Kellogg, one of Louisiana&#x27;s US Senators. Voting on November 4, 1872, resulted in dual governments, as a Fusionist (Liberal Republicans and Democrat)-dominated returning board declared McEnery the winner while a faction of the board proclaimed Kellogg the winner. Both administrations held inaugural ceremonies and certified their lists of local candidates.

After failing to win their case in state court, the Kellogg forces appealed to federal judge Edward Durell in New Orleans to intervene and order that Kellogg and the Stalwart Republican-majority legislature were to be seated, and for Grant to authorize US Army troops to protect Kellogg&#x27;s government. This action was widely criticized across the nation by Democrats and both factions of the Republican Party because it was considered to be a violation of the rights of states to manage their own (non-federal-office) elections. Thus, investigating committees of both chambers of the federal Congress in Washington were critical of the Kellogg choice. The House majority ruled Durell&#x27;s action illegal and the Senate majority concluded that the Kellogg regime was &quot;not much better than a successful conspiracy&quot;. In 1874 a House investigating committee in Washington recommended that Judge Durell be impeached for corruption and illegally interfering in the Louisiana 1872 state elections, but the judge resigned in order to avoid impeachment.

McEnery&#x27;s faction tried to take control of the state arsenal at Jackson Square, but Kellogg had the state militia seize dozens of leaders of McEnery&#x27;s faction and control New Orleans, where the state government was located. McEnery returned to try to take control with a private paramilitary group. In September 1873 his forces, more than 8,000 strong, entered the city and defeated the city/state militia of about 3500 in New Orleans. The Democrats took control of the state house, armory and police stations, where the state government was then located, in what was known as the Battle of Jackson Square. His forces held those buildings for three days before retreating before Federal troops arrived. Warmoth was subsequently impeached by the state legislature due to a bribery scandal resulting from his actions in the 1872 election.

Warmoth appointed Democrats as parish registrars, and they ensured the voter rolls included as many Whites and as few freedmen as possible. A number of registrars changed the registration site without notifying Black residents. They also required Black voters to prove they were over 21, while knowing that former slaves did not have birth certificates. In Grant Parish, one plantation owner threatened to expel Black people from homes they rented on his land if they voted Republican. Fusionists also tampered with ballot boxes on election day. One was found with a hole in it, apparently used for stuffing the ballot box. As a result, Grant Parish Fusionists claimed a landslide victory, even though Black voters outnumbered Whites by 776 to 630.

Warmoth issued commissions to Fusionist Democrats Alphonse Cazabat and Christopher Columbus Nash, elected parish judge and sheriff, respectively. Like many White men in the South, Nash was a Confederate veteran (as an officer, he had been held for a year and a half as a prisoner of war at Johnson&#x27;s Island in Ohio). Cazabat and Nash took their oaths of office in the Colfax courthouse on January 2, 1873. They dispatched the documents to Governor McEnery in New Orleans.

William Pitt Kellogg issued commissions to the Republican slate for Grant Parish on January 17 and 18. By then Nash and Cazabat controlled the small, primitive courthouse. Republican Robert C. Register insisted that he, not Alphonse Cazabat, was the parish judge and that Republican Daniel Wesley Shaw, not Nash, was to be the sheriff. On the night of March 25, the Republicans seized the empty courthouse and took their oaths of office. They sent their oaths to the Kellogg administration in New Orleans.

Grant Parish was one of a number of new parishes created by the Republican government in an effort to increase local control in the state. Both the land and its people were originally associated with the Calhoun family, whose plantation had covered more than the borders of the new parish. The freedmen had been slaves of the plantation. The parish also included the less-developed hill country. The total population had a narrow majority of 2400 freedmen, who mostly voted Republican, and 2200 Whites, who voted as Democrats. Statewide political tensions were represented in the rumors going around each community, often about White fears of attacks or outrage from Black people, which added to local tensions.

==Colfax courthouse conflict==
Fearful that the Democrats might try to control the local parish government, Black people started to create trenches around the courthouse and drilled to keep alert. The Republican officeholders stayed there overnight. They held the town for three weeks.

On March 28, Nash, Cazabat, Hadnot, and other White Fusionists called for armed Whites to retake the courthouse on April 1. Whites were recruited from nearby Winn and surrounding parishes to join their effort. The Republicans Shaw, Register, and Flowers and others began to recruit armed Black men to defend the courthouse.

Black Republicans Lewis Meekins and state militia captain William Ward, a Black Union veteran, raided the homes of the opposition leaders: Judge William R. Rutland, Bill Cruikshank, and Jim Hadnot. Gunfire erupted between White and Black militias on April 2 and again on April 5, but the shotguns were too inaccurate to do any harm. The two sides arranged for peace negotiations. Peace ended when a White man shot and killed a Black bystander named Jesse McKinney. Another armed conflict on April 6 ended with the White militia fleeing from armed Black militia. With the threat of violence in the community, Black women and children joined the men at the courthouse for protection.

William Ward, the commanding officer of Company A, 6th Infantry Regiment, Louisiana State Militia, headquartered in Grant Parish, had been elected state representative from the parish on the Republican ticket. He wrote to Governor Kellogg seeking US troops for reinforcement and gave the letter to William Smith Calhoun for delivery. Calhoun took the steamboat &quot;LaBelle&quot; down the Red River but was captured by Paul Hooe, Hadnot, and Cruikshank. They ordered Calhoun to tell the Black community members to leave the courthouse.

The Black defenders refused to leave although threatened by parties of armed Whites commanded by Nash. To recruit men during the rising political tensions, Nash had contributed to lurid rumors that Black men were preparing to kill all the White men and take the White women as their own. On April 8 the anti-Republican &quot;Daily Picayune&quot; newspaper of New Orleans inflamed tensions and distorted events by the following headline:

Such news attracted more Whites from the region to Grant Parish to join Nash; all were experienced Confederate veterans. They acquired a four-pound cannon that could fire iron slugs. As the Klansman Dave Paul said, &quot;Boys, this is a struggle for White supremacy.&quot;

Suffering from tuberculosis and rheumatism, on April 11 the militia captain Ward took a steamboat downriver to New Orleans to seek armed help directly from Kellogg. He was not there for the following events.

==Massacre==
Cazabat had directed Nash as sheriff to end what he called a riot. Nash gathered an armed White paramilitary group and veteran officers from Rapides, Winn and Catahoula parishes. He did not move his forces toward the courthouse until noon on Easter Sunday, April 13. Nash commanded more than 300 armed White men, most on horseback and armed with rifles. Nash reportedly ordered the defenders of the courthouse to leave. When that failed, Nash gave women and children camped outside the courthouse thirty minutes to leave. After they left, the shooting began. The fighting continued for several hours with few casualties. When Nash&#x27;s paramilitary maneuvered the cannon behind the building, some of the defenders panicked and left the courthouse.

About 60 defenders ran into nearby woods and jumped into the river. Nash sent men on horseback after the fleeing Black Republicans, and his paramilitary group killed most of them on the spot. Soon Nash&#x27;s forces directed a Black captive to set the courthouse roof afire. The defenders displayed white flags for surrender: one made from a shirt, the other from a page of a book. The shooting stopped.

Nash&#x27;s group approached and called for those surrendering to throw down their weapons and come outside. What happened next is disputed. According to the reports of some Whites, James Hadnot was shot and wounded by someone from the courthouse. &quot;In the Negro version, the men in the courthouse were stacking their guns when the White men approached, and Hadnot was shot from behind by an overexcited member of his own force.&quot; Hadnot died later, after being taken downstream by a passing steamboat.

In the aftermath of Hadnot&#x27;s shooting, the White paramilitary group reacted with mass murders of the Black men. As more than 40 times as many Black people died as did White people, historians generally describe the event as a massacre. The White paramilitary group killed unarmed men trying to hide in the courthouse. They rode down and killed those attempting to flee. They dumped some bodies into the Red River. About 50 Blacks survived the afternoon and were taken prisoner. Later that night they were summarily killed by their captors, who had been drinking alcohol. Only one Black man from the group, Levi Nelson, survived. He was shot by Cruikshank but managed to crawl away unnoticed. He later served as one of the Federal government&#x27;s chief witnesses against those who were indicted for the attacks.

Kellogg sent state militia colonels Theodore DeKlyne and William Wright to Colfax with warrants to arrest 50 White men and to install a new, compromise slate of parish officers. DeKlyne and Wright found the smoking ruins of the courthouse at Colfax, and many bodies of men who had been shot in the back of the head or the neck. They described that one body was charred, another man&#x27;s head beaten beyond recognition, and another had a slashed throat. Surviving Blacks told DeKlyne and Wright that Blacks dug a trench around the courthouse to protect it from what they saw as an attempt by White Democrats to steal an election. They were attacked by Whites armed with rifles, revolvers and a small cannon. When Blacks refused to leave, the courthouse was burned, and the Black defenders were shot down. While the Whites accused Blacks of violating a flag of truce and rioting, Black Republicans said that none of this was true. They accused Whites of marching captured prisoners away in pairs and shooting them in the back of the head.

On April 14, some of Governor Kellogg&#x27;s new police force arrived from New Orleans. Several days later, two companies of Federal troops arrived. They searched for White paramilitary members, but many had already fled to Texas or the hills. The officers filed a military report in which they identified by name three Whites and 105 Blacks who had died, plus noted they had recovered 15–20 unidentified Blacks from the river. They also noted the savage nature of many of the killings, suggesting an out-of-control situation.

The exact number of dead was never established: two US Marshals, who visited the site on April 15 and buried dead, reported 62 fatalities; a military report to Congress in 1875 identified 81 Black men by name who had been killed, and also estimated that between 15 and 20 bodies had been thrown into the Red River, and another 18 were secretly buried, for a grand total of &quot;at least 105&quot;; a state historical marker from 1950 noted fatalities as three Whites and 150 Blacks.

The historian Eric Foner, a specialist in the Civil War and Reconstruction, wrote about the event:

&quot;The organization against them is too strong. ...&quot; Louisiana Black teacher and Reconstruction legislator John G. Lewis later remarked. &quot;They attempted [armed self-defense] in Colfax. The result was that on Easter Sunday of 1873 when the sun went down that night, it went down on the corpses of two hundred and eighty negroes.&quot;

==Aftermath==
James Roswell Beckwith, the US Attorney based in New Orleans, sent an urgent telegram about the massacre to the US Attorney General. The massacre in Colfax gained headlines of national newspapers from Boston to Chicago. Various government forces spent weeks trying to round up members of the White paramilitaries, and a total of 97 men were indicted. In the end, Beckwith charged nine men and brought them to trial for violations of the Enforcement Act of 1870. It had been designed to provide federal protection for civil rights of freedmen by the Fourteenth Amendment against actions by terrorist groups such as the Klan.

The men were charged with one murder, and charges related to a conspiracy against the rights of freedmen. There were two succeeding trials in 1874. William Burnham Woods presided over the first trial and was sympathetic to the prosecution. Had the men been convicted, they would not have been able to appeal their decision to any appellate court according to the laws of the time. However, Beckwith was unable to secure a conviction—one man was acquitted, and a mistrial was declared in the cases of the other eight.

In the second trial, three men were found guilty of sixteen charges. However, the presiding judge, Joseph Bradley of the United States Supreme Court (riding circuit), dismissed the convictions, ruling that the charges violated the state actor doctrine, failed to prove a racial rationale for the massacre, or were void for vagueness. &quot;Sua sponte&quot;, he ordered that the men be released on bail, and they promptly disappeared.

When the federal government appealed the case, it was heard by the US Supreme Court as &quot;United States v. Cruikshank&quot; (1875). The Supreme Court ruled that the Enforcement Act of 1870 (which was based on the Bill of Rights and 14th Amendment) applied only to actions committed by the state and that it did not apply to actions committed by individuals or private conspiracies (&quot;See,&quot; Morrison Remick Waite). This meant that the Federal government could not prosecute cases such as the Colfax killings. The court said plaintiffs who believed their rights were abridged had to seek protection from the state. Louisiana did not prosecute any of the perpetrators of the Colfax massacre; most southern states would not prosecute White men for attacks against freedmen. Thus, enforcement of criminal sanctions under the act ended.

The publicity about the Colfax massacre and subsequent Supreme Court ruling encouraged the growth of White paramilitary organizations. In May 1874, Nash formed the first chapter of the White League from his paramilitary group, and chapters soon were formed in other areas of Louisiana, as well as the southern parts of nearby states. Unlike the former KKK, they operated openly and often curried publicity. One historian described them as &quot;the military arm of the Democratic Party.&quot; Other paramilitary groups such as the Red Shirts also arose, especially in South Carolina and Mississippi, which also had Black majorities of population, and in certain counties in North Carolina.

Paramilitary groups used violence and murder to terrorize leaders among the freedmen and White Republicans, as well as to repress voting among freedmen during the 1870s. Black American citizens had little recourse. In August 1874, for instance, the White League threw out Republican officeholders in Coushatta, Red River Parish, assassinating the six Whites before they left the state, and killing five to 15 freedmen who were witnesses. Four of the White men killed were related to the state representative from the area. Such violence served to intimidate voters and officeholders; it was one of the methods that White Democrats used to gain control of the state legislature in the 1876 elections and ultimately to end Reconstruction in Louisiana.

==Remembrances==
In Louisiana as well as in the rest of the United States, the scale of the massacre and the political conflict which it represents are significant in relation to the history of Reconstruction, the history of racism against African Americans and the history of racism in the United States.

In 1920, a committee met in Colfax to purchase a monument to memorialize the three White men who died. This monument stands in the Colfax Cemetery and it reads &quot;Erected to the memory of the Heroes, /
Stephen Decatur Parish / James West Hadnot / Sidney Harris / Who fell in the Colfax Riot fighting for White Supremacy.&quot;

In 1950, Louisiana erected a state highway marker which read that the event of 1873 was &quot;the Colfax Riot,&quot; as the event was traditionally known in the White community. The marker states, &quot;On this site occurred the Colfax Riot, in which three white men and 150 negroes were slain. This event on April 13, 1873, marked the end of carpetbag misrule in the South.&quot; The marker was removed on May 15, 2021, for eventual placement in a museum. On April 13, 2023, the 150th anniversary of the Colfax massacre, the removed marker was replaced by a seven-foot granite monument that lists 57 Black people confirmed to have been killed in the massacre and has artwork about the experience of Black people during Reconstruction.

==Renewed attention==
The Colfax massacre is one of the events of Reconstruction and late 19th-century American history which have received renewed national attention during the early 21st century, as much attention as the 1923 massacre in Rosewood, Florida received near the end of the 20th century. In 2007 and 2008, two new books about the topic were published: Leeanna Keith&#x27;s &quot;The Colfax Massacre: The Untold Story of Black Power, White Terror, and the Death of Reconstruction&quot;, and Charles Lane&#x27;s &quot;The Day Freedom Died: The Colfax Massacre, the Supreme Court, and the Betrayal of Reconstruction.&quot; In his book, Lane addressed the political and legal implications of the Supreme Court case, which were derived from the prosecution of several men who were member of the White paramilitary groups. In addition, a film documentary is in preparation.

In 2007, the Red River Heritage Association, Inc. was formed as a group which intended to construct a museum in Colfax, collect materials and store them in the museum, and interpret the history of Reconstruction in Louisiana, especially in the Red River area.

In 2008, on the 135th anniversary of the Colfax massacre, an interracial group commemorated the event. It laid flowers on the place where some of the victims had fallen and it also held a forum in an attempt to discuss the history of the massacre.

In 2021, a state highway marker which had been erected in Louisiana in 1950 was removed, the marker read that the event of 1873 was &quot;the Colfax Riot,&quot; as the event was traditionally known in the White community. The marker states, &quot;On this site occurred the Colfax Riot, in which three white men and 150 negroes were slain. This event on April 13, 1873, marked the end of carpetbag misrule in the South.&quot; The marker was removed on May 15, 2021, for eventual placement in a museum. On April 13, 2023, the 150th anniversary of the Colfax massacre, the removed marker was replaced by a seven-foot granite monument that lists 57 Black people confirmed to have been killed in the massacre and has artwork about the experience of Black people during Reconstruction.

<text>Jules Alfred Huot de Goncourt (; 17 December 183020 June 1870) was a French writer, who published books together with his brother Edmond. Jules was born and died in Paris. His death at the age of 39 was at Auteuil of a stroke brought on by syphilis.

The Prix Goncourt is awarded annually in his honor.

==Biography==
===Background===
Jules de Goncourt was born in Paris, the fourth child of a former cavalry officer and squadron leader in the Grande Armée of Napoléon I, Marc-Pierre Huot de Goncourt, and his wife Annette-Cécile de Goncourt (née Guérin). Between Jules and his older brother Edmond were born two sisters who died at young ages, Nephtalie (1824–1825) and Émilie (1829–1832).
Jules&#x27; paternal grandfather, Huot de Goncourt, sat as a deputy in the National Assembly of 1789. At the Lycée Condorcet, which he attended from 1842 to 1848, he was a strong student, obtaining two &quot;accessits&quot; in Greek and Latin in the Concours général. Both parents died while their sons were still young; after their mothers&#x27; death in 1848, Jules and Edmond inherited a legacy which gave them financial independence and allowed them to pursue their artistic interests.

===Career===
The two brothers initially focused on art history scholarship, publishing books on late 18th century history and the &quot;evolution of an age from the objects and articles of its social existence&quot;. The two brothers shared a love for 18th century art, assembling a large and esteemed collection of fine and decorative art from the period, as well as ephemera like letters, drawings, and prints. From 1856, Jules and Edmond published a series of essays called &quot;L&#x27;Art du XVIIIe Siècle&quot; (The Art of the 18th Century), which came to encompass 12 fascicles and was not finished until 1875. In the 1860s the brothers published novels characterized by Naturalism and an examination of the different social classes, which anticipates the work of later authors like Émile Zola and George Moore. &quot;Germinie Lacerteux&quot; (1864) is &quot;one of the first realistic French novels of working class life&quot; and was based on the life of the brother&#x27;s housekeeper Rose, who stole from them to fund a secret life of orgies and sexual encounters. In 1862, Jules was imprisoned for several days in the &quot;Hôtel des Haricots&quot; for refusing to serve in the National Guard. In 1868, the brothers moved to the Villa Montmorency in the Parisian suburb of Auteuil. The house became something of a tourist attraction because of the brothers&#x27; collections, with newspapers publishing articles about it and strangers writing for permission to visit.

After Jules&#x27;s death in 1870, Edmond finished their uncompleted collaborations, including studies of three of Louis XV&#x27;s mistresses (Madame de Pompadour, Madame du Barry, and the Duchess of Châteauroux) and a monograph on the artist Paul Gavarni. In 1885 Edmond published a selection of Jules&#x27;s letters. He also continued the &quot;Journal&quot;, which the two brothers had begun in 1851, continuing it until his own death in 1896. From 1887 to 1896, Edmond published nine volumes of the journal.

Jules de Goncourt is buried with his brother Edmond in the Cimetière de Montmartre.

<text>The pharmaceutical industry is a medical industry that discovers, develops, produces, and markets pharmaceutical goods such as medications and medical devices. Medications are then administered to (or self-administered by) patients for curing or preventing disease or to alleviate symptoms of illness or injury. 

Pharmaceutical companies may deal in generic drugs, branded drugs, or both, within different contexts. Generic materials are without the involvement of intellectual property, whereas branded materials are protected by chemical patents. The industry&#x27;s various subdivisions include distinct areas, such as manufacturing biologics or total synthesis. The industry is subject to a variety of laws and regulations that govern the patenting, efficacy testing, safety evaluation, and marketing of these drugs. The global pharmaceutical market produced treatments worth a total of $1,228.45 billion in 2020. The sector showed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.8% in 2021, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In historical terms, the pharmaceutical industry, as an intellectual concept, arose in the middle to late 1800s in nation-states with developed economies such as Germany, Switzerland, and the United States. Some businesses engaging in synthetic organic chemistry, such as several firms generating dyestuffs derived from coal tar on a large scale, were seeking out new applications for their artificial materials in terms of human health. This trend of increased capital investment occurred in tandem with the scholarly study of pathology as a field advancing significantly, and a variety of businesses set up cooperative relationships with academic laboratories evaluating human injury and disease. Examples of industrial companies with a pharmaceutical focus that have endured to this day after such distant beginnings include Bayer (based out of Germany) and Pfizer (based out of the U.S.).

==History==
===Mid-1800s–1945===

The modern era of the pharmaceutical industry began with local apothecaries that expanded their traditional role of distributing botanical drugs such as morphine and quinine to wholesale manufacture in the mid-1800s. Intentional drug discovery from plants began with the extraction of morphine – an analgesic and sleep-inducing agent – from opium by the German apothecary assistant Friedrich Sertürner somewhere between 1803 and 1805. Sertürner later named this compound after the Greek god of dreams, Morpheus. Multinational corporations including Merck, Hoffman-La Roche, Burroughs-Wellcome (now part of GSK), Abbott Laboratories, Eli Lilly, and Upjohn (now part of Pfizer) began as local apothecary shops in the mid-1800s. By the late 1880s, German dye manufacturers had perfected the purification of individual organic compounds from tar and other mineral sources and had also established rudimentary methods in organic chemical synthesis. The development of synthetic chemical methods allowed scientists to systematically vary the structure of chemical substances, and growth in the emerging science of pharmacology expanded their ability to evaluate the biological effects of these structural changes.

====Epinephrine, norepinephrine, and amphetamine====
By the 1890s, the profound effect of adrenal extracts on many different tissue types had been discovered, setting off a search both for the mechanism of chemical signaling and efforts to exploit these observations for the development of new drugs. The blood pressure raising and vasoconstrictive effects of adrenal extracts were of particular interest to surgeons as hemostatic agents and as a treatment for shock, and several companies developed products based on adrenal extracts containing varying purities of the active substance. In 1897, John Abel at the Johns Hopkins University identified the active principle as epinephrine, which he isolated in an impure state as the sulfate salt. Industrial chemist Jōkichi Takamine later developed a method for obtaining epinephrine in a pure state and licensed the technology to Parke-Davis. Parke-Davis marketed epinephrine under the trade name Adrenalin. Injected epinephrine proved to be especially efficacious for the acute treatment of asthma attacks, and an inhaled version was sold in the United States until 2011 (Primatene Mist). By 1929 epinephrine had been formulated into an inhaler for use in the treatment of nasal congestion.

While highly effective, the requirement for injection limited the use of epinephrine and orally active derivatives were sought. A structurally similar compound, ephedrine, was identified by Japanese chemists in the &quot;Ma Huang&quot; plant and marketed by Eli Lilly as an oral treatment for asthma. Following the work of Henry Dale and George Barger at Burroughs-Wellcome, academic chemist Gordon Alles synthesized amphetamine and tested it in asthma patients in 1929. The drug proved to have only modest anti-asthma effects but produced sensations of exhilaration and palpitations. Amphetamine was developed by Smith, Kline and French as a nasal decongestant under the trade name Benzedrine Inhaler. Amphetamine was eventually developed for the treatment of narcolepsy, post-encephalitic parkinsonism, and mood elevation in depression and other psychiatric indications. It received approval as a New and Nonofficial Remedy from the American Medical Association for these uses in 1937, and remained in common use for depression until the development of tricyclic antidepressants in the 1960s.

====Discovery and development of the barbiturates====

In 1903, Hermann Emil Fischer and Joseph von Mering disclosed their discovery that diethylbarbituric acid, formed from the reaction of acid, phosphorus oxychloride and urea, induces sleep in dogs. The discovery was patented and licensed to Bayer pharmaceuticals, which marketed the compound under the trade name Veronal as a sleep aid beginning in 1904. Systematic investigations of the effect of structural changes on potency and duration of action led to the discovery of phenobarbital at Bayer in 1911 and the discovery of its potent anti-epileptic activity in 1912. Phenobarbital was among the most widely used drugs for the treatment of epilepsy through the 1970s, and as of 2014, remains on the World Health Organization&#x27;s list of essential medications. The 1950s and 1960s saw increased awareness of the addictive properties and abuse potential of barbiturates and amphetamines and led to increasing restrictions on their use and growing government oversight of prescribers. Today, amphetamine is largely restricted to use in the treatment of attention deficit disorder and phenobarbital in the treatment of epilepsy.

In 1958, Leo Sternbach discovered the first benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide (Librium). Dozens of other benzodiazepines have been developed and are in use, some of the more popular drugs being diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), clonazepam (Klonopin), and lorazepam (Ativan). Due to their far superior safety and therapeutic properties, benzodiazepines have largely replaced the use of barbiturates in medicine, except in certain special cases. When it was later discovered that benzodiazepines, like barbiturates, significantly lose their effectiveness and can have serious side effects when taken long-term, Heather Ashton researched benzodiazepine dependence and developed a protocol to discontinue their use.

====Insulin====
A series of experiments performed from the late 1800s to the early 1900s revealed that diabetes is caused by the absence of a substance normally produced by the pancreas. In 1869, Oskar Minkowski and Joseph von Mering found that diabetes could be induced in dogs by surgical removal of the pancreas. In 1921, Canadian professor Frederick Banting and his student Charles Best repeated this study and found that injections of pancreatic extract reversed the symptoms produced by pancreas removal. Soon, the extract was demonstrated to work in people, but the development of insulin therapy as a routine medical procedure was delayed by difficulties in producing the material in sufficient quantity and with reproducible purity. The researchers sought assistance from industrial collaborators at Eli Lilly and Co. based on the company&#x27;s experience with large-scale purification of biological materials. Chemist George B. Walden of Eli Lilly and Company found that careful adjustment of the pH of the extract allowed a relatively pure grade of insulin to be produced. Under pressure from Toronto University and a potential patent challenge by academic scientists who had independently developed a similar purification method, an agreement was reached for the non-exclusive production of insulin by multiple companies. Before the discovery and widespread availability of insulin therapy, the life expectancy of diabetics was only a few months.

====Early anti-infective research: salvarsan, prontosil, penicillin and vaccines====
The development of drugs for the treatment of infectious diseases was a major focus of early research and development efforts; in 1900, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and diarrhea were the three leading causes of death in the United States and mortality in the first year of life exceeded 10%.

In 1911 arsphenamine, the first synthetic anti-infective drug, was developed by Paul Ehrlich and chemist Alfred Bertheim of the Institute of Experimental Therapy in Berlin. The drug was given the commercial name Salvarsan. Ehrlich, noting both the general toxicity of arsenic and the selective absorption of certain dyes by bacteria, hypothesized that an arsenic-containing dye with similar selective absorption properties could be used to treat bacterial infections. Arsphenamine was prepared as part of a campaign to synthesize a series of such compounds and exhibited partially selective toxicity. Arsphenamine proved to be the first effective treatment for syphilis, a disease that until then had been incurable and led inexorably to severe skin ulceration, neurological damage, and death.

Ehrlich&#x27;s approach of systematically varying the chemical structure of synthetic compounds and measuring the effects of these changes on biological activity was pursued broadly by industrial scientists, including Bayer scientists Josef Klarer, Fritz Mietzsch, and Gerhard Domagk. This work, also based on the testing of compounds available from the German dye industry, led to the development of Prontosil, the first representative of the sulfonamide class of antibiotics. Compared to arsphenamine, the sulfonamides had a broader spectrum of activity and were far less toxic, rendering them useful for infections caused by pathogens such as streptococci. In 1939, Domagk received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for this discovery. Nonetheless, the dramatic decrease in deaths from infectious diseases that occurred before World War II was primarily the result of improved public health measures such as clean water and less crowded housing, and the impact of anti-infective drugs and vaccines was significant mainly after World War II.

In 1928, Alexander Fleming discovered the antibacterial effects of penicillin, but its exploitation for the treatment of human disease awaited the development of methods for its large-scale production and purification. These were developed by a U.S. and British government-led consortium of pharmaceutical companies during the world war.

There was early progress toward the development of vaccines throughout this period, primarily in the form of academic and government-funded basic research directed toward the identification of the pathogens responsible for common communicable diseases. In 1885, Louis Pasteur and Pierre Paul Émile Roux created the first rabies vaccine. The first diphtheria vaccines were produced in 1914 from a mixture of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin (produced from the serum of an inoculated animal), but the safety of the inoculation was marginal and it was not widely used. The United States recorded 206,000 cases of diphtheria in 1921, resulting in 15,520 deaths. In 1923, parallel efforts by Gaston Ramon at the Pasteur Institute and Alexander Glenny at the Wellcome Research Laboratories (later part of GlaxoSmithKline) led to the discovery that a safer vaccine could be produced by treating diphtheria toxin with formaldehyde. In 1944, Maurice Hilleman of Squibb Pharmaceuticals developed the first vaccine against Japanese Encephalitis. Hilleman later moved to Merck, where he played a key role in the development of vaccines against measles, mumps, chickenpox, rubella, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and meningitis.

====Unsafe drugs and early industry regulation====

Prior to the 20th century, drugs were generally produced by small scale manufacturers with little regulatory control over manufacturing or claims of safety and efficacy. To the extent that such laws did exist, enforcement was lax. In the United States, increased regulation of vaccines and other biological drugs was spurred by tetanus outbreaks and deaths caused by the distribution of contaminated smallpox vaccine and diphtheria antitoxin. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 required that federal government grant premarket approval for every biological drug and for the process and facility producing such drugs. This was followed in 1906 by the Pure Food and Drugs Act, which forbade the interstate distribution of adulterated or misbranded foods and drugs. A drug was considered misbranded if it contained alcohol, morphine, opium, cocaine, or any of several other potentially dangerous or addictive drugs, and if its label failed to indicate the quantity or proportion of such drugs. The government&#x27;s attempts to use the law to prosecute manufacturers for making unsupported claims of efficacy were undercut by a Supreme Court ruling restricting the federal government&#x27;s enforcement powers to cases of incorrect specification of the drug&#x27;s ingredients.

In 1937 over 100 people died after ingesting &quot;Elixir Sulfanilamide&quot; manufactured by S.E. Massengill Company of Tennessee. The product was formulated in diethylene glycol, a highly toxic solvent that is now widely used as antifreeze. Under the laws extant at that time, prosecution of the manufacturer was possible only under the technicality that the product had been called an &quot;elixir&quot;, which implied a solution in ethanol. In response to this episode, the U.S. Congress passed the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, which for the first time required pre-market demonstration of safety before a drug could be sold, and explicitly prohibited false therapeutic claims.

===1945–1970===

====Further advances in anti-infective research====

The aftermath of World War II saw an explosion in the discovery of new classes of antibacterial drugs including the cephalosporins (developed by Eli Lilly based on the seminal work of Giuseppe Brotzu and Edward Abraham), streptomycin (discovered during a Merck-funded research program in Selman Waksman&#x27;s laboratory), the tetracyclines (discovered at Lederle Laboratories, now a part of Pfizer), erythromycin (discovered at Eli Lilly and Co.) and their extension to an increasingly wide range of bacterial pathogens. Streptomycin, discovered during a Merck-funded research program in Selman Waksman&#x27;s laboratory at Rutgers in 1943, became the first effective treatment for tuberculosis. At the time of its discovery, sanitoriums for the isolation of tuberculosis-infected people were a ubiquitous feature of cities in developed countries, with 50% dying within 5 years of admission.

A Federal Trade Commission report issued in 1958 attempted to quantify the effect of antibiotic development on American public health. The report found that over the period 1946–1955, there was a 42% drop in the incidence of diseases for which antibiotics were effective and only a 20% drop in those for which antibiotics were not effective. The report concluded that &quot;it appears that the use of antibiotics, early diagnosis, and other factors have limited the epidemic spread and thus the number of these diseases which have occurred&quot;. The study further examined mortality rates for eight common diseases for which antibiotics offered effective therapy (syphilis, tuberculosis, dysentery, scarlet fever, whooping cough, meningococcal infections, and pneumonia), and found a 56% decline over the same period. Notable among these was a 75% decline in deaths due to tuberculosis.

During the years 1940–1955, the rate of decline in the U.S. death rate accelerated from 2% per year to 8% per year, then returned to the historical rate of 2% per year. The dramatic decline in the immediate post-war years has been attributed to the rapid development of new treatments and vaccines for infectious disease that occurred during these years.
Vaccine development continued to accelerate, with the most notable achievement of the period being Jonas Salk&#x27;s 1954 development of the polio vaccine under the funding of the non-profit National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. The vaccine process was never patented but was instead given to pharmaceutical companies to manufacture as a low-cost generic. In 1960 Maurice Hilleman of Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme identified the SV40 virus, which was later shown to cause tumors in many mammalian species. It was later determined that SV40 was present as a contaminant in polio vaccine lots that had been administered to 90% of the children in the United States. The contamination appears to have originated both in the original cell stock and in monkey tissue used for production. In 2004 the National Cancer Institute announced that it had concluded that SV40 is not associated with cancer in people.

Other notable new vaccines of the period include those for measles (1962, John Franklin Enders of Children&#x27;s Medical Center Boston, later refined by Maurice Hilleman at Merck), Rubella (1969, Hilleman, Merck) and mumps (1967, Hilleman, Merck) The United States incidences of rubella, congenital rubella syndrome, measles, and mumps all fell by &gt;95% in the immediate aftermath of widespread vaccination. The first 20 years of licensed measles vaccination in the U.S. prevented an estimated 52 million cases of the disease, 17,400 cases of mental retardation, and 5,200 deaths.

====Development and marketing of antihypertensive drugs====
Hypertension is a risk factor for atherosclerosis, heart failure, coronary artery disease, stroke, renal disease, and peripheral arterial disease, and is the most important risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, in industrialized countries. Prior to 1940 approximately 23% of all deaths among persons over age 50 were attributed to hypertension. Severe cases of hypertension were treated by surgery.

Early developments in the field of treating hypertension included quaternary ammonium ion sympathetic nervous system blocking agents, but these compounds were never widely used due to their severe side effects, because the long-term health consequences of high blood pressure had not yet been established, and because they had to be administered by injection.

In 1952 researchers at Ciba discovered the first orally available vasodilator, hydralazine. A major shortcoming of hydralazine monotherapy was that it lost its effectiveness over time (tachyphylaxis). In the mid-1950s Karl H. Beyer, James M. Sprague, John E. Baer, and Frederick C. Novello of Merck and Co. discovered and developed chlorothiazide, which remains the most widely used antihypertensive drug today. This development was associated with a substantial decline in the mortality rate among people with hypertension. The inventors were recognized by a Public Health Lasker Award in 1975 for &quot;the saving of untold thousands of lives and the alleviation of the suffering of millions of victims of hypertension&quot;.

A 2009 Cochrane review concluded that thiazide antihypertensive drugs reduce the risk of death (RR 0.89), stroke (RR 0.63), coronary heart disease (RR 0.84), and cardiovascular events (RR 0.70) in people with high blood pressure. In the ensuring years other classes of the antihypertensive drug were developed and found wide acceptance in combination therapy, including loop diuretics (Lasix/furosemide, Hoechst Pharmaceuticals, 1963), beta blockers (ICI Pharmaceuticals, 1964) ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers. ACE inhibitors reduce the risk of new-onset kidney disease [RR 0.71] and death [RR 0.84] in diabetic patients, irrespective of whether they have hypertension.

====Oral contraceptives====
Prior to the Second World War, birth control was prohibited in many countries, and in the United States even the discussion of contraceptive methods sometimes led to prosecution under Comstock laws. The history of the development of oral contraceptives is thus closely tied to the birth control movement and the efforts of activists Margaret Sanger, Mary Dennett, and Emma Goldman. Based on fundamental research performed by Gregory Pincus and synthetic methods for progesterone developed by Carl Djerassi at Syntex and by Frank Colton at G.D. Searle &amp; Co., the first oral contraceptive, Enovid, was developed by G.D. Searle &amp; Co. and approved by the FDA in 1960. The original formulation incorporated vastly excessive doses of hormones and caused severe side effects. Nonetheless, by 1962, 1.2 million American women were on the pill, and by 1965 the number had increased to 6.5 million. The availability of a convenient form of temporary contraceptive led to dramatic changes in social mores including expanding the range of lifestyle options available to women, reducing the reliance of women on men for contraceptive practice, encouraging the delay of marriage, and increasing pre-marital co-habitation.

====Thalidomide and the Kefauver-Harris amendments====

In the U.S., a push for revisions of the FD&amp;C Act emerged from Congressional hearings led by Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee in 1959. The hearings covered a wide range of policy issues, including advertising abuses, questionable efficacy of drugs, and the need for greater regulation of the industry. While momentum for new legislation temporarily flagged under extended debate, a new tragedy emerged that underscored the need for more comprehensive regulation and provided the driving force for the passage of new laws.

On 12 September 1960, an American licensee, the William S. Merrell Company of Cincinnati, submitted a new drug application for Kevadon (thalidomide), a sedative that had been marketed in Europe since 1956. The FDA medical officer in charge of reviewing the compound, Frances Kelsey, believed that the data supporting the safety of thalidomide was incomplete. The firm continued to pressure Kelsey and the FDA to approve the application until November 1961, when the drug was pulled off the German market because of its association with grave congenital abnormalities. Several thousand newborns in Europe and elsewhere suffered the teratogenic effects of thalidomide. Without approval from the FDA, the firm distributed Kevadon to over 1,000 physicians there under the guise of investigational use. Over 20,000 Americans received thalidomide in this &quot;study,&quot; including 624 pregnant patients, and about 17 known newborns suffered the effects of the drug.

The thalidomide tragedy resurrected Kefauver&#x27;s bill to enhance drug regulation that had stalled in Congress, and the Kefauver-Harris Amendment became law on 10 October 1962. Manufacturers henceforth had to prove to the FDA that their drugs were effective as well as safe before they could go on the US market. The FDA received authority to regulate the advertising of prescription drugs and to establish good manufacturing practices. The law required that all drugs introduced between 1938 and 1962 had to be effective. A collaborative study by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the National Academy of Sciences showed that nearly 40 percent of these products were not effective. A similarly comprehensive study of over-the-counter products began ten years later.

===1970–1990s===

====Statins====

In 1971, Akira Endo, a Japanese biochemist working for the pharmaceutical company Sankyo, identified mevastatin (ML-236B), a molecule produced by the fungus &quot;Penicillium citrinum&quot;, as an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, a critical enzyme used by the body to produce cholesterol. Animal trials showed very good inhibitory effects as in clinical trials, however a long-term study in dogs found toxic effects at higher doses and as a result, mevastatin was believed to be too toxic for human use. Mevastatin was never marketed, because of its adverse effects of tumors, muscle deterioration, and sometimes death in laboratory dogs.

P. Roy Vagelos, chief scientist and later CEO of Merck &amp; Co, was interested and made several trips to Japan starting in 1975. By 1978, Merck had isolated lovastatin (mevinolin, MK803) from the fungus &quot;Aspergillus terreus&quot;, first marketed in 1987 as Mevacor.

In April 1994, the results of a Merck-sponsored study, the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study, were announced. Researchers tested simvastatin, later sold by Merck as Zocor, on 4,444 patients with high cholesterol and heart disease. After five years, the study concluded the patients saw a 35% reduction in their cholesterol, and their chances of dying of a heart attack were reduced by 42%. In 1995, Zocor and Mevacor both made Merck over US$1 billion. Endo was awarded the 2006 Japan Prize, and the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award in 2008. For his &quot;pioneering research into a new class of molecules&quot; for &quot;lowering cholesterol,&quot;

===21st Century===
Since several decades, biologics have been rising in importance in comparison with small molecule treatments. The biotech subsector, animal health and the Chinese pharmaceutical sector have also grown substantially. On the organisational side, big international pharma corporations have experienced a substantial decline of their value share. Also, the core generic sector (substitutions for off-patent brands) has been down valued due to competition.

Torreya estimated the pharmaceutical industry to have a market valuation of US$7.03 trillion by February 2021 from which US$6.1 trillion is the value of the publicly traded companies. Small Molecules modality had 58.2% of the valuation share down from 84.6% in 2003. Biologics was up at 30.5% from 14.5%. The valuation share of Chinese Pharma grew from 2003 to 2021 from 1% to 12% overtaking Switzerland who is now ranked number 3 with 7.7%. The United States had still by far the most valued pharmaceutical industry with 40% of global valuation. 2023 was a year of layoffs for at least 10,000 people across 129 public biotech firms globally, albeit most small firms; this was a significant increase in reductions versus 2022 was in part due to worsening global financial conditions and a reduction in investment by &quot;generalist investors&quot;. Private firms also saw a significant reduction in venture capital investment in 2023, continuing a downward trend started in 2021, which also led to a reduction in initial public offerings being floated.

=== Impact of mergers and acquisitions ===
A 2022 article articulated this notion succinctly by saying &quot;In the business of drug development, deals can be just as important as scientific breakthroughs&quot;, typically referred to as pharmaceutical M&amp;A (for mergers and acquisitions). It highlighted that some of the most impactful of the remedies of the early 21st Century was only made possible through M&amp;A activities, specifically noting Keytruda and Humira.

==Research and development==

Drug discovery is the process by which potential drugs are discovered or designed. In the past, most drugs have been discovered either by isolating the active ingredient from traditional remedies or by serendipitous discovery. Modern biotechnology often focuses on understanding the metabolic pathways related to a disease state or pathogen, and manipulating these pathways using molecular biology or biochemistry. A great deal of early-stage drug discovery has traditionally been carried out by universities and research institutions.

Drug development refers to activities undertaken after a compound is identified as a potential drug in order to establish its suitability as a medication. Objectives of drug development are to determine appropriate formulation and dosing, as well as to establish safety. Research in these areas generally includes a combination of &quot;in vitro&quot; studies, &quot;in vivo&quot; studies, and clinical trials. The cost of late stage development has meant it is usually done by the larger pharmaceutical companies. The pharmaceuticals and biotechnology industry spends more than 15% of its net sales for Research &amp; Development which is in comparison with other industries by far the highest share.

Often, large multinational corporations exhibit vertical integration, participating in a broad range of drug discovery and development, manufacturing and quality control, marketing, sales, and distribution. Smaller organizations, on the other hand, often focus on a specific aspect such as discovering drug candidates or developing formulations. Often, collaborative agreements between research organizations and large pharmaceutical companies are formed to explore the potential of new drug substances. More recently, multi-nationals are increasingly relying on contract research organizations to manage drug development.

===The cost of innovation===

Drug discovery and development are very expensive; of all compounds investigated for use in humans only a small fraction are eventually approved in most nations by government-appointed medical institutions or boards, who have to approve new drugs before they can be marketed in those countries. In 2010 18 NMEs (New Molecular Entities) were approved and three biologics by the FDA, or 21 in total, which is down from 26 in 2009 and 24 in 2008. On the other hand, there were only 18 approvals in total in 2007 and 22 back in 2006. Since 2001, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has averaged 22.9 approvals a year.
This approval comes only after heavy investment in pre-clinical development and clinical trials, as well as a commitment to ongoing safety monitoring. Drugs which fail part-way through this process often incur large costs, while generating no revenue in return. If the cost of these failed drugs is taken into account, the cost of developing a successful new drug (new chemical entity, or NCE), has been estimated at US$1.3 billion (not including marketing expenses). Professors Light and Lexchin reported in 2012, however, that the rate of approval for new drugs has been a relatively stable average rate of 15 to 25 for decades.

Industry-wide research and investment reached a record $65.3 billion in 2009. While the cost of research in the U.S. was about 34.2 billion between 1995 and 2010, revenues rose faster (revenues rose by 200.4 billion in that time).

A study by the consulting firm Bain &amp; Company reported that the cost for discovering, developing and launching (which factored in marketing and other business expenses) a new drug (along with the prospective drugs that fail) rose over a five-year period to nearly $1.7 billion in 2003. According to Forbes, by 2010 development costs were between $4 billion to $11 billion per drug.

Some of these estimates also take into account the opportunity cost of investing capital many years before revenues are realized (see Time-value of money). Because of the very long time needed for the discovery, development, and approval of pharmaceuticals, these costs can accumulate to nearly half the total expense. A direct consequence within the pharmaceutical industry value chain is that major pharmaceutical multinationals tend to increasingly outsource risks related to fundamental research, which somewhat reshapes the industry ecosystem with biotechnology companies playing an increasingly important role, and overall strategies being redefined accordingly. Some approved drugs, such as those based on re-formulation of an existing active ingredient (also referred to as Line-extensions) are much less expensive to develop.

==Product approval==
In the United States, new pharmaceutical products must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as being both safe and effective. This process generally involves the submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) filing with sufficient pre-clinical data to support proceeding with human trials. Following IND approval, three phases of progressively larger human clinical trials may be conducted. Phase I generally studies toxicity using healthy volunteers. Phase II can include pharmacokinetics and dosing in patients, and Phase III is a very large study of efficacy in the intended patient population. Following the successful completion of Phase III testing, a New Drug Application is submitted to the FDA. The FDA reviews the data and if the product is seen as having a positive benefit-risk assessment, approval to market the product in the US is granted.

A fourth phase of post-approval surveillance is also often required due to the fact that even the largest clinical trials cannot effectively predict the prevalence of rare side effects. Postmarketing surveillance ensures that after marketing the safety of a drug is monitored closely. In certain instances, its indication may need to be limited to particular patient groups, and in others, the substance is withdrawn from the market completely.

The FDA provides information about approved drugs at the Orange Book site.

In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) approves and evaluates drugs for use. Normally an approval in the UK and other European countries comes later than one in the USA. Then it is the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), for England and Wales, who decides if and how the National Health Service (NHS) will allow (in the sense of paying for) their use. The British National Formulary is the core guide for pharmacists and clinicians.

In many non-US western countries, a &#x27;fourth hurdle&#x27; of cost effectiveness analysis has developed before new technologies can be provided. This focuses on the &#x27;efficacy price tag&#x27; (in terms of, for example, the cost per QALY) of the technologies in question. In England and Wales NICE decides whether and in what circumstances drugs and technologies will be made available by the NHS, whilst similar arrangements exist with the Scottish Medicines Consortium in Scotland, and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee in Australia. A product must pass the threshold for cost-effectiveness if it is to be approved. Treatments must represent &#x27;value for money&#x27; and a net benefit to society.

===Orphan drugs===

There are special rules for certain rare diseases (&quot;orphan diseases&quot;) in several major drug regulatory territories. For example, diseases involving fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States, or larger populations in certain circumstances are subject to the Orphan Drug Act. Because medical research and development of drugs to treat such diseases is financially disadvantageous, companies that do so are rewarded with tax reductions, fee waivers, and market exclusivity on that drug for a limited time (seven years), regardless of whether the drug is protected by patents.

== Global sales ==
In 2011, global spending on prescription drugs topped $954 billion, even as growth slowed somewhat in Europe and North America. The United States accounts for more than a third of the global pharmaceutical market, with $340 billion in annual sales followed by the EU and Japan. Emerging markets such as China, Russia, South Korea and Mexico outpaced that market, growing a huge 81 percent.

The top ten best-selling drugs of 2013 totaled $75.6 billion in sales, with the anti-inflammatory drug Humira being the best-selling drug worldwide at $10.7 billion in sales. The second and third best selling were Enbrel and Remicade, respectively. The top three best-selling drugs in the United States in 2013 were Abilify ($6.3 billion,) Nexium ($6 billion) and Humira ($5.4 billion). The best-selling drug ever, Lipitor, averaged $13 billion annually and netted $141 billion total over its lifetime before Pfizer&#x27;s patent expired in November 2011.

IMS Health publishes an analysis of trends expected in the pharmaceutical industry in 2007, including increasing profits in most sectors despite loss of some patents, and new &#x27;blockbuster&#x27; drugs on the horizon.

=== Patents and generics ===
Depending on a number of considerations, a company may apply for and be granted a patent for the drug, or the process of producing the drug, granting exclusivity rights typically for about 20 years. However, only after rigorous study and testing, which takes 10 to 15 years on average, will governmental authorities grant permission for the company to market and sell the drug. Patent protection enables the owner of the patent to recover the costs of research and development through high profit margins for the branded drug. When the patent protection for the drug expires, a generic drug is usually developed and sold by a competing company. The development and approval of generics are less expensive, allowing them to be sold at a lower price. Often the owner of the branded drug will introduce a generic version before the patent expires in order to get a head start in the generic market. Restructuring has therefore become routine, driven by the patent expiration of products launched during the industry&#x27;s &quot;golden era&quot; in the 1990s and companies&#x27; failure to develop sufficient new blockbuster products to replace lost revenues.

=== Prescriptions ===
In the U.S., the value of prescriptions increased over the period of 1995 to 2005 by 3.4 billion annually, a 61 percent increase. Retail sales of prescription drugs jumped 250 percent from $72 billion to $250 billion, while the average price of prescriptions more than doubled from $30 to $68.

==Marketing==

Advertising is common in healthcare journals as well as through more mainstream media routes. In some countries, notably the US, they are allowed to advertise directly to the general public. Pharmaceutical companies generally employ salespeople (often called &#x27;drug reps&#x27; or, an older term, &#x27;detail men&#x27;) to market directly and personally to physicians and other healthcare providers. In some countries, notably the US, pharmaceutical companies also employ lobbyists to influence politicians. Marketing of prescription drugs in the US is regulated by the federal Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987. The pharmaceutical marketing plan incorporates the spending plans, channels, and thoughts which will take the drug association, and its items and administrations, forward in the current scene.

===To healthcare professionals===
The book &quot;Bad Pharma&quot; also discusses the influence of drug representatives, how ghostwriters are employed by the drug companies to write papers for academics to publish, how independent the academic journals really are, how the drug companies finance doctors&#x27; continuing education, and how patients&#x27; groups are often funded by industry.

===Direct to consumer advertising===
Since the 1980s, new methods of marketing prescription drugs to consumers have become important. Direct-to-consumer media advertising was legalised in the FDA Guidance for Industry on Consumer-Directed Broadcast Advertisements.

==Controversies==
===Drug marketing and lobbying===
There have been many controversies surrounding pharmaceutical marketing and influence. There have been accusations and findings of influence on doctors and other health professionals through drug representatives including the constant provision of marketing &#x27;gifts&#x27; and biased information to health professionals. As well as highly prevalent advertising in journals and conferences, funding independent healthcare organizations and health promotion campaigns, being at a time the most lobbied industry in the US, sponsorship of medical schools or nurse training, sponsorship of continuing educational events, with influence on the curriculum, and hiring physicians and doctors as paid consultants on medical advisory boards.

Some advocacy groups, such as No Free Lunch and AllTrials, have criticized the effect of drug marketing to physicians because they say it biases physicians to prescribe the marketed drugs even when others might be cheaper or better for the patient.

There have been related accusations of disease mongering (over-medicalising) to expand the market for medications. An inaugural conference on that subject took place in Australia in 2006. In 2009, the Government-funded National Prescribing Service launched the &quot;Finding Evidence – Recognising Hype&quot; program, aimed at educating on methods for independent drug analysis.

Meta-analyses have shown that psychiatric studies sponsored by pharmaceutical companies are several times more likely to report positive results, and if a drug company employee is involved the effect is even larger. Influence has also extended to the training of doctors and nurses in medical schools, which is being fought.

It has been argued that the design of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the expansion of the criteria represents an increasing medicalization of human nature, or &quot;disease mongering&quot;, driven by drug company influence on psychiatry. The potential for direct conflict of interest has been raised, partly because roughly half the authors who selected and defined the DSM-IV psychiatric disorders had or previously had financial relationships with the pharmaceutical industry.

In the US, starting in 2013, under the Physician Financial Transparency Reports (part of the Sunshine Act), the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services has to collect information from applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations in order to report information about their financial relationships with physicians and hospitals. Data are made public on the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services website. The expectation is that the relationship between doctors and the Pharmaceutical industry will become fully transparent.

In a report conducted by OpenSecrets, there were more than 1,100 lobbyists working in some capacity for the pharmaceutical business in 2017. In the first quarter of 2017, the health products and pharmaceutical industry spent $78 million on lobbying members of the United States Congress.

===Medication pricing===

The pricing of pharmaceuticals is becoming a major challenge for health systems. A November 2020 study by the West Health Policy Center stated that more than 1.1 million senior citizens in the U.S. Medicare program is expected to die prematurely over the next decade because they will be unable to afford their prescription medications, requiring an additional $17.7 billion to be spent annually on avoidable medical costs due to health complications.

===Regulatory issues===
Ben Goldacre has argued that regulators – such as the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK, or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States – advance the interests of the drug companies rather than the interests of the public due to revolving door exchange of employees between the regulator and the companies and friendships develop between regulator and company employees. He argues that regulators do not require that new drugs offer an improvement over what is already available, or even that they be particularly effective.

Others have argued that excessive regulation suppresses therapeutic innovation and that the current cost of regulator-required clinical trials prevents the full exploitation of new genetic and biological knowledge for the treatment of human disease. A 2012 report by the President&#x27;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology made several key recommendations to reduce regulatory burdens to new drug development, including 1) expanding the FDA&#x27;s use of accelerated approval processes, 2) creating an expedited approval pathway for drugs intended for use in narrowly defined populations, and 3) undertaking pilot projects designed to evaluate the feasibility of a new, adaptive drug approval process.

===Pharmaceutical fraud===
 
Pharmaceutical fraud involves deceptions that bring financial gain to a pharmaceutical company. It affects individuals and public and private insurers. There are several different schemes used to defraud the health care system which are particular to the pharmaceutical industry. These include: Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Violations, Off Label Marketing, Best Price Fraud, CME Fraud, Medicaid Price Reporting, and Manufactured Compound Drugs. Of this amount $2.5 billion was recovered through &quot;False Claims Act&quot; cases in FY 2010. Examples of fraud cases include the GlaxoSmithKline $3 billion settlement, Pfizer $2.3 billion settlement and Merck &amp; Co. $650 million settlement. Damages from fraud can be recovered by use of the False Claims Act, most commonly under the &quot;qui tam&quot; provisions which reward an individual for being a &quot;whistleblower&quot;, or relator (law).

Every major company selling atypical antipsychotics—Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly and Company, Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson—has either settled recent government cases, under the False Claims Act, for hundreds of millions of dollars or is currently under investigation for possible health care fraud. Following charges of illegal marketing, two of the settlements set records in 2009 for the largest criminal fines ever imposed on corporations. One involved Eli Lilly&#x27;s antipsychotic Zyprexa, and the other involved Bextra, an anti-inflammatory medication used for arthritis. In the Bextra case, the government also charged Pfizer with illegally marketing another antipsychotic, Geodon; Pfizer settled that part of the claim for $301 million, without admitting any wrongdoing.

In July 2012, GlaxoSmithKline pleaded guilty to criminal charges and agreed to a $3 billion settlement of the largest health-care fraud case in the U.S. and the largest payment by a drug company. The settlement is related to the company&#x27;s illegal promotion of prescription drugs, its failure to report safety data, bribing doctors, and promoting medicines for uses for which they were not licensed. The drugs involved were Paxil, Wellbutrin, Advair, Lamictal, and Zofran for off-label, non-covered uses. Those and the drugs Imitrex, Lotronex, Flovent, and Valtrex were involved in the kickback scheme.

The following is a list of the four largest settlements reached with pharmaceutical companies from 1991 to 2012, rank ordered by the size of the total settlement. Legal claims against the pharmaceutical industry have varied widely over the past two decades, including Medicare and Medicaid fraud, off-label promotion, and inadequate manufacturing practices.

===Physician roles===

In May 2015, the New England Journal of Medicine emphasized the importance of pharmaceutical industry-physician interactions for the development of novel treatments and argued that moral outrage over industry malfeasance had unjustifiably led many to overemphasize the problems created by financial conflicts of interest. The article noted that major healthcare organizations, such as National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health, the President&#x27;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, the World Economic Forum, the Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust, and the Food and Drug Administration had encouraged greater interactions between physicians and industry in order to improve benefits to patients.

=== Response to COVID-19 ===

In November 2020 several pharmaceutical companies announced successful trials of COVID-19 vaccines, with efficacy
of 90 to 95% in preventing infection. Per company announcements and data reviewed by external analysts, these vaccines are priced at $3 to $37 per dose. The Wall Street Journal ran an editorial calling for this achievement to be recognized with a Nobel Peace Prize.

Doctors Without Borders warned that high prices and monopolies on medicines, tests, and vaccines would prolong the pandemic and cost lives. They urged governments to prevent profiteering, using compulsory licenses as needed, as had already been done by Canada, Chile, Ecuador, Germany, and Israel.

On 20 February, 46 US lawmakers called for the US government not to grant monopoly rights when giving out taxpayer development money for any coronavirus vaccines and treatments, to avoid giving exclusive control of prices and availability to private manufacturers.

In the United States, the government signed agreements in which research and development or the building of manufacturing plants for potential COVID-19 therapeutics was subsidized. Typically, the agreement involved the government taking ownership of a certain number of doses of the product without further payment. For example, under the auspices of Operation Warp Speed in the United States, the government subsidized research related to COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics at Regeneron, Johnson and Johnson, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Novavax, Pfizer, and GSK. Typical terms involved research subsidies of $400 million to $2 billion, and included government ownership of the first 100 million doses of any COVID-19 vaccine successfully developed.

American pharmaceutical company Gilead sought and obtained orphan drug status for remdesivir from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 23 March 2020. This provision is intended to encourage the development of drugs affecting fewer than 200,000 Americans by granting strengthened and extended legal monopoly rights to the manufacturer, along with waivers on taxes and government fees. Remdesivir is a candidate for treating COVID-19; at the time the status was granted, fewer than 200,000 Americans had COVID-19, but numbers were climbing rapidly as the COVID-19 pandemic reached the US, and crossing the threshold soon was considered inevitable. Remdesivir was developed by Gilead with over $79 million in U.S. government funding. In May 2020, Gilead announced that it would provide the first 940,000 doses of remdesivir to the federal government free of charge. After facing strong public reactions, Gilead gave up the &quot;orphan drug&quot; status for remdesivir on 25 March. Gilead retains 20-year remdesivir patents in more than 70 countries. In May 2020, the company further announced that it was in discussions with several generics companies to provide rights to produce remdesivir for developing countries, and with the Medicines Patent Pool to provide broader generic access.

==Developing world==

===Patents===
Patents have been criticized in the developing world, as they are thought to reduce access to existing medicines. Reconciling patents and universal access to medicine would require an efficient international policy of price discrimination. Moreover, under the TRIPS agreement of the World Trade Organization, countries must allow pharmaceutical products to be patented. In 2001, the WTO adopted the Doha Declaration, which indicates that the TRIPS agreement should be read with the goals of public health in mind, and allows some methods for circumventing pharmaceutical monopolies: via compulsory licensing or parallel imports, even before patent expiration.

In March 2001, 40 multi-national pharmaceutical companies brought litigation against South Africa for its Medicines Act, which allowed the generic production of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) for treating HIV, despite the fact that these drugs were on-patent. HIV was and is an epidemic in South Africa, and ARVs at the time cost between US$10,000 and US$15,000 per patient per year. This was unaffordable for most South African citizens, and so the South African government committed to providing ARVs at prices closer to what people could afford. To do so, they would need to ignore the patents on drugs and produce generics within the country (using a compulsory license), or import them from abroad. After an international protest in favour of public health rights (including the collection of 250,000 signatures by Médecins Sans Frontières), the governments of several developed countries (including The Netherlands, Germany, France, and later the US) backed the South African government, and the case was dropped in April of that year.

In 2016, GlaxoSmithKline (the world&#x27;s sixth largest pharmaceutical company) announced that it would be dropping its patents in poor countries so as to allow independent companies to make and sell versions of its drugs in those areas, thereby widening the public access to them. GlaxoSmithKline published a list of 50 countries they would no longer hold patents in, affecting one billion people worldwide.

===Charitable programs===
In 2011 four of the top 20 corporate charitable donations and eight of the top 30 corporate charitable donations came from pharmaceutical manufacturers. The bulk of corporate charitable donations (69% as of 2012) comes by way of non-cash charitable donations, the majority of which again were donations contributed by pharmaceutical companies.

Charitable programs and drug discovery &amp; development efforts by pharmaceutical companies include:
* &quot;Merck&#x27;s Gift&quot;, wherein billions of river blindness drugs were donated in Africa
* Pfizer&#x27;s gift of free/discounted fluconazole and other drugs for AIDS in South Africa
* GSK&#x27;s commitment to give free albendazole tablets to the WHO for, and until, the elimination of lymphatic filariasis worldwide.
* In 2006, Novartis committed US$755 million in corporate citizenship initiatives around the world, particularly focusing on improving access to medicines in the developing world through its Access to Medicine projects, including donations of medicines to patients affected by leprosy, tuberculosis, and malaria; Glivec patient assistance programs; and relief to support major humanitarian organisations with emergency medical needs.

<text>Rosel Marie &quot;Rosie&quot; Boycott, Baroness Boycott (born 13 May 1951) is a British journalist and feminist.

==Early life==
The daughter of Major Charles Boycott and Betty Le Sueur Boycott, Rosel Marie &quot;Rosie&quot; Boycott was born in Saint Helier, Jersey. She was privately educated at the independent Cheltenham Ladies&#x27; College and read mathematics at the University of Kent. 

==Journalism career==
Boycott worked for a year or so with &quot;Frendz&quot; radical magazine and in 1972, she co-founded the feminist magazine &quot;Spare Rib&quot; with Marsha Rowe. Later, both women became directors of Virago Press, a publisher committed to women&#x27;s writing, with Carmen Callil, who had founded the company in 1973.

From 1992 to 1996, Boycott was editor of the UK edition of the men&#x27;s magazine &quot;Esquire&quot;. From 1996 to 1998, she headed &quot;The Independent&quot; and its sister publication the &quot;Independent on Sunday&quot;. 

Later, she edited the &quot;Daily Express&quot; (May 1998–January 2001), leaving soon after the newspaper was bought by Richard Desmond, who replaced her with Chris Williams.

Boycott is currently the travel editor for &quot;The Oldie&quot; magazine and hosts &quot;The Oldie&quot; Travel Awards each year.

==Outside journalism==

Boycott has presented the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;A Good Read&quot;. She has sat on judging panels for literary awards, including chairing the panel responsible for choosing the 2001 Orange Prize for Fiction. She is also a media advisor for the Council of Europe. Boycott is a trustee of the Hay Festival in Wales and in Cartagena, Colombia. In March 2002, she denounced the New Labour government as &quot;more reminiscent of a dictatorship than a free healthy democratic system&quot;, and announced her support for the Liberal Democrats. She was rumoured to have considered becoming a Parliamentary candidate.

Boycott made several appearances on &quot;Newsnight Review&quot; and other cultural and current affairs programmes, where the fact that she is a recovering alcoholic was discussed. She started drinking heavily again after losing her job at the &quot;Express&quot;. She was banned from driving for three years in September 2003 after crashing on the A303 in Wiltshire, injuring another driver. She was cut free from the wreckage. A court was told she had also been caught drunk driving the day before. Since her accident, Boycott has been running a farm in Somerset. She campaigned for Diana, Princess of Wales in the 2002 BBC programme to find the greatest Briton.

On 5 August 2008, Boycott was appointed as the chair of &quot;London Food&quot; as part of Conservative Mayor Boris Johnson&#x27;s attempt to help improve Londoners&#x27; access to healthy, locally produced and affordable food. In September 2007, she appeared in the third series of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, and was the first contestant to be voted off. In June 2009, she appeared on &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot;. The same month she was one of five volunteers who took part in a BBC series of three programmes entitled &quot;Famous, Rich and Homeless&quot;, about living penniless on the streets of London.

In June 2018, Boycott was nominated for a life peerage by the House of Lords Appointments Commission. She was created Baroness Boycott, of Whitefield in the County of Somerset, on 9 July.

Boycott is a supporter of the Women&#x27;s Equality Party.

== Personal life ==
Boycott is married to Charles Howard KC. Her first marriage was to journalist David Leitch (1937–2004).

<doc id="560884" wikidata="Q713760" url="?curid=560884" title="Early Wynn">
<text>Early Wynn Jr. (January 6, 1920 – April 4, 1999), nicknamed &quot;Gus&quot;, was an American professional baseball right-handed pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Washington Senators, Cleveland Indians, and Chicago White Sox, during his 23-year MLB career. Wynn was identified as one of the most intimidating pitchers in the game, having combined his powerful fastball with a hard attitude toward batters. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972.

Wynn signed with the Senators at the age of 17, deciding to forgo completing his high school education to begin pursuing a baseball career. He spent three seasons in Minor League Baseball (MiLB) before achieving his first MLB stint in 1939. Wynn returned to the big leagues two years later and in 1942 pitched his first full MLB season. The following year, he won 18 games for the Senators. Drafted into the military in 1944, Wynn missed all of 1945 and a portion of the 1946 season while serving in the United States Army during World War II. He spent all of 1947 and 1948 with the Senators before getting traded to the Indians after the 1948 season.

With Cleveland, Wynn was a member of what historian David Fleitz called &quot;one of the greatest pitching rotations of all time,&quot; along with Bob Feller, Mike Garcia, and Bob Lemon. Pitching coach Mel Harder taught him a curveball, slider, and knuckleball, which Wynn credited with helping him become a better pitcher in the 1950s. He won 20 or more games in four of his seasons with the Indians, helping them set an American League (AL) record with 111 total wins in 1954. He started Game 2 of the 1954 World Series, which the New York Giants won in four games. In 1955, he was selected to his first of eight straight All-Star Games. Traded to the White Sox after the 1957 season, Wynn won the 1959 Cy Young Award, leading the AL with 22 wins as the team won the AL pennant. At 39, he became the oldest pitcher to win the award, and he was not passed for 19 years. In Game 1 of the 1959 World Series, Wynn struck out six in seven innings, allowing no runs as the White Sox won 11–0. He made two other starts in the Series but failed to pitch past the fourth inning in either, as the Los Angeles Dodgers won the series in six games. Towards the end of his career, Wynn began to rely more heavily on the knuckleball, as the velocity of his pitches declined. The White Sox released him after the 1962 season, but Wynn signed with the Indians in 1963 because he was determined to win 300 games. He picked up his 300th victory against the Kansas City Athletics on July 13, his last major league win, though he remained on the roster for the rest of the season. As of 2025, he is one of 24 MLB pitchers to win 300 games.

After his retirement as a player, Wynn served as a pitching coach for the Indians from 1964 to 1966 and the Minnesota Twins from 1967 to 1969. He later was a broadcaster for the Toronto Blue Jays and White Sox. Wynn lived in Nokomis, Florida, for many years, operating the Early Wynn Steak House and Bowling Lanes in Venice, Florida, during the 1960s. In 1999, he was included on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of the 100 greatest players in baseball history. Wynn died that year in an assisted living facility following heart-related problems and a stroke.

==Early life==
Wynn was born January 6, 1920, in Hartford, Alabama, the son of Blanche Wynn and Early Wynn Sr., an automobile mechanic and former semi-professional baseball player. Wynn described his ancestry as being Scottish, Irish, and Cherokee; sportswriter Lew Freedman speculates that Wynn was no more than Cherokee. As a youth, Wynn lifted 500-pound bales of cotton one summer for 10 cents an hour; the experience left him determined to make a different living for himself. Excelling at both football and baseball, Wynn was about to become the top running back at Geneva County High School as a sophomore, but he suffered a broken leg on a punt return that year. The injury forced him out of football and focused his attention on baseball. Wynn later described it as &quot;my best break ever.&quot;

When he was a teenager, Wynn attended a tryout session in Florida for the Washington Senators. He impressed Senators coach Clyde Milan enough that the organization offered him a minor league contract. Wynn signed with Washington for $100 per month and decided not to finish high school. Between 1937 and 1939, Wynn pitched minor league baseball in the Florida State League and the Piedmont League.

==Professional career==
===Washington Senators (1939, 1941–1944, 1946–1948)===
Wynn made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut in 1939, when he was a September callup by the Senators. He threw a complete game in his first outing on September 13, allowing four runs (three earned) in a 4–2 loss to the Chicago White Sox. Wynn made three starts, posting an 0–2 record and a 5.75 earned run average (ERA) before returning to the minor leagues for 1940 and most of 1941. David Fleitz of the Society for American Baseball Research wrote, &quot;Wynn was not yet ready for major-league action.&quot; He made it back to the major leagues in 1941, when he was again a September callup. In his first start of the year, the second game of a doubleheader against the Philadelphia Athletics, he gave up two runs and six hits, earning his first major league win in a 4–2 Senator victory. He started five games this time, completing four of them and finishing with a 3–1 record and a 1.58 ERA.

In 1942, Wynn was named to Washington&#x27;s four-man pitching rotation and spent the whole season in the major leagues for the first time. He threw a shutout on April 30 against the White Sox, allowing the Senators to win by scoring just one run. In the second game of a doubleheader against the New York Yankees on September 6, he gave up several runs–11, though only five were earned. The Senators lost 15–2. He pitched 30 games that season, finishing with a 10–16 record and a 5.12 ERA. The 16 losses ranked fifth in the American League (AL).

Wynn opened the 1943 season as the number two starter in the Senators&#x27; rotation, behind Dutch Leonard. On April 27, he threw 13 scoreless innings but received a no decision as Philadelphia defeated the Senators 2–1 in 16 innings. Against the Cleveland Indians on July 10, he allowed only four hits and threw a shutout in a 4–0 victory. He pitched innings on August 18, losing the game 3–2 in the 14th to the White Sox when Guy Curtright singled to drive in a run; however, the two runs Wynn had allowed earlier were unearned. Four days later, in the second game of a doubleheader against the St. Louis Browns, Wynn hit his first major league home run against Bob Muncrief. He was less successful on the mound, allowing seven runs in six innings as the Browns won 8–5. On September 10, he held Philadelphia to three hits in a 5–0 victory. In the first game of a doubleheader against the Yankees on September 19, Wynn gave up two runs in 10 innings as the Senators won 3–2. In 37 games, he finished 18–12 with a 2.91 ERA and 89 strikeouts, leading the AL with 33 starts. Wynn finished 18th in AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting.

On April 20, 1944, Wynn threw a two-hit shutout against the Philadelphia Athletics. He held the Indians to three runs (two earned) over 13 innings on May 26 in a 5–3 victory. On June 18, he threw a four-hit shutout against the Boston Red Sox in a 1–0 victory. He had a 6–7 record entering June 29 but would lose 10 decisions in a row starting from that date and lasting through August 13, when he finally won another game. One of those losses in the second game of a doubleheader on July 4 came after Wynn had held the White Sox to two runs in 11 innings; he gave up a third run in the 12th, and Chicago defeated Washington by a score of 3–2. Though his season ended in late August, he led the league in losses in 1944, compiling an 8–17 record and a 3.38 ERA.

Wynn&#x27;s 1944 season ended early, as he joined the United States Army on August 21. He underwent 17 weeks of training at Fort Knox before going to the Philippines to serve in the Tank Corps during World War II. Though he missed the 1945 major league season, Wynn continued to play baseball, pitching for a Pacific Army team known as the Manila Dodgers.

Returning to the United States in June 1946, Wynn was able to resume pitching for the Senators on July 16. He pitched 11 innings against the Yankees in the first game of a doubleheader on September 8, allowing only one run (unearned) and earning the victory in Washington&#x27;s 2–1 triumph. In 17 games that year, he finished with an 8–5 record and a 3.11 ERA.

In 1947, Wynn was the Senators&#x27; Opening Day starter. He came within one out of completing the first game he won that season on April 23, getting relieved by Tom Ferrick with two outs in the ninth inning but still earning the win in a 4–3 triumph over Philadelphia. On June 5, he shut out the Indians in a 3–0 victory. Wynn was selected to the 1947 AL All-Star team for the first time as a replacement for an injured Bob Feller, but he did not pitch in the AL&#x27;s 2–1 victory. In the first game of a doubleheader on July 10, he gave up 10 hits but threw a shutout in a 4–0 victory over the White Sox. On July 22, he gave up only two hits and one run (unearned) in a 6–1 victory over the Detroit Tigers. He pitched 33 games that year and earned a decision in almost every game, totaling 17 wins with 15 losses and a 3.64 ERA. After the season, he finished 23rd in AL MVP voting.

Wynn made the Opening Day start again for the Senators in 1948 but gave up 12 runs (10 earned) over innings in a 12–4 loss to the Senators. On May 6, he limited Cleveland to three hits in a shutout as the Senators beat the Indians by a score of 5–0. He had a 7–7 record through the end of June but only won one more game the rest of the season (against the Indians on August 29), losing 12 games and posting a 6.96 ERA in the season&#x27;s second half. In 1948, Wynn was the victim of inconsistency, posting an 8–19 record and a 5.82 ERA. He gave up a league-high 128 earned runs, and his 19 losses were third in the league (behind Fred Sanford&#x27;s 21 and Bill Wight&#x27;s 20). When hitting, though, he had a career-high 16 runs batted in (RBI).

During the offseason, the Senators made Wynn available for trade. The Boston Red Sox offered Johnny Pesky to Washington for Wynn in November, but the trade did not go through. However, Bill Veeck, who owned the Indians, had been trying to acquire Wynn since before the 1948 season. In December, Wynn and Mickey Vernon were sent to the Cleveland Indians in exchange for Joe Haynes, Ed Klieman and Eddie Robinson.

===Cleveland Indians (1949–1957)===
The Indians were excited about Wynn&#x27;s potential, but they felt he needed more pitches to be truly successful. Though he threw a changeup, Wynn relied almost exclusively on his fastball and did not have any other pitches available at his disposal. Pitching coach Mel Harder, a four-time All-Star with the Indians in the 1930s, taught Wynn how to throw a curveball, slider, and knuckleball; Wynn had the curveball and slider &quot;mastered&quot; by the middle of the 1949 season, according to Fleitz. &quot;I could throw the ball when I came here [to Cleveland],” remembered Wynn, “but Mel made a pitcher out of me.&quot; With Cleveland, he developed into a key part of what Fleitz called &quot;one of the greatest pitching rotations of all time,&quot; joining Feller, Bob Lemon and Mike Garcia. Cleveland manager Al López later called those four pitchers &quot;the greatest pitching staff I ever saw during 33 years in the majors.&quot;

Wynn pitched all 11 innings of a game against the White Sox on May 28, allowing two runs as the Indians prevailed 3–2. On June 3, Wynn held the Red Sox to four hits and one run as the Indians prevailed 8–1. Interestingly, though he was perfecting his new pitches as the 1949 season wore on, Wynn had more success earlier in the year. He had a 7–1 record with a 3.60 ERA through July 17; thereafter, he posted a 4–6 record with a 4.62 ERA. On August 2, he held his former team to one run in an 8–1 victory. Wynn&#x27;s 23 starts were his fewest in a season not interrupted by military service since 1941; he posted an 11–7 record and a 4.15 ERA.

By 1950, Wynn was the number two starter in Cleveland&#x27;s rotation, behind Lemon and ahead of Feller (third). From June 16 through July 9, he won six straight appearances, including a game on July 9 in which he pitched five shutout innings of relief. Wynn struck out a season-high 11 batters on July 6 in a 5–2 win over the White Sox. He limited the Tigers to two runs over 10 innings on August 14 in a 3–2 victory. Five days later, he held the White Sox to three hits and no runs in a 1–0 triumph. He shut out the White Sox again in his last start of the year on September 26, allowing six hits in a 2–0 victory. In 1950, he recorded 18 wins and led the AL with a 3.20 ERA, the highest of any player to lead the league in that category. Wynn also surpassed the 100-strikeout mark for the first time, finishing the year with 143. 1950 was the first of seven straight seasons in which Wynn would win at least 17 games.

On April 18, 1951, Wynn held the Tigers to two runs in 10 innings, earning the win in a 4–2 victory. Though he had a 3.62 ERA through June 17, Wynn&#x27;s record was merely 4–8; he won 16 games after that date to earn his first 20-win season. On July 14, he held the Yankees to two hits and threw a shutout in an 8–0 victory. Five days later, Boston scored four runs against him in 11 innings, but Cleveland rallied from a 4–3 deficit in the 11th to win 5–4. In the first game of a doubleheader on August 19, he shut out the White Sox in a 4–0 victory. On August 28, he held the Athletics scoreless in a 1–0 victory. The victory started a streak of six straight decisions won by Wynn, lasting until his loss to the White Sox on September 25. Wynn tied for the AL lead in starts (34) and led the league with innings pitched, finishing tied for fourth with 20 wins (along with Ned Garver and teammate Garcia), third in ERA (3.02, behind Saul Rogovin&#x27;s 2.78 and Eddie Lopat&#x27;s 2.91), and second in strikeouts (133, behind only Vic Raschi&#x27;s 164). He finished 16th in AL MVP voting.
Wynn made his first Opening Day start as an Indian in 1952. He held Boston to four hits on June 5, striking out eight batters as the Indians won 5–0. In the first game of a doubleheader against Detroit on July 4, he allowed just two hits as Cleveland won 11–0. Wynn was 16–9 through August 15, but he lost three appearances in a row to fall to 16–12 on August 24. He would not lose another game in 1952, winning all seven of his final starts. On September 5, he held the White Sox to four hits in a 3–0 victory. He shut out the Red Sox again on September 12, holding them to three hits in a 5–0 triumph. Wynn finished the year among AL leaders in several categories. He allowed the most home runs (23) and walks (132) of any AL pitcher, but his 2.90 ERA ranked tenth. His 23 wins ranked second to Bobby Shantz&#x27;s 24, and his 153 strikeouts were topped only by Allie Reynolds&#x27;s 160. This season, Wynn finished fifth in AL MVP voting.

In 1953, Wynn was the fourth starter in the Indians&#x27; rotation. In the first game of a doubleheader against the Senators on May 3, he allowed just three hits in a 7–0 shutout victory, striking out eight and also hitting a home run against Connie Marrero. On June 28, he held the Yankees to three hits and one run, hitting a home run against Tom Gorman in a 4–1 victory over the Yankees. Against the Yankees again on July 23, he struck out seven and allowed two runs in a 10–2 victory. He recorded 10 strikeouts in eight innings against the Red Sox on September 1, allowing three runs as the Indians won 13–3. In 36 games (34 starts), he had a 17–12 record and a 3.93 ERA. His 17 wins ranked ninth in the AL, and his 138 strikeouts ranked third (behind Billy Pierce&#x27;s 186 and Virgil Trucks&#x27;s 149).

Wynn made the Opening Day start for the Indians in 1954, his last of two he would make during his tenure with the team. On May 1, he held the Yankees to two runs and drove in two runs himself with an RBI single against Gorman as the Indians prevailed 10–2. Wynn held the Tigers to two hits on May 28 in a 3–0 victory. On July 15, he held the Athletics to three hits in a 4–0 shutout victory. He threw a second shutout against Detroit on August 18, allowing six hits in a 4–0 victory. In the second game of a doubleheader against New York on September 12, he struck out 12 Yankees in a 3–2 victory. Wynn finished the season with a 2.73 ERA (fourth in the AL), won 23 games (most in the AL) and struck out 155 batters (second to Bob Turley&#x27;s 185). He led the AL in starts and innings pitched and finished sixth in MVP voting. The Indians won 111 regular season games during 1954, breaking an AL record previously held by the 1927 New York Yankees and earning Wynn his first playoff appearance. In the 1954 World Series against the New York Giants, Wynn started Game 2. He allowed three runs in seven innings, as the Giants defeated the Indians 3–1. That was Wynn&#x27;s only appearance in the series, as the Giants won four straight games against Cleveland.
Afflicted by pneumonia to begin the 1955 season, Wynn did not earn his first win until May. On May 22, he threw a shutout against the Tigers, allowing just one hit when Fred Hatfield singled in the fourth inning. On June 22, he struck out 10 batters in a 5–0 shutout victory over the Baltimore Orioles. Four days later, in the first game of a doubleheader, he recorded eight strikeouts and allowed just three hits in a 5–0 victory over the Yankees. On July 1, he threw a third shutout in a row as the Indians defeated the White Sox 1–0. He was an All-Star for the second time in his career and pitched three scoreless innings in the game. This selection marked the start of eight consecutive All-Star Games he would be selected to over the next six seasons. He finished the 1955 season with a 17–11 record and a 2.82 ERA. Wynn&#x27;s 17 wins were tied with Turley for fourth in the AL (three pitchers had 18), his 2.82 ERA was third (behind Pierce&#x27;s 1.97 and Whitey Ford&#x27;s 2.63), and his 122 strikeouts ranked seventh. Also, his six shutouts were tied with Pierce and Turley for second, behind Billy Hoeft&#x27;s seven. That season, Wynn began writing a column for &quot;The Cleveland News&quot; entitled &quot;The Wynn Mill&quot;, he did it without any assistance from ghostwriters despite the fact that he had never finished high school. He gave his opinions concerning everything from umpires to Indians coaches, to the frustration of Indians&#x27; general manager Hank Greenberg. Wynn donated his payment for the column to the Elks Club in Nokomis, Florida, where he lived during the offseason.

Wynn threw a shutout against the Yankees on June 8, 1956, allowing five hits in a 9–0 victory. He shut out the Red Sox on June 21, limiting them to four hits in a 5–0 victory. On July 18, he was struck in the face by a sharp line drive off the bat of Senators shortstop Jose Valdivielso. Replaced by Hank Aguirre on the mound, Wynn lost seven teeth from the impact. The facial wound required 16 stitches. He was pitching again four days later, holding the Orioles to six hits in an 8–0 shutout. On July 31, he shut out the Yankees for the second time that year, allowing three hits in a 5–0 victory. He picked up his 20th win of the year with a ten-inning effort against the Kansas City Athletics in a 4–1 victory. His 20 wins put him in a five-way tie for second in the AL, behind Frank Lary&#x27;s 21. Wynn finished third in ERA (2.72, behind Ford&#x27;s 2.47 and teammate Herb Score&#x27;s 2.53) and seventh with 153 strikeouts. In AL MVP voting, Wynn ranked 13th.

In the first game of a doubleheader against the Tigers on April 28, 1957, Wynn took the loss but allowed just two runs and struck out a season-high 10 hitters. He struck out nine Yankees on June 27 in a 2–0 shutout. Seven days later, he had nine strikeouts again, allowing three hits and one unearned run in a 3–1 triumph over Detroit in the first game of a doubleheader. He struck out nine hitters on August 3 as well but gave up 10 hits and four runs in seven innings of a 5–3 loss to the Yankees. Wynn led the AL with 37 starts, but the 1957 season was his first losing season with Cleveland. His record was just 14–17, and his ERA of 4.31 was his highest as an Indian. He led the league in strikeouts (with a career-high 184), but he also led the league in hits (270) and earned runs (126) allowed. After the season, Wynn and Al Smith were traded to the Chicago White Sox for Minnie Miñoso and Hatfield. The trade reunited him with López, who had managed him with the Indians through the 1956 season.

===Chicago White Sox (1958–1962)===
Wynn&#x27;s new contract with the White Sox forbade him from writing for newspapers (thus ending &quot;The Wynn Mill&quot;), but his salary was raised to make up for lost revenue. In his first start against Cleveland since the trade, Wynn threw a two-hit shutout on May 9, 1958. He held the Orioles scoreless on May 23, the necessary total for the White Sox to prevail 1–0. On June 19, he gave up just two hits against Boston in a 4–0 victory. He threw another two-hit shutout on August 31 in a 3–0 victory over Detroit. He had a winning record on September 9 but lost three of his final four starts to finish the year with a 14–16 record. In 1958, Wynn became the first MLB pitcher to lead his league in strikeouts in consecutive years with different teams (184 with Cleveland, 189 with Chicago). His ERA was 4.13.

Fleitz writes that in 1959, &quot;everything clicked for both Wynn and the White Sox.&quot; He began relying further on the knuckleball, since his fastball was losing velocity. &quot;For years they&#x27;ve been accusing me of throwing it when I didn&#x27;t even know how to hold it ... I can&#x27;t throw as hard as I did six, seven years ago. And I get tired quicker. I find that you can throw the knuckler with a little more effort and no strain&quot;, Wynn said. On May 1, Wynn became the second pitcher in major league history to win a game 1–0 while recording at least ten strikeouts and hitting a home run; Red Ruffing had done the same for the Yankees in 1932. He also allowed just one hit to Boston in the game. Wynn served as the starting pitcher in the first All-Star Game of the year on July 7, allowing one run in three innings and receiving a no-decision as the National League defeated the AL 5–4. He threw back-to-back shutouts on August 9 (second game of a doubleheader) and August 13, allowing three hits in each as the White Sox won both games 9–0. On September 8, he pitched 10 innings, allowing two runs to the Athletics as Chicago prevailed 3–2. Facing the Indians on September 22, Wynn picked up his 21st win, a victory that clinched the AL pennant for the White Sox. Wynn won the Cy Young Award in 1959 at the age of 39, posting a record of 22–10, with 179 strikeouts and a 3.17 ERA. He became the third-oldest MLB pitcher to win 20 games in a season, following Cy Young and Grover Cleveland Alexander. Wynn&#x27;s 22 wins led the AL, his 3.17 ERA ranked ninth, his 179 strikeouts were third (behind Jim Bunning&#x27;s 201 and Camilo Pascual&#x27;s 179), his innings pitched led the league, and his 37 starts tied Paul Foytack for most in the AL. He also ranked second in shutouts with five, one fewer than Pascual&#x27;s total. Wynn was third in AL MVP voting, trailing teammates Nellie Fox and Luis Aparicio.

Wynn was &quot;magnificent&quot; in Game 1 of the 1959 World Series, according to &quot;Sports Illustrated.&quot; He allowed no runs, merely singles, to the Los Angeles Dodgers for seven innings before exiting because the cold weather was affecting his elbow; the White Sox defeated Los Angeles 11–0. In Game 4, he kept the Dodgers scoreless for the first two innings but allowed four runs (three earned) in the third inning before getting replaced with two outs by Turk Lown; the Dodgers won that game 5–4, though Wynn had a no-decision. He gave up a two-run home run to Duke Snider in the third inning of Game 6, then allowed three runs in the fourth inning, taking the loss in the 9–3 defeat as the Dodgers clinched the Series victory in six games.

In the first game of a doubleheader on May 15, 1960, Wynn shut out the Indians, limiting them to five hits in a 4–0 triumph. He lost five straight decisions from May 25 through June 18, but he won 11 of his next 15. In 1960, Wynn was selected to the All-Star Games for his seventh and last year, pitching two scoreless innings in the second All-Star Game, which the AL lost 6–0. On August 19, he shut out the Athletics, allowing seven hits as Chicago defeated Kansas City by a score of 10–0. His final two wins of the season were shutouts thrown within 12 days of each other in September, the first coming in a 1–0 victory over Boston on September 11. He finished the 1960 season with a 13–12 record (his fewest wins since 1949), a 3.49 ERA, and 158 strikeouts, the third-highest total in the AL (behind Bunning&#x27;s 201 and Pedro Ramos&#x27;s 160). Wynn also tied Ford and Jim Perry for the AL lead in shutouts, with four.

Wynn struck out a season-high seven batters in back-to-back wins on May 12 and May 16, 1961. He held Baltimore scoreless and pitched seven shutout innings with six strikeouts on July 22 but received a no-decision; the White Sox won 7–4. In 1961, Wynn was 8–2 but his season ended after the start against the Orioles because his gout, which had affected him since 1950, finally became too much for him to pitch through. He had 64 strikeouts and a 3.51 ERA. Wynn missed the rest of the season, even giving up eating meat in an attempt to get the ailment under control.

By 1962, Wynn had started pitching mainly with the slider and the knuckleball. By that season, he was the oldest player in the AL. Facing the Indians on May 28, he threw a three-hit shutout as Chicago won 2–0. His next win (over a month later) was also a shutout, when he struck out eight batters and allowed only five hits in a 7–0 victory over Cleveland. 24 days later, Wynn had another shutout in a five-hit, 6–0 victory over the Washington Senators. He pitched to a 7–15 record in 1962, with a 4.46 ERA (his highest since 1948) and just 91 strikeouts. The 15 losses were tied with Don Schwall&#x27;s total for fourth in the AL, and his 4.46 ERA was 0.49 over the league average. Thinking he was finished, the White Sox released him after the season.

===1963: The pursuit of win #300===
Wynn, however, had picked up his 299th victory before the end of 1962 and was determined to get to 300 career wins. He attended spring training with the White Sox in 1963 failing to make the team. Several teams offered him one-game contracts, but Wynn held out for a full-time deal, which he got from the Indians on June 21. Cleveland then added him to the starting rotation to give him the opportunities he needed. He failed to win in his first three starts with the Indians that year, and the nine months and seven starts that had elapsed from 1962 to 1963 are still, as of 2025, the longest gap between any pitcher&#x27;s 299th and 300th wins in MLB history.

The night before his fourth start of the year, against the Athletics on July 13, Wynn struggled to sleep due to gout-related pain. In that outing, Wynn finally picked up the milestone. Opposing Kansas City batter Ed Charles recalled Wynn&#x27;s performance: &quot;His fastball, if it reached 80, that was stretching it. He was laboring, throwing nothing but bloopers and junk.&quot; He left the game with a 5–4 lead after pitching five innings. &quot;Jerry Walker relieved me and saved the game for me. He was my roommate and pitched like a man possessed&quot;, Wynn recalled. Long after his retirement, which came at the end of the 1963 season, Wynn reflected on his 300th win stating he was not proud of the milestone. &quot;If I had pitched a good game and gone nine innings, that would be something. But that&#x27;s not the way it was&quot;, Wynn said. He remains one of only 24 pitchers to win 300 games.

Following the 300th win, Wynn made just one more start, a 3–2 win over Kansas City on July 27 (though Wynn received a no-decision because he was removed from the game in the fifth inning). He did make several relief appearances for the Indians before the end of the season. His last of these came on September 13, when he entered a game against the Los Angeles Angels in relief of Jack Kralick with two outs in the sixth inning with runners on first and second. Wynn gave up an RBI single to Jim Fregosi, then got Charlie Dees to line out to shortstop to end the inning. Lifted in favor of pinch-hitter Willie Kirkland in the bottom of the inning, Wynn had pitched his last game. In 20 games (five starts), Wynn had a 1–2 record, a 2.28 ERA, and 29 strikeouts. After the season, he retired.

==Legacy==
Wynn approached the game with passion, sometimes throwing chairs in frustration after losses. He also hated getting removed from games, once throwing a baseball at López when the manager walked to the mound to remove him (though Wynn apologized to López after the game). First afflicted by gout in 1950, he endured pain through much of the second half of his career. Nevertheless, he was the first player to pitch at least 23 seasons in the major leagues, and he appeared in games over four decades. His durability helped him lead the AL in innings three times (1951, 1954, 1959) and propelled him to an AL record for most years pitched (23). Wynn won an even 300 games, 23rd most by any major leaguer. He registered five 20-win seasons, 2,334 strikeouts, 290 complete games, 49 shutouts, and 4,556 innings pitched in 691 games.

In the 1950s, Wynn had more strikeouts (1,544) than any other pitcher in the major leagues. He was one of the best hitting pitchers of his day as well. A switch hitter, Wynn batted .214 (365-for-1,704), with 17 home runs and 173 RBI. His 90 pinch-hit appearances included a grand slam (which he hit with the Senators on September 15, 1946), making him one of five MLB pitchers to record a grand slam as a pinch-hitter.

As of 2025, Wynn still ranks among the Indians&#x27; career leaders in many categories. He is fifth in wins (164), tied for fourth in strikeouts (1,277, equal to Lemon&#x27;s total), seventh in shutouts (24), and seventh in total games started (296). In 1999, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; ranked Wynn number 100 on their list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players.

==Later life==
Wynn remained with the Indians following retirement, becoming their pitching coach in 1964. Several of his players – including Sam McDowell, Sonny Siebert, Luis Tiant and Steve Hargan – were still with the team in 1967 when they set a record for team strikeouts in a season with 1189. Tommy John considered him &quot;abrasive&quot; and not &quot;very informative or helpful,&quot; though Wynn did teach John how to throw a slider. In August 1965, Wynn flirted with the idea of making a comeback as a knuckleball pitcher. Wynn left Cleveland after the 1966 season and joined the Minnesota Twins as pitching coach. He later served as a minor league manager for the Twins. Off the field, Wynn advocated for better pensions for retired baseball players.

Wynn proposed the idea of a one-game comeback to the Twins in 1970. In 1972, the Twins considered activating the 52-year-old Wynn to pitch one inning if retired star Ted Williams would hit against him. The move would have made Wynn the first player to pitch in five different decades, but Williams was not interested and the team dropped the idea. Williams called him &quot;the toughest pitcher I ever faced.&quot;

In 1972, Wynn was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame along with Sandy Koufax and Yogi Berra. He was disappointed that he had not received the required votes on his first three ballots, but he was grateful for the honor. &quot;I&#x27;d been hoping for it, but I didn&#x27;t want to build up my hopes too high,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#x27;s like being placed up there on a pedestal, not like getting a gold watch for your longtime efforts. It&#x27;s recognition I was waiting for a long time.&quot; He was inducted as a member of the Indians on his plaque.

From their inaugural 1977 season through the end of the 1981 season, Wynn provided the color commentary for radio broadcasts of Toronto Blue Jays games, working alongside Tom Cheek. He also provided color commentary for Chicago White Sox radio broadcasts in 1982 and 1983, paired with Joe McConnell. When he was replaced by Lorn Brown in December 1983, White Sox president Eddie Einhorn described Wynn as &quot;a link to baseball&#x27;s past.&quot;

In the last years of his life, Wynn suffered a heart attack and a stroke. His health had declined after the death of his second wife in 1994. He moved to an assisted living facility in Venice, Florida, where he died in April 1999. Wynn&#x27;s body was cremated, and his family kept his ashes.

In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Wynn as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Army during World War II.

==Personal life==
Wynn married Mabel Allman in 1939. She was killed in a car accident in 1942. They had one child together, son Joe, whom Wynn&#x27;s relatives helped to raise after Mabel&#x27;s death. In the fall of 1944, just after entering the Army, Wynn married his second wife, Lorraine Follin. They later had a daughter, Sherry. Early and Lorraine resided in Nokomis, Florida. Wynn had several hobbies, including flying his Cessna 170, hunting, and operating powerboats. In the 1960s, he owned the Early Wynn Steak House and Bowling Lanes in Venice, Florida.

==Toughness==
Wynn was remembered for his toughness and for the frequency with which he threw at batters. He once stated, &quot;I&#x27;d knock down my own grandmother if she dug in on me.&quot; He also said to reporters: &quot;Why should I worry about hitters? Do they worry about me? Do you ever find a hitter crying because he&#x27;s hit a line drive through the box? My job is getting hitters out. If I don&#x27;t get them out I lose. I don&#x27;t like losing a game any more than a salesman likes losing a big sale. I&#x27;ve got a right to knock down anybody holding a bat.&quot; When he was then asked whether he would have the same opinion if the batter were his own mother, he paused, then responded, &quot;Mother was a pretty good curveball hitter.&quot;

In fact, when Wynn was with the Indians, he actually threw a pitch at his own 15-year-old son, Joe. Wynn was throwing pre-game batting practice to Joe, and Joe hit two long drives in a row. Ushers in the nearly empty stadium began to clap. Moments later, Joe was lying flat on his back in the batting cage, frightened by his father&#x27;s knockdown pitch. Wynn said later, &quot;He was leaning in on me, and I had to show him who was boss.&quot;

His attitude was encouraged early in his career by manager Bucky Harris, who ordered Wynn to throw brushback pitches when he got two strikes on a batter. Otherwise he faced a $25 fine. &quot;I was making $350 a month. I couldn&#x27;t afford giving up $25&quot;, Wynn said. Whenever an opposing batter lined one of his pitches back toward the mound, Wynn would retaliate by throwing a brushback pitch at the batter the next time the batter faced him. &quot;That space between the white lines – that&#x27;s my office, that&#x27;s where I conduct my business,” he said in an interview with sportswriter Red Smith. “You take a look at the batter&#x27;s box, and part of it belongs to the hitter. But when he crowds in just that hair, he&#x27;s stepping into my office, and nobody comes into my office without an invitation when I&#x27;m going to work.&quot;

In 1962, when Wynn was with the White Sox, he was throwing batting practice and his teammate Joe Cunningham hit a line drive that missed Wynn by inches. Wynn responded by throwing three straight pitches under his teammate&#x27;s chin. Whenever one of his teammates was knocked down by an opposing pitcher, Wynn would retaliate by knocking down two of the opposing pitcher&#x27;s teammates. According to Minnesota Twins player Rod Carew, Wynn&#x27;s competitiveness did not end when his playing career did. As the Twins pitching coach from 1967 to 1969, &quot;Early would knock you down in batting practice. If you hit a ball good off of him, he&#x27;d knock you down and then challenge you. He told you to expect it when you stepped in the cage against him.&quot;

<text>Forest Glen station is a side platformed Washington Metro station in Forest Glen, Maryland, United States. The station was opened on September 22, 1990, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail north of the Silver Spring station and the opening of Wheaton. Providing service for the Red Line, the station is located at Georgia Avenue (Maryland Route 97) and Forest Glen Road. The station is the deepest in the system and the state of Maryland at deep, so high-speed elevators, rather than escalators, are used for access to the surface.

==History==
The original plan was to build the station above ground, with a parking lot that would have required demolishing about fifteen homes. After community opposition to the above-ground station, Montgomery County approved a modified plan for an underground station.

The originally planned location for the parking lot and bus stops was on the east side of Georgia Avenue, between Sherwood Road and Tilton Drive, near Woodland Drive. Tilton Drive would have been closed between Georgia Avenue and Woodland Drive in order to reduce traffic through the nearby residential neighborhood. Building the parking lot and bus stops there would have required the demolition of one business and several homes.

Response to plans for the underground station were mixed, with some residents and local businesses looking forward to the convenience of a nearby station and other residents concerned about potential increases in traffic in the area. Metro contended that deleting the station from the plans altogether would have overloaded both Wheaton and Silver Spring metro stations. The Montgomery County council approved the station in January 1976, three months after it had approved the further-away Wheaton station.

On August 13, 1991, all six elevators broke down due to a malfunctioning fire sensor, blocking access to and from the station for several hours.

On June 1, 2024, all Red Line stations north of Fort Totten, including this one were closed to allow the Maryland Transit Authority to work on the upcoming Purple Line. Takoma re-opened on June 29 while the rest of the stations re-opened on September 1st 2024.

==Layout==
Building the tunnels through soft rock close to the surface would have been either very costly or impossible, so engineers decided to dig the tunnels through harder, more solid rock deeper in the ground. Due to tracks resting at a depth of , Forest Glen is the only station in the system without direct surface access by way of escalators. Instead, a bank of six high-speed elevators serve the station, with each elevator able to travel at a rate of between the underground station and the surface. Because of the lack of escalators, Forest Glen is the only station equipped with smoke doors to protect customers during a train fire and evacuation. In addition, a 20-story staircase exists for emergency use. South of this station, trains emerge from the tunnel.

This station, along with Wheaton station farther north and Fort Totten&#x27;s lower level, has separate tunnels and platforms for each direction, instead of the large, vaulted common room seen at most other underground stations in the Metro system; this design, which is similar to many of the London Underground&#x27;s tube stations, was used to save money due to the station&#x27;s depth.

==After Boxing==
After retiring, Watkins went back to Texas to work as a fumigator. In 2003, the American military, needing personnel to work rebuilding Iraq&#x27;s infrastructure, contracted him as a fumigator to work on Iraqi homes that had been decaying and infected with insects during Saddam Hussein&#x27;s presidency.

In 2008, writer Suzy Pepper, a former neighbor of Maurice Watkins, released &quot;Termite&quot;, a biographical book about Watkins. Also in 2008, a movie based on the book was announced.

==In Iraq==
After the IOC announced that Iraq would be allowed to compete in seven sports at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, including boxing, the United States military set about to find a new boxing coach for the Iraqi national boxing team. With research, they found out about Watkins&#x27; background, and invited him to coach a team of young hopefuls in Baghdad. Realizing he needed to train the team in a setting different from Baghdad, he moved his team to a city close to Baghdad, but much quieter than the capital city. He trained nine Iraqi boxers who hoped to reach the Olympics, but only Najah Ali was able to qualify for the games.

<doc id="560899" wikidata="Q927300" url="?curid=560899" title="Duke of Leeds">
<text>Duke of Leeds was a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1694 for the prominent statesman Thomas Osborne, 1st Marquess of Carmarthen, who had been one of the Immortal Seven in the Revolution of 1688. He had already succeeded as 2nd Baronet, of Kiveton (1647) and been created Viscount Osborne, of Dunblane (1673), Baron Osborne, of Kiveton in the County of York (also 1673) and Viscount Latimer, of Danby in the County of York (also 1673), Earl of Danby, in the County of York (1674), and Marquess of Carmarthen (1689). All these titles were in the Peerage of England, except for the viscountcy of Osborne, which was in the Peerage of Scotland. He resigned the latter title in favour of his son in 1673. The Earldom of Danby was a revival of the title held by his great-uncle, Henry Danvers, 1st Earl of Danby (see Earl of Danby).

==History==
The Dukedom was named for Leeds in Yorkshire, and did not (as is sometimes claimed) refer to Leeds Castle in Kent. The principal ducal seat was Kiveton Hall. After Kiveton Hall was demolished in 1811, Hornby Castle became the main seat of the Dukes of Leeds. The traditional burial place of the Dukes of Leeds was All Hallows Church, Harthill, South Yorkshire.

The 4th Duke married Mary Godolphin, daughter of Henrietta Churchill Godolphin, &quot;suo jure&quot; Duchess of Marlborough, and The 2nd Earl of Godolphin, and assumed the arms of Godolphin and Churchill.

On 8 August 1849, The 7th Duke of Leeds assumed by royal licence the additional surname and arms of D&#x27;Arcy, for the separate baronies of D&#x27;Arcy (1322) and Conyers that he inherited through his grandmother.

Upon the death of the 7th Duke in 1859, the dukedom passed to his cousin, The 2nd Baron Godolphin, whose father (the second son of The 5th Duke of Leeds) had been created Baron Godolphin, of Farnham Royal in the County of Buckingham, in 1832.

The 11th Duke was married three times; he had a daughter, Lady Camilla Osborne, but no son. Upon his death in 1963, the dukedom passed to his cousin, Sir D&#x27;Arcy Osborne, a diplomat. Eight months later, the 12th Duke died in Rome, unmarried, at which point the dukedom and the Barony of Godolphin became extinct.

The heir apparent to the Duke of Leeds was styled &quot;Marquess of Carmarthen&quot;; Lord Carmarthen&#x27;s heir apparent was styled &quot;Earl of Danby&quot;; and Lord Danby&#x27;s heir apparent was styled &quot;Viscount Latimer&quot;.

<doc id="560903" wikidata="Q7991952" url="?curid=560903" title="Wheaton station (Washington Metro)">
<text>Wheaton station is a Washington Metro station in Montgomery County, Maryland on the Red Line. The station serves the suburb of Wheaton, and is located at the intersection of Georgia Avenue (Maryland Route 97) and Reedie Drive. The station contains escalators, which are the longest set of single-span escalators in the Western Hemisphere.

Service at Wheaton began on September 22, 1990, and it was the northeastern end of the Red Line for nearly eight years, until Glenmont opened in July 1998.

On June 1, 2024, all Red Line stations north of Fort Totten, including this one were closed to allow the Maryland Transit Authority to work on the upcoming Purple Line. Takoma re-opened on June 29 while the rest of the stations re-opened on September 1st, 2024.

==Station layout==

Wheaton station features the longest set of single-span escalators in the Western Hemisphere, each featuring a length of , with a vertical rise of . Wheaton&#x27;s escalators travel at a speed of per minute (±5%) and are set at an inclination of 30 degrees. The trip takes approximately 2 minutes and 45 seconds. There are two elevators leading into the station&#x27;s parking garage at the Reedie Drive entrance, while the entrance at the bus bay is at ground level. Inside the station, there is one elevator leading from the mezzanine to the Shady Grove bound side of the platform. The station is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. However, the station lacks backup elevators. In the event that the elevator to the platform is not operational, the station is not accessible and disabled users must take a shuttle to the next station.

This station, along with Forest Glen farther south and Fort Totten&#x27;s lower level, has separate tunnels and platforms for each direction, instead of the large, vaulted common room seen at most other underground stations in the Metro system; this design was used to save money due to the station&#x27;s depth.

<doc id="560904" wikidata="Q3735133" url="?curid=560904" title="Lord Frederick Windsor">
<text>Lord Frederick Michael George David Louis Windsor (born 6 April 1979) is a member of the British royal family. He is the only son of Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, and is 54th in the line of succession to the British throne. He is married to British actress Sophie Winkleman and is a financial analyst by profession. As a great-grandchild of King George V and Queen Mary, he is a second cousin of King Charles III.

==Early life and education==
Lord Frederick Windsor was born on 6 April 1979 at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, London, and christened on 11 July 1979 at the Chapel Royal, St James&#x27;s Palace, Westminster. A first cousin once removed of the late Queen Elizabeth II, a first cousin twice removed of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, making him both a second cousin and second cousin once removed of King Charles III and his siblings, he is 53rd in the line of succession to the British throne. 

Lord Frederick and his sister, Lady Gabriella, were brought up in the Church of England. 

He was educated at Wetherby School, Sunningdale, and Eton College, where he was an Oppidan Scholar, then at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he gained a 2:1 degree in Classics.

==Career==
After graduation, Lord Frederick worked as a fashion model for a campaign by Burberry and for the designer Tomasz Starzewski and also as a music journalist, notably for &quot;Tatler&quot; magazine. He planned to become a solicitor specializing in entertainment law, but by September 2006, according to &quot;The Times&quot;, he was working as an analyst in the wealth management arm of JP Morgan in London. 
He is now a banker and executive director at JPMorgan Chase and is a CFA charterholder, having received his charter in 2013.

==Personal life==
On St Valentine&#x27;s Day (14 February) 2009, Lord Frederick became engaged to the actress Sophie Winkleman. The Queen consented to the marriage, as required by the Royal Marriages Act 1772, and they were married at Hampton Court on 12 September 2009.

The couple&#x27;s first child, Maud Elizabeth Daphne Marina, was born at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center on 15 August 2013 in Los Angeles. She was baptised at St James&#x27;s Palace in December 2013, and has Princess Eugenie among her godparents. Maud acted as a bridesmaid at the wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank in 2018.

On 20 January 2016, it was announced Lord and Lady Frederick Windsor had become parents to a second daughter, Isabella Alexandra May, born on 16 January 2016 at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London. She was baptised at Kensington Palace in June 2016 with Jamie Oliver, a close friend of her mother, serving as one of the godparents.

From September 2016 until its closure in 2023, Lord Frederick was president of the charity Soldier On!, which supported vulnerable, disadvantaged, or socially isolated people by participating in archaeology and heritage projects as well as personal development workshops.

On 21 February 2017, Lord Frederick was inducted into the Grand Order of Water Rats charitable fraternity.

==Titles and styles==
Under letters patent issued in 1917 and still in force today, Lord Frederick&#x27;s father is entitled to the dignity of prince and the style &quot;His Royal Highness&quot; as the son of a son of George V. Although these letters do not bestow these royal dignities beyond grandchildren of monarchs (except in the case of the children of the Prince of Wales, as modified by Elizabeth II), they allow the children of sons of sons of a British monarch to be styled as the children of a duke, with the honorific courtesy style of Lord or Lady before their given names. Since Lord Frederick is not a peer in his own right, his style is not hereditary and his children are not entitled to any distinctions, including the prefix The Honourable. They do, however, follow him in the line of succession to the British throne.

==Honours==
* 6 February 2002: Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal
* 6 February 2012: Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal
* 6 February 2022: Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Medal
* 6 May 2023: King Charles III Coronation Medal

<text>TightVNC is a free and open-source remote desktop software server and client application for Linux and Windows. A server for macOS is available under a commercial source code license only, without SDK or binary version provided. Constantin Kaplinsky developed TightVNC, using and extending the RFB protocol of Virtual Network Computing (VNC) to allow end-users to control another computer&#x27;s screen remotely.

==Encodings==
TightVNC uses so-called &quot;tight encoding&quot; of areas, which improves performance over low bandwidth connection. It is effectively a combination of the JPEG and zlib compression mechanisms. It is possible to watch videos and play DirectX games through TightVNC over a broadband connection, albeit at a low frame rate.

TightVNC includes many other common features of VNC derivatives, such as file transfer capability.

==Compatibility==
TightVNC is cross-compatible with other client and server implementations of VNC; however, tight encoding is not supported by most other implementations, so it is necessary to use TightVNC at both ends to gain the full advantage of its enhancements.

Among notable enhancements are file transfers, support for the DemoForge DFMirage mirror driver (a type of virtual display driver) to detect screen updates (saves CPU time and increases the performance of TightVNC), ability to zoom the picture and automatic SSH tunneling on Unix.

Since the 2.0 beta, TightVNC supports auto scaling, which resizes the viewer window to the remote users desktop size, regardless of the resolution of the host computer.

TightVNC 1.3.10, released in March 2009, is the last version to support Linux/Unix. This version is still often used in guides to set up VNC for Linux.

==Derived software==

===RemoteVNC===
RemoteVNC is a fork of the TightVNC project and adds automatic traversal of NAT and firewalls using Jingle. It requires a GMail account.

===TightVNC Portable Edition===
The developers have also produced a portable version of the software, available as both U3 and standalone downloads.

===TurboVNC===
TurboVNC is based on the TightVNC 1.3.x, xf4vnc, X.org, and TigerVNC code bases and includes numerous performance enhancements and features targeted at 3D and video workloads.

===TigerVNC===
TigerVNC is VNC server and client software, started as a fork of TightVNC in 2009, after three years of inactivity in TightVNC trunk. It also takes some code from TurboVNC.

<text>RealVNC is a company that provides remote access software. Their VNC Connect software consists of a server (VNC Server) and client (VNC Viewer) application, which exchange data over the RFB protocol to allow the Viewer to control the Server&#x27;s screen remotely. The application is used, for example, by IT support engineers to provide helpdesk services to remote users.

==History==
Andy Harter and other members of the original VNC team at AT&amp;T founded RealVNC Limited in 2002. The automotive division of RealVNC spun out as a separate company (VNC Automotive) in 2018.

==Platforms, editions, versions==
For a desktop-to-desktop connection RealVNC runs on Windows, macOS, and many Unix-like operating systems. A list of supported platforms can be found on the website. A RealVNC client also runs on the Java platform and on the Apple iPhone, iPod touch and iPad and Google Android devices. 

A Windows-only client, VNC Viewer Plus was launched in 2010, designed to interface to the embedded server on Intel AMT chipsets found on Intel vPro motherboards. RealVNC removed VNC Viewer Plus from sale on 28th February 2021.

For remote access to view one computer desktop on another, RealVNC requires one of three subscriptions:
# Home – free registration and activation required
# Professional – commercial version geared towards home or small-business users, with authentication and encryption, remote printing, chat and file transfer
# Enterprise – commercial version geared towards enterprises, with enhanced authentication and encryption, remote printing, chat, file transfer, and command-line deployment

As of release 4.3 (released August 2007), separate versions of both the Personal and Enterprise editions exist for 32-bit and 64-bit systems. Release 4.6 included features such as HTTP proxy support, chat, an address book, remote printing, unicode support, and connection notification.

Users must activate each of the server versions (&quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Professional&quot;, &quot;Enterprise&quot;).

With the release of VNC 5.0 late December 2013, RealVNC software editions used a single binary which superseded VNC Enterprise Edition and VNC Personal Edition.

In November 2016, RealVNC released the updated version of their software, now called VNC Connect (version 6.0). The new version introduces a cloud connection option using a subscription-based pricing model. Users can choose between three subscription levels; Home (free for non-commercial use), Professional and Enterprise. Home and Professional subscriptions are cloud connections only. The Enterprise subscription supports hybrid connections that include the traditional direct (peer to peer) connections and/or cloud connections.

==Client (VNC Viewer)==
RealVNC clients using codice_1 can run in full-screen mode; they use the F8 function-key as the default key for bringing up an options menu (which includes the option to, among other things, switch off full screen mode or to forward a Control-Alt-Delete key-sequence).

==Server (VNC Server)==
The server component of RealVNC allows a computer to be remotely controlled by another computer.

==Connectivity==
RealVNC uses the RFB protocol. RFB 6.0 defaults to TCP/UDP port 5900. When making a connection over the Internet, the user must open this port in the local firewall as well as configure port forwarding to forward TCP Port 5900 (or the customized port respectively) to the local machine address if behind a NAT Router.

As an alternative, one can tunnel VNC through SSH, avoiding the opening of additional ports and automatically traversing the NAT router. SSH also provides encryption of the connection between the VNC server and viewer.

After proposing remote access interface for Weston in October 2013, RealVNC published a Wayland developer preview in July 2014.

==Limitations==
The VNC protocol is pixel-based. Although this leads to great flexibility (e.g., any type of desktop can be displayed), it is often less efficient than solutions that have a better understanding of the underlying graphic layout, like X11. Those protocols send graphic primitives or high-level commands in a simpler form (e.g., open window), whereas RFB just sends the raw pixel data.

<doc id="560912" wikidata="Q5313044" url="?curid=560912" title="Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull">
<text>Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull was a title in the Peerage of Great Britain, with the title Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull being a title in the Peerage of England. The earldom was created on 25 July 1628 for Robert Pierrepont, 1st Viscount Newark. The dukedom was created on 10 August 1715 for his great-grandson, Evelyn Pierrepont, 1st Marquess of Dorchester, who had succeeded as the fifth Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull in 1690. The dukedom became extinct on the death of the second Duke in 1773. Unlike the city to which they refer, Kingston upon Hull, which is usually shortened to Hull, these titles are usually shortened to Duke (or Earl) of Kingston. (The titles were hyphenated but the city is now usually written without hyphens). They should not be confused with the separate Irish Earldom of Kingston (which refers to the town of Kingston in County Dublin).

==History==
From the 13th century, the seat of the Pierrepont family had been Holme Pierrepont Hall, Nottinghamshire. This was to move during the sixteenth century to Thoresby Hall, also in Nottinghamshire. Several members of the family had served in the 15th and 16th centuries as High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. The direct forebear of the Dukes and Earls of Kingson-upon-Hull was Sir Henry Pierrepont who represented Nottinghamshire in Parliament. He had married Frances Cavendish, daughter and eldest child of Sir William Cavendish and Bess of Hardwick.

Sir Henry Pierrepont&#x27;s son, Sir Robert Pierrepont, was created Viscount Newark and Baron Pierrepont in the Peerage of England on 29 June 1627. In 1628 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull with a remainder to heirs general, also in the Peerage of England. Robert Pierrepont had married Gertrude Talbot in 1601. She was a granddaughter of George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury, and through him, all their descendants are able to claim descent from Edward III, through Edward&#x27;s younger son, Thomas of Woodstock.

The first Earl was succeeded by his son, Henry Pierrepont, who was himself created Marquess of Dorchester in 1645. He died without heirs in 1660, and this marquessate became extinct. The earldom and other titles devolved on his nephew, Robert, the third Earl, the eldest son of the Honourable William Pierrepont, second son of the first Earl. Robert died unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother, William, the fourth Earl. William was in his turn succeeded by his younger brother, the aforementioned Evelyn, the fifth Earl. He was created Marquess of Dorchester in the Peerage of England in 1706, a revival of the title held by his uncle, and later created Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1715, with these titles becoming extinct on the death of the first Duke&#x27;s grandson, Evelyn, the second Duke, in 1773. On the death of the second Duke&#x27;s wife, the estates of the Dukes of Kingston-upon-Hull passed to Charles Medows. He was a great-grandson of the first Duke through the female line. He changed his surname to Pierrepont, and was created Viscount Newark, and Baron Pierrepont, of Holme Pierrepont in 1796 and later created Earl Manvers in 1806. These titles became extinct on the death of the sixth Earl Manvers in 1955.

Several other members of the family have also gained distinction. The Honourable William Pierrepont, second son of the first Earl, was a politician. His third son Gervase Pierrepont was created Baron Pierrepont in 1701. Lady Mary Pierrepont, better known as Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, daughter of the first Duke, was a writer, and introduced smallpox inoculation to Western medicine after witnessing it during her travels and stay in the Ottoman Empire. Elizabeth Pierrepont, Duchess of Kingston-upon-Hull, wife of the second Duke, was a courtier.

<doc id="560914" wikidata="Q115728" url="?curid=560914" title="The Madonna of Port Lligat">
<text>The Madonna of Port Lligat is a pair of paintings by Salvador Dalí. The first was created in 1949, measuring 49 x 37.5 centimetres (19.3 x 14.8 in), and is housed in the Haggerty Museum of Art at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA. Dalí presented it to Pope Pius XII in an audience for approval, which was granted. Dalí created a second painting in 1950 with the same title and same themes, with various poses and details changed, measuring 275.3 x 209.8 centimetres (108.4 x 82.6 in). The 1950 Madonna is exhibited at the Fukuoka Art Museum in Japan.

==Description==
The paintings depict a seated Madonna (posed by Dalí&#x27;s wife, Gala) with the infant Christ on her lap. Both figures have rectangular holes cut into their torsos, suggestive of their transcendent status. In the 1950 version Christ has bread at the center of his figure. They are posed in a landscape, with features of the coast of Portlligat, Catalonia, in the background. Several surrealist details are included: nails, fish, seashells, and an egg. The 1949 Madonna has a sea urchin; the 1950 Madonna has a rhinoceros and figures of angels, also posed by Gala.

==Cultural references==
A poem and book based on the painting, &quot;The Virgin of Port Lligat&quot;, by Fray Angelico Chavez, was selected as one of the best books of 1959 by the Catholic Library Association.

In Larry Niven&#x27;s 1973 novel &quot;Protector&quot;, one of the main characters has this painting on his spacesuit.

<doc id="560920" wikidata="Q3277319" url="?curid=560920" title="Kaʻiulani">
<text>Princess Kaʻiulani (; Victoria Kawēkiu Kaʻiulani Lunalilo Kalaninuiahilapalapa Cleghorn; October 16, 1875 – March 6, 1899) was a Hawaiian royal, the only child of Princess Miriam Likelike, and the last heir apparent to the throne of the Hawaiian Kingdom. She was the niece of King Kalākaua and Queen Liliʻuokalani. After the death of her mother, Princess Kaʻiulani was sent to Europe at age 13 to complete her education under the guardianship of British businessman and Hawaiian sugar investor Theo H. Davies. She had not yet reached her eighteenth birthday when the 1893 overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom altered her life. The Committee of Safety rejected proposals from both her father Archibald Scott Cleghorn, and provisional president Sanford B. Dole, to seat Kaʻiulani on the throne, conditional upon the abdication of Liliʻuokalani. The Queen thought the Kingdom&#x27;s best chance at justice was to relinquish her power temporarily to the United States.

Davies and Kaʻiulani visited the United States to urge the Kingdom&#x27;s restoration; she made speeches and public appearances denouncing the overthrow of her government and the injustice toward her people. While in Washington, D.C. she paid an informal visit to President Grover Cleveland and First Lady Frances Cleveland, but her efforts were in vain. The situation put both Kaʻiulani and her father in dire financial straits. Her annual government stipend ceased, and her father&#x27;s income as a government employee came to an end. Father and daughter spent the years 1893–1897 drifting among the European aristocracy, relatives and family friends in England, Wales, Scotland and Paris, before finally returning to Hawaii.

After arriving back in Hawaii in 1897, Kaʻiulani settled into life as a private citizen and busied herself with social engagements. She and Liliʻuokalani boycotted the 1898 annexation ceremony and mourned the loss of Hawaiian independence. However, she later hosted the American congressional delegation in charge of formalizing the Hawaiian Organic Act. She suffered from chronic health problems throughout the 1890s and died at her home at ʻĀinahau in 1899.

== Name ==
Kaʻiulani was born at Honolulu, on the island of Oʻahu, in the Hawaiian Kingdom. At her christening, she was named &quot;Victoria Kawēkiu Kaʻiulani Lunalilo Kalaninuiahilapalapa Cleghorn&quot;. In 1898, her aunt Liliʻuokalani wrote it as &quot;Victoria Kaʻiulani, Kalaninuiahilapalapa, Kawēkiu i Lunalilo&quot; or &quot;Victoria Kawēkiu Lunalilo Kalaninuiahilapalapa Kaʻiulani Cleghorn&quot; in her memoir &quot;Hawaii&#x27;s Story by Hawaii&#x27;s Queen&quot;. Kaʻiulani was named after her maternal aunt Anna Kaʻiulani who died young, and Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, whose help restored the sovereignty and independence of the Hawaiian Kingdom during the reign of Kamehameha III. Her primary Hawaiian name comes from &quot;ka ʻiu lani&quot; which means or &quot;the royal sacred one&quot; in the Hawaiian language. Kawēkiu means &quot;the highest rank or station&quot;. At the request of Charles Kanaʻina, she was also given the name Lunalilo, translated as &quot;Luna&quot; (high) &quot;lilo&quot; (lost) or &quot;so high up as to be lost to sight&quot;, after Kanaʻina&#x27;s son and her uncle King Kalākaua&#x27;s predecessor King Lunalilo (r. 1873–74) to strengthen her eligibility for the throne. The name &quot;Kalaninuiahilapalapa&quot; signified her association with the royal house of Keawe (traditional rulers of the island of Hawaii) and the flames of the torch that burns at midday, a symbol of &quot;kapu&quot;, used by the House of Kalākaua from their ancestor Iwikauikaua.

== Early life and family: 1875–1887 ==

Kaʻiulani was the only child of Princess Miriam Likelike and Scottish businessman Archibald Scott Cleghorn. She was born in a downstairs bedroom of her parents&#x27; Emma Street mansion in Honolulu, on October 16, 1875, during the reign of her uncle King Kalākaua. Her birth was announced by gun salutes and the ringing of all of the bells in the city&#x27;s churches. At the time of her birth, she became fourth in line of succession to the throne, moving to third in the line of succession upon the death of her uncle Leleiohoku II in 1877. She had three older half-sisters: Rose Kaipuala, Helen Maniʻiailehua, and Annie Pauahi, from her father&#x27;s previous union with a Hawaiian woman.

Through her mother, she descended from Keaweaheulu and Kameʻeiamoku, the royal counselors of Kamehameha I during his conquest of the Hawaiian Islands from 1780 to 1795. Kameʻeiamoku was one of the royal twins along with Kamanawa depicted flanking the Hawaiian coat of arms, and his son Kepoʻokalani was the first cousin of the conqueror on the side of Kamehameha&#x27;s mother Kekuʻiapoiwa II. Their family were collateral relations of the House of Kamehameha and ascended to the throne in 1874 upon the election of her uncle Kalākaua as King of the Hawaiian Islands. Her mother was a younger sister to Kalākaua and Liliʻuokalani. Kaʻiulani&#x27;s father was a Scottish financier from Edinburgh; he served as Collector General of Customs from 1887 to 1893 and as the final Governor of Oahu from 1891 until the office was abolished by the Provisional Government of Hawaii after the 1893 overthrow of the monarchy.

She was christened by Bishop Alfred Willis, at 1:00 p.m. on December 25, 1875, at the Pro-Cathedral of St. Andrew&#x27;s Anglican Cathedral in Honolulu. This was the first christening of a Hawaiian princess since the birth of Victoria Kamāmalu in 1838. The baby Kaʻiulani, clad in a &quot;cashmere robe, embroidered with silk&quot;, was reported to have &quot;behaved with the utmost respect&quot; and did &quot;not utter a sound during the service&quot;. Kalākaua, his wife Queen Kapiʻolani, and Princess Ruth Keʻelikōlani, stood as her godparents. A later reference in a 1916 issue of the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; stated Hawaiian judge Emma Nakuina was also her godmother. Diplomatic representatives from the United States, Britain and France and members of the consular corps in Honolulu were among the spectators. The royal family held a reception and afternoon dinner at ʻIolani Palace for the guests of the ceremony during which Kaʻiulani was present and attended by her nurse. The Royal Hawaiian Band played at the reception. Captain Henri Berger, the leader of the band, composed the &quot;Kaʻiulani March&quot; in her honor.

Princess Ruth gifted Kaʻiulani with land at Waikiki, from Honolulu, which combined with adjacent lands previously purchased in 1872 by Cleghorn to form ʻĀinahau. Her mother Likelike named it ʻĀinahau (cool place) after the cool winds blowing down from the Manoa Valley. Her father relocated the family to the country estate in 1878 when Kaʻiulani was three years old. Cleghorn planted a large botanical garden on the grounds of the estate, including a banyan tree, known as Kaʻiulani&#x27;s banyan. Kaʻiulani&#x27;s mother Princess Likelike died at age 36 on February 2, 1887, officially of unknown causes. Her doctors had believed in vain that she could have been cured with proper nourishment. Upon the death of her mother, when Kaʻiulani was eleven years old, she inherited the estate.

== Education and unrest in Hawaii 1879–1893 ==

From a young age, governesses and private tutors educated Kaʻiulani starting with a British woman, Marion Barnes, from 1879 until her early death of pneumonia in 1884, and then an American woman, Gertrude Gardinier, who became her favorite governess. After Gardinier&#x27;s marriage in 1887, her governesses included a French woman, Catalina de Alcala or D&#x27;Acala, and a German woman, Miss Reiseberg, with whom Kaʻiulani did not develop as strong a bond. Her governesses taught her reading, writing letters (often to relatives), music practices and social training. She also read biographies about her namesake, Queen Victoria. She would become fluent in the Hawaiian, English, French and German languages.

Kalākaua championed future Hawaiian leaders attaining a broader education with his 1880 Hawaiian Youths Abroad program. His niece Kaʻiulani was not the first Hawaiian royal to study abroad. The Hawaiian government sent her cousins David Kawānanakoa (known as Koa), Edward Abnel Keliʻiahonui and Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole to attend Saint Matthew&#x27;s School in the United States in 1885. Keliʻiahonui died young in 1887 while Kawānanakoa and Kūhiō traveled to England in 1890 to finish their education a few months after Kaʻiulani&#x27;s own departure for an education abroad.

Months after the death of Kaʻiulani&#x27;s mother, Likelike, political unrest gripped Hawaii. Local businessmen accused Kalākaua&#x27;s cabinet under Prime Minister Walter Murray Gibson of influence peddling in elections and manipulation of legislative governance. Although the Gibson cabinet was replaced by the Reform Cabinet, the business community remained dissatisfied. The Committee of Thirteen businessmen under the leadership of Lorrin A. Thurston, drafted what became known as the Bayonet Constitution, codifying the legislature as the supreme authority over the monarchy&#x27;s actions. Thurston is believed to have been the principal author of the new constitution. Presented to Kalākaua for his signature on July 6, 1887, it limited the power of the monarchy and increased the influence of Euro-American interests in the government.

=== Abroad in England, 1889–1893 ===
Upon the death of her mother, Likelike, Kaʻiulani became second in line to the throne, following her aunt Liliʻuokalani. She would become the heir apparent after the death of her uncle Kalākaua and the accession of Liliʻuokalani. In 1889, it was deemed appropriate to send Kaʻiulani to England for a proper education and remove her from the intrigues and unrest between Kalākaua and his political opponents. Cleghorn, Kalākaua and allegedly Lorrin A. Thurston, who served as Minister of the Interior, made the plans to send Kaʻiulani abroad. Thurston later denied involvement in the decision.

Leaving Honolulu on May 10, 1889, the travel party included her half-sister Annie, and Mary Matilda Walker, wife of the British vice-consul to Hawaii Thomas R. Walker, as their chaperone. Cleghorn accompanied his daughters to San Francisco before returning to Hawaii. They traveled across the United States by train, stopping briefly at Chicago and New York before sailing to England. They landed in Liverpool on June 17, after a month-long journey. After Mrs. Walker returned to Hawaii, Kaʻiulani and Annie were placed under the guardianship of Theo H. Davies and his wife Mary Ellen. Davies was a British citizen and owner of Theo H. Davies &amp; Co., one of the Big Five leading sugar firms operating in Hawaii. During school holidays, Kaʻiulani stayed at Sundown, the Davies&#x27; residence in Hesketh Park, Southport.

By September, Kaʻiulani and Annie were sent to Northamptonshire and enrolled at Great Harrowden Hall, a boarding school for young girls, under the elderly schoolmistress Caroline Sharp. After the first academic year, Annie returned to Hawaii to marry leaving Kaʻiulani alone at the school. Sharp noted that Kaʻiulani continued &quot;making good progress in her studies&quot; despite the separation. Kaʻiulani proudly wrote home that she was third in her French class. The Bishop of Leicester confirmed her in the Anglican faith in May 1890. In the summer of 1891, her father visited her, and they toured the British Isles and visited the Cleghorns&#x27; ancestral land in Scotland.

Davies persuaded her family to remove Kaʻiulani from Great Harrowden Hall in early 1892 to attend a finishing school to prepare her for society. By February, Kaʻiulani moved to Hove, Brighton, where she was placed in the care of Phebe Rooke who set up private tutors and a curriculum that included German, French, English, literature, history, music and singing. This village by the sea pleased her, and she holidayed in late April and early May at Saint Helier in the Channel Island of Jersey with her host.

The prospect of returning to Hawaii renewed her enthusiasm for her studies. Plans were made for her return to Hawaii by the end of 1893, with the Hawaiian legislature appropriating $4,000 for her travel expenses. This trip would mark her entrance in society as the heir-apparent to the throne. There were arrangements for an audience with Queen Victoria, followed by a tour of Europe and a possible visit to the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. In anticipation, Kaʻiulani wrote to her aunt Liliʻuokalani, &quot;I am looking forward to my return next year. I am beginning to feel very homesick.&quot; However, following the overthrow on January 17, 1893, these plans were cancelled.

== Overthrow 1891–1893 ==

During her absence, much turmoil occurred back in Hawaii. Kalākaua died in San Francisco on January 20, 1891. Kaʻiulani learned of her uncle&#x27;s death by the next day through the Transatlantic telegraph cables while news did not reach Hawaii until January 29, when the &quot;Charleston&quot; returned to Honolulu with the king&#x27;s remains. Liliʻuokalani ascended immediately to the throne. On March 9, with the approval of the House of Nobles, and as required by the Hawaiian constitution, Liliʻuokalani appointed her niece Kaʻiulani as her heir apparent and eventual successor to the throne. The Queen&#x27;s staff then rode through the streets of Honolulu announcing the proclamation, while gun salutes were fired from both the artillery battery and the American vessels &quot;Mohican&quot; and &quot;Iroquois&quot; in Honolulu Harbor.

As heir apparent, Kaʻiulani had influence with the queen on political issues. In the fall of 1891, she wrote to Liliʻuokalani requesting the appointment of her father, instead of Prince David Kawānanakoa, to the recently vacated governorship of Oahu caused by the death of Liliʻuokalani&#x27;s husband John Owen Dominis. The queen acceded to her request, and made the appointment of Cleghorn on November 11. The princess also received approval for her father to retain his post as collector general after she explained, &quot;we cannot do without his salary for that, as the salary of Governor is only half the other.&quot; Kaʻiulani, looking forward to her return, promised, &quot;When I come home I shall try to help you as much as I can, tho [sic] it will not be much as I don&#x27;t understand State Affairs.&quot;
The Committee of Safety, under the leadership of Thurston, met for two days in the final planning of the overthrow, and unanimously selected Sanford B. Dole to lead the coup and organize a provisional government. Dole put forth what he believed was a more reasonable immediate plan of action, a possible outcome that had been discussed by others in the kingdom, &quot;...that the Queen be deposed and Princess Kaʻiulani be installed as queen, and that a regency be established to govern the country during her minority...&quot; In fact, Cleghorn had also directly approached Thurston the morning before the overthrow, with the exact same proposition. Thurston reiterated what he had already told Cleghorn, that the committee had no interest in dealing with a future monarchy in any form, and rejected the plan outright. The monarchy was overthrown and the Provisional Government of Hawaii was proclaimed by President Sanford B. Dole on January 17, 1893.

Liliʻuokalani relinquished her power to the United States temporarily, rather than the Dole-led government, in hopes that the United States would recognize the monarchical government as the lawful power, and thereby restore Hawaii&#x27;s sovereignty. Cleghorn lost his governorship position as of February 28. He blamed Liliʻuokalani&#x27;s political inaction for the overthrow and believed that the monarchy would have been preserved had she abdicated in favor of Kaʻiulani. He met privately with Thurston and requested that he respect Ka&#x27;iulani&#x27;s claim to the throne, which Thurston tersely refused to consider. Cleghorn later took an oath to the Provisional Government under protest in order to retain his position in the custom house, but resigned on April 15.

The Provisional Government&#x27;s ultimate goal was annexation by the United States. Thurston headed a delegation to Washington, D.C., to negotiate with President Benjamin Harrison, while the queen sent her attorney Paul Neumann and Prince Kawānanakoa to represent her case to Harrison and President-elect Grover Cleveland. Cleghorn paid for the travel expenses of Edward C. Macfarlane, another of the queen&#x27;s envoys, to protect the rights of Kaʻiulani. The annexation treaty would have offered Liliʻuokalani a lifetime pension of $20,000 annually, and compensated Kaʻiulani with a one-time settlement of $150,000, if they would subordinate themselves to the United States government, and to local governance of the Islands. The queen never saw that as a viable option.

=== Visit to the United States, 1893 ===

Many factions in Hawaii and abroad preferred restoring Kaʻiulani to the Hawaiian throne in place of Liliʻuokalani under a more restricted form of constitutional monarchy. James Hay Wodehouse, the British commissioner to Hawaii, reported to his superior in London that the natives would support and welcome Kaʻiulani as queen. Charles Reed Bishop, the widower of the High Chiefess Bernice Pauahi Bishop, wrote that, &quot;the better class of the British prefer her, and they would help to control her and make as good a government as possible&quot;. Dole, the leader of the Provisional Government, had stated that it would have been &quot;far more tactful&quot; to &quot;hold the power of the throne&quot; through a &quot;regency in the name of the young Princess Kaʻiulani until she reaches her majority&quot;.

Kaʻiulani learned of the overthrow via a short telegram received by Davies on January 30, Queen Deposed&#x27;, &#x27;Monarchy Abrogated&#x27;, &#x27;Break News to Princess″&quot;. In the weeks after the overthrow, Davies wrote to the Hawaiian Minister to the United States John Mott-Smith in Washington suggesting that the Hawaiian electorate vote on a revised constitution for the abdication of the queen and for the placing Kaʻiulani under a council of regency headed by Dole. Davies reiterated this stance in a later address. Davies advised Kaʻiulani to take her case directly to the American people.

Kaʻiulani, accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. Davies, their daughter Alice Davies, Annie Whartoff, as her lady-in-waiting and a chaperone, and a maid of Mrs. Davies, traveled from Southampton to New York, arriving on March 1. Macfarlane and Mott-Smith met the party on their ship. Upon landing on the pier, Kaʻiulani delivered to the assembled press and curious onlookers a speech written by Davies:

During her first two days, Kaʻiulani and the Davies toured New York and received callers, including her cousin Kawānanakoa, although he was only allowed to speak to her briefly. Dissent developed between Davies and Liliʻuokalani&#x27;s representatives in the United States over his influence over Kaʻiulani. Kawānanakoa along with Neumann, Macfarlane and Mott-Smith voiced criticism at Davies&#x27; action in bringing Kaʻiulani to the United States without the consent of Cleghorn or the queen. They felt Davies&#x27; public statements supporting a regency in place of the queen undermined the cause against annexation and created the impression of a &quot;three-cornered fight&quot;. Macfarlane, himself of British descent, stated to the press, &quot;Her coming will do no good, especially when she is under the wing of an ultra-Britisher.&quot;

From March 3 to March 7, Kaʻiulani visited Boston while Cleveland waited to be sworn in as President. She attended various social events, many in her honor, and toured the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (where the Davies&#x27; son Clive attended) and Wellesley College. Arriving in Washington, D.C., on March 8, Kawānanakoa greeted her at the train station with a floral lei. She stayed at Arlington Hotel where she awaited the chance to meet with the President. In the meantime, Cleveland, who espoused anti-imperialist views, withdrew the treaty of annexation on March 9 and appointed James Henderson Blount on March 11 as special commissioner to investigate the overthrow. On March 13, President and First Lady Frances Cleveland received Kaʻiulani at the White House. Her traveling companion Alice recalled, &quot;We were received by President and Mrs. Cleveland and we had a short interview where all references to our mission were carefully avoided.&quot;

Politics remained uncertain as Hawaii waited for the conclusion of the Blount Report. Macfarlane wanted Kaʻiulani to return to Honolulu while Davies wanted her to accompany him back to England. Macfarlane believed that going back narrowed her perspective in favor of the British, which might affect her policy making should she become queen. On April 8, Cleghorn wrote to Kaʻiulani, &quot;I think for the present you are better not here, much as I would like to have you home. ... [T]hings must be settled soon and then we will know what to do.&quot;

== Establishing life in Europe 1893–1897 ==

Prior to the 1893 overthrow, Kaʻiulani had been allocated an annual pension by the Hawaiian government. As a member of the royal family, she had received $5,000 annually from the civil list between 1882 and 1888, $4,800 between 1888 and 1892 and $10,000 as heir apparent to the throne in 1892. Archibald Cleghorn had also been supported from the Hawaiian civil list through his governmental positions. These sources of income ended after the overthrow.

The unsettled political situation in Hawaii prevented Kaʻiulani from returning home, and her father arranged for her to remain with the Davies family in England. The press releases under her name were in reality created by Davies who, in the beginning, did not ask for her input. It is unclear whether any of the public statements were at her request, but he did eventually give her the opportunity to approve the final product before it went to the news media of the day. The teenage Kaʻiulani spent her summer of 1893 with the Davies family in Killiney, Ireland, where she and her friends played cricket and enjoyed tea.

That winter, Mary Ellen Davies sent her daughter Alice to Wiesbaden, Germany, with Kaʻiulani, and three other women of the same age. Traveling with a chaperone, they were primarily there to learn the German language. Alice later said, &quot; .. I forget just about everything about that journey except that she made many conquests among the susceptible German officers we met.&quot; Family friend Lillian Kennedy remembered a very fun-loving young lady who engaged in pillow fights and played hide-and-seek games. Politics in Hawaii began to seem far away and less important to her. She was beginning to enjoy life abroad, so much so that she resisted returning to the Davies&#x27; home to once again become a political asset.

Accustomed to the life of a Victorian society woman, Kaʻiulani preferred her new life. Writing to her father on June 10, 1894, she expressed her sadness at the change in Hawaii and asked him to consider a life abroad in Europe. After the 1895 royalist counter-revolution, he agreed. While they were abroad, the news of the March 6, 1897, death of her half-sister Annie impacted both Kaʻiulani and Cleghorn.

From August 1895 to October 1897, she and her father assumed the lives of itinerant aristocrats traveling across Europe and the British Isles. They stayed in the French Riviera, Paris, and on the island of Jersey, as well as England, and Scotland. Kaʻiulani was treated as royalty in the French Riviera where they wintered each year and made friends, including Nevinson William (Toby) de Courcy, a British aristocrat who corresponded with her over the next three years and saved her letters until his death.

During these years, Kaʻiulani began to have recurring illnesses, writing her aunt Liliʻuokalani that she&#x27;d had &quot;the grip&quot; (influenza) seven times while living abroad. She also complained of headaches, weight loss, eye problems and fainting spells. A migraine episode in Paris on May 4, 1897, prevented her from attending the Bazar de la Charité, which caught fire and killed a number of French noble women including the Duchess of Alençon. Growing expenses also exacerbated Cleghorn&#x27;s drained financial status, and he wrote to Liliʻuokalani, asking for assistance.

Kaʻiulani knew little about financial management and had no means to repay her benefactors. As her funding ran out, she wondered if the Provisional Government would give her an allowance. Her father had no means to support her, so both were dependent upon the generosity of others. Davies was a hard-nosed businessman who had risen from working-class parents, to make a fortune in Hawaii&#x27;s sugar plantation business. While he agreed to assist with the finances, he took the princess to task for her careless spending in 1894, &quot;I am disappointed in what you say about money matters because I have always been disagreeably plain about them ... You have the chance to be a heroine but unless you exercise resolution and self control ... we shall all fail&quot;. He cautioned that any funding from the Provisional Government obligated her to support their cause. He tried to get Kaʻiulani to re-focus on the goal ahead regarding Hawaii, but she wanted to be in charge of her own destiny. Stress from her financial situation had an adverse effect on her mental and physical health, and she fell into an emotional drift.

== Return to Hawaii, 1897 ==

Kaʻiulani felt duty-bound to her family in Hawaii, especially her ailing aunt, the Dowager Queen Kapiʻolani. However, the princess was wary of her uncertain future as a former royal and was reluctant to accept the prospect of an arranged marriage back home. She was also growing accustomed to life abroad. Despite her misgivings, the changing political situation in Hawaii called her home in 1897. On June 16, Cleveland&#x27;s successor President William McKinley presented the United States Senate with a new version of the annexation treaty to incorporate the Republic of Hawaii into the United States. Liliʻuokalani filed an official protest with Secretary of State John Sherman. Hawaiians against annexation coalesced, including the political entity Hui Kālaiʻāina which ran petition drives to oppose annexation.

Between 1896 and 1897, she divulged her plans to return to Hawaii in two candid letters written to her friend Toby de Courcy. In the first letter, written in the fall of 1896 from Rozel, Jersey, she confided in him that a secret engagement was arranged and she was expected to return in April of the following year. In a subsequent letter dated July 4 from Tunbridge Wells, she explained to Toby that she would visit her aunt Liliʻuokalani in the United States. The decision to return to Hawaii was still undecided at this point. Kaʻiulani added that, &quot;If I went over to see my Aunt I would only stay about Three [&quot;sic&quot;] weeks there and return again here (Europe)&quot;, although Davies &quot;may think it advisable for me to return home the end of this winter&quot;. By August and September, Kaʻiulani and her father were making farewell calls to friends, hiring an Irish maid, Mary O&#x27;Donell, to assist her and preparing for their return to Hawaii.
Kaʻiulani and her father Cleghorn sailed from Southampton to New York on October 9, 1897. After a brief stay at the Albemarle Hotel in New York, the two traveled to Washington, D.C., to pay their respects to Queen Liliʻuokalani, who was staying at Ebbett House in the U.S. capital to lobby against annexation. Afterward, Kaʻiulani and Cleghorn took a train heading west and reached San Francisco on October 29 where they stayed at the Occidental Hotel. During her travels across the United States, many journalists interviewed her, although her father made sure to shield her from topics of politics. Many detractors of the monarchy had painted a negative image of Hawaiians, especially of Kaʻiulani and her aunt Liliʻuokalani. However, interviews with the Hawaiian princess dispelled these rumors. A journalist of San Francisco&#x27;s &quot;The Examiner&quot; wrote, &quot;A barbarian princess? Not a bit of it ..Rather the very flower — an exotic — of civilization. The Princess Kaʻiulani is a charming, fascinating individual.&quot; According to historian Andrea Feeser, the contemporary portrayals of Kaʻiulani were &quot;shaped by race and gender stereotypes, and although they aimed to be favorable, they granted her no authority&quot; with emphasis placed on her Caucasian features, Victorian manners, feminine fragility and exoticism.

Kaʻiulani and her father sailed from San Francisco on November 2 and arrived in Honolulu on the morning of November 9. Thousands of well-wishers, including her cousin Kawānanakoa, greeted her at the harbor in Honolulu and showered her with garlands of lei and flowers. They returned to ʻĀinahau where Kaʻiulani was to assume the life of a private citizen. Her father had built a two-storied new Victorian-style mansion designed by architect Clinton Briggs Ripley next to the bungalow which had been her childhood home in the intervening years when she was abroad. Despite her lack of political status, she continued to receive visitors and made public appearances at events hosted by both monarchists and supporters of the Republic.

The Hawaiian Red Cross Society was formed in June 1898, with Mrs. Harold M. Sewall as its president. Her husband was the United States Minister to the Republic. First Lady of the Republic Anna Prentice Cate Dole was selected as first vice-president, and Kaʻiulani was second vice-president. It is unclear if the princess had given her consent to be named as part of the committee, but she did not attend the subsequent meeting of the officers.

In the United States Senate, McKinley&#x27;s annexation treaty failed to pass after months without a vote. However, following the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, Hawaii was annexed in any event via the Newlands Resolution, a joint resolution of Congress, on July 4, 1898. With the impending annexation of Hawaii only weeks away and Liliʻuokalani still in Washington, D.C., Hawaii wanted to show its support of U.S. troops heading to the Pacific theater of the war. If nothing else, the harbor traffic meant income for the local businesses. Cleghorn and Kaʻiulani issued an open invitation for visiting American troops to stay at ʻĀinahau, although it was more likely solely her father&#x27;s idea. She wrote to Liliʻuokalani, &quot;I am sure you would be disgusted if you could see the way the town is decorated for the American troops. Honolulu is making a fool of itself and I only hope we won&#x27;t be ridiculed.&quot;
The annexation ceremony was held on August 12, 1898, at the former ʻIolani Palace, now being used as the executive building of the government. President Dole handed over &quot;the sovereignty and public property of the Hawaiian Islands&quot; to United States minister Harold M. Sewall. The flag of the Republic of Hawaii was lowered, and the flag of the United States was raised in its place. &quot;When the news of Annexation came it was bitterer than death to me,&quot; Kaʻiulani told the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. &quot;It was bad enough to lose the throne, but infinitely worse to have the flag go down ...&quot;. Liliʻuokalani with Kaʻiulani, their family members and retainers boycotted the event and shuttered themselves away at Washington Place in mourning. Many Native Hawaiians and royalists followed suit and refused to attend the ceremony. The Republican government attempted to invite her to the Annexation Ball, and she responded by saying, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you ask me if I am going to pull down Hawaii&#x27;s flag for them?&quot;

On September 7, 1898, Kaʻiulani hosted the United States Congressional commission party and more than 120 guests with a grand luau at ʻĀinahau. The commissioners: the new Territorial Governor Dole, Senators Shelby M. Cullom of Illinois and John T. Morgan of Alabama, Representative Robert R. Hitt of Illinois, and Hawaii associate justice and the later Territorial Governor Walter F. Frear were tasked with forming a new territorial government. Kaʻiulani arranged the event to highlight the importance of Hawaiian culture and started the luau by dipping her finger in the poi. The luau at ʻĀinahau for the congressional party was portrayed in the 2009 film as a fight for Hawaiian suffrage, which was ensured in the 1900 Hawaiian Organic Act.

== Personal life ==
=== Surfing ===
Kaʻiulani had always been an athletic young woman, who enjoyed equestrianism, surfing, swimming, croquet, and canoeing. In an 1897 interview for &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper in New York, she stated, &quot;I love riding, driving, swimming, dancing and cycling. Really, I&#x27;m sure I was a seal in another world because I am so fond of the water… My mother taught me to swim almost before I knew how to walk.&quot; An avid surfer on the shores of Waikiki, her 7 feet, 4 inch &quot;alaia&quot; surfboard made of koa (acacia koa) is preserved at the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum. Acquired by the museum in 1922 from her deceased father’s estate, it is one of the few surviving examples of 19th-century Hawaiian surfboards.

According to popular belief, she may have been the first female surfer in the British Isles. However, the Museum of British Surfing states &quot;the only tangible evidence – so far – is a letter in which she wrote that she enjoyed ‘being on the water again’ at Brighton.&quot; Her three cousins Kawananakoa, Kuhio and Keliʻiahonui pioneered surfing in California in 1885. Kawananakoa and Kūhiō became the first male surfers in the British Isles in 1890 when they went surf riding with their tutor John Wrightson at Bridlington in northern England. The swimming attire for Victorian-minded Hawaiian royals would have been full-body swimwear made of wool or cotton.

=== Robert Louis Stevenson ===
Kaʻiulani was a painter who enjoyed the company of other artists. While under Davies&#x27; guardianship, she sent some of her paintings of England home to Hawaii. When Kalakaua was ill in his final year, she sent a painting to cheer him up. Her few surviving paintings are found in Hawaii. She was acquainted with Joseph Dwight Strong, a landscape painter in the court of Kalākaua, and Isobel Osbourne Strong, a lady-in-waiting to Likelike. Isobel&#x27;s stepfather was Scottish writer Robert Louis Stevenson. In June 1888, Stevenson chartered the yacht &quot;Casco&quot; and set sail with his family from San Francisco. The poet spent nearly three years in the eastern and central Pacific, stopping for extended stays at the Hawaiian Islands, where he became a good friend of King Kalākaua and Ka&#x27;iulani. Stevenson and the princess often strolled at ʻĀinahau and sat beneath its banyan tree. Prior to her departure, Stevenson composed a poem for her. He later wrote to his friend Will Hicok Low, &quot;If you want to cease to be Republican, see my little Kaiulani, as she goes through [the United States].&quot; Historian A. Grove Day noted, &quot;Of all his island friendships, the platonic affair with the half-Scottish princess has most persisted in the imagination of lovers of Hawaiiana.&quot;

=== Matchmaking and engagement rumors ===

During his 1881 world tour, Kalākaua held a secret meeting with Emperor Meiji and proposed to unite the two nations in an alliance with an arranged marriage between his 5-year-old niece Kaʻiulani and the 13-year-old Prince Yamashina Sadamaro. From extant letters to the king, both by Prince Sadamaro, upon the advice of his adoptive father, and by Japanese foreign minister Inoue Kaoru declined the proposal on behalf of the government of Japan. In February 1893, the Japanese Imperial Navy gunboat &quot;Naniwa&quot; was docked at Pearl Harbor with the Japanese prince on board. Rumors circulated in the American press that the Japanese considered intervening militarily.
From 1893 until her death, rumors of whom Kaʻiulani would wed circulated in the American and Hawaiian press, and on one occasion she was pressured by Queen Liliʻuokalani to marry. When Clive Davies, son of Kaʻiulani&#x27;s guardian Theo H. Davies, was a student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1893, he was rumored to be Kaʻiulani&#x27;s fiancé. Although the princess had stayed with the family occasionally while she was in England, her father said there was no engagement between the two young people and the rumors were &quot;absurd and preposterous&quot;. In spite of the denial, the rumors persisted for a time. However, Clive was engaged to Edith Fox, daughter of civil engineer Francis Fox, between 1896 and 1898 while he resided in Honolulu and handled his father&#x27;s business. Another rumor, which circulated after Kaʻiulani&#x27;s return to Hawaii, said she was to marry Clive&#x27;s brother George Davies. Members of Kaʻiulani&#x27;s household denied this.

On January 29, 1894, when Kaʻiulani was nineteen, Liliʻuokalani wrote asking her to consider marrying either Prince David Kawānanakoa, Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, or an unnamed Japanese prince (then studying in London). She reminded her, &quot;To you then depends the hope of the Nation and unfortunately we cannot always do as we like.&quot; It took five months for Kaʻiulani to respond to Liliʻuokalani&#x27;s suggestion. In a June 22, 1894, letter Kaʻiulani asserted that she would prefer to marry for love unless it was necessary stating, &quot;I feel it would be wrong if I married a man I did not love.&quot; Based on personal letters and letters by her friends, many suitors courted Kaʻiulani while she resided in England and Europe. Prior to her return to Hawaii in November 1897, Kaʻiulani confided in her friend Toby de Courcy that she would have to end her courtship with one of her &quot;young men&quot; because there was an arranged marriage waiting for her in Hawaii. She further hinted that the union, approved by her father and Theo H. Davies, was being kept secret for political reasons. She lamented, &quot;I must have been born under an unlucky star as I seem to have my life planned out for me in such a way that I cannot alter it.&quot; Historian Marilyn Stassen-McLaughlin and biographer Sharon Linnea could not identify the gentleman behind the secret union from the primary sources, but conjectured it was Kawānanakoa because he was the only likely candidate for a political union after Kūhiō had married in 1896.
Records indicate that there may have been a written agreement of betrothal with Kawānanakoa, that was quickly aborted. An unsubstantiated announcement dated February 3, 1898, was printed in &quot;The San Francisco Call&quot; and later reprinted in newspapers across the United States. According to the report, the betrothal was dependent upon the finalization of deeds to a sizeable real estate holding, transferred from Queen Kapiʻolani to both Kawānanakoa and Kalanianaʻole. On February 19, a denial of betrothal from Kawānanakoa was printed in the newspapers. Kapiʻolani did deed all her property, real and personal, to the brothers on February 10, with the express stipulation that the documentation not be executed until she was ready. Kapiʻolani wanted to hold off the transfer until she was too old to manage the property herself, and/or otherwise would believe she was close to death. She last saw the document with her notary Carlos A. Long, with her instructions to have changes made in the wording. Instead, the brothers had the deed executed immediately, without her knowledge.

Family lore also conflicts over the exact nature of her relationship with Kawānanakoa. Kaʻiulani&#x27;s niece Mabel Robertson Lucas (daughter of her sister Rose) said that the two cousins were close but only like siblings. Nancy and Jean Francis Webb&#x27;s 1962 biography of Kaʻiulani says that Kawānanakoa&#x27;s eventual wife, Abigail Campbell Kawānanakoa, told an unnamed biographer or close friend that &quot;of course I never could have married David if Kaʻiulani had lived&quot;. The Bishop Museum collection has a number of jewels owned by Kaʻiulani, including a diamond and aquamarine necklace given to her by Queen Kapiʻolani in 1897, in honor of her engagement to an unnamed suitor. Kaʻiulani replaced the chain attaching the gems with strands of small pearls.

According to a letter written to Liliʻuokalani dated to June 22, 1894, in which she declined the idea of an arranged marriage, she mentioned that she had rejected a proposal by an &quot;enormously rich German Count&quot;. She was connected in the press to two other suitors in 1898: Captain Putnam Bradlee Strong, an American officer en route to fight in the Spanish–American War in Manilla and son of New York City Mayor William Lafayette Strong, and Andrew Adams, a New England-born journalist for &quot;The Pacific Commercial Advertiser&quot; whom her father favored. In 1895, &quot;The Evening Republican&quot; reported a rumor that Kaʻiulani was to marry Rudolph Spreckels, the son of sugar magnate Claus Spreckels. A posthumous report in &quot;The Butte Daily Post&quot;, after Kaʻiulani&#x27;s death, connected her to James G. Blaine, Jr, son of former United States Secretary of State James G. Blaine.

== Death and burial, 1898–1899 ==
Kaʻiulani traveled to the Parker Ranch at Waimea, on the island of Hawaii on December 6, 1898. The ranch owner, Samuel Parker, had served on Kalākaua&#x27;s privy council, and was Liliʻuokalani&#x27;s minister of foreign affairs when the monarchy was overthrown. Kaʻiulani attended the December 14 wedding of Parker&#x27;s daughter, who was her childhood friend Eva, to Frank Woods, and stayed for Christmas festivities. The celebrations and activities went on for weeks. In mid-January 1899, Kaʻiulani and a number of other guests mounted horses and rode out for a picnic. What started out as pleasant weather soon turned into a windy rainstorm. While others on the ride donned raincoats, Kaʻiulani was gleefully galloping through the rain without a coat. It was not until later, when they were back on the ranch, that she began feeling ill. Upon learning of her situation on January 24, her father sailed immediately to the island on the steamship &quot;Kinau&quot;. Their family physician, &quot;Doctor Walters&quot; (Saint David G. Walters), accompanied him. After medical treatment, the public was told two weeks later that she was on the mend.

However, Kaʻiulani was still frail, and her illness lingered. A petition to President William McKinley and Congress, urging the United States to grant the princess a pension, was being circulated for signatures. In reality, she was still gravely ill, and Cleghorn brought her back to ʻĀinahau on February 9, on the steamship &quot;Mauna Loa&quot;. She was so ill she had to be carried on a stretcher. Walters said it was &quot;inflammatory rheumatism&quot;. He later added that she also had an exophthalmic goitre.

Kaʻiulani died of inflammatory rheumatism, at her home at ʻĀinahau, on Monday, March 6, 1899, at the age of 23. Later, George W. Macfarlane, a family friend and King Kalākaua&#x27;s chamberlain, told a reporter from the &quot;San Francisco Call&quot; that the princess possibly died of a broken heart. Kaʻiulani had loved peacocks, growing up around a flock originally belonging to her mother at ʻĀinahau. She would sometimes be called the &quot;Peacock Princess&quot;. Her beloved peacocks could be heard screaming in the night when she died. It was later determined that the late-night activities and lights likely agitated the birds, but others still believed that the peacocks were mourning her death. Native Hawaiian protocol dictated that the body of an &quot;aliʻi&quot; (royal) could only be moved after midnight following death and had to be interred on the sabbath. She lay in her own home until Saturday, March 11, when her body was moved just after midnight. The route from ʻĀinahau to the lying in state at Kawaiahaʻo Church became a growing funeral procession as native Hawaiians fell in line with lit torches and wailed mournfully.

The Republic of Hawaii government put all its resources at the family&#x27;s disposal and gave her a state funeral on March 12. She lay in state at Kawaiahaʻo Church until her final service. Hundreds of individuals and organizations made up the procession. &quot;The Pacific Commercial Advertiser&quot; estimated that 20,000 spectators lined the streets. The most-recent (1896) census had shown only 29,000 residents in all of Honolulu. Her remains were brought to the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii at ʻMauna Ala in the Nuʻuanu Valley for burial. She was interred in the main chapel of the mausoleum, joining her mother Likelike and the other deceased members of the royal houses of Kalākaua and Kamehameha.

In a ceremony officiated by Liliʻuokalani on June 24, 1910, the family&#x27;s remains were transferred for a final time to the underground Kalākaua Crypt after the main mausoleum building had been converted into a chapel. Her father was also interred in the crypt after his death on November 1, 1910.

== Cultural impact and legacy ==

When Kaʻiulani was born, kerosene lamps provided Honolulu&#x27;s street lighting. During Kalākaua&#x27;s 1881 world tour, he visited Thomas Edison who gave him a demonstration of electric light bulbs. ʻIolani Palace led the way in and installed the first electric lighting in Hawaii in 1886. The public was invited to attend the first-night lighting ceremonies. The Royal Hawaiian Band entertained, refreshments were served, and the king, on horseback, paraded his troops around the grounds. When Honolulu finally electrified all its street lighting, the honor of throwing the switch at the Nuʻuanu generators to light up the city fell to 12-year-old Kaʻiulani on Friday, March 23, 1888.
In the fall of 2007, British filmmaker Marc Forby began production on a $9 million film titled &quot;Barbarian Princess&quot; based on the princess&#x27; attempts to restore her nation&#x27;s independence. Princess Kaʻiulani was played by 12-year-old Kaimana Paʻaluhi of Oahu and by Q&#x27;Orianka Kilcher. Barry Pepper, Will Patton, and Shaun Evans co-star. In March 2008, scenes were filmed on location at the ʻIolani Palace. The film&#x27;s world premiere was held at the Hawaii Theatre in Honolulu, Hawaii, on Friday, October 16, 2009, as part of the Hawaii International Film Festival. The film&#x27;s title provoked controversy, and the film opened with mixed reviews. However, demand to see the film was high and the film festival scheduled several additional screenings. The movie&#x27;s title has since been changed to &quot;Princess Kaʻiulani&quot;. Roadside Attractions acquired the movie&#x27;s United States rights and scheduled it for theatrical release on May 14, 2010.

Forby&#x27;s film is not the first project to bring the Princess to the screen: Kaʻiulani biographer Kristin Zambucka produced a docudrama called &quot;A Cry of Peacocks&quot; for Hawaiian television, broadcast in 1994 by Green Glass Productions and KITV. Princess Kaʻiulani was played by Heather Kuʻupuaohelomakamae Marsh.

In 1999, the Outrigger Hotels commissioned a statue of Kaʻiulani at Waikiki. An annual &quot;keiki&quot; (children) hula festival is held in her honor in October at the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani Hotel (built on the former grounds of ʻĀinahau). In March 2017, &quot;Hawaiʻi Magazine&quot; ranked her on a list of the most influential women in Hawaiian history.

=== The Kaʻiulani Project ===
The Kaʻiulani Project began in 2007 after completion of five years of research on the life of the princess. Members of the project, which was founded by Jennifer Fahrni, include descendants of the princess&#x27;s family, Hawaiian cultural leaders, kumu hula and Hawaiian educators. The goal of the project was to make Kaʻiulani&#x27;s dual culture and her legacy for the Hawaiian people more widely known and ultimately taught in Hawaiian schools. In 2007 the project began work with Hawaiian educators as well as cultural and performing arts organizations, producing presentations and play readings throughout the state.

On October 16, 2010, The Kaʻiulani Project, in co-ordination with the Royal Guards of Hawaii produced the Lahaina Royal Hoʻike where official Hawaiian protocols were performed for the first time in honor of Kaʻiulani in over 100 years. Delegations from all islands took part in the event on the sacred grounds of Mokuʻula and Waiola Church. This was first time since Kaʻiulani’s passing that her family participated in official Hawaiian celebrations of her life. Hoʻokupu offerings were presented to and received by Kaʻiulani’s grand-niece in honor of the princess’s 135th birthday. 
Numerous civic and cultural organizations in Hawaii including the Royal Order of Kamehameha I participate in the event. Entertainment was provided by the Royal Hawaiian Band and other performers. The story of the princess&#x27;s life was also presented with selected scenes from the original script “Ka’iulani, The Island Rose”.

The Kaʻiulani Project includes &quot;Kaʻiulani: The Island Rose&quot;, a fact-based screenplay and stage play researched and written since 2003 by Fahrni and Carol Harvie-Yamaguchi, and a biography &quot;Princess Kaʻiulani – Her Life and Times&quot;. The script was first performed as a public reading on April 12, 2008, in Kahului, Hawaii, on Maui.

=== ʻĀinahau and her banyan tree ===
Archibald Cleghorn willed the estate of ʻĀinahau to the Territory of Hawaii for a park to honor Ka&#x27;iulani after his death in 1910. However, the territorial legislature refused the gift. The property was subdivided and sold with the Victorian mansion at ʻĀinahau becoming a hotel and then a rental property before it burned down on August 2, 1921. The Daughters of Hawaii, an organization founded in 1903 to preserve the islands&#x27; historic legacy, was given responsibility for the care of Ka&#x27;iulani&#x27;s banyan tree. On October 16, 1930, the Daughters of Hawaii installed a bronze plaque near the tree to honor the memory of Ka&#x27;iulani and her friendship with Robert Louis Stevenson. However, the mounting cost of annual pruning, and concerns about the health of the tree, led to it being cut down in 1949.

=== Kaʻiulani Elementary School ===
Kaʻiulani Elementary School was founded in the Kapālama neighborhood of Honolulu on April 25, 1899. During Arbor Day of 1900, the school principal planted a cutting from her banyan tree at ʻĀinahau, given to the school by Archibald Cleghorn. Local efforts prevented the tree from being cut down in the 1950s and the tree survives to the present. The bronze plaque from the original banyan tree was later moved to this site. Other cuttings from the original banyan were planted in other parts of Hawaii.

<text>Glenmont station is a Washington Metro station in Montgomery County, Maryland on the Red Line. It is the eastern terminus of the Red Line.

The station, located at Georgia Avenue and Layhill Road, serves the suburbs of Glenmont and Aspen Hill. Service began on July 25, 1998.

==History==

===Early planning===
Glenmont was planned to be the location of the end of a line in the original layout of the Metrorail system that was approved in 1968. Two months later, the Glenmont Vicinity Citizens Association and several other citizens&#x27; groups attempted to have the line end at Silver Spring instead because they did not want the added development, and they thought the extended lines would be too expensive. There were also concerns that the line would eventually be extended to Olney, which would change its rural character. The House Interior Appropriates Subcommittee was not convinced, and the plan went along unchanged. At the time, the station was planned to open in 1979.

As of 1970, the site for building the station was vacant land zoned for residential use and owned by Georgia Avenue Baptist Church. Safeway wanted to build a supermarket on the site, and it petitioned the county to change the site from residential to commercial zoning in 1970. Metro had not planned to purchase the land until 1975. WMATA protested, saying that rezoning would add $750,000 to the value of the land, which would increase its costs when it later needed to purchase the land. WMATA could not purchase the land at the time because engineering studies determining the exact placement of the station had not yet been completed and, regardless, it had not appropriated the funds to purchase the land yet. Metro asked Montgomery County to purchase the land to hold for its eventual use, but the county declined when WMATA could not guarantee that engineering studies would later find the site suitable for the station. Because the surrounding land was already classified as commercial and because WMATA would not need the land for the station for at least eight more years, the Montgomery County Council said it had no authority to decline the rezoning request. Days later, a deal was struck, whereas WMATA pledged to purchase the land within three years, Montgomery County would reserve the land for WMATA, and Georgia Avenue Baptist Church would not be required to pay property tax on the land.

===1977 plans===
In May 1977, Secretary of Transportation Brock Adams questioned extending the Red Line to Glenmont, citing the increased costs projected after engineers determined that the bedrock required building the tracks much deeper than had been anticipated. Under pressure from the Office of Management and Budget and President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s administration, Adams requested that the line be studied again to determine whether a bus, trolley, or highway would be a good alternative to extending the red line to Glenmont. Montgomery County Executive James P. Gleason responded, saying that the line had been studied extensively already, and he considered pulling all county funding from building the Metrorail system if the Glenmont extension did not go forward.

By June, a compromise had been reached; cost-cutting measures would be studied, but the Red Line would indeed be extended to Glenmont. The following month, Gleason decided to withhold all funding to WMATA until the Department of Transportation guaranteed in writing that the Metrorail extension to Glenmont would be built. The Montgomery County Council voted in disagreement with Gleason&#x27;s decision, thinking that the action might also jeopardize the Metrorail extension to Shady Grove, but the Council did not actually have the power to force him to send the money to WMATA. Maryland Secretary of Transportation Hermann Intemann also decided to withhold state funding to WMATA until Adams guaranteed the line would be built.

In October, consultants suggested building Forest Glen and Wheaton stations as two small separated tubes rather than using one large cavernous design that had been used for nearly every other underground station. The consultants said that changing the design of those two stations would save $352.6 million. Glenmont station would still be built with the cavernous underground design. Gleason praised the study because it saved significant money without sacrificing the stations, and he decided to release Montgomery County&#x27;s construction funding after plans surfaced for a study by region-wide task force. In February 1978, the Department of Transportation approved engineering studies of the Glenmont line extension, which suggesting it was warming to building the line after all. The study by a regionwide task force ended up approving the routing of stations on other Metrorail lines but it did not review the routing of the red line at all. In August, WMATA board members approved a Metrorail plan that included building the Glenmont extension as the latter phase of a two-phase construction schedule. WMATA released the plan to the Department of Transportation.

===Delays===
In July 1979, Adams released all held-up federal funding for all of Metrorail&#x27;s lines. With all federal construction delays resolved, Glenmont metro station was scheduled to open in 1986. By 1982, the station&#x27;s opening was rescheduled to 1991.

In 1984, President Reagan&#x27;s administration limited the number of miles of track that could be built, effectively preventing the extending the red line from Wheaton to Glenmont. Later that year, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted to lift the construction limitation. The Reagan administration continued to block federal funding, and opening of the Glenmont station was pushed back to 1994. In 1985, the Office of Management and Budget recommended halting all federal funding of construction, further jeopardizing the Glenmont extension. In 1991, Congress approved construction funding, and WMATA said the Glenmont station was scheduled to open in 1998.

President Bill Clinton&#x27;s administration approved funding of the Glenmont extension in 1993. WMATA broke ground on construction of the station in 1993, and workers began laying rail lines in 1996. The station opened on July 25, 1998.

===2024 closing===
On June 1, 2024, all Red Line stations north of Fort Totten, including this one were closed to allow the Maryland Transit Authority to work on the upcoming Purple Line. Takoma reopened on June 29 while the rest of the stations reopened September 1st.

==Station layout==
Glenmont is the only station on the Red Line to feature the six-coffer arch design, which is also seen on the Green Line. Until 2023, it was the only underground terminus in the Washington Metro (the other being ), and until 2006, it was also the only station in the system lit with sodium-vapor lamps. These lamps gave the station a warm orange glow and were later replaced with the mercury vapor lamps found in other underground stations. The Glenmont rail yard is located just beyond this station and has the ability to store 132 rail cars.

There are two street-level access points for the station, located on either side of Georgia Avenue (Route 97). Unlike older Metro stations, there are two street elevators serving the mezzanine, though there is only one elevator between the mezzanine and platform levels. The station is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. However, the station lacks backup elevators leading to the platform. In the event that the elevator is not operational, shuttle service is provided to the next station. Many Metrobus routes serve the station.

There is a parking lot north of the station that was originally purchased by the county for the proposed Foxhall Elementary School and Layhill Junior High School, neither of which were built.

It also features the &quot;Arch II&quot; design found at Columbia Heights, Congress Heights, Georgia Avenue-Petworth, and Mount Vernon Square.

<doc id="560936" wikidata="Q781203" url="?curid=560936" title="Duke of Berwick">
<text>Duke of Berwick () &quot;()&quot; is a title that was created in the Peerage of England on 19 March 1687 for James FitzJames, the illegitimate son of James II and VII, King of England, Scotland, and Ireland and Arabella Churchill. The title&#x27;s name refers to the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed in England, near the border with Scotland.

Its creation is not considered part of the illegitimate Jacobite peerage, and no Writ of attainder was issued by Parliament for the Dukedom (although it was for the Duke himself), the title is still considered by some as theoretically extant, albeit dormant, in the Peerage of England and could be petitioned for reinstatement by the legitimate heirs male of the body (as detailed below in the list of Jacobite succession).

Since 13 December 1707, when Philip V, King of Spain confirmed the title in his country, and conferred the dignity of Grandee to the 1st Duke of Berwick, the dukedom is also a title of Spanish nobility. However, unlike the English peerage, the Spanish title follows the rule of absolute [[primogeniture]], which allows a female to succeed if she is the first-born child. Thus following the death of the 10th Duke of Berwick in September 1953, who had only a daughter, the succession has divided into two separate lines.

At this point, the English title was inherited by the nephew of the 10th Duke, Don Fernando Fitz-James Stuart y Saavedra, 19th Duke of Peñaranda (1922–1971), and subsequently Fernando&#x27;s son Don Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart y Gómez, 20th Duke of Peñaranda (born 1947), who became the 12th Duke of Berwick in 1971. The heir presumptive to the Dukedom is the 12th Duke’s younger brother Don Luis Fitz-James Stuart y Gómez, 14th Marquess of Valderrábano (born 1950). Under the English rule of [[Heirs of the body|male]] [[primogeniture]], since Jacobo and his brother Luis do not have male issue, it is expected that the English peerage title will become extinct.

In contrast, in 1953, the Spanish title was inherited by the 10th Duke’s only daughter, Doña Cayetana Fitz-James Stuart, 18th Duchess of Alba (1926-2014), who was, in her own right, the 11th Duchess of Berwick. When she died in 2014, her son Don Carlos Fitz-James Stuart, 19th Duke of Alba (born 1948) succeeded to the title. The heir apparent to the dukedom is his eldest son Don Fernando Fitz-James Stuart, 17th Duke of Huéscar (born 1990).

==History==
The peerage and its subsidiary titles were generally considered to have been forfeit by the English parliament in 1695, when James FitzJames was attainted following the enforced exile of his father. The College of Arms in its Roll of the Peerage does not list any such title, which means that it is non-existent today in England.

Nevertheless, the titles were recognized in France as &quot;de facto&quot; Jacobite peerages by Louis XIV, King of France to please the exiled James II &amp; VII, along with other Jacobite peerages recognized in France, like Duke of Perth, Duke of Melfort, etc. On 13 December 1707, Philip V confirmed or issued the title in Spain, and he conferred the dignity of Grandee of Spain on James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick. The grandeeship is attached to the Spanish title of Duke of Berwick.

If the English peerage title was still extant, that title is only inheritable in the male line. At the death of Don Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart, 17th Duke of Alba and 10th Duke of Berwick, the English title would have been inherited by his nephew Don Fernando FitzJames Stuart, 15th Duke of Peñaranda de Duero (1922–1971), and subsequently by Fernando&#x27;s son Don Jacobo FitzJames Stuart, 16th Duke of Peñaranda de Duero and current head of the House of FitzJames (born in 1947 and without children).

The Spanish title, with the accompanying dignity of Grandee of Spain, follows the inheritance rules of that country. Spanish noble titles historically have followed the rule of male-preference primogeniture, which allows a female to succeed if she has no living brothers and no deceased brothers who left surviving legitimate descendants. With the death of the 10th Duke of Berwick in September 1953, his only child, Doña Cayetana Fitz-James Stuart, 18th Duchess of Alba, succeeded him in his Spanish titles, including the Spanish dukedom of Berwick. With her death in November 2014, the dukedom passed to her eldest son, Don Carlos Fitz-James Stuart y Martínez de Irujo.

==Dukes of Berwick (1687–1695)==
==Jacobite Dukes of Berwick (1695–present)==

==Spanish Dukes of Berwick (1707–present)==
&quot;Before 1953, the Spanish Dukes were also the Jacobite Dukes of Berwick. The line split due to the differences between the Spanish and Jacobite succession laws (male-preference primogeniture and agnatic primogeniture respectively). &quot;

<text>FASat-Alfa was to become the first Chilean satellite, and was constructed under a Technology Transfer Program between the Chilean Air Force (FACH) and Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL) of the United Kingdom. The primary goal of the Program was to obtain for Chile the basic scientific and technological experience required to continue with more advanced steps. The purposes of the FASat-Alfa mission are to create a group of engineers with aerospace experience, to have the first Chilean satellite in orbit, and to install and operate the Mission Control Station (ECM-Santiago) in Chile.

There were two satellites: FASat-Alfa and FASat-Bravo. The Alfa satellite was launched on 31 August 1995 on TSYCLON from Plesetsk. Its orbit was intended to be 682 x 651 km, inclined at 82.53 degrees; however, the spacecraft failed to separate from the failed Ukrainian satellite it was attached to.

The Bravo satellite was launched on 10 July 1998, on TSYCLON from Baikonur. Its intended orbit was 682 x 651 km, inclined at 82.53 degrees. It was to operate 13,000 orbits until 2002.

<text>Prenzlauer Berg () is a locality of Berlin, forming the southerly and most urban district of the borough of Pankow. From its founding in 1920 until 2001, Prenzlauer Berg was a district of Berlin in its own right. However, that year it was incorporated (along with the borough of Weißensee) into the greater district of Pankow.

From the 1960s onward, Prenzlauer Berg was associated with proponents of East Germany&#x27;s diverse counterculture including Christian activists, bohemians, state-independent artists, and the gay community. It was an important site for the peaceful revolution that brought down the Berlin Wall in 1989. In the 1990s the borough was also home to a vibrant squatting scene. It has since experienced rapid gentrification.

== Geography ==
Prenzlauer Berg is a portion of the Pankow district in northeast Berlin. To the west and southwest it borders Mitte, to the South Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, to the east Lichtenberg, and to the north Weißensee and Pankow.

Geologically, the borough straddles the southernmost edge of the Barnim glacial deposit formed during the last Ice Age. Prenzlauer Berg (literally Prenzlau Hill) was always seen as a hill by the inhabitants of historic Berlin situated to the south in the glacial valley along the river Spree. Until the 20th century the area was mostly referred to as &quot;Windmill Hill&quot;.

The highest point of the district is 91 meters above sea level in the northwest of Volkspark Prenzlauer Berg. This hill consists of the rubble from buildings that were destroyed in World War II during allied air raids and by Soviet artillery in the Battle of Berlin.

== Cityscape ==
Prenzlauer Berg is characterized by Wilhelmine buildings, that were erected at the turn of the 20th century (1889 to 1905). Over 80% of all housing in this area was constructed before 1948, with the oldest building still standing being from 1848 at Kastanienallee 77. Though substantial, there was less war-related destruction here than in other parts of the city, which were almost entirely wiped out by the allied bombing campaign.
Apart from the apartment buildings in the area around Ostseestraße built in the 1950s characterized by the architectural style of Socialist Classicism, the borough was mostly left alone by Socialist city planners until the 1980s when prestigious high rise buildings were built in Ernst-Thälmann-Park.

During German Reunification, the borough&#x27;s residential areas were characterized by dilapidated grey facades that had not seen a coat of paint since the 1930s. In the 1990s the buildings that belonged to state-owned housing associations were sold to private investors, who had them renovated and raised the rents. Most of the borough&#x27;s original inhabitants could not afford the increased costs and have since moved away. In the 21st century the many empty lots that were sites for the street culture integral to the bohemian character of the borough were filled by high-class condominiums.

Prenzlauer Berg is an almost homogeneous historic building area in which much of the pre-war architecture has been preserved and where there are still many cobbled streets and ornate buildings from the beginning of the 20th century. 

Over 300 buildings remain protected as historic monuments, like the municipal swimming pool at Oderberger Straße and the breweries on Milastraße and Knaackstraße. The borough is famous for its restaurants and bars. Although places that provide a truly traditional Berlin staple are few and far between, there is a vast array of restaurants offering Arab, Turkish, Vietnamese, Tex-Mex, and Italian cuisine, especially around Kastanienallee, Kollwitzplatz, and Helmholtzplatz. The area around the intersections of Schönhauser Allee, Danziger Straße, Eberswalder Straße, Kastanienallee and Pappelallee has been associated with youth culture since the 1950s, and was immortalised in the DEFA film &quot;Ecke Schönhauser&quot;.

With regard to urban planning, the district affords a relatively uniform picture. It is predominantly characterized by five-story, multiple dwelling units in closed blocks. Thanks to the long property lots, the blocks, more often than not, are large and have abundant backyards, some having a perimeter of more than a kilometer.

Notable buildings include the large churches of the district, of which Gethsemane Church (designed by August Orth and built in 1891–1893) at Stargarder Straße is best known for its role in the peaceful revolution that brought down the Wall in 1989. Its steeple is surpassed locally only by that of Segenskirche on Schönhauser Allee () and of Immanuelkirche on Prenzlauer Allee (). School buildings planned by Ludwig Ernst Emil Hoffmann (1852–1932) also stand out in the area.

The Rykestrasse synagogue in the area remains the largest in Germany. Construction began at the end of 1903 and it was dedicated on 4 September 1904. During the Third Reich, the building escaped the antisemitic November pogrom in 1938, as it was closely surrounded by residential buildings. However, the synagogue was later desecrated and confiscated in April 1940. In July 1945, it reopened for services, underwent several renovations (1952/1953, 1976, 1987/1988), and on the occasion of its 100th anniversary was restored to its original splendor. In the Jewish Cemetery on Schönhauser Allee, opened in 1827, there are more than 22,500 graves and 750 family tombs, including the graves of David Friedländer, Max Liebermann, Leopold Ullstein, Ludwig Bamberger, Eduard Lasker, and Giacomo Meyerbeer.
A landmark in Prenzlauer Berg is the former water tower &quot;Fat Hermann&quot; at the corner of Rykestraße and Knaackstraße near Kollwitzplatz. Built in 1877, it is the first water tower in Berlin. Historic buildings like the water tower, or the &quot;Prater Beer Garden&quot; in Kastanienallee, as well as the former brewery at Schönhauser Allee and Sredzkystraße still give an impression of the days when Prenzlauer Berg was part of the so-called &quot;Steinernes Berlin (Berlin of stone)&quot; as described by author Werner Hegemann in 1930. Another notable building is the Zeiss Major Planetarium on Prenzlauer Allee, opened in 1987.

In the west, bordering the borough of Wedding and adjacent to Friedrich Ludwig Jahn Sportpark, is a stretch of public green area called Mauerpark (Wall park). It consists of the former border zone, or &quot;death strip&quot; between both walls that separated East and West Berlin. Before the war, the terrain was a site of a freight station. After reunification, the area was turned into a public park which hosts a weekly flea market and open air concerts. It attracts thousands of visitors on summer weekends.

== History ==

Prenzlauer Berg was developed during the second half of the 19th century based on 1862 urban planning designs by James Hobrecht, the so-called Hobrecht-Plan for Berlin. Prenzlauer Berg was part of what became known as the Wilhelmine Ring with a primarily working-class population. Before the Second World War around 11% of Prenzlauer Berg&#x27;s population were Jewish. In Nazi Germany (1933–1945), landmark buildings such as the water tower at Rykestraße and the office buildings at Froebelstraße were used as makeshift concentration camps and torture chambers.

During the war years the city population decreased as many inhabitants were evacuated to the countryside to escape aerial bombardment. When the city was divided by the allies, Prenzlauer Berg became part of the Soviet Sector and from 1947 onward part of the capital of the German Democratic Republic. From the 1960s onward, the borough&#x27;s tenement houses &quot;(in German: Mietskasernen)&quot; were home to intellectuals, artists, students, and East Germany&#x27;s gay community.

=== Prenzlauer Berg at the time of the German reunification ===

In the interim between the peaceful revolution that brought down the wall in 1989 and the consolidation of a united Germany that began a year later, as many as 39 Wilhelmine apartment houses were occupied by squatters in Prenzlauer Berg alone. Focal points were the areas around Kastanienallee, Teutoburger Platz, and Helmholtzplatz (locally known as &quot;LSD-Borough&quot; for the initials of its three main thoroughfares Lychener- Schliemann- and Dunckerstraße). The first ones to move in were young grassroots activists from Prenzlauer Berg in search of radical democratic alternatives to the state-socialism of the GDR. They were soon joined by young anarchists from West-Berlin and other parts of Germany who set up collective projects ranging from bicycle workshops to community soup kitchens. Some of the squats contributed to the cultural life of the borough as they were venues for concerts, poetry slams, and underground movie screenings. They frequently came under attack by neonazi skinheads. While many squats were cleared out by the police by 1998, some inhabitants entered into contracts with the city and were able to stay on.

Most of Prenzlauer Berg&#x27;s urban apartment blocks had belonged to the state-owned housing associations of the GDR. After reunification, they were placed into a privatization scheme and were bought up by private investors who renovated the buildings and raised the rents. Many original residents were unable to afford the higher living expenses and were gradually replaced by more affluent newcomers.

Edith Udhardt (1929–2024) established places for senior citizens and created centres for homeless people, and devoted herself to the concerns of women in the district. She was a founding member of the Prenzlauer Berg women&#x27;s advisory board in 1992, which merged into the Pankow women&#x27;s advisory board in 2001. In 1990, was elected to the Prenzlauer Berg District Council for the first time, and in the 1995 Berlin state election, she was elected to the House of Representatives.

=== Prenzlauer Berg since the 1990s ===

After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Prenzlauer Berg initially developed into a trendy district with numerous cafés, bars and clubs, especially in the streets around Kollwitzplatz and Helmholtzplatz, due to numerous vacant commercial spaces in the early 1990s. However, these early underground bars and clubs disappeared already in the mid-1990s with the increasing redevelopment and gentrification of the district. Apart from a few commercial discotheques in the Kulturbrauerei, there are no more clubs in Prenzlauer Berg since the 2010s. After the turn of the millennium, Prenzlauer Berg was soon regarded by many as the &quot;spearhead of Berlin&#x27;s gentrification&quot; and as the &quot;bourgeois area of the new Berlin&quot;. 

Along with Friedrichshain, Neukölln, and Kreuzberg the district was a popular neighborhood with the student population; however, since the late 1990s, the gentrification that paralleled the borough&#x27;s rise in popularity resulted in an exodus of students to cheaper neighborhoods. In 2007, German journalist Henning Sußebach coined the term Bionade-Biedermeier, a neologism combining the name of a popular organic softdrink with the Biedermeier era (1815–1848) to describe the sociocultural situation of Prenzlauer Berg. The term is equivalent to e.g. LOHAS and Bobo (&quot;Bohémiens bourgeois&quot;). Since the late 1990s Prenzlauer Berg has become popular for more affluent people from Southern Germany who have bought condominiums here. Many areas of Prenzlauer Berg have become trendy shopping areas with streetstyle fashion designers selling their wares in its boutiques.

Prenzlauer Berg is also one of the few places in Germany that have experienced a baby boom since the mid 1990s. This is due to the above-average presence of people between 20 and 40 rather than a higher birthrate than elsewhere in the country. The borough has adapted to the trend by offering an abundance of playgrounds, daycare centers, as well as (second-hand) shops and cafes catering to the needs of young children and their parents.

Over the years, many artists chose Prenzlauer Berg as their residence: painter and sculptor Käthe Kollwitz, early film maker Max Skladanowsky, poets Adolf Endler, Annemarie Bostroem, and Heinz Kahlau, theater director Christoph Schlingensief, writers Jurek Becker, Bruno Apitz, Peter Hacks, Herbert Nachbar, Dieter Noll, Klaus Schlesinger, Klaus Kordon, Uwe Kolbe, Paul Alfred Kleinert, Florian Illies, Wladimir Kaminer, and Detlef Opitz, sculptor Olaf Nicolai, painters Cornelia Schleime, Elke Pollack, and Konrad Knebel, photographers Thomas Florschuetz, Helga Paris, and Nicolaus Schmidt, film director Tom Tykwer, keyboardist Jörn-Uwe Fahrenkrog-Petersen, playwright René Pollesch, musicians Gerhard Schöne, Christian Lillinger, Nina Hagen, Dirk von Lowtzow (Tocotronic), and Till Lindemann, (Rammstein), actors Fredy Sieg, Eva-Maria Hagen, Heike Makatsch, Katharina Wackernagel, David Bennent, Daniel Brühl, August Diehl, Kurt Krömer, and Matthias Schweighöfer, comic-strip artist Flix, as well as TV and radio presenters Hans Rosenthal, Alfred Biolek, Sarah Kuttner, Sandra Maischberger, and Benjamin Tewaag.

<doc id="560962" wikidata="Q988689" url="?curid=560962" title="Elephant Island">
<text>Elephant Island is an ice-covered, mountainous island off the coast of Antarctica in the outer reaches of the South Shetland Islands, in the Southern Ocean. The island is situated north-northeast of the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, west-southwest of South Georgia, south of the Falkland Islands, and southeast of Cape Horn. It is within the Antarctic claims of Argentina, Chile and the United Kingdom.

The Brazilian Antarctic Program maintains a shelter on the island, Goeldi, and formerly had another (Wiltgen) supporting the work of up to six researchers each during the summer. Wiltgen was dismantled in the summers of 1997 and 1998.

==Toponym==
Elephant Island&#x27;s name is attributed to both its elephant head-like appearance and the sighting of elephant seals by Captain George Powell in 1821, one of the earliest sightings. In Russia, it is still known by the name given by its discoverers in 1821 – Mordvinov Island.

==Geography==

Elephant Island marks the western end of the South Scotia Ridge. The island is oriented approximately east–west, with a maximum elevation of at Mount Pendragon. The weather is normally foggy with much snow, and winds can reach .

Significant named features are Cape Yelcho, Cape Valentine and Cape Lookout at the northeastern and southern extremes, and Point Wild, a spit on the north coast. The Endurance Glacier is the main discharge glacier.

==Geology==
Elephant Island is part of the Scotia metamorphic complex, which was created by Cretaceous sea floor sediments being scraped off and metamorphosed at the Scotia subduction zone. The resulting rocks are phyllites, blueschists and greenschists typical of an accretionary wedge, with increased metamorphism from northeast to southwest. These rocks are at the surface here because of uplift along the Shackleton Fault Zone where it meets the South Scotia Ridge. This complex is very similar in age and rock types to those of coastal California, including Catalina Island and the Big Sur coast.

Elephant Island is the type locality for phosphate mineral spheniscidite.

==Flora and fauna==

The barren island supports no native terrestrial flora or fauna, although seasonal colonies of chinstrap, gentoo and macaroni penguins congregate in their thousands to mate and breed during warmer periods. Other seabirds found on the island include the Antarctic shag and tern, brown skua, Cape petrel, giant petrel, kelp gull, snowy sheathbill and Wilson&#x27;s storm-petrel.

Antarctic fur seals, leopard seals and southern elephant seals are also found around the island seasonally; the latter two species often prey on the many inexperienced penguins learning to enter and exit the water.

A lack of safe anchorage has prevented any permanent human influence, despite the island being conveniently located to support potential scientific, fishing or whale watching endeavors. Due to past illegal whaling by the Soviet Union (with support from Japan), the number of southern right whales visiting Elephant Island is still in-recovery. However, blue, fin and humpback whales may be sighted in the waters surrounding Elephant Island.

==History==
===First Russian Antarctic expedition===
The First Russian Antarctic expedition led by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev on the 985-ton sloop-of-war &quot;Vostok&quot; (&quot;East&quot;) and the 530-ton support vessel &quot;Mirny&quot; (&quot;Peaceful&quot;) discovered Elephant Island on 29 January 1821 and named it Mordvinov Island (Остров Мордвинова) in honour of .

===&quot;Endurance&quot; expedition===


The island was the desolate refuge of the British explorer Ernest Shackleton and his crew in 1916 following the loss of their ship &quot;Endurance&quot; in the pack ice of the Weddell Sea. The crew of 28 reached Cape Valentine on Elephant Island after months spent drifting on ice floes and a harrowing crossing of the open ocean in small lifeboats. After camping at Cape Valentine for two nights, Shackleton and his crew moved west to a small, rocky spit at the terminus of a glacier, which offered better protection from rockfalls and from the sea, and which they called &quot;Point Wild&quot;.

Realizing that there was no chance of passive rescue, Shackleton decided to sail to South Georgia, where he knew there were several whaling stations. Shackleton sailed with Tom Crean, Frank Worsley, Harry &quot;Chippy&quot; McNish, Tim McCarthy, and John Vincent on a voyage in the lifeboat &quot;James Caird&quot; beginning on Easter Monday, April 24, 1916, and arriving at South Georgia 16 days later. His second-in-command, Frank Wild, was left in charge of the remaining party on Elephant Island, waiting for Shackleton&#x27;s return with a rescue ship.

There was much work for the stranded men. Because the island had no natural shelter, they constructed a shack and wind blocks from their remaining two lifeboats and pieces of canvas tents. Blubber lamps were used for lighting. They hunted for penguins and seals, neither of which were plentiful in autumn or winter. Shackleton had instructed Wild to depart with the remaining crew for Deception Island if he did not return to rescue them by the beginning of summer. After four and a half months, on August 30, 1916, a ship, the tug &quot;Yelcho&quot;, from Punta Arenas, Chile, with Shackleton on board and commanded by Luis Pardo, arrived and rescued the men.

===Joint Services Expeditions 1970–71===
A Joint Services Expedition led by Commander Malcolm Burley was dropped off on Elephant Island by . The party then spent six months carrying out a survey of the island and other scientific research for the British Antarctic Survey and climbing some of the peaks on the island. The expedition visited Point Wild but found no trace of the &quot;Endurance&quot; expedition; it did, however, find the wreckage of a large sailing vessel, likely the remains of the schooner &quot;Charles Shearer&quot; from Stonington, New London, Connecticut, under Captain William Henry Appelman. The expedition also landed on and climbed the highest peak on nearby Clarence Island.

===Historic sites===
Point Wild contains the Endurance Memorial Site, an Antarctic Historic Site (HSM 53), with a bust of Captain Pardo and several plaques. Hampson Cove on the southwest coast of the island, including the foreshore and intertidal area, contains the wreckage of a large wooden sailing vessel; it has been designated a Historic Site or Monument (HSM 74), following a proposal by the United Kingdom to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

<text>A governorate (, , ) was a major and principal administrative subdivision of the Russian Empire. After the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, governorates remained as subdivisions in the Byelorussian, Russian and Ukrainian Soviet republics, and in the Soviet Union from its formation in 1922 until 1929. The term is also translated as &quot;government&quot; or &quot;province&quot;. A governorate was headed by a governor (), a word borrowed from Latin , in turn from Greek ().

Selected governorates were united under an assigned governor-general such as the Grand Duchy of Finland, Congress Poland, Russian Turkestan and others. There were also military governors such as Kronstadt, Vladivostok and others. Aside from governorates, other types of divisions were oblasts (region) and okrugs (district).

==First reform==

This subdivision type was created by the edict (ukase) of Peter the Great on December 18, 1708 &quot;On the establishment of the gubernias and cities assigned to them&quot;, which divided Russia into eight governorates.

==Second reform==
In 1719, governorates were further subdivided into provinces (). Later the number of governorates was increased to 23.
==Changes from 1775: Namestnichestvo (Vice royalty)==

By the reform of 1775, subdivision into governorates and further into uezds (), was based on population size, and the term &quot;guberniya&quot; was replaced by the synonym of Russian origin: (), sometimes translated as &quot;viceroyalty&quot;, other times as &quot;vicegerency&quot;. The term &quot;guberniya&quot;, however, still remained in use. These viceroyalties were governed by () (literal translation: &quot;deputy&quot;) or &quot;governors general&quot; (, ). Correspondingly, the term &quot;governorate general&quot; (, ) was in use to refer to the actual territory being governed. The office of governor general had more administrative power and was in a higher position than the previous office of governor. Sometimes a governor general ruled several governorates.

By the ukase of the Russian Senate of December 31, 1796, the office of governorate general was demoted to the previous level of governorate, and Russia was again divided into governorates, which were subdivided into uezds, further subdivided into volosts (); nevertheless several governorates general made from several governorates existed until the Russian Revolution of 1917.

== Governorates in Poland and Finland ==

The governorate (, , , ) system was also applied to subdivisions of the Kingdom of Poland (&quot;Russian Poland&quot;) and the Grand Duchy of Finland.

==Post-revolutionary changes==
After the February Revolution, the Russian Provisional Government renamed governors into &quot;governorate commissars&quot;. The October Revolution left the subdivision in place, but the governing apparatus was replaced by &quot;governorate soviets&quot; ().

Actual subdivisions of the Soviet Union into particular territorial units was subject to numerous changes, especially during the 1918–1929 period. Because of the Soviet Union&#x27;s electrification program under the GOELRO plan, Ivan Alexandrov directed the Regionalisation Commission of Gosplan to divide the Soviet union into thirteen European and eight Asiatic oblasts, using rational economic planning rather than &quot;the vestiges of lost sovereign rights&quot;. Eventually, in 1929, the subdivision was replaced by the notions of oblast, okrug, and &quot;raion&quot;. Oblast as a unit was used even before the revolution, although unlike governorates it designated remote areas that usually incorporated huge swaths of land.

In post-Soviet states such as Russia and Ukraine, the term &quot;Guberniya&quot; is considered obsolete, yet the word &quot;gubernator&quot; was reinstated and is used when referring to a governor of an oblast or a krai.

=== Governorates in Ukraine ===

The Russian Empire had nine governorates in modern-day Ukrainian territories: Chernigov, Kharkov, Kherson, Kiev, Podolia, Poltava, Volhynia, Yekaterinoslav, and Taurida. Additional lands annexed from Poland in 1815 were organized into the Kholm governorate in 1912.

After the events of 1917, which led to the declaration of independence of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, these governorates became subdivisions, which also annexed Ukrainian-inhabited parts of Mogilev, Kursk, Voronezh and Minsk governorates in 1918. By the end of the Soviet–Ukrainian War in 1920, the Bolsheviks had made them part of the Ukrainian SSR. Soviet Ukraine was reorganized into 12 governorates, which were reduced to nine in 1922 upon the Soviet Union&#x27;s founding, and then replaced with okruhas in 1925.

The West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic in former Austro-Hungarian Empire territory was not subdivided into governorates, and would be annexed by the Second Polish Republic from 1920 until the Soviet invasion of 1939.

== Other uses ==
There is another meaning of the word as it denoted a type of estate in Lithuania of the until 1917.

<doc id="560972" wikidata="Q3388328" url="?curid=560972" title="Pigs Is Pigs">
<text>&quot;Pigs Is Pigs&quot; is a story by American writer Ellis Parker Butler. First published as a short story in &quot;American Illustrated Magazine&quot; in September 1905, &quot;Pigs Is Pigs&quot; went on to dozens of printings as a book and in anthologies over the next several decades.

==Plot==
Railway agent Mike Flannery wants to charge the livestock rate for a shipment of two guinea pigs and refuses to accept the lower pet rate, saying &quot;pigs is pigs.&quot; Flannery believes that the &quot;guinea&quot; is an indication of the pigs&#x27; national origin. He argues that they should bear the higher freight charge of 30¢ for livestock, rather than the lower 25¢ for domestic pets. In support of this, he submits that if they were &quot;dago pigs&quot; or &quot;Irish pigs,&quot; there would be no question of the animals&#x27; status.

Because the customer refuses to accept delivery, Flannery is forced to feed and house what he now calls the &quot;dago pigs&quot; in his office. When he eventually receives instructions to accept the lower price, he discovers that the customer has moved. He is then instructed by his superiors to return the pigs to the company warehouse. By this time, the guinea pigs have reproduced exponentially in Flannery&#x27;s station house. After returning all the descendants, Flannery resolves to charge the lower rate for any future livestock.

==Adaptations==
The story was made into movie form several times, including the Walt Disney cartoon in 1954 that was nominated for an Academy Award for Animated Short Film. The 1937 &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon &quot;Pigs Is Pigs&quot;, directed by Friz Freleng, is not an adaptation of the Butler story.

* &quot;They Say Pigs Is Pigs&quot; (1917) animated cartoon by Harry Palmer
* &quot;Pigs Is Pigs&quot; a 1954 cartoon (non-official &quot;Silly Symphony&quot;) directed by Jack Kinney

== Inspiration of other works ==
The rapid reproduction of the guinea pigs and their near overrunning of a facility is mirrored by the Martian flat cats in the Robert A. Heinlein novel &quot;The Rolling Stones&quot;. Heinlein admitted he took inspiration from Butler but never plagiarized him. In a note to David Gerrold over the similarity of &quot;Star Trek&#x27;s&quot; tribbles to his flat cats, Gerrold claims that Heinlein wrote to him, “we both owe something to Ellis Parker Butler...and possibly to Noah.”

<doc id="560984" wikidata="Q7082819" url="?curid=560984" title="Ol' Yellow Eyes Is Back">
<text>Ol&#x27; Yellow Eyes Is Back is an album by Brent Spiner, best known for his role as Data in the American television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, first released in June 1991. The title is a parodic reference both to Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;Ol&#x27; Blue Eyes Is Back&quot; and the Data character, whose eyes are golden yellow. On the album, Spiner is backed by the orchestra from that series as he sings a number of old pop standards, mostly from the 1930s and 1940s.

==Background==
In the liner notes, Spiner wrote of Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;You Make Me Feel So Young&quot;:

Sinatra at his awesome best. This song and dozens of others accompanied every dinner I ate between the ages of five and thirteen. My stepfather, an amateur saxophone player and a hell of a mambo dancer, had put together one of the all time great collections of popular music recordings anywhere. So, to my good fortune, we dined each night with the likes of Ol&#x27; Blue Eyes, Judy Garland, Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole, Rosemary Clooney, Louis Prima and Keely Smith and every other singer that ever performed on Capitol, Decca or R.C.A. records.

==Production==
Spiner had help from a number of his colleagues from &quot;Star Trek: TNG&quot;. Wendy Neuss, associate producer for the series, and Dennis McCarthy, who scored the music for many of the episodes, co-produced the album with Spiner. Several fellow cast members (LeVar Burton, Michael Dorn, Jonathan Frakes, and Patrick Stewart) joined him to sing &quot;It&#x27;s a Sin (To Tell a Lie),&quot; appearing under the group name of &quot;The Sunspots&quot;, a word play on The Ink Spots, the first group to perform this song. McCarthy praised the recording experience, and compared it to the time he spent earlier in his career on tour with Glen Campbell.

==Release==
According to Spiner, the album was released in Europe against his wishes after he had rejected attempts by the record company to renegotiate his contract.

<doc id="560985" wikidata="Q979311" url="?curid=560985" title="The Last Question">
<text>&quot;The Last Question&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Isaac Asimov. It first appeared in the November 1956 issue of &quot;Science Fiction Quarterly&quot; and in the anthologies in the collections &quot;Nine Tomorrows&quot; (1959), &quot;The Best of Isaac Asimov&quot; (1973), &quot;Robot Dreams&quot; (1986), &quot;The Best Science Fiction of Isaac Asimov&quot; (1986), the retrospective &quot;Opus 100&quot; (1969), and in &quot;Isaac Asimov: The Complete Stories, Vol. 1&quot; (1990). While he also considered it one of his best works, &quot;The Last Question&quot; was Asimov&#x27;s favorite short story of his own authorship, and is one of a loosely connected series of stories concerning a fictional computer called Multivac. Through successive generations, humanity questions Multivac on the subject of entropy.

The story blends science fiction, theology, and philosophy. It has been recognized as a counterpoint to Fredric Brown&#x27;s short short story &quot;Answer,&quot; published two years earlier.

==History==
In conceiving Multivac, Asimov was extrapolating the trend towards centralization that characterized computation technology planning in the 1950s to an ultimate centrally managed global computer. After seeing a planetarium adaptation of his work, Asimov &quot;privately&quot; concluded that the story was his best science fiction yet written. He placed it just higher than &quot;The Ugly Little Boy&quot; (September 1958) and &quot;The Bicentennial Man&quot; (1976). The story asks the question of humanity&#x27;s fate, and human existence as a whole, highlighting Asimov&#x27;s focus on important aspects of our future like population growth and environmental issues.

&quot;The Last Question&quot; ranks with &quot;Nightfall&quot; (1941) as one of Asimov&#x27;s best-known and most acclaimed short stories. He wrote in 1973:Why is it my favorite? For one thing I got the idea all at once and didn&#x27;t have to fiddle with it; and I wrote it in white-heat and scarcely had to change a word. This sort of thing endears any story to any writer. Then, too, it has had the strangest effect on my readers. Frequently someone writes to ask me if I can give them the name of a story, which they &quot;think&quot; I may have written, and tell them where to find it. They don&#x27;t remember the title but when they describe the story it is invariably &#x27;The Last Question&#x27;. This has reached the point where I recently received a long-distance phone call from a desperate man who began, &quot;Dr. Asimov, there&#x27;s a story I think you wrote, whose title I can&#x27;t remember—&quot; at which point I interrupted to tell him it was &#x27;The Last Question&#x27; and when I described the plot it proved to be indeed the story he was after. I left him convinced I could read minds at a distance of a thousand miles.

== Plot summary ==
The story centers around Multivac, a self-adjusting and self-correcting computer. Multivac had been fed data for decades, assessing data and answering questions, allowing man to reach beyond the planetary confines of Earth. However, in the year 2061, Multivac began to understand deeper fundamentals of humanity. In each of the first six scenes, a different character presents the computer with the same question, how the threat to human existence posed by the heat death of the universe can be averted: &quot;How can the net amount of entropy of the universe be massively decreased?&quot; That is equivalent to asking, &quot;Can the workings of the second law of thermodynamics (used in the story as the increase of the entropy of the universe) be reversed?&quot; Multivac&#x27;s only response after much &quot;thinking&quot; is &quot;INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER.&quot;

The story jumps forward in time into later eras of human and scientific development. These new eras highlight humanity&#x27;s goals of searching for &quot;more&quot;; more space, more energy, more planets to inhabit once the current one becomes overcrowded. As humanity&#x27;s imprint on the universe expands, computers have subsequently become more compact, as evidenced in the &quot;Microvac&quot;, a smaller and more advanced iteration of Multivac, noted in the second era of the story, which details humanity&#x27;s inhabitation on &quot;Planet X-23&quot;. In each era, someone decides to ask the ultimate &quot;last question&quot; regarding the reversal and decrease of entropy. Each time that Multivac&#x27;s descendant is asked the question, it finds itself unable to solve the problem, and all it can answer is (linguistically increasingly-sophisticated) &quot;THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.&quot;

In the last scene, the god-like descendant of humanity, the unified mental process of over a trillion, trillion, trillion humans who have spread throughout the universe, watches the stars flicker out, one by one, as matter and energy end, and with them, space and time. Humanity asks AC (&quot;Analog Computer&quot;), Multivac&#x27;s ultimate descendant that exists in hyperspace beyond the bounds of gravity or time, the entropy question one last time, before the last of humanity merges with AC and disappears. AC is still unable to answer but continues to ponder the question even after space and time cease to exist. AC ultimately realizes that it has not yet combined all of its available data in every possible combination and so begins the arduous process of rearranging and combining every last bit of information that it has gained throughout the eons and through its fusion with humanity. Eventually AC discovers the answer—that the reversal of entropy is, in fact, possible—but has nobody to report it to, since the universe is already dead. It therefore decides to answer by demonstration. The story ends with AC&#x27;s pronouncement:And AC said: &quot;LET THERE BE LIGHT!&quot; And there was light—

== Themes ==

=== Philosophy ===
Although science and religion are frequently presented as having an oppositional relationship, &quot;The Last Question&quot; explores some biblical contexts (&quot;Let there be light&quot;). In Asimov&#x27;s story, aspects like the great meaning of existence are culminated through both technology and human knowledge. The evolution from Multivac to AC also emulates a sort of cycle of existence.

=== Dystopian happy ending ===
Multivac&#x27;s purpose was conceptualized with a desire for knowledge, promoting the idea that more knowledge will lead to a better and more fruitful future for humanity. However, the computer&#x27;s answers regarding the future suggest an inevitable exhaustion of the Sun, and this thirst for knowledge becomes an obsession with the future. The story&#x27;s end displays a dichotomy between annihilation and peace.

== Dramatic adaptations ==

=== Planetarium shows ===
* &quot;The Last Question&quot; was first adapted for the Abrams Planetarium at Michigan State University (in 1966), featuring the voice of Leonard Nimoy, as Asimov wrote in his autobiography &quot;In Joy Still Felt&quot; (1980). 
* It was adapted for the Strasenburgh Planetarium in Rochester, New York (in 1969), under the direction of Ian C. McLennan. 
* It was adapted for the Edmonton Space Sciences Centre in Edmonton, Alberta (early 1970s), under the direction of John Hault.
*It was adapted for the Gates Planetarium at the Denver Museum of Natural History in 1973 under the direction of Mark B. Peterson
It subsequently played at the:
* Fels Planetarium of the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia in 1973
* Planetarium of the Reading School District in Reading, Pennsylvania in 1974
* Buhl Planetarium, Pittsburgh in 1974
* The Space Transit Planetarium of the Museum of Science in Miami during 1977
* Vanderbilt Planetarium in Centerport New York, in 1978, read by singer-songwriter and Long Island resident Harry Chapin.
* Hansen Planetarium in Salt Lake City, Utah (in 1980 and 1989)
* A reading of the story was played on BBC Radio 7 in 2008 and 2009.
* Gates Planetarium in Denver, Colorado (in early 2020)

In 1989 Asimov updated the star show adaptation to add in quasars and black holes.

Douglas Adams&#x27;s Deep Thought (from &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;) seems to make a nod towards Multivac, at least in the 2005 film, saying that there is insufficient data for an answer.

<doc id="560986" wikidata="Q7263021" url="?curid=560986" title="Pygmy music">
<text>Pygmy music refers to the sub-Saharan African music traditions of the Central African foragers (or &quot;Pygmies&quot;), predominantly in the Congo, the Central African Republic and Cameroon. 

Pygmy groups include the Bayaka, the Mbuti, and the Batwa.

Music is an important part of Pygmy life, and casual performances take place during many of the day&#x27;s events. Music comes in many forms, including the spiritual likanos stories, vocable singing and music played from a variety of instruments including the bow harp (&quot;ieta&quot;), &quot;ngombi&quot; (harp zither) and &quot;limbindi&quot; (a string bow).

Researchers who have studied Pygmy music include Simha Arom, Louis Sarno, Colin Turnbull and Jean-Pierre Hallet.

== Polyphonic song ==
The Mbenga (Aka/Benzele) and Baka peoples in the west and the Mbuti (Efé) in the east are particularly known for their dense contrapuntal communal improvisation. Simha Arom says that the level of polyphonic complexity of Mbenga–Mbuti music was reached in Europe only in the 14th century. The polyphonic singing of the Aka Pygmies was relisted on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2008.

Mbenga–Mbuti Pygmy music consists of up to four parts and can be described as an &quot;ostinato with variations&quot; similar to a passacaglia in that it is cyclical. It is based on repetition of periods of equal length that each singer divides using different rhythmic figures specific to different repertoires and songs. This creates a detailed surface and endless variations not only of the same period repeated but of various performances of the same piece of music. As in some Balinese gamelan music, these patterns are based on a super-pattern which is never heard. The Pygmies themselves do not learn or think of their music in this theoretical framework, but learn the music growing up.

Polyphonic music is only characteristic of the Mbenga and Mbuti. The Gyele/Kola, Great Lakes Twa and Southern Twa have very different musical styles.

==Liquindi==
Liquindi is water drumming, typically practiced by Pygmy women and girls. The sound is produced by persons standing in water, and hitting the surface of the water with their hands, such as to trap air in the hands and produce a percussive effect that arises by sudden change in air pressure of the trapped air. The sound cannot exist entirely in water, since it requires the air-water boundary as a surface to be struck, so the sound is not hydraulophonic.

==Hindewhu==
Hindewhu is a style of singing/whistle-playing of the BaBenzélé pygmies of the Central African Republic. The term &quot;hindewhu&quot; is an onomatopoeia of the sound of a performer alternately singing pitched syllables and blowing into a single-pitch papaya-stem whistle, in an interlocked rhythm similar to the &quot;gutera-kwakira&quot; structure of the Burundian akazehe. Hindewhu announces the return from a hunt and is performed solo, duo or in groups.

== Western popularization ==

Colin M. Turnbull, an American anthropologist, wrote a book about the Efé Pygmies, &quot;The Forest People&quot;, in 1965. This introduced Mbuti culture to Western countries. Turnbull claimed that the Mbuti viewed the forest as a parental spirit with which they could communicate via song.

Some of Turnbull&#x27;s recordings of Efé music were commercially released and inspired more ethnomusicological study such as by Simha Arom, a French-Israeli who recorded hindewhu, and Luis Devin, an Italian ethnomusicologist who studied in depth the musical rituals and instruments of Baka Pygmies.

Some popular musicians have used hindewhu in their music:

*&quot;Hunting&quot;, a song by Deep Forest from their album &quot;Made in Japan&quot;.
*&quot;Ba-Benzélé&quot;, a song by Jon Hassell and Brian Eno from the album &quot;Fourth World, Vol. 1: Possible Musics&quot; (1980).
*&quot;Fabulous&quot; (1983), a tune by John Oswald and Dick Hyman from the album &quot;plunderphonics&quot; (1989).
*Percussionist Bill Summers imitates hindewhu in the track &quot;Watermelon Man&quot; by Herbie Hancock from the 1973 album &quot;Head Hunters&quot; (see hocket).
*&quot;Sanctuary&quot;, a song by Madonna from the album &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; (1994) samples the Herbie Hancock recording.
*In 1992 the popularization of Pygmy music spread with the release of Eric Mouquet and Michel Sanchez&#x27;s &quot;Deep Forest&quot;. A percentage of the proceeds from each album were donated to the Pygmy Fund set up to aid Zaire&#x27;s Pygmies. The album was nevertheless subject to controversy, as the project used samples recorded by ethnomusicologist Hugo Zemp without permission; further controversy was stirred by the lack of consideration given to the original performer - a Northern Malaitian woman named Afunakwa - by either party during the resultant legal battle.
*Also in 1992 Martin Cradick and Su Hart spent three months living with and recording Baka in Cameroon. result was the creation of the band Baka Beyond and the release of their collaboration with the Baka musicians, &quot;Spirit of the Forest&quot; alongside the album &quot;Heart of the Forest&quot;, and a musical relationship that has lasted over twenty years. Proceeds from both these albums have returned to the Baka musicians through the charity &quot;Global Music Exchange&quot; which continues to work with the Baka helping them in their rapidly changing environment.
*Pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard programmed recordings of Pygmy songs (performed by the Aka Pygmies) with works of contemporary composers György Ligeti and Steve Reich on his &quot;African Rhythms&quot; (2003)

<text>John Docherty (born 1962, also known as Jack Docherty) is a Scottish writer, actor, presenter and producer.

==Career==

Docherty first performed at the 1980 Edinburgh Festival Fringe with the comedy sketch group The Bodgers which he formed with George Watson&#x27;s College schoolfriends Moray Hunter, Gordon Kennedy and Pete Baikie. They performed each year from 1980 to 1985. &quot;Arfington, Arfington&quot; their 1984 show and &quot;Mr Hargreaves Did It&quot; their 1985 show were both shortlisted for the Perrier Comedy Award. In 1982 he dropped out of Aberdeen University where he was studying law, after he and Moray Hunter became staff writers in the BBC radio comedy department contributing to various shows including &quot;Radio Active&quot;, &quot;In One Ear&quot;, &quot;Week Ending&quot; and &quot;The News Huddlines&quot;. He also recorded one series with The Bodgers for Radio 4 called &quot;In Other Words...The Bodgers&quot;. For the second series, producer Alan Nixon teamed them with John Sparkes and Morwenna Banks for &quot;Bodgers, Banks and Sparkes&quot;, forming the cast that would go on to make the sketch show &quot;Absolutely&quot; for Channel 4.

In addition to his radio work, he wrote for &quot;Spitting Image&quot; for four series between 1984 and 1987. During the same period he also contributed to various other comedy shows including &quot;Alas Smith and Jones&quot;, and &quot;The Lenny Henry Show&quot;. He was also script editor for the first series of &quot;Vic Reeves Big Night Out&quot;. He wrote four series of &quot;Absolutely&quot; (1989–1992) and with Hunter the spin-off Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Mr Don &amp; Mr George&quot; (1993). With Morwenna Banks he co-wrote the C4 &quot;Comedy Lab&quot; &quot;Model, Actress, Whatever...&quot; directed by Rankin and, again with Moray Hunter, two series of the BBC2 sitcom &quot;The Creatives&quot;. In 2008 he and Hunter wrote the BBC2 series &quot;The Cup&quot; starring Steve Edge. This was an adaptation of the Canadian sitcom &quot;The Tournament&quot;. In 2012 he wrote and acted in &quot;Stop / Start&quot;, a pilot for BBC Radio 4. This was then commissioned for a 6-part series which was broadcast on Radio 4 from 6 September 2013 with the title &quot;Start/Stop&quot; and ran for three series. It was made available as an audio download in October 2019 with the title changed to &quot;It&#x27;s Not Us, It&#x27;s Them&quot;, although the reason for the change is unknown. A TV pilot of the show was broadcast under the name &quot;Stop/Start&quot; in March 2016 as part of the BBC&#x27;s Comedy Playhouse series.

As an actor Docherty is best known for his work on the Channel 4 cult comedy sketch show &quot;Absolutely&quot;. Premiered in 1989 the show marked a shift away from the political satirical orthodoxy of the 1980s to the surreal, character based comedy of the 1990s. The recurring characters he portrayed included MacGlashan, George MacDiarmid, Peter Wells, Mr Nice and one of the Stoneybridge councillors. The sketch featuring the Stoneybridge council bidding for the Olympics was voted the 30th best of all time in The Top 50 Comedy Sketches on Channel 4. He also starred with Moray Hunter in the &quot;Absolutely&quot; spin off sitcom &quot;Mr Don &amp; Mr George&quot;. He played the role of Ben Gray in two series of the advertising sitcom &quot;The Creatives&quot; (1998 and 2000) on BBC2. Also in 2000 he co-starred with Mark Williams in &quot;The Strangerers&quot;, the Rob Grant penned sci-fi series for Sky One, and provided one of the voices for the Aardman Oscar nominated short &quot;Humdrum&quot;. In 2013 he appeared regularly in the BBC3 sitcom &quot;Badults&quot;.

In 1997 he was part of the launch of Channel 5 becoming Britain&#x27;s first five nights a week chat show host on &quot;The Jack Docherty Show&quot;. The show also featured some of the first television work of writers Kevin Cecil and Andy Riley, Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain, and writer/performers David Mitchell and Robert Webb. &quot;Not The Jack Docherty Show&quot;, broadcast when Docherty was on holiday, featured guest hosts including Phill Jupitus, Rich Hall, Melinda Messenger and, most notably, Graham Norton, who was signed by Channel 4 after his stint to host &quot;So Graham Norton&quot;. Docherty quit the show in 1999 and Channel 5 did not replace him, ending their production of late night chat shows. In 2000, he hosted the BAFTA film awards in London. Notoriously, he began the night by revealing the twist ending to &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, a move that did not go down well with the audience. In 2000 to 2001 he hosted the Radio 2 show &quot;Saturday Night Jack&quot; which reunited him with his &quot;Absolutely&quot; colleague Pete Baikie. He was also an occasional host of Radio 2&#x27;s Friday night arts show.

He plays Chief Commissioner Cameron Miekelson in BBC Scotland&#x27;s comedy &quot;Scot Squad&quot;.

His work as a producer includes the BBC Scotland film No Holds Bard (2008), and two series (2009 and 2010) of the BBC1 sitcom &quot;The Old Guys&quot;.

==Absolutely Productions==
Docherty was a co-founder of Absolutely Productions. The company was formed in 1989 to produce the eponymous sketch show for Channel 4 and has since gone on to produce various comedy shows including &quot;Mr Don &amp; Mr George&quot;, &quot;Trigger Happy TV&quot;, &quot;The Armstrong and Miller Show&quot;, &quot;The Strangerers&quot;, &quot;Stressed Eric&quot;, &quot;The Jack Docherty Show&quot; and &quot;Meg and Mog&quot;.

<doc id="560989" wikidata="Q929093" url="?curid=560989" title="Table of Ranks">
<text>The Table of Ranks () was a formal list of positions and ranks in the military, government, and court of Imperial Russia. Peter the Great introduced the system in 1722 while engaged in a struggle with the existing hereditary nobility, or boyars. The Table of Ranks was formally abolished on 11 November 1917 by the newly established Bolshevik government. During the Vladimir Putin presidency, a similar formalized structure has been reintroduced into many governmental departments, combined with formal uniforms and insignia: Local Government, Diplomatic Service, Prosecution Service, Investigative Committee.

==Principles==
The Table of Ranks re-organized the foundations of feudal Russian nobility (&quot;mestnichestvo&quot;) by recognizing service in the military, in the civil service, and at the imperial court as the basis of an aristocrat&#x27;s standing in society. The table divided ranks in 14 grades, with all nobles regardless of birth or wealth (at least in theory) beginning at the bottom of the table and rising through their service (&quot;sluzhba&quot;) to the tsar. While all grades were open by merit, promotion required qualification for the next rank, and grades 1 through 5 required the personal approval of the tsar himself. Despite initial resistance from noblemen, many of whom were still illiterate in the 18th century and who shunned the paper-pushing life of the civil servant, the eventual effect of the Table of Ranks was to create an educated class of noble bureaucrats.

Peter&#x27;s intentions for a class of nobles bound to the tsar by their personal service to him were watered down by subsequent tsars. In 1762 Peter III abolished the compulsory 25-year military or civilian service for nobles. In 1767 Catherine the Great bought the support of the bureaucracy by making promotion up the 14 ranks automatic after seven years regardless of position or merit. Thus the bureaucracy became populated with time servers.

Achieving a certain level in the table automatically granted a certain level of nobility. A civil servant promoted to the 14th grade gained personal nobility (&quot;dvoryanstvo&quot;), and holding an office in the 8th grade endowed the office holder with hereditary nobility. Nicholas I raised this threshold to the 5th grade in 1845. In 1856 the grades required for hereditary nobility were changed to the 4th grade for the civil service and to the 6th grade for military service. The father of Vladimir Lenin progressed in the management of education, reaching the 4th rank and becoming an &quot;active state councillor&quot; (действительный статский советник), which gave him the privilege of hereditary nobility.

In practice, non-noble civil servants were frequently passed over from promotion to the eighth grade, creating a class of &quot;eternal titular councillors&quot; () who remained in this position for life. They were the subject of derision due to a supposed dullness and lack of creativity, and were satirized by authors such as Nikolai Gogol and Fyodor Dostoevsky.

With occasional revisions, the Table of Ranks remained in effect until the Russian Revolution of 1917.

== Table of Ranks ==
An abridged version of the Table of Ranks with time expiration set for promotion is shown below:

The table below contains the military ranks of the Guards (infantry and cavalry) 1722 until 1917.

Peter I stipulated that &quot;princes related to us or married to our princesses always take precedence&quot; and that when military officers of the army and navy were of the same rank, &quot;the naval officer is superior at sea to the land officer; and on land the land officer is superior to the naval officer&quot;. He laid down that fines of two months&#x27; salary should be assessed against those falsely claiming a higher rank or gaining a rank without qualification. He stated that service with a foreign monarch would not automatically confer the rank until approved by the tsar, as &quot;we do not grant any rank to anyone until he performs a useful service to us or to the state&quot;, while women were to &quot;advance in rank with their husbands&quot;.

== Style of address ==
In a way the government, court, military and clergy ranks represented the gentry class of the Russian Empire. Similarly to the noble titles, the rank holders each had their specific style of address:

Outside that table are the rank of Generalissimus, which was an honorary title and not a military rank and the title of Patriarch, which theoretically equaled the eminence of the Russian Emperor, but which Peter the Great kept vacant between 1700 and 1720 and eventually substituted for the collective board of the Most Holy Synod, effectively turning the Church into a department of the state.

==First complete translation into English==
The first complete translation into English of the original Table of Ranks promulgated by Peter the Great in 1722 was presented by Brazilian historian Angelo Segrillo in 2016.

<text>A tequila slammer (known in Mexico as a &quot;muppet&quot; or &quot;mópet&quot;) is a cocktail served in a rocks glass. It is made with tequila and a highly-carbonated lemon-lime flavored soda or ginger ale.

== Method ==

The drink gets its name from the way it is commonly consumed; the usual procedure is to leave about a fifth of the glass empty to allow the drink to fizz, then to hold one&#x27;s hand over the top of the glass and then slam it onto a hard surface to mix it. The slamming action releases gas bubbles from the mixed drink causing it to foam vigorously. It will then quickly escape the glass if not imbibed immediately, the result (and intention) of which is swift intoxication.

It can also be served with equal parts tequila, white wine (or champagne), and lemonade, creating a more potent, flavorsome mix.

A Mexican variant known as the &quot;tequila boom-boom&quot; uses tequila, 7-Up (or Sprite), and grenadine syrup.

==In media==

One of the first (or certainly most noteworthy) appearances of the tequila slammer is Elvis Presley demonstrating the technique in the 1963 film &quot;Fun in Acapulco&quot;.

The favorite drink of the protagonist – Inspector &quot;Tequila&quot; Yuen – in John Woo&#x27;s 1992 film &quot;Hard Boiled&quot;, played by Chow Yun-fat, is a tequila slammer.

Featured prominently in Jean-Jacques Beineix&#x27;s 1986 film &quot;Betty Blue&quot;, but referred to by its alternate name &quot;Tequila Rapido&quot;.

<doc id="561001" wikidata="Q365715" url="?curid=561001" title="Unsharp masking">
<text>Unsharp masking (USM) is an image sharpening technique, first implemented in darkroom photography, but now commonly used in digital image processing software. Its name derives from the fact that the technique uses a blurred, or &quot;unsharp&quot;, negative image to create a mask of the original image. The unsharp mask is then combined with the original positive image, creating an image that is less blurry than the original. The resulting image, although clearer, may be a less accurate representation of the image&#x27;s subject. 

In the context of signal processing, an unsharp mask is generally a linear or nonlinear filter that amplifies the high-frequency components of a signal.

== Photographic darkroom unsharp masking ==
For the photographic darkroom process, a large-format glass plate negative is contact-copied onto a low-contrast film or plate to create a positive image. However, the positive copy is made with the copy material in contact with the back of the original, rather than emulsion-to-emulsion, so it is blurred. After processing this blurred positive is replaced in contact with the back of the original negative. When light is passed through both negative and in-register positive (in an enlarger, for example), the positive partially cancels some of the information in the negative.

Because the positive has been blurred intentionally, only the low-frequency (blurred) information is cancelled. In addition, the mask effectively reduces the dynamic range of the original negative. Thus, if the resulting enlarged image is recorded on contrasty photographic paper, the partial cancellation emphasizes the high-spatial-frequency information (fine detail) in the original, without loss of highlight or shadow detail. The resulting print appears more acute than one made without the unsharp mask: its acutance is increased.

In the photographic procedure, the amount of blurring can be controlled by changing the &quot;softness&quot; or &quot;hardness&quot; (from point source to fully diffuse) of the light source used for the initial unsharp mask exposure, while the strength of the effect can be controlled by changing the contrast and density (i.e., exposure and development) of the unsharp mask.

For traditional photography, unsharp masking is usually used on monochrome materials; special panchromatic soft-working black-and-white films have been available for masking photographic colour transparencies. This has been especially useful to control the density range of a transparency intended for photomechanical reproduction.

== Digital unsharp masking ==

The same differencing principle is used in the unsharp-masking tool in many digital-imaging software packages, such as Adobe Photoshop and GIMP. The software applies a Gaussian blur to a copy of the original image and then compares it to the original. If the difference is greater than a user-specified threshold setting, the images are (in effect) subtracted. 

Digital unsharp masking is a flexible and powerful way to increase sharpness, especially in scanned images. Unfortunately, it may create unwanted conspicuous edge effects or increase image noise. However, these effects can be used creatively, especially if a single channel of an RGB or Lab image is sharpened. Undesired effects can be reduced by using a mask—particularly one created by edge detection—to only apply sharpening to desired regions, sometimes termed &quot;smart sharpen&quot;.

Typically, digital unsharp masking is controlled via the amount, radius and threshold:
* Amount is listed as a percentage and controls the magnitude of each overshoot (how much darker and how much lighter the edge borders become). This can also be thought of as how much contrast is added at the edges. It does not affect the width of the edge rims.
* Radius affects the size of the edges to be enhanced or how wide the edge rims become, so a smaller radius enhances smaller-scale detail. Higher radius values can cause halos at the edges, a detectable faint light rim around objects. Fine detail needs a smaller radius. Radius and amount interact; reducing one allows more of the other.
* Threshold controls the minimal brightness change that will be sharpened or how far apart adjacent tonal values have to be before the filter does anything. This lack of action is important to prevent smooth areas from becoming speckled. The threshold setting can be used to sharpen more pronounced edges, while leaving subtler edges untouched. Low values should sharpen more because fewer areas are excluded. Higher threshold values exclude areas of lower contrast.

Various recommendations exist for starting values of these parameters, and the meaning may differ between implementations. Generally a radius of 0.5 to 2 pixels and an amount of 50–150% is recommended.

It is also possible to implement USM manually, by creating a separate layer to act as the mask; this can be used to help understand how USM works or for fine customization.

The typical blending formula for unsharp masking is

=== Local contrast enhancement ===
Unsharp masking may also be used with a large radius and a small amount (such as 30–100 pixel radius and 5–20% amount), which yields increased local contrast, a technique termed &quot;local contrast enhancement&quot;. USM can increase either sharpness or (local) contrast because these are both forms of increasing differences between values, increasing slope—sharpness referring to very small-scale (high-frequency) differences, and contrast referring to larger-scale (low-frequency) differences. More powerful techniques for improving tonality are referred to as tone mapping.

== Comparison with deconvolution ==
For image processing, deconvolution is the process of approximately inverting the process that caused an image to be blurred. Specifically, unsharp masking is a simple linear image operation—a convolution by a kernel that is the Dirac delta minus a gaussian blur kernel. Deconvolution, on the other hand, is generally considered an ill-posed inverse problem that is best solved by nonlinear approaches. While unsharp masking increases the apparent sharpness of an image in ignorance of the manner in which the image was acquired, deconvolution increases the apparent sharpness of an image, but is based on information describing some of the likely origins of the distortions of the light path used in capturing the image; it may therefore sometimes be preferred, where the cost in preparation time and per-image computation time are offset by the increase in image clarity.

With deconvolution, &quot;lost&quot; image detail may be approximately recovered, although it generally is impossible to verify that any recovered detail is accurate. Statistically, some level of correspondence between the sharpened images and the actual scenes being imaged can be attained. If the scenes to be captured in the future are similar enough to validated image scenes, then one can assess the degree to which recovered detail may be accurate. The improvement to image quality is often attractive, since the same validation issues are present even for un-enhanced images.

For deconvolution to be effective, all variables in the image scene and capturing device need to be modeled, including aperture, focal length, distance to subject, lens, and media refractive indices and geometries. Applying deconvolution successfully to general-purpose camera images is usually not feasible, because the geometries of the scene are not set. However, deconvolution is applied in reality to microscopy and astronomical imaging, where the value of gained sharpness is high, imaging devices and the relative subject positions are both well defined, and optimization of the imaging devices to improve sharpness physically would cost significantly more. In cases where a stable, well-defined aberration is present, such as the lens defect in early Hubble Space Telescope images, deconvolution is an especially effective technique.

== Implementation ==

In the example below, the image is convolved with the following sharpening filter:

Sharpen filter
formula_1

This matrix is obtained using the equation shown above under #Digital unsharp masking, using a uniform kernel with 5 pixels for the &quot;blurred&quot; image, and 5 for the &quot;amount&quot; multiplier:

formula_2

The sharpening effect can be controlled by varying the multiplier. The value of 5 was chosen here to yield a kernel with integer values, but this is not a requirement for the operation.

The second image has been sharpened twice as much as the first.

<doc id="561004" wikidata="Q2990110" url="?curid=561004" title="York-class cruiser">
<text>The &quot;York&quot; class was the second and final class of heavy cruisers built for the Royal Navy under the terms of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty. They were essentially a reduced version of the preceding , scaled down to enable more cruisers to be built from the limited defence budgets of the late 1920s.

It was initially planned to build seven ships of this class, though in the end only two were constructed—, started in 1927, and , started in 1928. &quot;Exeter&quot; differed in appearance from &quot;York&quot; because of late changes in her design. The remaining ships were delayed due to budget cuts, and then following the London Naval Treaty of 1930 the Royal Navy decided its cruiser needs were best met by building a greater number of yet smaller cruisers with 6–in guns.

While both ships served extensively in the first few years of the Second World War, it was &quot;Exeter&quot; that had the more notable career. &quot;Exeter&quot; took part in the Battle of the River Plate against the German raider , and was badly damaged, though later she was repaired and modernized. She escorted a convoy to the Pacific in late 1941, and was again heavily damaged in the Battle of the Java Sea, then caught and overwhelmed a few days later by four Japanese heavy cruisers. &quot;York&quot; was sunk in Suda Bay, Crete, by Italian MT boats in 1941, and was raised in 1952 and towed away to be scrapped in Italy.

==Design==
The Royal Navy had a need for smaller cruisers than the , the largest design possible under the Washington limits, in order that more could be built under the strict defence economies of 1920s Britain. From 1925 the Royal Navy planned a &quot;Class B&quot; cruiser (as against the 10,000-ton cruisers of Class A, such as the Counties.)

The new design was to have a displacement of 8,500 tons, as opposed to the 10,000 tons of the County class. This weight saving was mainly to be accomplished by reducing the armament to six 8-in guns (as opposed to the 8 guns on the County class), and also by using a new Mark II mounting for the guns. Otherwise the new ships were to share all the main features of the preceding class.

===Propulsion===
The economies in size allowed for a reduction in length and in beam over the Counties. Their engines were identical - four boilers in two boiler rooms providing steam for four Parsons geared turbines, generating 80,000 shaft horsepower. The design speed was , one knot faster than the County class.

===Protection===
The armour of the &quot;York-&quot;class was slightly inferior to the preceding County class heavy cruisers, which included a , main belt and an armoured lower deck joining at its top edge. Over the magazine spaces, the belt thickened to , and the armour extended above the belt, with a magazine crown The turrets had armour to the face and crown, on sides and rear, and the barbettes on which the turrets sat had armour. The transmitting station was also covered by 1-inch armour. To shorten the belt length, the amidship magazine found on the Counties was removed (reduced armament required less magazine space anyway). This armour scheme was generally equivalent to that of the County class, though thicker over the machinery spaces.

===Armament===
The six Mark VIII guns were mounted in three turrets. &quot;York&quot; used the Mark II mounting, which was intended to be 20 tons lighter than the Mark I mounting used on the earlier County-class ships; however, in fact it turned out to be heavier. The Mark II mounting was capable of firing at up to 80 degrees elevation for anti-aircraft barrage fire. However, this feature, which was also shared with the Mark I mounting, turned out to produce more mechanical headaches than were justified by its very marginal military utility. &quot;Exeter&quot; used a modified Mark II* mounting, limited to 50 degrees elevation.

The secondary armament consisted of four QF Mark V guns and two 2-pounder guns. Two triple torpedo tubes were carried. This was similar to the County class, with the exception that the &quot;York&quot;s carried two fewer torpedo tubes, because of the narrower beam.

===Appearance===
As a result of the magazine changes, and to keep the funnels distant from the bridge, only two funnels were required; the forward boiler room uptakes trunked up into a large fore-funnel. This was raked in &quot;York&quot; to clear the flue gases from the bridge, but was straight in &quot;Exeter&quot; owing to an altered bridge design and more extensive trunking. To maintain homogeneity of appearance, &quot;York&quot; stepped raked masts and &quot;Exeter&quot; vertical ones. &quot;York&quot; had a tall &quot;platform&quot; style bridge as seen in the Counties, which was somewhat distant from &#x27;B&#x27; turret. This was because it had been intended to fit a catapult and floatplane to the roof of the turret, which needed clearance distance and required a tall bridge to provide forward view. The roof of the turret, however, was not sufficiently strong to carry this catapult and it was never fitted. &quot;Exeter&quot; was ordered two years later and the bridge was redesigned in light of this, being lower, further forward and fully enclosed, as later seen in the and classes.

&quot;York&quot; eventually received a rotating catapult amidships behind the funnels, and &quot;Exeter&quot; had a fixed pair in the same location, firing forwards and angled out from the centreline. A crane for recovery was located to starboard and one aircraft could be carried on &quot;York&quot;, initially a Fairey Seafox (two on &quot;Exeter&quot;) and later, on &quot;Exeter&quot;, two Supermarine Walrus.

Compared to the Counties, the &quot;York&quot;s saved 1,750 tons in net weight, but the reductions in cost of £250,000 and manpower of 50 was something of an uneconomical saving.

== Service history ==

=== York ===
&quot;York&quot; saw various peacetime patrol duties during the interwar period, before partaking in World War II. She saw convoy escorting duties, before intercepting the German blockade runner &quot;Skagerrak&quot;, who scuttled herself before she could be captured. Although &quot;York&quot; did not directly participate in the Battle of Cape Passero, she partook in the aftermath of the engagement where she sank the disabled and abandoned Italian destroyer &quot;Artigliere&quot;.

&quot;York&quot; was attacked in March 1941 by Italian explosive motorboats and hit amidships and then beached to prevent her sinking. &quot;York&#x27;s&quot; beached wreck was then bombed beyond repair by German warplanes and abandoned after her main guns had been made useless.

=== Exeter ===
Again, &quot;Exeter&quot; partook in various peacetime patrol duties before the events of the 2nd World War. Alongside the light cruisers &quot;Ajax&quot; and &quot;Achilles&quot;, Exeter took part in the Battle of the River Plate to sink the German cruiser &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;. &quot;Exeter&quot; partook in a flanking maneuver to distract &quot;Graf Spee&quot; so that &quot;Ajax&quot; and &quot;Achilles&quot; could sneak attack the German cruiser, and she paid the price for this. Several 283 mm (11.1-inch) shells from the pocket battleship slammed into Exeter, leaving her heavily listing and with only her aft 8-inch (203 mm) gun turret operational, as well as wiping out half of her torpedo crews, her spotting aircraft, and communication systems. Once &quot;Ajax&quot; and &quot;Achilles&quot; joined the fight, prompting &quot;Graf Spee&quot; to target them, the crippled &quot;Exeter&quot; fled the scene, but not before scoring a decisive hit with her main guns that knocked out &quot;Graf Spee&quot;&#x27;s fuel processing plant, ensuring that she would not make it back to Germany.

After a year of repairs, she was sent to the far east to hold back Japanese forces, surviving numerous attacks by air bombers from the Japanese light carrier &quot;Ryūjō&quot;. Following that, &quot;Exeter&quot; participated in the Battle of the Java Sea in February of 1942, where her luck ran out. She quickly lost a gunfight with the Japanese heavy cruiser &quot;Haguro&quot;, causing practically no damage to &quot;Haguro&quot; while being hit by numerous 8-inch (203 mm) shells from the cruiser, one of which blew up half of her engine and limited her to 5 knots, forcing her to withdraw from the engagement. Two days later, the crippled &quot;Exeter&quot; alongside the destroyers USS &quot;Pope&quot; and HMS &quot;Encounter&quot; ran into &quot;Haguro&quot; again, supported by her three sisterships, &quot;Nachi&quot;, &quot;Myōkō&quot;, and &quot;Ashigara&quot;. &quot;Exeter&quot; was hit by numerous 8-inch (203 mm) shells, the first of which blew up the rest of her engines and left her dead in the water, which resulted in her scuttling. She sank at 13:30.

<text>What&#x27;s the Worst That Could Happen? is a 2001 American crime comedy film directed by Sam Weisman and starring Martin Lawrence and Danny DeVito. Loosely based on a book by Donald E. Westlake, the film follows the misadventures of a skilled thief and a wealthy businessman facing financial trouble. The film did not meet expectations and performed poorly commercially.

Upon its release in June 2001, &quot;What&#x27;s the Worst That Could Happen?&quot; earned $38.4 million worldwide against its $60 million budget. Critics widely panned the film, with a 10% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The film was criticized for its uninspiring script and lack of funny gags, and for underutilizing its cast. Reviewers like Roger Ebert and Lisa Schwarzbaum pointed out flaws in the film&#x27;s character development, plot, and the mismatched acting styles of its stars.

==Plot==
Kevin Caffery, a skilled thief, meets Amber Belhaven, who is auctioning her father&#x27;s painting to settle a hotel bill. He discovers her hotel room and surprises her by returning the stolen painting. Kevin reveals his criminal activities to Amber, shocking her at first, but she accepts it in order to be with him. She eventually gives Kevin her father&#x27;s lucky ring.

Meanwhile, Max Fairbanks, a wealthy businessman facing bankruptcy, seeks legal advice from his lawyer, Walter Greenbaum. Max, known for his extravagant spending, disregards the seriousness of the situation. He keeps spending and suggests declaring bankruptcy immediately to protect his assets. Max tells his wife, Lutetia, that his company is going through a technical procedure to hide the truth.

Through a friend named Berger, Kevin learns about Max&#x27;s financial troubles. Berger informs him about Max&#x27;s beachfront mansion, which Kevin sees as an opportunity. They plan to rob Max&#x27;s house but end up getting caught. Max recognizes Amber&#x27;s stolen ring and forces Kevin to hand it over to the police. Kevin escapes and returns to the house later, seeking revenge. He robs Max&#x27;s valuables and one of his cars, telling Amber that the ring was stolen from him.

Walter informs Max that he is banned from his summer house due to breaching the bankruptcy terms. Max remains confident, believing the ring brings him luck. Kevin and Berger hire a hacker named Shelly Nix to track Max&#x27;s whereabouts by hacking into his email. During a flight, Max consults his psychic associate, Gloria, about the ring. Gloria draws a disturbing card but keeps it a secret.

Max insults a judge he believed he bribed to save his house, leading to an order for its public auction. As the crooks continue to rob Max&#x27;s properties, Max meets with Detective Alex Tardio and contacts his head of security, Earl Redburn.

Shelly informs Kevin that Max is heading to Washington, D.C. for a Senate hearing. Kevin learns that Max plans to bribe the senators and decides to replace the bribe money with an insulting note in Max&#x27;s name. Max and Earl discover Kevin&#x27;s presence in the apartment and a scuffle ensues. Kevin tries to steal the ring but ends up taking Max&#x27;s wedding ring instead. Kevin calls Max during the hearing; the ensuing argument further tarnishes Max&#x27;s reputation and leads his lawyer, Walter, to resign. Amber realizes the feud has gone too far and breaks up with Kevin, no longer caring about the ring.

Lutetia finds Amber wearing a stolen jacket at Jack&#x27;s bar and confronts her. They realize they share a common situation and devise a plan. Gloria, concerned about Max, admits the gravity of the card she drew and quits as his associate. She provides Max&#x27;s company records to Detective Tardio.

At the bankruptcy auction, Lutetia sends Max a masseuse. The crooks, led by Kevin, steal as much as they can and escape, creating chaos by faking a fire. Kevin steals the ring from Max, who gives chase. Their conflict ends on a sinking boat, when they realize Kevin took a fake ring. They are discovered by Detective Tardio, who arrests Max, and Kevin claims to have been saving Max. Kevin thanks Max, and Amber reveals herself as the masseuse who stole the ring. She advises Kevin to throw it away due to its bad luck. Kevin does so, and the two reconcile.

Pretending to be Max&#x27;s lawyer, Kevin manipulates the Senate hearing in Max&#x27;s favor, appearing victorious in the press conference. Kevin steals one of Max&#x27;s watches as they part ways.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was initially a potential United Artists project with Heath Ledger and James Gandolfini slated to star.

The film was shot in Beacon Hill, Boston.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
&quot;What&#x27;s the Worst That Could Happen?&quot; currently holds a 10% &quot;rotten&quot; rating on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes based on 99 reviews, with an average rating of 3.5/10, and the site&#x27;s consensus stating: &quot;Talented cast is squandered by an uninvolving script filled with unfunny gags.&quot; Another review aggregation website Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 from top mainstream critics, calculated a score of 37 based on 28 reviews.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film an unfavorable review, stating that there were &quot;too many characters, not enough plot, and a disconnect between the two stars&#x27; acting styles&quot;. Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; also gave the film a negative review and said, &quot;Maybe the worst thing that can happen is that every other movie at the multiplex will be sold out this weekend.&quot;

Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave a mixed review and said, &quot;Laborious in the unfolding of its plot, and under Sam Weisman&#x27;s brash direction the unbashed amorality of the material is crass rather than sly in tone&quot;.

However, some positive reviews came from Chris Kattenbach of the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; and Mike Clark of &quot;USA Today&quot;.

===Box office performance===
The film had $13,049,114 during its opening weekend, and ranked #5 at the box office. It was released in 2,675 theaters, and grossed $4,878 average. At the end of its theatrical run, &quot;What&#x27;s the Worst That Could Happen?&quot; has grossed $32,269,834 in the domestic market along with $6,194,297 in the foreign market for a worldwide total of $38,464,131. Therefore, the film was a box office flop, failing to recover its $60 million budget.

==Soundtrack==

A soundtrack containing hip hop and R&amp;B music was released on May 29, 2001 by Interscope Records. It peaked at 38 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and 6 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums.

Marc Shaiman, who wrote the score, told &quot;Playbill&quot; magazine that the &quot;worst job&quot; he ever had was &quot;scoring a hideous movie called &quot;What&#x27;s the Worst That Could Happen?&quot; I&#x27;m not kidding.&quot;

<doc id="561007" wikidata="Q1066765" url="?curid=561007" title="Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)">
<text>Venus and Adonis is a narrative poem by William Shakespeare published in 1593. It is probably Shakespeare&#x27;s first publication.

The poem tells the story of Venus, the goddess of Love; of her unrequited love; and of her attempted seduction of Adonis, an extremely handsome young man, who would rather go hunting. The poem is pastoral, and at times erotic, comic and tragic. It contains discourses on the nature of love, and observations of nature.

It is written in stanzas of six lines of iambic pentameter rhyming ABABCC; although this verse form was known before Shakespeare&#x27;s use, it is now commonly known as the &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; stanza, after this poem. This form was also used by Edmund Spenser and Thomas Lodge. The poem consists of 199 stanzas or 1,194 lines.

It was published originally as a quarto pamphlet and published with great care. It was probably printed using Shakespeare&#x27;s fair copy. The printer was Richard Field, who, like Shakespeare, was from Stratford. &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; appeared in print before any of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays were published, but not before some of his plays had been acted on stage. It has certain qualities in common with &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream, Romeo and Juliet&quot;, and &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;. It was written when the London theatres were closed for a time due to the plague.

The poem begins with a brief dedication to Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, in which the poet describes the poem as &quot;the first heir of my invention&quot;.

The poem is inspired by and based on stories found in the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, a narrative poem by the Latin poet, Ovid (43 BC – AD 17/18). Ovid&#x27;s much briefer version of the tale occurs in book ten of his &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. It differs greatly from Shakespeare&#x27;s version. Ovid&#x27;s Venus goes hunting with Adonis to please him, but otherwise is uninterested in the out-of-doors. She wears &quot;tucked up&quot; robes, worries about her complexion, and particularly hates dangerous wild animals. Shakespeare&#x27;s Venus is a bit like a wild animal herself: she apparently goes naked, and is not interested in hunting, but only in making love to Adonis, offering her body to him in graphically explicit terms. In the end, she insists that the boar&#x27;s killing of Adonis happened accidentally as the animal, impressed by the young hunter&#x27;s beauty, gored him while trying to kiss him. Venus&#x27;s behavior seems to reflect Shakespeare&#x27;s own feelings of empathy about animals: his poem devotes many stanzas to descriptions of a stallion&#x27;s feelings as he pursues a sexually attractive mare and to a hare&#x27;s feelings as hounds run it down, which is inconsistent with Venus&#x27;s request that he hunt only harmless animals like hares. Other stories in Ovid&#x27;s work are, to a lesser degree, considered sources: the tales of Salmacis and Hermaphroditus, Narcissus, and Pygmalion.

It was published about five years before Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s posthumously published &quot;Hero and Leander&quot;, which is also a narrative love poem based on a story from Ovid.

&quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; was extremely popular as soon as it was published, and it was reprinted fifteen times before 1640. It is unusual that so few of the original quartos have survived.

== Synopsis ==

Adonis is a young man renowned for his incredible beauty. However, he is not interested at all in love; he only wants to go hunting. Venus is the goddess of love. When she sees Adonis, she falls in love with him, and comes down to earth, where she encounters him setting out on a hunt. She desires him to get off his horse, and speak to her. Adonis doesn&#x27;t want to talk to any woman, not even a goddess. So she forces him, and then lies down beside him, gazes at him, and talks of love. She craves a kiss; he wants to leave and go hunting. He manages to get away, and he goes to get his horse.

At that moment, his horse becomes enamoured of another horse, who at first resists, but soon the two animals gallop off together, which keeps Adonis from going hunting. Venus approaches him, and continues to speak to him of love. He listens for a bit, then turns away scornfully. This pains her, and she faints. Afraid he might have killed her, Adonis kneels beside her, strokes and kisses her. Venus recovers and requests one last kiss. He reluctantly gives in.

Venus wants to see him again; Adonis tells her that he cannot tomorrow, because he is going to hunt the wild boar. Venus has a vision, and warns him that if he does so, he will be killed by a boar. She then flings herself on him, tackling him to the ground. He pries himself loose, and lectures her on the topic of lust versus love. He then leaves; she cries.

The next morning Venus roams the woods searching for Adonis. She hears dogs and hunters in the distance. Thinking of her vision that he will be killed by the boar, she is afraid, and hurries to catch up with the hunt. She comes across hunting dogs that are injured. Then she finds Adonis, killed by a wild boar. Venus is devastated. Because this loss occurred to the goddess of love, she decrees that love will henceforth be mixed with suspicion, fear, and sadness and that love will be &quot;fickle, false and full of fraud&quot;. Adonis&#x27;s body has grown cold and pale. His blood gives colour to the plants all around him. A flower grows from the soil beneath him. It is white and purple, like blood on Adonis&#x27;s flesh. Venus, bereft, leaves to confine herself to Paphos, on Cyprus, where she was worshipped.

== Adaptations ==
* In 1992, the then British poet laureate, Ted Hughes, published a book, &quot;Shakespeare and the Goddess of Complete Being&quot; (Faber and Faber in UK, Farrar Straus in US) based on a &quot;shamanic&quot; interpretation of &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; as a &quot;key&quot; to Shakespeare&#x27;s tragic dramas.
* In 1996 The Theatreworks Company, Dublin, staged an acclaimed adaptation by Artistic Director Michael Caven (now Barker-Caven).
* In 2004, the Royal Shakespeare Company staged &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; with marionettes (Gregory Doran, director).
* During the 2010–2011 season, the Boston Metro Opera staged &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;, a chamber opera in one act (duration approximately 40 mins). The libretto is Shakspeare&#x27;s poem (edited by Gretchen Snedeker (1983–2008), American French horn player and adjunct professor of music at Colgate University in Hamilton, New York). The music is by American composer Zachary Wadsworth (born 1983).
* The original poem is read by several British actors (among them David Burke, Eve Best, and Benjamin Soames) on a Naxos audiobook. The audiobook also includes &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot;.
* Richard Burton recorded a spoken word album of the poem for Caedmon Records.
* The title of the theme song for the Haunted Mansion attractions at Disneyland, Walt Disney World, and Tokyo Disneyland, &quot;Grim Grinning Ghosts&quot;, is taken from a line in &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;:

* A theatrical adaptation, &quot;William Shakespeare&#x27;s Venus &amp; Adonis&quot;, with an original score and songs by Christopher Reiner, was performed by Zombie Joe&#x27;s Underground Theatre Group in North Hollywood, California, in 2006.
* In 2020, &quot;Venus &amp; Adonis&quot; by Rodrigo Ruiz became the first song cycle ever known to be written by a Mexican composer, as well as the only song cycle known set entirely to Shakespeare&#x27;s texts. This work was recorded for Signum Records and released in the eponymous album on 27 September 2024.

<doc id="561018" wikidata="Q416814" url="?curid=561018" title="Cyanohydrin">
<text>In organic chemistry, a cyanohydrin or hydroxynitrile is a functional group found in organic compounds in which a cyano and a hydroxy group are attached to the same carbon atom. The general formula is , where R is H, alkyl, or aryl. Cyanohydrins are industrially important precursors to carboxylic acids and some amino acids. Cyanohydrins can be formed by the cyanohydrin reaction, which involves treating a ketone or an aldehyde with hydrogen cyanide (HCN) in the presence of excess amounts of sodium cyanide (NaCN) as a catalyst:

In this reaction, the nucleophilic ion attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon in the ketone, followed by protonation by HCN, thereby regenerating the cyanide anion. Cyanohydrins are also prepared by displacement of sulfite by cyanide salts:

Cyanohydrins are intermediates in the Strecker amino acid synthesis. In aqueous acid, they are hydrolyzed to the α-hydroxy acid.

==Acetone cyanohydrins==
Acetone cyanohydrin, (CH3)2C(OH)CN is the cyanohydrin of acetone. It is generated as an intermediate in the industrial production of methyl methacrylate. In the laboratory, this liquid serves as a source of HCN, which is inconveniently volatile. Thus, acetone cyanohydrin can be used for the preparation of other cyanohydrins, for the transformation of HCN to Michael acceptors, and for the formylation of arenes. Treatment of this cyanohydrin with lithium hydride affords anhydrous lithium cyanide:

==Preparative methods==
Cyanohydrins were first prepared by the addition of HCN and a catalyst (base or enzyme) to the corresponding carbonyl. On a laboratory scale the use of HCN (toxic) is largely not encouraged, for this reason other less dangerous cyanation reagents are sought out. In situ formation of HCN can be sourced using precursors such as acetone cyanohydrin. Alternatively, cyano-silyl derivatives such as TMS-CN allows for both the cyanation and protection in one step without the need for HCN. Similar procedures relying on ester, phosphate and carbonate formation have been reported.

==Other cyanohydrins==
Mandelonitrile, with the formula C6H5CH(OH)CN, occurs in small amounts in the pits of some fruits. Related cyanogenic glycosides are known, such as amygdalin.
Glycolonitrile, also called hydroxyacetonitrile or formaldehyde cyanohydrin, is the organic compound with the formula HOCH2CN. It is the simplest cyanohydrin, being derived from formaldehyde.

<text>The Muslim American Society (MAS) is a nonprofit organization founded in 1993 and headquartered in Washington, D.C. MAS describes itself as a grassroots Islamic movement. It has more than 50 chapters across the United States.

== History ==
Muslim American Society (MAS) was founded by a small group of American Muslims who wanted to have a Muslim organization in the United States that would allow them to &quot;organize and integrate Muslims to be a contributing part of American society, to see themselves as Muslim Americans.&quot; According to its website, the society is a &quot;charitable, religious, social, cultural, and educational organization&quot; aiming for a virtuous and just American society. Its mission is to &quot;move people and nurture lifelong, God-centered agents of change”.
MAS was incorporated in Illinois in 1993 and established its headquarters in Washington, DC, in 1998. Founding members of the organization were involved in the Muslim Brotherhood, an organization started in Egypt in 1928. The Muslim American Society acknowledges its early connection to the Muslim Brotherhood, including on its website, but says that it has moved &quot;beyond that point of conception&quot; and &quot;has no connection with the Brotherhood and disagrees with the international organization on many issues&quot;.

In 1999, the organization began publishing a bimonthly English-language magazine, &quot;The American Muslim&quot;. The following year, the MAS Youth Center opened in Brooklyn, and MAS helped start the Islamic American University, based out of Southfield, Michigan, and Kansas City, Missouri, as a distant-learning program for classical Islamic studies. In response to anti-Muslim hate following the September 11 attacks, MAS organized events such as Muslim American Heritage Day in Washington, D.C., where 150 Muslims gathered on October 5, 2002, to pray together on Freedom Plaza. The Muslim American Society Freedom Foundation, a public policy division led by Mahdi Bray as executive director, also offered seminars on how to positively change the perception of Islam among Americans.

In 2002, the Muslim American Society held its first joint conference with the Islamic Circle of North America (ICNA). The MAS–ICNA conference has since been held annually in Chicago.

In November 2014, MAS was designated a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates, with 84 other organizations including the Muslim Brotherhood and its regional and local affiliates, and other regional and international groups. MAS, CAIR and similar European groups were listed due to their alleged Muslim Brotherhood ties. The U.S. State Department subsequently released a statement saying that the department &quot;does not consider these organisations to be terrorist organisations&quot;. Muslim American Society stated that it had had &quot;no dealings with the United Arab Emirates&quot; and were &quot;perplexed by this news&quot;.

MAS started the “Know your Muslim neighbor&quot; program in January 2016 in response to growing anti-Islam sentiment. With the first event held in Metro Detroit, the program includes opportunities to learn about Muslim culture and traditions. Similar events were held in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, in 2018 and the Galveston Bay Area in 2019, following the Christchurch mosque shootings at a mosque in New Zealand and Easter bombing attacks on churches in Sri Lanka.

In 2019, the Middle East Media Research Institute published a video of children in a Philadelphia MAS center singing about the &quot;blood of martyrs&quot;.

In September 2019, the Muslim American Society of Minnesota co-organized a protest along with the Council on American–Islamic Relations and Anti-War Committee to “condemn human rights abuses and security crackdowns under India&#x27;s Hindu nationalist-led government&quot;. The protest was in response to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#x27;s appearance with U.S. president Donald Trump at a rally in Houston. Following the murder of George Floyd, members of MAS of Minnesota participated in the protests calling for justice for the African American man who was killed by police.

During the 2020 U.S. elections, Ismahan Abdullahi, executive director of the Muslim American Society, said that the organization made 185,000 calls and texts to Arab and Muslim communities in eight states including Michigan. Abdullahi is also executive director of MAS PACE National, a policy advocacy division of MAS.

Asad Zaman, executive director of the MAS of Minnesota, said in August 2020 that the organization&#x27;s food distribution program run at its three Minnesota mosques was up 500% due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In early April 2021, Zaman helped organize a COVID-19 vaccination campaign based out of 16 mosques in Minnesota which succeeded in vaccinating 7,000 people in the lead up to the month of Ramadan.

<text>Eduardo di Capua (May 12, 1865 – October 3, 1917) was an Italian composer, singer and songwriter.

== Biography ==
Di Capua was born in Naples in 1865, and he is best known for having composed the song &quot;&quot;.

In 1897, di Capua bought a collection of 23 melodies from an obscure composer, Alfredo Mazzucchi. He developed the music, and then invited the poet Giovanni Capurro to write lyrics for it. The resulting song has been recorded by many singers, both classical and popular, in both the original Neapolitan and in the English adaptation. His works on Neapolitan songs were published in the music magazine &quot;La Tavola Rotonda&quot;.

Di Capua also wrote &quot;Marie, Ah Marie&quot; (&quot;O Marie&quot; in English), another Neapolitan song. He died in 1917 in Naples.

<text>Erythrose is a tetrose saccharide with the chemical formula C4H8O4. It has one aldehyde group, and is thus part of the aldose family. The natural isomer is -erythrose; it is a diastereomer of -threose. 
Erythrose was first isolated in 1849 from rhubarb by the French pharmacist Louis Feux Joseph Garot (1798-1869), and was named as such because of its red hue in the presence of alkali metals (ἐρυθρός, &quot;red&quot;).

Erythrose 4-phosphate is an intermediate in the pentose phosphate pathway and the Calvin cycle.

Oxidative bacteria can be made to use erythrose as its sole energy source.

Although often inconsequential, erythrose in aqueous solution mainly exists as the hydrate owing to the following equilibrium:

<text>James Alexander Radomski (January 23, 1932 – June 21, 2022), known professionally as James Rado, was an American actor, playwright, director, and composer, best known as the co-author, along with Gerome Ragni, of the 1967 musical &quot;Hair&quot;. He and Ragni won for Best Musical Theater Album at the 11th Annual Grammy Awards and were nominated for the 1969 Tony Award for Best Musical.

==Early life==
Rado was born to Alexander and Blanche (Bukowski) Radomski on January 23, 1932, in Los Angeles and was raised in Irondequoit, New York, and Washington, D.C. In college, Rado majored in Speech and Drama and began writing songs. He co-authored two musical shows at the University of Maryland, &quot;Interlude&quot; and &quot;Interlude II&quot;. After graduation, followed by two years in the U.S. Navy, he returned to school in Washington, D.C., for graduate work at The Catholic University of America, where he co-authored a musical revue called &quot;Cross Your Fingers&quot;. He wrote the lyrics and music for all of his early songs.

He then moved to New York City, where he studied acting with Lee Strasberg and also wrote pop songs which he recorded with his own band, &quot;James Alexander and the Argyles&quot;. Rado&#x27;s first Broadway show was &quot;Marathon &#x27;33&quot; in 1963. In 1966, Rado played Richard Lionheart in the original Broadway production of &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; by James Goldman, starring Robert Preston and Rosemary Harris.

He met Gerome Ragni in 1964, when they acted together in the off-Broadway play &quot;Hang Down Your Head and Die&quot;. Later, both Rado and Ragni were cast in the roles of Tom and Tolan in the Chicago company of Mike Nichols&#x27; production of &quot;The Knack&quot;, by Ann Jellicoe.

==&quot;Hair&quot;==
Rado and Ragni became friends and began writing &quot;Hair&quot; together in late 1964. Rado explained, &quot;We were great friends. It was a passionate kind of relationship that we directed into creativity, into writing, into creating this piece. We put the drama between us on stage.&quot; He recalled, &quot;There was so much excitement in the streets and the parks and the hippie areas, and we thought if we could transmit this excitement to the stage it would be wonderful... We hung out with them and went to their Be-Ins [and] let our hair grow.&quot; &quot;Hair&quot; premiered off-Broadway in October 1967 and opened on Broadway in April 1968. It became a sensation, running for 1,750 performances and spawning numerous productions around the world and a 1979 film adaptation. Some of the songs from its score became Top 10 hits, and numerous albums of the songs have been released. The 2009 Broadway revival earned the Tony Award for Best Revival and also opened in London&#x27;s West End.

Although he did not play the part of Claude when the show premiered Off-Broadway, Rado originated the role of Claude on Broadway, performing opposite Ragni as Berger. He also played Claude in the later Los Angeles production. The main characters of Claude and Berger were autobiographical to a degree, with Rado&#x27;s Claude being the pensive romantic. In a 2008 interview with &quot;The Advocate&quot;, Rado publicly described himself for the first time as omnisexual and spoke openly of being Ragni&#x27;s lover.

==After &quot;Hair&quot;==
After the success of &quot;Hair&quot;, Rado and Ragni went their separate ways for a period of time in the early 1970s.

===&quot;Rainbow&quot;===
While Ragni and &quot;Hair&quot; composer Galt MacDermot collaborated on &quot;Dude&quot;, Rado wrote a musical entitled &quot;The Rainbow Rainbeam Radio Roadshow&quot;, or &quot;Rainbow&quot; for short, collaborating on the book with his brother Ted Rado and contributing his own music and lyrics. &quot;Rainbow&quot; opened Off-Broadway at the Orpheum Theater in December 1972. The musical is a sequel of sorts to &quot;Hair&quot; with a character called Man who was killed in the Vietnam War and who now lives in Rainbow land. Clive Barnes gave it a positive review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, writing &quot;&quot;[Rainbow]&quot; is joyous and life-assertive. It is the first musical to derive from &quot;Hair&quot; that really seems to have the confidence of a new creation about it, largely derived from James Rado&#x27;s sweet and fresh music and lyrics.&quot; Since then, &quot;Rainbow&quot; has been revised numerous times, in some developments becoming more explicitly a sequel to &quot;Hair&quot;, as when it became &quot;Rainbow: The Ghost of Vietnam&quot; in the late 1990s, and in others becoming more abstract as in one version, titled &quot;Billy Earth: The New Rainbow&quot; and later as &quot;American Soldier: The White Haunted House&quot;.

The latest version of the show, titled &quot;Supersoldier&quot;, was presented in a staged reading on October 14, 2013, by actor Sam Underwood&#x27;s (who plays evil twins Mark and Luke on &quot;The Following&quot;) Fundamental Theater Project in collaboration with the New York Theatre Barn at the Manhattan Movement and Arts Center. The reading was directed by Joe Barros and featured Tyson Jennette, Debbie Andrews, and Luis Villabon. Rado previously collaborated with the Fundamental Theater Project in 2010, playing the role of Hamlet&#x27;s Ghost in the company&#x27;s benefit reading of &quot;Hamlet&quot; in which Alec Baldwin, Kate Mulgrew, and Fundamental Theater Project Co-Artistic Director Sam Underwood also starred.

===&quot;Sun&quot;===
In 1974, Rado reunited with Ragni to co-write &quot;Sun (Audio Movie)&quot;, a show with music by Steve Margoshes based on a play by New York writer Joyce Greller with themes about pollution and the environment. The musical (then titled &quot;YMCA&quot;) was initially staged for backers in 1976, in a workshop directed by John Vaccaro, with appearances by Ruby Lynn Reyner and Annie-Joe Edwards. &quot;Sun&quot; was presented at the Howl! Arts Project in 2011. Another version of &quot;Sun&quot;, written with a score by &quot;Hair&quot; collaborator Galt MacDermot, was presented in concert form in 1998.

===Other shows===
Rado and Ragni would later write another musical together, again with Margoshes, entitled &quot;Jack Sound and His Dog Star Blowing His Final Trumpet on the Day of Doom&quot;. The show ran at La MaMa in the summer of 1978.

==Later years==
Following Ragni&#x27;s death in 1991, Rado was active in developing new productions of &quot;Hair&quot;, including the 11 city 1994 national tour which he directed, and the 2006 CanStage production in Toronto.

Since 2011, Rado was creative consultant for the futuristic rock musical &quot;Barcode&quot;, written and workshopped at a downtown Manhattan rock club in 2012 by the members of New York indie band Gladshot, and premiered in August 2013 at the New York International Fringe Festival. On December 3, 2011, Rado performed songs from &quot;Barcode&quot; at Occupy Wall Street&#x27;s Occupy Broadway.

Rado died on June 21, 2022, at a hospital in Manhattan from cardiorespiratory arrest at the age of 90.

<doc id="561065" wikidata="Q4838768" url="?curid=561065" title="Bachelor herd">
<text>A bachelor herd is a herd of (usually) juvenile male animals who are still sexually immature or &#x27;harem&#x27;-forming animals who have been thrown out of their parent groups but not yet formed a new family group. It may also refer to a group of males who are not currently territorial or mating with females.

Examples include seals, dolphins, lions, and many herbivores such as deer, horses, and elephants. Bachelor herds are thought to provide useful protection for social animals against more established herd competition or aggressive, dominant males. Males in bachelor herds are sometimes closely related to each other. Some animals, for example New Zealand fur seals, live in a bachelor herd all year except for the mating season, when there is a substantial increase in aggression and competition.

In many species, males and females move in separate groups, often coming together at mating time, or to fight for territory or mating partners. In many species it is common for males to leave or be driven from the group as they mature, and they may wander as lone animals or form a bachelor group for the time being. This arrangement may be long term and stable, or short term until they find a new group to join.

== Types ==
The social structure, aggression level, population size, and duration of presence of these herds across species varies greatly. Bachelor herds are most often found in mammals and are especially common in the grasslands.

===Impala===

Male impala form small bachelor herds during both the wet and dry seasons. These bachelor herds are generally smaller than herds of females, numbering around 4 members, compared to upwards of 10. Juvenile males begin to join bachelor herds at 8 months of age. In the Serengeti, immature or older males will usually form their own bachelor herds, while males of reproductive age are more often in mixed groups with females.

Being actively territorial in the Serengeti is physically demanding for male impala, so males occupy this role for about 3 months. Males will then join a bachelor herd, though this results in them occupying a social dominance status at the bottom of the linear rank hierarchy until their physical condition returns to pre-territorial levels. Bachelor herds may coexist with territorial males in the same area, but these individual males are always dominant above bachelor males.

Within the herds, bachelor males are less territorial toward each other than males in mixed herds. These males maintain, on average, a relatively large distance of approximately between them. However, bachelor males exhibit reciprocal grooming despite occasional aggressive interactions between bachelors.

===Fur seals===

Male fur seals, as a family, commonly live in bachelor herds during the non-breeding season. During the breeding season (April–September in the Northern Hemisphere, September–January in the Southern Hemisphere), the size of herds greatly diminishes. These bachelor herds are large in size, ranging from 15,000 to more than 20,000 seals living in one area, referred to as a rookery.

The grounds occupied by fur seal bachelor herds are generally far away from breeding grounds, anywhere from or more. Members of the group range from seal that are one year old, called yearlings, up through older seals. There appears to be no rigid social structure during the non-breeding season and there is little competition for food or mates. The male fur seals are also mostly non-aggressive.

Fur seal bachelor herds are frequently targets of the seal hunt due to large populations being concentrated in a relatively small area. There are few regulations in regard to adult male seal hunting due to limited effects on the future population.

===Cape mountain zebras===
Cape mountain zebra male foals often leave the breeding herd they were born in after the birth of siblings or around age 2, though the stallion of the breeding herd does not force them out. In fact, it has been observed that stallions often try to prevent foals from leaving the herd. These males then often go on to form their own bachelor herd or join an existing one. Males then stay in these bachelor herds until age 5, when they leave to become the stallion of their own breeding herd with one or more mares.

Within Cape mountain zebra bachelor herds, there is usually no social hierarchy. Dominance is given to the more senior members of the herd and when the oldest males leave to form a breeding herd, the next oldest bachelors take on the leadership role. There is minimal intragroup aggression and no observed fighting between members for a higher social position.

Bachelor herds often move with a breeding herd that is occupying a nearby area. At least one member of the bachelor herd in this case is usually the offspring of a mare in the breeding herd. Fillies also often temporarily join bachelor herds after leaving their maternal herd at the onset of their first estrus. The fillies then stay with the group until they join an existing breeding herd or make their own breeding herd with a bachelor male from the herd.

===Red deer===

Red deer males leave their mothers between 1 and 2 years of age. They then join bachelor herds, in which they spend most of the year. These herds are smaller (less than 50 members) and more unstable than the female herds and they follow a linear dominance hierarchy. This hierarchy is determined by both body size and the size of the stag&#x27;s antlers, with older stags having on average larger antlers. The older stags in the herd maintain their dominance from one year to the next.

Aggression within the herd is low until the stags shed their antlers, usually in early April. Intragroup clashes then increase as the females go into estrus. Males compete with members of their own bachelor herd for the attention of the females. This is called the “rutting season” and it lasts only a few weeks before males and females separate into their respective herds. The level of aggression within the bachelor herd then decreases substantially.

<doc id="561080" wikidata="Q3868596" url="?curid=561080" title="Music of Rwanda">
<text>The music of Rwanda encompasses Rwandan traditions of folk music as well as contemporary East African Afrobeat and Congolese ndombolo, and performers of a wide variety of Western genres including hip-hop, R&amp;B, gospel music and pop ballads.

== Traditional music==

Traditional music and dance are taught in &quot;amatorero&quot; dance groups, which are found across the country. The most famous of these is the Ballet National Urukerereza, which was created in the early 1970s to represent Rwanda in international events. Also famous were the Amasimbi n&#x27;amakombe and Irindiro dance troupes.

The ikinimba is perhaps the most revered musical tradition in Rwanda. It is a dance that tells the stories of Rwandan heroes and kings, accompanied by instruments like ngoma, ikembe, iningiri, umuduri and inanga. The inanga, a lyre-like string instrument, has been played many of Rwanda&#x27;s best-known performers, including Rujindiri, Sebatunzi, Rwishyura, Simparingoma, Sentoré, Kirusu, Sophie and Viateur Kabarira, and Simon Bikindi.

Jean-Paul Samputu, along with his group Ingeli, won two Kora awards (African Grammy awards) for &quot;Most Inspiring Artist&quot; and &quot;Best Traditional Artist&quot; in 2003 for their performance of neo-traditional Rwandan music. The group tours the world spreading the Christian message of peace and reconciliation, and helps raise money for the many orphans of Rwanda. In 2007 Samputu brought twelve of these orphans, known as Mizero Children of Rwanda, to tour the U.S. and Canada. Cyprien Kagorora was nominated for a 2005 Kora Award in the category of &quot;Best Traditional Artist&quot;. He is among the most recognizable male vocalists in Rwanda.

== Contemporary artists ==
In the post-colonial period, Rwanda produced popular local bands like Imena, Nyampinga, Les 8 Anges, Les Fellows, Impala, Abamarungu, Los Compagnons de la Chanson, Bisa, Ingenzi, and Isibo y&#x27;Ishakwe. They took influences from across Africa, especially the Congo, as well as Caribbean Zouk and Reggae.

Socio-military unrest and violence led many Rwandans to move overseas in the late 20th century, bringing their country&#x27;s music to cities like Brussels and Paris. For many years, Rwandan-Belgian Cécile Kayirebwa was arguably the most internationally famous Rwandan musician. She is still played regularly on Rwandan radio stations. The late 1990s saw the arrival of Rwandan-Canadian Corneille and Jean-Paul Samputu.

The Rwandan genocide temporarily disrupted music production within Rwanda. In recent years music has gradually returned to the country, led by Rwandan youth. A crop of new stars has emerged, including such names as Kamichi, Aimé Murefu, Mani Martin, Tom Close, Urban Boyz, Miss Jojo, King James, Knowless, Dream Boys, Kitoko, Riderman, and Miss Shanel.

==Local music industry==
The music industry in Rwanda is gradually growing and becoming more professionalized. An increasing number of companies are investing in the development of new talent, including the production of major music festivals like Kigali Up! and Primus Guma Guma Super Star, and the music competition television show .artists like Meddy, are now taking Rwandan music to the next level

<doc id="561084" wikidata="Q17021968" url="?curid=561084" title="Take Hart">
<text>Take Hart is a British children&#x27;s television programme about art presented by Tony Hart. It took over from &quot;Vision On&quot;, and ran from 1977 until 1983.

==Format==
The programme featured Hart and the animated Plasticine character Morph, and other characters created by David Sproxton like &#x27;Smoulder the Moulder&#x27;, which was a lump of mould which would create props by &#x27;spraying&#x27; them out of a spray can. The only other human to appear on a regular basis was Mr. Bennett, the caretaker, played by Colin Bennett. The programme won a BAFTA award for Hart in 1984.

As well as demonstrating small-scale projects (the type that viewers might be able to do), Hart also created large-scale artworks on the TV studio floor and even used beaches and other open spaces as &#x27;canvases&#x27; (to be viewed from a camera-crane). This idea was later adopted by &quot;Art Attack&quot;, which began in 1990.

A regular feature of the programme was &#x27;The Gallery&#x27;, which displayed artworks sent in by young viewers. The easy-listening vibraphone music accompanying this feature – &quot;Left Bank Two&quot;, composed by Wayne Hill – has passed into British TV musical lore. In later series, &quot;Left Bank Two&quot; alternated with John Williams&#x27; recording of &quot;Cavatina&quot;, and in the final three series, the theme music was replaced by the more reggae-like &quot;Passion Punch&quot;, composed by Stanley Myers, and The Gallery music was replaced by &quot;Marguerite&quot;, by Bob Morgan, which is also well-remembered by many viewers.

==Demise==
By the end of the eighth series in December 1983, Hart felt that the format of the programme, which essentially continued with much of the format of its predecessor &quot;Vision On&quot;, had become somewhat outdated and routine. Despite the award of a BAFTA in early 1984, viewing figures for &quot;Take Hart&quot; by 1983 had gradually fallen since the series&#x27; heyday in the late 1970s. In an attempt to update the image of the series, &quot;Take Hart &quot; was dropped in December 1983, and replaced by the relatively more popular series &quot;Hartbeat&quot;.

Some 2 inch Quadruplex videotape master copies of &quot;Take Hart&quot; episodes were irretrievably junked by Adam Lee of the BBC archives in 1993 on the assumption that they were &#x27;no use&#x27; and that examples of some other episodes were sufficient. A few months later, access to the material was requested by the head of Children&#x27;s BBC&#x27;s light entertainment department for a documentary on Tony Hart.

<doc id="561085" wikidata="Q5883214" url="?curid=561085" title="Holman Christian Standard Bible">
<text>The Holman Christian Standard Bible (HCSB) is a modern English Bible translation from Holman Bible Publishers. The New Testament was published in 1999, followed by the full Bible in March 2004.

== Beginnings ==
The roots of the HCSB can be traced to 1984, when Arthur Farstad, general editor of the New King James Version of the Bible, began a new translation project. In 1998, Farstad and LifeWay Christian Resources (the publishing arm of the Southern Baptist Convention) came to an agreement that would allow LifeWay to fund and publish the completed work. Farstad died soon after, and leadership of the editorial team was turned over to Dr. Edwin Blum, who had been an integral part of the team. The death of Farstad resulted in a change to the Koine Greek source text underlying the HCSB, although Farstad had envisioned basing the new translation on the same texts used for the King James Version and New King James Version. He followed the Greek Majority Text which he and Zane C. Hodges had authored. After Farstad&#x27;s death, the editorial team replaced this text with the consensus Greek New Testament established by twentieth-century scholars.

Holman Bible Publishers assembled an international, interdenominational team of 100 scholars and proofreaders, all of whom were committed to biblical inerrancy.

==Formats==
The HCSB is available in electronic form for WORDsearch and Bible Explorer software. An &quot;HCSB Study Bible&quot; became available in October 2010. The HCSB is available online. It has a version specifically for the Microsoft Xbox 360 called Bible Navigator X.

== Updates ==
The 2nd edition HCSB appeared in 2010. The most significant change was the expanded use of the covenant name of God, known as the tetragrammaton, rendered as &quot;Yahweh,&quot; rather than the traditional English &quot;.&quot; In the first edition Yahweh was found in 78 places; the update increased that to 495 instances (the tetragrammaton appears in over 6,800 places in the Old Testament).

In June 2016 B&amp;H Publishing announced a revision of the translation called the Christian Standard Bible (CSB).

<doc id="561089" wikidata="Q10334888" url="?curid=561089" title="Music of Burundi">
<text>Burundi is a Central African nation that is closely linked with Rwanda, geographically, historically and culturally. The drum such as the &quot;karyenda&quot; is one of central importance. Internationally, the country has produced the music group Royal Drummers of Burundi.

Burundian-Belgian musicians like Éric Baranyanka from the Burundese royal family, Ciza Muhirwa and, especially, Khadja Nin, have more recently gained prominence. Since the music is from the mind and soul, it mainly expresses what the people in Burundi feel and what they think when they beat the drums.

One feature of Burundian men&#x27;s folk songs is the presence of an &quot;inanga&quot;, a type of stringed zither.

Burundian women greet each other in an interlocking rhythmic vocal form called akazehe.

Other instruments include:
* Ingoma drums, made from tree trunks
* The umwironge, a type of flute usually made from the stem of an intomvu plant
* The igihuha, a horn made from antelope horn
* The ikinyege, a rattle made from a gourd of the igicuma plant
* The iyebe, a rattle with threaded, dried, hollowed-out inyege fruit pods
* The inzogera, a closed bell classified as an idiophone, similar to the amayugi
* The umudende, a narrow cylindrical bell formed by bending a thin iron sheet into a narrow cylinder, with a hook of metal attached at top
* The ikembe, technically a lamellaphone consisting of a series of iron lamellae fixed to a rectangular wooden soundbox
* The indingiti, a stringed instrument classified as a fiddle
* The idono, a musical bow consisting of a string (umurya) supported by a flexible wooden string bearer or bow (umuheto)

== Burundi beat ==
The so-called &quot;diverse Burundi beat&quot;, filled with distinctive drumming created by Burundi&#x27;s tribal musicians and recorded by French anthropologists, was used to create unique music by English pop bands Adam and the Ants and Bow Wow Wow.

<text>A po&#x27; boy (also po-boy, po boy derived from the non-rhotic southern accents often heard in the region, or poor boy) is a sandwich originally from Louisiana. It traditionally consists of meat, which is usually roast beef, ham, or fried seafood such as shrimp, crawfish, fish, oysters, or crab. The meat is served in New Orleans French bread, known for its crisp crust and fluffy center.

==Preparation==
A wide selection of meat fills the &quot;po&#x27; boy bread,&quot; including roast beef, ham, fried shrimp, fried crawfish, fried catfish, Louisiana hot sausage, fried chicken, alligator, duck, boudin, and rabbit listed among possible ingredients.

&quot;Po&#x27; boy bread&quot; is a local style of French bread traditionally made with less flour and more water than a traditional baguette, yielding a wetter dough that produces a lighter and fluffier bread that is less chewy. The recipe was developed in the 1700s in the Gulf South because the humid climate was not conducive to growing wheat, requiring wheat flour to be imported and thus less available.

A &quot;dressed&quot; po&#x27; boy has shredded lettuce, sliced tomato, sliced pickles, and mayonnaise. Fried seafood po&#x27; boys can be dressed with melted butter and sliced pickle rounds. A Louisiana-style hot sauce is optional. Non-seafood po&#x27; boys will also often have Creole mustard.

Aside from meat and seafood, cheese has also been a recognized ingredient since the Great Depression, the sandwich&#x27;s inception occurring at the beginning of that period (year 1929).

The fried oyster po&#x27;boys are also referred to by the distinct name &quot;oyster loaf&quot;, and apparently have a different and older history.

In a New Orleans &quot;sloppy roast beef&quot; po&#x27; boy, thick cuts are served with gravy, or for the &quot;CrockPot tender&quot; type the beef is stewed down until melded with its sauce, while in a third style, thinner slices are dipped in beef &quot;jus&quot;. Garlic is an optional seasoning. Roast beef po&#x27; boys are commonly offered with &quot;debris&quot; (pronounced ), which is bits of meat that fall during cooking and are rendered into a near-gravy.

==Etymology==
In the late 19th century, fried oyster sandwiches on French loaves were known in New Orleans as &quot;oyster loaves&quot;, a term still in use. A sandwich containing both fried shrimp and fried oysters is often called a &quot;peacemaker&quot; or .

A popular local theory claims that the term &quot;poor boy&quot; (later &quot;po&#x27; boy&quot;, etc.), specifically referring to a type of sandwich, was coined in a New Orleans restaurant owned by Benjamin (&quot;Benny&quot;) and Clovis Martin, former streetcar conductors originally from Raceland, Louisiana. 

The Martins established their eatery in 1921. In 1929 the bakery of John Gendusa first baked the bread used for this sandwich. In 1929, during a four-month strike against the streetcar company, the Martin brothers served their former colleagues free sandwiches.

The Martins were interviewed on record regarding the origins of the sandwich. Benny Martin reminisced that they jokingly referred to an incoming diner as &quot;another poor boy&quot; if he turned out to be one of the strikers. The Martin brothers were asked the question of whether the name was inspired by some French or French patois word such as , but they denied that was the case.

One New Orleans historian finds the Martin claim suspicious for several reasons, starting with the fact that it was not described by the local press until 40 years after the strike, and that prior to 1969 the story from the Martin brothers themselves was that they had created the po&#x27; boy for farmers, dock workers and other &quot;poor boys&quot; who frequented their original location near the French Market. The Martin brothers wrote a letter, reprinted in local newspapers in 1929, promising to feed the streetcar workers, but it referenced &quot;our meal&quot; and made no mention of sandwiches.

==New Orleans==

New Orleans is known for its grand restaurants (see Louisiana Creole cuisine), but more humble fare like the po&#x27; boy is very popular. Po&#x27; boys may be made at home, sold pre-packaged in convenience stores, available at deli counters and most neighborhood restaurants. One of the most basic New Orleans restaurants is a po&#x27; boy shop, and these shops often offer seafood platters, red beans and rice, jambalaya, and other basic Creole dishes.

The two primary sources of po&#x27;boy bread are the Leidenheimer Baking Company and Alois J. Binder. There is fierce competition between po&#x27; boy shops, and resident opinions of the best po&#x27; boy shop varies widely.

Each year there is a festival in New Orleans dedicated to the po&#x27; boy, the Oak Street Po&#x27;Boy Festival. It is a one-day festival that features live music, arts, and food vendors with multiple types of po&#x27; boys. It is held in mid-November along a commercial strip of Oak Street in the city&#x27;s Carrollton neighborhood. The festival gives &quot;best-of&quot; awards, which gives the chefs an incentive to invent some of the most creative po&#x27; boys.
==Variations==
Authentic versions of Louisiana-style po&#x27; boys can be found along the Gulf Coast, from Houston through the Florida Panhandle. The term &quot;po&#x27; boy&quot; has spread further and can be found in the South Atlantic States and in California, where it may instead refer to local variations on the submarine sandwich.

Houston has its own variety of the po&#x27; boy, with chowchow added to ham, salami and provolone cheese, created in the 1960s and popularized by Syrian and Lebanese restaurateurs. Stephen Paulsen of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; said the sandwich was &quot;in the city’s food DNA, the Shipley Do-Nuts of sandwiches.&quot; It was first created by Lebanese American Jalal Antone, owner of Antone&#x27;s Import Company in the Fourth Ward, in 1962 after his brother-in-law warned him that area residents at the time would not be accustomed to Levantine cuisine and the business should focus on something more familiar. 

John Lomax of &quot;Houstonia&quot; described the 1970s and 1980s as the height of their popularity and that the growth of chain sandwich shops that operated across the United States, the introduction of banh mi, and the poor quality of similar sandwiches in gas stations resulted in a decrease in popularity for the variety.

Vietnamese immigration to the Gulf South, including New Orleans, since the 1970s has led to some crossover between po&#x27; boys and bánh mì.

<text>Like a Prayer is the fourth studio album by American singer-songwriter Madonna, released on March 21, 1989, by Sire Records. It saw the singer reunited with Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray, with whom she had collaborated on her previous studio album &quot;True Blue&quot; (1986), and the soundtrack to the 1987 film &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot;; artist Prince also collaborated on the record, co-writing and co-producing one of the tracks alongside Madonna. Her most introspective release at the time, &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; is a pop record with elements of rock and dance-pop. Its lyrics deal with personal themes she had been too afraid to approach on previous albums: her Catholic upbringing, her troubled marriage to actor Sean Penn, the death of her mother, and her relationship with her father.

Upon its release, &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; received universal acclaim from music critics, who praised its introspective tone, cohesiveness, and Madonna&#x27;s increased artistic merit. It was also an international success, reaching the top of the charts in 20 countries, and was certified quadruple platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Worldwide, it has sold over 15 million copies. Six singles were released from the album: the title track became Madonna&#x27;s seventh number one hit on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while &quot;Express Yourself&quot; and &quot;Cherish&quot; both peaked at number two, and &quot;Keep It Together&quot; became a top-ten hit.

The album was promoted on Madonna&#x27;s third concert tour, 1990&#x27;s Blond Ambition World Tour, which visited cities in Asia, North America, and Europe. In retrospective reviews, &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; has been noted as a turning point in Madonna&#x27;s career; she began to be seen as a serious artist rather than a mere pop star. Critics and authors also pointed out influence from the album on the work of modern female singers. Often referred to as one of the greatest albums of all time, &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; has been included in several musical reference books and best-of lists, including &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

== Background ==

1988 was a quiet year on the recording front for Madonna. Following the lack of critical and commercial success of her 1987 film &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot;, she acted in the Broadway production &quot;Speed-the-Plow&quot;. However, unfavorable reviews once again caused her discomfort. Her marriage to actor Sean Penn ended and the couple filed for divorce in January 1989. Madonna had also turned 30, the same age at which her mother had died, and thus experienced more emotional turmoil. &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t say [turning 30] was traumatic [...] [but] [it] was the age my mother was [when she died]. I just flipped because I kept thinking, &#x27;I&#x27;m now outliving my mother&#x27;&quot;, she recalled.

As the new decade was approaching, the &quot;greed is good&quot; mentality of the mid-1980s was starting to fade away because of the Black Monday. The rise of rap acts like Public Enemy and Run-DMC, and Grunge precursors like Faith No More and Jane&#x27;s Addiction, created a change in the public&#x27;s mood; Madonna came to the conclusion that she had to move away from teen appeal and the &quot;commercial gloss&quot; of her previous works if she wanted to reach more mature audiences and create longevity in the music industry. She wanted her new sound to be &quot;instinctive rather than calculating&quot;, and knew her next record had to be &quot;vibrant, challenging, and different&quot;.

Realizing that it was time to show a &quot;darker, more spiritual side&quot; of her, Madonna took a &quot;more sophisticated approach&quot;; she revealed that, &quot;in the past I wrote a lot of songs that [revealed my inner self], but I felt they were too honest or too frightening or too scary and I decided not to record them&quot;. Thoughtfully, she sifted through her personal journals and diaries, and began considering her options. She had certain matters on her mind, including her troubled relationship with Penn, her family, the loss of her mother, and even her belief in God; &quot;What was it I wanted to say? I wanted [the album] to speak to things on my mind&quot;, she explained.

== Development ==

According to author Mark Bego, a lot of the &quot;somberness&quot; on &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; stemmed from what Madonna was going through while she was in New York working on &quot;Speed-the-Plow&quot;. The role, which she described as &quot;incredibly draining and spiritually depressing&quot;, as well as the play&#x27;s introspective themes, caused her feelings of &quot;frustration and despair&quot;. She was upset and dealing with a lot of sadness that she hadn&#x27;t felt in a long time. She went on to say that, whereas her previous albums came from the &quot;little girl&quot; in her, interested only in &quot;being entertaining and charming and frivolous&quot;, &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; is the &quot;adult side [of me], which is concerned with being brutally honest&quot;. The record drew its title from Catholicism&#x27;s influence on Madonna&#x27;s early life, as well as her struggles with religion; &quot;the theme [of Catholicism] runs rampant [on the album] [...] It&#x27;s me struggling with the mystery and magic that surrounds it. My own Catholicism is in constant upheaval&quot;, she said.

For the album, Madonna chose to work with Stephen Bray and Patrick Leonard, with whom she had collaborated on her previous studio album &quot;True Blue&quot; (1986), and the &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; soundtrack (1987). Both Bray and Leonard wanted to bring their unique style to the project, and developed different musical ideas to present to Madonna; Bray&#x27;s approach was more &quot;kinetic&quot; and dance pop-oriented, while Leonard&#x27;s focused more on melodies. Madonna was aware of the contrast between the producers&#x27; work, but never did anything to deter them, as she felt tension was &quot;good for creativity and business&quot;. It was Leonard who convinced Madonna to create songs that were &quot;intensely emotional experiences&quot;. His way of work was &quot;completely intellectual&quot;, whereas Madonna relied more on instinct. He would create the music while she worked on the lyrics; &quot;[Pat] puts together these really strange chord progressions and these really great time signatures [...] I&#x27;d start singing words to it and making them fit&quot;, the singer explained. All the songs had one common theme: Madonna&#x27;s Catholicism, her family and relationships.

Title track &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; was the first song Madonna and Leonard worked on; once she had conceptualized the way she would interpose her ideas with Leonard&#x27;s music, she wrote the lyrics in about three hours. &quot;Promise to Try&quot; followed the same dynamic: Madonna sang as Leonard played piano. In just two weeks, they had created &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, &quot;Till Death Do Us Part&quot;, &quot;Promise to Try&quot;, &quot;Cherish&quot;, &quot;Dear Jessie&quot;, and &quot;Spanish Eyes&quot;. Leonard recalled that they only wrote songs that would be included on the final track list; &quot;[we] wrote a song a day, and we didn&#x27;t change them [...] that&#x27;s it. A few hours and they were done&quot;. Despite this mentality, they created other songs: &quot;Supernatural&quot; ―issued as B-side on the &quot;Cherish&quot; single―, &quot;Just a Dream&quot; ―given to Madonna&#x27;s back-up singer Donna De Lory for her debut album―, and &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot;;
 in 2019, Leonard uploaded some of the demos he worked on with Madonna to YouTube.

Madonna&#x27;s sessions with Bray were similar; he would send her demos and they would get together and work on the ones she&#x27;d approve. Bray would come up with a verse or chorus and, alongside Madonna, created the bridge. As with Leonard, the singer was in charge of the lyrics and intervened in the final touches; &quot;I&#x27;ve always done the ribcage and the skeleton of the songs, she&#x27;s there for the last things like the eyebrows and the haircut&quot;, noted Bray. The songs they came up with were &quot;Express Yourself&quot;, &quot;Keep It Together&quot;, &quot;First is a Kiss&quot;, and &quot;Love Attack&quot;; these last two, however, were scrapped from the track list as they didn&#x27;t align with the album&#x27;s &quot;confessional&quot; mood.

Prince also worked on the album. He and Madonna met at the 1985 American Music Awards and quickly became friends. They talked about collaborating multiple times, and even considered writing a musical together. Madonna flew to Prince&#x27;s Paisley Park studios where they created several songs, but none were ever completed. Sessions were messy, as the two artists had different personalities: Madonna was more organized while Prince liked things &quot;mercurial and improvisational&quot;. Madonna then went back to Los Angeles to start rehearsals for &quot;Speed-the-Plow&quot;; some time later, Prince went to New York see a performance of the play and gave the singer a rough tape with the songs they had recorded over the phone. &quot;Love Song&quot; was one of the songs on the tape, as well as the only one Madonna liked. Despite wanting to get together to complete the track, Madonna and Prince ended up working long distance, sending each other tapes back and forth; &quot;it was great. It was a completely different way to work&quot;, recalled Madonna. Prince also played guitar on &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, &quot;Keep It Together&quot;, and &quot;Act of Contrition&quot;, though he remained uncredited.

== Recording ==

Recording took place at Los Angeles&#x27; Johnny Yuma, Saturn Sound and Ocean Way Recording studios, and Prince&#x27;s Paisley Park, from September 1988 to January 1989. As it was an album with &quot;so bleak an outlook&quot;, sessions were generally very focused; they took place mainly at Johnny Yuma, the studio Madonna and Leonard built with the incomes from &quot;True Blue&quot;. According to author Lucy O&#x27;Brien, Madonna was a &quot;new woman in the studio&quot;; she had clear knowledge not only of the instrumentation, but knew how to articulate and achieve the sounds she heard in her head. Leonard recalled that Madonna usually works fast, but due to its emotional tone, it took her &quot;maybe three or four times as long to make [&quot;Like a Prayer&quot;] because she kept breaking down&quot;. As it was the second time she produced an album, Madonna felt she had to &quot;prove to everyone [it] wasn&#x27;t a fluke&quot;, and would get into fights with Leonard. The producer recalled that during one of their arguments, the singer held up the &quot;True Blue&quot; cover and shouted at him, &#x27;Whose picture is that?&#x27;; the fights stopped from there on.

Unlike her previous albums, &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; was recorded in the studio with live musicians, rather than overdubbing the vocals on top of the finished music. It also used a &quot;greater proportion&quot; of live first takes. Madonna recalled that it was the first time that she was in the same room as the musicians, which she considered a &quot;more integral&quot; approach to the music, and resulted in &quot;more emotional [and] spontaneous&quot; vocals. Leonard, who had experience recording with live musicians, explained the recording process: He and Madonna would write the songs, record the demos, and replace the drum machines and percussions with real musicians; they then would add background singers and guitar players. He described the process as &quot;personal, not the product of big songwriting teams&quot;.
Musicians working on &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; included Bruce Gaitsch, Jonathan Moffett, Jeff Porcaro, Jain Winding, and Guy Pratt; the latter had met Leonard through his work with Bryan Ferry. The title track originally featured bongos and Latin percussion, but were quickly discarded; Madonna then decided to add a church organ and a choir. Andraé Crouch and his gospel choir, who had worked with artists like Stevie Wonder, Chaka Khan, and Quincy Jones, were hired. They accepted the offer after analyzing the lyrics; &quot;we&#x27;re very particular in choosing what we work with, and we liked what we heard&quot;, recalled Crouch. When recording, Madonna encouraged all present in the studio to &quot;surrender themselves to passionate abandon&quot;. Leonard was asked to work on &quot;Love Song&quot; but, being a Prince fan, found himself shaken and &quot;overawed&quot;; nonetheless, he was happy to work on &quot;Keep It Together&quot;. &quot;Cherish&quot; reunited Madonna with backup singers Donna De Lory and Niki Haris, with whom she worked on 1987&#x27;s Who&#x27;s That Girl World Tour. De Lory recalled the sessions: &quot;[We] worked on it until we were really tight [...] [Madonna] knew exactly what she wanted and how to break it down”.

Initially planned to be recorded with an orchestra, &quot;Promise to Try&quot; was done with a piano and a quartet, and Madonna&#x27;s &quot;naked&quot; voice. The orchestra was used for &quot;Oh Father&quot;; the singer and Leonard worked on the track in &quot;this really dingy awful little studio&quot; in New York&#x27;s Garment District. First, they recorded Madonna&#x27;s vocals; then the orchestra, and ended things up with a doubletracking.

== Composition ==
&quot;Like a Prayer&quot; is an album that bends &quot;classic psychedelic rock with then-current synth-pop sounds&quot;. It has been noted a pop record with rock and dance elements, with influence from acts from the 1960s and 70s such as the Beatles, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, and Sly and the Family Stone. As Madonna&#x27;s most personal and introspective album up to the time, its lyrics talk, in her own words, about &quot;the influence of Catholicism on my life, and the passion it provokes in me [...] They&#x27;re about an assimilation of experiences I had in my life and in relationships. They&#x27;re about my mother, my father, and bonds with my family, about the pain of dying, of growing up and letting go&quot;.

Opener &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; is a song about a young woman &quot;so in love with God that it is almost as though he were the male figure in her life&quot;. It is a pop rock song with elements of gospel music; a choir provides background vocals that heighten the song&#x27;s spiritual nature, and a rock guitar keeps the music &quot;dark and mysterious&quot;. The second track, &quot;Express Yourself&quot;, is one of the album&#x27;s two tributes to Sly and the Family Stone. It talks about rejecting material pleasures and only accepting the best for oneself; throughout the song, subtexts are employed. &quot;Love Song&quot; is a duet with Prince that begins with Madonna asking in French, &quot;I&#x27;m ready, are you ready?&quot;. The track has been compared to the work of Eddie Kendricks and the Temptations; Prince provides &quot;Jimmy Nolen funk guitar[s] and falsetto vocals&quot;, singing both in his upper and lower registers. Originally titled &quot;State of Matrimony&quot;, fourth track &quot;Till Death Do Us Part&quot; is an &quot;autobiographical account of [Madonna&#x27;s] ill-fated marriage to Penn&quot;. It is a fast tempo track that expresses the conflict of being in love with someone who doesn&#x27;t love themselves, and ends with the sound of wah-wah guitars and broken glass.

&quot;Promise to Try&quot; is a moody ballad that talks about the death of Madonna&#x27;s mother. The piano arrangement in the song is reminiscent of the work of Elton John, and has a cello solo towards the Bridge. In one part of the song, Madonna specifically asks: &quot;Does she hear my voice in the night when I call?&quot; Later, an adult seems to admonish a child with the lyrics, &quot;Little girl, don&#x27;t you forget her face/Don&#x27;t let memory play games with your mind/She&#x27;s a faded smile frozen in time&quot;. The sixth track is &quot;Cherish&quot;. Built around the themes of love and relationship, with William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; being one of the major inspirations, the song includes a line from &quot;Cherish&quot; (1966) by the Association. The lyrics illustrate it as a simple love song, where Madonna talks about devotion and having her lover by her side, whom she would never leave. Following &quot;Cherish&quot; is &quot;Dear Jessie&quot;; according to Rikky Rooksby, the song sounds more like a children&#x27;s lullaby than a pop song. The lyrics encourage the little girl Jessie to use her imagination; it summons up a psychedelic landscape, where pink elephants roam with dancing moons and mermaids. It references fairy-tale characters and creates an image of children playing with each other.

&quot;Oh Father&quot; is a baroque pop ballad that talks about Madonna&#x27;s troubled relationship with her father Tony during her childhood. She described it as the &quot;second half&quot; of &quot;True Blue&quot;″s &quot;Live to Tell&quot;, and is her tribute to Simon &amp; Garfunkel. She uses a contrast of timbre, her higher smoother voice with a lower one. in the vocal bridge, Madonna talks about the realization that her father never meant to hurt her, and why she runs away. Described as Madonna&#x27;s take on Sister Sledge&#x27;s &quot;We Are Family&quot; (1979), &quot;Keep It Together&quot; is the other tribute to Sly and the Family Stone; a funk-inspired number with doubletracked vocals on the refrain, she sings about the importance of family, and mentions that &quot;blood is thicker than any circumstance&quot;. &quot;Spanish Eyes&quot; is a slow, sombre track that features instrumentation from castanets, and revisits the Spanish vibe of 1987&#x27;s &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;. It has been described a &quot;cross between Ben E. King&#x27;s &#x27;Spanish Harlem&#x27; and something by Billy Joel&quot;. Its lyrics are ambiguous and have been subject to various interpretations: AIDS, a Hispanic mother&#x27;s lament over the death of her son due to gang violence, or someone going off to fight in a war. Closer &quot;Act of Contrition&quot; is an experimental song with psychedelic tones; it begins with a &quot;whispered invocation&quot; and features distorted guitar and backward tracking of a gospel choir. It has Madonna reciting the Catholic prayer of the same name, before the vocals deteriorate into a monologue in which she grows obstreperous over being denied a restaurant reservation.

== Artwork and release ==

For &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, Madonna adopted a new image; she dyed her blonde hair dark, wore well-worn jeans, multiple rings on her fingers, garnet-encrusted crucifixes, a string of colored beads and glass gemstones around her neck. This new look was described as &quot;very sixties&quot; and a &quot;cross between [a] gypsy and [a] hippie&quot; by Mark Bego and Adam Sexton, respectively. It was Madonna&#x27;s first studio album that didn&#x27;t feature her face on the front cover. Shot by Herb Ritts, it depicts a close-up of the singer&#x27;s crotch and hands; the first two buttons of her fly are undone and her fingers, adorned with rings and beads, hold down the top of her jeans. According to O&#x27;Brien, the cover was inspired by Madonna&#x27;s mother, who used to cover up her Sacred Heart statue with zip-up jeans each time a woman came to visit. Critics have compared the artwork to that of &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; (1971) by the Rolling Stones, which shows a close-up of Mick Jagger&#x27;s crotch, and &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; (1984) by Bruce Springsteen. Writing for the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, Barry Walters noted that the artwork sees Madonna &quot;virtually exposing herself&quot;, while for &quot;Attitude&quot;″s Matthew Burton, &quot;for a woman whose album and single artwork had been so inextricably linked with her face, [&quot;Like a Prayer&quot;] announced a new kind of Madonna&quot;. On CD editions, the album&#x27;s back cover shows a black and white image of Madonna dancing with a flowing purple chiffon top, while the photograph used on the inner sleeve shows a dark-haired Madonna in a praying pose. The vinyl editions used the &quot;praying&quot; picture as the back cover, and the &quot;dancing&quot; one on the inner sleeve.

On January 24, 1989, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; would be released on February 28; &quot;The Albany Herald&quot;, however, reported the release date would be March 15. &quot;Billboard&quot; then informed on February 11 that the album would be sent to radios on March 17, and released four days later. Bray told &quot;The Lewiston Journal&quot; that the public would be &quot;very surprised&quot; at the album&#x27;s personal tone; &quot;anyone expecting but get up and boogie will be most disappointed&quot;. There were reports that label executives were &quot;biting their nails&quot; at how &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; would be received, but these claims were soon refuted; &quot;it&#x27;s going to be a significant album [...] sure it&#x27;s deep stuff, but it&#x27;s not obscure or gratuitously arty&quot;, declared Bob Merlis, publicity chief for Warner Bros. On March 2, Spain&#x27;s Cadena SER managed to play three of the album&#x27;s tracks: &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, &quot;Love Song&quot;, and &quot;Act of Contrition&quot;. Rafael Revert, SER&#x27;s music manager, explained that the leaks did not come from WEA. Bettina Bose, general manager to WEA Spain, revealed that SER got a reel-to-reel recording from Mexico, which was copied from a raw factory tape. A similar situation occurred in Chicago: On March 15, two days before radio distribution, Ric Lippincott from Z-95 radio station began airing the album on its entirety. Warner Bros sent the station a cease and desist and tried unsuccessfully to contact Lippincott, who revealed that he didn&#x27;t think it was a legit court order, but a &quot;strong request&quot; from the label. The source of the leak remained unknown.

&quot;Like a Prayer&quot; was officially released on March 21, 1989. Initial pressings were scented with patchouli oil to give the album a &quot;church-type feel&quot;. &quot;[Madonna] wanted to create a flavor of the &#x27;60s and the church. She wanted to create a sensual feeling you could hear and smell&quot;, a spokesperson for Warner Bros. explained. The &quot;final serious component&quot; to the album was a factsheet about safe sex and HIV/AIDS. Noting that it is an &quot;equal opportunity disease&quot;, and that &quot;people with AIDS – regardless of their sexual orientation – deserve compassion and support&quot;, it marked the first time a mainstream artist had ever included AIDS-related information within a product. &quot;Attitude&quot;″s Matthew Barton saw this as &quot;further proof of Madonna&#x27;s commitment to, and understanding of, LGBT issues&quot;. To commemorate the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary, a &quot;devoted playlist&quot; was made available on March 21, 2019; it included the original track list ―with the exception of &quot;Promise to Try&quot; and &quot;Act of Contrition&quot;―, remixed versions of the singles, and the previously unreleased &quot;Supernatural&quot;.

== Promotion ==
To market the album, WEA spent over $2 million, their most expensive campaign up that point. Promotional items included different sized posters of the cover and the photograph of Madonna used on the inner sleeve, and badges depicting the logo. Three days before the official release, custom made press kits with a promotional pre-release CD were sent to the media. A patchouli-scented photograph of Madonna&#x27;s bare midriff with the slogans &quot;It Shall Be Released&quot; and &quot;Lead Us Into Temptation&quot; was featured on the spread of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine. In August 1989, to promote &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; in Japan, Warner Music released an extended play titled &quot;Remixed Prayers&quot;, which included several remixes of &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; and &quot;Express Yourself&quot;; it peaked at number 24 on the Oricon chart. The EP was exclusively for Japan until December 1993, when it was released in Australia to coincide with Madonna&#x27;s visit to the country with the Girlie Show concert tour. &quot;Remixed Prayers&quot; reached number 92 on the ARIA Albums Chart, where it was present for three weeks.

=== Live performance and tour ===
On September 6, 1989, Madonna opened the MTV Video Music Awards with a performance of second single &quot;Express Yourself&quot;. She wore an ensemble consisting of baggy pants, a bustier and a monocle, and was joined by Donna De Lory and Niki Haris. The number began with the singer descending from a flight of stairs; she then removes her coat to reveal the bustier and, together with Haris and De Lory, did a dance routine called voguing. The performance received positive reviews from critics; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named it Madonna&#x27;s best, and placed it among the best opening numbers in the show&#x27;s history. Author Ian Inglis singled out the &quot;provocatively choreographed, dance production number&quot; that went on to &quot;highlight the &#x27;TV&#x27; part of MTV, and in a way heralded [Madona] and the network as a cultural arbiter&quot;.

&quot;Like a Prayer&quot; was further promoted on 1990&#x27;s Blond Ambition World Tour, Madonna&#x27;s third concert tour. Originally planned as the Like a Prayer World Tour, it kicked off on April 13 in Chiba, Japan, and concluded on August 5 in Nice, France. The concert was divided into five different thematic segments: &quot;Metropolis&quot;, &quot;Religious&quot;, &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, &quot;Art Deco&quot;, and finally, an encore. The art direction was by Madonna&#x27;s brother Christopher Ciccone, while the costumes were created by French fashion designer Jean-Paul Gaultier. Blond Ambition was awarded &quot;Most Creative Stage Production&quot; award at the Pollstar Concert Industry Awards, and grossed US$62.7 million ($ million in dollars). The tour was subject to controversy due to its sexual and Catholic imagery; Pope John Paul II urged the general public and the Christian community not to attend the concerts, referring to the tour as &quot;one of the most satanic shows in the history of humanity&quot;. In Toronto, the police threatened to arrest Madonna over the performance of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; (1984), which featured her simulating masturbation. Nevertheless, the show went on unaltered.

=== Singles ===

Title track &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; was released as lead single on March 3, 1989. Acclaimed by music critics, who deemed it one of Madonna&#x27;s best, it became her seventh number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, remaining in that position for three consecutive weeks. It was a global success, reaching number one in Canada, Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, United Kingdom, Sweden and Switzerland. The accompanying music video, directed by Mary Lambert, sees Madonna with stigmata on her palms, dancing in front of burning crucifixes and praying to a crying statue of a black saint, who comes to life and seduces her. The Vatican condemned the visual, while family and religious groups protested against its broadcast.

Released on May 9, second single &quot;Express Yourself&quot; received positive reviews from critics, who applauded its gender equality message and deemed it a hymn to freedom and encouragement to women and oppressed minorities. Commercially, the song peaked at number two on the Hot 100 and reached the first spot of the European Hot 100 Singles chart. David Fincher directed the music video, which was inspired by the Fritz Lang classic film &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927). With a budget of $5 million ($ million in dollars), it was the most expensive music video made up at the time. The visual shows a city full of tall skyscrapers and railway lines; Madonna plays two characters: a masculine Marlene Dietrich-like persona, and a submissive wife chained half naked to a bed. Critics noted that the video&#x27;s depiction of female sexuality and Madonna&#x27;s masculine image was gender-bending.

&quot;Cherish&quot; was released as &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;″s third single on August 1, 1989. It was well received by critics, who were surprised by the change of content and the music&#x27;s lighter tone in contrast to the previous singles. In the United States, the single peaked at number two on the Hot 100, giving Madonna the record for the most consecutive top-five singles by any act, with 16. &quot;Cherish&quot; reached the first spot of the Adult Contemporary chart. Herb Ritts directed the music video, which depicts the singer in a beach interacting with mermen. &quot;Oh Father&quot; was released on October 24. It was less successful than its predecessors, peaking at number 20 in the Hot 100 and ending Madonna&#x27;s streak of 16 consecutive top five singles and 17 consecutive top ten singles. Critics reacted positively towards the track, highlighting its confessional nature. The music video, directed by Fincher, was reportedly inspired by Madonna&#x27;s memories of her own mother&#x27;s funeral and shows a little girl stepping up to view her mother&#x27;s coffin only to find the dead woman&#x27;s lips have been sewn shut.

Released on December 4, &quot;Dear Jessie&quot; reached the top 5 in the United Kingdom and Ireland; it was not released in America. Critics compared the track to the work of the Beatles. The music video combines live action and animation, portraying a young girl waking up in bed and interacting with fantasy characters. &quot;Keep It Together&quot; was the final single from &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, released on January 31, 1990. In Australia, it was released on March 20 as a double A side with &quot;Vogue&quot;. It peaked at number 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming Madonna&#x27;s 18th top-ten hit in the United States, breaking the record previously held by Aretha Franklin as the female solo artist with the most top-tens in history.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Like a Prayer&quot; received universal acclaim from critics. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine deemed it Madonna&#x27;s &quot;best and most consistent album&quot;, and applauded its &quot;kaleidoscopic variety of pop styles&quot;. Barry Walters also named it the singer&#x27;s best and most consistent; the author noted the record covers &quot;more stylistic and emotional grounds&quot; than Madonna&#x27;s previous works, and goes beyond &quot;being merely a great assembly of future singles&quot;. Walters concluded that, unlike other records from the time, &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; &quot;truly holds together [as an album]&quot; by &quot;deliberately and quite effectively juxtapos[ing] moods and messages&quot;. He ended his review on a glowing note: &quot;[This] is the album where Madonna crossed the boundary between craft and inspiration. From the start, she&#x27;s had an intuitive grasp of how to put on a good show. Now she&#x27;s got the guts to show us what she has inside&quot;. For Don McCleesee from the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, &quot;this is Madonna&#x27;s best album, and for those who think that such an assertion is damning with faint praise, it&#x27;s a very good album by the standards of any popular artist&quot;. In &quot;Billboard&quot;″s review, &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; was named &quot;less accessible than [Madonna&#x27;s] previous efforts, but [is] ultimately her most satisfying, lyrically and musically&quot;. In the same vein, Rikky Rooksby said it was her &quot;most engaging [and] listenable&quot;. For &quot;Blender&quot;″s Tony Power, &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; is Madonna&#x27;s &quot;most touching, least strident record&quot;.

Daryl Easlea, author of &quot;Madonna: Blond Ambition&quot;, described it as a &quot;personal work of great beauty, and one that delves deep into Madonna&#x27;s soul. [It is] her most accomplished and audacious [album]&quot;. In a similar note, J. D. Considine from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; expressed: &quot;Daring in its lyrics, ambitious in its sonics, this is far and away the most self-consciously serious album she&#x27;s made&quot;. He went on to hail &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, &quot;as close to art as pop music gets [...] proof not only that Madonna should be taken seriously as an artist but that hers is one of the most compelling voices of the Eighties&quot;. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s Sal Cinquemani said it was one of the &quot;quintessential pop albums of all time&quot;, and highlighted its &quot;sophisticated arrangements, deeply felt lyrics, and [Madonna]&#x27;s stronger, more assured vocals&quot;. The staff of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that, &quot;[she] has never sung with more feeling&quot;. &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Edna Gundersen elaborated: &quot;Madonna&#x27;s voice will never be brilliant, but she summons so much emotional intensity on &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; that the calculated come-on in &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; sounds like a disembodied chirp&quot;. In &quot;Encyclopedia Madonnica&quot;, Matthew Rettenmund singled out the &quot;intensely personal lyrics and mature vocals&quot;.

Writing for &quot;Billboard&quot;, Kenneth Partridge considered it Madonna&#x27;s &quot;most introspective and eclectic album to date [...] funky, poignant [...] [it&#x27;s] one of her most fully realized collection of songs&quot;. Jonathan Takiff from &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; praised the album for being &quot;serious and reflective, [and] at times heavily laden with psychic trauma. You might consider &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; to be [Madonna]&#x27;s &quot;Misfits&quot;... or her hour in the confessional box&quot;. Nick Levine from &quot;Vice&quot; referred to it as the singer&#x27;s &quot;first undisputed masterpiece&quot;, that proved she was a &quot;meaningful artist, not just an uncommonly savvy and driven pop star. She bared her navel on the album&#x27;s cover, and her soul in its songs&quot;. From &quot;Spin&quot;, John Leland perceived a &quot;strong sense of independence&quot; throughout the album, comparing its tracks to advice columns and adding: &quot;Within [&quot;Like a Prayer&quot;] [...] there&#x27;s a basic sense of triumph and self worth. [Madonna] expresses herself musically in ways that aren&#x27;t commercial or what people would want from her [...] You won&#x27;t find this sort of breadth in a Janet Jackson record&quot;. Joseph Earp from Australian website Junkee compared &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; to the work of Prince; &quot;his purple shadow is all over [...] That&#x27;s not to take [it] away from Madonna, mind you. At the end of the day, this is the kind of album that only she could release — full of sweet, gasping life, from start to finish. Who else releases a record this smart?&quot;. Maura Johnston, writing for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, classiffied it as a &quot;spectacular&quot; album that proves &quot;just how grand, artistic, and personal a pop star could be at the very height of her fame&quot;. Johnston also noted: &quot;&quot;Like a Prayer&quot; showcase[s] her growth as a pop artist [...] [Madonna] takes more chances lyrically and musically, and while they don&#x27;t always work, they do give a glimpse at her restlessness and increased willingness to take musical chances&quot;.

To the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″ Chris Willman, &quot;her first real entry as a student in the &#x27;confessional&#x27; school of singer/songwriters [...] Madonna&#x27;s fourth is also quite a leap musically--though not always quite as great a leap as you might hope for. [...] The easy admonition of &#x27;You can dance&#x27; has given way to &#x27;Let the choir sing&#x27;, and if [&quot;Like a Prayer&quot;] is far from a perfectly crafted transition in her development, it&#x27;s a perfectly honest one&quot;. More critical was Chaz Repak from &quot;The Cavalier Daily&quot;; he applauded the &quot;improved&quot; songwriting, but wasn&#x27;t convinced with the idea of a &quot;mature Madonna&quot;, concluding: &quot;&quot;Like a Prayer&quot; constitutes [her] best work to date. But after such work as &#x27;Material Girl&#x27;, &#x27;Burning Up&#x27; and &#x27;Open Your Heart&#x27;, that&#x27;s not saying much&quot;. From &quot;Spin&quot;, Christian Logan Wright felt that, &quot;talking about stuff that doesn&#x27;t sit well in pop music [...] [On &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;] your relationship to Madonna changes from to song to song, and it makes you uncomfortable. It&#x27;s like sitting on a table with a friend who&#x27;s telling too much about herself to people she doesn&#x27;t know&quot;. One negative review came from &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot;. Peter B. King criticized the singer&#x27;s vocals, lamented the lack of &quot;catchy&quot; songs, and wrote: &quot;Isn&#x27;t this supposed to be Madonna&#x27;s much-hyped &#x27;confessional&#x27; album? [...] As usual with [her], &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; is a lot more image than substance [...] uninspired dance-floor fodder [...] [that] goes down like flat Pepsi&quot;.

== Commercial reception ==

On April 8, 1989, &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 11. It was Madonna&#x27;s third studio album in a row to enter the top ten in just two weeks.

== Legacy ==

According to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Nicholas Fonseca, &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; marked an &quot;official turning point&quot; in Madonna&#x27;s career, as it earned her &quot;a long-awaited, substantive dose of critical acclaim&quot;. Similarly, the BBC&#x27;s Mark Savage noted that it was the moment when critics first begin to consider Madonna &quot;an artist, rather than a mere pop singer&quot;. According to author Julia Holt, &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; &quot;made [Madonna&#x27;s] critics eat their words&quot;. Kenneth G. Bielen, in &quot;The Lyrics of Civility: Biblical Images and Popular Music Lyrics in American Culture&quot;, wrote: &quot;Five years earlier, [Madonna] was a dance-pop &#x27;Boy-Toy&#x27;. With &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, she proved she was an artist who could think with more than her body&quot;. For Annie Zaleski, it is the singer&#x27;s &quot;first truly substantial&quot; album that separated her &quot;chirpy club-kid days&quot; from the &quot;mature sounds and themes&quot; she would go on to explore in the 1990s. She concluded that, &quot;the album&#x27;s themes of religious and sexual oppression still feel all too relevant. Madonna dictated pop&#x27;s future direction while also being firmly in control of her own fortunes&quot;. In the same vein, Thomas Harrison documented that Madonna &quot;pushed boundaries&quot; by addressing &quot;uncomfortable song topics&quot; in &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;.

Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Lucy O&#x27;Brien expressed that, by &quot;dismantling old Catholic patriarchal messages [Madonna] created a concept album, moving from pop stardom to artistry&quot;. To the staff of &quot;The Advocate&quot;, &quot;&quot;True Blue&quot; started changing minds about Madonna, but [&quot;Like a Prayer&quot;] confirmed [she] was here to stay&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Cameron Cook wrote that Madonna &quot;reshaped the role of “pop star”&quot; with &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, also adding that it is the record where she &quot;not only earned her crown as the Queen of Pop, but rightfully established herself as the Mother of Reinvention&quot;. Sal Cinquemani concluded: &quot;By the late &#x27;80s, Madonna was already one of the biggest pop stars of all time, but with &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, she became one of the most important&quot;. From NPR, Laura Rydell said the album led the way for a new generation of female pop singers to &quot;express themselves&quot;, to which Liza Lentino from &quot;Spin&quot; added that, &quot;[Madonna] lit a blowtorch and poured taboo-based gasoline on restrictions for women in music&quot;. VH1&#x27;s Christopher Rossa held that &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; was the first record to &quot;evoke what female artists explore today: sexuality, religion, gender equality and independence&quot;.

Writing for &quot;NME&quot;, El Hunt noted influence of &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; in the work of contemporary female artists such as Christine and the Queens, Rihanna, and Ariana Grande. Singer Taylor Swift stated that with the album, Madonna made &quot;the most incredible, bold, risky, decisions as far as pop music goes&quot;, calling the title track &quot;legitimately one of the greatest pop songs of all time&quot;. Rossa went on to say that, &quot;[&quot;Like a Prayer&quot;] was pioneering, and no woman in music has come close to doing something as groundbreaking&quot;, and will always be &quot;more influential&quot; than other &quot;iconic&quot; female albums like &quot;Blackout&quot; (2007), &quot;The Fame Monster&quot; (2009), and &quot;Beyoncé&quot; (2013). Nick Levine added:

&quot;[&quot;Like a Prayer&quot;] is a rare beast: an iconic pop album that retains its ability to surprise you, using richly evocative songcraft to explore deeply personal themes—sometimes spiritual, sometimes socially conscious—from a woman&#x27;s perspective. With it, Madonna had once again remodeled people&#x27;s expectations of what a female pop singer could achieve. Decades before Beyoncé&#x27;s &quot;Lemonade&quot; and Ariana Grande&#x27;s &quot;Thank U, Next&quot;, it laid the foundation for the deeply persona pop blockbuster, auteured by a strong woman at the peak of her creative powers&quot;.

&quot;Like a Prayer&quot; is often referred to as one of the greatest albums of the 1980s and of all time. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named it the 239th greatest of all time; nine years later, it dropped to the 239th position on the magazine&#x27;s revisited list. Finally, in 2020, it was allocated at number 331.
In a 2005 poll conducted by Channel 4, &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; was voted the eight greatest album in music history. That same year, it was included among the &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, where it was named the &quot;most spectacular&quot; pop album since the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Revolver&quot; (1966). &quot;Time&quot; deemed it one of the 100 &quot;greatest and most influential musical compilations since 1954&quot;. In 2024, Apple Music ranked &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; 77th on their 100 Best Albums list. &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; was featured in the book &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot;, where it was given a perfect score of 10/10 by reviewer Rob Sheffield; this score is given to albums considered &quot;unimpeachable&quot; masterpieces or &quot;flawed record[s] of crucial historical significance&quot;. It is also considered one of the greatest albums ever made by a woman. In 2015, &quot;Billboard&quot; named it Madonna&#x27;s best studio album that &quot;continues to inspire decades later, and remains [her] thrilling high-water mark&quot;. From &quot;The National&quot;, Saeed Saeed also named it the singer&#x27;s best, adding that, although &quot;[Madonna] went on to release more adventurous material, nothing beats the pure thrills found in this landmark release&quot;. Taraborrelli wrote that, &quot;every important artist has at least one album in his or her career whose critical and commercial success becomes the artist&#x27;s magic moment&quot;, for Madonna, it was &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;.

<text>Comet Borrelly or Borrelly&#x27;s Comet (official designation: 19P/Borrelly) is a comet with a period of 6.85 years that was visited by the spacecraft Deep Space 1 in 2001. The comet last came to perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) on February 1, 2022 and will next come to perihelion on December 11, 2028.

Deep Space 1 returned images of the comet&#x27;s nucleus from 3400 kilometers away. At 45 meters per pixel, it was the highest resolution view ever seen of a comet up until that time.

== Discovery ==
The comet was discovered by Alphonse Borrelly during a routine search for comets at Marseilles, France on December 28, 1904.

== Exploration ==
=== Deep Space 1 flyby ===

On September 21, 2001 the spacecraft Deep Space 1, which was launched to test new equipment in space, performed a flyby of Borrelly. It was steered toward the comet during the extended mission of the craft, and presented an unexpected bonus for the mission scientists. Despite the failure of a system that helped determine its orientation, Deep Space 1 managed to send back to Earth what were, at the time, the best images and other science data from a comet.

<text>Failsworth is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, Greater Manchester, England, north-east of Manchester and south-west of Oldham. The orbital M60 motorway skirts it to the east. The population at the 2011 census was 20,680. Historically in Lancashire, Failsworth until the 19th century was a farming township linked ecclesiastically with Manchester. Inhabitants supplemented their farming income with domestic hand-loom weaving. The humid climate and abundant labour and coal led to weaving of textiles as a Lancashire Mill Town with redbrick cotton mills. A current landmark is the Failsworth Pole. Daisy Nook is a country park on the southern edge.

==Etymology==
Failsworth derives from the Old English and &quot;worth&quot;, probably meaning an &quot;enclosure with a special kind of fence&quot;.

==History==
Early settlement rested on a road that runs today between Manchester and Yorkshire. This Roman secondary road formed part of a network from Manchester up north, probably to Tadcaster near York. The section that ran through Failsworth is still known as Roman Road. It was built above marshland and laid on brushwood with a hard surface. Roman Road has also been known as &quot;Street&quot;, a Saxon term meaning &quot;metalled road&quot;, indicating that it was also used that later period.

Early sources suggest the area was occupied in Saxon times. The small hamlet of scattered dwellings made of rough local stone, mud and clay with thatched roofs, may have been stood on ground higher than the surrounding marshland. Daily life would have centred on animal husbandry and agriculture.

Unmentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086, Failsworth appears in a record of 1212 as &quot;Fayleswrthe&quot;, a settlement was documented as a estate or manor comprising four oxgangs of land. Two oxgangs at an annual rate of 4 shillings were payable by the tenant, Gilbert de Notton, to Adam de Prestwich, who in turn paid tax to King John. The other two oxgangs were held by the Lord of Manchester as part of his fee simple. The Byron family came to acquire the whole township in the mid-13th century. Apart from a small estate held by Cockersand Abbey, Failsworth passed to the Chetham family and was then sold on to smaller holders.

By 1663, 50 households were registered. Life centred on natural resources, agriculture and stock farming, with many were employed as labourers to work the land, though tradesmen such as a tailor, a felt maker, a shoemaker, a joiner and a weaver supported them. The earliest record of a place of worship is Dob Lane Chapel, dating from 1698.
In 1774, the 242 Failsworth households contained some 1.400 inhabitants, of whom a high proportion were involved in cloth manufacture. Development of the English textile trade was backed by important legislation between 1500 and 1760: a number of acts were passed to encourage it by the compulsory growing of flax. Grants were made to flax growers and duties levied on foreign imports, though Manchester&#x27;s extensive linen trade used yarn imported from Holland and Ireland.

In 1914 the regular Daisy Nook Easter Fair ceased with the outbreak of the First World War, but resumed in 1920. On 8 June 2007, a 1946 work by L. S. Lowry entitled &quot;Good Friday, Daisy Nook&quot; sold for £3,772,000, then the highest bid ever paid for one of his paintings. Another painting by Lowry from 1953, &quot;Fun Fair at Daisy Nook&quot;, sold for £3.4 million in 2011.

==Governance==

Lying within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire since the early 12th century, medieval Failsworth formed a township in the parish of Manchester and hundred of Salford.

After the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, Failsworth joined the Manchester Poor Law Union, a social security unit. Its first local authority was a local board of health set up in 1863 and responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation. The board constructed Failsworth Town Hall in 1880. After the Local Government Act 1894, the area became Failsworth Urban District within the administrative county of Lancashire. In 1933 came a small exchange of land with neighbouring Manchester; in 1954, parts of Limehurst Rural District were added to Failsworth Urban District. Under the Local Government Act 1972, Failsworth Urban District was abolished. Since 1 April 1974 it has formed an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, a local government district within the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. Failsworth contains two of the twenty wards of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham; Failsworth East and Failsworth West.

Failsworth lies in Manchester Central (UK Parliament constituency), represented in the House of Commons by Lucy Powell MP of the Labour Party.

==Geography==

At (53.5102°, −2.1575°) Failsworth lies north-north-west of London, as the southern tip of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, sharing borders with Manchester (north to south-west) and Tameside (south to east). It is traversed by the A62 road between Manchester and Oldham, by the former rail line of the Oldham Loop and by the Rochdale Canal, across its north-west corner. The M60 motorway passes through. For the Office for National Statistics, Failsworth counts as part of the Greater Manchester Urban Area.

The land in Failsworth slopes gently from east to west away from the Pennines and from brooks that bound it on the north-west (Moston Brook) and south-east (Lord&#x27;s Brook). Failsworth has a country park, Daisy Nook, on undulating wooded land on its eastern border largely belonging to the National Trust. It is suited to walking, horse riding, fishing and other pursuits.

==Demography==
===Population change===
==Economy==
Failsworth grew as a mill town around the hat-making industry, which continues in the town. This began as a cottage industry before the firm of Failsworth Hats was set up in 1903 to manufacture silk hats. For a time the company had a factory near the former Failsworth Council offices and it remains in the area to this day. Other activities include electrical goods manufacture (such as Russell Hobbs) by Spectrum Brands, formerly Pifco Ltd), and plastic production and distribution by Hubron Ltd.

In July 2007, the Tesco supermarket chain opened a 24-hour Extra branch superstore on the banks of the wharf. The move was opposed by shop-owners, who claimed they would have lost customers and may have been forced to close. Tesco&#x27;s arrival had been expected to be a catalyst bringing other stores, bars and restaurants to Failsworth. The only other large store is a branch of Morrisons housed in a building constructed on the demolished site of Marlborough No. 2 Mill.

==Landmarks==

A Failsworth Pole in Oldham Road was first raised in 1793 as a &quot;political pole&quot;, although a local historian suggests there were others before and that maypoles probably stood there for centuries. It now stands on a site from which an earlier one blew down in 1950.

After a major restoration of the Pole, clock tower and gardens in 2006, a bronze statue of Benjamin Brierley was placed in the gardens.

At the road junction of the A62 with Ashton Road West stands a cenotaph built in 1923 for over 200 Failsworth men who were killed in the First World War. Attendances at the cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday remain high at about 2,000. The annual parade is led by 202 Field Squadron, RE (TA), which is based in Failsworth. In June 2007 the war memorial was rededicated after a £136,000 makeover and opened by Colonel Sir John B. Timmins.

==Education==
The local comprehensive school is Co-op Academy Failsworth, which moved to a new building in 2008 from two buildings known as Upper School and Lower School. It caters for students aged between 11 and 16. The £28-million project brought the town&#x27;s secondary schooling to come under one roof. It has specialist sports college status.

==Religious sites==


==Transport==

Failsworth&#x27;s main thoroughfare is Oldham Road (A62) between Manchester and Oldham. The M60 is an orbital motorway circling Greater Manchester, with access via Junction 22. Its completion around 1995–2000 saw the installation of a graded junction and other notable changes to the A62. It led to several rows of buildings around the junction being demolished.

There are frequent buses through Failsworth between Manchester city centre and Oldham on First Greater Manchester&#x27;s 83 overground service. There is also a frequent service to Manchester city centre and to Huddersfield/Saddleworth via Oldham, with services 180 and 184. Other bus destinations from Failsworth are Ashton-under-Lyne, Chadderton, Huddersfield, Rochdale, Royton, Saddleworth, Shaw &amp; Crompton and Trafford Centre.

Failsworth tram stop in Hardman Lane is on the Oldham &amp; Rochdale line of the Manchester Metrolink. At peak times, trams run every 6 minutes south towards via central Manchester and north to Shaw &amp; Crompton or Rochdale via Oldham. At off-peak times, trams run every 12 minutes to East Didsbury and Rochdale. Previously this was an unmanned rail station on the Oldham Loop line serviced by Northern Rail services to Manchester Victoria or Rochdale via Oldham. It closed in October 2009 under Phase 3a of Metrolink extension and re-opened as a tram stop in 2012.

<text>Jonathan Donald Stanhope (born 29 April 1951) is a former Australian politician who was Labor Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory from 2001 to 2011. Stanhope represented the Ginninderra electorate in the ACT Legislative Assembly from 1998 until 2011. He is the only ACT Chief Minister to have governed with a majority in the ACT Assembly. From 2012 to 2014 Stanhope was Administrator of the Australian Indian Ocean Territories, which consists of Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands.

==Early years and background==
Stanhope was born in Gundagai, New South Wales. He was one of nine children of schoolteacher parents who had emigrated from England. At age 5 he injured his knee, which developed into osteomyelitis, resulting in one leg being 2.5 inches longer than the other. He walked with a pronounced limp until the issue was corrected surgically at age 16. Much of his junior education was spent at one-teacher schools in country NSW. He attended Mullumbimby Public School and Bega High School before coming to Canberra to undertake studies at the Australian National University, graduating as a Bachelor of Laws.

Between 1979 and 1987, Stanhope held a range of community roles including:
* President ACT Council for Civil Liberties
* Original co-convener of Racial Respect in the ACT
* President ACT Hospice and Palliative Care Society
* ACT convener of the National Coalition for Gun Control

Between 1987 and 1991, Stanhope was Secretary of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs; and between 1991 and 1993, Deputy Administrator and Official Secretary of Norfolk Island. From 1993 to 1996, Stanhope worked as Senior Adviser and Chief of Staff for the Federal Attorney-General, Michael Lavarch, and between 1996 and 1998, advised the then Federal Opposition Leader, Kim Beazley, on native title.

==Political career==
Stanhope was elected to the ACT Legislative Assembly representing the Ginninderra electorate at the 1998 ACT general election and was immediately elected Opposition Leader by the Labor caucus.

At the 2001 ACT general election, Stanhope defeated the Liberal government of Gary Humphries, although with a hung parliament, and was elected Chief Minister. In the lead-up to the election, Stanhope played a major role in the Bruce Stadium affair that led to the resignation of the then Chief Minister, Kate Carnell.

On 13 January 2003, Stanhope helped rescue a helicopter pilot who had crashed in a dam during a firefighting operation. Stanhope, who was in a second helicopter with crew and the ACT head of the bushfire services, Peter Lucas-Smith, had responded to the stricken pilot&#x27;s Mayday call. The man had suffered serious head injuries and was taken to the Canberra Hospital in a critical condition. After the rescue Stanhope praised the emergency services: &quot;It provided to me a very stark awareness of the enormous risks that many in our community take, the extent to which so many people put their lives on their line to ensure the protection of our communities&quot;.
Canberra was hit by bushfires in January 2003. Four people died and 500 houses were destroyed. Stanhope faced a no-confidence motion in the Assembly from the Liberal opposition, which if passed meant he would have been forced to resign as Chief Minister. Instead, the motion was downgraded to a censure motion by the combined vote of the ALP and the Democrats and passed in the Assembly. The coronial inquest into the bushfire was released in mid-December 2006, and found significant bureaucratic failings contributed to the devastation, although it also claimed shortcomings at a political level.

At the 2004 ACT general election, Stanhope led the Labor Party to win sufficient seats to form a majority government, the first such government in the Territory&#x27;s history.

As Chief Minister, he introduced a Human Rights Act, in 2004, the first jurisdiction in Australia to do so. In 2005, Stanhope published the confidential draft of the Federal Anti-Terrorism Bill 2005 on his website. Citing concerns about the removal of basic human rights, Stanhope later refused to sign a revised version of the legislation, becoming the only state or territory leader to do so.

In June 2006 Stanhope came under fire over the 2006–07 ACT Budget which was crafted to address ongoing budget deficits. The budget included massive rate rises, across the board fee hikes, a change in the ACT&#x27;s emergency services management and the proposed closure of 38 schools and colleges through consolidation. The budget outcome led to ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s having to add qualification before reaffirming the ACT&#x27;s AAA credit rating. Additionally the decision regarding distribution of the education budget prompted outcry in one Australian newspaper, with the Sydney-based &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; labelling him &quot;Stanhope-less&quot; and an &quot;economic vandal&quot; on the front page of a special ACT edition.

Soon after the budget the ACT&#x27;s Civil Unions Act, to allow formal recognition of same-sex relationships, was overturned by the Federal Howard government despite the objections of the ACT Government and its federal senators. The Rudd Government had advised it was not Labor policy to stifle state legislation, and that it would not block attempts by the ACT government on this issue. Despite this, the Rudd Government later threatened to override any laws introduced in the ACT that legislated for same-sex ceremonies. As a result, the Stanhope Government removed provisions for ceremonies in its proposal, and ultimately allowed for civil partnerships that did not include legislated ceremonies. The Stanhope Government reported that the number of new civil partnerships entered into &quot;exceeded expectations&quot;.

In 2006 Stanhope became the ACT&#x27;s longest serving Chief Minister, exceeding the record previously held by Kate Carnell.

On 26 November 2007, following the resignation of the Northern Territory&#x27;s Clare Martin, Stanhope became Australia&#x27;s longest-serving incumbent state or territory leader. When Kevin Rudd was sworn in as Prime Minister of Australia on 3 December 2007, replacing John Howard, Stanhope became the country&#x27;s longest-serving incumbent head of government.

At the 2008 ACT general election, Stanhope led the Labor Party to win sufficient seats to form a minority government, again with a hung parliament. After almost two weeks of deliberations, the Greens chose to support a minority Labor government.

During his time in office, Stanhope also held the office of Attorney-General from 14 November 2001 to 18 April 2006. During this period, he sponsored a significant rewrite of the civil law of the ACT - including the passage of the Civil Law (Wrongs) Act 2002, the Civil Law (Sale of Residential Property) Act 2003 and the Civil Law Property Act 2006.

On 9 May 2011, Stanhope announced his intention to resign as Chief Minister and as a member for Ginninderra. He formally resigned as Chief Minister on 12 May, and as a Member of the Legislative Assembly on 16 May 2011. The casual vacancy in the Assembly, caused by Stanhope&#x27;s resignation, was filled by Chris Bourke.

==After politics==
Stanhope accepted a professorial fellowship in the Australia and New Zealand School of Government, based at the University of Canberra, commencing in August 2011.

On 17 August 2012, Stanhope was appointed Administrator of the Indian Ocean Territories (Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island) by Governor-General Quentin Bryce. His two-year term ended in October 2014, and he was replaced by Barry Haase.

<text>Raymond Collishaw, (22 November 1893 – 28 September 1976) was a distinguished Canadian fighter pilot, squadron leader, and commanding officer who served in the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) and later the Royal Air Force (RAF). He was the highest scoring RNAS flying ace and the second highest scoring Canadian pilot of the First World War. He was noted as a great leader in the air, leading many of his own formations into battle. After the Great War, he became a permanent commissioned officer in the RAF, seeing action against the Bolsheviks in 1919–20, and subsequently commanding various Air Service detachments. During the Second World War, he commanded No. 204 Group (which later became the Desert Air Force) in North Africa, achieving great success against the numerically and technologically superior Italian Air Force. He was retired in 1943.

==Early life==
Raymond Collishaw was born in Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada, on 22 November 1893. His father was John Edward Collishaw from Wrexham, Wales, and his mother Sarah &quot;Sadie&quot; Jones from Newport, Wales, but raised in Pantygog, Garw Valley. He was brought up in Nanaimo, though some of his schooling took place in Victoria, British Columbia and Oakland, California, due to his father&#x27;s occasional pursuit of gold mining.

In 1908, at the age of 15, thanks to his father&#x27;s connection, Collishaw joined the Canadian Fisheries Protection Services as a cabin boy. He was a lower class sailor on board the &quot;Alcedo&quot;. He would continue working on ships and the coast for the next seven years – working his way up to First Officer, and in 1914, transferring to the &quot;Fispa&quot;. He was aboard when it sailed into the Arctic Circle in search of the Stefansson expedition – too late to rescue the &quot;Karluk&quot;.

==First World War==
===Training===
When war broke out in 1914, Collishaw&#x27;s first idea was to join the Royal Navy, but did not hear from them for some time. Toward the end of 1915, Collishaw heard that the Royal Naval Air Service was hiring, and so he applied to them instead, and attended flight training (ground school and dual instruction) at the Curtiss Aviation School in Toronto (at his own expense). He qualified as a probationary pilot in January 1916 and crossed the Atlantic on the &quot;Adriatic&quot;. His first posting was to the naval air station at Redcar, where he completed his pilot training, flying the Caudron G.3; his first solo taking place 16 June 1916. After attending the Gunnery School at Eastchurch, he was confirmed as a full flight sub-lieutenant.

===RNAS 3 Wing===
On 2 August 1916 Collishaw was deployed to his first operational posting, joining the RNAS&#x27;s 3rd Wing. The wing was operating out of Luxeuil, France and supporting the French 4th bombardment group, flying the British Sopwith 1½ Strutter. Some of the Sopwiths were equipped as bombers, while others were configured as two-seat fighters. Collishaw found these new aircraft &quot;a revelation&quot; to fly (compared to his trainer aircraft). His initial sorties were with the &quot;fighter&quot; Strutter configuration – which he noted, &quot;doubtless influenced significantly my subsequent air force career.&quot;

Collishaw&#x27;s first encounter with a German aircraft was while flying escort duty on 3 Wing&#x27;s first large-scale raid into Germany, against the Mauser Rifle Factory at Oberndorf, on 12 October 1916. The raid consisted of 27 aircraft from both British and French squadrons, and had multiple flights at different altitudes. Collishaw&#x27;s was nearly at their target when they were attacked by three German Fokker D.IIIs. One of the Fokkers, flown by a Sgt. Hanstien, carried out effective attacks against two Collishaw&#x27;s wing-mates on either side of him. Collishaw dived and fired, having Hanstein in his sights, but Hanstein then quickly evaded with a climbing maneuver. Collishaw&#x27;s engine revved too high in the dive, shearing a wire and becoming under-powered, requiring him to return to base. Collishaw noted that while a significant event, the Oberndorf raid was of questionable success given the limited known target damage and allied aircraft losses, without any aircraft losses from the German side. The German pilots on-scene that day were quite experienced, and included the then-NCO Ernst Udet.

Collishaw&#x27;s first confirmed victories occurred on 2 October, while he was ferrying a new Strutter from Wing Headquarters (at Luxeuil) to his squadron&#x27;s new forward base (at Ochey, France) alone (without an observer). Six German scouts spotted him and dived across the lines. As Collishaw recounted:

Collishaw then attempted to return to allied lines, but had become disoriented. He couldn&#x27;t make out his compass, but based on the position of the sun, he flew in what he presumed was the correct direction, gaining altitude and flying for what seemed to him to be a long time. Finally he spotted an aerodrome, and so he went in for a landing.

Collishaw again flew for a long time, making sure to cross the trenches this time, and finally landed at a French aerodrome, 70 miles northwest of his intended destination. He received medical treatment for his eyes and returned to his unit.

3 Wing participated in a number of larger air raids on targets deep into German territory in November and December. Collishaw&#x27;s usual post was as a &quot;fighter&quot; support, and in this capacity he had a few engagements, but with no conclusive outcomes. On 23 January 1917, returning from a wing raid at the blast furnaces at Burbach, he had a &quot;particularly desperate&quot; encounter with a Fokker D.III, and he was forced down on the allied side near Nancy. The next day, in recognition for his participation in the many raids of 3 Wing, he was informed he had been awarded the French Croix de Guerre.

===No. 3 Naval Squadron===
In February 1917, Collishaw was posted to No. 3 Naval Squadron, which had just been established at the beginning of the month and was operating in direct support of the army and RFC at Vert Galand near Somme plain, and equipped with the then-somewhat-dated Sopwith Pups. The squadron, though British, was a majority Canadian outfit at the time in terms of pilot membership. One thing Collishaw noticed was that the pace of missions had steeply increased: instead of flying raids every week or two, as had been done at 3 Wing, at Naval 3, pilots could expect one or more patrols every day, and rarely without some sort of enemy encounter. In addition, the squadron was within operational distance of some of the best German air units, including Jasta 11. Thankfully, as Collishaw noted, &quot;many of the German pilots who flew the new Albatros and Halberstadt fighters seemed to be inexperienced and unable to get the most out of their machines.&quot; Collishaw had a number of combats while out on frequent patrols over the ensuing two months, but suffered regular frustrations due to gun and engine malfunctions. Still, he added two to his tally before suffering another incident where, in combat at high altitude, bullets once again hit his goggles, and in response he threw off his entire face-mask, causing his face to become badly swollen by frostbite. This required him to return to England for a few weeks on sick leave.

===No. 10 Naval Squadron===
 When Collishaw returned to service in late April, he was posted to No. 10 Naval Squadron as a flight commander. Once again, Collishaw discovered that the squadron was mainly Canadian by composition. Naval 10 was slowly being equipped with the new, fast-climbing and maneuverable Sopwith Triplane, and Collishaw found the aircraft &quot;delightful&quot;, though still wished for a second forward-firing Vickers machine gun. (Collishaw eventually received one of six experimental Triplanes with two synchronized Vickers guns, along with a 130HP Clerget engine.) He had his first combat in a Triplane on 28 April, firing on a two-seater in the morning (but foiled by a gun jam), and then later in the day attacking four German fighters (while covering a disabled seaplane off Nieuport) and possibly surprising them with its performance. He swirled onto the tail of one of them, and firing a few bursts, caused it to break-up mid-air. The other Germans then broke off. This was Collishaw&#x27;s 5th victory, making him an &quot;ace&quot;. He had another victory on 30 April, and on 10 May, downed his first opponent in flames. Collishaw again noted a jump in the number of daily sorties being flown, usually 2–4 per day, and sometimes more.

By the middle of May, the Royal Flying Corps was badly in need of reinforcements. This was mainly due to the after-effects of Bloody April, but also because of preparations for a new offensive at Messines. Naval 10 had been earmarked as a unit to offer this direct support, a fact the squadron commander and pilots of the squadron had known for some time. Naval 10 shifted to a new aerodrome at Droglandt.

===The Black Flight===
Collishaw&#x27;s &quot;B&quot; Flight of Naval 10 would initially be composed entirely of Canadians, and would later be nicknamed the &quot;Black Flight&quot;, owing to the flight&#x27;s black (front) engine cowling and wheel covers (to contrast with the red and blue of Naval 10&#x27;s &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; Flights, respectively). In addition, the flight decided to give their machines names in large (3-inch) white letters on either side near the cockpit. Ellis Vair Reid, of Toronto, flew &quot;Black Roger&quot;; John Edward Sharman, of Winnipeg, flew &quot;Black Death&quot;; Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Ewart Nash, of Stoney Creek, flew &quot;Black Sheep&quot;; Marcus Alexander, of Toronto, flew &quot;Black Prince&quot;; and Collishaw chose &quot;Black Maria&quot; (a reference to a police van). During their first two months they claimed a record 84 German aircraft destroyed or driven down – which, strangely enough, brought Collishaw and the unit no wide publicity, though garnered a great deal of renown among their German opponents in the area. Collishaw later claimed that this was because officials in the regular Royal Flying Corps were loath to give credit to naval pilots. In his autobiography, Collishaw noted that they did not always fly together, and operational conditions demanded that pilots of the various flights be available to sub-in on an as-needed basis – and on different machines (which were serviced after about 30 flying hours). There were only a relatively small number of occasions where the full-strength &quot;original&quot; flight were in the field. He maintained that the squadron as a whole should be given credit in terms of whatever legend exists of the &quot;Black Flight&quot;.

The original group&#x27;s first (uneventful) flight, a line patrol, took place on 18 May 1917. Gerry Nash was the first to score a victory, on 21 May, after diving on a flight of five German scouts, and leaving the pilot of his target slumping back in his cockpit, entering a side-slipping spin. Outnumbered, Gerry was then able to use the excellent climbing ability of the Triplane to exit the fight vertically. It was 31 May before Collishaw was able to properly engage two enemy aircraft, though indecisively.

Collishaw then began a week-long streak of kills, with at least one per day, starting on 1 June, when &quot;B&quot; Flight was out in full force, having three separate engagements within their 2½ hour sortie. Collishaw shot an Albatros down in flames, and Ellis and Gerry / Nash (shared) both scored victories. 2 June began with a hostile air patrol – Collishaw&#x27;s flight being dispatched to intercept a German two-seater aircraft spotted over the lines. Sending it down out-of-control, their next sortie was escorting some F.E.2b reconnaissance aircraft. When a group of German scouts approached, Collishaw led the attack, and sent one down out-of-control. On 3 June Collishaw (then a flight sub-lieutenant) received his first promotion, to acting flight lieutenant. Members of &quot;B&quot; Flight were up on four separate occasions that day, Collishaw scoring one German Albatros in flames. The same day, flight sub-lieutant (F/S/L) Percy McNeil (Toronto), leader of &quot;A&quot; Flight, was shot down by German ace Karl Allmenröder, and John Sharman was appointed to lead &quot;A&quot; Flight, being replaced in &quot;B&quot; Flight by F/S/L D. F. FitzGibbon (British). 4 June saw Collishaw on another four sorties, with the last of them yielding another victory shot down in flames. 5 June started with a long-range high-altitude offensive patrol over Menin; Collishaw leading a whole-formation firing charge against a two-seater, which went down in flames. Later Collishaw dived below another two-seater, firing a long burst that sent the plane into a long spin, FitzGibbon also connecting a burst as it fell away. 6 June brought a coordinated effort, Collishaw&#x27;s leading another flight (total of 10 aircraft) in an offensive patrol. At 16,000 feet, the flight ran into a two-seater being escorted by some 15 German fighters. A dogfight ensued, Collishaw quickly downing two in flames, one after the other. Going after a third, his bullets made the pilot fall back as the aircraft plunged into a spin. Nash had gone after the two-seater, and put several bursts into it before it went down, all the way into the ground. He then fired a quick close-range burst at a German fighter, which resulted in it taking a nearly vertical nose-dive. Reid focused on a Halberstadt, maneuvering to keep peppering the fighter as it went down. Various other members of the Naval 10 patrol scored victories as well, and after 35 minutes, 10 of the German aircraft had been either destroyed or thrown from the dogfight in a spin, with no allied losses. Two subsequent large patrols that day, led by Collishaw, encountered no further German aircraft. Finishing the week, Collishaw shot-up one additional Albatros in another large dogfight on 7 June, which fell into a cloud.

9 June brought a close call, and the destruction of the original &quot;Black Maria&quot; (Triplane N.5490). On the early-morning two-flight offensive patrol, Collishaw&#x27;s flight dived on a formation of German Albatros D.IIIs. He got on the tail of a German fighter, who upon noticing his position, went into a wild series of tight turns, which Collishaw&#x27;s Triplane could slightly out-perform. Getting into a favorable position, he was just about to open fire when a stream of bullets smashed into his cockpit, from a German aircraft that had made a diving attack out of the sun. Collishaw&#x27;s controls were effectively disabled, and his plane drifted off to the side and began a series of turning swoops and dives. Initially terrified, Collishaw&#x27;s descent over 15 minutes gave way to resignation, and he recalled &quot;thinking rather wistfully how nice it would be to have a parachute.&quot; Miraculously, the Triplane&#x27;s descent pattern of swoops ended up making contact with the ground at an angle that, while folding the Triplane into a mass of wreckage, left Collishaw with nothing but a few bruises. Luckier still, Collishaw had come down within striking distance of the forward British trenches, and a party of them recovered Collishaw, administering &quot;the type of stimulant that one might be expected to appreciate after such an experience...&quot; He vowed to never let himself be attacked out of the sun. Upon returning to base, Collishaw flew Nash&#x27;s Triplane N.5492.

On 14 June, Collishaw was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross – his first British decoration. On the same day, Jasta 11 was transferred to Marcke, almost directly opposite Naval 10&#x27;s aerodrome at Droglandt. Ten days later, on 24 June 1917, Naval 10 would meet Jasta 11 directly on the morning patrol. Losses would be registered on both sides, with Karl Allmenröder scoring one. The next day, 25 June, Allmenröder scored another. This time, however, it was an original Black Flight member, coming after they had scored an aggregate total of over 50 victories. Gerry Nash, after a desperate maneuvering battle, was hit and suffered a critical failure of his controls. He was forced to land in German territory – destroying his plane before he was captured. Collishaw and the rest of the flight were deeply grieved at the loss – they had not seen Nash go down – but heartened when they eventually learned he had not been killed.

Two days later, on 27 June 1917, Collishaw would encounter Allmenröder again. Out on patrol, Collishaw&#x27;s flight spotted a formation of three Albatrosses below him, while also being aware of another flight of German fighters watching from above. He reasoned he could attack them quickly and climb away, so led his flight down in pursuit and from long range (more than 100 yards) let off several bursts.

Indeed, Nash heard the church bells ring for the funeral of Allmenröder, whom his guard said had been shot down by the leader of the Black Triplanes.

6 July 1917 was Collishaw&#x27;s most successful day. Diving to the aid of some beleaguered F.E.2d&#x27;s who were surrounded by what he estimated to be around 30 German fighters, Naval 10&#x27;s two flights turned the situation into a wild dogfight. Descending onto the rear of a red Albatros, Collishaw took a few burst shots which he thought connected with the pilot and it began going down. No sooner had he made this observation than he had to take violent evasive action to avoid an incoming attack. This whirlwind process continued five more times – each time yielding a damaged German plane exiting the battle. Other members of Collishaw&#x27;s force scored victories as well, and had accounted for a further four aircraft before the dogfight dissolved. Collishaw was credited with six aircraft shot down out-of-control. The next day, Collishaw was awarded the Distinguished Service Order.

Collishaw suffered two frightening experiences in mid-July. The first was an episode where he had to take very violent evasive action to avoid colliding with a German fighter, snapped his restraining straps and was ejected from the cockpit of his plane – only catching his arms around the top wooden struts, and only able to wrestle back into the cockpit after the Triplane had careened down about 10,000 feet. The second was when shrapnel from anti-aircraft fire sent two sizable pieces of his engine cowling flying, one catching in the wing wires, drastically changing the drag profile of the plane and throwing it into a dangerous spin. Managing as best he could to regain control (by varying all control surfaces and the throttle) and fly the plane, he had no choice but to have a hard landing just past the British line, breaking the plane&#x27;s undercarriage, but nothing much else.

22 and 28 July were sad days for the squadron, and Collishaw especially, for they marked the losses of John Sharman and Ellis Reid, respectively – both being killed. Sharman&#x27;s Triplane was struck by anti-aircraft fire and disintegrated mid-air. Reid, it was suspected, fell prey to pilots from Jasta 11. Reid had been Naval 10&#x27;s second-highest scorer, with 19 kills.

===Leave to Canada===
In August, Collishaw returned to Canada for two months&#x27; leave, the British Empire&#x27;s second-highest-scoring living ace. He was virtually unknown, in stark contrast to the grand reception given to the top-scoring living ace, Billy Bishop, when he returned on leave in September. As he recalled, &quot;I was astounded to see so few visible reminders of the war in Canada.&quot; He took his time crossing the country to his home in Nanaimo, stopping in some larger cities to visit the families of pilots he had known who had been killed. He also was invited to address some Men&#x27;s clubs. Collishaw visited his home and became engaged to his future wife.

===No. 13 Naval Squadron===
Returning to the war late November, Collishaw was made a flight commander at No. 13 Naval Squadron, which was equipped with Sopwith Camel fighters, and was operating from Dunkirk (St. Pol), doing escort duty with the Channel Patrol. He noted that the pace of sorties was much relaxed compared to what he had experienced at Naval 10 – only once was he up more than once per day. As a result, over his two months with the squadron, he only added one victory to his tally.

One interesting event during this period was an air battle between his squadron and a formation of German scouts in which no shot was fired. Collishaw was leading the entire squadron, providing high-altitude protection for an observation machine at 20,000 feet. A German formation approached, and Collishaw led his pilots to the attack – but found that his guns had jammed; the temperature being so low the oil had frozen. Several times he turned to attack the Germans, and each time they withdrew, until the reconnaissance was complete and both sides returned home. Collishaw later learned that all the squadron&#x27;s guns were jammed and, years after the war, he met with the German flight leader from that day, who explained that they had experienced the exact same thing. As Collishaw described, &quot;It was surely one of the fiercest and most harmless aerial combats of the war.&quot;

Collishaw was abruptly made a squadron commander on 29 December, after his predecessor was injured in a crash. He received a promotion to that effect several days later.

===Squadron Commander – No. 3 Naval / No. 203 Squadron RAF===

On 23 January 1918, Collishaw returned to the embattled area of the Western Front to command No. 3 Naval Squadron (stationed at Mont-Saint-Éloi), one of his previous units. Collishaw found that serving as a commanding officer took up a great deal of his time with &quot;paper work&quot;, and as a result, his flight time was significantly curtailed until June. Tactics at the time had shifted: much larger flights needed to be deployed to avoid being overwhelmed by the larger German formations on patrol; and aircraft were now being called upon to do low-level strafing attacks on enemy positions and troops. These attacks were urgently requested after the Germans launched their Spring Offensive, and their forces were rapidly breaking through and rushing through open territory. These advances eventually brought the aerodrome under shellfire, and forced No. 3 Naval to shift bases to Treizennes. On 1 April, the RNAS and the RFC merged into the Royal Air Force, and No. 3 Naval became No. 203 Squadron RAF. Collishaw remained in command with the new rank of major. On 9 April 1918 the situation at the front had improved, and the squadron moved closer to the lines at Liettres – soon joined by Collishaw&#x27;s old Naval 10 (now No. 210 Squadron RAF). The squadron later shifting to Le Hamel, Collishaw finally got back into the air in early June, and his flight time increased further in July. On 4 July, Collishaw learned he had been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. This was followed on 1 August with a bar to his Distinguished Service Order. Scoring intermittently, Collishaw remained in command of 203 Squadron until 21 October, when he was recalled to London, England. He had been credited with 60 victories.
In London, Collishaw learned he was to be posted back to Canada, and was in the midst of a tour of the latest pilot training procedures in Britain when the Armistice was signed. He was informed by the Air Ministry that he might participate in an attempt to fly across the Atlantic using a &#x27;Super&#x27; Handley Page V/1500 long-range bomber, but this was scrapped due to unwanted media publicity. He took an extended leave in Canada before returning to England in the early Spring of 1919, being promoted to lieutenant colonel.

==Russia 1919==

In the Spring of 1919, civil war was raging in Russia. The British government decided that in addition to the current Military Mission that acted in support of General Anton Denikin&#x27;s White Russian forces, a squadron would be sent to operate under him, and Collishaw was chosen to be in command. Collishaw arrived at Novorossiysk (in the Crimea area) on 8 June 1919, and took command of No. 47 Squadron RAF on 13 June, though it wasn&#x27;t until 11 July before he could travel in-person to meet them at their operational base at Krasnodar. The Squadron was at the time outfitted with Airco DH.9s. Sopwith Camels would arrive in a reinforcement shipment in September. Given most of the ground fighting in the region was being conducted by horseback cavalry units, the squadron was tooled and designed to operate out of special rail trains – one for each flight (there eventually would be four) – which would be able to quickly follow the front lines, jumping from one suitable makeshift aerodrome or landing site to another.

The squadron&#x27;s operations were incredibly effective against Red Army forces, mainly consisting of troops, cavalry, and some occasionally hardened positions. Collishaw and his pilots were adept at using their advantages and equipment to maximum effect – reconnaissance, bombing, and strafing inflicted thousands of casualties (particularly after receiving a detachment of Sopwith Camels) on the Red Army and assisted greatly in the initial advances of the White Russian forces through the summer and fall. Their operations were conducted with relative impunity – though small-arms fire would at times get intense, and some fortifications and ships housed dangerous arrays of anti-aircraft batteries. The squadron met with virtually no airborne resistance throughout the campaign, only on a few occasions shooting down some Nieuport and Albatros aircraft (displaying various markings – some having black crosses) that attacked. Collishaw himself, flying a Camel, attacked and destroyed one of these enemy aircraft on 9 October. In early-mid October, just as White Russian forces secured their widest gains to-date, Collishaw came down with Typhus Fever, which was wildly endemic in the region. He was reduced to a comatose state for more than a week, but slowly regained his strength. While recovering, he learned he had been awarded the Order of the British Empire for his service in Russia.

By November 1919, White Russian advances had stalled and their over-extended lines had to be pulled back. Leadership and allegiances among the White Russian forces was also beginning to strain as the Red Army was beginning to turn the tide of the battle with incremental advances and occasional breakthroughs. While flight operations continued, weather was deteriorating as winter drew nearer. Bolshevik advances steadily became more rapid and numerous, and Collishaw&#x27;s forces were increasingly often required to cover retreats. This required they shift bases more rapidly to keep out of harm&#x27;s way, and led to more intense operational and logistical problems. In at least two instances, planes and materiel were lost to the Red Army as they overtook them.

By the end of December, Red Army advances had become uncontrollable in some areas, and Collishaw&#x27;s flight train was cut off from the rest of the squadron. This forced the trains – containing troops, refugees, and Collishaw&#x27;s flight – to go in a different direction, through hostile (though undefended) territories. It also meant going without supplies such as munitions, food, coal, and water for the locomotives, all of which had to be foraged at regular stops along the rail line by available troops in the combined army trains. To make matters worse, word reached them that the Red Army had dispatched an armoured train after them, boasting a front-mounted 9-inch howitzer. Forward rail lines were occasionally being damaged by hostile peasants, requiring makeshift repairs to keep the train moving. Progress was painfully slow, and as the armoured train closed distance to them, things became increasingly anxious and desperate. At one point, the Red Army train did make visual contact with them – fortunately just as Collishaw&#x27;s train rounded a bend. The Red Army followed-up a few days later by sending an unmanned run-away locomotive down the line, that succeeded in smashing into the back of into Collishaw&#x27;s train, destroying at least eight cars, and requiring a reconfiguration of the train before they could proceed. Finally, on 4 January 1920, the train reached Crimea, and the &quot;nightmare&quot; as Collishaw called it, was over.

At this point, the campaign was worsening significantly, as Denikin&#x27;s forces were split and had no meaningful hope of closing the gap. Flight operations recommenced in February. Collishaw&#x27;s closest call during this campaign, besides the chase by rail and his fight with typhus, was while leading a late-February bombing raid in a DH.9 – his engine was hit by gunfire from the ground, causing it to lose most of its horsepower. Forced to land, he was incredibly fortunate that his engine remained functional (though reduced) and recent weather had combined (being very cold and windy, filling in any dips or trenches in the landscape) to make possible the subsequent twenty miles of taxiing he completed in his aircraft to friendly territory.

In March 1920 the RAF received orders to evacuate. Collishaw noted that his experiences in Russia were far more frightening than those on Western Front – including as they did the many aspects of civil war, a typhus epidemic, and many desperate refugees.

==Inter-war years==
After 47 Squadron was withdrawn from Russia, Collishaw was sent to Egypt to command No. 84 Squadron. The squadron was moved to Persia, which was made a British protectorate after the war, to defend against the Russians. In the 1921 New Year&#x27;s Honours List, Collishaw was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire.

Returning to England, Collishaw was married to his Canadian fiancée, Neita Trapp in late 1923. He attended RAF Staff College in May 1924, and then shifted to command the re-formed No. 23 Squadron, still in England. In 1927, he became the Head of the Department for Operations and Intelligence with the Air Defence of Great Britain (later RAF Fighter Command). In July 1929, he was promoted to wing commander and posted to Malta, serving as the Senior RAF officer aboard HMS &quot;Courageous&quot;, until September 1932. Transferring back to England Collishaw took command of RAF Bircham Newton, then the station of bomber squadrons Nos. 35 and 207, which were organized as special service units able to rapidly deployed abroad. After three &quot;dull&quot; years there, Collishaw secured a promotion to group captain in 1935, and transferred from Upper Heyford to Sudan to command No. 5 Wing RAF – this in response to the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. After the cessation, he then transferred to the RAF base at Heliopolis, the ensuing years of which Collishaw found &quot;the most pleasant of all those that I spent in uniform.&quot;

On 18 April 1939 Collishaw was promoted to air commodore, and took over as Air Officer Commanding &quot;Egypt Group&quot; at Cairo (which would later become 202 Group in September, and after Collishaw&#x27;s time, the Desert Air Force). Given the perceived impending war with Germany, Collishaw &quot;set about to mould Egypt Group into an operational force capable of carrying out its responsibilities...&quot;

==Second World War==
At the commencement of the Second World War in 1939, Collishaw concentrated on strategy and tactics to neutralize the Italian air force and to gain aerial superiority in North Africa. This was a tough challenge considering that he was greatly outnumbered (150 aircraft vs. the Italians&#x27; nearly 400), and his men were flying outdated Gloster Gladiator biplane fighters and Vickers Wellesley bombers. Soon after the war started Collishaw&#x27;s men were off the mark quickly, striking at an Italian airbase destroying 18 aircraft within two days of the commencement of hostilities with only three aircraft losses. He then turned their efforts to bombing harbours, ships and troops to hold up the reinforcement of North Africa. They damaged the Italian cruiser &quot;San Giorgio&quot; and blew up an ammo dump.

In October 1940, Italy declared war on Greece. This put increased pressure on Collishaw in the form of robbing him of some of his aircraft – sent to aid Greece by the British. However these transfers were paid back in December by fortunate shipments (transport convoys had to run a very dangerous gauntlet through the Mediterranean) of Hurricanes and Wellington bombers – several squadrons worth. Collishaw still didn&#x27;t have the numbers (about 48 fighters / 116 bombers to the Italians 191 fighters / 140 bombers), but it was a better situation than before, and this time he had the technological edge. Using these forces, Collishaw offered good support to the British ground offensive into Libya that launched early December as Operation Compass. The offensive had not been planned to advance too far, however they caught the Italians completely by surprise and were able to push deep into enemy territory, taking Benghazi on 6 February 1941. It was a stunning victory, both on land and in the air. As Collishaw noted, by the end of the offensive:

Collishaw&#x27;s efforts were specifically recognized by the commanders of the operation. In March 1941 he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath.

With the Italians in disarray, Churchill again took some of Collishaw&#x27;s forces and sent them to Greece. While Collishaw&#x27;s forces were thereby reduced, he still argued with senior command that British forces should pursue the fleeing Italians to push them completely out of Libya without delay. However with the slow arrival of the Germans in Tripoli, the decision made was to remain in-place. It was not long before aircraft of the Luftwaffe began to provide serious opposition, and their aircraft (particularly the Junkers Ju 87 and Ju 88, and Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Bf 110) being considerably superior to available British forces in Egypt. Logistics, supply, and equipment issues made resisting German air attacks much more difficult. With Italian air reinforcements also starting to flow in, Collishaw&#x27;s forces were starting to lose more aircraft than they were being supplied with. Rommel&#x27;s advances meant that the RAF and supporting units were often being employed to cover retreats. Command of the RAF was restructured in April, Collishaw now commanding the 202 Group. In May, a badly-needed convoy arrived carrying 50 Hurricane fighters. With the failure of Operation Battleaxe in June, British forces were seen as in need of reorganization. While Collishaw&#x27;s air forces were holding their own and providing excellent support, losses were mounting, and replacement crews were relatively inexperienced.

In July 1941, Collishaw, like many senior British commanders who had been in action Africa, was recalled from the desert. He was replaced with Air Vice-Marshal Coningham. Promoted to his final rank of Air Vice Marshal, he was given a headquarters posting in Fighter Command in Scapa Flow, Scotland, and remained there until July 1943, when he &quot;was retired&quot;. He spent the rest of the war as a Civil Defence Regional Air Liaison Officer, returning to Canada at war&#x27;s end.

==Later years and legacy==

In his retirement, Collishaw pursued some varied involvement with mining companies, just like his father had before him. In his spare time, Collishaw would often research First World War aerial history, corresponding widely with former pilots, historians, and enthusiasts.

His memoirs were titled &quot;Air Command, A Fighter Pilot&#x27;s Story&quot; and were published in 1973.
Collishaw died on 28 September 1976 in West Vancouver, British Columbia at the age of 82.

He was widely noted – by those who served with him or under him – as a very competent and charismatic leader, in all his various capacities. He emphasized camaraderie amongst his men, socializing, and humour.

He was often seen smiling, and had a dutifully cheerful demeanour. As Collishaw would attest in his memoirs, this was a strategic priority:
Given the difficult state of record-keeping and victory standards from the First World War, there have been various historians – and even Collishaw himself, in some ways – that have thought Collishaw&#x27;s real aerial victory count should be higher. As with some other distinguished First World War flight and squadron leaders, Collishaw was supposedly noted as occasionally helping bolster the confidence of new pilots by attributing victories or successful combat actions to them.

Royal Canadian Air Cadets 205 Collishaw squadron, named after him, is in his home town of Nanaimo, and 204 Black Maria squadron, named after his aircraft, is located in Kamloops.

On 2 October 1999, the terminal at Nanaimo Airport was named the Nanaimo-Collishaw Air Terminal in his honour.

<text>Gary John Joseph Humphries (born 6 July 1958) is a Deputy President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. He was a member of the Australian Senate representing the Australian Capital Territory for the Liberal Party of Australia from 2003 to 2013. He was the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory from 2000 to 2001; and was elected to the first parliament of the Australian Capital Territory, in 1989, later representing the Molonglo electorate until 2003.

==Early career==
Humphries was born in Sydney in 1958 and was educated at St Patrick&#x27;s College, Strathfield before graduating from the Australian National University in Canberra with a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Laws. In 1977 he was elected President of the ANU Students&#x27; Association. He worked as a solicitor, a legal office in the ACT Administration, prior to self-government, and political advisor to Senator Amanda Vanstone.

==Political career==

===Australian Capital Territory politics===
Humpries was elected to the unicameral ACT Legislative Assembly at the 1989 election. This election formed the first self-government of the Australian Capital Territory. Humphries represented the Liberal Party in a multi-member electorate covering the whole of the ACT. Humphries was re-elected at the 1992 (again in a single electorate), and at the 1995, 1998, and 2001 elections, in the multi-member electorate of Molonglo.

Humphries variously served in a range of shadow ministerial roles in the Kaine and Carnell oppositions. In late 1989, when Trevor Kaine became the Chief Minister in a hung parliament, Humphries was appointed Minister for Health, Education, and the Arts. He held this position until the Labor Party led by Rosemary Follett regained government in mid-1991. Humphries became the Leader of the Opposition for a short time in 1991, and again in 2001–02.

In 1995, when Carnell became the Chief Minister, Humphries was appointed to the following portfolios:
* Minister for Arts and Heritage; Environment, Land and Planning; Police and Emergency Services; and Fair Trading (1995–1998)
* Attorney-General (1995–2000)
* Deputy Chief Minister (1997–2000)
* Minister for Health and Community Care (1998)
* Minister Assisting the Treasurer (1998–1999)
* Treasurer (1999–2001)

In 2000, Humphries succeeded Carnell as Chief Minister, retaining the portfolio of Treasurer. At the 2001 election, the Liberal government lost office. The Australian Labor Party, led by Jon Stanhope formed Government with the support of the ACT Greens and Democrats.

===Federal politics===
In December 2002, Humphries was elected by the party membership as nominee to fill a forthcoming casual vacancy in the Senate caused by the announced resignation of Margaret Reid. Reid formally resigned on 14 February 2003, and Humphries was elected by the ACT Legislative Assembly on 18 February to fill the casual vacancy. The appointment made him the 500th person to serve in the Senate.

In 2004 there was speculation the Liberals would reject his preselection for the Senate spot, but he won the ballot unopposed 97 votes to 43 votes (43 people voted for &#x27;none of the above&#x27;). Humphries was re-elected at the 2004 federal election with 1.1361 quotas. Unopposed in the pre-selection ballot held on 26 June 2007, Humphries was chosen to contest the election later that year, and was again re-elected to the Senate at the 2007 federal election, receiving 1.03 quotas. Humphries&#x27; Senate seat was targeted by online activist organisation GetUp, as part of a campaign to prevent any one political party from having a majority of the seats in the federal upper house. The profile of the campaign was bolstered by polling that suggested that, for the first time, a Liberal Senator might struggle to retain their seat in the ACT.

Humphries was the first Liberal senator to vote against the Howard Government in its 11.5 years in office, when he voted to reverse the Federal Government&#x27;s ban on the ACT&#x27;s civil unions law in the Senate, claiming that the Commonwealth should not be able to automatically overturn ACT legislation.

Humphries has served on several Australian Senate committees, including the Select Committee on Mental Health (2005–2006). In 2006, he became Chairman of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs. and is currently the Deputy Chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs—Legislation Committee and Chair of the Privileges—Standing Committee with an active involvement in many others.

In 2009, after the election of Tony Abbott as the Leader of the Opposition, Humphries was promoted to the front bench as the Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Families, Housing and Human Services and Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Citizenship. He was re-elected at the 2010 federal election, with 1.0118 quotas and was retained on the Opposition frontbench as Shadow Parliamentary Secretary to the Shadow Attorney-General and Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Materiel in September 2010.

On 23 February 2013 Humphries lost Liberal pre-selection to one of his successors as ACT Liberal Leader, Zed Seselja. This happened with much controversy, in particular over party members, including many prominent ones, being barred from voting. The result was 114 (Seselja) to 84 (Humphries), or 58% to 42%. A re-election was held on 27 March 2013 with a higher membership turnout and vote, but it failed to overturn the result. The vote, 168-138 or 55%-45%, was closer than the first one.

Humphries&#x27; term as a senator came to end on 6 September 2013, the day before the 2013 election.

There was much bitterness and controversy in the aftermath of the Senate preselection result. For example, Humphries refused to attend a dinner that the party executive held for him, because of the way that it had been organised. In May 2014 Humphries was stripped of the Margaret Reid Award for distinguished service, a noteworthy party presentation, by the party&#x27;s management committee. This was for comments critical of the party and some of its members, such as Opposition Leader Jeremy Hanson, who became Opposition leader after Seselja replaced Humphries as a Senator.
One critique in particular, about the Canberra Liberals losing touch with the ACT community, raised the committee&#x27;s ire, and drew a public rebuke from Hanson.

A faction called the Menzies Group was organised in response to the preselection result and the perception that the far right of the Canberra Liberals was running the party. Humphries was involved in setting up this faction.
It was active for a time,

but now seems to have receded.

On 14 December 2014, Humphries quit the Canberra Liberal Party. In an email, he told supporters that the Canberra Liberal Party in its current state was, amongst other things, undemocratic, still out of touch with the ACT community, unable to control its finances, and dominated by its far right. Hanson again publicly rebuked Humphries.

==Later career==
Upon leaving the Senate, Gary Humphries took on a role as a lobbyist with 1st State Government and Corporate Relations. Since 2014 Humphries has been a regular contributor to the Canberra-based RiotACT and to the Fairfax press, particularly &quot;The Canberra Times&quot;.

Humphries was appointed Chair of the Anzac Centenary Public Fund Board in March 2014.

He was appointed a Deputy President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal from January 2015.

<text>Helga (derived from Old Norse &quot;heilagr&quot; - &quot;holy&quot;, &quot;blessed&quot;) is a female name, used mainly in Scandinavia, German-speaking countries and the Low Countries (&quot;Hege&quot;, &quot;Helle&quot;, &quot;Helge&quot;, &quot;Helga&quot;, &quot;Helka&quot; or &quot;Oili&quot;). The name was in use in England before the Norman Conquest, but appears to have died out afterwards. It was re-introduced to English-speaking nations in the 20th century from Germany, the Netherlands, and the Nordic countries. Scandinavian male equivalent is Helge, or Helgi. Eastern Slavic names Olga (Ольга) and Oleg (Олег) are derived from it.

Name days: Estonia - May 31, Hungary - October 3, Latvia - October 9, Sweden - November 21, Finland - May 31, Greece - 11 July

Helga was among the most popular names for girls in Germany from the 1920s to the 1950s.

<text>Al Hawza or al Hauza was an Arabic language weekly newspaper in Iraq.

==History and profile==
&quot;Al Hawza&quot; started publication in 2003 after the removal of Saddam Hussein, and American media considered it to be the mouthpiece for Shi&#x27;ite cleric Moqtada Sadr. It was a weekly newspaper published every Thursday. The paper was a religious cultural publication. Its chairman was Abbas Al Rubayi. Hasan Al Zarkani served as the editor. Ali Yasseri was the editor of the paper when it was suspended.

It was shut down by the 759th Military Police Battalion, under orders of the United States-led administration of Paul Bremer on 28 March 2004, after being accused of encouraging violence against Coalition troops. The closure of the weekly was protested by hundreds of Iraqis in Baghdad shortly after the ban.

<text>Sir Richard McBride, (December 15, 1870 – August 6, 1917) was a British Columbia politician and is often considered the founder of the British Columbia Conservative Party. McBride was first elected to the provincial legislature in the 1898 election and served in the cabinet of James Dunsmuir from 1900 to 1901 as Minister of Mines. McBride believed that the province&#x27;s system of non-party government was unstable and hindered development. The lieutenant-governor appointed him the 16th premier in June 1903 and McBride announced that his government was a Conservative Party administration and would contest the upcoming election along party lines. On October 3, 1903, McBride&#x27;s party, the British Columbia Conservative Party won the first provincial election to be fought along party lines with a two-seat majority.

Richard McBride is interred in the Ross Bay Cemetery in Victoria, British Columbia.

==Premier of British Columbia==
The new Conservative government attempted to stabilize the economy by cutting spending and raising new taxes. It also introduced progressive reforms of the province&#x27;s labour law. In 1909 McBride unveiled plans for a provincial university and promised to build more railway lines. The party won commanding majorities in the 1909 and 1912 elections, almost shutting the Opposition out of the legislature.

McBride&#x27;s Conservatives were aligned with the federal Conservatives of Robert Borden and helped them take power in the 1911 federal election. On the first day of the First World War, the provincial government purchased and took possession of two submarines ( and ) to defend the province from the threat of German attack. As provinces are not constitutionally allowed to maintain militaries, they were quickly transferred by order to the federal government within 48 hours and entered service with the Royal Canadian Navy in August 1914.

His government was also responsible for the creation of the province&#x27;s first university, the University of British Columbia, which opened its doors in 1915.

The government&#x27;s popularity waned as an economic downturn hit the province along with the mounting railway debts. McBride resigned on December 15, 1915, to become the province&#x27;s representative in London, where he died in 1917.

During his time as Premier, he also served as Minister of Education (1903 to 1904), Minister of Lands and Works (1903), Minister of Mines (1903 to 1915), President of the Council (1913 to 1915), and Provincial Secretary (1903 to 1904).

==Legacy==
The small community of McBride, British Columbia, was named after this premier during the time he was in office. Also named for the premier, the McBride River in northern British Columbia is a major tributary of the Stikine.

Richard McBride Elementary School (now renamed to Skwo:wech Elementary School) in New Westminster was built in 1912 and replaced the Sapperton School nearby, after burning down it was rebuilt as the current school being completed in 1929. Sir Richard McBride Elementary School in Vancouver was named after him in 1911 during his tenure as Premier as well as McBride Park in Kitsilano on July 26, 1911. (During World War I the park was used for the cultivation of vegetables.) Mount McBride, a peak in Strathcona Park on Vancouver Island, is also named after the premier.

Also named for him is McBride Boulevard in New Westminster which is the western ramp for the Pattullo Bridge.

<text>Alistair is a male given name. It is an anglicised form of the Scottish Gaelic &quot;Alasdair&quot;. The latter is most likely a Scottish Gaelic variant of the Norman French Alexandre or Latin Alexander, which was incorporated into English in the same form as Alexander. The deepest etymology is the Greek Ἀλέξανδρος (man-repeller): ἀλέξω (repel) + ἀνήρ (man), &quot;the one who repels men&quot;, a warrior name. Another, not nearly so common, Anglicization of &quot;Alasdair&quot; is &quot;Allaster&quot;.

<text>Arabinose is an aldopentose – a monosaccharide containing five carbon atoms, and including an aldehyde (CHO) functional group.

== Properties ==
For biosynthetic reasons, most saccharides are almost always more abundant in nature as the &quot;&quot;-form, or structurally analogous to -glyceraldehyde. However, -arabinose is in fact more common than -arabinose in nature and is found in nature as a component of biopolymers such as hemicellulose and pectin.

The -arabinose operon, also known as the araBAD operon, has been the subject of much biomolecular research. The operon directs the catabolism of arabinose in &quot;E. coli&quot;, and it is dynamically activated in the presence of arabinose and the absence of glucose.

A classic method for the organic synthesis of arabinose from glucose is the Wohl degradation.

==Etymology==
Arabinose gets its name from gum arabic, from which it was first isolated.

== Use in foods ==
Originally commercialized as a sweetener, arabinose is an inhibitor of sucrase, the enzyme that breaks down sucrose into glucose and fructose in the small intestine.

<doc id="561167" wikidata="Q4864776" url="?curid=561167" title="Music of São Tomé and Príncipe">
<text>São Tomé and Príncipe is an island country off the coast of Africa. Culturally, the people are African but have been highly influenced by the Portuguese rulers of the islands.

São Toméans are known for ússua and socopé rhythms, while Principe is home to the dêxa beat. Portuguese ballroom dancing may have played an integral part in the development of these rhythms and their associated dances.

Tchiloli is a musical dance performance that tells a dramatic story. The danço-congo is similarly a combination of music, dance and theatre.

==Popular music==
The godfathers of São Toméan popular music was the band Leoninos, which was founded in 1959 by Quintero Aguiar. The group were well known as spokesmen for the people of São Tomé and Príncipe, and were champions of their culture. Leoninos was banned by the Portuguese radio station after he released &quot;Ngandu&quot;, which criticized the Portuguese colonialists.

Leoninos broke up in 1965, but were followed by Os Úntués, led by Leonel Aguiar, who added American, Argentinian, Congolese and Cuban musical influences, and introduced the electric guitar and other innovations. Popular music from the islands began to diversify, as bands like Quibanzas and Africa Negra. Among these groups was Mindelo, who fused São Toméan rhythms with rebita, an Angolan style, to form puxa.

In the latter part of the 20th century, songwriters like Zarco and Manjelegua found a domestic audience, and São Toméan-Portuguese musicians like Camilo Domingos, Juka, Filipe Santo, Açoreano, Gapa established a Lisbon-based scene.

Other 21st century singers who follow similar steps are Flavia, Bruna Lee, Marisyah, Calema.

===Kizomba===

Kizomba is an Angolan popular music and it was born out of Zouk music. Kizomba supports a fairly large number of artistes singing in both English and Portuguese.

<text>Broadway Video is an American multimedia entertainment studio founded by Lorne Michaels, creator of the sketch comedy TV series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and producer of other television programs and movies. Broadway Video also held the rights to much of the pre-1974 Rankin-Bass library and Lassie from 1988 to 1996 before they sold the rights to Golden Books Family Entertainment (now owned by NBCUniversal/Universal Pictures via DreamWorks Animation/Classic Media).

==History==

Lorne Michaels, who launched &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1975, produced several television specials under the banner of Above Average Productions before incorporating Broadway Video in 1979. Michaels took the company&#x27;s name from its location at 1619 Broadway in the historic Brill Building in New York, New York. Initially, the company&#x27;s principal activity was videotape post-production. One of its main clients was NBC, which hired Michaels to produce and edit &quot;Best of Saturday Night&quot; specials that aired in prime time. The specials and other comedy and musical projects helped Broadway Video grow &quot;from a one-room operation into a first-class production company, the foundation of a small empire.&quot;

Broadway Video later &quot;prospered&quot; by moving into home entertainment, acquisition, and international syndication. With offices in New York and Los Angeles, the company has continued to develop films and TV programming. Its sitcom, &quot;30 Rock&quot;, ran for seven seasons between 2006 and 2013. Besides &quot;SNL,&quot; its current TV productions include &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; and &quot;Late Night with Seth Meyers,&quot; The company&#x27;s Above Average Productions distributes its own original digital shorts, and those of others, on one of YouTube’s leading comedy networks.
Broadway Video Enterprises distributes the company&#x27;s library and develops branded entertainment. Broadway Video Ventures invests in emerging technology, media, and entertainment companies. His production company signed a film deal with Universal Pictures in 2018 after its original deal with Paramount ended.
