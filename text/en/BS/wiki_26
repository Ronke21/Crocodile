<text>Pinus engelmannii, commonly known as the Apache pine, is a tree of Northern Mexico, in the Sierra Madre Occidental with its range extending into the Southwestern United States. This pine is a medium-sized species with a height of and a trunk diameter of .

The branches are sparse and very stout, giving the tree a distinct appearance. The needles, among the longest of any pine, are in bundles of three (occasionally five), long, stout, and spreading to slightly drooping. The cones are long, green or purple when growing, maturing glossy brown, moderately oblique with stoutly spined scales on the outer side (facing away from the branch). The Apache pine sometimes shows a grass stage like the related Michoacan pine (&quot;P. devoniana&quot;) and also longleaf pine (&quot;P. palustris&quot;).

The English name refers to the species&#x27; occurrence in the lands of the Apache Native Americans, while the scientific name commemorates the pioneering American botanist George Engelmann who discovered the species in 1848. Engelmann first named the species &quot;Pinus macrophylla&quot;, but this name had already been used for another pine, so it had to be renamed; this was done by the French botanist Carrière, who chose to honour Engelmann.

Apache pine was sometimes treated as a variety of ponderosa pine in the past (as &quot;P. ponderosa&quot; var. &quot;mayriana&quot;), but it is now universally regarded as a distinct species.

<text>The Oldsmobile 98 (spelled Ninety-Eight from 1952 to 1991, and Ninety Eight from 1992 to 1996) is the full-size flagship model of Oldsmobile that was produced from 1940 until 1942, and then from 1946 to 1996. The name – reflecting a &quot;Series 90&quot; fitted with an 8-cylinder engine – first appeared in 1941 and was used again after American consumer automobile production resumed post-World War II. It was, as it would remain, the division&#x27;s top-of-the-line model, with lesser Oldsmobiles having lower numbers such as the A-body 66 and 68, and the B-body 76 and 78. The Series 60 was retired in 1949, the same year the Oldsmobile 78 was replaced by the 88. The Oldsmobile 76 was retired after 1950. This left the two remaining number-names to carry on into the 1990s as the bread and butter of the full-size Oldsmobile lineup until the Eighty Eight-based Regency replaced the 98 in 1997.

Occasionally additional nomenclature was used with the name, such as L/S and Holiday, and the 98 Regency badge would become increasingly common in the later years of the model. The 98 shared its General Motors C-body platform with Buick and Cadillac.

Since it was the top-line Oldsmobile, the series had the most technologically advanced items available, such as the Hydramatic automatic transmission, the Autronic Eye, an automatic headlight dimmer, and Twilight Sentinel (a feature that automatically turned the headlights on and off via a light sensor and a delay timer, as controlled by the driver), and the highest-grade interior and exterior trim.

==First generation (1941)==
Naming standards were in flux at Oldsmobile during the late 1930s and 1940s. From 1932 through 1938 Oldsmobile had two series: &quot;F&quot; and &quot;L&quot;. F-Series came with a straight 6 engine and L-Series came with a larger body and a straight 8 engine. The F-Series was replaced by the Series 60 in 1939 and L-Series was replaced with the Series 70. The Series 60 used the GM A-body and the Series 70 used the B-body. In 1940 the even larger C-body was introduced to Oldsmobile and it alone was powered by the straight-8. The series were also given names for the first time that year with the Series 60, 70, and 90 being called the Special, Dynamic, and Custom Cruiser respectively. In 1941 both engines were offered on each series so to differentiate between the two the second digit was used to denote the number of cylinders, so the Custom Cruiser 90 was replaced with the Custom Cruiser 96 and 98. In 1942 Oldsmobile dropped the six cylinder Series 90 model leaving only the Custom Cruiser 98.

The new C-body that the 1940 Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser Series 90 shared with Cadillac Series 62, Buick Roadmaster and Super, and the Pontiac Torpedo featured cutting-edge &quot;torpedo&quot; styling. Shoulder and hip room was over wider, running boards were eliminated, and the exterior was streamlined and lower. When combined with a column mounted shift lever the cars offered true six passenger comfort. The 90 rode on a wheelbase of . A total of 43,658 90s were sold in four body styles. The rarest was the 4-door convertible with only 50 being sold.

In 1941 the wheelbase was increased to . A deluxe equipment package was now offered. The top-of-the line Oldsmobile was available in three body styles on the 96 and in four body styles on the 98. Rarest of these was the 4-door convertible which was exclusive to the 98. Only 119 were sold in 1941 and this would be the only time this body style was ever offered on the 98. The other three body styles were a convertible coupe, a club coupe fastback and a 4-door sedan. This was also the only year in Oldsmobile history that a 96, a 90 series car with a six-cylinder engine, was available. Hydramatic automatic transmission, first introduced in October 1939, was a popular option. A total of 24,726 98s and 6,677 96s were sold in 1941.
== Second generation (1942, 1946–1947)==
In 1942 the Custom Cruiser 98 was once again the Oldsmobile entrant into the luxury market. Gone was the single year offering of the 96. All cars in this series were powered by the straight eight engine. Also gone in this shortened model year was the ultra rare 4-door convertible. An exclusive inch wheelbase was used in the series. A total of 6,659 98s were made before production was shut down due to World War II. To celebrate the company&#x27;s 44th anniversary all Oldsmobiles received a small badge on the grille with &quot;B44&quot; attached. This was not a model designation.

When production was resumed in 1946 the Custom Cruiser 98 remained the top of the Oldsmobile line. Three body styles were offered (a 4-door sedan, a 2-door Club coupe and a 2-door convertible) and all were eight cylinder powered. Technical features included electro hardened pistons, full pressure lubrication and automatic choke with fast idle mode. Standard equipment included front and rear bumper guards, vacuum booster pump, dual sun visors, cigarette lighter and plastic radiator ornament, wraparound bumpers, Deluxe instrument cluster clock, rear armrest, and foam rubber seat cushions. Tire size was by . Available upholstery was either leather, broadcloth, or Bedford cord. 14,364 98s were sold in its first postwar year of production.

In 1947 the top of the line Custom Cruiser 98 again had three body styles. This was the last year for the 98 1942 prewar body. All 98s had the straight eight engine. Standard 98 equipment included safety glass, spare wheel and tire, dual horns, vacuum booster pump, cigarette lighter, and a solenoid starter system. Upholstery was either custom broadcloth or leather. Standard tire size was by . An electric clock was standard in 1947. A record 37,140 98s were sold in 1947.
== Third generation (1948–1953)==
=== 1948 ===

For the first time since 1940 Oldsmobile offered totally different styling during a single model year. The top of the line 1948 Oldsmobile 98 was also included in a marketing campaign for what Oldsmobile called &quot;Futuramic&quot; on all 1949 Oldsmobiles primarily focused on the automatic transmission 1948 Oldsmobile Futuramic introduction. Standard equipment on 98s included a solenoid starter, fender skirts, E-Z-l rearview mirror, and foam rubber seat cushions. The 98s also included front and rear bumper guards, vacuum booster pump, plastic radiator ornament, dual horns, dual sun visors, and cigarette lighter. Deluxe equipment added front and rear floor mats, Deluxe steering wheel, wheel trim rings, rear seat armrests, and hydraulic window, seat and top controls on all convertibles. Upholstery was either broadcloth or leather. The standard tire size was 6.50 x 16-inch. The Custom Cruiser name was retired until 1971 when it was used to denote full-size Oldsmobile station wagons. The new styling was apparently popular with a record 65,235 98s sold, exceeding the number of 90s sold in 1940 for the first time.

=== 1949 ===
The following year the new styling was joined by a new engine, the now famous Rocket V8. In February 1949, several months into the model year, General Motors introduced three highly styled &quot;hardtop convertible&quot; coupes, the Oldsmobile 98 Holiday, the Cadillac Series 62 Coupe de Ville, and the Buick Roadmaster Riviera, the first hardtop coupes ever produced. The Holiday was exclusive to the 98 series that year. Available in four special Holiday colors, as well as four two-tone combinations, it was priced the same as the convertible, and was similarly equipped, with hydraulically operated windows and seat. Only 3,006 Holidays were sold in its first year compared to 20,049 Club coupes. Total sales reached 93,478 in 1949, setting yet another record.
=== 1950 ===
The 1950 Oldsmobile 98 repeated its 1948 precedent of previewing some of next years styling cues for the 88. The 98 was restyled after only two years. It was the first totally slab sided Oldsmobile and the first sedan with wraparound rear windows. A 4-door 98 fastback appeared for one year only in 1950 and was called the Town Sedan, selling only 1,778 units. Standard equipment included bumper guards, dual horns, parking lamps, dome light, rubber floor mats, aluminum sill plates, foam rubber seat cushions, chrome interior trim, lined luggage compartment and counterbalanced trunk lid. Deluxe 98 equipment included rear seat armrest, Deluxe electric clock, Deluxe steering wheel and horn button, special door trim and stainless steel wheel trim rings. Upholstery choices spanned nylon fabric, striped broadcloth or leather. Standard tire size was by . In 1950, Oldsmobile stopped naming the 98 series and so from then through 1996, with the exception of 1957 when it was called the Starfire 98, and in 1961 when it was called the Classic 98, it was simply known as the Oldsmobile 98. Sales of the 98 Holiday nearly tripled to 8263, approaching the 11,989 sold of the Club coupe. Given the rapidly growing popularity of the 2-door Holiday hardtop, 1950 was the last year for the pillared Club coupe. Total sales set yet another record of 106,220.

=== 1951 ===
The 98 topped the Oldsmobile line again for 1951 with Three body styles available. The 4-door sedan and convertible came only with Deluxe equipment, while the Holiday hardtop was available with either Deluxe or Standard trim. The 98 standard equipment included bumper guards, cigarette lighter, dome light, rubber floor mats, stainless steel moldings, lined trunk, illuminated ashtray, foam rubber seat cushions and extra chrome moldings. Deluxe equipment was special rear door ornament, rear center armrests, Deluxe electric clock, Deluxe steering wheel with horn ring and special chrome trim. Upholstery choices were nylon cord, nylon cloth and leather. The pillared Club coupe was no longer offered. With the only choice in a closed 2-door 98 now being the hardtop, Holiday sales nearly doubled to 17,929 units.

=== 1952 ===

From 1952 the car, which remained as the top of the line Oldsmobile, began to be called Ninety-Eight. This would continue until the demise of the model, with the exception of model years 1957 and 1961. The series shared the higher output 160 HP Rocket V8 with the Super 88s. Standard equipment on the three body styles included bumper guards, gray rubber floor mats front and rear, electric clock, dual horns, aluminum door sill plates, chrome gravel guards, foam rubber seat cushions, turn signals, carpeting front and rear, stainless steel wheel trim rings, windshield washer, and Deluxe steering wheel with horn ring. Upholstery selection was broadcloth or six colors of leather. Standard tire size was by . For the first time power steering was an option. Another new option was the Autronic Eye, an automatic headlight dimmer, which in its initial year was shared only with Cadillac.
=== 1953 ===

New in 1953, the Fiesta joined the Cadillac Series 62 Eldorado and Buick Roadmaster Skylark as top-of-the-line, limited-production specialty convertibles introduced that year by General Motors to promote its design leadership. It featured a cut-down belt line, a wraparound windshield that was lower than the standard Ninety-Eight&#x27;s windshield, and special &quot;spinner&quot; hubcaps, which became a trademark on later Oldsmobiles. Virtually every Oldsmobile option was standard except air conditioning, regarded as unnecessary at the time in a convertible.

Mechanically, the Fiesta had a special version of the Ninety-Eight engine which gained 5 horsepower to 170 through manifold streamlining and compression increased from 8.1:1 to 8.3:1. A four-speed Hydramatic automatic transmission and faster rear axle ratio were designed to keep the 4,459 pound shipping weight Fiesta (336 more than a standard Ninety-Eight convertible) up to Oldsmobile performance standards. At US$5,715 ($ in dollars ) (over $700 ($ in dollars ) more than the Skylark) the Fiesta was nearly twice the US$2963 price ($ in dollars ) of a standard Ninety-Eight convertible, with only 458 units produced to its 7,521.

Standard equipment for 1953 included bumper guards, electric clock, lined trunk, dual horns, cigarette lighter, chrome moldings, twin interior sun visors, rear seat robe rails, special rear stainless steel trim, chrome window ventiplanes, windshield washer, and Deluxe steering wheel with horn ring. In 1953 a padded safety dash also became standard on the Ninety-Eight. For the first time air conditioning was an option.

The Fiesta convertible would be gone the next year but its name would be resurrected in 1957 for Oldsmobile station wagons.
== Fourth generation (1954–1956)==
The 1954 Oldsmobiles were redesigned across the line, with a three body style Ninety-Eight series remaining at the top. Convertibles were called the Starfire, after the previous year&#x27;s Starfire dream car. A slightly higher horsepower Rocket V8 was shared with the Super 88 series. Standard Ninety-Eight equipment included bumper guards, rubber simulated carpets front and rear, electric clock, lined trunk, dual horns, cigarette lighter, aluminum door sill plates, turn signals, chrome rocker panel moldings, deck lid ornament, foam rubber seat cushions, padded dash, parking brake light, courtesy light package, stainless steel wheel discs, windshield washer, and deluxe steering wheel with horn ring. Upholstery choices were nylon and leather, in a variety of colors. Standard tire size was by . A slightly modified 1954 Holiday Coupe was used as a press car during the final Carrera Panamericana in 1954. Optional air conditioning was available on sedans and hardtops, which consisted of a self-contained Frigidaire unit retrofitted at the customers request.

The 98 rode on an exclusive wheelbase, longer than the 88. Standard equipment included turn signals, bumper guards, stainless steel moldings, dual horns, cigarette lighter, front and rear floor mats, inside rearview mirror, foam rubber seat cushions, stainless steel rocker panel moldings, front seatback robe cord, spun glass hood insulation, rear window ventiplanes, electric clock, stainless steel wheel discs, custom cushion lounge seats front and rear, hand brake light, courtesy light package, padded dash, Deluxe steering wheel with horn ring, and windshield washer. Upholstery choices were covert and pattern cloth, leather and pattern cloth, leather and nylon, and leather and dimple leather. Standard tire size was by . The optional air conditioning unit was moved to the engine bay instead of the trunk. The turning diameter was 43 ft. The Hydramatic automatic transmission gear selector had an S on it, which was used for better performance climbing hills. At mid-year, Olds introduced the new pillarless four-door hardtop body, dubbed the Holiday Sedan, in the Ninety-Eight series. The 4-door Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight Holiday Sedan, along with the 4-door 88 Holiday and the 4-door Buick Century Riviera and 4-door Special Riviera, were the first 4-door hardtops ever produced. Total Ninety-Eight sales for 1955 set a new record of 118,626.

Power came from the 240 horsepower Rocket V8 shared with the Super 88. Standard equipment included armrests, bumper guards, lined trunk, rotary door latches, dual horns, cigarette lighter, turn signals, rubber floor mats, aluminum door sill plates, sun visors, front and rear carpeting, foam rubber seat cushions, courtesy lights, front fender medallions, deck lid &quot;Ninety-Eight &quot; script, back-up light moldings, electric clock, Jetaway Hydramatic Drive, padded dash, power steering, windshield washers and Deluxe steering wheel. Upholstery choices were pattern cloth and leather in a variety of colors and combinations. Standard tire size was by made by either U.S. Royal, Goodrich, or Firestone. The parking brake was now a foot pedal.
== Fifth generation (1957–1958)==


The Oldsmobile line underwent a sweeping reengineering in 1957, with a 3-piece rear window making a reappearance on some models. Once again the 4-door 98s were at the top, this year officially named Starfire 98. Standard equipment included armrests, turn signals, rubber floor mats, sun visors, front fender chrome script, exposed chrome roof bows, side interior courtesy lights, electric windows, special emblems, power steering, power brakes, and Jetaway Hydramatic. Upholstery choices included a variety of cloth, &quot;Morocceen&quot; (vinyl), and leather. Standard tire size was by . The standard engine was now the Rocket V8. A safety recessed steering wheel was added. Front leg room was .

A major styling change was seen in 1958. The Ninety-Eight series again had its own exclusive wheelbase of 126.5 inches while sharing the more powerful Rocket V8 with the Super 88. The 1958 models shared a common appearance on the top models for each brand; Cadillac Eldorado Seville, Buick Limited Riviera, Oldsmobile 98, Pontiac Bonneville Catalina, and the Chevrolet Bel-Air Impala; the Starfire nameplate was cancelled. Four body styles were available.

Standard series equipment included four headlights, oil filter, turn signals, printed circuit instrument cluster, aluminum anodized grille, padded dash, foam rubber padded seat cushions, courtesy lights, parking brake light, special side moldings, chrome rocker panel moldings, Jetaway Hydramatic transmission, power steering and brakes, dual exhaust, electric clock, color accented wheel discs, and chrome wheel frames. Interiors could be ordered in a variety of colored leathers, cloth, and &quot;Morocceen&quot; vinyl. Standard tires were by . Air suspension was added as an option. Also new was a speed warning device, which could be set towards a certain speed and when the limit was reached, a buzzer would sound, alerting the driver of the vehicle to slow down.

== Sixth generation (1959–1960)==
For 1959, the Oldsmobile line-up was completely redesigned. However, unlike other GM makes (such as Chevrolet and Cadillac) Oldsmobile continued to use a full perimeter frame, instead of the GM X-frame. The Ninety-Eight shared its appearance with the Oldsmobile 88. Oldsmobile stayed with its top series format by offering four body styles on an exclusive wheelbase: a four-door sedan, a two-door hardtop, a four-door hardtop and a convertible. For 1959 and 1960 only, the hardtop body styles were dubbed &quot;Holiday SceniCoupe&quot; and &quot;Holiday SportSedan&quot; respectively, while the convertible continued the traditional &quot;Convertible Coupe&quot; moniker. Each body style had a distinctive greenhouse, shared with other 1959 GM cars. The 4-door sedan had six side windows and a sloping roof; the 2-door hardtop had a very large rear window and thin pillars; the 4-door hardtop sported a &quot;floating roof&quot; look, with a large wrap-around rear window. Standard equipment included oil filter, turn signals, air scoop brakes, Safety spectrum speedometer, rocker panel moldings, special emblems, parking brake light, sponge vinyl headliner, deep twist carpeting, electric clock, wheel trim moldings, power steering, power brakes, and Jetaway Hydramatic Drive. Interiors were selected from leather, &quot;Morocceen&quot; vinyl, or cloth in different colors. Standard tire size was . The , the largest first generation Rocket V8, was used from 1959 until 1964.

For 1960, the Ninety-Eight was completely restyled, while keeping the underlying structure and rooflines of the 1959 models. All four body styles were carried over, and the four-door sedan was renamed &quot;Celebrity Sedan&quot; — a designation used only one year on the Ninety-Eight, but that was continued on 88 sedans up to 1965. Standard equipment included Safety-vee steering wheel, turn signals, air scoop brakes, electric windshield wipers, safety-spectrum speedometer, carpets with rubber inserts, padded dash, courtesy lamps, wheel trim rings, Star-lite headliner, two-speed windshield wipers, chrome roof side moldings, Jetaway Hydramatic transmission, power steering, power brakes, windshield washers, electric clock, and deep twist carpeting. Upholstery was fabric, leather, or &quot;Morocceen&quot; vinyl in a variety of colors. Tire size was . An anti-spin rear axle was optional.

== Seventh generation (1961–1964)==
For 1961, and 1961 only, the Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight was renamed Classic Ninety-Eight ; nevertheless, most factory literature refers to the line as the Ninety-Eight. A fifth body style was added to the four offered since 1955: a 4-door 6-window hardtop, previously exclusive to Cadillac and the Buick Electra. The &quot;Holiday Sedan&quot; name was transferred to it, and the 4-door 4-window hardtop body style was instead called the &quot;Sport Sedan&quot;. This was the first time not all Oldsmobile hardtops were called Holidays. The sedan, which like in the two previous two years was a 6-window body style, was now called the &quot;Town Sedan&quot;. Another peculiarity of the 1961 models was that, with the exception of the convertible, no 98 body styles shared its roofline with the 88. Overall sales dropped from 59,364 to 43,010, the Ninety-Eight&#x27;s low point following the production record set in 1955. Standard equipment included padded dash, Safety spectrum speedometer, floating propeller, air scoop brakes, two-speed windshield wipers, Safety-Vee steering wheel, parking brake lamp, courtesy lamps, oil filter, windshield washer, electric clock, Roto Hydramatic transmission, power steering and power brakes. Upholstery was vinyl, cloth or leather. Standard tire size was 8.50 x 14 inches. With the Rocket now standard equipment on the Oldsmobile 88, a higher compression version was made standard equipment on the 98 and Super 88 with horsepower rising to 325 in 1961 and 330 in 1962. It was dubbed the &quot;Skyrocket&quot; from 1961 to 1963.

The 1961 through 1964 Oldsmobiles lost their dependable (but expensive to build) Jetaway Hydramatic transmissions. Replacing those four-speed units was a much cheaper to build three-speed unit, the Roto Hydramatic. This transmission had no front fluid coupling at all, and utilized a single &quot;fill-and-dump&quot; coupling to perform double duty as both a fluid coupling in third speed while having a third reaction member, which Olds called an &quot;Accel-O-Rotor,&quot; which was actually a small stator, thus giving some limited torque multiplication in first. In theory, the &quot;Accel-O-Rotor&quot; would provide the same multiplication range in first as both the first and second gears of the four speed unit without all the hardware and cost. It was also unique at that time in that second speed was pure mechanical connection from engine to rear end and no fluid coupling involved. The problem with this transmission was that engine speed would race wildly in first, and then hit a &quot;brick wall&quot; of a very steep RPM decline in second, which was equivalent to third gear in the four speed Jetaway Hydramatic. This unit was unpopular and would linger for only these three years, when it was replaced by the Turbo Hydramatic in 1965. Customer complaints caused many dealers and independent transmission shops to wholesale replace the Roto Hydramatic in these cars with older (or contemporary, from a Pontiac Star Chief or Bonneville) HM315 four speed Hydramatic.

The largest 1962 Oldsmobiles were again the Ninety-Eights. Five body styles were offered including three 4-doors plus an open and a closed 2-door. The Holiday Coupe was renamed the Holiday Sport Coupe, and the Sport Sedan was renamed the Holiday Sport Sedan, so once again, at least temporarily, all hardtops were called Holidays. Ninety-Eights were well appointed with standard equipment including padded dash, guard beam frame, live rubber body cushions, coil springs, foam rubber seats, two-speed windshield wipers, parking brake lights, courtesy lamp package, special moldings, Roto Hydramatic, power brakes, power steering, power windows and power seat. Interiors were leather, vinyl or cloth. Standard tire size was 8.50 x 14 inches.
Again, in 1963, the top-of-the-line Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight had an exclusive wheelbase. A new body style was the Custom Sports Coupe hardtop. It was the only body style with the 345 horsepower Starfire engine. The 4-door 6-window hardtop was renamed the Luxury Sedan (often condensed to L/S). The convention of naming all hardtops Holidays would not again return until 1965. Standard equipment included die-cast grille, deep pile carpeting, 21-gallon fuel tank, full-flow oil filter, foam seat cushions, foot-operated parking brake, two-speed windshield wipers, special molding package, Deluxe steering wheel, map light, heavy duty air cleaner, courtesy lights, Roto Hydramatic, power brakes, power steering, special rocker panel moldings, self-regulating electric clock, dual rear seat cigarette lighters and special headliner. Interiors were leather, vinyl or cloth. Standard tire size was 8.50 x 14 inches. Ninety-Eights were now made only in Lansing, Linden, Kansas City, Southgate and Wilmington.

In 1964 the top of the line Ninety-Eight series was offered in six body styles in 2-door, 4-door and convertible configurations. Standard equipment included: Roto Hydramatic; power steering, brakes, windows and seats; windshield washer; special wheel discs; clock; courtesy and map lights and padded dash. Upholstery was a variety of colored cloth, vinyl and leather. Standard tire size was 8.50 x 14 inches. Ninety-Eights were now built only in Lansing.


== Eighth generation (1965–1970)==

The 1965 Ninety-Eight was completely redesigned from the ground up along with other full-sized General Motors cars but retained the larger C-body shared with Cadillac and Buick Electra in contrast with the B-body used in the Oldsmobile 88. The Ninety-Eight featured many of the lines found on 88s but with more squared off styling. The exclusive Ninety-Eight wheelbase had five body styles. The Custom Sport Coupe was gone and the 4-door 6-window body styles were replaced with 4-door 4-window body styles. The Luxury Sedan was no longer a hardtop but featured a more luxurious interior along with more standard amenities than the Town Sedan such as power seats. Most Ninety-Eight Luxury Sedans also had vinyl roofs, which were offered only in black that year. For the first time since 1962 all hardtops were once again called Holidays.

Standard equipment included automatic transmission, power steering and brakes, power windows, clock, padded dash, foam padded seats, parking brake light, Deluxe steering wheel, special wheel covers, windshield washer and two-speed electric wipers, courtesy and glovebox lamps, and front seat belts. Standard tire size was 8.55 x 14 inches. A new three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic automatic transmission with torque converter replaced the three-speed Roto Hydramatic. Along with the transmission and redesigned platform, the engine was also new for 1965: a Super Rocket V8 that was more powerful and of a more efficient design than the Rocket V8 previously used, yet lighter in weight. The four-barrel &quot;Ultra High Compression&quot; version of this engine rated at was the only engine available in 1965. Ninety-Eights were built only in Lansing.

Between 1965 and 1975 Oldsmobile commissioned Cotner-Bevington to build professional cars, (ambulances and hearses), using the large Ninety-Eight chassis.

Some luxury market buyers purchased either the Starfires or the new Toronados in 1966 but the Ninety-Eight remained the full-size top-of-the-line Oldsmobile. Five models, including a trio of 4-doors were available. Standard equipment included: Turbo-Hydramatic transmission; power steering, brakes, windows and seats; special wheel covers; front and rear seat belts; carpeting; windshield washer and two-speed wipers; foam seat cushions; electric clock and special armrests on selected models. Upholstery was cloth, vinyl and leather. Standard tire size was 8.55 x 14 inches. Ninety-Eights were built in Lansing.

For 1967 there were five Ninety-Eight body styles available. Standard Ninety-Eight trim included: armrests, power brakes, dual cigarette lighters, electric clock, carpeting, lamp package, molding package, seat belts, power seats, power steering, Turbo-Hydramatic and power windows. Upholstery was cloth, vinyl or leather. Standard tire size was 8.85 x 14 inches. Ninety-Eight models were built in Lansing. The split grille appearance, which had been implemented in 1966 on the Cutlass and 88 series models appeared on the 98 series.


In 1968 Oldsmobile continued to produce five Ninety-Eight body styles. Standard equipment included: dual master cylinder, four way flasher, energy-absorbing steering column, back-up lights, side marker lights, seat belts, cross-flow radiator, rear armrest ashtrays, power brakes, electric clock, special moldings, shoulder belts, Deluxe steering wheel, power steering, carpeted trunk and Turbo-Hydramatic transmission. Upholstery was cloth, vinyl or leather. Standard tire size was 8.85 x 14 inches. Engine displacement was increased to the Rocket V8 with 365 horsepower. Ninety-Eight production was in Lansing.

The 1969 Ninety-Eight remained the top-of-the-line Oldsmobile. It was the largest Oldsmobile product offered and now had a wheelbase. Six body styles were now available with a hardtop version of the Luxury Sedan added to the lineup. New to the Ninety-Eight series were a recessed padded instrument panel, anti-theft lock within the steering column, rear view mirror map light, mini-buckle seat belts, and deeply padded head restraints. Standard equipment included: power brakes, self-regulating electric clock, full carpeting, courtesy lamps, paint stripes, power seat adjuster, seat belts and shoulder harnasses, power steering, Deluxe steering wheel, power windows, Turbo-Hydramatic transmission, custom sport seat, foam padded front seat, and wheel discs (hub caps). Standard tire size was 8.85 x 14 inches. Upholstery was vinyl, cloth or leather. The Ninety-Eight&#x27;s standard engine was still the Rocket 455 which required premium leaded gas. All Ninety-Eights were made in Lansing and had the code letter M.

Some of the available 1969 options were a tilt-telescope steering wheel, instant horn, four season air conditioning with comfortron, tinted glass windshield, 6-way power seat, divided front seat with dual controls, power trunk release (vacuum), power door locks, power front disc brakes, AM-FM stereo radio, rear seat speaker, stereo tape player (8-track), power operated antenna, door edge guards, cruise control, left outside remote control mirror, cornering lamps, anti-spin rear axle, vinyl roof, flo-thru ventilation, and safety sentinel.

Of the Ninety-Eight series, the 1969s were the only models to have an attached hood extension. After receiving numerous complaints from dealership mechanics about hitting their heads on the extension, Oldsmobile changed the style of the hood in 1970, removing the extension, which resulted in a flat hood design.

In 1970, the Ninety-Eight continued as Oldsmobile&#x27;s largest model. Standard equipment included: Turbo-Hydramatic 400 transmission, power steering, power brakes with front discs, power windows, power seats, Deluxe steering wheel, electric clock and full wheel discs. Standard tire size was J78-15. Interiors were vinyl, cloth or leather. All Ninety-Eights were made in Lansing indicated by the codel letter M in the Vehicle Identification Number. The length grew to 225.2 inches.
== Ninth generation (1971–1976)==

Oldsmobile built its biggest full-size car in 1971 although wheelbase was unchanged from 1970. The Ninety-Eights were the roomiest Oldsmobiles ever built thanks to the new GM full-size bodies which, at 64.3-inch front shoulder room and 63.4-inch rear shoulder room, set a record for interior width that would not be matched by any car until the full-size GM rear-wheel drive models of the early to mid-1990s. The 1971 through 1976 Ninety-Eight was very similar to the Oldsmobile 88 (which by now was called the &quot;Delta 88&quot;) except the Ninety-Eight had a longer passenger compartment owing to its 3-inch longer wheelbase, and had rear Cadillac-esque tailfins to better differentiate between the two full-size models.

The standard 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8 was rated at and designed to run on lower octane regular lead, low-lead or unleaded gasoline for the first time this year thanks to a General Motors-mandate that all engines be designed to run on such fuels in preparation for the catalytic converter equipped cars of 1975 and later years that absolutely required unleaded gasoline. Despite this, a few 1975 and 1976 Ninety Eights were released from this catalytic converter requirement in Canada and were given certification along with exemption from requiring unleaded gasoline. V8s were progressively detuned as production wore on in line with tighter emission standards. Trunk mounted louvers for the flow through ventilation system were only found on 1971 models (as in many other GM models of 1971). The louvers were moved to the doorjambs for 1972-1976 models. From 1971 to 1976, Oldsmobile&#x27;s full-sized Custom Cruiser station wagon shared the wheelbase and 455 cubic-inch V8 with the Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight, and shared its interior and exterior styling, in particular the Ninety-Eight&#x27;s distinctive front fascia and rear quarter panels complete with fender skirts.

The number of body styles was reduced to four for 1971. The convertible was gone as were the 4-door sedan body styles. A new body style was the Luxury Coupe. For the first time ever all Oldsmobile Ninety-Eights were now hardtops, and for the first time since 1964 not all hardtops were called Holidays. Standard equipment included armrests, front and rear, power brakes with front discs, electric clock, carpeting, inside hood release, lamp package, power seat, power steering and Turbo-Hydramatic transmission. Standard tire size was J78-15. Interiors were vinyl, cloth and leather. Ninety-Eights were built in both Linden and Lansing.

Four body styles were offered in the Ninety-Eight series for 1972. Standard equipment included: Deluxe armrests, dual ashtrays, power brakes with front discs, electric clock, carpeting, interior hood release, remote control outside mirror, molding package, interior light package, windshield radio antenna, power seat, power steering, spare tire cover and Turbo-Hydramatic transmission. A midyear version of the 4-door hardtop named the Regency was produced to commemorate Oldsmobile&#x27;s 75th year as an automaker. For the first time in 17 years, the Ninety-Eight set a new sales record of 121,568.

In 1973 a five body style Ninety-Eight series was at the top end of the Oldsmobile line. The 75th anniversary Regency 4-door hardtop continued, following its successful mid-1972 introduction. Standard equipment included: Deluxe armrests, dual ashtrays, power brakes with front discs, cigarette lighter, carpeting, inside hood release, dome light, molding package, windshield radio antenna, foam sheet cushions, power steering, Deluxe steering wheel, Turbo-Hydramatic transmission and wheel opening covers. Standard tire size was L78-15. Upholstery was vinyl or cloth. The Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight set another record of 138,462 sold.

The 1974 Ninety-Eight was now Oldsmobile&#x27;s longest running series dating back to 1941, and was still popular. Five models were offered with the Regency Coupe taking the place of the Luxury Coupe. Standard equipment included: power brakes with front discs, cigarette lighter, electric clock, interior hood release, lamp package, molding package, remote control outside mirror, windshield radio antenna, power steering, Deluxe steering wheel, spare tire cover, power windows, power seat and Turbo-Hydramatic transmission. Standard tire size was J78-15. Upholstery was vinyl, cloth or leather.

From 1974 to 1975 the Ninety-Eight reached a record length of 232.4 in (5903 mm), when federally mandated bumpers were added both front and rear increasing the overall length of the cars by several inches, while 1976 model year saw minimal length reduction to 232.2 in (5898 mm). It is also worth to note that 1974 Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight 4-door hardtop was the longest car with that body style sold that year, since the longer Lincoln Continental, Cadillac Sixty Special and Cadillac Series 75 were basically sedans (and 1974 Lincoln Continental came only with one hardtop body style: the 2-door). The 1974-76 Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight (as well as all full-size Oldsmobiles, Buicks and Cadillacs) also were among the first US production cars to offer an air bag option (&quot;Air Cushion Restraint System&quot;) beginning in 1974. Very few cars were so equipped. The high cost ($700) plus public uncertainty about the yet-to-be proven safety systems that are now universal in today&#x27;s automobiles saw quite handily to that.

The number of Ninety-Eight body styles was reduced in 1975. Four were available consisting of coupes or 4-door hardtops in Luxury or Regency trim. Two door models were no longer hardtops. Standard equipment included: power brakes with front discs, cigarette lighter, electric clock, electronic ignition, hood release, bumper impact strips, lamp package, 455 CID engine, molding package, remote-controlled outside mirror, power seat, power windows, power steering, Deluxe steering wheel, chrome wheel discs and Turbo-Hydramatic transmission. Standard tire size was J78-15. Upholstery was vinyl, cloth or leather.

In 1976 the Luxury and Regency editions of the full-size Ninety-Eights were offered, in 2-door coupes or 4-door hardtops. 4-doors had an extra window (like an opera window) in the C-pillar. A landau roof option for the coupe gave it a huge-looking opera window. Like the Custom Cruiser, Ninety-Eights had a dual section eggcrate-design grille, with new front end panel, front bumper, and wraparound horizontal parking lamps. Amber marker lenses aligned with the headlamps wrapped around the fender sides. Separate clear cornering lamps had horizontal ribs. Vertical taillamps were decorated with a small emblem in each lens. Tiny back-up lamps stood alongside the license plate, on a panel that also contained small red lenses next to the tail lamps. Standard Ninety-Eight equipment included a 455 CID Rocket V8 with 4-barrel carburetor, Turbo-Hydramatic, vari-ratio power steering, power brakes, power driver&#x27;s seat, driver&#x27;s door armrest control console, electronic message center, electric clock, fold-down center armrests, front ashtray, and JR78 x 15 blackwall steel-belted radials. Rear fender skirts and bumper impact strips were also standard. A new 2.41:1 axle ratio became standard to improve fuel economy.

===Ninety-Eight Regency===

For the 1972 model year, the Limited Edition Regency was offered to commemorate Oldsmobile&#x27;s 75th anniversary. Each 1972 Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight Regency was registered at Tiffany&#x27;s and included the specially styled interior with black or covert gold &quot;pillow effect&quot; velour upholstery, and power split bench seat, in place of the power bench seat with a rear clock. Tiffany touches include the Tiffany Gold paint (an exclusive custom metallic color created especially for this car), the clock has also been specially styled by Tiffany&#x27;s and bears a white Oldsmobile emblem above Tiffany&#x27;s name on a golden face. Each 1972 Regency owner received a distinctive sterling silver key ring as a gift. If they were lost, the keys could be dropped in a mailbox, and Tiffany&#x27;s would return them to the owner. A total of 2,650 75th anniversary Ninety-Eight Regency cars were built, all of them four-door hardtops. In 1973 the non-anniversary Regency stayed in the line up slotted just above the LS. The Regency package would remain available on the Ninety Eight through the 1996 model year when it would become a separate model nameplate.
== Tenth generation (1977–1984)==

The 1977 model was redesigned and downsized, like the Delta 88. The new models, at around 4000 pounds curb weight, were over 800 pounds lighter, but headroom and rear seat legroom were increased compared to equivalent 1976 models. The 455 CID engine was replaced by the smaller 403 CID V8, and the Oldsmobile 350 V8 was now the standard engine. The Ninety-Eight set a new sales record of 139,423. A four-door sedan and a two-door hardtop coupe were available.


A diesel version of the 350 was added in 1978. Beginning in 1979, production of the Ninety-Eight was exclusive to Lansing as Linden Assembly was retooled to build the E-body cars. Base LS models were available as sedans only, and the premium Regency model came as either a coupe or a sedan. A limited production top level Regency LX sedan was also offered for 1979.

The Ninety-Eight was restyled for 1980, along with the Delta 88. That year, it gained a new 307 cu in (5.0 L) V8 as an option. The 403 was dropped completely. The 1980 models received new exterior sheet metal, without drastically changing the look of the car. To improve aerodynamics and fuel economy the hood was sloped downward, while the trunk area was higher. This also gave all models a heavier, more substantial appearance, while even slightly increasing interior and trunk space. The 1981 model year saw the introduction of Buick&#x27;s 252 cu in V6 as standard, as well as a new 4-speed THM200-4R automatic transmission; the first standard 4-speed automatic since 1960. The gas 350 engine was dropped that same year, completely replaced by the smaller 307. A redesigned steering wheel and slightly revised instrument panel were also new that year. While the 1981 model used a V6 engine, the model designation stayed as &quot;Oldsmobile 98&quot; instead of being called the &quot;Oldsmobile 96&quot;. The traditional naming convention established in the late 1930s used the second number as the number of cylinders.

The 1983 models received a new grille but were otherwise unchanged. The federal impact standard was rolled back for 1984, prompting GM to make major changes to the bumpers to save weight; predictably, this drastically reduced their effectiveness. An optional 8-track tape player and the 4.1 L V6 were no longer available, though the CB radio was still optional. Production ended in March 1984. These cars were actually sold concurrently with the new front-wheel drive 1985 model. The body style reference in GM Manufacturing became &quot;D&quot; for the carryover RWD models, and the new FWD cars became C-bodies (which had been the designation used hitherto for the RWD cars).

===Ninety Eight Regency Brougham===
The new Regency Brougham model was introduced for 1982 and available for the sedan model only. This car featured plush &quot;Prima&quot; velour seats with embroidered emblems, cut pile carpeting, and electroluminescent opera lamps on the B-pillars. Wire wheel discs were also standard as well as Tungsten halogen headlamps, cornering lamps, full padded vinyl roof, and a tilt steering wheel. Regency became the new &#x27;base&#x27; model as the LS was discontinued. 

== Eleventh generation (1985–1990)==
In 1985, GM downsized the Ninety-Eight again, moving from rear-wheel drive to a new front-wheel drive platform, with sales beginning in April 1984.

Now using GM&#x27;s new C Platform, the revised Ninety-Eight was approximately shorter in length and weighed less than its predecessor. Significantly shorter, narrower, lighter and more fuel-efficient than the platform they replaced, the C Platform Ninety Eights were noted for having nearly the same key interior dimensions as their predecessors and a much more nearly flat passenger compartment floor — albeit with thinner seats and dramatically less upper tumblehome, locating windshield as well as side glass closer to passengers.

1985 model year sales were 169,432 units, contrasted with the 1984&#x27;s 76,833 units, an all-time sales record.

As in previous years, the 1985 Ninety-Eight was available as a four-door sedan and a two-door coupe, in either Regency or Regency Brougham trim. Both models featured standard velour seating, with optional leather seating surfaces, marketed as &quot;Sierra Grain&quot; leather. For the first year, the Buick 181 cu in V6 was the standard engine. V8 engines were no longer used with the Ninety-Eight. Optional engines included Buick&#x27;s 231 and Oldsmobile&#x27;s 263 cu in Diesel V6. The 3.0 gas V6 and 4.3 Diesel V6 were dropped for 1986.

Anti-lock brakes became optional for 1986 and a &quot;Grande&quot; package was offered in 1986 and 1987 with composite headlights and specific front end panel (1986 only), and 45/45 leather seats with pigskin inserts and console with a combination lock.

In what was to be the last year for the 2-door coupe, in 1987 all Ninety-Eights received a revised grille with flush composite headlamps. Late in the 1987 model year a new derivative called the Oldsmobile Touring Sedan was introduced; available only as a four-door sedan with a floor shifter, this version targeted buyers of imported sports-luxury sedans, e.g., those from Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Acura. Treated as a separate model, the nameplate directly recalled the company&#x27;s earlier &quot;Touring Sedan&quot; models from the 1910s and 1920s; it was the first five-passenger full-size Oldsmobile with a center floor console and floor shifter. Officially designated the &quot;W12 option package&quot;, the trim level&#x27;s final assembly was executed by ASC of Michigan. With a base price of just over $24,000 USD (), the Touring Sedan cost roughly 30% more than the most expensive other trim levels of the Ninety Eight. 25,275 examples were built of this version; 3,985 in 1987, 8,531 in 1988, 7,193 in 1989, and 5,566 in 1990. For the next generation, the &quot;Touring&quot; badge was relegated to being a trim level on the Ninety Eight.

There were no changes to the Touring Sedan&#x27;s drivetrain, but Oldsmobile equipped it with the FE3 suspension package (also referred to as &quot;Level 3&quot; or Sport Suspension), featuring a larger front stabilizer bar, an added rear stabilizer bar, firmer suspension bushings, stiffer springs at all corners, upgraded struts, 15&quot; wheels, performance tires and a special steering gear. It also included the Teves four-wheel anti-lock brake system. Externally the Touring Sedan used cloisonné badges on the hood, C pillars and rear quarter panel and the lower body featured model-specific dark gray cladding and fog lamps. The Touring Sedan featured burl walnut veneer accents and twin bucket seats by Lear Siegler with 16-way power adjustments. The rear seats mirrored the articulation (without the adjustability) of the front seats and included an armrest and head restraints. In 1988, a power pull-down trunk lid and an onboard computer with oil life monitor (marketed as the &quot;Driver Information System&quot;) became optional for all Ninety-Eights.

For the 1989 model year, the Ninety-Eight received another grille change and the addition of Twilight Sentinel headlights, optional remote keyless entry, an automatic dimming rearview mirror (which could be turned on and off), and an optional (but rarely ordered) drivers-side airbag. The 1989 Touring Sedan featured gray-painted and rear bumpers matching the side lower body cladding and a 12 aperture grille and headlamp bezels painted a matching gray. Larger, 16-inch &quot;turbine&quot; wheels (shared with the Toronado Troféo) became standard on the Touring Sedan. A redesigned steering wheel included redundant HVAC and audio controls.

By 1990, the engine for the eleventh-generation Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight featured a harmonic balancer and increased horsepower over 1985 models. Also in 1990, a PGA edition package for the Regency Brougham included gold PGA emblems, gold nameplate badging, gold striping, and wire wheels with gold emblems. 1990 would be the last year that the &quot;Regency Brougham&quot; trim level, first introduced in 1982, was offered on a Ninety-Eight. The illuminated steering wheel control buttons now matched the interior color. Auto down driver&#x27;s window, keyless entry, and an electrochromic (auto dimming) rear view mirror became standard on the Touring Sedan.

== Twelfth generation (1991–1996)==
The final generation of the Oldsmobile Ninety Eight coincided with its 50th anniversary in 1991, continuing to use the GM C Platform with added length, rear fender skirts, wide tail, low nose, and a split-grille with wraparound headlights. The wheelbase remained unchanged from the previous generation, and overall length increased by over 9 inches (229 mm), mostly at the rear of the car, resulting in a larger trunk.

The final generation Ninety Eight was available in two main trim levels: the traditional luxury-oriented Regency models and the performance-oriented Touring models. The engine choices included normally aspirated (all years) and supercharged (1992–1995) versions of the 3.8 L V6. The Touring was offered with five-passenger seating and alloy wheels (shared with the LSS). The two-tone body of the previous generation was replaced with a monochromatic exterior (including a body-color grille); all chrome trim was deleted (with the exception of badging). To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Ninety Eight, Oldsmobile offered a &quot;50th Anniversary&quot; package in 1991. This limited edition model was available only in black or white and featured cloisonné front fender anniversary emblems, gold nameplate badging, gold striping, and unique gold accent alloy wheels. The interior was trimmed in burl walnut with gold accents.
In 1992, a new supercharged V6 engine with became available on the Touring edition. The naturally aspirated version produced . Also that year, a new entry-level Regency trim model was added. On upper level Regency Elite models, a PGA edition package was offered which included gold PGA emblems, gold nameplate badging, gold striping, and unique gold accent alloy wheels. In 1993, a new value priced Special Edition model was added to the lineup and Ninety-Eight received an improved 3.8 L V6 engine offering better performance and fuel efficiency.
For the 1994 model year, the Touring model was discontinued as the new, more dynamic Aurora rendered it superfluous. The similar, 88-based LSS remained in production from 1991 to 1999. Many features of the Touring, however, became standard or available on the Regency Elite including the supercharged engine. Additionally, the Ninety Eight added a standard front passenger-side airbag plus new instrument panel, steering wheel, and door panel designs. The exterior received a new cross-hatch grille as well as redesigned head- and side-marker lamps. In total, 8,960 Ninety Eight Tourings were built: 4,280 examples in 1991, 2,795 in 1992, and 1,885 in its final year.
In 1995, Oldsmobile further simplified the Ninety Eight lineup by offering just two levels of Regency Elite (Series I and Series II). Each was offered with a high level of standard equipment and only a short list of extra cost options. Also that year, the standard 3.8 L V6 engine was again reengineered to improve performance and fuel efficiency. For 1996, the Ninety Eight&#x27;s final year, changes were minimal. The most notable was the removal of the supercharged engine from the option list. That engine, however, remained available on Oldsmobile&#x27;s performance LSS model.

<doc id="540814" wikidata="Q1024044" url="?curid=540814" title="Leigh Bowery">
<text>Leigh Bowery (26 March 1961 – 31 December 1994) was an Australian performance artist, club promoter, and fashion designer. Bowery was known for his costumes, makeup and live performances considered as conceptual, flamboyant, outlandish, and sometimes controversial.

Based in London for much of his adult life, he was a significant model and muse for the English painter Lucian Freud. Bowery&#x27;s friend and fellow performer Boy George said he saw Bowery&#x27;s outrageous performances a number of times, and that it &quot;never ceased to impress or revolt.&quot;

== Early life and years in London ==
Bowery was born and raised in Sunshine, a suburb of Melbourne, Australia. From an early age, he studied music, played piano, and went on to study fashion and design at RMIT for a year. He moved to London in 1980, saying, &quot;I was so itchy to see new things and to see the world, that I just left.&quot; 

Bowery soon became part of the London club scene. He became an influential and lively figure in the underground clubs of London and New York, as well as in art and fashion circles. He attracted attention by wearing outlandish and creative outfits, which he made himself. He became friends and flatmates with artist Gary Barnes (known as &quot;Trojan&quot;) and David Walls. Bowery created costumes for them to wear, and the trio became known in the clubs as the &quot;Three Kings&quot;. Bowery often appeared in magazines and on television, including commercials for Pepe Jeans and Rifat Ozbek.

In 2005, the National Portrait Gallery of Australia acquired a portrait of Bowery in his fur coat by the photographer David Gwinnutt. In 2007, the National Portrait Gallery in London purchased Gwinnutt&#x27;s portrait of Bowery and Trojan (Barnes), which also appears in the Violette Editions book.

== Taboo club ==
Bowery was known as a club promoter, and created the club Taboo at Maximus in Leicester Square with promoter Tony Gordon in 1985. Taboo became &quot;the place to be&quot; with long queues. Drugs, particularly ecstasy, became a part of the dancing scene for the attendees. The club was known for defying sexual convention, for embracing &quot;polysexualism&quot;, for creating a wild atmosphere and for playing unexpected song selections. The DJs were Jeffrey Hinton, Rachel Auburn and Mark Lawrence. Regular guests included Boy George, George Michael, John Galliano, Judy Blame, Bodymap, Michael Clark, John Maybury, Cerith Wyn Evans. Taboo lasted 18 months and closed in 1986.

== Fashion and costume design ==
As a fashion designer, Bowery had several shows exhibiting his collections in London, New York and Tokyo. He influenced several designers and artists, and was known for wildly creative costumes, makeup, wigs and headgear, all of which combined to be striking and often kitschy. He also designed costumes for the Michael Clark Dance Company. When that company performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1987, Bowery won a Bessie Award for his work on &quot;No Fire Escape in Hell&quot;.

== Performance artist ==
As a performance artist, Bowery enjoyed creating the costumes, and often shocking audiences. Working alongside Michael Clark, he would often have solo scenes in many of Clark&#x27;s shows. 

His first one-man installation was in 1988 for a week at the Anthony D&#x27;Offay Gallery in London. Hidden behind a two way mirror he would lie on a 19th Century divan, primping and preening himself at his own reflection, while the audience would watch sitting on the floor from the other side. Each day he changed costumes and so visitors would often came back to see what he would be wearing next. Various traffic sounds would be played over the speaker system during the performance and there was a different smell every day, including bananas. 

In 1990 at the London club night &#x27;Kinky Gerlinky&#x27; he introduced his signature &#x27;Birthing&#x27; performance. Dressed as the drag performer Divine from &#x27;Female Trouble&#x27; he appeared on stage in an oversized t-shirt, dark glasses and headscarf, looking huge and miming along to the film dialogue. Then suddenly, much to the audience&#x27;s surprise, he drops onto his back and simulate &#x27;giving birth&#x27; to his baby, a petite and naked young woman who was his friend, assistant and later wife Nicola Bateman. She had been hidden for the first part of the performance by being strapped to Leigh&#x27;s belly with her face in his crotch. Then she would slip out of her harness and appear to pop out of Bowery&#x27;s belly, bursting through his tights, along with a lot of stage blood and links of sausages, while Bowery wailed. Bowery would then bite off the umbilical cord, hug his &#x27;new&#x27; baby and the two would take a bow. Boy George said he saw it a number of times, and that it &quot;never ceased to impress or revolt&quot;. 

In mid-1994 one of Bowery&#x27;s last performances took place at the Fort Asperen Art Festival in Holland, where he and his assistant Nicola and bass player Richard Torry performed to a bemused crowd during the day and fully naked, Richard covered in bright blue balloons. Bowery hangs upside down singing into the microphone while Richard pulls him back and forth by the foot until the climax of the song and Bowery smashes himself through a plane of glass, cutting his body. The whole performance lasts 5 minutes.

== Lucian Freud&#x27;s model ==
In London in 1988, Bowery met the noted painter Lucian Freud in his club Taboo. They were introduced by a mutual friend, the artist Cerith Wyn Evans. Freud had seen Bowery perform at Anthony d&#x27;Offay Gallery, in London. In Bowery&#x27;s first public appearance in the context of fine art, Bowery posed behind a one-way mirror in the gallery dressed in the flamboyant costumes he was known for.

Bowery used his body and manipulation of his flesh to create personas. This involved almost masochistically taping his torso and piercing his cheeks with pins in order to hold masks, as well as wearing outlandish makeup. Freud said, &quot;the way he edits his body is amazingly aware and amazingly abandoned&quot;. In return, Bowery said of Freud: &quot;I love the psychological aspect of his work – in fact, I sometimes felt as if I had been undergoing psychoanalysis with him ... His work is full of tension. Like me, he is interested in the underbelly of things&quot;. 

Bowery posed for a number of large full-length paintings that are considered among Freud&#x27;s best work. The paintings tend to exaggerate Bowery&#x27;s 6-foot 3-inch, 17-stone physique to monumental proportions. The paintings had a strong impact as part of Freud&#x27;s exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1994. Freud said he found him &quot;perfectly beautiful&quot;, and commented, &quot;His wonderfully buoyant bulk was an instrument I felt I could use, especially those extraordinary dancer&#x27;s legs&quot;. Freud noted that Leigh by nature was a shy and gentle man, and his flamboyant persona was in part a form of self-defence.

Jonathan Jones, writing for &quot;The Guardian,&quot; describes Freud&#x27;s portrait, &quot;Leigh Bowery (seated)&quot;:

== Minty ==

In 1993, Bowery formed the Romo/art-pop band Minty, with friend knitwear designer Richard Torry, Nicola Bateman, and Matthew Glamorre.

In November 1994, Minty began a two-week-long show at London&#x27;s Freedom Cafe, including audience member Alexander McQueen, but it was too much for Westminster City Council, who closed down the show after only one night. This was to be Bowery&#x27;s last performance. The show was documented by photographer A.M. Hanson with imagery subsequently published in books about Bowery and McQueen. 

Minty was a financial loss and represented a low point in Bowery&#x27;s colourful career. After his death, the band continued under the leadership of Bateman and Glammore up until the release of album &quot;Open Wide&quot;. This 1997 album was released on Candy Records and featured the singles &quot;Useless Man&quot;, &quot;Plastic Bag&quot;, &quot;Nothing&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s Nice&quot;. A spin-off band called The Offset later formed including artist Donald Urquhart.

In 2020, &quot;Open Wide&quot; was re-issued by Candy Records in association with The state51 Conspiracy, while &quot;Useless Man&quot; received a remix by Boy George and a new promo video directed by Torry and Glammore.

== Personal life ==
Although Bowery was openly gay, he married his long-time female companion Nicola Bateman on 13 May 1994 in Tower Hamlets, London, in &quot;a personal art performance&quot;. Although he had been HIV positive for six years, very few of those who knew him guessed that; he typically explained his public absence by saying he had gone to Papua New Guinea. 

His wife did not know that Bowery had HIV until he was admitted to hospital in late November 1994. He died seven months after their marriage, on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1994 (the date has been disputed by his father, who says he actually died in the early hours of New Year&#x27;s Day, 1995), from an AIDS-related illness at the Middlesex Hospital, Westminster, London, five weeks after his admission. Lucian Freud paid for Bowery&#x27;s body to be repatriated to Australia.

== &quot;Taboo&quot;, the musical ==
Boy George was the creative force, the lyricist and performer in the musical &quot;Taboo&quot;, which was loosely based on Bowery&#x27;s club. The musical was produced in 2002 on the West End in London, and then opened on Broadway. As a performer, Boy George played Bowery.

In an interview conducted by Mark Ronson for &quot;Interview Magazine&quot; Boy George said that Bowery would sometimes speak with a posh English accent, and one didn&#x27;t always know if he was sincere or mocking: He seemed to be &quot;in character&quot; at all times. Bowery decorated his flat in a style that was similar to the way he dressed, with &quot;Star Trek&quot;-themed wallpaper, mirrors and a large piano. He was a ringleader of misbehaviour, and with his club, he created a place where there were no rules. In the clubs at the peak of his fame, he would distort his body in various ways so that he would appear deformed, or pregnant or with breasts. Bowery once said, &quot;Flesh is my most favourite fabric&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
Bowery influenced other artists and designers including Meadham Kirchhoff, Alexander McQueen, Lucian Freud, Vivienne Westwood, Boy George, Antony and the Johnsons, Lady Gaga, John Galliano, Scissor Sisters, David LaChapelle, Lady Bunny, Acid Betty, Shea Couleé, and Charles Jeffrey plus numerous Nu-Rave bands and nightclubs in London and New York City.

Bowery was the main inspiration for the Tranimal drag movement, which emphasised an animalistic and post-modern take on drag.

Bowery was the subject of a small retrospective Art exhibition &#x27;Look At Me&#x27; at the RMIT Gallery at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia in February-March 1999, curated by Robert Buckingham and Rachel Young. This is the same institution Bowery briefly studied fashion at in the 1970s. 

Bowery was the subject of a retrospective Art exhibition &#x27;Take a Bowery: The Art and (larger Than) Life of Leigh Bowery&#x27; at the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia (MCA) in Sydney, Australia in December 2003-March 2004, curated by Artist, Art lecturer, curator and author Gary Carsley. 

Bowery is to be subject of a retrospective Art exhibition &#x27;Leigh Bowery!&#x27; at Tate Modern in London, England from February 2025-August 2025, curated by the Tate in collaboration with Nicola Rainbird (Nicola Bowery, nee Bateman), Director and Owner of the Estate of Leigh Bowery.

Bowery was the subject of a contemporary dance, physical theatre and circus show in August 2018 at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, put on by Australian choreographer Andy Howitt.

<text>The Western Malayo-Polynesian (WMP) languages, also known as the Hesperonesian languages, are a paraphyletic grouping of Austronesian languages that includes those Malayo-Polynesian languages that do not belong to the Central–Eastern Malayo-Polynesian (CEMP) branch. This includes all Austronesian languages spoken in Madagascar, Mainland Southeast Asia, the Philippines, the Greater Sunda Islands (including smaller neighboring islands), Bali, Lombok, the western half of Sumbawa, Palau and the Mariana Islands.

Western Malayo-Polynesian was originally proposed by Robert Blust as a sister branch within Malayo-Polynesian coordinate to the CEMP branch. Because there are no features that define the WMP languages positively as a subgroup, recent classifications have abandoned it.

<text>Wounded Knee Creek is a tributary of the White River, approximately 100 miles (160 km) long, in Oglala Lakota County, South Dakota in the United States. Its Lakota name is .

The creek&#x27;s name recalls an incident when a Native American sustained an injury to his knee during a fight.

The creek rises in the southwestern corner of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, along the state line with Nebraska, and flows northwest. It borders the site of the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre, in which United States Army troops from the 7th Cavalry Regiment massacred approximately 300 Lakota people, most of whom were unarmed women and children. Towns in this region include Wounded Knee and Manderson. The Wounded Knee Creek flows NNW across the reservation and joins the White south of Badlands National Park.

<text>Jacques Ferron (January 20, 1921 – April 22, 1985) was a Canadian physician and author.

Jacques Ferron was born in Louiseville, Quebec, the son of Joseph-Alphonse Ferron and Adrienne Caron. On March 5, 1931, his mother died. He attended Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf but was expelled in 1936. He continued his education at Collège Saint-Laurent and then was readmitted at Jean-de-Brébeuf, only to be expelled again. In September 1941, he was accepted at Université Laval where he studied medicine and on July 22, 1943, he married a fellow student, Madeleine Therrien, whom he divorced in 1949.

November 1943, he enrolled in the Canadian army as a medic and received the acceptance in June 1945. He trained in British Columbia and Ontario and after that was sent to Quebec and New Brunswick as a medic. When relieved of duty in 1946, he settled in Rivière-Madeleine, Quebec. His time in Gaspésie was the inspiration for many of his stories written later. He may have had to leave Rivière-Madeleine because he was denounced from the pulpit as a communist by the local parish priest. In 1947, his father died.

In 1948, he returned to Montréal. In 1949, he moved to Longueuil, Quebec and his first book, &quot;L&#x27;ogre&quot;, was published. He lived among working-class people that lived in Longueuil-annexe in those years, often offering his services for free-refusing to be paid, or omitting to ask. Not in the name of charity, but rather of solidarity- his giving was politically motivated, and he understood that his training as a doctor-his privilege- was paid for
by the misery that the francophone working class was experiencing at that time.

In 1951, he began a 30-year collaboration with &quot;L&#x27;Information médicale et paramédicale&quot;. On June 28, 1952, he married Madeleine Lavallée. In 1954 he became a member of the board of the Canadian Peace Congress. In 1959 he helped in the foundation of the magazine &quot;Situations&quot;. In 1960, with the help of Raoul Roy, he created l&#x27;Action socialiste pour l&#x27;indépendance du Québec.

In 1962, he received the Governor General&#x27;s Award for French fiction for his book &quot;Contes du pays incertain&quot;.

Ferron was a candidate for the CCF in the 1958 federal election in the Longueuil district. He finished third with 6.8% of the vote. In 1963 he founded the Parti Rhinocéros, which he described as &quot;an intellectual guerrilla party&quot;. He also began to write for the magazine &quot;Parti pris&quot;. He also ran for the RIN in the district of Taillon in the 1966 provincial election and outperformed other candidates of the same party, finishing third with a score of 18.3%. In 1969, he became a member of the Parti Québécois.

In 1977, the Quebec government awarded him the Prix Athanase-David. He was named an honorary member of the Union des écrivains québécois in 1981.

He died of a heart attack 1985 at his home in St-Lambert, Quebec, aged 64.

His life was dramatized by playwright Michèle Magny in her 2004 play &quot;Un carré de ciel&quot;.

<doc id="540838" wikidata="Q5361768" url="?curid=540838" title="Random field">
<text>In physics and mathematics, a random field is a random function over an arbitrary domain (usually a multi-dimensional space such as formula_1). That is, it is a function formula_2 that takes on a random value at each point formula_3(or some other domain). It is also sometimes thought of as a synonym for a stochastic process with some restriction on its index set. That is, by modern definitions, a random field is a generalization of a stochastic process where the underlying parameter need no longer be real or integer valued &quot;time&quot; but can instead take values that are multidimensional vectors or points on some manifold.

== Formal definition ==

Given a probability space formula_4, an &quot;X&quot;-valued random field is a collection of &quot;X&quot;-valued random variables indexed by elements in a topological space &quot;T&quot;. That is, a random field &quot;F&quot; is a collection
: formula_5
where each formula_6 is an &quot;X&quot;-valued random variable.

== Examples ==
In its discrete version, a random field is a list of random numbers whose indices are identified with a discrete set of points in a space (for example, n-dimensional Euclidean space). Suppose there are four random variables, formula_7, formula_8, formula_9, and formula_10, located in a 2D grid at (0,0), (0,2), (2,2), and (2,0), respectively. Suppose each random variable can take on the value of -1 or 1, and the probability of each random variable&#x27;s value depends on its immediately adjacent neighbours. This is a simple example of a discrete random field.

More generally, the values each formula_11 can take on might be defined over a continuous domain. In larger grids, it can also be useful to think of the random field as a &quot;function valued&quot; random variable as described above. In quantum field theory the notion is generalized to a random functional, one that takes on random values over a space of functions (see Feynman integral). 

Several kinds of random fields exist, among them the Markov random field (MRF), Gibbs random field, conditional random field (CRF), and Gaussian random field. In 1974, Julian Besag proposed an approximation method relying on the relation between MRFs and Gibbs RFs.

=== Example properties ===

An MRF exhibits the Markov property

: formula_12

for each choice of values formula_13. Here each formula_14 is the set of neighbors of formula_15. In other words, the probability that a random variable assumes a value depends on its immediate neighboring random variables. The probability of a random variable in an MRF is given by

:formula_16

where the sum (can be an integral) is over the possible values of k. It is sometimes difficult to compute this quantity exactly.

== Applications ==
When used in the natural sciences, values in a random field are often spatially correlated. For example, adjacent values (i.e. values with adjacent indices) do not differ as much as values that are further apart. This is an example of a covariance structure, many different types of which may be modeled in a random field. One example is the Ising model where sometimes nearest neighbor interactions are only included as a simplification to better understand the model.

A common use of random fields is in the generation of computer graphics, particularly those that mimic natural surfaces such as water and earth. Random fields have been also used in subsurface ground models as in 

In neuroscience, particularly in task-related functional brain imaging studies using PET or fMRI, statistical analysis of random fields are one common alternative to correction for multiple comparisons to find regions with &quot;truly&quot; significant activation. More generally, random fields can be used to correct for the look-elsewhere effect in statistical testing, where the domain is the parameter space being searched.

They are also used in machine learning applications (see graphical models).

== Tensor-valued random fields ==

Random fields are of great use in studying natural processes by the Monte Carlo method in which the random fields correspond to naturally spatially varying properties. This leads to tensor-valued random fields in which the key role is played by a statistical volume element (SVE), which is a spatial box over which properties can be averaged; when the SVE becomes sufficiently large, its properties become deterministic and one recovers the representative volume element (RVE) of deterministic continuum physics. The second type of random field that appears in continuum theories are those of dependent quantities (temperature, displacement, velocity, deformation, rotation, body and surface forces, stress, etc.).

<text>The Forty-eighters (48ers) were Europeans who participated in or supported the Revolutions of 1848 that swept Europe, particularly those who were expelled from or emigrated from their native land following those revolutions.

In the German Confederation, the Forty-eighters favoured unification of Germany, a more democratic government, and guarantees of human rights. Although many Americans felt very sympathetic to their cause and were saddened by their defeat, many Forty-Eighters were Freethinkers who were more influenced by post-1789 republicanism in France and the anti-religious ideas of The Enlightenment than the U.S. Constitution. In particular, their traditional hostility towards tolerating religious practice or Classical Christian education often put them at odds with American republicanism&#x27;s belief in freedom of religion and the independence of religious institutions from control by the State. Disappointed at their failure to permanently change the system of government in the German states or the Austrian Empire, and sometimes ordered by local governments to emigrate because of their involvement in the revolution, they gave up their old lives to live abroad. They emigrated to Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. They included Germans, Czechs, Hungarians, and Italians, among many others. A large number were respected, politically active, wealthy, and well-educated, and found success in their new countries.

==In the Americas==
===Brazil===

Disappointed by the failure of the Prussian Revolution in 1848, the biologist Fritz Müller realised there might be adverse effects on his life and career. As a result, he emigrated to South Brazil in 1852, with his brother August and their wives, to join Hermann Blumenau&#x27;s new colony in the State of Santa Catarina. There, he studied the natural history of the Atlantic forest in that region, and wrote the book Facts and Arguments for Darwin.

===Chile===

After being advised by Bernhard Eunom Philippi among others, Karl Anwandter emigrated to Chile following the failed revolution. In 1850 he settled in Valdivia. He was joined there by numerous other German immigrants of the period.

===United States===

Germans migrated to developing midwestern and southern cities, developing the beer and wine industries in several locations, and advancing journalism; others developed thriving agricultural communities.

Galveston, Texas, was a port of entry to many Forty-eighters. Some settled there and in Houston, but many went to the Texas Hill Country in the vicinity of Fredericksburg. Due to their liberal ideals, they strongly opposed Texas&#x27;s secession in 1861. In the Bellville area of Austin County, another destination for Forty-eighters, the German precincts voted decisively against the secession ordinance.

More than 30,000 Forty-eighters settled in what became called the Over-the-Rhine neighbourhood of Cincinnati, Ohio. There they helped define the distinct German culture of the neighbourhood, and in some cases also brought a rebellious nature with them from Germany. Cincinnati was the southern terminus of the Miami and Erie Canal, and large numbers of emigrants from modern Germany, beginning with the Forty-eighters, followed the canal north to settle available land in western Ohio.

In the Cincinnati riot of 1853, in which one demonstrator was killed, Forty-eighters violently protested the visit of the papal emissary Cardinal Gaetano Bedini, who had repressed revolutionaries in the Papal States in 1849. Protests took place also in 1854; Forty-eighters were held responsible for the killing of two law enforcement officers in the two events.

Many German Forty-eighters settled in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, helping solidify that city&#x27;s progressive political bent and cultural &quot;Deutschtum&quot;. The &quot;Acht-und-vierzigers&quot; and their descendants contributed to the development of that city&#x27;s long Socialist political tradition. Others settled throughout the state.

In the United States, most Forty-eighters opposed nativism and slavery, in keeping with the liberal ideals that had led them to flee from Europe. In the Camp Jackson Affair in St. Louis, Missouri, a large force of German volunteers helped prevent Confederate forces from seizing the government arsenal just prior to the beginning of the American Civil War. About 200,000 German-born soldiers enlisted in the Union Army, ultimately forming about 10% of the North&#x27;s entire armed forces; 13,000 Germans served in Union Volunteer Regiments from New York alone.

After the Civil War, Forty-eighters supported improved labor laws and working conditions. They also advanced the country&#x27;s cultural and intellectual development in such fields as education, the arts, medicine, journalism, and business.

Many were members of the Turner movement.

==In Australia==

In 1848, the first non-British ship carrying immigrants to arrive in Victoria was from Germany; the &quot;Goddefroy&quot;, on 13 February. Many of those on board were political refugees. Some Germans also travelled to Australia via London. In April 1849, the &quot;Beulah&quot; was the first ship to bring assisted German vinedresser families to New South Wales. The second ship, the &quot;Parland&quot;, left London on 13 March 1849, and arrived in Sydney on 5 July 1849.

The &quot;Princess Louise&quot; left Hamburg 26 March 1849, in the spring, bound for South Australia via Rio de Janeiro. The voyage took 135 days, which was considered slow, but nevertheless the &quot;Princess Louise&quot; berthed at Port Adelaide on 7 August 1849, with 161 emigres, including Johann Friedrich Mosel. Johann, born in 1827 in Berlin in the duchy of Brandenburg, had taken three weeks to travel from his home to the departure point of the 350-tonne vessel at Hamburg. This voyage had been well planned by two of the founding passengers, brothers Richard and Otto Schomburgk, who had been implicated in the revolution. Otto had been jailed in 1847 for his activities as a student revolutionary. The brothers, along with others including Frau Jeanne von Kreussler and Dr Carl Muecke, formed a migration group, the South Australian Colonisation Society, one of many similar groups forming throughout Germany at the time. Sponsored by geologist Leopold von Buch, the society chartered the &quot;Princess Louise&quot; to sail to South Australia. The passengers were mainly middle-class professionals, academics, musicians, artists, architects, engineers, artisans, and apprentices, and were among the core of liberal radicals, disillusioned with events in Germany.

Many Germans became vintners or worked in the wine industry; others founded Lutheran churches. By 1860, for example, about 70 German families lived in Germantown, Victoria. (When World War I broke out, the town was renamed Grovedale.) In Adelaide, a German Club was founded in 1854, which played a major role in society.

:Notable Australian Forty-eighters
*Carl Linger, the conductor and composer who wrote the tune for Caroline Carleton&#x27;s &quot;The Song of Australia&quot;
* Moritz Richard Schomburgk, later director of the Adelaide Botanical Gardens
*Hermann Büring, in the wine industry
*Friedrich Krichauff, chairman of the Agricultural Bureau

==In Europe==

===Belgium===
* Louis Blanc
* Victor Prosper Considerant

===France===
Ludwig Bamberger settled in Paris and worked in a bank from 1852 until the amnesty of 1866 allowed him to return to Germany. Carl Schurz was in France for a time before moving to England. He stayed there with Adolf Strodtmann. Anton Heinrich Springer visited France.

===Netherlands===
Ludwig Bamberger, Heinrich Bernhard Oppenheim and Anton Heinrich Springer all spent time in exile in the Netherlands.

===Portugal===

August Eduard Wilhelm Hector Achilles d&#x27;Orey (b. 1820, Wusterhausen/Dosse – d. unknown) was a participant in the Revolutions of 1848-49. After the revolutions failed, he fled to Portugal, where he settled and established himself as a merchant. Despite his relocation, he maintained close ties to his family in Germany, frequently returning to his homeland. His life, marked by political upheaval and cross-border connections, was highlighted in a 2018 exhibition at the Wegemuseum in Wusterhausen.

===Switzerland===
The following were all refugees from Germany:
* Friedrich Beust settled in Switzerland to work in early-childhood education. He lived and worked there until his death in 1899.
* Albert Dulk, a dramatist, settled in Geneva after touring the Orient. He eventually returned to Germany.
* Gottfried Kinkel moved to Switzerland in 1866 after living in England. He was a professor of archaeology and the history of art at the Polytechnikum in Zürich, where he died 16 years later.
* Hermann Köchly first fled to Brussels in 1849. In 1851, he was appointed professor of classical philology at the University of Zürich. By 1864, he was back in Germany as a professor at the University of Heidelberg.
* Johannes Scherr, novelist and literary critic, fled to Switzerland and eventually became a professor at the Polytechnikum in Zurich.
* Richard Wagner, the composer, first fled to Paris and then settled in Zurich. He eventually returned to Germany.

===United Kingdom===

In the early years after the failure of the revolutions of 1848, a group of German Forty-eighters and others met in a salon organized by Baroness Méry von Bruiningk and her husband Ludolf August von Bruiningk in St. John&#x27;s Wood, then a suburb of London. The baroness was a Russian of German descent who was sympathetic with the goals of the revolutionaries. Guests included Carl Schurz, Gottfried and Johanna Kinkel, Ferdinand Freiligrath, Alexander Herzen, Louis Blanc, Malwida von Meysenbug, Adolf Strodtmann, Johannes and Bertha Ronge, Alexander Schimmelfennig, Wilhelm Loewe-Kalbe and Heinrich Bernhard Oppenheim.

Carl Schurz wrote in his memoir about this time: 
&quot;A large number of refugees from almost all parts of the European continent had gathered in London since the year 1848, but the intercourse between the different national groups – Germans, Frenchmen, Italians, Hungarians, Poles, Russians – was confined more or less to the prominent personages. All, however, in common nourished the confident hope of a revolutionary upturning on the continent soon to come. Among the Germans there were only a few who shared this hope in a less degree. Perhaps the ablest and most important person among these was Lothar Bucher, a quiet, retiring man of great capacity and acquirements, who occupied himself with serious political studies.&quot;

Other Germans who fled to the United Kingdom for a time were Ludwig Bamberger,
Arnold Ruge, Alexandre Ledru-Rollin and Franz Sigel. Along with several of the above, Sabine Freitag also lists Gustav Adolf Techow, Eduard Meyen, Graf Oskar von Reichenbach, Josef Fickler and Amand Goegg. Karl Blind became a writer in Great Britain. Bohemian Anton Heinrich Springer was in England for a time during his years of exile.

Hungarian refugee Gustav Zerffi became a British citizen and worked as a historian in London. Lajos Kossuth, a Hungarian revolutionary, toured England &amp; Scotland and then the United States. He returned to Great Britain, where he formed a government in exile.

French refugees Louis Blanc, Pierre Leroux, and Louis-Nicolas Ménard found relief in Great Britain for a time.

Italian Giuseppe Mazzini used London as a place of refuge before and after the revolutions of 1848.

:Heligoland
In addition, the British possession of Heligoland was a destination for refugees, for example Rudolf Dulon.

:Jersey
* Pierre Leroux

==Wandering Forty-eighters==
*Karl Hermann Berendt, a German physician, emigrated to the United States and spent his time there and in Mesoamerica investigating Mayan linguistics.
*Ferenc Pulszky, a Hungarian politician, who joined Kossuth on his tour of England and the United States, became involved in Italian revolutionary activities and was imprisoned, and then was pardoned and returned home in 1866.

<text>The Battle of Richmond, Kentucky, fought August 29–30, 1862, was one of the most complete Confederate victories in the American Civil War by Major General Edmund Kirby Smith against Union major general William &quot;Bull&quot; Nelson&#x27;s forces, which were defending the town. It was the first major battle in the Kentucky Campaign. The battle took place on and around what is now the grounds of the Blue Grass Army Depot, outside Richmond, Kentucky.

==Background==
In the summer of 1862, two Confederate armies moved on separate paths into Kentucky, hoping to put back into power the shadow Confederate government of Kentucky which had lost control over most of the state in early 1862, threaten Union cities along the Ohio River, and recruit men to join the Confederate Army. First to move was Smith, leading the Confederate Army of Kentucky, whose ideas provided the initiative for the offensive. General Braxton Bragg, commanding the Army of Mississippi, moved on a roughly parallel track to the west. Smith departed Knoxville on August 13, and Bragg left Chattanooga on August 27.

==Opposing forces==
===Union===
===Confederate===
==Battle==
Brigadier General Patrick Cleburne led Smith&#x27;s advance, with Colonel John S. Scott&#x27;s cavalry out in front. The Confederate cavalry, while moving north from Big Hill on the road to Richmond, Kentucky on August 29, encountered Union troopers and began skirmishing. After noon, Union artillery and infantry joined the fray, forcing the Confederate cavalry to retreat to Big Hill.

At that time, Brigadier General Mahlon D. Manson, who commanded Union forces in the area, commanded a brigade to march to Rogersville, Kentucky towards the rebels. Fighting for the day stopped after pursuing Union forces briefly skirmished with Cleburne&#x27;s men in the late afternoon. That night, Manson informed his superior, Bull Nelson, of his situation, and he ordered another brigade to be ready to march in support when required. Manson arrayed his four regiments to the south of Mt Zion church and had them prepare for an attack. 

Smith ordered Cleburne to attack in the morning and promised to hurry reinforcements (Brigadier General Thomas J. Churchill&#x27;s division). Cleburne started early, marching north, passed through Kingston, dispersed Union skirmishers, and approached Manson&#x27;s battle line near Zion Church. As the day progressed, additional troops joined both sides. Following an artillery duel, the battle began, and Mason reinforced the Union left flank which he thought was weakening. But Churchill&#x27;s troops used a hidden ravine to come up on his right, and after a concerted Confederate attack on the Union right, the Union troops gave way. Retreating into Rogersville, they made another futile stand at their old bivouac.

By now, Smith and Nelson had arrived and taken command of their respective armies. Nelson rallied some troops in the cemetery outside Richmond, but they were routed.

==Aftermath==
Nelson and some of his men escaped, but the Confederates captured over 4,300 Union troops. Total casualties were 5,353 (206 killed, 844 wounded, and 4,303 captured or missing) on the Union side, and 451 (78 killed, 372 wounded, and one missing) for the Confederates. The way north towards Lexington and Frankfort was open.

Civil War historian Shelby Foote remarked that Smith &quot;accomplished in Kentucky the nearest thing to a Cannae ever scored by any general, North or South, in the course of the whole war.&quot;

==Battlefield preservation==

The American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved 365 acres of the Richmond Battlefield as of mid-2023.

The Mt. Zion Christian Church, which served as a hospital during the battle and has cannonballs embedded in its brick walls, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Two discontinuous areas totalling were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Battle of Richmond Historic Areas in 1996. These included four contributing buildings.

<doc id="540846" wikidata="Q118873" url="?curid=540846" title="Peru–Chile Trench">
<text>The Peru–Chile Trench, also known as the Atacama Trench, is an oceanic trench in the eastern Pacific Ocean, about off the coast of Peru and Chile. It reaches a maximum depth of below sea level in Richards Deep () and is approximately long; its mean width is and it covers an expanse of some .

The trench delineates the boundary between the subducting Nazca plate and the overriding South American plate.

==Geology==
The trench is a result of a convergent plate boundary, where the eastern edge of the oceanic Nazca plate is being subducted beneath the continental South American plate. The trench is also a part of the Chile triple junction, an unusual junction that consists of a mid-oceanic ridge and the Chile Rise being subducted under the South American plate at the Peru–Chile Trench. Two seamount ridges within the Nazca plate enter the subduction zone along this trench: the Nazca Ridge and the Juan Fernández Ridge.

From the Chile triple junction to Juan Fernández Ridge the trench is filled with of sediments, creating a flat bottom topography. Sediments are mainly turbidites interspersed with oceanic deposits of clay, volcanic ash, and siliceous ooze.

The Peru–Chile Trench, the forearc and the western edge of the central Andean plateau (Altiplano), delineate the dramatic &quot;Bolivian Orocline&quot; that defines the Andean slope of southern Peru, northern Chile, and Bolivia.

==Oceanography==
Most of the time, the trade winds drive surface waters offshore near the equator, driving the Humboldt Current from the tip of southern Chile to northern Peru. This current is associated with upwelling of deep, nutrient-rich water off the coast of Peru. At times, El Niño disrupts the usual wind pattern and lessens the upwelling. The consequent loss of nutrient causes fish kills.

== Biology ==
In 2018, three new species of snailfish were discovered thriving in the depths of the Atacama Trench.

In 2023, a predatory crustacean was discovered in the Atacama Trench.

==Associated seismicity==
The subduction of the Nazca plate below the South American plate along the Chile-Peru Trench is associated with numerous earthquakes. Several of these earthquakes are notable for their size, associated tsunamis, and landslides.
*1570 Concepcion earthquake: Mw ~8.3
*1687 Peru earthquake: Mw ~8.7
*1730 Valparaíso earthquake Ms ~8.7
*1746 Lima–Callao earthquake: Mw ~8.7
*1868 Arica earthquake: Mw ~9.0
*1877 Offshore Tarapaca, Peru: Mw ~8.3
*1906 Valparaíso earthquake
*1942 Peru earthquake: Mw 8.2 event associated with a tsunami, the rupture dimensions and epicenter are similar to those of a 1996 earthquake
*1960 Valdivia earthquake: At Mw 9.5, the largest earthquake ever recorded on the earth
*November 1960 Peru earthquake: This event had a long source duration, leading to a significant discrepancy between different moment calculation methods ( 6.75 vs 7.8) 
*1970 Ancash earthquake: This Mw7.9 event triggered a landslide with large snow and ice components, killing ~68,000 people
*2001 southern Peru earthquake: Mw 8.4
*2005 Tarapacá earthquake
*2007 Tocopilla earthquake
*2007 Peru earthquake: Mw 8.0
*2010 Chile earthquake: Mw 8.8 event associated with a tsunami

<text>The Oldsmobile 88 (marketed from 1989 on as the Eighty Eight) is a full-size car that was sold and produced by Oldsmobile from 1949 until 1999. From 1950 until 1974, the 88 was the division&#x27;s most profitable line, particularly the entry-level models such as the 88 and Dynamic 88. The 88 series was also an image leader for Oldsmobile, particularly in the early years (1949–51), when it was one of the best-performing automobiles, thanks to its relatively small size, light weight, and advanced overhead-valve high-compression V8 engine. This engine, originally designed for the larger C-bodied and more luxurious 98 series, also replaced the straight-8 on the smaller B-bodied 78. With the large, high performance V8, the Oldsmobile 88 is considered by some to be the first muscle car, although this title is disputed.

Naming conventions used by GM since the 1910s for all divisions used alphanumeric designations that changed every year. Starting after the war, Oldsmobile changed their designations and standardized them so that the first number signified the chassis platform, while the second number signified how many cylinders. A large number of variations in nomenclature were seen over this long model run — Super, Golden Rocket, Dynamic, Jetstar, Delta, Delmont, Starfire, Holiday, LS, LSS, Celebrity, and Royale were used at various times with the 88 badge, and Fiesta appeared on some station wagons in the 1950s and 1960s. The name was more commonly shown as numerals in the earlier years (&quot;Delta 88&quot;, for example) and was changed to spell out &quot;Eighty Eight&quot; starting in 1989.

==First generation (1949–1953)==



Oldsmobile introduced the 88 badge in 1949. It was named to complement the already-existing 76 and 98, and took the place of the straight-8 engined 78 in the model lineup. The new car used the same new A-body platform as the straight-6 engined 76 but paired it with the new Rocket V8 engine producing . This combination of a relatively small light body and large, powerful engine made it widely considered to be the first muscle car. The Rocket 88 vaulted Oldsmobile from a somewhat staid, conservative car to a performer that became the one to beat on the NASCAR (National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing) circuits. 

It won six of the nine NASCAR late-model division races in 1949, 10 of 19 in 1950, 20 of 41 in 1952, and was eventually eclipsed by the low-slung, powerful Hudson Hornet, but it was still the first real &quot;King of NASCAR.&quot; This led to increased sales to the public. There was a pent up demand for new cars in the fast-expanding post-World War II economy, and the 88 appealed to many ex-military personnel who were young and had operated powerful military equipment.

The 88 enjoyed great success, inspiring a popular 1950s slogan, &quot;Make a Date with a Rocket 88&quot;, and also a song, &quot;Rocket 88&quot;, often considered the first rock and roll record. Starting with the trunk-lid emblem of the 1950 model, Oldsmobile would adopt the rocket as its logo, and the 88 name would remain in the Olds lineup until the late 1990s, almost until the end of Oldsmobile itself.

The 1949 model was equipped with an ignition key and a starter push-button to engage the starter. Pushing the starter button would engage the starter, but if the ignition key was not inserted, unlocking the ignition, the car would not start. The car was equipped with an oil bath air cleaner. At the bottom edge of the front fender directly behind the front wheel was a badge that said &quot;Futuramic&quot; which identified an Oldsmobile approach to simplified driving, and the presence of an automatic transmission. V8 Oldsmobiles were automatic-only in 1949 as Oldsmobile lacked a manual gearbox that could handle the torque of the new engine.1948 Oldsmobile Futuramic introduction In 1950, Oldsmobile offered a modified Cadillac manual gearbox for V8 models. The 88 now outsold the six-cylinder 76 lineup, which was dropped entirely after the 1950 model year. It had a 40 ft. turning circle. Hershel McGriff and Ray Elliot with the 1950 model won the 1950 Carrera Panamericana.

For 1951, the 88 became the entry-level Olds with the discontinuation of the six-cylinder 76 line, which meant that all Oldsmobiles were powered by Rocket V8s. An in-house manual transmission replaced the modified Cadillac gearbox, but as the 1950s progressed, manual shift became increasingly rare in Oldsmobiles and normally could only be obtained by special order. New this year was the more upscale Super 88 line on the new GM B-body which included restyled rear body panels, a more luxurious interior, and a slightly longer wheelbase as opposed to the wheelbase which had been standard since the 88&#x27;s introduction. The station wagon was discontinued and would not reappear until the 1957 model year. New was an I-beam frame. Hydraulic power windows and seats were optional.

In 1952, the base 88 shared the Super 88&#x27;s rear body panels and wheelbase, and came with a Rocket V8 and two-barrel carburetor while Super 88s came with a new four-barrel carburetor upping the output to . Other mechanical features were unchanged with styling changes amounting to new grilles, taillights, and interior revisions. New was the optional automatic headlight control.For 1953, the base 88 was renamed the DeLuxe 88 for only this one year while the Super 88 continued as a more upscale version. Engines and transmission offerings were the same as 1952. Late in the 1953 model year, a fire destroyed GM&#x27;s Hydra-Matic plant in Livonia, Michigan, which was then the only source for Hydra-Matic transmissions. The temporary loss of Hydra-Matic production led Oldsmobile to build thousands of its 1953 models with Buick&#x27;s two-speed Dynaflow automatic transmissions until GM pressed its Willow Run Transmission plant into service to resume Hydra-Matic production. New options this year included Frigidaire air conditioning, power steering, and power brakes.
==Second generation (1954–1956)==
===1954===
The 1954 Oldsmobiles were completely restyled with new longer and lower body shells on the GM B platform with new one piece wrap-around windshields and rear windows. Wheelbases increased to . Base models reverted to being simply called 88s after being designated as DeLuxe 88s for only one year and the Super 88 was once again the top series (beneath the larger 98). The Rocket V8 was enlarged from 303 to 324 cubic inches with 88s powered by a two-barrel, unit while Super 88s came with a version with four-barrel carburetor. Also, a safety-padded dash became optional, at $17 ($ in dollars ).
===1955===
The 1955 models were heavily facelifted with new grillework, taillights and body-side chrome. Horsepower for the 324-cubic-inch Rocket V8 increased to 185 for 88s and 202 for Super 88s. At mid-year, Olds introduced the new pillarless four-door hardtop body, dubbed the Holiday sedan, in both the 88 and Super 88 series. The four-door Oldsmobile 88 Holiday, along with the four-door 98 Holiday, Buick Century Riviera, and Special Riviera, were the first four-door hardtops ever produced. Air conditioning became an option. The 88 had full instrumentation. The term &quot;Morocceen&quot; began to be used to describe the vinyl interior which was used for several decades.

===1956===
For 1956, styling highlights included a new split grille in front and revised taillights and deck along with revised side chroming. Horsepower for the 324 Rocket V8 increased to 230 for 88s and 240 for Super 88s. A new four-speed Jetaway Hydra-Matic was introduced this year to replace the original Hydra-Matic transmission that Olds had used since 1940. The new Jetaway Hydra-Matic retained the four forward speeds and fluid coupling unit, but added a new &quot;Park&quot; position to the shift quadrant and no longer required band adjustment as a specified routine maintenance. Inside, an oval speedometer replaced the round unit and a new foot-operated parking brake replaced the previous T-handle unit.
==Third generation (1957–1958)==
===1957===
For 1957 only, the basic 88 was officially named Golden Rocket 88, taken from Oldsmobile&#x27;s 1956 Motorama two-passenger show car. However, the only badging was an &quot;88&quot; underneath each taillight. Also for 1957 the &quot;J2&quot; option was offered, with three two-barrel carburetors, similar to the Pontiac Tri-Power. The Super 88 continued as the upscale mid-line series. Under the hood, the Rocket V8 increased in displacement to 371 cubic inches and for all models across the board. Although rare, three speed manual transmissions were still available. Styling highlights were more evolutionary than radical, with a three-piece rear window design marketed as the “Twin-Strut Rear Window.” This was a feature in all series fixed-roof body-styles except station wagons. Buick also used this 3-piece rear window design that year, but without any marketing nickname. Oldsmobile revived station wagons for the first time since 1950 with the Super 88 Fiesta being a four-door hardtop design. In 1957, Oldsmobile added a safety deep-recessed steering wheel.



===1958===
For 1958, GM was promoting their fiftieth year of production, and introduced Anniversary models for each brand; Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Chevrolet. 

The 1958 model is best known in Oldsmobile as the year of the &quot;ChromeMobile&quot; thanks to tremendous splatterings of chrome trim on the body, particularly on the higher-priced Super 88 and Ninety-Eight models. The styling was advertised by Olds as the &quot;Mobile Look.&quot; The Dynamic 88 debuted in 1958 and lasted through 1966 positioned as the entry-level model below the Super 88. This model featured a more economical Rocket V8 than its more expensive linemates – a de-tuned version of the 371 cubic-inch Rocket V8 with two-barrel carburation. Super 88 models were powered by a four-barrel version of that engine as standard equipment with a J-2 option featuring three two-barrel carburetors and .
A new option for 1958 was a &quot;Trans-Portable&quot; radio that could be removed from the instrument panel through the glove compartment and used as a portable radio for beaches, picnics, etc. thanks to portable batteries.
A revised instrument panel was highlighted by a new deep-dish steering wheel with &quot;horn bars&quot; replacing the long-standing horn ring still common during that period.

Despite an economic recession that cut into new car sales industry wide, and especially affected the medium-priced car market that Olds competed in, Oldsmobile saw only a slight decline in sales for 1958 and even rose in industry standings to fourth-place behind the &quot;Low-Priced Three&quot; of Chevrolet, Ford and Plymouth, while surpassing a now-floundering sister division Buick on the sales charts for the first time in many years. Oldsmobile was also way ahead of other middle-priced competitors such as sister division Pontiac, Mercury, Dodge and Chrysler, along with Ford Motor Company&#x27;s all-new and ill-fated Edsel, and Chrysler Corporation&#x27;s DeSoto - the latter two nameplates of which would fade into oblivion within the next three years.
==Fourth generation (1959–1960)==
===1959===

All Oldsmobiles were completely restyled for 1959, with the 88 series given longer, lower and wider styling on a GM B-body chassis. The 88 shared its appearance with the top-model Oldsmobile 98. Styling highlights for the new models, promoted as the &quot;Linear Look,&quot; included six-window styling on four-door pillared sedans, glassy semi-fastback rooflines on Holiday coupes and flat-blade rooflines with thin windshield and C-pillars on Holiday sedans which created a large open greenhouse effect. Two-door hardtops were called &quot;Holiday Scenicoupes,&quot; whereas four-door hardtops were called &quot;Holiday Sport Sedans.&quot; While many 1959 model cars featured bigger and sharper fins, Olds flattened theirs horizontally and reduced chrome from 1958 for a much cleaner look. Wheelbases on 88 models increased by one inch to .

A larger, 394 cubic-inch Rocket V8 with four-barrel carburation rated at was standard on the Super 88. The lower-priced Dynamic 88 retained the two-barrel 371 cubic-inch &#x27;57–58 Rocket V8, with a four-barrel version optional. An unusual feature was the what was called the &quot;Safety-Spectrum Speedometer&quot;, in which the bar that is used the measure the speed is green from , amber at , and red at speeds above .

===1960===

A simpler but bold new grille and revised rear design with even flatter, horizontal tailfins and new taillights highlighted the 1960 makeover. Power for Super 88 models remained the same, while Dynamic 88s had their 371 ci Rocket V8 detuned to , where a lower compression ratio accommodated lower-priced regular gasoline. Other changes included a revised instrument panel and a slimmer transmission tunnel for improved interior space.
==Fifth generation (1961–1964)==
===1961===
An all-new body and chassis with perimeter &quot;Guard Beam&quot; frame and all-coil suspension replacing the previous leaf springs highlighted the 1961 full-sized Oldsmobiles, which were joined by the new compact F-85. All full-sized Oldsmobiles were now powered by the 394-cubic-inch Rocket V8 with the Dynamic 88 getting a two-barrel, version that used regular gas, while the Super 88 was powered by a four-barrel &quot;Ultra High Compression&quot; 394 Skyrocket V8 rated at . The Skyrocket engine was available as an extra-cost option on the Dynamic 88. A new three-speed &quot;Roto&quot; Hydra-matic transmission that was smaller and lighter than the previous four-speed unit was introduced as an option.
The 1961 Oldsmobile body design represented the after-effect of the 1958 recession. While wheelbases remained the same as in 1960, the overall length and width were reduced slightly – a trend seen throughout all of GM&#x27;s marques. Body design focused on a trimmer, fuselage design. At the bottom of the rear quarters, a &quot;skeg&quot;—a downward fin—jutted outboard to counterbalance the rearward point of the quarter panel, an appearance shared with the 1959 Pontiac Bonneville. Round tail lights, one on each side, were set into the rear cove. For 1961, GM retired the compound curve windshields that it introduced in 1954, and the much hated body dogleg necessitated by the shape of the windshield. Instead of adopting the cleaner straight angled &quot;A&quot; pillar, Harley Earl, who was nearing the end of his tenure at GM, pushed for a small curved switch back, used in 1961–62, at the outboard base of the windshield.

Like for the previous model year, there were six body styles: a 2-door sedan, the Celebrity Sedan 4-door sedan, the Holiday Sedan 4-door hardtop, the Holiday Coupe 2-door hardtop, the Convertible Coupe drop-top and the Fiesta station wagon, available in both 2- and 3-seat models. All body styles but the 2-door sedan (which was the price leader) were offered both as Dynamic 88 and Super 88. In general all models had thicker pillars than the extremely thin ones found on previous generation models. The Holiday Coupe 2-door hardtop continued the &quot;bubble top&quot; look. The 1961 Holiday Sedan 4-door hardtop had thicker, parallelogram-shaped rear pillar than its predecessor. The extreme &quot;floating roof&quot; look of the 1959–1960 4-door hardtop, with wrap-around panoramic rear window and overhanging roof, had been passed on to the pillared Celebrity Sedan—which had switched from the previous year six-window to a four-window greenhouse. Six-window sedans continued to be offered in the 98 line.

At mid-year, a sporty and luxurious convertible called the Oldsmobile Starfire was introduced. It was based on the Super 88 ragtop and featured leather bucket seats, center console with floor shifter for the Hydra-matic transmission (incidentally the first U.S. full-sized production car to feature an automatic transmission with a console-mounted floor shifter) and many other standard items such as power steering, brakes, windows and driver&#x27;s seat. The Starfire was also powered by an even higher-performance version of the &quot;Ultra High Compression&quot; 394-cubic-inch Starfire V8 rated at .

===1962===

For 1962, the Oldsmobile 88 received a &quot;second-year&quot; facelift that included a revised grille and front bumper. Length was increased somewhat to give the &#x27;62 Olds a longer look. Changes to the rear included the removal of the rear fender skegs (personally ordered by GM&#x27;s Vice President of design Bill Mitchell, who disliked them), and oval taillights, one on each side for Dynamic and Super 88 models replaced the 1961&#x27;s round units. 1962 Starfires received two oval lights per side, much like the concurrent Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight models. Changes to the greenhouse included new roof lines for the four-door Celebrity Sedan—which relinquished the panoramic rear window—and for the Holiday Coupe two-door hardtop, which received a new fashionable convertible-inspired roofline abandoning the &quot;bubble-top&quot; appearance. The two-door sedan, made redundant as entry-level model by the previous year&#x27;s introduction of the F-85 compact, was discontinued. Lastly, the Fiesta station wagon was only partially restyled, retaining most of the 1961&#x27;s rear styling; the 3-seat wagon was now only available as Dynamic 88.

Engines were uprated to for the standard engine in the Dynamic 88 thanks to a higher compression ratio that demanded the use of premium fuel (a regular-fuel version was offered as a no-cost option), 330 horses for the &quot;Skyrocket&quot; V8 standard on Super 88 and Ninety-Eight and 345 horsepower for the top Starfire Rocket V8. Oldsmobile marketing continued to use the trade names of &quot;Roto-matic Power Steering&quot; and &quot;Pedal-eeze Power Brakes&quot;.
All Oldsmobiles featured the &quot;speed bar&quot; speedometer. Introduced in 1959, the speedometer used a rolling black cylinder with sections painted brilliant green, yellow and bright red. As the car went from a standing stop forward in speed, the cylinder rolled, first exposing the green in a window that matched the numeric speed on stationary speed dial for low speeds, yellow at moderate speeds, and finally red at highway speeds. Drivers who topped the car over 100 mph moved the cylinder into an area where only the black base color was visible. For 1963, Oldsmobile would revert to a standard speed needle sweeping over a calibrated set of speeds instead.

1962 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88s and Dynamic 88 Fiesta wagons each had their own upholstery patterns in single and dual-tone colors. Super 88s received tri-tone upholstery and trim. Heaters became standard equipment on all models, and the push-button controls were located to the right of the steering wheel column. Vehicles not equipped with air conditioning received push-button vacuum-operated fresh air vents, called &quot;Summer Ventilation&quot;, which replaced the pull level type vents. This control panel was located on the left of the steering column. Cars equipped with factory air conditioning replaced the vent control panel with the air conditioning panel, which also contained its own blower switch. These cars also sported round dash vents for the delivery of A/C airflow. Dynamic 88s received aqua dashboard panel inserts with &quot;OLDSMOBILE&quot; lettering, while Super 88s received panels with that model&#x27;s nomenclature on the insert.

===1963===

All full-sized Oldsmobiles underwent extensive body and trim revisions for 1963. Most of the underlying basic body structure and rooflines were carried over from &#x27;62 with new exterior sheet metal abandoning the previous years&#x27; sculpted mid-sections; Lincoln Continental-style slab sides and sharper edges being employed overall. The Starfire gained an exclusive razor-edged roof treatment utilizing a concave backlight similar to that of the new Pontiac Grand Prix. Different rear quarter panels meant Oldsmobile 88s and the more expensive 98s were more differentiated than before. 1963 also brought about GM&#x27;s across-the-board adoption of the straight angled windshield &quot;A&quot; pillar on all full-size production vehicles eliminating the unusual 1961 through 1962 reverse-curve treatment. Models and drivetrains in both the Dynamic 88 and Super 88 series were unchanged from 1962. Options that year included a &quot;tilt-away&quot; steering wheel that could be adjusted to six positions, six-way power seats, AM/FM radio and cruise control.

===1964===

The sharp-edged theme continued for 1964, Oldsmobile&#x27;s full-sized cars received a minor face-lift that included revised trim, grilles and taillights. New that year was the introduction of price leader for the full-sized Oldsmobile series, the Jetstar 88, which used the same full-size body as other 88 models but also shared key components with that year&#x27;s redesigned F-85 intermediate. The Jetstar 88 used the smaller 330 V8 and Jetaway (Super Turbine 300) two-speed automatic transmission in place of the 394-cubic-inch V8 and Roto Hydramatic found in other Oldsmobiles, and 9.5-inch (241.3 mm) drum brakes which were less effective than the drums found on other full-sized Olds models.

Oldsmobile also introduced the Jetstar I for 1964. Not part of the Jetstar 88 line, the Jetstar I instead was a direct competitor to the Pontiac Grand Prix in the same $3,500 price range. Jetstar I models shared the notchback body style with the Starfire along with its more powerful 394-cubic-inch Rocket V8 engine, but with less standard equipment and a lower price tag. Oddly, Oldsmobile teamed the Rocket engine with a very unsuitable transmission in the Jetstar I, the Jetaway (Super Turbine 300) two-speed unit with &quot;switch pitch&quot; converter.

With the introduction of the Jetstar 88, the Dynamic 88 models were elevated a rung up the ladder for the 1964 model year. Only the Dynamic 88s could be in five body styles: four-door pillared Celebrity Sedan and hardtop Holiday Sedan, two-door hardtop Holiday Coupe, convertible and 2- or 3-seat Fiesta station wagon. The Jetstar 88 was not offered as a station wagon.

1964 was the last for the Super 88 series, which was limited to the two four-door body styles—the Celebrity Sedan and Holiday Sedan. Total production for both four-door Super 88 models reached 19,514 assemblies for the model year.
1964 was also the last year for Oldsmobile to offer full-sized station wagons until the 1971 model year. Oldsmobile&#x27;s full-size Fiesta wagons (and Buick&#x27;s Estate Wagons) introduced in 1957 had never been strong sellers. From 1960 to 1963, production per model (Super or Dynamic) and seating capacity (six or nine passenger) never broke 15,000 units. The wagons&#x27; bodies weren&#x27;t made by Fisher Body, but were instead farmed out to Ionia Manufacturing Company of Ionia, Michigan. As Oldsmobile set its sights on more luxury and performance, full-sized wagons weren&#x27;t in the mix. The division introduced the new Vista Cruiser wagon in mid-1964 that featured a raised roofline and skylights over the rear seat and cargo area. The models were offered with six- or nine-passenger seating with all seats facing forward. The Vista Cruiser used a six-inch (152 mm) stretched wheelbase version of the intermediate F-85/Cutlass. This allowed Oldsmobile (and Buick, which used the same body and stretch wheelbase for its Sport Wagon) to offer a wagon comparable in overall size to the full-sized Chevrolet Impala and Pontiac Catalina wagons, but without diluting the cachet of its full-size cars with a utilitarian body style.

== Sixth generation (1965–1970)==
===1965===
The Delta name in 1965 was an upscale trim line of the Dynamic 88, the Dynamic 88 Delta, replacing the previous top-series B-body Olds, the Super 88. Early &#x27;65s were referred to as Dynamic 88 Deltas, but within a few weeks after the start of the model year, Olds began marketing the line as a separate series known as the Delta 88. Other full-sized Oldsmobile model lines included the low-priced Jetstar 88, the volume-selling Dynamic 88, sporty Jetstar I and the sporty and luxurious Starfire, all riding on a wheelbase. Oldsmobile had some marketing successes naming the Starfire after a United States Air Force fighter Lockheed F-94 Starfire and tried the approach again, naming the Delta 88 after the Convair F-102 Delta Dagger.

All 1965 Olds models featured all new styling and engineering. The B-body cars featured more rounded styling than previous years with Coke-bottle profiles and semi-fastback rooflines on Holiday (two-door hardtop) coupes - Jetstar I and Starfire coupes got a more rounded variation of the squared-off 1963–64 roofline with concave rear window shared by Pontiac&#x27;s Grand Prix.
Also introduced this year was a new 425 cubic-inch Super Rocket V8 with horsepower ratings ranging from 300 to 370 depending on carburation and compression ratio. The new three-speed Turbo Hydramatic transmission with torque converter replaced the Roto Hydramatic used since 1961. Also new to the option list for 1965 on all B-body cars was a four-speed manual transmission with Hurst floor shifter, which was a seldom-ordered offering.

===1966===

Few styling changes other than revised grilles and tail sections marked the 1966 full-sized Oldsmobiles. The sporty Jetstar I series was dropped with a lower-priced Starfire only offered as a hardtop coupe taking its place. All other series&#x27; 88 models were carried over from 1965 with a new convertible added to the Delta 88 line and the same bodystyle dropped from the Jetstar 88 line.

A new option for all senior Oldsmobiles (88, Ninety-Eight and the new front-drive Toronado) was GM&#x27;s automatic Comfortron Air Conditioning system first introduced by Cadillac in 1964. Comfortron permitted the driver to automatically set a year-round temperature at a constant level. The basic Frigidaire air conditioning unit offered in previous years continued as before and becoming an increasingly popular option on full-sized Oldsmobiles. Another new option for 1966 was a Tilt-and-Telescopic steering wheel that could be vertically adjusted to six different positions as well as telescoped outward from the instrument panel to improve driver comfort.

===1967===
For 1967, all GM full-size cars received a mid cycle freshening that featured fuller body panels. More rounded styling cues marked all 1967 Olds 88 models which received longer hoods and shorter decks and more sweeping fastback rooflines on 88 Holiday coupes to emulate the styling of Olds&#x27; front-wheel-drive flagship, the Toronado. Olds 88s received a three part front grille made op of a center prow flanked on either side by headlight pods. For the first time since 1959, the dual headlights were split apart by parking lights. Taillights for 88s featured a waterfall design. Interiors made extensive use of wood-tone panels, and bright metal finishes were kept to a minimum.

Model wise, there was more name juggling. The Delmont 88 was introduced for 1967 and produced for just two years, replacing both the Jetstar 88 and Dynamic 88 model lines. The Delmont featured the 330 V8 as standard and the 425 V8 as an option in 1967 and the new stroked &quot;Rocket 455&quot; version of the same engine in 1968. The 425 was standard on the Delta 88. The Delta 88 gained a new sub series called the Delta 88 Custom which had a plusher interior than the standard Delta 88 featuring a Strato bench seat in the Holiday Sedan (four-door hardtop) or, in the Holiday Coupe (two-door hardtop), a choice of either Strato bucket seats with console or Strato bench seat with armrest. The Delta Custom Holiday Coupe was essentially a successor to the former 88-based Starfire series offered in previous years (1961–66) but with a standard 88 semi-fastback roofline rather than the Starfire&#x27;s squared off roof with concave rear window. Another styling cue for the Delta Custom was the addition of a second set of tail light reflectors set into the lower portion of the bumper.

New options for 1967 included front disc brakes, stereo 8-track tape player and a Climate Combustion Control system for Rocket V8s designed to regulate carburetor air temperature, boost fuel economy, speed choke warm up and eliminate winter icing to permit easier starting and more efficient operation in cold weather.

The same assortment of 330 and 425 cubic-inch V8 engines were carried over from 1966, as were most transmission offerings except the optional four-speed manual with Hurst shifter, which was discontinued due to low buyer interest.

===1968===

For 1968, the overall design was a carryover. New front end with split grille design that would become an Olds trademark in coming years highlighted all 1968 full-sized Oldsmobiles with horizontal lines on 88s and egg-crate patterns on Ninety-Eights, along with concealed windshield wipers. The split grille was inspired by fighter aircraft at the time with delta wings and dual air intakes for the jet engine as introduced on the Convair F-102 Delta Dagger.
The Delmont 88 got a larger 350 cubic-inch V8 as standard equipment and the optional V8 that was standard on Delta 88/Custom and Ninety-Eight was jacked up to 455 cubic inches with a W-33 option primarily designed as part of the division&#x27;s police package available as an RPO on all 88&#x27;s. Horsepower ratings of other Olds engines included 250 for the 350 two-barrel standard in the Delmont 88, 310 for the four-barrel 350 optional in the Delmont 88. A 455 two-barrel rated at was standard on the Delta 88/Custom and optional on the Delmont 88. Optional on all 88s was a four-barrel 455 rated at from the larger C-body Ninety-Eight. Both the 350 and 455 two-barrel Rocket V8 engines were designed to use regular gasoline while the optional 350 and 455 four-barrel carbureted &quot;Ultra High Compression&quot; Super Rocket V8s required premium fuel.

===1969===
The 1969 88 series dropped the Delmont name, leaving the Delta 88 as the base model of the series. The Delta 88 Royale trim, only available on a Holiday Coupe, was added as line-topper above the Delta 88 Custom. It came standard with a more luxurious interior featuring a notchback vinyl upholstered bench seat with armrest or Strato bucket seats with optional center console. For safety, a ceiling mounted shoulder belt was offered in the front seats for both the driver and right passenger. This arrangement provided five belt buckles in the front bench seat. The standard engine in the base Delta 88 was a 350 cu in, low compression ratio (9.0:1) Rocket V8 with a Rochester two-barrel carburetor that was rated at at 4,600 rpm and of torque ran on leaded regular 94 RON gasoline. Standard on the Delta 88 Custom and Royale models and optional on the base series was a low compression two-barrel version of the 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8 rated at designed to use regular fuel. Optional on all Delta 88s was the four-barrel Ultra High Compression 455 cubic-inch Super Rocket V8 rated at . Top option was the version of the four-barrel 455 V8 designed to run on 98 RON octane fuel available in all Delta 88 models as the W-33 option.

The two-speed Jetaway automatic that was previously offered as an option on the smaller engine 88 models was dropped completely in favor of the GM three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic 400 transmission previously only offered with the larger engines. Also a new GM-designed Variable-Ratio Power Steering system was introduced as an option.

All full-sized Oldsmobiles were completely restyled for 1969 with more squared off bodylines and rooflines for the Holiday coupes and sedans replacing the semi-fastback look of 1967–68, and ventless front windows on all models. Wheelbases were increased to . Though the 1969 models were extensively restyled, the basic 1965 chassis design and inner-body structure was retained along with the roofline on the pillared four-door Town sedans.

Inside, headrests were now standard equipment and a new instrument panel included square instruments replacing the round instruments of previous years along with a push-button operated ashtray and rotary glove compartment knob, as well as heating/air conditioning controls relocated from the center of the dash to the left of the steering wheel near the lights and wiper switches. The high-beam lights indicator was a red rocket located on the dash. Also new was a steering column-mounted ignition switch that also locked the steering wheel when not in use – a feature found on all 1969-model General Motors passenger cars, a year before locking steering columns were required by federal mandate starting in 1970.

===1970===

Only detail changes were made for the 1970 full-sized Oldsmobiles including a new split grille that no longer extended to surround the headlights and a slightly revised rear section. Powertrain selections were carried over from 1969 with both 350 and 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8s now featuring &quot;Positive Valve Rotators&quot; for longer engine life and more efficient operation. A new antenna impregnated into the windshield was introduced this year that replaced the previous fender-mounted unit and was included as standard equipment on all cars equipped with a factory radio. New option this year was a wiper/washer switch mounted in the shift lever knob. Optional radio was a stereo AM-FM radio and a lower dash mounted eight track tape player.

The 1965–1970 GM B platform is the fourth best selling automobile platform in history after the Volkswagen Beetle, Ford Model T and the Lada Riva.

==Seventh generation (1971–1976)==
===1971===
All GM B-body full-size cars were completely restyled and enlarged for 1971, but continued to ride on a wheelbase. It reached its maximum size in 1974 at an astounding in length. It was available as a pillared four-door Town Sedan, two-door and four-door Holiday hardtops and a convertible. Series models for 1971 included the base Delta 88, Delta 88 Custom and Delta 88 Royale, the latter inheriting the convertible body style previously offered on the base Delta 88. All models received fuselage styling somewhat similar to what Chrysler Corporation introduced on its 1969 models, and new rooflines with a more squared off greenhouse for Town sedans and more rounded lines for Holiday sedans and coupes – the latter receiving reverting to a semi-fastback format.

Also new for 1971 was the Custom Cruiser station wagon, the first full-sized Oldsmobile wagon since 1964. It used the 88&#x27;s B-body platform with a longer wheelbase (matching the larger C-body Ninety-Eight) with multi-leaf spring suspensions that differed entirely from the all-coil suspensions used in sedans and coupes. The Custom Cruiser came standard with the larger 455 Rocket V8 and utilized the disappearing clamshell tailgate of other full-size GM wagons.

Engine offerings again included 350 and 455-cubic-inch Rocket V8s ranging from 250 to 340 gross horsepower, all of which featured lowered compression ratios beginning in 1971 to enable use of lower octane regular leaded 91 RON octane, low-lead or unleaded gasoline. Vented power front disc brakes and variable-ratio power steering were now standard equipment on all 88 models. During the 1971 model year, the Turbo Hydra-matic 400 transmission was added to the standard equipment list.

Other highlights for 1971 included a wrap-around instrument panel shared with Ninety-Eight and Toronado models (Toronados had a slightly smoother upper leading edge design) that was highlighted by a large square speedometer and all controls within easy reach of the driver, and a one-year only Flo-Through ventilation system that utilized vents in the trunklid. The system used on all GM B-, C- and E-body cars and the Chevrolet Vega, used the heater fan to draw air into the car from the cowl intake, and force it out through vents in the trunk lid or tailgate. In theory, passengers could enjoy fresh air even when the car was moving slowly or stopped, as in heavy traffic. In practice, however, it didn&#x27;t work.

1971 was the last model year in which a 3-speed manual transmission was offered on full-sized Oldsmobiles; the rarely-ordered option was dropped in 1972.

Within weeks of the 1971 models&#x27; debut, however, Oldsmobile—and all other GM dealers—received multiple complaints from drivers who complained the ventilation system pulled cold air into the car before the heater could warm up—and could not be shut off. The ventilation system was extensively revised for 1972.

===1972===
For 1972, the Delta Custom series was dropped and the Royale series was expanded to include four-door Town and Holiday sedans. Advertised brake horsepower figures dropped to 155 for the base 350 two-barrel and 250 for the optional 455 four-barrel Rocket V8s thanks to an industry-wide switch in power measurements from the previous gross method (as measured by a dynamometer with no accessories attached) to the net method in which the power measurements were based upon an engine &quot;as installed&quot; in a vehicle with all emission controls and accessories hooked up. Only minor trim changes were made this year that included revised &quot;waterfall&quot; grilles in front and four-segment taillights in the rear. Inside a revised &quot;Flo-Through&quot; ventilation system utilizing vents in the doorjambs replaced the 1971 version which utilized vents in the trunklid.

===1973===
For 1973, wider and lower split waterfall grilles flanked a new federally mandated front bumper on all Delta 88 models and larger one-piece rounded rectangular taillights replaced the four-segmented lights of 1972. Engine offerings included a standard 350 Rocket V8 with two-barrel carburetor (150 net horsepower) or optional 455 Rocket V8 with four-barrel carburetion and with single exhaust or with dual exhausts. Model offerings were the same as 1972 with the Delta 88 Royale series now including the sole Olds convertible offering following the demise of the intermediate Cutlass Supreme convertible after 1972.

Director Sam Raimi regularly includes a 1973 Delta 88 in his films. Referred to as &quot;The Classic&quot; by the filmmaker, the car originally belonged to his parents and has made an appearance in the &quot;Evil Dead&quot; trilogy, his &quot;Spider-Man&quot; films with Tobey Maguire, &quot;Drag Me To Hell&quot; and &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot;.

===1974===
In 1974, a rear bumper was added and taillights reverted to a four-segment design similar to 1972 and the front grilles were narrowed and raised to hood level similar to 1971–72 models. Also, new rooflines were featured on Holiday hardtop coupes with large fixed triangular side windows in the widened &quot;C&quot; pillar. Unlike the big Chevrolet formal-roof coupes, the Olds retained a small roll-down rear window. As Oldsmobile completely discontinued two-barrel carbureted engines this year, a new 350 four-barrel Rocket V8 (175 horsepower) became standard equipment with the 455 available as an option. Other highlights this year included an all-new flat instrument panel shared with Ninety-Eight and Toronado models with horizontal sweep speedometer and &quot;Message Center&quot; system of warning lights replacing the wrap-around dash of previous years. A new and seldom-ordered option available on all full-sized Olds models and Toronados were driver&#x27;s and passenger&#x27;s-side airbags – among the first to be offered in a production automobile. The Delta 88 Royale ragtop was again the only convertible offered by Olds.

===1975===
Detail changes for 1975 included revised grilles and taillights along with new rear quarter windows for pillared and Holiday sedans – the latter&#x27;s design similar to an opera window in September 1974. The same assortment of 350 and 455-cubic-inch Rocket V8s were still offered along with a one-year-only (and seldom-ordered) option of a Pontiac-built 400-cubic-inch V8 with two-barrel carburetor and rating. All engines were hooked up to a catalytic converter that not only mandated the use of unleaded gasoline but also spelled the end of dual exhaust systems. 1975 was the final year for the Delta 88 Royale convertible, the last of which was built on July 11, 1975. Just under 7200 Delta 88 Royale convertibles were built in 1975 as Oldsmobile made a concerted effort to target the convertible buyer market at the time. The headline on a print ad for a 1975 Olds Delta 88 Royale convertible stated, &quot;Today a beautiful Olds convertible. Tomorrow, a collector&#x27;s item&quot;. The featured car in the ad was a red Delta 88 Royale rag top.

===1976===
For 1976, the final year of this generation, all Olds 88s received revised grille work, rectangular headlamps and parking lamps directly below instead of in the bumper, with Delta 88 Royale models also getting spring-loaded stand-up hood ornaments. It was also the final year for the Holiday hardtop coupes and sedans, along with the 455 Rocket V8 and the optional airbag system that would generally become universal on production cars and trucks some 15 years later. A one-year only option on Delta 88 Royale Holiday coupes was the Royale Crown Landau package that included a stainless steel roof bar, padded rear quarter vinyl roof, special hood ornament and color-keyed wheelcovers.

==Eighth generation (1977–1985)==

The 1977 Delta 88s and other GM B-body cars were considerably downsized from their predecessors in length and wheelbase ( – the same as the four-door 1973–77 A-body Cutlass Sedan) and nearly lighter in weight, with curb weights dropping to between depending on model. Other than a reduction in shoulder room, however, interior room was not adversely affected; in fact, headroom and rear seat legroom increased. Both base Delta 88 and Royale models were now only offered in two pillared body styles; a two-door coupe and a four-door Town Sedan. The 1977–1979 Custom Cruiser was now based on the Delta 88&#x27;s B-body rather than the Ninety-Eight&#x27;s C-body (thus also sharing the coil spring suspension, rather than the multi-leaf spring) and came with a two-way tailgate rather than the clamshell of 1971–76 models. A fuel economy gauge was optional.

The standard engine was now a Buick V6 with a Turbo-Hydramatic 200 automatic transmission. An Oldsmobile 260 was the base V8, followed by either a Chevrolet 350 (option code LM1) or Oldsmobile 350 (option code L34). Initially, the Oldsmobile engine came in California and high-altitude cars, the Chevrolet engine came in cars with Federal emissions equipment. The Olds engine returned later in the model year. Oldsmobile&#x27;s new 403 was the top engine option and came with a THM350 transmission.

The use of a Chevrolet engine caused a situation known as the &quot;Chevy-mobile&quot; affair. GM settled with some Oldsmobile owners by offering them warranty extensions for the Chevrolet-engined Oldsmobiles, or the option of returning those cars in exchange for an Oldsmobile with a genuine Rocket V8. The &quot;return car&quot; option wasn&#x27;t commonly chosen, because the owner had to pay GM for mileage driven, which could become expensive. This began the era of &quot;corporate&quot; engines, and for many years GM advertisements would include a disclaimer stating &#x27;&quot;Oldsmobiles (or other divisions) are equipped with engines manufactured by various GM divisions, subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide.&quot;&#x27;

As in previous years, base Delta 88 and Royale models differed mainly in exterior and interior trim. Base Deltas had a full bench seat available in cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl upholstery, while Royales had a notchback bench seat with armrest or optional 60/40 notchback bench, also available in cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl trim. All 88s featured an all-new instrument panel with a horizontal sweep speedometer and heater/air conditioning controls moved to the center of the dash above the radio from the left side of the dash, and continued with the &quot;Message Center&quot; bank of warning lights. The new dash was highlighted with woodgrain trim. The dimmer switch moved from the floor to the turn-signal lever.

For 1978, a Holiday 88 coupe was added to the lineup, featuring Strato bucket seats along with console and floor shifter, Super Stock wheels and two-tone paint schemes. All 88 models received new grilles and revised taillights with drivetrains the same as 1977 except for the addition of the 350 Diesel V8 to the option list.

The 1979 model year saw the addition of a new Delta 88 Royale Brougham series, which included plush &quot;pillowed&quot; seat trim similar to the Ninety-Eight. All models again received revised grilles and other minor changes. It was the last year for the 403 V8 as federal fuel-economy mandates spelled the end of larger engines in order to meet those requirements.

For 1980, all 88s got new and more aerodynamic sheetmetal for improved fuel economy highlighted by rounded square taillights similar to mid-70s 88s, but overall dimensions stayed the same and coupes received a revised roofline. New to the engine lineup was the Rocket V8 with four-barrel carburetor and . All other engines except the now-discontinued 403 were carried over from 1979.

Only minor grille and taillight lens revisions highlighted the 1981 Delta 88s. The gasoline 350 Rocket V8 was dropped from the option list, leaving only the diesel version available. All other engines including the Buick 231 V6 and Oldsmobile 260 and 307 Rocket V8s were continued. All gasoline engines received GM&#x27;s new Computer Command Control engine management system. This system was the forerunner of today&#x27;s OBD-II which is standard on all cars sold in the United States. The system read various parameters, such as vehicle speed, throttle position, engine speed, coolant temperature, and the oxygen content of the exhaust to provide the correct air/fuel mixture for any given driving condition. Also new for 1981 was GM&#x27;s Turbo-Hydramatic 200-4R transmission, which added an overdrive gear and torque converter clutch (TCC) to contribute to fuel economy and engine longevity. The sporty Holiday 88 coupe was offered for the last time this year.
The 1982 model year saw only minor trim changes for Delta 88, Royale and Royale Brougham models. The same assortment of engines/transmissions were carried over from previous years, though the small 260 V8 was offered for the last time. For 1983, all Oldsmobile 88s received new grilles, hood ornaments and minor trim revisions, including new steering wheels. This would be the last year for the base Delta 88 line, leaving only the Royale and Royale Brougham. Engine offerings were down to three, a standard Buick 231 cubic-inch V6, or optional Oldsmobile V8s including the 307 Rocket and 350 Diesel.

For 1984, all Delta 88s were now Royale or Royale Brougham models. Styling highlights included new grille inserts and red and amber taillights replacing the red lenses. At midyear, a new Royale Brougham LS was added to the 88 line, almost simultaneously with the introduction of a new and downsized 1985 front-wheel drive Ninety-Eight. With the Ninety-Eight being downsized and converted to front-drive, the Royale Brougham LS model of the 88 was now the largest and most luxurious rear-wheel drive car offered by Oldsmobile. Custom Cruiser wagons continued with the same styling changes found on other 88 models.

Only minor changes marked the 1985 model, which was in its last year before a major downsizing and conversion to front-wheel-drive. The same assortment of models in the Royale, Brougham and Brougham LS continued as before, Amber rear turn signals were added. The &#x27;85 88s would be the last full-sized Oldsmobile sedans and coupes to feature rear-wheel-drive, Rocket V8 power, and body-on-frame construction. Though the 88 sedans and coupes were downsized and switched to front-drive for 1986, the Custom Cruiser station wagons would continue virtually unchanged through the 1990 model year, and eventually become the only Oldsmobile model powered by an Oldsmobile Rocket V8 engine, for which production ended in 1990 after 42 years.

==Ninth generation (1986–1991)==



In late 1985, for the 1986 model year, the Delta 88 Royale switched platforms from the GM B platform to the smaller front-wheel drive H platform, with a wheelbase of . The headlights changed from square sealed beam quads to integrated regular/high beam composite lamps in 1987. A few NASCAR teams built racecars with 1986 Delta 88 Royale sheetmetal and ran them on the circuit in the 86–88 seasons, but only one victory (with Terry Labonte) was scored.

Due to the federal mandate to add passive restraints, door mounted seat belts were added for 1987. For 1988, rear shoulder belts were added and anti-lock brakes became an option. For 1989, the &quot;Delta&quot; name was dropped, as was the hood ornament, leaving the model to simply become the &quot;Eighty Eight,&quot; now spelled out instead of using the &quot;88&quot; in numerical form. Also that year, the amber color was deleted from the taillights and a driver side airbag became an available option.

The Eighty Eight Royale was given a mild facelift in 1990, eliminating the former chromed grille for a body-colored fascia with four slots and the Oldsmobile Rocket logo. In the rear, new taillights and backup lights extended across the body; once again, chrome trim was deleted. Minor revisions were also made to the interior. Part of the door panel was revised and the 1990 model also offered new cloth for the seats while the pillow cushion seats on the Brougham were discontinued. A revised armrest console was added which provided more room.

1991 was the last year for the coupe and last year for this generation Eighty Eight. Various previously optional features such as pulse wipers and tilt steering wheel became standard. The model range during this time was the Eighty Eight Royale and more upscale Eighty Eight Royale Brougham. 1991 would be the last year for the &quot;Brougham&quot; trim level on the Eighty Eight.

Engines:
Transmissions:
* 1986–1988.5 – 440-T4 4-speed automatic overdrive
* 1988.5–1991 – 4T60 4-speed automatic overdrive

===Voice diagnostic system===
This generation of Delta 88s has an optional voice diagnostic system that alerted the driver of problems. The voice is male and computer synthesized.

In the event of a warning, the door chime plays three times rapidly and then played the voice alert. This happens twice in case the driver misses the warning the first time; every alert also has a corresponding light on the instrument cluster.

Warnings include:

* &quot;The engine coolant level is low!&quot;
* &quot;The engine is overheating! Please stop the engine and consult the owner&#x27;s manual!&quot;
* &quot;The park brake is not fully released!&quot;
* &quot;The key is in the ignition!&quot; (upon opening the door with the key inserted into the ignition)
* &quot;The headlights are on!&quot; (upon turning off the car with the headlights on) A light would also appear on the dash.

== Tenth generation (1992–1999)==



The Oldsmobile Eighty Eight was redesigned for 1992, following the redesign of the Ninety Eight the previous year. This was the last Eighty Eight or 88 model from Oldsmobile (along with its performance LSS and Regency models) before being discontinued in 1999 and being replaced in 2001 with the Aurora. The 3.8 L Buick V6 was still the only engine, but output increased to and of torque.

The Eighty-Eight&#x27;s front and rear were restyled for 1996, and with it the nomenclature was changed from &quot;Eighty Eight Royale&quot; to three models – Eighty Eight, Eighty Eight LS and LSS (A &quot;Luxury Sports Sedan&quot; targeted to male European car buyers, available with a supercharged V6 and a floor mounted gear shifter). It is important to note, however, early LSS models (1995) were rarely equipped with the 3800 Supercharged engine. The LSS was originally a trim level package on the 88 starting in 1992. In 1996 the LSS received Aurora-inspired seats. 1996 was the final year that the original-style rocket (in black and silver) appeared on a hood emblem. 1997 would welcome the new Oldsmobile logo on all Eighty-Eight trims except the Regency.

After the demise of the Ninety-Eight in 1996, Oldsmobile added the Regency to the 1997 and 1998 lineups, which used the same front fenders and chrome grille as the Ninety-Eight sedan but kept the standard Eighty-Eight body. The Regency featured a long list of standard features including traction control, leather upholstery, dual 6-way power seats with power lumbar and a driver&#x27;s side memory function, a dual-zone automatic climate control system, and an electronic level control for the rear suspension. A driver&#x27;s side electrochromic outside mirror was also standard on the Regency, a feature that even Cadillac didn&#x27;t offer as standard equipment. The interior day/night auto-dimming mirror was linked to the outside mirror and dimmed both with the same intensity at the same time. Some of these options, like the 2-driver memory feature, were not available on the Eighty-Eight Royale or LSS.

To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 88/Eighty-Eight nameplate, Oldsmobile offered a special 50th Anniversary Edition of the 1999 Eighty-Eight. This edition included front and rear leather bench seats from the 98/Regency, steering wheel with audio and HVAC controls, the older rocket logo, electronic climate control unit, gold plated badges, and special Anniversary badges on the C-pillars and front door panels.

All four vehicles used the same wheelbase and shared an updated version of the H-body. The suspension tuning, interior appointments, and certain exterior trim was used to differentiate the three models.

Engines:
* 1992–1994 3.8 L (231 in³) 3800 Series I V6, 
* 1995–1999 3.8 L (231 in³) 3800 Series II V6, 
* 1995 3.8 L (231 in³) supercharged 3800 Series I V6, which was only installed on 100 vehicles of its kind.
* 1996–1999 3.8 L (231 in³) supercharged 3800 Series II V6, 

From 1992 to 1999, Eighty Eight models were produced in Lake Orion, Michigan, Flint, Michigan, and Wentzville, Missouri.

Year-to-year changes:
* 1992: The redesign. Models included the Eighty-Eight Royale and the Eighty-Eight Royale LS. The 1992 full line Oldsmobile factory brochure makes brief mention of the LSS (Luxury Sport Sedan) model in one small photo, yet it doesn&#x27;t appear later in the options summary. 
* 1993: Trunk mounted key cover emblem removed. The Eighty-Eight LSS returned with better factory promotion of its sporty option package that included: Bucket seats (a pair of right-hand halves of the standard 60/40 split bench seat), steering wheel audio and HVAC controls, floor shifter and center console (borrowed from the previous generation Pontiac Bonneville SSE) in the interior, and full instrumentation for the dash. Sixteen inch alloy wheels, higher spring rates and larger diameter stabilizer bars for the front and rear suspension gave the LSS a firm ride and more controlled handling. 
* 1994: The first facelift: Front grille and headlamps were redesigned, aluminum turbine rims became available. A major redesign to the dash added a passenger side airbag.
* 1995: The 3.8L V6 engine was bumped from to . All models shared this same 3.8L engine. The optional L67 3800 Supercharged engine, making , was made an available option for the LSS, and later other models. First OEM GPS system introduced by any manufacturer, the Oldsmobile &quot;Guidestar&quot;, as an option.
* 1996: The second facelift: Revised front grille, headlights, and body trim. Tail-lamps and rear reflector bar were slightly reshaped. All models were renamed from &quot;Eighty Eight Royale&quot; to &quot;Eighty Eight&quot; and &quot;Eighty Eight LS&quot; ([LS] which migrated from an 88 Royale trim). The LSS continued with the same changes to the exterior as other models, the addition of Aurora styled seats, but the same center console was retained for one more year. The supercharged LSS engine was bumped from to .
* 1997: An upscale, &quot;fully loaded&quot; version of the Eighty-Eight was introduced as the &quot;Oldsmobile Regency.&quot; All Oldsmobile Eighty Eight and LSS models (except for the Regency) changed badges and steering-wheel engravings from the &#x27;80s Oldsmobile &quot;Rocket&quot; logo to the 1997–2004 Oldsmobile &quot;Rocket Oval&quot; logo, borrowed from the Aurora&#x27;s symbol. The Eighty Eight LS received integral fog lights as standard. The center console in interiors equipped with bucket seats was redesigned, integrating into the lower dash; this allowed for rear passenger vents and two cup holders for the front occupants.
* 1998: Last year for the Regency which kept the old &quot;Rocket&quot; logo. 
* 1999: Last year for both Eighty Eight and LSS models. This was also the last Oldsmobile sedan to have 6-passenger seating as an option. The last Oldsmobile LSS was produced on September 23, 1998. The last Oldsmobile Eighty Eight 50th Anniversary Edition was manufactured on January 6, 1999.

===Oldsmobile Guidestar===
The Guidestar system was based upon the preceding TravTek GPS that Oldsmobile developed in conjunction with Avis Rent a Car and AAA, which was tested in the 1990 through 1992 Toronado Trofeo. After the Toronado was discontinued, Oldsmobile continued working on the system with GM&#x27;s Hughes Electronics division and EDS. The finished product, Guidestar, was a hard disk-based system that offered satellite navigation for 17 states but lacked live traffic updates. The states were California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Virginia. It was a $2,000 option, plus $400 per map cartridge. It was the first on-board navigation system to be offered on a US production car, the 1995 Oldsmobile 88.

<text>Vitaphone was a sound film system used for feature films and nearly 1,000 short subjects made by Warner Bros. and its sister studio First National from 1926 to 1931. Vitaphone is the last major analog sound-on-disc system and the only one that was widely used and commercially successful. The soundtrack is not printed on the film, but issued separately on phonograph records. The discs, recorded at  rpm (a speed first used for this system) and typically in diameter, are played on a turntable physically coupled to the projector motor while the film is projected. Its frequency response is 4300 Hz. Many early talkies, such as &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; (1927), used the Vitaphone system. The name &quot;Vitaphone&quot; derived from the Latin and Greek words, respectively, for &quot;living&quot; and &quot;sound&quot;.

The &quot;Vitaphone&quot; trademark was later associated with cartoons and other short subjects that had optical soundtracks and did not use discs.

==Early history==

In the early 1920s, Western Electric was developing both sound-on-film and sound-on-disc systems, aided by the purchase of Lee De Forest&#x27;s Audion amplifier tube in 1913, consequent advances in public address systems, and the first practical condenser microphone, which Western Electric engineer E.C. Wente had created in 1916 and greatly improved in 1922. De Forest debuted his own Phonofilm sound-on-film system in New York City on April 15, 1923, but due to the relatively poor sound quality of Phonofilm and the impressive state-of-the-art sound heard in Western Electric&#x27;s private demonstrations, the Warner Brothers decided to go forward with the industrial giant and the more familiar disc technology.

The business was established at Western Electric&#x27;s Bell Laboratories in New York City and acquired by Warner Bros. in April 1925. Warner Bros. introduced Vitaphone on August 5, 1926, with the premiere of their silent feature &quot;Don Juan&quot;, which had been retrofitted with a symphonic musical score and sound effects. There was no spoken dialog. The feature was preceded by a program of short subjects with live-recorded sound, nearly all featuring classical instrumentalists and opera stars. The only &quot;pop music&quot; artist was guitarist Roy Smeck and the only actual &quot;talkie&quot; was the short film that opened the program: four minutes of introductory remarks by motion picture industry spokesman Will Hays, (&quot;Introduction of Vitaphone Sound Pictures&quot;).

&quot;Don Juan&quot; was able to draw huge sums of money at the box office, but was not able to recoup the expenses Warner Bros. put into the film&#x27;s production. After its financial failure, Paramount head Adolph Zukor offered Sam Warner a deal as an executive producer for Paramount if he brought Vitaphone with him. Sam, not wanting to take any more of Harry Warner&#x27;s refusal to move forward with using sound in future Warner films, agreed to accept Zukor&#x27;s offer, but the deal died after Paramount lost money in the wake of Rudolph Valentino&#x27;s death. Harry eventually agreed to accept Sam&#x27;s demands. Sam then pushed ahead with a new Vitaphone feature starring Al Jolson, the Broadway dynamo who had already scored a big hit with early Vitaphone audiences in &quot;A Plantation Act&quot;, a musical short released on October 7, 1926. On October 6, 1927, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; premiered at the Warner Theater in New York City, broke box-office records, established Warner Bros. as a major player in Hollywood, and is traditionally credited with single-handedly launching the talkie revolution.

At first, the production of Vitaphone shorts and the recording of orchestral scores were strictly a New York phenomenon, taking advantage of the bountiful supply of stage and concert hall talent there, but the Warners soon migrated some of this activity to their more spacious facilities on the West Coast. Dance band leader Henry Halstead is given credit for starring in the first Vitaphone short subject filmed in Hollywood instead of New York. &quot;Carnival Night in Paris&quot; (1927) featured the Henry Halstead Orchestra and a cast of hundreds of costumed dancers in a Carnival atmosphere.

==Process==

From the perspective of the cast and crew on the sound stage, there was little difference between filming with Vitaphone and a sound-on-film system. In the early years of sound, the noisy cameras and their operators were enclosed in soundproofed booths with small windows made of thick glass. Cables suspended the microphones in fixed positions just above camera range, and sometimes they were hidden behind objects in the scene. The recording machines were usually located in a separate building to completely isolate them from sound stage floor vibrations and other undesirable influences. The audio signal was sent from an on-stage monitoring and control booth to the recording room over a heavy shielded cable. Synchronization was maintained by driving all the cameras and recorders with synchronous electric motors powered from a common source. When music and sound effects were being recorded to accompany existing film footage, the film was projected so that the conductor could synchronize the music with the visual cues and it was the projector, rather than a camera, that was electrically interlocked with the recording machine.

Except for the unusual disc size and speed, the physical record-making process was the same one employed by contemporary record companies to make smaller discs for home use. The recording lathe cut an audio-signal-modulated spiral groove into the polished surface of a thick round slab of wax-like material rotating on a turntable. The wax was much too soft to be played in the usual way, but a specially supported and guided pickup could be used to play it back immediately in order to detect any sound problems that might have gone unnoticed during the filming. If problems were found, the scene could then be re-shot while everything was still in place, minimizing additional expense. Even the lightest playback caused some damage to the wax master, so it was customary to employ two recorders and simultaneously record two waxes, one to play and the other to be sent for processing if that &quot;take&quot; of the scene was approved. At the processing plant, the surface of the wax was rendered electrically conductive and electroplated to produce a metal mold or &quot;stamper&quot; with a ridge instead of a groove, and this was used to press hard shellac discs from molten &quot;biscuits&quot; of the raw material.

Because of the universal desirability of an immediate playback capability, even studios using sound-on-film systems employed a wax disc &quot;playback machine&quot; in tandem with their film recorders, as it was impossible to play an optical recording until it had made the round trip to the film processing laboratory.

A Vitaphone-equipped theater had normal projectors which had been furnished with special phonograph turntables and pickups; a fader; an amplifier; and a loudspeaker system. The projectors operated just as motorized silent projectors did, but at a fixed speed of 24 frames per second and mechanically interlocked with the attached turntables. When each projector was threaded, the projectionist would align a start mark on the film with the film gate, then cue up the corresponding soundtrack disc on the turntable, being careful to place the phonograph needle at a point indicated by an arrow scribed on the record&#x27;s surface. When the projector was started, it rotated the linked turntable and (in theory) automatically kept the record &quot;in sync&quot; (correctly synchronized) with the projected image.

The Vitaphone process made several improvements over previous systems:
* Amplification – The Vitaphone system used electronic amplification based on Lee De Forest&#x27;s Audion tube. This allowed the sound to be played to a large audience at a comfortable volume. Vitaphone was far from the first sound film system to use this technology, but it had amplifiers and loudspeakers, developed by Western Electric, which were state-of-the-art. Their performance was greatly superior to anything else of the kind then available, including the equipment used by De Forest to present his own Phonofilm sound-on-film exhibitions.
* Fidelity – Contrary to conventional wisdom, neither Vitaphone&#x27;s ability to fill a theater with an adequate volume of sound nor its success in maintaining synchronization was unprecedented. Léon Gaumont&#x27;s sound-on-disc films, which were being shown twenty years earlier, were successfully synchronized by the use of electrically interlinked multi-pole synchronous motors, and a pneumatic amplification system more than sufficed to fill Gaumont&#x27;s 3,400-seat flagship theater in Paris with the recorded sound. That sound, however, had to be recorded by the same insensitive non-electronic method introduced by Thomas Edison in 1877, or alternatively by a very crude microphone-based variant which had logistical advantages but did not offer improved fidelity. The resulting sound, however greatly amplified it might be, was tinny and unclear and speech was difficult to understand. The footsteps and other incidental sounds that audiences instinctively expected to hear were missing. It did not sound &quot;natural&quot;. The Vitaphone system derived from extensive work on electronically recording and reproducing sound that had been carried out at Western Electric during the first half of the 1920s. Western Electric&#x27;s engineers had developed a highly sensitive full-frequency-range condenser microphone, capable of capturing a whisper from several feet away, along with the electronic and mechanical equipment necessary to adequately record the audio signal it produced. As a result, the quality of Vitaphone sound in the theater came as a revelation to the audience at its public debut in 1926. It easily and dramatically surpassed anything previously achieved. It even surpassed the sound quality of Western Electric&#x27;s own sound-on-film system, developed concurrently with the sound-on-disc system but still in the laboratory at that time, because at first the discs yielded better fidelity than an optical sound track.

These innovations notwithstanding, the Vitaphone process lost the early format war with sound-on-film processes for many reasons:
* Distribution – Vitaphone records had to be distributed along with film prints, and shipping the records required a whole infrastructure apart from the already-existing film distribution system. The records would start to suffer from audible wear after an estimated 20 playings (a check box system on the label was used to keep count) and were then supposed to be replaced with a fresh set. Damage and breakage were inherent dangers, so a spare set of discs was usually kept on hand, further adding to the costs.
* Synchronization – Vitaphone was vulnerable to severe synchronization problems, famously spoofed in MGM&#x27;s 1952 musical &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;. If a record were improperly cued up, it would start out of sync with the picture and the projectionist would have to try to manually acquire sync. If the wrong record had been cued up there was no realistic option but to pause the show for a few minutes while swapping in the correct disc, resetting everything and starting that reel again. If the film print became damaged and was not precisely repaired, the relationship between the record and the print would be thrown off, also causing a loss of sync. Vitaphone projectors had special levers and linkages to advance and retard sync, but only within certain limits. Scrupulous care and attention were demanded from the projectionist. In the absence of human error and the occasional malfunction that can befall any complicated machine, the Vitaphone system worked as intended, but when a problem did occur it could be an embarrassing disaster.
* Editing – A phonograph record cannot be physically edited, and this significantly limited the creative potential of Vitaphone films. Warner Bros. went to great expense to develop a highly complex phonograph-based dubbing system, using synchronous motors and Strowger switch-triggered playback phonographs. Multiple source discs would be carefully cued up, then parts of each in turn were dubbed to a new master disc. The cutting of the new wax master could not be paused, so each playback turntable had to be started at just the right moment and each signal switched to the recorder at just the right moment. The system worked, but imprecisely enough that the reel of film often required some adjustment, by adding or removing one or more film frames at imperfectly matched edit points, to conform it to the disc of edited sound. This discouraged frequent changes of scene in the film and the lively pace that they created. Editing sound on disc was a nightmare for the editor, and it was increasingly obvious to everyone that while the system sufficed for musical shorts and a synchronized musical accompaniment for otherwise silent films (the only applications originally planned), it was a clumsy way to make a feature-length film with &quot;live&quot; sound. By the middle of 1931, Warner Bros.-First National had thrown in the towel and was recording and editing optical sound on film, like all the other studios, and only then dubbing the completed soundtrack to discs for use with the Vitaphone projection system.
* Fidelity versus Sound-on-Film – The fidelity of sound-on-film processes was improved considerably after the early work by Lee De Forest on his Phonofilm system and that of his former associate Theodore Case on what eventually became the Fox Movietone system, introduced in 1927. The De Forest and Case-Fox systems used variable-density soundtracks, but the variable-area soundtrack used by RCA Photophone, introduced in 1928, eventually predominated. Although the fidelity of optical sound never quite caught up with ongoing improvements in disc recording technology, for practical purposes the early quality advantage of discs had been overcome within a few years.

Vitaphone was the market leader in the early days of talking pictures, for two key reasons. First, the new novelty was very popular with the public, with &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; being a monster hit. It was in theater owners&#x27; best interest to compete as soon as possible. Second, a much more practical reason was the cost. Converting a silent-only theater to sound was much quicker and cheaper with the Vitaphone sound-on-disc system than it was with the Movietone sound-on-film system. Exhibitors with limited incomes opted for Vitaphone, particularly in smaller towns. The Vitaphone brand name became synonymous with talking pictures in general; as early as 1928, theater organists, thrown out of work when their bosses discontinued silent pictures, placed situation-wanted ads in trade papers with the melancholy phrase &quot;Reason for leaving due to Vitaphone.&quot;

After the improvement of the competing sound-on-film systems, Vitaphone&#x27;s disadvantages led to its retirement early in the sound era. Warner Bros. and First National stopped recording directly to disc and switched to RCA Photophone sound-on-film recording. Warner Bros. had to publicly concede that Vitaphone was being retired, but put a positive spin on it by announcing that Warner films would now be available in &quot;both&quot; sound-on-film and sound-on-disc versions. Thus, instead of making a grudging admission that its technology had become obsolete, Warner Bros. purported to be doing the entire movie industry a favor.

Despite the fact that Warner Bros. still used Vitaphone as a brand name, the soundtrack-disc era was largely over by 1931. Many theater owners, who had invested heavily in Vitaphone equipment only a short time before, were financially unable or unwilling to replace their sound-on-disc-only equipment. Their continuing need for discs compelled most Hollywood studios to prepare sets of soundtrack discs for their new films, made by dubbing from the optical soundtracks, and supply them as required. This practice continued, although on an ever-dwindling scale, through 1937.

==Vitaphone soundtrack discs==

In 1924–1925, when Western Electric established the format of the system which would eventually be named Vitaphone, they settled on a diameter disc rotating at  rpm as a good practical compromise of disc size and speed. The slow speed permitted the 11-minute playing time needed to match the maximum running time of a then-standard 1000 foot (300 meter) reel of film projected at 24 fps, yet the increased diameter preserved the average effective groove velocity, and therefore the sound quality, of a smaller, shorter-playing record rotating at the then-standard speed of about 78 rpm.

Like ordinary pre-vinyl records, Vitaphone discs were made of a shellac compound rendered lightly abrasive by its major constituent, finely pulverized rock. Such records were played with a very inexpensive, imprecisely mass-produced steel needle with a point that quickly wore to fit the contour of the groove, but then went on to wear out in the course of playing one disc side, after which it was meant to be discarded and replaced. Unlike ordinary records, Vitaphone discs were recorded inside out, so that the groove started near the synchronization arrow scribed in the blank area around the label and proceeded outward. During playback, the needle would therefore be fresh where the groove&#x27;s undulations were most closely packed and needed the most accurate tracing, and suffering from wear only as the much more widely spaced and easily traced undulations toward the edge of the disc were encountered.

Initially, Vitaphone discs had a recording on one side only, each reel of film having its own disc. As the sound-on-disc method was slowly relegated to second-class status, cost-cutting changes were instituted, first by making use of both sides of each disc for non-consecutive reels of film, then by reducing the discs to in diameter. The use of RCA Victor&#x27;s new &quot;Vitrolac&quot;, a lightweight, flexible and less abrasive vinyl-based compound, made it possible to downsize the discs while actually improving their sound quality.

There were exceptions to the standard size of 1920s Vitaphone discs. In the case of very short films, such as trailers and some of the earliest musical shorts, the recording, still cut at  rpm and working outward from a minimum diameter of about , was pressed on a disc when the smaller size sufficed.

==Vitaphone shorts==

Warners bought the Vitagraph studio in 1925 and used its Brooklyn, New York facility for working out practical sound-film production techniques and filming musical shorts. The previously nameless Western Electric sound-on-disc system was named Vitaphone, deriving from the Warner-owned Vitagraph name. 

Although Warners&#x27; sound feature films were made in Hollywood, most of the short subjects were made in New York, and Vitaphone shorts became a fixture in movie-theater programs through 1940. Many major names in show business filmed their acts for posterity, and many stars of the future made their screen debuts for Vitaphone. Performers in early Vitaphone shorts filmed at the Flatbush studios include Al Jolson, Humphrey Bogart, Jimmy Stewart, Bob Hope, Adelaide Hall, Spencer Tracy, Jack Benny, Sammy Davis Jr., Sylvia Sidney, Pat O&#x27;Brien, Ruth Etting, Mischa Elman, Frances Langford, Betty Hutton, Burns and Allen, Giovanni Martinelli, Xavier Cugat, Bill Robinson, Lillian Roth, Joan Blondell, Judith Anderson, Ethel Merman, Abbe Lane, Eleanor Powell, Helen Morgan, The Nicholas Brothers, Milton Berle, Leo Carrillo, Harriet Nelson, Brian Donlevy, Jane Froman, Jack Haley, Phil Silvers, Roger Wolfe Kahn, Judy Canova, Nina Mae McKinney, Marjorie Main, Rose Marie, Joe Penner, Ethel Waters, June Allyson, Shemp Howard, Lanny Ross, Lionel Stander, Edgar Bergen, and Cyd Charisse.

==The Vitaphone Project==
In 1991, The Vitaphone Project was started by a group of five vintage record collectors and movie enthusiasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;picking.com/vitaphone&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Since the soundtrack discs and film prints of Vitaphone productions often became separated, The Vitaphone Project searches for original 16-inch soundtrack discs and mute film elements that go with surviving soundtrack discs. The Vitaphone Project borrows or purchases soundtrack discs from private collectors and often works with the restoration labs at the University of California at Los Angeles to create new 35mm preservation prints that combine the original picture and sound elements. The Vitaphone Project also often partners with the Library of Congress and the British Film Institute.

As of December 2016, The Vitaphone Project had located about 6,500 soundtrack discs in private collections and helped preserve 125 films, 12 of which were feature-length films. They have also raised $400,000 in donations, with Hugh Hefner being a notable donor.

The Vitaphone Project has been able to help restore films featuring stars such as Rose Marie and Al Jolson. They also worked with Warner Brothers to restore 1929&#x27;s &quot;Why Be Good?&quot;, the final silent film made by Colleen Moore. Funding raised by The Vitaphone Project was used to restore 1928&#x27;s &quot;The Beau Brummels&quot;, starring vaudeville duo Al Shaw and Sam Lee, which was added to the National Film Registry in 2016.

==Vitaphone and Vitagraph brand names==
Warner Bros. was careful to preserve the Vitaphone and Vitagraph brand names, just as it had preserved the First National brand name for its second-echelon feature films. 

Vitaphone had made its reputation largely for its short subjects, so the Warner live-action shorts and animated cartoons were copyrighted by The Vitaphone Corporation until 1959 and marketed under the Vitaphone brand name. 

Vitagraph had ceased operations in 1925. In 1932, producer Leon Schlesinger made a very-low-budget series of six John Wayne western features. These were so very cheap that Warner Bros. elected not to put its own name on them, or even the First National name. They were released under the Vitagraph name, which Warner still owned.

Warner Bros. stopped making live-action short subjects in 1956, and The Vitaphone Corporation was officially dissolved at the end of 1959. Warner then used the brand names for various purposes, to keep them active legally. In the 1950s, the Warner Bros. record label boasted &quot;Vitaphonic&quot; high-fidelity recording. In the 1960s, the end titles of &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons (beginning with &quot;From Hare to Heir&quot; 1960) carried the legend &quot;A Vitaphone Release&quot;. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; of the same period (beginning with that same year&#x27;s &quot;Hopalong Casualty&quot;) were credited as &quot;A Vitagraph Release&quot;. By late 1968, the Vitaphone/Vitagraph titles had become interchangeable between the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series titles.

==Legacy==

Vitaphone was among the first 25 inductees into the TECnology Hall of Fame at its establishment in 2004, an honor given to &quot;products and innovations that have had an enduring impact on the development of audio technology.&quot; The award notes that Vitaphone, though short-lived, helped in popularizing theater sound and was critical in stimulating the development of the modern sound reinforcement system.

Though operating on principles so different as to make it unrecognizable to a Vitaphone engineer, DTS is a sound-on-disc system, the first to gain wide adoption since the abandonment of Vitaphone.

<doc id="540852" wikidata="Q7712456" url="?curid=540852" title="The Adventure of the Gold Hunter">
<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Gold Hunter&quot; is a Sherlock Holmes murder mystery by Adrian Conan Doyle (the youngest son of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the Sherlock Holmes creator) and John Dickson Carr. The story was published in the 1954 collection &quot;The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It was first published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on 30 May 1953, illustrated by Robert Fawcett.

== Plot ==
The Reverend James Appley asks Holmes to investigate the sudden and unexpected death of Squire Trelawney of his parish in Somerset. Rev. Appley is concerned because the suspect is his nephew, Dr. Paul Griffin, the attending physician. Trewlaney recently named Griffin his sole beneficiary, disinheriting the previous beneficiary, his niece, Miss Dolores Dale. Miss Dale&#x27;s fiancé, Jeffrey Ainsworth, claims that he saw Trewlaney alive and well until late in the night.

The problem is that no one can determine the cause of death, not even the famous pathologist Sir Leopold Harper, who conducted an autopsy. A clue might lie in the gold hunter, a popular pocket watch, owned by the deceased gentleman. Holmes once more solves the puzzle to the chagrin of Inspector Lestrade.

&quot;And see,&quot; he continued, hastening to the small table in question, &quot;what a treasure–trove we have here! Look at this, Lestrade! Look at it!&quot; 
&quot;But, Holmes, it is only a small pot of vaseline such as you may buy at any chemist&#x27;s!&quot; 
&quot;On the contrary, it is a hangman&#x27;s rope.&quot;

<doc id="540853" wikidata="Q1594352" url="?curid=540853" title="Interception">
<text>In ball-playing competitive team sports, an interception or pick is a move by a player involving a pass of the ball—whether by foot or hand, depending on the rules of the sport—in which the ball is intended for a player of the same team but caught or otherwise brought under control by a player of the opposing team, who thereby usually gains possession of the ball for their team. It is commonly seen in football, including American and Canadian football, as well as association football, rugby league, rugby union, Australian rules football and Gaelic football, as well as any sport by which a loose object is passed between players toward a goal. In basketball, this is called a steal.

==Gridiron football==
In American football and Canadian football, an interception occurs when a forward pass that has not yet touched the ground is caught by a player of the defensive team. This leads to an immediate change of possession during the play, and the defender who caught the ball can immediately attempt to move the ball as far towards the opposing end zone as possible, up to a touchdown. Following the stoppage of play, if the interceptor retained possession of the ball, his team takes over possession at the spot where he was downed. Because possession is a critical component in these sports, a successful interception can be a dramatic reversal of the teams&#x27; fortunes.

Interceptions are predominantly made by the secondary or (on some occasions) the linebackers, who are usually closest to the quarterback&#x27;s intended targets: the wide receivers, running backs, and tight ends. Less frequently, a defensive lineman may get an interception from a tipped ball, a near sack, a shovel pass, or a screen pass, but are more likely to force a fumble than get an interception. As soon as a pass is intercepted, everyone on the defense changes their play to become a blocker, keeping opposing players away while helping the person with the interception get as much yardage as possible and perhaps a touchdown (commonly called a &quot;pick-six&quot;, since a touchdown is worth 6 points); at the same time, everyone on the offense becomes the defense and attempts to tackle the ball-carrier. If the interception occurs on an extra-point attempt, rather than an ordinary play from scrimmage, a return of the interception to the other end zone is sometimes called a &quot;pick-two&quot;, as it is a defensive two-point conversion rather than a touchdown. For example, on December 4, 2016, the Kansas City Chiefs strong safety Eric Berry scored the game-winning points via a pick-two in a 29–28 victory over the Atlanta Falcons. Berry also achieved an ordinary pick-six earlier in the same game.

If the intercepting team has the lead and there is little time left in the game, the intercepting player may down the ball immediately and not attempt to gain any yardage; the team then runs out the clock using scrimmage plays. This eliminates the chance of a fumble that could be recovered by the other team. There are also player safety implications: when the ball is turned over, the play is now suddenly and unexpectedly moving in the opposite direction. All of the players on offense are instantly susceptible to unexpected blocks, even if not attempting to stop the ball carrier; a hard and unseen block can result in severe injuries. Additionally, offensive players, particularly the quarterback, are often inexperienced tacklers and are at risk of injuring themselves while tackling the ball carrier.

Only the interception of a forward pass is recorded statistically as an interception, for both the passer and the intercepting player. If a receiver fails to catch the ball and bobbles or tips it before it is intercepted, even if his action was entirely responsible for the interception, it is always recorded as an interception thrown by the passer. The interception of a lateral pass is recorded as a fumble by the passer.

===Notable players===
====Canadian Football League====

In an 11-year CFL career, Less Browne recorded 87 interceptions during the 1980s and 90s, which is both a CFL and all-pro record. He was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame (CFHF) in 2002.

Barron Miles, a defensive back in the early 2000s for the BC Lions and Montreal Alouettes, recorded 66 interceptions, tied for second all-time, in a 12-year CFL career. He is also the all-time leader in blocked kicks with 13. He was inducted into the CFHF in 2018.

Larry Highbaugh played for the BC Lions and Edmonton Eskimos during the 1970s and early 1980s, winning six Grey Cups and recording 66 interceptions in his career. At the time of his retirement he was the all-time leader in interceptions. He was inducted into the CFHF in 2004.

In a game against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in 1990, Rod Hill of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers caught five interceptions, a CFL record for a regular-season game. Canadian and Pro Football Hall of Famer Bud Grant of the Blue Bombers, holds the record for most interceptions in a playoff game, also with five, which he accomplished in a game against the Saskatchewan Roughriders in 1953.

Quarterback Danny McManus has the record for most interceptions thrown in a CFL career with 281. Damon Allen is a close second with 278 interceptions thrown.

====National Football League====
Lester Hayes of the Oakland Raiders was one of the National Football League&#x27;s (NFL) leaders at interceptions in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He was known for covering his chest, shoulders and forearms with a copious amount of the adhesive Stickum to help him hold on to the ball. After the NFL outlawed the use of such foreign substances in 1981, Hayes&#x27; success rate at interceptions dropped below average though that could be due to his reputation as a &quot;shutdown cornerback&quot;, which discouraged opposing teams from throwing to his side of the field. He continued to use the substance, which he called &quot;pick juice&quot;, by having it applied in smaller amounts to his wrists.

Paul Krause holds the record for most career interceptions with 81. He played his first three years in the NFL from 1964 to 1967 with the Washington Redskins but was traded to the Minnesota Vikings, where he spent most of his career. Krause played until 1979 and appeared in four Super Bowls with the Vikings. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1998.

Dick &quot;Night Train&quot; Lane holds the record for most interceptions in a season with 14, which he set in his rookie season in 1952.

Rod Woodson played 16 seasons with Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Baltimore, and Oakland, and holds the NFL record for most interception returns for touchdown in an NFL career with 12. Also, he holds the NFL record for most total defensive touchdown returns in a career with 13. Woodson, who is third on the NFL all-time career interception list with 71, was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2009.

Darren Sharper, a safety that played from 1997 to 2010, has a career total of 63 interceptions, and has returned 11 of those for touchdowns. Sharper holds the NFL record for interception return yardage in a single season with 376 yards in 2009. He is also tied with Rod Woodson for most total defensive touchdown returns career with 13.

Charles Woodson, formerly with the Green Bay Packers and Oakland Raiders has 65 career interceptions and tied Rod Woodson for most defensive touchdowns with 13. Woodson and Sharper are tied for second all time in interceptions returned for touchdowns with 11.

Ty Law, formerly of the New England Patriots, New York Jets, and Kansas City Chiefs, has 52 career interceptions. Champ Bailey, who played for the Washington Redskins and Denver Broncos, had 10 interceptions in 2006 and has a career total of 52. Strong safety Sammy Knight had 42 interceptions in his career.

Ed Reed holds the record for the longest interception return, 107 yards against the Philadelphia Eagles on November 23, 2008. Reed also holds the record for the second longest interception return, 106 yards against the Cleveland Browns on November 7, 2004. During both games he played for the Baltimore Ravens. Reed also has a total of 64 interceptions and holds the record for the most interception return yardage in NFL history (1,541).

Brett Favre holds the record for most career interceptions thrown: 336. Favre&#x27;s first pass in an NFL regular season game resulted in an interception returned for a touchdown. Favre&#x27;s last pass as a Green Bay Packer was an interception as well, thrown to Corey Webster of the New York Giants in the 2007 NFC Championship Game to lose the game. In the 2009 NFC Championship Game, with his Minnesota Vikings almost within range of a potential game-winning field goal in the last few minutes of regulation, Favre threw an interception to Tracy Porter, and the New Orleans Saints would end up winning in overtime.

Rodney Harrison of the New England Patriots and San Diego Chargers was the first player in NFL history to have 30 interceptions and 30 sacks over the course of his career. He set that historic benchmark on October 21, 2007. The Baltimore Ravens&#x27; Ray Lewis was the second to accomplish this feat. He recorded his 30th interception November 21, 2010, intercepting the Carolina Panthers&#x27; Brian St. Pierre and returning the ball for a touchdown. Lewis is also the only member of the 40/30 club (at least 40 sacks and at least 30 interceptions).

On November 21, 2010, Ronde Barber became the only player in NFL history with at least 25 sacks (26 total) and 40 interceptions. His jersey and gloves from the game were subsequently retired to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton.

Asante Samuel Sr., of the Atlanta Falcons, with 4 postseason interception returns for touchdowns, is the NFL&#x27;s all-time leader.

James Harrison of the Pittsburgh Steelers set the record for the longest interception return for a touchdown in a Super Bowl in Super Bowl XLIII. The NFL&#x27;s Defensive Player of the Year Harrison picked off Kurt Warner&#x27;s pass and returned it a Super Bowl-record 100 yards for a touchdown on the final play of the first half to give the Pittsburgh Steelers a 17–7 lead over the Arizona Cardinals.

Aaron Rodgers holds the record for the most consecutive pass attempts without an interception with 402 during the 2018 NFL season. He only threw two interceptions that entire season. On December 26, 2010, Brady overtook the previous record of 308 consecutive completed passes without an interception, held by Bernie Kosar of the Cleveland Browns since 1991. Kosar&#x27;s regular-season streak of pass attempts without an interception ended on November 10, 1991, against the Philadelphia Eagles.

On October 6, 2013, Matt Schaub became the first quarterback to throw a &quot;pick-six&quot; (an interception returned for a touchdown) in four consecutive games, while playing against the San Francisco 49ers.

In Super Bowl XLIX, New England Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler intercepted a would-be go-ahead touchdown pass from Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson at the goal line in the final seconds of the game, allowing the Patriots to win what would have been an otherwise near-certain defeat. The significance of this play led it to be dubbed by many as simply &quot;The Interception&quot;.

In 2019, despite having a career high and league-leading 5,000 yards passing, Jameis Winston of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers threw for a total of 30 interceptions, the most interceptions in the league since Vinny Testaverde&#x27;s 35 in 1988, giving Winston a career total of 87 interceptions at the season&#x27;s end. Winston&#x27;s season high came on October 13 against the Carolina Panthers, when he recorded a total of five interceptions. Winston&#x27;s seven pick-6s in that season set an NFL record, and his last interception, a pick-six to the Atlanta Falcons to lose the game in overtime, made him the only quarterback to ever throw at least 30 touchdowns along with 30 interceptions in a season. Winston&#x27;s penchant for turnovers (both interceptions and fumbles), including six interceptions across the last two regular season games that were losses, led to him not being re-signed by the Buccaneers.

C. J Stroud holds the record for the most consecutive pass attempts without an interception to start a career, with 191. He made the record with the Houston Texans during his rookie 2023 NFL season, throwing his first interception in week 5. The previous record was 177, made by Dak Prescott in the 2016 season.

====BAFA National Leagues====
Robert Hardwick of the Nottingham Caesars of the BAFA National Leagues scored a game-winning touchdown against the Birmingham Bulls on May 15, 2016. The Bulls were three points up at the four-yard line with 14 seconds left on the clock, and elected to throw a pass which was intercepted and run 100 yards to the opposite end zone.
== Rugby ==
Because of the relatively strict offside law in both codes of rugby, and the requirement that all passes be backward, interceptions are difficult to achieve. However, when they occur, the side who loses possession is suddenly out of formation to defend, and the interceptor may be able to sprint down the field for a spectacular try.

<doc id="540869" wikidata="Q282003" url="?curid=540869" title="Lindane">
<text>Lindane, also known as &quot;gamma&quot;-hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH), gammaxene, Gammallin and benzene hexachloride (BHC), is an organochlorine chemical and an isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane that has been used both as an agricultural insecticide and as a pharmaceutical treatment for lice and scabies.

Lindane is a neurotoxin that interferes with GABA neurotransmitter function by interacting with the GABAA receptor-chloride channel complex at the picrotoxin binding site. In humans, lindane affects the nervous system, liver, and kidneys, and may well be a carcinogen. Whether lindane is an endocrine disruptor is unclear.

The World Health Organization classifies lindane as &quot;moderately hazardous&quot;, and its international trade is restricted and regulated under the Rotterdam Convention on Prior Informed Consent. In 2009, the production and agricultural use of lindane was banned under the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants. A specific exemption to that ban allows it to continue to be used as a second-line pharmaceutical treatment for lice and scabies.

==History and use==
The chemical was originally synthesized in 1825 by Faraday. It is named after the Dutch chemist Teunis van der Linden (1884–1965), the first to isolate and describe γ-hexachlorcyclohexane in 1912. The fact that mixtures of isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane have insecticidal activity is a case of multiple discovery. Work in the 1930s at the Jealott&#x27;s Hill laboratories of Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd (ICI) led in 1942 to the realization that the γ isomer was the key active component in the mixture which had hitherto been tested. Development work in the UK was accelerated because at that time in World War II imports of derris containing the insecticide rotenone were restricted owing to the Japanese occupation of Malaya and alternatives were urgently needed. In trials in 1943 it was found that a five-fold increase in the yield of oats and wheat was achieved using a dust formulation of the available material, owing to its efficacy against wireworm pests. By the end of 1945, γ-hexachlorcyclohexane of 98% purity became available and ICI commercialised a seed treatment launched in 1949 as Mergamma A, containing 1% mercury and 20% lindane. Subsequently, lindane has been used to treat food crops and forestry products, as a seed or soil treatment, and to treat livestock and pets. It was used as a household pesticide as the active pesticide ingredient of an insecticidal floor wax product called &quot;Freewax&quot;. It has also been used as pharmaceutical treatment for lice and scabies, formulated as a shampoo or lotion. Between 1950 and 2000, an estimated 600,000 tonnes of lindane were produced globally, and the vast majority of which was used in agriculture. It has been manufactured by several countries, including the United States, China, Brazil, and several European countries.
By November 2006, the use of lindane had been banned in 52 countries and restricted in 33 others. Seventeen countries, including the US and Canada, allowed either limited agricultural or pharmaceutical use. In 2009, an international ban on the use of lindane in agriculture was implemented under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. A specific exemption allows for it to continue to be used in second-line treatments for the head lice and scabies for five more years. The production of the lindane isomers α- and β-hexachlorocyclohexane was also banned. Although the US has not ratified the convention, it has similarly banned agricultural uses while still allowing its use as a second-line lice and scabies treatment.

===United States===
In the US, lindane pesticide products were regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), while lindane medications are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It was registered as an agricultural insecticide in the 1940s, and as pharmaceutical in 1951. The EPA gradually began restricting its agricultural use in the 1970s due to concerns over its effects on human health and the environment. By 2002, its use was limited to seed treatments for just six crops, and in 2007, these last uses were cancelled.

====Pharmaceutical uses====
Lindane medications continue to be available in the US, though since 1995, they have been designated &quot;second-line&quot; treatments, meaning they should be prescribed when other &quot;first-line&quot; treatments have failed or cannot be used. In December 2007, the FDA sent a Warning Letter to Morton Grove Pharmaceuticals, the sole U.S. manufacturer of lindane products, requesting that the company correct misleading information on two of its lindane websites. The letter said, in part, that the materials &quot;are misleading in that they omit and/or minimize the most serious and important risk information associated with the use of Lindane Shampoo, particularly in pediatric patients; include a misleading dosing claim; and overstate the efficacy of Lindane Shampoo.&quot;

California banned the pharmaceutical lindane, effective 2002, and the Michigan House of Representatives passed a bill in 2009 to restrict its use to doctors&#x27; offices. A recent analysis of the California ban concluded that a majority of pediatricians had not experienced problems treating lice or scabies since that ban took effect. The study also documented a marked decrease in lindane wastewater contamination and a dramatic decline in lindane poisoning incidents reported to poison control centers. The authors concluded, &quot;The California experience suggests elimination of pharmaceutical lindane produced environmental benefits, was associated with a reduction in reported unintentional exposures and did not adversely affect head lice and scabies treatment.&quot;

The Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants considers the use of lindane in agriculture as largely redundant, with other, less toxic and less persistent pesticides. In the case of pharmaceutical use, the committee noted, &quot;alternatives for pharmaceutical uses have often failed for scabies and lice treatment and the number of available alternative products for this use is scarce. For this particular case, a reasonable alternative would be to use lindane as a second-line treatment when other treatments fail, while potential new treatments are assessed.&quot;

==Other uses==
===Pest repellent===
Lindane is a bird repellent. Rudd &amp; Genelly 1954 noticed that bird pests seemed uninterested in treated seeds, specifically pheasants and blackbirds around Davis, CA, US. They tested its repellent effect on pheasants and found it effective, speculating that it may be usable as a general bird repellent.

==Synthesis==
Lindane is not known to occur naturally.
Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) was discovered in 1825. Its insecticidal properties were not known until the 1940s. Technical grade HCH, as a mixture of isomers is synthesized from benzene and chlorine in presence of ultraviolet light. The resulting product mixture comprises 65-70% α-HCH, 7-10% β-HCH, 14-15% lindane (γ-HCH), approximately 7% δ-HCH, 1-2% ε-HCH, and 1-2% other components.

It can also be prepared by exposing a mixture of benzene and chlorine to alpha radiation.

==Human health effects==
The EPA and WHO both classify lindane as &quot;moderately&quot; acutely toxic. It has an oral of 88 mg/kg in rats and a dermal LD50 of 1000 mg/kg. Most of the adverse human health effects reported for lindane have been related to agricultural uses and chronic, occupational exposure of seed-treatment workers.

Exposure to large amounts of lindane can harm the nervous system, producing a range of symptoms from headache and dizziness to seizures, convulsions, and more rarely, death. Lindane has not been shown to affect the immune system in humans, and it is not considered to be genotoxic. Prenatal exposure to β-HCH, an isomer of lindane and production byproduct, has been associated with altered thyroid hormone levels and could affect brain development.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have set occupational exposure limits (permissible exposure and recommended exposure, respectively) for lindane at 0.5 mg/m3 at a time-weighted average of eight hours for skin exposure. People can be exposed to lindane in the workplace by inhaling it, absorbing it through their skin, swallowing it, and eye contact. At levels of 50 mg/m3, lindane is immediately dangerous to life and health.

It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.

===Cancer risk===
Based primarily on evidence from animal studies, most evaluations of lindane have concluded that it may possibly cause cancer. In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified lindane as a known human carcinogen, and in 2001 the EPA concluded there was &quot;suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity, but not sufficient to assess human carcinogenic potential.&quot; The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services determined that all isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane, including lindane, &quot;may reasonably be anticipated to cause cancer in humans,&quot; and in 1999, the EPA characterized the evidence carcinogenicity for lindane as &quot;suggestive ... of carcinogenicity, but not sufficient to assess human carcinogenic potential.&quot; Lindane and its isomers have also been on California&#x27;s Proposition 65 list of known carcinogens since 1989. In contrast, the World Health Organization concluded in 2004 that &quot;lindane is not likely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans.&quot; India&#x27;s BIS considers Lindane a &quot;confirmed carcinogen&quot;.

===Adverse reactions===
A variety of adverse reactions to lindane pharmaceuticals have been reported, ranging from skin irritation to seizures, and, in rare instances, death. The most common side effects are burning sensations, itching, dryness, and rash. While serious effects are rare and have most often resulted from misuse, adverse reactions have occurred when used properly. The FDA, therefore, requires a so-called black box warning on lindane products, which explains the risks of lindane products and their proper use.

The black box warning emphasizes that lindane should not be used on premature infants and individuals with known uncontrolled seizure disorders, and should be used with caution in infants, children, the elderly, and individuals with other skin conditions (e.g., dermatitis, psoriasis) and people who weigh less than , as they may be at risk of serious neurotoxicity.

==Environmental contamination==
Lindane is a persistent organic pollutant: it is relatively long-lived in the environment, it is transported long distances by natural processes like global distillation, and it can bioaccumulate in food chains, though it is rapidly eliminated when exposure is discontinued.

The production and agricultural use of lindane are the primary causes of environmental contamination, and levels of lindane in the environment have been decreasing in the U.S., consistent with decreasing agricultural usage patterns. The production of lindane generates large amounts of waste hexachlorocyclohexane isomers, and &quot;every ton of lindane manufactured produces about nine tons of toxic waste.&quot; Modern manufacturing standards for lindane involve the treatment and conversion of waste isomers to less toxic molecules, a process known as &quot;cracking&quot;.

When lindane is used in agriculture, an estimated 12–30% of it volatilizes into the atmosphere, where it is subject to long-range transport and can be deposited by rainfall. Lindane in soil can leach to surface and even ground water, and can bioaccumulate in the food chain. However, biotransformation and elimination are relatively rapid when exposure is discontinued. Most exposure of the general population to lindane has resulted from agricultural uses and the intake of foods, such as produce, meats, and milk, produced from treated agricultural commodities. Human exposure has decreased significantly since the cancellation of agricultural uses in 2006. Even so, the CDC published in 2005 its Third National Report on Human Exposures to Environmental Chemicals, which found no detectable amounts of lindane in human blood taken from a random sampling of about 5,000 people in the US as part of the NHANES study (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The lack of detection of lindane in this large human &quot;biomonitoring&quot; study likely reflects the increasingly limited agricultural uses of lindane over the last two decades. The cancellation of agricultural uses in the United States will further reduce the amount of lindane introduced into the environment by more than 99%.

Over time, lindane is broken down in soil, sediment, and water into less harmful substances by algae, fungi, and bacteria; however, the process is relatively slow and dependent on ambient environmental conditions. Lindane residues in honey and beeswax are reported to be the highest of any historical or current pesticide and to continue to pose a threat to honeybee health. The ecological impact of lindane&#x27;s environmental persistence continues to be debated.

The US EPA determined in 2002 that the agency does not believe that lindane contaminates drinking water in excess of levels considered safe. U.S. Geological Survey teams concluded the same in 1999 and 2000. With regard to lindane medications, the EPA conducted &quot;down-the-drain&quot; estimates of the amount of lindane reaching public water supplies and concluded that lindane levels from pharmaceutical sources were &quot;extremely low&quot; and not of concern.

Note that the EPA has set the maximum contaminant level or &quot;MCL&quot; for lindane allowed in public water supplies and considered safe for drinking at 200 parts per trillion (ppt). By comparison, the state of California imposes a lower MCL for lindane of 19 ppt. However, the California standard is based on a dated 1988 national water criterion that was subsequently revised by the EPA in 2003 to 980 ppt. The EPA stated that the change resulted from &quot;significant scientific advances made in the last two decades particularly in the areas of cancer and noncancer risk assessments.&quot; While the EPA considered raising the MCL standard for lindane to 980 ppt at that time, the change was never implemented because states had little difficulty in maintaining lindane levels below the 200 ppt MCL limit already in place. Today, the legally enforceable MCL standard for lindane is 200 ppt, while the national water criterion for lindane is 980 ppt.

===Isomers===
Lindane is the gamma isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane (&quot;γ-HCH&quot;). In addition to the issue of lindane pollution, some concerns are related to the other isomers of HCH, namely alpha-HCH and beta-HCH, which are notably more toxic than lindane, lack its insecticidal properties, and are byproducts of lindane production. In the 1940s and 1950s, lindane producers stockpiled these isomers in open heaps, which led to ground and water contamination. The International HCH and Pesticide Forum has since been established to bring together experts to address the clean-up and containment of these sites. Modern manufacturing standards for lindane involve the treatment and conversion of waste isomers to less toxic industrial chemicals, a process known as &quot;cracking&quot;. Today, only a few production plants remain active worldwide to accommodate public-health uses of lindane and declining agricultural needs. Lindane has not been manufactured in the U.S. since the mid-1970s, but continues to be imported.

<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Two Women&quot; is a Sherlock Holmes crime story by Adrian Conan Doyle, the youngest son of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the Sherlock Holmes creator. The story was published in the 1954 collection &quot;The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It was first published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on 4 September 1953, and was illustrated by Robert Fawcett in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;.

== Plot ==
Holmes is called upon to save the widow of a distinguished family from shame. Her noble husband, Henry Gladsdale, the late Duke of Carringford served his country well, but now the Duchess Carringford and her betrothed daughter, Lady Mary Gladsdale, are facing ruin. A blackmailer threatens to expose a prior marriage by Henry Gladsdale that would nullify his marriage to the current Duchess. The price for silence is Gladsdale&#x27;s private papers, which undoubtedly contain information valuable to foreign powers.

Holmes must fend off the threats of a thug, discover the identity of the blackmailer, and commit a crime himself before he resolves the extortion plot.

<doc id="540877" wikidata="Q1854464" url="?curid=540877" title="Quarterback sack">
<text>In gridiron football, a sack occurs when the quarterback (or another offensive player acting as a passer) is tackled behind the line of scrimmage before throwing a forward pass, when the quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage in the &quot;pocket&quot; and without clear intent, or when a passer runs out of bounds behind the line of scrimmage due to defensive pressure. This often occurs if the opposing team&#x27;s defensive line, linebackers or defensive backs are able to apply pass pressure (also called a [[pass rush]]) to quickly get past blocking players of the offensive team (the quarterback&#x27;s protection), or if the quarterback is unable to find a back to hand the ball off to or an available eligible receiver (including wide receivers, running backs and tight ends) to catch the ball, allowing the defense a longer opportunity to tackle the quarterback. 

Performing a sack is advantageous for the defending team as the offense loses a down, and the line of scrimmage retreats several yards. Even better for the defense is a sack causing the quarterback to fumble the ball at or behind the line of scrimmage; this is also known as a strip sack and can result in a turnover if the defense manages to obtain the ball. A quarterback who is pressured but avoids a sack can still be adversely affected by being forced to hurry.

The quarterback must pass the statistical line of scrimmage to avoid the sack. If a passer is sacked in his own end zone, the result is a safety and the defending team is awarded two points. If the football is fumbled and recovered either inside the end zone by the defense, or outside the end zone and is returned to the end zone this results in a touchdown for the defense.

==Statistical record rules==

To be considered a sack, the quarterback must intend to throw a forward pass. If the play is designed for the quarterback to rush (run) the ball, any loss is subtracted from the quarterback&#x27;s rushing total (and the play is ruled a tackle for loss as opposed to a sack). If the quarterback&#x27;s intent is not obvious, statisticians use certain criteria, such as the offensive line blocking scheme, to decide. Unique situations where a loss reduces a quarterback&#x27;s rushing total (not a sack) are &quot;kneel downs&quot; (used to run time off the game clock).

A player will receive credit for half of a sack when multiple players contribute to the sacking of a quarterback, even if more than two players contributed.

In the National Football League (NFL), it is possible to record a sack for zero yards. The NFL subtracts yards lost due to sacks from teams&#x27; passing totals (though the quarterback&#x27;s individual passing total stats remain unchanged), while the NCAA subtracts sack yardage from individual rushing totals.

==History==
The term &quot;sack&quot; was first popularized in the 1960s by Hall of Fame defensive end Deacon Jones, who felt that a quarterback being sacked devastated the offense in the same way that a city was devastated when it was sacked. In 1999, Jones provided a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reporter with some other detailed imagery about his forte: &quot;You take all the offensive linemen and put them in a burlap bag, and then you take a baseball bat and beat on the bag. You&#x27;re sacking them, you&#x27;re bagging them. And that’s what you&#x27;re doing with a quarterback.&quot;

According to former NFL coach Marv Levy, Washington Redskins coach George Allen may have coined the term when referring to Dallas Cowboys quarterback Craig Morton when he purportedly stated before a game, &quot;Before we play those Dallas Cowboys, we’re going to take that Morton salt and pour him into a sack.&quot;

Prior to &quot;sack&quot;, the term &quot;dump&quot; was often used, as the NFL&#x27;s statistical office recorded all sacks under &quot;dumping the passer&quot;.

The NFL only began to keep track of times passers lost yardage in 1961 and no credit was given to the defensive player responsible until 1982. Researcher John Turney of the Pro Football Researchers Association estimated that Jones recorded 173½ sacks in his career.

Controversial NFL rule changes made for the 2018 season prohibit tacklers from landing on the quarterback after making a sack, with the punishment being a roughing the passer penalty.

==Pass pressure==

Of all forms of defensive pressure against the opposition&#x27;s passer, sacks provide the most immediate impact by ending the offensive play. However, quarterbacks sometimes avoid a sack by throwing an incomplete pass or risking an interception. According to Football Outsiders, a quarterback hurry is the most common form of pass pressure. In the 2009 NFL season, there were 1,106 sacks and 3,268 hurries, and a hurried quarterback generally averaged fewer yards per pass play compared to the average pass play.

<text>The Pontiac Catalina is a full-size automobile produced by Pontiac from 1950 to 1981. Initially, the name was a trim line on hardtop body styles, first appearing in the 1950 Chieftain Eight and DeLuxe Eight lines. In 1959, it became a separate model as the &quot;entry-level&quot; full-size Pontiac.

The Catalina was Pontiac&#x27;s most popular model, available in multiple body styles, and served as the donor platform for the popular Pontiac Grand Prix, Pontiac 2+2, Pontiac Ventura, and the Pontiac Safari station wagon.

When the second-generation Pontiac Tempest was introduced in 1964, lessons learned from the Catalina&#x27;s introduction of the Grand Prix led to the introduction of the Pontiac GTO, to include the Pontiac V8.


==As a trim level (1950–1958)==

The name &quot;Catalina&quot; was first used on the 1950 Chieftain Series 25/27 hardtop, Pontiac&#x27;s top trim level package at the time, and later added to the Star Chief in 1954, Pontiac&#x27;s equivalent of the Chevrolet Bel Air. Originally referred to as &quot;hard-top convertibles&quot;, these vehicles offered pillarless design in the door and window areas, along with the top-grade convertible appointments. The advantage this fixed-roof design offered is its sporty, airy feeling without the expense and drawbacks normally associated with convertibles. With the exception of the 1958 Bonneville, all Pontiac hardtops were designated &quot;Catalinas&quot; from 1950 to 1958. Powered by a flathead straight-eight engine at the time of its debut, it would receive Pontiac&#x27;s new OHV Pontiac V8 four years later. A one-piece windshield was new for 1954. A padded safety dash became available in 1956. The names &quot;Catalina&quot; and &quot;Bel Air&quot; are upscale communities in Southern California, United States.


==As a stand-alone model==
===1959–1960===

For 1959, Pontiac dropped the name &quot;Chieftain&quot; and &quot;Super Chief&quot; models for its junior-level series and renamed it &quot;Catalina&quot;, while demoting the former top-line Star Chief to intermediate status eliminating the two door Star Chief Catalina, the only hardtop for the Star Chief was the four door hardtop and expanding the Bonneville nameplate to a senior series that included sedans, coupes, convertibles and Safari station wagons.

In the lower-priced Catalina line, Pontiac division advertising placed higher emphasis on the top trimmed two- and four-door hardtops, convertible and Safari station wagons instead of the pillared two- and four-door sedan variants despite the fact that the four-door sedan was the best seller in this line.

The Catalina, though it was the lowest-priced full-sized Pontiac, was priced and trimmed below the Chevrolet Impala due to GM&#x27;s overlapping price structure formula only a step below the Buick LeSabre and Oldsmobile 88 in trim and appointments but priced about $100 to $200 less. Catalinas also came standard with more amenities than Chevrolet models and included a larger and more powerful V8 engine of 389 cubic inches, compared to the Chevy&#x27;s six-cylinder or 283 and 348 cubic-inch V8s. Pontiacs also benefited from a much better automatic transmission than their Chevrolet counterparts - the four-speed Hydra-Matic - versus the Chevy&#x27;s two-speed Powerglide.

Though the basic Catalina started out with a full rubber mat, it could be ordered with full carpeting, glovebox and trunk lights; dual front ashtrays, cigar lighter, glove compartment snack bar (two cup indents on the glovebox door that could be opened for use at drive-in restaurants) were standard, heater-defroster and a choice of cloth and Morrokide vinyl upholstery or expanded Morrokide (all-vinyl trim) optional. Pontiac buyers could add even more trimmings for a few dollars more by ordering the &quot;decor group&quot; which added full wheel covers, deluxe steering wheel, chrome pedal trim plates and more. Also offered from 1962 to 1970 on most Catalina models was the Ventura custom interior (which was a separate model from 1960 to 1961), which included the interior and exterior upgrades offered with the extra-cost decor group option plus a slightly more luxurious interior of cloth or Morrokide trims similar to the costlier Pontiac Star Chief or Executive depending on the year.

Catalinas and other 1959 Pontiacs were completely restyled on a new General Motors B-body that was shared by all GM divisions from Chevrolet to Cadillac, replacing the previous A-body utilized for Pontiacs and Chevrolets that was used only for 1958. Twin tailfins, two on each side, were new and only in 1959. Styling highlights include thin-pillar rooflines and greater use of glass for increased visibility. Pillared four-door sedans feature six-window styling, while two-door hardtops were dubbed &quot;bubbletops&quot; due to the large wraparound bubble windshield and thin c-pillar and large rear window; four-door hardtops featured flat-blade rooflines with an overhang past the rear window. Wheelbases were 122&quot; for Catalina and 124&quot; for Star Chief and Bonneville inches, but overall length on Catalina was 7&quot; shorter than Bonneville and Star Chief at .
The 1959 Pontiacs featured a &quot;split grille&quot;, which came about by accident when the styling studio was exploring grille design. Experimentally, a design for a conventional, full width, oval grille, containing horizontal quad headlights, was cut in two and the halves transposed. With the lights remaining at the extremities, this gave the split center, open ended look of the &#x27;59 Catalina. Along with the wider body came a 5&quot; wider chassis in which the wheels were moved out towards the fenders. This not only improved the appearance of the car but led to improvements in ride and handling - spawning the term &quot;wide track&quot; ride and handling which Pontiac would use in its promotional efforts for many years to come.

All Pontiacs were powered by various renditions of the new 389 cubic-inch Tempest V8 (which was later renamed from 1961 as the Trophy V-8), which was basically a version of the previous 370 cubic-inch V8 with stroke increased to 3.75 inches (the 370ci was used in 1958-model Pontiacs and based on the Pontiac V8 design introduced in 1955). Catalinas came standard with a version of the 389 with two-barrel carburetor and 8.6 to 1 compression mated to the three-speed manual transmission. When the optional four-speed Hydramatic transmission was ordered, the standard engine was version of the same engine with higher 10.5 to 1 compression ratio. Available as a no-cost option with the Hydramatic transmission was the 215-horsepower 389 (dubbed the Economy V8) with 8.6 to 1 compression ratio which burned cheaper regular gasoline, instead of the premium and super-premium fuels required for the high-compression engines, and capable of achieving more than 20 MPG on the highway. Optionally available at extra cost were higher-power versions of the 389 V8 with four-barrel carburetion rated at with manual gearbox or 303 hp with Hydramatic, a 4-barrel carburetor version with a horsepower rating of 318 hp, or &quot;Tri-Power&quot; options with triple two-barrel carburetors and 330 hp or .

For 1960, Catalina and other Pontiacs received a minor facelifting of the &#x27;59 bodyshell with a new full-width horizontal bar grille similar to the 1930s Cord 810/812 replacing 1959&#x27;s split grille (for this year only-the split grille returned in 1961) and round taillights. Bodystyles and drivetrain offerings were unchanged from 1959. New to the option list was a &quot;Sportable Transistor&quot; radio that could be used in the car in place of the regular &quot;in-dash&quot; radio or removed from the car for use as a portable with battery power, and the upgraded trim package as a two-door or four door hardtop called the Pontiac Ventura. Also new for 1960 were the optional &quot;Al-Fin&quot; eight lug-nut aluminum wheels with integral brake drums that not only enhanced the car&#x27;s looks but also provided improved stopping power. Another popular option for performance enthusiasts was the &quot;Safe-T-Track&quot; limited slip differential. In the suspension department the front track was increased from the 59&#x27;s to . In the engine compartment the so-called &quot;gusher type&quot; cooling system (with cooling liquid entering the engine over the exhaust valves, reverse of what is more normally done) was replaced by the so-called &quot;Equa-flow&quot; type (with conventional V-8 cooling configuration). Turn signals were standard, while the A/C was $430 and padded dash was $19.

Inside, a revised instrument panel featured a new horizontal sweep speedometer along with minor changes in trim patterns.
===1961–1964===

The 1961 full-sized Pontiacs were completely restyled with more squared-off bodylines, the reintroduction of the split grille first seen in 1959 and dropped for 1960 and an all-new Torque-Box perimeter frame with side rails replacing the &quot;X&quot; frame chassis used since 1958. The new frame not only provides greater side-impact protection than the &quot;X&quot; design but also improves interior roominess.

The distinctive protruding grille made its appearance on all Pontiac products during the early 1960s, and was a modern revival of a similar appearance on Pontiac products during the 1930s and early 1940s, as demonstrated on the Pontiac Torpedo.

Rooflines are more squared off on four-door models with the six-window styling dropped on pillared sedans and wider C-pillars with flat rear windows on four-door hardtops. A revised version of the 1959-60 &quot;bubbletop&quot; roof was used on two-door hardtops. Wrap-around windshields were dropped in favor of flatter glasswork for improved entry and exit to the front seat.

The new body is somewhat smaller and lighter than the 1960 model with the wheelbase down three inches (76 mm) to 119, overall length reduced by the same to and width dropping nearly two inches to 78.2 from 1960. The front and rear track of the 1961-62 Pontiac was reduced to front and rear. The 1961 Pontiac was advertised as &quot;all Pontiac...on a new wide track.&quot;

All engines were again V8s as in previous years, now called &quot;Trophy&quot; engines. rather than &quot;Tempest&quot; (including the larger 421ci &quot;big bore&quot; engine). Standard engines are two-barrel units rated at with the three-speed manual transmission or with the optional Hydramatic, with a regular-fuel-capable &quot;economy&quot; V8 offered as a no-cost option with the Hydramatic. Offered as extra-cost options were more powerful versions of the 389 including a version with a four-barrel carburetor or Tri-Power option. New to the options list were two higher performance versions of the 389, including a four-barrel unit and a Tri-Power option, both with higher, 10.75:1, compression ratios. A engine was offered to drag racers. Late in the 1961 sales season the Super Duty was released for sale as a dealer installed engine. The 1961 models never came from the assembly line with the 421ci engine; instead it was a specialty item installed and sold at the discretion of individual dealers.

A new &quot;three-speed four-range&quot; &quot;Roto Hydramatic&quot; automatic transmission replaced the previous four-speed unit for 1961. The new transmission is slimmer and lighter than the older four-speed Hydramatic, which was continued on the larger Star Chief and Bonneville models. Also new for 1961 was a four-speed manual transmission with Hurst floor shifter, available on special order.

The 1962 Pontiacs received a heavy facelift from the 1961 design with more rounded body contours and new rooflines on two-door hardtops featuring convertible-like bows. Catalina sedans and coupes got a wheelbase increase to 120&quot;, after spending 1961 on a length shared with full-sized Chevys (Safari wagons retained the wheelbase through 1964). 1962 also saw the introduction of the Grand Prix, a sporty version of the Catalina hardtop coupe.

Most regular engine and transmission offerings were carried over from 1961 with the Trophy V8, ranging in power ratings from to . A small number of 1962 Catalinas and other Pontiacs were built with a &quot;non-streetable&quot; Super Duty V8 with two four-barrel carburetors and , as a US$2,250 option (when the base Catalina listed at US$2,725), along with various &quot;over the counter&quot; performance options offered by Pontiac including aluminum bumpers and even lighter frames with drilled holes (which were dubbed the &quot;Swiss cheese&quot; frames).

For 1963, Catalinas and other full-sized Pontiacs featured cleaner, squared-off bodylines and vertical headlights flanking the split grille, but retained the same dimensions and basic bodyshell of 1961-62 models except for the rear flanks of the new coke bottle styling and due to this styling the rear track was extended to the 59 and 60 Pontiac&#x27;s 64&quot; wide track. Engine offerings were revised as the and versions of the 389 V8 were dropped in favor of &quot;production&quot; versions of the larger rated at with four-barrel carburetor, with Tri-Power, or a &quot;HO&quot; with Tri-Power . The Super Duty 421 was still offered to racing teams during the early portion of the model year but discontinued after General Motors ordered Pontiac (and Chevrolet) to &quot;cease and desist&quot; from factory-supported racing efforts in February 1963. New options for 1963 included a tilt steering wheel that could be adjusted to six different positions, AM/FM radio and cruise control.

The 1963 Grand Prix got a brand new body with a unique roofline along with unique front and rear end styling. Although still based on the Catalina, the GP looked much larger, more powerful and more luxurious, sharing its content with the longer Bonneville. It featured sumptuous &quot;Morrokide&quot; bucket seats and a chrome-trimmed center console with floor shifter for the optional Hydra-Matic or 4-speed manual transmissions.

A 1963 Catalina convertible modified by California hot-rodder Bill Straub was used as a tow vehicle in the NASA M2-F1 program.
Mild facelifting including new grilles and taillights highlighted the 1964 full-sized Pontiacs. Engine and transmission offerings were unchanged from 1963 except for a new GM-built Muncie four-speed manual replacing the Borg-Warner T-10 unit. Also new for 1964, was the Pontiac 2+2 option package available on Catalina two-door hardtops and convertibles that included bucket seats for both front and rear passengers, heavy-duty suspension and other performance equipment, along with the same selection of and V8s found in other Catalinas. The 64 2+2 was a $291 ($ in dollars ) trim option only with the same standard engine as the base Catalina which was listed at $2,869 ($ in dollars ). It was only until 1965 that the 421 engine became the standard engine on the 2+2.

Throughout most of the 1960s when Pontiac annually captured third place in industry sales, behind Chevrolet and Ford, the Catalina was also often the industry&#x27;s third best-selling full-sized car behind the first-place Chevrolet Impala and second-place Ford Galaxie 500. The Catalina&#x27;s success in the low-medium priced field led many competitors to respond with similar products such as the 1961 Chrysler Newport, a less-expensive Chrysler that was priced lower than base models bearing the Chrysler nameplate in recent previous years; and the 1962 Dodge Custom 880 and 1963 Mercury Monterey, both of which were introduced as full-fledged low-medium priced full-sized cars in size and power that followed unsuccessful efforts by Mercury and Dodge to bring out downsized full-sized cars.

In 1964, even Pontiac&#x27;s mid-priced rivals within General Motors responded to the Catalina&#x27;s success in the marketplace as well as to capture Chevy Impala owners &quot;trading up&quot; to cars from upscale GM divisions. Buick took its lowest-priced big car, the LeSabre, and lowered the base sticker price further by substituting a smaller V8 engine and two-speed automatic transmission from its intermediate-sized cars in place of the V8 and three-speed automatic used in other big Buicks. Oldsmobile went even further by creating a whole new full-sized series, the Jetstar 88, which was $75 lower than the Dynamic 88 series (but still a few dollars higher than comparable Pontiac Catalina models) and also got a smaller engine - a V8 and two-speed automatic transmission from the intermediate F-85/Cutlass line, along with smaller brake drums (also from the GM intermediates) compared to the drums still found on all other GM full-sized cars from the bare-bones six-cylinder Chevrolet Biscayne to the Cadillac 75 limousine. And since the Catalina was still priced lower than the Jetstar and LeSabre, the lowest-priced full-sized Pontiac was often perceived by buyers as a better value in the marketplace due to its larger standard V8 engine and three-speed automatic transmission, and (in comparison to the Jetstar 88) bigger brakes.

===1965–1970===



The 1965 full-sized Pontiacs were completely restyled with more flowing sheetmetal featuring &quot;Coke-bottle&quot; profiles and fastback rooflines on two-door hardtops. Wheelbases increased to on all models.

Pontiacs for the 1965 were now available with GM&#x27;s new-for-1964 three-speed Turbo Hydramatic 400 transmission, often abbreviated as THM-400. This new unit replaced the older three-speed, four-range Roto-Hydramtic in the Catalina, as well as the four-speed Super-Hydramatic that was equipped in other Pontiacs. The THM-400 is torque converter based, similar in design to the Chrysler Torqueflite and Ford Cruise-O-Matic transmissions. Despite the Turbo Hydramatic 400 still bearing the &quot;Hydramatic&quot; name, it shared no design components with either of the older fluid-coupling based Roto or Super-Hydramatics. This new transmission was a large, but welcome, departure from the older transmissions, which were not as durable, smooth or fast as the new unit. The THM-400 also changed the shift pattern from the &quot;P-N-D-S-L-R&quot; to the safer and ultimately more modern &quot;P-R-N-D-S-L.&quot; Although this transmission was new for 1964, it did lack some of the functionality of the older transmissions, like the low first gear ratios (3.50:1 or 3.97:1 for the Roto and Super Hydramatics respectively) or the split torque design where only 40% of the power went through the inefficient fluid couplings, which helped improve economy.

The 389 and 421 cubic-inch V8s received a number of revisions including thinner wall block castings. The standard engine for Catalina models is the 389 two-barrel rated at with base three-speed manual transmission and 8.6 to 1 compression or with Turbo Hydramatic transmission and higher 10.5 to 1 compression. An economy regular-fuel version of the 389 two-barrel with 8.6 to 1 compression ratio that burned regular gas was available as a no-cost option with Turbo Hydramatic. Optional engines include a four-barrel 389 rated at with Turbo Hydramatic or 333 with stick shift, a Tri-Power 389 rated at , a four-barrel 421 rated at the same , 353 hp with Tri-Power or the 421 HO with Tri-Power and .

The 2+2 option changed from a trim package to an all-out performance car package for 1965 similar to Pontiac&#x27;s intermediate-sized GTO. The base engine with the 2+2 was now the 338-horsepower 421 four-barrel with the Tri-Power or 376-horsepower 421 HO with Tri-Power available as options.

The 1966 full-sized Pontiacs received a minor facelift of the &#x27;65 body with new grilles and taillight treatment. Inside, the instrument panel was revised along with interior trim. The 2+2 was upgraded from an option to full model status and engine-transmission offerings on all Catalina models remained the same as 1965 with the exception being the elimination of the 338-horsepower 389 Tri-Power option.

For 1967, Catalinas and other full-sized Pontiacs received a heavy facelift of the &#x27;65 bodyshell with more rounded wasp-waisted body contours and fuller fastback rooflines, along with concealed windshield wipers - an industry first. Replacing the 389 and 421 V8s of previous years were new 400 and 428 cubic-inch V8s with bigger valves and a valve angle change built off the same Pontiac V8 design in use since 1955. The valve angle change was so bigger valves and larger ports could be used. The standard Catalina engine was a two-barrel unit rated at with three-speed manual transmission or with Turbo Hydramatic. The engine was available as a no-cost option with the Turbo Hydramatic and differed from the standard unit by using regular gas as opposed to premium fuel. Optional engines included a four-barrel 400 rated at , a four-barrel 428 rated at or the four-barrel 428 HO rated at . The Tri-Power engine options were dropped for 1967 thanks to a new GM corporate policy headed primarily by Ed Cole which prohibited the use of multiple carbs on all vehicles except the Chevrolet Corvette and the Corvair, two of Cole&#x27;s babies when he was head of Chevrolet Engineering and later Chevrolet General Manager. Front disc brakes and a stereo eight-track tape player were new additions to the option list.

The 2+2 was offered for the last time in 1967 in both hardtop coupe and convertible. The 360-horsepower 428 was standard and the 428 HO was optional. This model was dropped due to low sales since its 1964 introduction as performance car buyers overwhelmingly preferred smaller and lighter intermediates such as Pontiac&#x27;s own GTO and the new Firebird ponycar, which was introduced for 1967. 

Safety came to the fore in 1967, and the Catalina featured all the new US Government-mandated safety equipment including an energy-absorbing steering column, safety steering wheel, dual-circuit hydraulic brake system, and soft interior parts.

For 1968, Catalinas and other full-sized Pontiacs received a minor facelifting of the &#x27;67 body with a new beak-nose split grille along with a reverting to horizontal headlights, and revised taillights. Engine offerings were similar to 1967 with revised horsepower ratings including 340 for the four-barrel 400, 375 for the 428 four-barrel and 390 for the 428 HO. Safety continued to be key in 1968 with new fender side-marker lights becoming standard. Cars built after January 1, 1968, included front outboard shoulder belts as standard equipment.

The 1969 Pontiacs received a major restyling with somewhat more squared off sheetmetal (though not as much as similar cars from other GM divisions) and rooflines, the coke bottle rear flanks were gone. However, the basic 1965 chassis, inner-body structure and four-door pillared sedan roofline were retained although vent windows were dropped on all models and Safari wagons got a new two-way tailgate that could be opened to the side like a door or downward like a tailgate – similar in design to that introduced by Ford Motor Company on Ford/Mercury wagons in 1966. Catalinas also got a one-inch wheelbase increase to 122. Headrests became standard on all &#x27;69 Pontiacs built after January 1. All 1969 GM cars (except the Corvair) got a new locking steering column that would become a Federal requirement starting with the 1970 models.

Variable-ratio power steering was a new option this year (pioneered by Cadillac in 1966) and front disc brakes were now automatically included when the power brake option was ordered.

Engine offerings consisted of a standard 290-horsepower 400 two-barrel (or no-cost optional regular-fuel 265-horsepower 400 with Turbo Hydramatic transmission), 330-horsepower 400 four-barrel, 370-horsepower 428 four-barrel or the 428 HO rated at 390 horses. The standard three-speed manual transmission and optional three-speed Turbo Hydramatic were continued as before, but the four-speed manual with Hurst shifter was dropped from the option list.

All full-sized Pontiacs, including Catalinas, received a new Grand Prix-like V-nose grille for 1970 along with &#x27;horns ports&#x27; on a facelifted front end and new taillights mounted in the rear bumper. Catalina sedans and coupes now came standard with a smaller 255-horsepower 350 cubic-inch Pontiac V8 as standard equipment with optional engines including the previously standard 400 two-barrel rated at 265 and 290 horsepower (still standard on convertibles and Safari wagons), a 330-horsepower 400 four-barrel and a two versions of the new 455 cubic-inch V8 rated at or 370 horses with the &quot;HO&quot; option. As in past years, a three-speed manual transmission with column shift was standard equipment, but most cars were equipped with the optional three-speed Turbo Hydramatic. Also offered for 1970, but seldom ordered, was a two-speed automatic transmission, Turbo Hydramatic 300 that was available with the 350 V8.

The 1965–70 GM B platform is the fourth best selling automobile platform in history after the Volkswagen Beetle, Ford Model T, and the Lada Riva.
===1971–1976===

For 1971, Catalina and other full-sized Pontiacs were completely redesigned and restyled from the wheels up with long hood/short deck proportions and fuselage styling somewhat similar to Chrysler Corporation&#x27;s 1969 full-sized cars, along with a double shell roof for improved roll-over protection and flush pull-up exterior door handles - the latter two features first seen on the Firebird. Catalina and Catalina Brougham sedans and coupes rode on a wheelbase while Bonneville and Grand Ville used a longer wheelbase, and Safari wagons were an inch longer at . Station wagons also got their own multi-leaf spring rear suspensions, while sedans and coupes continued to be suspended with front and rear coil springs. The graceful two-door hardtop roofline was shared with the Chevrolet Impala Sport Coupe, and hardtop coupes in full size Oldsmobiles and Buicks using the GM &quot;B&quot; body.

New for 1971 was the Catalina Brougham series, which offered a more luxurious interior trim than the regular Catalina, available as a two-door hardtop, four-door hardtop and four-door pillared sedan. It was similar in concept to the Ventura series (1960-1961, 1966–1969) and the Ventura Custom trim option on the Catalina (1962-1965, 1970). It was dropped in 1973 after its sales failed to meet expectations. 1972 was also the Catalina convertible&#x27;s final year.

The Catalina Safari wagon became simply the &quot;Pontiac Safari&quot; for 1971 (though it continued to share interior and exterior trimmings with Catalina sedans and coupes) while the more luxurious Executive and Bonneville wagons were replaced by the new Grand Safari wagon. While the Grand Safari shared its grille design with the new Grand Ville series, its interior trim was identical to the optional vinyl interior offered on the Bonneville series. Pontiac now grouped its full-sized wagons as a separate series from their sedan counterparts, as did Chevrolet (Brookwood, Townsman, Kingswood, Kingswood Estate), Oldsmobile (Custom Cruiser), and Buick (Estate Wagon).

As did all GM B-Body wagons, the Safari and Grand Safari received GM&#x27;s new clamshell tailgate. Operated by switches on the instrument panel or a key switch on the rear quarter panel, the tailgate slid into a recess under the cargo floor while the electric window slid upward into the rear roof section. Pontiac boasted the new system made it easier to load and unload the wagon in tight spaces, but the &quot;Glide-Away&quot; tailgate was prone to electrical and mechanical problems, and water and air leakage problems, as the cars aged.

Another trouble-prone feature Pontiacs shared with all GM B- and C-body cars for 1971 was a new power ventilation system. The system, also shared with the Vega, used the heater fan to draw air into the car from the cowl intake at the base of the windshield, and force it out through vents in the trunk lid or tailgate. In theory, passengers could enjoy fresh air even when the car was moving slowly or stopped, as in heavy traffic. In practice, however, it didn&#x27;t work.

Within weeks of the 1971 models&#x27; debut, however, Pontiac—and all other GM dealers—received multiple complaints from drivers who complained the ventilation system pulled cold air into the car before the heater could warm up—and could not be shut off. The ventilation system was extensively revised for 1972.

All models featured new Grand Prix-style wrap-around cockpit instrument panels that placed controls and instruments within easy reach of the driver along with two round pods for a speedometer and the other for warning lights, fuel gauge or optional gauges and electric clock. Interior trims were available in cloth and Morrokide vinyl or expanded Morrokide depending on model.

Standard engine in Catalina sedans and coupes was a 255-horsepower &quot;350&quot; (actually 355 cid) V8 with two-barrel carburetor. Catalina Brougham models and Safari wagons came standard with a 400 cubic-inch V8 with two-barrel carburetor rated at 265 gross horsepower that was optional on other Catalina models. Optional engines included a 455 cubic-inch V8 with two- or four-barrel carburetion and respective horsepower ratings of 285 and 325, respectively. All Pontiac engines for 1971 were designed to run on lower-octane regular leaded, low lead or unleaded gasoline thanks to a GM corporate edict, necessitating reductions in compression ratios.

Power front disc brakes were made standard equipment for the first time in 1971. As in previous years, variable ratio power steering and Turbo Hydramatic transmission were extra-cost options but became standard equipment midway through the 1971 model run. Also available on early 1971 Catalinas with the 350 engine was a two-speed automatic transmission in addition to the standard column-shift three-speed manual.
For 1972, Catalinas and other full-sized Pontiacs received new Grand Prix-style &quot;V&quot; nose grilles and sturdier front bumpers that could withstand crashes of up to , a year ahead of the Federal standard that took effect in 1973, along with revised taillight lenses.

The two-barrel 400 cubic-inch V8 was standard on all Catalina/Brougham/Safari models rated at 175 net horsepower compared to 265 gross horses in 1971 thanks to a switch in power measurements from gross ratings which were measured by a dynamometer with no accessories attached while the &quot;net&quot; figures were measured &quot;as installed&quot; in a vehicle with all accessories and emission gear hooked up. Optional engines included a two-barrel 455 rated at and a four-barrel 455 rated at . The year 1972 was the last for the Catalina convertible and the Catalina Brougham series.

Catalina and other 1973 full-sized Pontiacs featured fuller-width split grilles along with the now-federally mandated front bumper, and revised taillight lenses. Instrument panels continued the &quot;wrap-around&quot; theme but the two round gauges were housed in square pods. With the Catalina Brougham discontinued only the regular Catalina models and Safari wagons were offered this year. Catalinas and other full-sized Pontiacs including Bonnevilles and Grand Villes now rode on a common wheelbase for sedans and coupes though Safari and Grand Safari wagons continued on their own wheelbase.

Catalina sedans and coupes came standard with a 350 cubic-inch V8 rated at , with a 400 two-barrel optional and standard on Safari wagons. Optional engines included a 400 four-barrel and 455 four-barrel V8.
The 1974 Catalina and other big Pontiacs had a new Mercedes-like center split grille and revised rear styling with new bumpers on the aft end and license plate moved above the bumper. Two-door hardtop coupes featured new fixed triangular side windows, but kept the pillarless style with roll-down rear quarter windows, unlike Chevrolet, which eliminated the rolldown rear quarters in the Caprice and Impala Custom coupes. The four-door pillared and hardtop sedans were virtually unchanged from 1973. Interiors were much the same as 1973 except for a revised standard steering wheel and new cut-pile carpeting.

New to the option list were adjustable accelerator and brake pedals, a Pontiac exclusive (and seldom ordered), and a Radial Tuned Suspension that included the upgraded tires along with other suspension mods such as front and rear sway bars.

The 170-horsepower 400 V8 with two-barrel carburetor was now the standard engine on all models with a 225-horsepower 400 four-barrel and 250-horsepower 455 four-barrel V8 available as options. Also for 1974, the Safari wagon was renamed the &quot;Catalina Safari&quot; and continued to share interior and exterior trims with sedans and coupes.

Multiple economic factors affected sales, beginning with the 1973–1975 recession, the 1973 oil crisis and the introduction of smaller, more fuel efficient vehicles like the Pontiac Grand Am and imported vehicles like the Toyota Cressida, the Mercedes-Benz 280E and the BMW 530.
The year 1975 brought revised front and rear styling to Catalinas and other full-sized Pontiacs, along with standard radial tires and electronic ignition. The same assortment of 400 and 455 engines carried over from 1974 with reduced horsepower ratings ranging from 170 to 200, but now mated to catalytic converters, which provided improved driveability and fuel economy over previous emission control equipment, but mandated the use of unleaded gasoline. Four-door pillared and hardtop sedans featured new six-window styling with the sixth window on the hardtop sedan functioning as an opera window. 1975 also marked the end of Pontiac convertible production until 1982; the Grand Ville Brougham was the last full-size Pontiac convertible.

For 1976, only minor detail changes were made to Catalinas and other full-sized Pontiacs that included revised grilles (with rectangular headlights now on Catalinas with the &quot;Custom Trim Option-round headlights continued on base models) and taillight lenses. This year was the last for the 1971-vintage bodyshell, optional adjustable pedals, 455 V8 and the clamshell tailgate on Safari wagons. 1976 also marked the return of the Bonneville Brougham series to the top of the full-size line, as Pontiac marketers abandoned the Grand Ville name entirely.

===1977–1981===

In 1977, Pontiac and other GM divisions downsized their full-sized cars in an effort to lighten weight and improve gas mileage. The Catalina continued as Pontiac&#x27;s entry-level full-size automobile with a Buick-built 231 cubic-inch V6 now standard in sedans and coupes (Safari wagons came standard with V8 power) and optional V8s of 301 CID, 350 CID and 400 CID displacements, each Pontiac-built engines and offered in all states except California. The Pontiac 350 was offered in 1977, but replaced by Buick and Oldsmobile 350 V8s from 1978 to 1980; and the Pontiac 400, offered through 1978, was replaced by an Oldsmobile 403 V8 in 1979 only. An Oldsmobile-built 350 Diesel V8 was optional for 1980 and 1981, along with another cut-down Pontiac V8 of 265 CID.

With the downsized 1977 model, the Catalina Safari got a new two-way tailgate that could be opened to the side as a door or lowered as a tailgate which replaced the more complicated 1971-76 clamshell tailgate design. The wagons also shared the same full-coil spring suspension as their sedan counterparts, rather than the multi-leaf springs found on 1971-76 Safaris.

As Pontiac V8s were completely banned from the State of California beginning in 1977 due to the inability to meet the state&#x27;s more stringent emission control standards, Catalinas (and Bonnevilles) sold in California were equipped with engines from other GM divisions through 1981. Those included the Buick 231 V6 and an assortment of V8s including the Chevrolet 305, Oldsmobile 307, Buick and Oldsmobile 350s, and Oldsmobile 403 V8.

The Catalina was discontinued after the 1981 model year as Pontiac sought to abandon the full-sized car market as part of GM&#x27;s continued downsizing program. When production of the Catalina nameplate ended in 1981, over 3.8 million Catalinas had been sold since 1959.

==Canada and Canadian exports==

Strato Chief, Laurentian, Parisienne and Grande Parisienne
From the 1950s through 1970s, GM of Canada offered a unique hierarchy of full-size Pontiac series different from the American Catalina, Star Chief, Executive and Bonneville lines. In Canada, Pontiac was still marketed as a medium priced make, but with a lower price spread than those in the U.S. Closely paralleling Chevrolet&#x27;s Biscayne, Bel Air and Impala series, by 1959 the Canadian models were named Strato Chief, Laurentian and Pontiac Parisienne. The Strato-Chief series had been introduced for 1958, replacing the Pathfinder De Luxe. When Chevrolet introduced the &quot;Super Sport&quot; as a distinct model line in 1962, GM of Canada soon made available a similarly equipped Pontiac &quot;Custom Sport&quot; (rebadged Pontiac &quot;2+2&quot; in 1967 to mirror a name used by Pontiac in the US for a sporty model based on its Catalina series). And when Chevrolet rolled out its topline Caprice model in mid-1965 to compete with Ford&#x27;s newly introduced upscale Ford LTD, GM of Canada introduced the &quot;Grande Parisienne&quot; trim series for the 1966 model year. For the 4 years that Grande Parisienne was offered, 1966-1969 it was available as a 2-door hardtop, 4 door hardtop, or the model with no twin in the US, the 1967-1968 Grande Parisienne station wagon with hideaway headlights. Front end styling copied the U.S. market Grand Prix.

Like all Canadian Pontiacs built from 1955 to 1970, Laurentians used full-size Chevrolet chassis, drive trains, and other parts, but using a body shell similar in style to, but not interchangeable with, the U.S. Catalina. For example, a 1964 Pontiac Laurentian looks like a Catalina, but has more in common with the Chevrolet Bel Air. Through at least 1967, however, the Laurentian wore the three &quot;stars&quot; normally associated with the Pontiac Star Chief/Executive series, even though other exterior trim pieces were similar to the Catalina.

The Laurentian was available in all the body styles used for the Chevrolet Bel Air, including hardtop coupes and sedans, through the 1962 model run. After 1963, hardtops were offered only in the Parisienne and Grande Parisienne series (first offered in 1966), which paralleled the Chevrolet Impala and Caprice respectively. However, two-door hardtops returned to the Strato Chief and Laurentian series in 1969 because Pontiac discontinued its Catalina 2-door sedan in the U.S. after the 1968 model run.

The Canadian model line nameplates were never sold in the U.S. They were built for the Canadian market and for export from Canada as disassembled &quot;crate&quot; or &quot;kit&quot; cars. The one exception came when the Parisienne became an American Pontiac offering beginning in mid-1983 through 1986, although by this time the U.S. and Canadian offerings were identical. As the only remaining full-size Pontiac model available at the time, the Canadian Parisienne had been coveted by US dealerships as a flagship model to fill that market segment and compete with the Caprice offered by Chevrolet dealers. The existing name was deemed suitable for the purpose and production was simply extended to cover both countries.

Right-hand drive Laurentians were assembled from CKD kits by GM Holden in Australia from 1959 to 1963. In Australia, Laurentian was replaced by Parisienne for 1964. Parisiennes and Laurentians were assembled from CKD kits by GM South Africa in South Africa; and from SKD kits by GM New Zealand in New Zealand.

As well, these kits were assembled for both Left-hand drive and Right-hand drive markets in Europe at a GM plant in Antwerp, Belgium.

Canadian Pontiacs were used in part because, for fellow Commonwealth countries, there were advantages with import duties. But largely due first to the economies of part sourcing two separate GM lines from the same parts bin. Second, with higher gasoline prices and lower discretionary spending than in the US, Canadian Pontiacs like Chevrolets were more affordable, hence more marketable overseas. Thirdly, without the bulk and weight of American Pontiacs, their Canadian counterparts were better adapted where space can be limited, as in Europe and in a British RHD environment where an overly large full-size car suffers considerable disadvantages.

These RHD cars had the same dashboards whether Chevrolet or Pontiac (Impalas and Bel Airs were also exported to RHD markets) and only one dash design per bodyshell run so the 61-64 models had the one dash (a RHD version of the 1961 Pontiac layout) even though it changed annually in Canada and the 65-68s all had a &#x27;transposed&#x27; version of the &#x27;65 Chevrolet dash. The RHD cars also had antiquated, short, &#x27;clap-hands&#x27; wipers that almost met in the middle of the windshield rather than the parallel wipers of the LHD Canadian cars. Local radios, upholstery and two-speed heater/demisters were fitted – some Australian cars had local Frigidaire air conditioning.

<text>Sound-on-disc is a class of sound film processes using a phonograph or other disc to record or play back sound in sync with a motion picture. Early sound-on-disc systems used a mechanical interlock with the movie projector, while more recent systems use timecodes.

==Examples of sound-on-disc processes==
===France===
* The Chronophone (Léon Gaumont) &quot;Filmparlants&quot; and phonoscènes 1902–1910 (experimental), 1910–1917 (industrial)

===United States===

* Vitaphone introduced by Warner Bros. in 1926
* Photokinema, short-lived system, invented by Orlando Kellum in 1921 (used by D. W. Griffith for &quot;Dream Street&quot;)
* Digital Theater Systems

===United Kingdom===
* British Phototone, short-lived UK system using 12-inch discs, introduced in 1928-29 (&quot;Clue of the New Pin&quot;)

===Other===
* Systems with the film projector linked to a phonograph or cylinder phonograph, developed by Thomas Edison (Kinetophone, Kinetophonograph), Selig Polyscope, French companies such as Gaumont (Chronomégaphone, Chronophone), and Pathé, and British systems.

==Film censorship==
During the 1920s and early 1930s, films in the United States were subject to censorship by state and city censor boards, which often required cuts of scenes before a film would be licensed for exhibition. While films using the sound-on-film process could accommodate a patch for a requested cut with ease, a film using sound-on-disc would require an expensive retake. If the cost of compliance with a censor board was too high, the film would not be shown in that state or city.

<text>Speak, published in 1999, is a young adult novel by Laurie Halse Anderson that tells the story of high school freshman Melinda Sordino. After Melinda is raped at an end of summer party, she calls the police, who break up the party. Melinda is then ostracized by her peers because she will not say why she called the police. Unable to verbalize what happened, Melinda nearly stops speaking altogether, expressing her voice through the art she produces for Mr. Freeman&#x27;s class. This expression slowly helps Melinda acknowledge what happened, face her problems, and recreate her identity.

&quot;Speak &quot;is considered a problem novel, or trauma novel. Melinda&#x27;s story is written in a diary format, consisting of a nonlinear plot and jumpy narrative that mimics the trauma she experienced. Additionally, Anderson employs intertextual symbolism in the narrative, incorporating fairy tale imagery, such as Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;, and author Maya Angelou, to further represent Melinda&#x27;s trauma.

The novel was based on Anderson&#x27;s personal experience of having been raped as a teenager and the trauma she faced.

Since its publication, the novel has won several awards and has been translated into sixteen languages. However, the book has faced censorship for its mature content. In 2004, Jessica Sharzer directed the film adaptation, starring Kristen Stewart as Melinda.

&quot;Speak: The Graphic Novel,&quot; illustrated by Emily Carroll, was published by Farrar, Straus, and Giroux February 6, 2018. A 20th anniversary version of the novel featuring additional content was released in 2019 alongside the author&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Shout&quot;.

==Synopsis==
The summer before her freshman year of high school, Melinda Sordino meets senior Andy Evans at a high school party, who rapes her while she is drunk. Melinda immediately calls 9-1-1, but her shock renders her unable to speak and she flees to go home. The police arrive and break up the party, and several people are arrested. When word spreads that Melinda called the police, she becomes ostracized by her peers and abandoned by her friends.

Melinda is befriended by Heather, a girl from Ohio who is new to the community. However, once Heather realizes that Melinda is an outcast, she abandons her in favor of the &quot;Marthas,&quot; a group of girls who seem charitable and outgoing but are actually selfish and cruel. As Melinda&#x27;s depression worsens, she begins to skip school, withdrawing from her already distant (and somewhat neglectful) parents and other authority figures, who see her reclusiveness as a cry for attention. She slowly befriends her lab partner, David Petrakis, who encourages her to speak up for herself.

Melinda summons the courage to tell her former best friend Rachel, who has been dating Andy, about what happened at the party. While Rachel initially doesn&#x27;t believe Melinda, she realizes that this is the truth on prom night after Andy groped her. Enraged at Melinda for exposing him, Andy attacks Melinda in an abandoned janitor&#x27;s closet. Melinda fights back against Andy, attracting the attention of fellow students. When word spreads about Andy&#x27;s assaults against Melinda, the students no longer treat her as an outcast, but rather as a hero. Melinda finally regains her voice and tells her story to her art teacher.

==Narrative style==
&quot;Speak&quot; is written for young adults and middle/high school students. Labeled a problem novel, it centers on a character who gains the strength to overcome her trauma. The rape troubles Melinda as she struggles with wanting to repress the memory of the event, while simultaneously desiring to speak about it. Knox College English Professor Barbara Tanner-Smith calls &quot;Speak&quot; a trauma narrative, as the novel allows readers to identify with Melinda&#x27;s struggles. Hofstra University Writing Studies and Rhetoric Professor Lisa DeTora considers &quot;Speak&quot; a coming-of-age novel, citing Melinda&#x27;s &quot;quest to claim a voice and identity&quot;. &quot;Booklist&quot; calls &quot;Speak&quot; an empowerment novel. According to author Chris McGee, Melinda is more than a victim. Melinda gains power from being silent as much as speaking. McGee considers &quot;Speak&quot; a confessional narrative; adults in Melinda&#x27;s life constantly demand a &quot;confession&quot; from her.
Similarly, author and Florida State University Professor Don Latham sees &quot;Speak&quot; as a &quot;coming-out&quot; story. He claims that Melinda uses both a literal and metaphorical closet to conceal and to cope with having been raped.

==Theme==
One theme of &quot;Speak&quot; is finding one&#x27;s voice. Another theme in the novel is identity. The story can also be viewed as speaking out against violence and victimization. Melinda feels guilty, even though she was a victim of sexual assault. Yet, by seeing other victims, like Rachel, Melinda is able to speak. Some see &quot;Speak&quot; as a story of recovery. According to Latham, writing/narrating her story has a therapeutic effect on Melinda, allowing her to &quot;recreate&quot; herself.

===Post traumatic stress disorder===
One interpretation of Melinda&#x27;s behavior is that it is symptomatic of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of her rape. Like other trauma survivors, Melinda&#x27;s desire to both deny and proclaim what happened produces symptoms that both attract and deflect attention. Don Latham and Lisa DeTora both define Melinda&#x27;s PTSD within the context of Judith Herman&#x27;s three categories of classic PTSD symptoms: &quot;hyperarousal&quot;, &quot;intrusion&quot;, and &quot;constriction&quot;. Melinda displays hyperarousal in her wariness of potential danger. Melinda will not go over to David&#x27;s house after the basketball game, because she is afraid of what might happen. Intrusion is depicted in the rape&#x27;s disruption of Melinda&#x27;s consciousness. She tries to forget the event, but the memories keep resurfacing in her mind. Constriction is illustrated in Melinda&#x27;s silence and withdrawal from society. Latham views Melinda&#x27;s slow recovery as &quot;queer&quot; in its diversion from the normal treatment of trauma. Melinda&#x27;s recovery comes as a result of her own efforts, without professional help. Further, DeTora notes the connection between trauma and &quot;the unspeakable&quot;.

==Point of view==
&quot;Speak&quot; is a first-person, diary-like narrative. Written in the voice of Melinda Sordino, it features lists, subheadings, spaces between paragraphs and script-like dialogue. The fragmented style mimics Melinda&#x27;s trauma. The choppy sentences and blank spaces on the pages relate to Melinda&#x27;s fascination with Cubism. According to Chris McGee and DeTora, Anderson&#x27;s writing style allows the reader to see how Melinda struggles with &quot;producing the standard, cohesive narrative&quot; expected in a teen novel. Melinda&#x27;s distracted narrative reiterates the idea that &quot;no one really wants to hear what you have to say&quot;. In her article, &quot;Like Falling Up into a Storybook&quot;, Barbara Tannert-Smith says, By disrupting the present with flashbacks of the past, Anderson further illustrates the structure of trauma. Anderson organizes the plot around the four quarters of Melinda&#x27;s freshman year, starting the story in the middle of Melinda&#x27;s struggle. Anderson superimposed the fragmented trauma plot-line upon this linear high school narrative, making the narrative more believable.

==Symbolism and greater meaning==
Throughout &quot;Speak&quot;, Anderson represents Melinda&#x27;s trauma and recovery symbolically. Barbara Tannert-Smith refers to &quot;Speak&quot; as a &quot;postmodern revisionary fairy tale&quot; for its use of fairy tale imagery. She sees Merryweather High School as the &quot;ideal fairy tale domain&quot;, featuring easily categorized characters—a witchy mother, a shape-shifting best friend, a beastly rapist. Mirrors, traditional fairy tale tools, signify Melinda&#x27;s struggle with her shattered identity. After being raped, Melinda does not recognize herself in her reflection. Disgusted by what she sees, Melinda avoids mirrors. According to Don Latham, Melinda&#x27;s aversion to her reflection illustrates acknowledgement of her fragmented identity. In fact, the only mirror Melinda can &quot;see herself&quot; in, is the three-way mirror in the dressing room. Rather than giving the illusion of a unified self, the three-way mirror reflects Melinda&#x27;s shattered self. Likewise, Melinda is fascinated by Cubism, because it represents what is beyond the surface. Melinda uses art to express her voice. Her post-traumatic artwork illustrates her pain. The trees symbolize Melinda&#x27;s growth. The walls of Melinda&#x27;s closet are covered in her tree sketches, creating a metaphorical forest in which she hides from reliving her trauma. According to Don Latham, the closets in the story symbolize Melinda&#x27;s queer coping strategies. Melinda uses the closet to conceal the truth.

Anderson incorporates precursor texts that parallel Melinda&#x27;s experience. In the story, Melinda&#x27;s English class studies Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;, which features similar fairy tale imagery. Hester Prynne, an outcast protagonist like Melinda, lives in a cottage at the edge of the woods. Hester&#x27;s cottage parallels Melinda&#x27;s closet. For both women, the seclusion of the forest represents a space beyond social demands. The deciphering of Hawthorne&#x27;s symbolism mimics the process faced by readers of Melinda&#x27;s narrative. Similarly, Anderson connects Melinda&#x27;s trauma to that of Maya Angelou, author of &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot;. Melinda places a poster of Angelou in her closet. She admires Angelou because her novel was banned by the school board. Melinda and Angelou were both outcasts. Like Melinda, Angelou was silenced following her childhood rape.

==Honors and accolades==
&quot;Speak&quot; is a &quot;New York Times&quot; Best-Seller. The novel received several awards and honors, including the American Library Association&#x27;s 2000 Michael Printz Honor and the 2000 Golden Kite Award. It was also selected as a 2000 ALA Best Book for Young Adults. &quot;Speak&quot; gained critical acclaim for its portrayal of the trauma caused by rape. Barbara Tannert-Smith, author of &quot;Like Falling Up Into a Storybook: Trauma and Intertextual Repetition in Laurie Halse Anderson&#x27;s Speak.&quot;, claims the story&#x27;s ability to speak the reader&#x27;s language brought about its commercial success. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; says, &quot;Speak&#x27;s&quot; &quot;overall gritty realism and Melinda&#x27;s hard-won metamorphosis will leave readers touched and inspired&quot;. Ned Vizzini, for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, calls it &quot;different&quot;, &quot;a grittily realistic portrait of sexual violence in high school.&quot; Author Don Latham calls &quot;Speak&quot; &quot;painful, smart, and darkly comic&quot;.

===Censorship===
&quot;Speak&#x27;s&quot; difficult subject matter has led to censorship of the novel. &quot;Speak&quot; is ranked 60th on the ALA&#x27;s list of Top 100 Banned/Challenged Books for 2000–2009&lt;ref name=&quot;top 100 banned/challenged&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and 25th for 2010–2019. In 2020, the book was named the fourth most banned and challenged book in the United States &quot;because it was thought to contain a political viewpoint and it was claimed to be biased against male students, and for the novel&#x27;s inclusion of rape and profanity.&quot;

In September 2010, Wesley Scroggins, a professor at Missouri State University, wrote an article, &quot;Filthy books demeaning to Republic education&quot;, in which he claimed that &quot;Speak&quot;, along with &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; and &quot;Twenty Boy Summer&quot;, should be banned for &quot;exposing children to immorality&quot;. Scroggins claimed that &quot;Speak&quot; should be &quot;classified as soft pornography&quot; and, therefore, removed from high school English curriculum. In its 2010-2011 bibliography, &quot;Books Challenged or Banned&quot;, the &quot;Newsletter of Intellectual Freedom&quot; lists &quot;Speak&quot; as having been challenged in Missouri schools because of its &quot;soft-pornography&quot; and &quot;glorification of drinking, cursing, and premarital sex.&quot;

In the 2006 Platinum Edition of &quot;Speak&quot;, and on her blog, Laurie Halse Anderson spoke out against censorship. Anderson wrote: 

In her scholarly monograph, &quot;Laurie Halse Anderson: Speaking in Tongues&quot;, Wendy J. Glenn claims that &quot;Speak&quot; &quot;has generated more academic response than any other novel Anderson has written.&quot; Despite hesitancy to teach a novel with &quot;mature subject matter,&quot; English teachers are implementing &quot;Speak&quot; in the classroom as a study of literary analysis, as well as tool to teach students about sexual harassment. The novel gives students the opportunity to talk about several teen issues, including: school cliques, sex, and parental relationships. Of teaching &quot;Speak&quot; in the classroom Jackett says, &quot;We have the opportunity as English teachers to have an enormously positive impact on students&#x27; lives. Having the courage to discuss the issues found in &quot;Speak&quot; is one way to do just that.&quot; By sharing in Melinda&#x27;s struggles, students may find their own voices and learn to cope with trauma and hardships. According to Janet Alsup, teaching &quot;Speak&quot; in the classroom, can help students become more critically literate. Students may not feel comfortable talking about their own experiences, but they are willing to talk about what happens to Melinda. Elaine O&#x27;Quinn claims that books like &quot;Speak&quot; allow students to explore inner dialogue. &quot;Speak&quot; provides an outlet for students to think critically about their world.

<text>Alfred Boyd (September 20, 1835 – August 16, 1908) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada, who is usually considered to have been the first premier of Manitoba (1870–1871) though he was not recognized by that title at the time and was not the real leader of the government. He is more correctly referred to as the first Provincial Secretary of Manitoba. (Some modern sources list his official title as &quot;Chief Minister&quot;, but that does not appear in parliamentary documents from the period and is apparently a more recent invention.)

== Life ==
Boyd&#x27;s origins are obscure. Born in England, he may have arrived in Rupert&#x27;s Land as early as 1858. He established himself as a merchant and trader in Red River Colony and appears to have become wealthy by the time of the 1869 Red River Rebellion.

Boyd had little involvement in public life until January 1870, when he was elected for St. Andrew&#x27;s to the &quot;Convention of Forty&quot; (a parliament called by Louis Riel to decide the fate of the Red River Colony). Boyd refused to vote for Riel as the Convention&#x27;s leader and spoke in favour of territorial status (Riel favoured provincial status). Riel later referred to Boyd as an enemy.

With the end of the rebellion and the subsequent incorporation of Manitoba as a Canadian province (July 15, 1870), Lieutenant Governor Adams George Archibald (1870–1872) named Boyd as his Provincial Secretary. Archibald considered Boyd to be acceptable to the French population of the province, as well as to its English-speaking &quot;mixed-blood&quot; Anglo-Metis residents (i.e. persons of British and aboriginal descent). Boyd was elected for the riding of St. Andrew&#x27;s North in Manitoba&#x27;s first provincial election (December 27, 1870), defeating fellow government-supporter Donald Gunn by 58 votes to 28.

Archibald chose his first full cabinet in January 1871. Boyd, now the Minister of Public Works and Minister of Agriculture, served with Marc-Amable Girard, James McKay, Henry Hynes Clarke and Thomas Howard, a cabinet that reflected the province&#x27;s ethnic, religious and linguistic diversity. Archibald, the real Premier, frequently determined matters of policy without seeking advice from his ministers.

In office, Boyd faced many challenges from his constituents. was criticised for inaction by new Ontario immigrants who were settling in the province, as there was a need for bridges and jails (among other things). He was also criticized by his constituents for supporting public works construction in the French-Canadian community of St. Boniface and voting to incorporate the Roman Catholic Diocese of St. Boniface Faced with those pressures, Boyd resigned his position on December 9, 1871.

In resigning, Boyd called for &quot;English mixed-blood&quot; representation at the cabinet level. He was replaced by &quot;mixed-blood&quot; MLA John Norquay, as such.

Boyd was appointed to the Temporary North-West Council in 1872 and remained a member until the Council&#x27;s dissolution. He briefly rejoined the Manitoba executive as the province&#x27;s first Minister of Education (March–October 1873). After resigning a second time, he did not seek re-election in 1874.

Boyd is thought to have left in 1889 for England where he purchased several properties. By 1902, he resided in Pimlico and owned land in Essex. On his death in 1908, his estate was valued at 83,000 pounds.

<text>The Limehouse Declaration was a statement issued on 25 January 1981 by four senior British Labour politicians, all MPs or former MPs and Cabinet Ministers: Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams. It became known as the Limehouse Declaration as it was made near David Owen&#x27;s London home in Limehouse. The four were known as the Gang of Four.

The opening paragraph of the declaration indicates that it was triggered by decisions taken at the Labour Party conference in January 1981.
In this document, the so-called &#x27;Gang of Four&#x27; signalled their intent to leave the Labour Party and form a Council for Social Democracy, as they felt the party had been taken over by the left-wing members. This Council became the basis for the British Social Democratic Party (SDP).

The declaration was launched on a small bridge on Narrow Street, Limehouse. Organisation was last-minute, with Matthew Oakeshott being sent to the Savoy Hotel to make photocopies of the statement, and visiting the flat of Shirley Williams to find appropriate clothes for her to wear at the press call.

The four stated that they would soon produce an initial list of politicians and others who would support the new Council for Social Democracy. At this point the &#x27;Gang of Three&#x27; (Williams, Rodgers and Owen) had not yet left the Labour Party, but Williams admitted that &quot;almost inevitably&quot; they would take this step. However Williams, whom &quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot; considered to be the new group&#x27;s &quot;greatest asset as far as public appeal is concerned&quot;, was reported to want to delay the formal split until after the local elections in May in order to avoid upsetting Labour moderates whose support they hoped to win.

One week later, on 5 February 1981, an advertisement was published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; under the name of the Council for Social Democracy announcing that they had received 8,000 individual messages of support. The advertisement listed one hundred of their names, which included thirteen former Labour MPs, four of whom had been cabinet ministers including Lord George-Brown, former Deputy Leader of the Labour Party.

<doc id="540904" wikidata="Q5051853" url="?curid=540904" title="Category of preordered sets">
<text>In mathematics, the category Ord has preordered sets as objects and order-preserving functions as morphisms. This is a category because the composition of two order-preserving functions is order preserving and the identity map is order preserving. While Ord is a category with different properties, the category of preordered groups, denoted OrdGrp, presents a more complex picture, nonetheless both imply preordered connections.

The monomorphisms in Ord are the injective order-preserving functions.

The empty set (considered as a preordered set) is the initial object of Ord, and the terminal objects are precisely the singleton preordered sets. There are thus no zero objects in Ord.

The categorical product in Ord is given by the product order on the cartesian product.

We have a forgetful functor Ord → [[category of sets|Set]] that assigns to each preordered set the underlying set, and to each order-preserving function the underlying function. This functor is faithful, and therefore Ord is a concrete category. This functor has a left adjoint (sending every set to that set equipped with the equality relation) and a right adjoint (sending every set to that set equipped with the total relation).

==2-category structure==
The set of morphisms (order-preserving functions) between two preorders actually has more structure than that of a set. It can be made into a preordered set itself by the pointwise relation:

: (&quot;f&quot; ≤ &quot;g&quot;) ⇔ (∀&quot;x&quot; &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) ≤ &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;))

This preordered set can in turn be considered as a category, which makes Ord a 2-category (the additional axioms of a 2-category trivially hold because any equation of parallel morphisms is true in a posetal category).

With this 2-category structure, a pseudofunctor F from a category &quot;C&quot; to Ord is given by the same data as a 2-functor, but has the relaxed properties:

: ∀&quot;x&quot; ∈ F(&quot;A&quot;), F(&quot;id&quot;&quot;A&quot;)(&quot;x&quot;) ≃ &quot;x&quot;,

: ∀&quot;x&quot; ∈ F(&quot;A&quot;), F(&quot;g&quot;∘&quot;f&quot;)(&quot;x&quot;) ≃ F(&quot;g&quot;)(F(&quot;f&quot;)(&quot;x&quot;)),

where &quot;x&quot; ≃ &quot;y&quot; means &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; and &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot;.

<doc id="540906" wikidata="Q1173157" url="?curid=540906" title="Dave Coulier">
<text>David Alan Coulier ( ; born September 21, 1959) is an American actor, stand-up comedian, impressionist, podcaster, and television host. He is best known for his role as Joey Gladstone on the ABC sitcom &quot;Full House&quot;, and also voiced Peter Venkman on &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;, as well as Animal and Bunsen on &quot;Muppet Babies&quot;. He also played in the 2007 Christmas movie &quot;The Family Holiday&quot;.

==Early life==
David Alan Coulier was born on September 21, 1959, to David L. Coulier and Arlen Coulier in Detroit, Michigan, and was raised Catholic in nearby St. Clair Shores. He has three siblings. His mother&#x27;s side of the family is from Bathurst, New Brunswick, Canada, and his paternal grandmother was a Jewish immigrant from Germany. 

Coulier got his start in stand-up comedy in high school by impersonating his principal and other staff over his high school&#x27;s public-address system. He graduated in 1977 from Notre Dame High School in Harper Woods, Michigan, where he was a member of the varsity ice hockey team, playing defense alongside future NHL player John Blum. Coulier also attended high school with Mark Cendrowski, who became friends with him in the third grade and they often made 8mm films together during high school. 

Coulier attended the University of Michigan but dropped out after his freshman year to pursue comedy full time.

==Career==

Coulier met future &quot;Full House&quot; co-star Bob Saget for the first time at a comedy club in Detroit. The two became good friends and Coulier briefly lived with Saget and his then-wife Sherri on their couch in the early 1980s as he struggled to get his career started.

Coulier moved to Los Angeles at age 19 and started performing at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles, where he performed alongside Jay Leno, David Letterman, Jerry Seinfeld, and Robin Williams.

Coulier was initially cast as a player for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for its 1986 season. Shortly before the season started, however, he was left off the show because the show&#x27;s management thought he was too similar to another cast member, Dana Carvey.

Coulier has done extensive voice work for shows including &quot;Scooby and Scrappy-Doo&quot;, &quot;The Real Ghostbusters,&quot; &quot;Slimer! and the Real Ghostbusters&quot; (taking over the character of Peter Venkman after Lorenzo Music&#x27;s departure from the role), &quot;Extreme Ghostbusters&quot;, &quot;Muppet Babies &quot;after Howie Mandel left (Baby Animal, Baby Bunsen, Bean Bunny, and Uncle Statler and Waldorf, and a preteen Janice for one episode), &quot;The Jetsons&quot;, &quot;Rude Dog and the Dweebs&quot;, and &quot;Detention&quot;. From 1984 to 1985, he was also the host of a comedy series on Nickelodeon known as &quot;Out of Control&quot;.

Coulier is best known for playing Joey Gladstone on the ABC sitcom &quot;Full House&quot;. He stayed on the show from 1987 until its cancellation in 1995. He was famous for doing voices and impersonations. In addition to &quot;Full House&quot;, Coulier appeared on &quot;George and Leo&quot; and &quot;Nick Freno: Licensed Teacher&quot;. He has also hosted &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest People&quot; (first with Arleen Sorkin and later with Tawny Kitaen) and &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot;. Additionally, he was also a voice actor in &quot;Yogi Bear and the Magical Flight of the Spruce Goose&quot; and has voiced Felix the Cat on a few occasions. He also put out a solo album called &quot;Cut It Out&quot;, a self-proclaimed tribute to &quot;tank tops and short shorts.&quot;

In addition to his voice work, Coulier has also taken a few acting parts, appearing in the Disney Channel Original Movie&#x27;s &quot;The Thirteenth Year&quot; and &quot;The Even Stevens Movie&quot; (where he had a cameo as a reality show host), as well as the Nickelodeon original film &quot;Shredderman Rules.&quot; He wrote and starred in an unaired pilot for FX called &quot;Whispers and Balls&quot;.

He also founded his own children&#x27;s entertainment company, F3 Entertainment, in 2000. In 2003, Coulier appeared on season three of &quot;The Surreal Life&quot;. In 2006, he appeared on the TV reality show &quot;Skating with Celebrities&quot; on FOX, where he was paired with Olympic medalist Nancy Kerrigan. They were eliminated in episode four.

He is a member of Duck&#x27;s Breath Mystery Theater touring comedy troupe (which he claims is clean comedy but &quot;not quite as creepy&quot; as &quot;Full House&quot;) as well as the host of the series &quot;Animal Kidding&quot;.

On June 2, 2008, Chikara, a professional wrestling promotion based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, announced that Coulier was elected by the Chikara Board of Directors as the new commissioner of the company, a position that he held for two years until the next election (which took place on May 25, 2010). Coulier is the successor to former Commissioner and fellow &quot;Full House&quot; cast member Bob Saget.

In 2009, Coulier provided the voice for Bob McKenzie on the Canadian animated series &quot;Bob &amp; Doug&quot;, based on the &quot;SCTV&quot; characters Bob and Doug McKenzie. Coulier became the first person other than Rick Moranis to portray the character, as Moranis (who serves as executive producer) was not interested in resuming the part. Coulier says he understands that longtime fans might be skeptical of his take on the role, but he could not help jumping at the chance to portray one of his favorite comic characters. &quot;It&#x27;s huge shoes to fill, stepping into Rick Moranis&#x27; shoes. It&#x27;s such an established, great character and I guess the only thing I have going for me is that it kind of sounds alike and that half of my family is from Canada.&quot; His mother&#x27;s family is from Bathurst, New Brunswick.

Coulier continued to make regular television appearances as the host of shows such as &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest People&quot; and &quot;America&#x27;s Most Talented Kid&quot;. He continues to tour the U.S. and Canada as a stand-up comedian.

Coulier reprised his role as Joey Gladstone for the &quot;Full House&quot; spin-off &quot;Fuller House&quot;. The show premiered on February 26, 2016 and ran for five seasons, ending on June 5, 2020. In 2023, Coulier began hosting &quot;Full House Rewind&quot;, an episode-by-episode rewatch podcast.

==Personal life==
In the early 1990s, Coulier was married for two years to Jayne Modean. They have a son, Luc, born in 1990. Having divorced, he dated Alanis Morissette for two years, but they broke up shortly before she recorded her album &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;. He was rumored to be the subject of Morissette&#x27;s song &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; and, in a 2008 interview with the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot;, Coulier indicated he thinks the rumor is true, as there are many things about him in the song. However, in the 2021 documentary &quot;Jagged&quot;, Morissette denied the song is about Coulier, despite the coincidental timing. In 2005, Coulier began dating photographer and producer Melissa Bring. They married on July 2, 2014, in Montana.

Coulier is a private pilot who owns and flies a B35 Bonanza. His first general aviation flight was at the age of five in Michigan. He earned his private pilot certificate at the same airport in 1979 and is now instrument rated. In 2012, he did more flight training in a Cirrus SR20 to &quot;keep current.&quot; He is part of the Hat in the Ring Society to support the AOPA foundation, an organization that promotes safe flying.

Coulier is an ice hockey fan and participates in charity events with the Detroit Red Wings. He is also a fan of the Detroit Tigers and has played in celebrity softball games alongside fellow Tigers fan Tom Selleck.

In October 2024, Coulier was diagnosed with stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and began chemotherapy. In November 2024, Coulier announced he was going to be a grandfather, as his son, Luc and his wife are expecting their first child in March 2025.

==In popular culture==
===&quot;The Same Picture...&quot; blog===
&quot;The Same Picture of Dave Coulier Every Day&quot; is an image blog which publishes the same photograph of Coulier every day. Begun in 2011 by comedian Aaron Littleton, it is the progenitor of a trend of similarly themed blogs which feature the same content in every daily update. The trend of such &quot;content homogeneity&quot; has been studied in academic literature. The trend has also been called &quot;single-topic&quot;, and Forbes has called The Same Picture of Dave Coulier Every Day the apotheosis of the movement.

==== Reception ====
Media coverage has attributed the blog&#x27;s unchanging nature as reason for its popularity. BBC Trending featured the blog and said &quot;It could be that in the constant chaos of social media, perhaps what sometimes people really need is just the same thing over and over again.&quot; The AV Club commented on the blog saying: &quot;A port in a storm, The Same Picture Of Dave Coulier Every Day tumblr is perhaps the only consistent thing left in this tumultuous world.&quot; The Toronto Standard said, &quot;In a world pervaded with financial uncertainty and intractable conflict, a little consistency is surely warranted, and an anonymous philanthropist has given us just that in blog form.&quot;

Other outlets have noted the inherent humor of the blog. In reference to blog, the Mary Sue commented, &quot;Either Tumblr must be crowned King of the Comedy-Based Internet, or it must be stopped. It is difficult to tell which is the better option.&quot; The book Geek Lust says, &quot;how long can this madness continue?&quot;

<text>Stuart Sinclair Garson (December 1, 1898 – May 5, 1977) was a Canadian politician and lawyer. He served as the 12th premier of Manitoba from 1943 to 1948, and later became a Federal cabinet minister.

==Life and career==
Born in St. Catharines, Ontario, the son of William Garson and Margaret Annable, Garson came to Manitoba with his parents in 1901. He received a Bachelor of Law degree from the University of Manitoba in 1918 and was called to the bar a year later. He practised law in Ashern, Manitoba, from 1919 to 1928. Garson was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for the riding of Fairford in 1927 as a Progressive, defeating incumbent Liberal Albert Kirvan. He defeated again Kirvan in 1932, and faced only minor competition for the remainder of his time in the Manitoba legislature. In early 1932, Garson was one of the founding members of the province&#x27;s Liberal-Progressive coalition.

Garson was sworn in as provincial Treasurer on September 21, 1936. He also became minister of the Manitoba Power Commission on November 4, 1940, and Minister of Public Utilities on May 15, 1941. He continued to hold all of these positions after succeeding John Bracken as Premier on January 14, 1943. He resigned the MPC and Utilities portfolios in 1944.

Garson&#x27;s government was perhaps slightly more interventionist than those of Bracken and his eventual successor Douglas Campbell. Garson&#x27;s ministry began a program of rapid rural electrification, and made some effort to service the needs of returning soldiers after World War II. All the same, he rejected demands from the Manitoba Co-operative Commonwealth Federation to introduce programs in public housing and old-age pensions.

Under Garson&#x27;s leadership, the &quot;Liberal-Progressive&quot; alliance became a united party—albeit one that was dominated by former Progressive politicians. His ministry also retained close ties to the federal Liberal government of William Lyon Mackenzie King.

Garson moved to federal politics in 1948, at the behest of new Liberal Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent. On November 15, 1948, Garson was sworn in as Minister of Justice and Attorney General; he was elected to the federal parliament in a by-election for the rural seat of Marquette the next month. For the next nine years, Garson would be the dominant cabinet minister from Manitoba in St. Laurent&#x27;s government. He also served as Solicitor General of Canada from August 7, 1950, to October 14, 1952.

Garson lost his seat in 1957, the year that Progressive Conservative leader John Diefenbaker formed a minority government. Indeed, Diefenbaker&#x27;s Tories won victory mainly by ousting many Liberal MPs from the Prairies, including Garson. He retired from political life. In 1971, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada.

<text>Alessia di Matteo (July 4, 2003 – January 12, 2005) was an Italian from Genoa. Di Matteo became the first person in history to survive the transplantion of eight organs in a single operation, although she died a year later of complications. She was operated on at the age of six months on January 31, 2004, in Miami. She was born with megacystis microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis (MMIH) syndrome (also known as Berdon syndrome), a congenital smooth muscle disorder which affected her kidneys, intestines and stomach; she would have died earlier without treatment. She received a liver, a small and large intestine, a pancreas, a new stomach, a spleen and two kidneys. The operation was led by doctor Andreas Tzakis.

Di Matteo remained in Florida until one month before her death, so that doctors could watch for complications. Complications did develop, and eventually caused her death in a Genoan hospital at the age of 18 months.

<text>Bruce Bernard Smith (born June 18, 1963) is an American former professional football defensive end who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 19 seasons, primarily with the Buffalo Bills. He played college football for the Virginia Tech Hokies, where he was a twice All-American, and was selected with the first overall pick by the Bills in the 1985 NFL draft.

Considered one of the greatest defensive ends of all time, Smith is the NFL&#x27;s all-time career leader in quarterback sacks with 200. Smith also received 11 Pro Bowl selections and eight first-team All-Pro honors, while appearing in four consecutive Super Bowls with the Bills. He was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2006 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2009.

==Early life==
Smith is a native of Norfolk, Virginia, where he graduated from Booker T. Washington High School. In addition to being an All-American football player in high school, he played basketball, baseball, and wrestled. Smith accepted an athletic scholarship to play football at Virginia Tech.

==College career==
Known as &quot;the Sack Man&quot; as a Hokie, Smith finished his college career in 1984 as the most honored player in Hokie history. Foreshadowing his future success in pursuing quarterbacks in the NFL, he had a career total of 71 tackles behind the line of scrimmage, for losses totaling 504 yards. Smith had 46 career sacks, including an NCAA-leading 22 during a junior season in 1983 that saw him named First-team All-America by the AFCA (Coaches) and Newspaper Enterprise Association. In 1984, Smith capped off his tenure in Blacksburg with the Outland Trophy, given to the nation&#x27;s top lineman, and a consensus selection to the All-America Team. His accomplishments at Virginia Tech earned him a spot in the Virginia Tech Sports Hall of Fame.

==Professional football career==

===Buffalo Bills===
Following this stellar collegiate career, Smith was drafted by both the Buffalo Bills with the first pick of the 1985 NFL draft and by the United States Football League Baltimore Stars in the 1985 USFL Territorial Draft, and he decided to sign with the Bills. In his rookie year, he had just 6.5 sacks while starting thirteen games. After a rookie season in which his poor training habits limited his effectiveness, inspiration from teammate Darryl Talley and finding love with a college counselor whom he eventually married inspired him to improve his game. He quickly became known as a sack specialist, with fifteen in 1986. He had his first Pro Bowl and All-Pro selection the following year while having twelve sacks in twelve games. He recorded a touchdown that season in the December 13 game against the Indianapolis Colts on a fumble recovery in the end zone. It was his first and only touchdown in his career. He continued his run in 1988 with eleven sacks in twelve games. This was the first season for Smith in the playoffs and he would make the most of it with three sacks in two postseason games, although the Bills lost in the AFC title game to the Cincinnati Bengals.

In March 1989, as a restricted free agent, Smith signed an offer-sheet with the Denver Broncos for $7.5 million over five years. Smith had excelled as their defensive leader, but the Bills were concerned about him with his substance abuse problem (since he had been suspended four games the previous year for it) and thus had him followed by undercover detectives in November, which stuck with him months later. Faced with the choice between Smith and two draft choices from Denver, the Bills picked Smith. Now, as the highest-paid defensive player in the league, Smith would stay with the Bills for a considerable amount of time. He responded by playing in all sixteen games of the season and recording thirteen sacks to make his third straight Pro Bowl. He broke the record for sacks by a Bill all-time during the year (51), and he would continue to raise the total for years to come. Some conjecture that his 171 sacks in Buffalo set a standard that &quot;may be unreachable&quot; for future Bills. He recorded half a sack in the divisional round playoff game that year, which the Bills lost to the Cleveland Browns 34–30.
The next year, his defensive performance helped bring the Bills to Super Bowl XXV when he set a personal high in sacks with nineteen (three short of the then record for sacks in a season). He did not have a sack in either of the first two playoff games for the Bills, but Smith saved his efforts for Super Bowl XXV against the New York Giants. He sacked Jeff Hostetler in the end zone in the second quarter, becoming only the fifth player to record a Super Bowl safety (which gave the Bills a 12–3 lead in the second quarter). Later, Smith forced New York to turn the ball over on downs by tackling running back Ottis Anderson for a two-yard loss on a fourth-down conversion attempt. Only a failed last-second field goal attempt that narrowly went wide right kept the team from its first NFL championship.

In 1991, though Smith&#x27;s knee problems forced him out for most of the season, the Bills once again reached the Super Bowl. In 1992, in much better health, Smith was again a first-team All-Pro and was voted to the Pro Bowl while recording a team-leading fourteen sacks, and he repeated his sack total the following year. He led the league in forced fumbles twice with five (1994, 1996).

By 1996, though the Bills&#x27; run of Super Bowl appearances had ended, Smith was still putting up prolific numbers, with ninety tackles and fourteen sacks. In 1997, Smith had 65 tackles and fourteen sacks and by 1998, although he was getting older, he still had a respectable fifty tackles and ten sacks.

In the final postseason game of his career, he recorded a best in sacks with 2.5 in the wild card round game for the Bills against the Tennessee Titans, although they lost 22–16 on a last-second controversial play. 
Smith, along with Andre Reed and Thurman Thomas, was dumped from the Bills roster in an emergency salary cap measure after the 1999 season.

===Washington Redskins===
Smith signed with the Washington Redskins as a free agent. Although he was now playing in mostly passing situations, he posted 58 tackles and ten sacks in his first season. He pressed onward in pursuit of Reggie White&#x27;s all-time sacks record (198, achieved in 15 seasons), which he passed in Week 14 of the 2003 NFL season by sacking New York Giants quarterback Jesse Palmer in a 20–7 win at Giants Stadium. Smith finished his career with 200 career sacks, the only person ever to reach that mark, on a sack of Chicago Bears quarterback Rex Grossman.

Smith had hinted in interviews that 2003 would be his final season, but never completely ruled out continuing to play. However, on February 24, 2004, the Redskins released Smith, saving $6.5 million in salary cap space.

===NFL career accomplishments===
Smith was a first-ballot inductee to the NFL Hall of Fame. In his 19 NFL seasons, Smith played in 279 games, amassing a record 200 sacks, two interceptions, 46 forced fumbles, and 15 fumble recoveries, one of which he returned for a 33-yard touchdown. Of his 19 seasons in the NFL, 13 of them were seasons where he had at least ten sacks, a testament to his consistency year in and year out. He was also named to an All-Pro team ten times. As Smith spent most of his career in a 3–4 defensive scheme, a defensive scheme not geared toward creating sack opportunities for defensive ends, many consider the record particularly impressive. Indeed, Smith&#x27;s peers elected him to the Pro Bowl every season from 1987 to 1998 (with the exception of his injury-shortened 5-game 1991 season). In 1987, he was named the Pro Bowl MVP. Smith was twice named the AP&#x27;s NFL Defensive Player of the Year (1990, 1996), twice the NEA&#x27;s (1990, 1993) and four times the UPI&#x27;s AFC Defensive Player of the Year (1987, 1988, 1990, 1996).

==Honors==

==NFL career statistics==


==Post-football life==
Smith lives in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Having returned to his home state, Smith works as a large-scale hotel designer, undertaking many projects with Armada Hoffler. Most recently, he returned to Blacksburg, the site of his collegiate successes, where he purchased the Red Lion Inn. He built a Hilton Garden Inn Hotel with 137 sleeping rooms and is working on redeveloping the site (Smith&#x27;s Landing, hotel and restaurant complex). A Baptist, he is a member of Queen Street Baptist Church in Norfolk. Smith and his wife Carmen (who he married in 1990) have a son, Alston (born 1994).

Smith also works with Thurman Thomas in their new business venture, Legends Energy Group. They promote energy programs across North America.

Smith, Andre Reed, Thurman Thomas, and Jim Kelly were the subject of the 30 for 30 film &quot;Four Falls of Buffalo&quot; in 2015.

<text>The Pontiac Bonneville is a model line of full-size or mid-size FR (until 1987) or FF cars manufactured and marketed by Pontiac from 1957 until 2005, with a hiatus for model years 1982-1986. 

The Bonneville (marketed as the Parisienne in Canada until 1981), and its platform partner, the Grand Ville, are some of the largest Pontiacs ever built; in station wagon body styles they reached just over long, and at and more were also some of the heaviest cars produced at the time.

The Bonneville nameplate was introduced as a limited production performance convertible during the 1957 model year, its name taken from the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah — an early site of US auto racing and numerous world&#x27;s land speed record records, itself named after U.S. Army officer Benjamin Bonneville.

== Origin ==
The Bonneville name first appeared in 1954 on a pair of bubble-topped GM Motorama concept cars called the Bonneville Special, sharing an appearance with the Chevrolet Corvette. It was also the beginning of a new tradition of Pontiac vehicles using French words for model names.

It entered the production lineup as a high-performance, fuel-injected luxury convertible version of the Star Chief in 1957, and was loaded with every available option as standard equipment to include leather upholstery, power adjustable front seat, power windows, power steering, power brakes and power convertible top with the exception of air conditioning and a fashionable for the time continental kit.

Standard only for the Bonneville was Pontiac&#x27;s first-ever fuel injection system. A mechanical system built by Rochester, it was similar in principle, but not identical, to the contemporary Chevrolet Bel Air installed with the Rochester Ramjet continuous mechanical fuel injection (closed-loop). Pontiac did not release official power ratings for this engine, which had only been introduced earlier in 1955 replacing the flathead straight eight, saying only that it had more than . Contemporary road tests suggest that it was actually somewhat inferior to the Tri-Power engines, although it did have better fuel economy.

This put the Bonneville in a Cadillac-like price range of US$5,782 ($ in dollars ) - more than double the base price of the Chieftain on which it was built, with the result being a fully equipped Bonneville could cost more than the longer, entry-level Cadillac Series 62. Only 630 units were produced that first year, all of them fuel-injected, making it one of the most collectible Pontiacs of all time and was introduced to compete with the Chrysler 300C. The following year it became a separate model, and it would endure until 2005 as the division&#x27;s top-of-the-line model. 
== First generation (1958) ==
The Bonneville became a separate model in 1958, available as a two-door hardtop or a convertible. It paced the Indianapolis 500 in its first year. As a separate model, Bonneville had a significantly lower price tag of $3,586 ($ in dollars ) for the convertible, thanks to the removal of most of the luxury items found on the 1957 Star Chief bodystyle from standard equipment to the option list. Also a V8, marketed as a &quot;370&quot;, with four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts was now standard equipment.

The fuel-injection system continued to be offered with the standard engine on the 1957 Star Chief bodystyle was now listed as an extra cost option but very few 1958 Bonnevilles were so equipped due to a towering option price tag of US$500 ($ in dollars ), which was not considered a very good value considering that for US$93.50, a more reliable Tri-Power option was available with three Rochester two-barrel carburetors and similar power. The Tri-Power produces a claimed , while the fuel injected version was rated at at 4800 rpm and at 3,000 rpm on 10.5:1 compression.

The retail price dropped from the previous year to US$3,481 ($ in dollars ) for the coupe, adding leather interior and a power operated convertible top. The fuel-injected engine became an option on any Pontiac model. Only about 400 were produced before the fuel injection system was quietly dropped and fuel injection would not be offered on the Bonneville until 1987 with the Eighth Generation.

For 1958, GM was promoting their fiftieth year of production, and introduced Anniversary models for each brand; Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Chevrolet. The 1958 models shared a common appearance on the top models for each brand; Cadillac Eldorado Seville, Buick Limited Riviera, Oldsmobile Starfire 98, Pontiac Bonneville Catalina, and the all-new Chevrolet Bel-Air Impala. 1958 was also the year the &quot;Silver Streak&quot; styling feature was no longer offered, which was first used in 1933. It was also the last year of Harley Earls tenure as department head of GM&#x27;s &quot;Art and Colour Section&quot;.

== Second generation (1959–1960) ==

In its third year, the 1959 Bonneville became the senior series with the addition of the four-door hardtop sedan and Safari station wagon body styles, while the Pontiac Catalina became the junior series. The Bonneville played an important part that year in the introduction of two of Pontiac&#x27;s greatest marketing inspirations — the split grille and the &quot;Wide Track&quot; slogan, introducing a front tread width of and rear tread width of as opposed to other GM products with a width for front and rear width. At the bottom of the rear quarters, a &quot;skeg&quot;—a downward fin—jutted outboard to counterbalance the rearward point of the quarter panel.

The Wide Track slogan was not just ad copy, either, as Pontiac pushed its wheels further out toward the fenders than anyone else and created what were considered to be the best-cornering full-size cars in the industry. Both the grille design and the Wide Track phrase remained part of Pontiac&#x27;s image up to the brand&#x27;s termination. A &quot;Safe-T-Track&quot; differential, used to minimize wheel spin, was an option beginning in 1959. As the platform expanded to add sedans and the Safari station wagons, they were also used as a basis for various specialty cars such as hearses.


== Third generation (1961–1964) ==


The Bonneville was Pontiac&#x27;s senior model throughout the 1960s and was instrumental in pushing Pontiac to third place in sales from 1962 to 1970.

The distinctive protruding grille made its appearance on all Pontiac products during the early 1960s, and was a modern revival of a similar appearance on Pontiac products during the 1930s and early 1940s, as demonstrated on the Pontiac Torpedo.

The Bonneville differed from its lesser Catalina and Star Chief counterparts by featuring more luxurious interior trim with upgraded cloth and &quot;Morrokide&quot; vinyl or expanded &quot;Morrokide&quot; upholstery in sedans and coupes, expanded &quot;Morrokide&quot; in Safari wagons and genuine leather seating in convertibles. Bonnevilles (with the exception of Bonneville Safari station wagons) were also (along with Star Chiefs) built on a longer wheelbase version of GM&#x27;s B-Body. The 1962 hardtop coupe had a listed retail price of $3,349 ($ in dollars ).

In 1962, the Bonneville coupe was offered along with the all new Pontiac Grand Prix which has the same luxurious interior of the Bonneville on the shorter Catalina wheelbase, and the Grand Prix was slightly more expensive and exclusive.

For a luxurious appearance, the Bonneville came with instrument panels and door panels with walnut veneer trim, carpeted lower door panels, grab bar on the passenger side of the dash and courtesy lights and a rear arm rest. Beginning in 1964, a Bonneville Brougham option package was available that included an even more luxurious interior trim level with front and rear seats featuring center armrests, upgraded door panels and a standard Cordova (vinyl) roof with &quot;Brougham&quot; nameplates. The two-door hardtop was marketed as the &quot;Sports Coupe&quot;, the four door pillarless models were called &quot;Vistas&quot;.

Bonneville models were standard equipped with Hydra-Matic (through 1964) or Turbo Hydra-Matic (1965-on) automatic transmissions. Options included power steering and power brakes as well as air conditioning. Other popular options included power windows, power seats, radio, cruise control, and 8-lug aluminum wheels that included integral brake drums for improved stopping power.

The Bonneville also had more powerful standard V8 engines than other full-sized Pontiacs, including the or V8s with four-barrel carburetors (power ratings of depending on year) with many optional V8 offerings, such as the availability of the Tri-Power (three two-barrel carburetor) options on both the and V8s that offered up to through 1966.

For 1963 only, Pontiac offered the Super Duty with two four-barrel carburetors, rated at , as a US$2,250 option ($ in dollars ) whereas the base Bonneville was listed at US$3,349 ($ in dollars ).

== Fourth generation (1965–1970) ==



In 1965, B-Body Pontiacs received a dramatic restyle, featuring fastback rooflines on coupes, rakish fender lines, and even more pronounced &quot;Coke bottle styling&quot;. Bonnevilles followed largely the same styling cues as on other 1965 Pontiacs, but was 8 inches longer thanks to its new 124-inch wheelbase chassis. The interior featured new instrumentation and dashboard styling as well as new upholstery. This series Bonneville retained the longer wheelbase over the Grand Prix but the hardtop coupe was priced lower at $3,288 ($ in dollars ) and was not offered the center console included in the Grand Prix. This generation also introduced fender skirts over the rear wheels for an upscale look, shared with Cadillac, Buick and Oldsmobile senior models.

Engine options remained unchanged from the 1964 model year, with a , 333 hp unit being standard, equipped with a Carter AFB 4-barrel carburetor. A engine was an optional upgrade. Both engines had choices of Tri-Power multi-carburetion setups and higher compression ratios.

New for Pontiacs in 1965 was GM&#x27;s Turbo-Hydramatic 400 transmission, which was released the year prior. This new 3-speed unit had a torque converter, unlike the old fluid-coupling based Super-Hydramatic featured on past Bonneville models. The new transmission also changed the shift pattern from &quot;P-N-D-S-L-R&quot; to a safer and ultimately more modern &quot;P-R-N-D-S-L.&quot;

In 1965, Pontiac Motor Division received the Motor Trend &quot;Car of the Year&quot; award. As part of this award, Motor Trend reviewed GTO, Grand Prix, Catalina 2+2 and Bonneville.

In 1966, the Bonneville featured a minor update, with new front and rear sheet metal, trim and bright work. The interior saw some updates, including a more squared-up dashboard and minor changes in instrumentation. Powertrain components were the same as 1965.

The Bonneville for 1967 received a major update over the previous years. Styling was changed dramatically and featured a new grille-in-bumper front design, more creases to accentuate the &quot;Coke bottle&quot; styling and an updated rear fascia. The interior featured a new wraparound-style dash with new switchgear, instrumentation and trim. As per the up-and-coming US Title 49 legislation, 67&#x27; Bonnevilles were equipped with seatbelts as standard, as well as other government mandated safety equipment.

1967 also saw a large powertrain and chassis refresh for Pontiac. The 389 cubic inch plant was replaced with one, and the 421 cubic inch plant was replaced with a one. As per GM&#x27;s internal edict, the multi-carburation setups found on earlier cars were replaced with the new Quadra Jet &quot;spread bore&quot; carburetor. Carter AFB carburetors were still standard, but the Quadra Jet was featured as the new &quot;High performance&quot; upgrade. A myriad of horsepower ratings were optional. A dual-circuit master cylinder was standard as per legislation and disc brakes became an optional extra.

1968 saw a large styling update for Bonneville. The front fascia was heavily revised with new side-by-side headlights, however, the side and rear styling stayed largely the same from 1967. The interior saw some minor updates to styling with less chrome, as well as an available 8-Track Tape player.

Power was upgraded to 340 horsepower on the base 400 CI engine, up from 333 on the 1967 model year, the 428 CI engine remained an option

In 1969, the rest of the Bonneville&#x27;s styling was updated. The front fascia stayed similar to 68&#x27;, however, the rest of the car saw a restyle. The creases on the side were removed and the overall &quot;Coke Bottle&quot; effect was lessened. The rear end saw widened taillights and a color coded bumper insert. The interior saw even more updates, featuring more padding, wood trim and a slanted dashboard.

Power trains were upgraded to a standard 360 hp 428 CI engine.

1970 saw the most dramatic update to styling for Bonneville, featuring an entirely new front fascia, with more square features and an updated vertical twin grille design. Wrap around amber turn signals were integrated into the lower bumper. Side body lines remained similar to the 69&#x27; model year, however the rear design was completely revised with lowered tail lights and bumper, with a design more similar to that of 65&#x27; and 66&#x27; model years than those directly prior.

The interior was similar to the 1969 model year, retaining the slanted design and minimal chrome trim.

A new V8 was made standard for the 1970 model year, with the 400 CI engine being an option.

== Fifth generation (1971–1976) ==
For 1971, the Bonneville was downgraded in the model hierarchy, as a new top line Grand Ville series was introduced. In effect, it took the place of the discontinued Executive above the lower-priced Catalina. The Bonneville had new &quot;Monocoque&quot; styling and was offered in three body styles, a pillared four-door sedan, four-door hardtop sedan and two-door hardtop coupe. The standard engine for 1971-72 was a 455 cubic-inch V8 with two-barrel carburetor that was rated at 280 gross horsepower for 1971 and 185 net horsepower for 1972 and optionally available was the four-barrel version of the 455 rated at 325 gross horsepower in 1971 and 250 net horsepower in 1972. The on-paper power ratings reflect the change in power measurement undertaken by the industry for 1972. 1971 was also the first year for Pontiac and other GM divisions to reduce compression ratios on all engines across the board to operate on lower-octane regular leaded, low-lead or unleaded gasoline, reflecting a corporate edict anticipating the introduction of catalytic converters in 1975 to help meet increasingly stringent federal (and California) emission requirements.

In mid-1971, a Turbo-Hydramatic transmission, power steering and power front-disc brakes became standard equipment on Bonneville and other full-sized Pontiacs (as well as other full-sized GM cars).

From 1973 to 1976, the Bonneville&#x27;s standard engine dropped to a 170-horsepower 400 cubic-inch V8. Optionally available was the 455 four-barrel V8 rated at in 1973 and 1974 and 200 in 1975 and 1976. In 1973, Bonneville was the only full-sized Pontiac to offer a &quot;Radial Tuned Suspension&quot; option package which included the steel-belted radial tires along with an upgraded suspension with Pliacell shock absorbers and front and rear sway bars. The RTS option was expanded for 1974 to all full-sized Pontiacs and radial-ply tires became standard on all 1975 models though an upgraded &quot;RTS&quot; package was still available as an option.

1975 saw the end of the pillarless two-door hardtop model, replaced by a coupe with frameless door glass but with a thick &quot;B&quot; pillar and fixed rear &quot;opera&quot; window. The 1975 model year introduced rectangular headlights - its frontal appearance was similar to the Cadillac DeVilles and Fleetwoods of the same era.

With the demise of the Grand Ville series after 1975, Bonneville once again became the top-line full-sized Pontiac series, with a Bonneville Brougham model featuring the luxurious interior appointments from the departed Grand Ville.

Adjustable pedals were optional in 1976, the last year the Bonneville was offered as a pillarless 4-door hardtop; all subsequent Bonnevilles would have a thick B-pillar and metal-framed door glass.

Size comparison between 1974 and 1984 full-size Pontiac sedans

== Sixth generation (1977–1981) ==
The Bonneville was significantly downsized for model year 1977. Bonnevilles (and Catalinas) were shorter in length, over four inches (102 mm) narrower and 800 pounds lighter compared to their 1976 counterparts, while offering increased headroom, rear seat legroom and trunk space, and much-improved fuel economy – a major selling point in the years following the 1973-74 energy crisis.

Only a pillared four-door sedan and two-door coupe (with optional opera windows) were offered, as the hardtop sedans and hardtop coupes offered in previous years were discontinued for all GM divisions. 

The Bonneville regained the &quot;Safari&quot; station wagon as part of its model lineup for the first time since 1970, with faux woodgrain exterior trim and interior appointments shared with Bonneville coupes and sedans. The Safari was available in both 6 and 9-passenger configurations and featured a dual action side- or bottom-hinged tailgate, rather than the disappearing clamshell tailgates of 1971-76 full-sized Pontiac wagons.

For 1977 and 1978, the standard engine in Bonneville was Pontiac&#x27;s new 301 cubic-inch V8 rated at , while optional engines included a 170-horsepower 350 or 180-horsepower 400 cubic-inch V8. A 185-horsepower Oldsmobile 403 cubic inch V8 was also an option. In later years, increasingly stringent fuel-economy standards mandated by the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulations would lead to the discontinuation of the larger engines, with a 231 cubic-inch Buick V6 becoming the standard engine on Bonneville coupes and sedans for 1980 and 1981, with the only optional V8s offered including 265 and 301 cubic-inch Pontiac-built gasoline engines or an Oldsmobile-built 350 cid diesel powerplant.

For 1980, all GM B-bodies received revised styling and aerodynamic improvements along with reduced weight.

The Bonneville and Catalina, already the smallest-selling of GM&#x27;s B-body line, suffered a serious drop in demand following the economic recession that began in the spring of 1979. With that, GM discontinued the 6th generation with the 1981 model year, along with the 265 and 301 engines.


== Seventh generation (1982–1986) ==
Following the discontinuation of full-sized Pontiacs, the Bonneville name was instead simply swapped onto the midsized LeMans, which also suffered from poor sales. Thus, GM planners reasoned that attaching a more well-known model name to it would spark demand. This model had been produced since 1978 along with its siblings the Chevrolet Malibu, Oldsmobile Cutlass, and Buick Century, and sported a Buick 231 cid V6, Chevrolet 305 cid V8, or Oldsmobile 350 cid diesel V8. (A Buick 4.1 liter V6 was available in 1982.) The 1982-1986 models were officially known as the Pontiac Bonneville Model G (built on the GM &quot;G&quot; platform), although later models were not badged as such. Styling was revised to bear a closer resemblance to the departed B-body Bonneville and coupes were dropped. GM also began marketing the Bonneville in Canada for the first time starting in 1984 (1982 and 1983 Canadian models carried the Grand LeMans name), as GM&#x27;s full-size Bonnevilles in Canada were referred to as Parisienne.

While the previous LeMans, on which the new Bonneville was based, was classified as an A-Body, introduction of GM&#x27;s new front wheel drive A-bodies (e.g. Pontiac 6000) in 1982 prompted the change to &quot;Model G&quot; on these RWD cars. 1983 was the last year for the G-body station wagon as the Pontiac 6000&#x27;s wagon replaced it. The Bonneville sedan continued in base, Limited Edition (LE), and Brougham versions through 1986. The 1982-1986 Bonnevilles are direct descendants of the 1964 Pontiac Tempest. These 1982-1986 Bonnevilles were the smallest and the last of the old breed of Bonnevilles, having rear wheel drive, full perimeter frame (body on frame), and old-fashioned American car ride and styling.

However, some Pontiac customers did not take to the &quot;downsized&quot; Bonneville as a portion of new-car buyers were switching their preferences from compact and mid-sized cars back to full-sized, V8-powered cars thanks to improving gasoline prices. Late in the 1983 model year, Pontiac reintroduced a full-sized car to the American market by bringing over the Canadian-built Pontiac Parisienne (which was essentially a restyled Chevrolet Caprice and powered by Chevrolet V6 or V8 engines). The Bonneville was then again one notch below the top of the line from late 1983 through 1986.

However, exactly as before, a downsizing proved its salvation. In 1987, the Parisienne was discontinued and the Bonneville was completely redesigned as a front-wheel drive car, rejoining its pre-1982 platform mates: the Buick LeSabre and Oldsmobile Delta 88 and it regained its status as the senior Pontiac.
== Eighth generation (1987–1991) ==

For 1987, Pontiac migrated the Bonneville from the rear-drive G-body with a V8 to the GM&#x27;s one year old front-drive H Body platform, shared with the Buick LeSabre and Oldsmobile 88. Initially, a 3.8 L V6 was the sole engine, mated to a four-speed Hydramatic 4T60 automatic — in base and LE trim levels. The base model was only used for 1987. For LE models, an SSE sport package was also available featuring a quicker gear ratio, sportier suspension and more standard features, marketed as having a more sporty, European character than the LeSabre and 88.

For model year (MY) 1988, Pontiac replaced the LG3 engine with a revised version of the same engine, with an increase of 10 hp and 10 ft⋅lbf (14 N⋅m) of torque — the 3.8 engine now used a regular production code (RPO) LN3 and was now called the &quot;3800 V6&quot;. Featuring sequential-port fuel injection, the engine produced and . Other models on the H-body platform were fitted with the LN3 engine one year later, in 1989. The LN3 was used through 1991, since the Bonneville was redesigned for the 1992 model year.

Also in 1988, the LE model, which was previously the top trim level for 1987, becomes the base trim. The base model, which was used for 1987, was dropped. Additionally, two new models are introduced: the midlevel SE, which went from an option package to a trim level, and the SSE trim. The SE and SSE trims were then available with many more comfort and convenience options standard such as: electronic climate control, a digital compass, Driver Information Center, 8-way (14-way for the SSE according to GM material) power leather seats, heated power mirrors, CD player with the premium sound package and many more.

The SSE features an extra deep rear valence, a spoiler, lower body cladding, a digital compass/trip computer, an eight speaker premium sound system and much more. One notable feature of the SSE was the addition of an automatic leveling rear air suspension, which also included an inflator in the trunk. The SSE trim was exclusively equipped with an exterior sport appearance package that included body cladding, assorted ground effects, a body color grille and removal of the Bonneville door badges and Pontiac trunk badge, and replacing the Bonneville trunk badge with an SSE Bonneville badge.

For 1989, a compact disc player and remote keyless entry became optional. For 1990 models, a facelift was introduced for the Bonneville, with revisions to the grille, headlights, and taillights, which included amber rear turn signal indicators. For the 1991 model year, Pontiac made suspension revisions. 1991 was also the last year for the first front-wheel-drive generation of the Bonneville.



== Ninth generation (1992–1999) ==
The ninth generation Bonneville debuted on February 8, 1991, at the 1991 Chicago International Auto Show, with sales launching in July 1991 for the 1992 model year. The exterior featured an aerodynamic drag coefficient of .305; the interior featured a trunk pass-through; and two available engines: the naturally-aspirated 3.8-liter V6 and its supercharged variants. Both engines used a 4-speed overdrive automatic transmission. The ninth generation Bonneville was the first General Motors vehicle available with dual front passenger airbags.

Developed over a 4½-year period from 1986 to early 1991 under program director Dave Mitchell, styling work took place from 1987 to 1988, with a final design by John Folden chosen in 1988 and frozen for production that same year. The first prototypes were built in 1989 and entered testing in mid-1989. In August 1990, production preparation began, with early production &quot;builds&quot; constructed during late 1990. The first series production models were assembled in May 1991, with SE variants launched in July 1991.

Entry trim was the SE, the only trim with available six-passenger seating; the SSE was the mid-level trim, and the SSEi was the new top-level trim, which received a standard passenger-side airbag. According to Pontiac, the trim acronyms had no implied meaning. The base and mid-level models offered GM&#x27;s naturally-aspirated 3.8-liter V6, and the SSEi received its supercharged variant. All engines used a 4-speed overdrive automatic transmission. SSEi models received dual airbags and antilock brakes. SE and SSE models received a driver-side airbag and optional ABS. The SSE models came with standard ABS and traction control.

The new N/A 3800 Series I (RPO: L27) engine was used, producing and , as well as the newly designed force inducted Series I 3800 (RPO: L67) equipped with an Eaton M62 roots type supercharger which made and . The newly revised N/A L27, for the 1992 model year only, was not equipped with an EGR Valve, and can be distinguished by its white intake manifold, as opposed to black from 1993 and on.
Abridged safety options list:


Model Year (MY) 1993: Beginning with MY 1993, the Bonneville SE could be optioned with a Sport Luxury Edition (SLE RPO: H4U) package, which included leather seats, electronic climate control, automatic headlights, premium sound, &quot;crosslace&quot; alloy wheels, a small console in the headliner, chrome delete side and bumper moldings, center shift console, and touring suspension. Certain equipment such as electronic climate control and premium sound could be deleted from an SLE equipped car. Through 1997, SE models equipped with the Supercharged engine option, required the SLE/H4U package. These carried SE emblems, and the SLE/H4U appeared on the Series Production Identification (SPID) label of equipped vehicles as a Regular Production order (RPO) code. For MY 1998, SLE emblems were added to the vehicle exterior. The SLE trim continued onto the &#x27;99 model year. Many more standard was included with the SSE trim. The SSEi came standard with most of the available options in the lower models, as well as the supercharged 3800 engine (RPO: L67).

MY 1994: For 1994, SSEi trims used a new Generation III Eaton M62 supercharger with integral OBD-1.5 capabilities, raising the horsepower to and torque to . MY 1994 introduced the new five-spoke &quot;Torque Star&quot; wheels; and exhaust resonator to lower the engine&#x27;s tone; and front passenger airbag. The former SSEi trim level became an SSEi Supercharger Package. Traction control became optional for the &#x27;94 SSE trims, which included GM&#x27;s Computer Command Ride suspension,s designed to reduce body lean and pitch and automatically adjust the suspension from soft to firm when cornering, accelerating, or stopping.

MY 1995: For 1995, SE and SSE trims received the naturally aspirated Series II 3800 engine (RPO: L36) making and . The SSEi was equipped with the Series I SC 3800 (RPO: L67) engine until the 1996 model year, when it too was updated.

===1996–1999===


MY 1996: In September 1995, styling changes were introduced for the 1996 model year facelift, with revised tail lights, headlights, grille, and lower body cladding. Trim levels largely shared common lower cladding approaches, with the SSEi again receiving a unique front bumper and grille. Also for 1996, the supercharged version of the 3800 Series II engine was introduced. The SSEi received a new Eaton M90-supercharged L67 engine, producing and optional on the SSE trim. The engine was used from 1995 until it was retired from the Bonneville in 2003.

SE trim variants could be ordered with the L67 engine, which in turn required the Luxury Edition (SLE)(RPO H4U) package, which included a small console in the headliner, cobra head shifter, performance/normal shift selection buttons, leather interior, chrome delete side and bumper moldings, center shift console, and touring suspension. for MY 1995–1997, SLE/H4U equipped Bonnevilles carried SE rather than SLE external badging.

MY 1997: For MY 1997, a heavy-duty version of the 4T65E-HD was introduced for the SSEi models. Also in 1997, to mark the 40th year of production of the Bonneville, Pontiac offered a 40th Anniversary Edition, in six trims: the SE, the 40th Anniversary SE, the SSE, the 40th Anniversary SSE, the SSEi, and the 40th Anniversary SSEi. The 40th anniversary models all had a VIN with Y40. With a total production of 637 units, the 40th Anniversary SSEi is the rarest model.

MY 1998: For 1998, the Bonneville gets no major changes. However, a new transmission, the 4T65-E was introduced for the naturally aspirated 3800 installed in SE and SSE models. For 1999, the Bonneville essentially stood pat since an all-new model would arrive in 2000.

In March 2008, GM announced that these engines and other GM engines supplied with Dexcool antifreeze coolant might be prone to intake manifold failure and other problems with the cooling system if proper regular maintenance is not correctly performed. After settlement of a class-action lawsuit, GM agreed to compensate owners of many vehicles that suffered damage, regardless of negligence on the part of the consumer, if the consumer could prove damages.

== Tenth generation (2000–2005) ==


The 2000 Bonneville was restyled, using GM&#x27;s G platform, with the widest overall track in its competitive class at up front and in the rear. GM&#x27;s StabiliTrak stability control system was introduced on the top-of-the-line supercharged SSEi model, later replaced by the GXP.

===Trim levels===
The Bonneville was marketed in three trim levels: SE, SLE and SSEi. The SE came with a 3.8L V6 engine, 4-speed automatic transmission, air conditioning, cruise control, front bucket seats (a 55/45 split front bench was available on the SE only), 6-way power driver seat with lumbar adjustment, AM/FM stereo with CD player and 225/60/R16 tires. The SLE added traction control, OnStar, leather-wrapped steering wheel, rear spoiler and 17-inch alloy wheels wrapped in 235/55/R17 tires. The SSEi adds a 3.8L supercharged V6 engine, front-side air bags, leather upholstery, 12-way power driver seat and Monsoon AM/FM stereo with cassette and CD player.

For the last year of production, Pontiac gave the mid-level SLE the new GXP styling. The 2005 SLE featured all GXP styling cues, except the wheels, badging, muffler tips and engine all remained unique to the GXP.

===Return of the V8===
For 2004, the Bonneville regained a V8 option on the GXP trim. This was the first time since 1986 that a Bonneville had a V8 engine. As a result of the discontinuation of the Oldsmobile Aurora, this opened up a &quot;hole&quot; in the GM lineup between Pontiac and Buick, allowing Pontiac to expand upmarket somewhat. The engine is Cadillac&#x27;s Northstar V8, producing , . As Pontiac&#x27;s website said, &quot;With GXP, V8 power gets reintroduced into the Bonneville line in the form of the world-renowned 4.6 L (279 in³) Northstar V8 engine, giving in 6.5 seconds demonstrates better performance than BMW 330i and 530i, and Lexus ES. Its 3.7:1 final drive ratio is the most aggressive found on any car in its class.&quot;

===Safety===
NHTSA crash tests for the 2005 Pontiac Bonneville resulted in a safety rating of 4-stars for the Driver and 5-stars for the Front Passenger.

=== Discontinuation ===
GM announced on February 8, 2005, that the Bonneville would be dropped from Pontiac&#x27;s lineup for 2006. The last Bonneville was assembled on May 27, 2005. About 12,000 Bonnevilles were sold in 2005. With more than half of Pontiac dealers also selling Buick models, the Buick Lucerne along with the Chevrolet Impala continued as GM&#x27;s only mainstream full-size cars until the introduction of the 2008 G8.

<doc id="540936" wikidata="Q1235693" url="?curid=540936" title="Mort Weisinger">
<text>Mortimer Weisinger (; April 25, 1915 – May 7, 1978) was an American magazine and comic book editor best known for editing DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Superman&quot; during the mid-1950s to 1960s, in the Silver Age of comic books. He also co-created such features as Aquaman, Green Arrow, Johnny Quick, and the original Vigilante, served as story editor for the &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; television series, and compiled the often-revised paperback &quot;1001 Valuable Things You Can Get Free&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life and SF fandom===
Weisinger was born in the Washington Heights section of New York City and was raised in the Bronx, as the son of Austrian Jewish parents. His father was a businessman in the garment trade. At 13, he was introduced to science fiction by means of a borrowed copy of the August 1928 issue of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; (featuring Buck Rogers and The Skylark of Space). By 1930, Weisinger was active in some of the earliest SF fan clubs and fanzines, including &quot;The Planet&quot;. In 1931, Weisinger hosted a meeting of pioneer SF fan club &quot;The Scienceers&quot;, which was attended by a young Julius Schwartz, who recalled that the two became &quot;very friendly... [and] got along well together.&quot; A year later, Weisinger, Schwartz and Allen Glasser joined fellow-future professional editor Forrest J. Ackerman in founding &quot;The Time Traveller&quot;, which they styled &quot;Science Fiction&#x27;s Only Fan Magazine&quot;. The claim was more than mere youthful bravado, according to SF historian Sam Moskowitz, who described the &#x27;zine as the first devoted entirely to science fiction. Drawing on information they had gleaned from writing letters to the SF magazines and authors of the day, the young fans published interviews with, and short pieces by, established SF writers, and in the process gained increasing familiarity with the personalities and situations of the genre in that era. The first issue featured &quot;a one-page biography of Edward &#x27;Doc&#x27; Smith... [and] some news items.&quot;

===Early career===
After high school, Weisinger attended New York University, where he worked as editor of the college&#x27;s newspaper and magazine, but left before graduating. With Schwartz, he approached the editor of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; (T. Connor Sloane) and &quot;sold his first story&quot;: &#x27;The Price of Peace&#x27;. In late 1934, Weisinger suggested that he and Schwartz &quot;ought to go into the agency business,&quot; noting (according to Schwartz) that the duo had
Schwartz concurred, and they formed the Solar Sales Service (&quot;We always believed in alliteration,&quot; noted Schwartz), the first literary agency to specialize in the related genres of SF, horror, and fantasy. Edmond Hamilton was the agency&#x27;s first client, and Otto Binder soon followed. Solar Sales eventually represented many prominent SF and fantasy writers, including John Russell Fearn, Alfred Bester, Stanley Weinbaum, H. P. Lovecraft, and Ray Bradbury. But while Schwartz continued the agency into the early 1940s, Weisinger moved on; he took a job with the Standard Magazine chain, publisher of a range of pulp magazines. Standard had acquired writer-publisher Hugo Gernsback&#x27;s defunct &quot;Wonder Stories&quot; and added it to Standard series of &quot;Thrilling&quot; publications (&quot;Thrilling Detective,&quot; &quot;Thrilling Western&quot;, and others). Weisinger became the editor of &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories,&quot; and bought stories by Hamilton and others from his former partner Schwartz. Weisinger was soon editing a range of other pulps by Standard, including &quot;Startling Stories&quot; and &quot;Captain Future&quot;, and &quot;was in charge of no fewer than 40 titles&quot; by 1940.

==National Periodical Publications (DC Comics)==
===Army service===
In March 1941, Weisinger moved from Standard Magazines to National Periodicals (later DC Comics) primarily as editor of the &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Batman&quot; titles. Among his earliest jobs, however, was the task of &quot;dream[ing] up some new characters&quot; – these resulted in the line-up of &quot;More Fun Comics&quot; #73, and took the form of Aquaman, Green Arrow, Johnny Quick and Vigilante. Weisinger&#x27;s fledgling career was soon interrupted when he was conscripted in 1942, and he served as a sergeant in Special Services. Stationed at Yale (and rooming with Broderick Crawford and William Holden), he wrote scripts for a U.S. Army &quot;radio show called &#x27;I Sustain the Wings&#x27; &quot; in New York City.

He met and married (Sept. 27, 1943) his wife, the former Thelma Rudnick. They had two children, a daughter, Joyce, and son, Hendrie.

===Superman innovations===
Weisinger returned to his job at National after his discharge from military service in 1946, and resumed his editorship of the Superman comics, the Batman titles and others. His tenure was marked by the introduction of a variety of new concepts and supporting characters, including Supergirl, Krypto the Superdog, the Phantom Zone, the bottle city of Kandor, the Legion of Super-Heroes, and a variety of types of kryptonite. Attempting to rationalize Superman&#x27;s powers, it was under Weisinger&#x27;s watch that the &quot;concept that in a world circling a yellow sun [as opposed to Krypton&#x27;s red sun] his [Superman&#x27;s] powers are multiplied&quot; came to be introduced to the Superman mythology.

Realizing that &quot;Batman was my favorite [character],&quot; Weisinger realised that the crucial difference was that &quot;Batman can get hurt.&quot; In order to better allow the reader to identify with the invulnerable Man of Steel, Weisinger frequently featured stories in which &quot;Superman lost his powers and had to survive on his natural wits.&quot; Pitted against Superman&#x27;s wits was Lois Lane, and under Weisinger&#x27;s editorship stories in which she sought to prove that Superman was Clark Kent abounded.

Weisinger &quot;enjoyed surprising the readers,&quot; and to that end introduced a number of &quot;live personalities... real people&quot; into the comics, including &quot;Candid Camera&quot;&#x27;s Allen Funt, &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;&#x27;s Ralph Edwards, Steve Allen, Ann Blyth and Pat Boone among others. Weisinger was particularly &quot;proud of having dreamed up the &quot;imaginary story&quot; gimmick to motivate otherwise impossible stories,&quot; (non-canonical &#x27;what if...?&#x27; scenarios not bound to series or character continuity, timeframe or logic), and for &quot;having conceived the idea of DC&#x27;s first giant anthology - The Superman Annual.&quot;

===&quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot;===

Weisinger &quot;eventually gave up editorship of Batman and many of the other magazines and concentrated on the #1 superhero,&quot; both in the comics and elsewhere. In the early 1950s, he was &quot;called out to California by Whitney Ellsworth . . . to work as story editor for the Superman TV series.&quot; Weisinger recalled in 1975 about this experience that

Through Weisinger&#x27;s previous &quot;experience with television,&quot; Reeves landed &quot;a guest star spot, &quot;Big Red S&quot; and all, on the &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; show.&quot;

Weisinger&#x27;s influences on up-and-coming writers in SF and comics also extended, by these means, to television. Jackson Gillis was shepherded from his work on &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; to &quot;Perry Mason&quot; and &quot;Columbo&quot; (alongside many, many other credits). Weisinger also highlights David Chantler, William Woolfolk and Leigh Brackett as &quot;examples of proteges and associates who have surpassed him in term of success.&quot;

===Superman editorship===
Weisinger was sole editor of all of the Superman titles from 1958 until his retirement from comics in 1970.

Many of Weisinger&#x27;s ideas came from talking to kids in his neighborhood, asking them what they wanted to see, and then attempting to riff on those ideas. Such talks inspired him to create the &quot;Lois Lane&quot; and &quot;Jimmy Olsen&quot; spin-off titles &quot;over a lot of opposition&quot; from the management who &quot;protested that the characters weren&#x27;t strong enough.&quot; Weisinger later bought a story from Jim Shooter while unaware of the writer&#x27;s age, and hired him for a popular run on &quot;The Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; even after discovering that he was only 14 years old.

Weisinger encouraged a static picture book style of illustration in his stories, and was known for reusing previously published stories as new story ideas. A noted example of this is a 1950s story featuring Superman encountering an alien being he thought might have been his long-lost brother; this was reused in the early 1960s as a Superboy story introducing Mon-El.

Over time, Weisinger found himself growing disenchanted, and even embarrassed to reveal his primary job, saying &quot;When people asked me what I did for a living, I would suppress the fact that I was editing Superman. I&#x27;d tell people that I wrote for &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; or &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;.&quot; He recalls that he attempted to get himself removed from his editorial position by &quot;asking for bigger and bigger raises,&quot; but instead found his demands met – even to the extent that he was given &quot;generous stock options&quot; and &quot;made a vice president of public relations for the company.&quot; He did eventually leave, and bought himself a white Cadillac to &quot;bolster my ego.&quot;

===Management style===
Weisinger was criticized by some for having a micromanaging attitude and a heavy-handed, overbearing treatment of his writers and artists. He was well known for his abusive treatment of the DC employees. Indeed, his son also confirms he was abusive to restaurant waiters as well. Criticism has also been leveled at Weisinger for quashing creativity by dictating storylines. Jim Shooter, who wrote for years under his editorship, praised Weisinger&#x27;s &quot;rules&quot; for writing comics but criticized his rigid adherence to them: &quot;. . . Mort’s rules &quot;always&quot; worked, story-mechanics-wise. Easy, idiot-proof, safe. Trying things that explored the frontiers beyond the confines of Mort’s rules was tricky—fraught with opportunities to fail—but if you were daring, if you had the necessary depth of understanding and the skills, you could do wonderful things.&quot;[emphasis in original] Weisinger has commented, &quot;People have always accused me of being an egomaniac as an editor because I always gave the writers my own plots. I did that for a reason. If I asked a writer to bring in his own plots, and he spent a weekend on four of them, and I didn&#x27;t like any of the four, then he&#x27;s &quot;wasted&quot; a whole weekend. . . . . The least I could do was to think of a plot for the writer and if he liked it – I&#x27;d never force it down his throat – we&#x27;d kick it around and evolve a story.&quot;

One concept Weisinger brought to comics from the pulps was creating a story &quot;around a pre-drawn cover,&quot; a concept taken up across the industry, most notably by colleague Julius Schwartz. During Weisinger&#x27;s reign, the Superman comics maintained a reasonably tight internal continuity, but related little to the rest of the DC Universe. Weisinger was succeeded in 1970 by his childhood friend and longtime colleague Julius Schwartz. Weisinger was later immortalized within the Superman comics &quot;as a bust in Clark Kent&#x27;s apartment.&quot;

==Articles and books==
In addition to his SF agency and extensive editorial work for DC Comics, Weisinger found time – particularly after his retirement from DC – to write a considerable number of articles for a wide variety of magazines. Weisinger was reported, in 1975, as having &quot;had articles in &quot;The Journal of the AMA&quot;, &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;... [and] &quot;Parade&quot;.&quot; His articles ranged from one on the Comics Code for &quot;Better Homes and Gardens&quot; to an article entitled &quot;How Ralph Edwards Fools &#x27;Em&quot; for which he &quot;accompanied Edwards on several &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; escapades to get the story of how the clever impresario suckered the celebrities whom he was to honor on his popular &#x27;50s show.&quot;

Weisinger occasionally contributed articles to the writers&#x27; magazines – &quot;Writer&#x27;s Digest&quot;, &quot;The Author &amp; Journalist&quot;, etc. – from the 1930s through the 1950s.

Weisinger had a particular interest in beauty contests, writing an article for &quot;Parade&quot; on &quot;why certain finalists in the Miss America pageant can never win the crown,&quot; as well as a &quot;best-selling novel&quot; entitled &quot;The Contest&quot; (published in hardback by World, and in paperback by New American Library). Weisinger had once been a &quot;judge in a preliminary Miss America contest,&quot; through which he &quot;learned the inside story,&quot; later travelling to Europe with the then-&quot;world-famous host of the real-life contest,&quot; a friend of Weisinger&#x27;s at the time who refused to talk to him again after reading the resulting novel. For the author, however, &quot;The Contest&quot; netted a $125,000 movie option and &quot;printings in several foreign languages.&quot;

Weisinger&#x27;s best known book was &quot;a compendium of freebies available to anyone&quot; entitled &quot;1001 Valuable Things You Can Get For Free&quot;, first published in 1955 and which (as of 1975) had &quot;gone through 41 paperback printings and sold over three million copies.&quot; Weisinger&#x27;s book was praised by Abbie Hoffman in &quot;Steal This Book&quot;, and earned its author a place in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot;.

==Later life==
Weisinger lived for much of his life in Great Neck, New York, and stayed there until his death from a heart attack. In 1985, he was posthumously named as one of the honorees by DC Comics in the company&#x27;s 50th anniversary publication &quot;Fifty Who Made DC Great&quot;.

<doc id="540943" wikidata="Q4223026" url="?curid=540943" title="Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education">
<text>The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, or simply the Carnegie Classification, is a framework for classifying colleges and universities in the United States. It was created in 1970 by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. It is managed by the American Council on Education.

The framework primarily serves educational and research purposes, where it is often important to identify groups of roughly comparable institutions. The classification generally focuses on types of degrees awarded and related level of activity such as research. The classification includes all accredited, degree-granting colleges and universities in the United States that are represented in the National Center for Education Statistics&#x27; Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS).

==History==
The Carnegie Classification was created by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education in 1970. The classification was first published in 1973 with updates in 1976, 1987, 1994, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2018 and 2021. To ensure continuity of the classification framework and to allow comparison across years, the 2015 Classification update retains the same structure of six parallel classifications, initially adopted in 2005. The 2005 report substantially reworked the classification system, based on data from the 2002–2003 and 2003–2004 school years.

In 2015, the Carnegie Foundation transferred responsibility for the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education to the Center for Postsecondary Research of the Indiana University School of Education in Bloomington, Indiana. The voluntary Classification on Community Engagement is managed by the Public Purpose Institute at Albion College. In March 2022, the universal and elective Carnegie classifications moved to the nonprofit American Council on Education in Washington, D.C.

Information used in these classifications comes primarily from IPEDS and the College Board.

==Basic classification==
The number of institutions in each category is indicated in parentheses.

===Doctorate-granting universities===
&quot;Doctorate-granting universities&quot; are institutions that awarded at least 20 research/scholarly doctorates in the update year (the most recent being a minor update in 2021). Professional doctorates (D.D.S., J.D., M.D., Pharm.D., etc.) are not included in this count but were added as a separate criterion in 2018–19. The framework further classifies these universities by their level of research activity as measured by research expenditures, number of research doctorates awarded, number of research-focused faculty, and other factors. A detailed list of schools can be found in the list of research universities in the United States.

*&quot;R1: Doctoral universities – very high research activity&quot; (146)
*&quot;R2: Doctoral universities – high research activity&quot; (133)
*&quot;D/PU: Doctoral/professional universities&quot; (187)

===Master&#x27;s colleges and universities===

&quot;Master&#x27;s colleges and universities&quot; are institutions that &quot;awarded at least 50 master&#x27;s degrees in 2013–14, but fewer than 20 doctorates.&quot;

* &quot;M1: Master&#x27;s colleges and universities: larger programs&quot; are larger programs that awarded at least 200 master&#x27;s-level degrees (325)
* &quot;M2: Master&#x27;s colleges and universities: medium programs&quot; are medium programs that awarded 100–199 master&#x27;s-level degrees (185)
* &quot;M3: Master&#x27;s colleges and universities: small programs&quot; are smaller programs that awarded 50–99 master&#x27;s-level degrees (159)

===Baccalaureate colleges===

&quot;Baccalaureate colleges&quot; are institutions where &quot;bachelor&#x27;s degrees accounted for at least 10 percent of all undergraduate degrees and they awarded fewer than 50 master&#x27;s degrees (2013–14-degree conferrals).&quot;

*&quot;Arts &amp; sciences focus&quot; (225)
*&quot;Diverse fields&quot; (308)

===Baccalaureate/associate&#x27;s colleges===
*&quot;Associate&#x27;s dominant&quot; (103)
*&quot;Mixed baccalaureate/associate&#x27;s&quot; (99)

===Associate&#x27;s colleges===
&quot;Associate&#x27;s colleges&quot; are institutions whose highest degree is the associate degree.

High transfer
*&quot;High traditional&quot; (106)
*&quot;Mixed traditional/nontraditional&quot; (102)
*&quot;High nontraditional&quot; (109)

Mixed transfer/career and technical
*&quot;High traditional&quot; (104)
*&quot;Mixed traditional/nontraditional&quot; (97)
*&quot;High nontraditional&quot; (115)

===Special focus institutions===
&quot;Special Focus Institutions&quot; were classified &quot;based on the concentration of degrees in a single field or set of related fields, at both undergraduate and graduate levels. Institutions were determined to have a special focus with concentrations of at least 80 percent of undergraduate and graduate degrees. In some cases this percentage criterion was relaxed if an institution identified a special focus on the College Board&#x27;s Annual Survey of Colleges, or if an institution&#x27;s only accreditation was from a body related to the special focus categories&quot;.

Two-year
*&quot;Health professions&quot; (206)
*&quot;Arts &amp; design&quot; (28)
*&quot;Technical professions&quot; (52)
*&quot;Other fields&quot; (54)

Four-year
*&quot;Faith-related institutions&quot; (246)
*&quot;Medical schools and centers&quot; (38)
*&quot;Other health professions schools&quot; (243)
*&quot;Research institution&quot; (23)
*&quot;Engineering and other technology-related schools&quot; (12)
*&quot;Business and management schools&quot; (49)
*&quot;Arts, music, and design schools&quot; (71)
*&quot;Law schools&quot; (31)
*&quot;Other special focus institutions&quot; (33)

===Tribal Colleges===
&quot;Tribal Colleges&quot; are institutions that belong to the &quot;American Indian Higher Education Consortium.&quot;

*Tribal colleges and universities (35)

==Undergraduate instructional program==
The &quot;Undergraduate Instructional Program&quot; classification combines (a) the ratio of Arts and sciences and professional fields (as defined in the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP)) and (b) the coexistence of programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels (again using the CIP).

===Arts and sciences and professional fields===
The framework categorizes institutions based on the proportion of undergraduate majors in arts and sciences or professional fields, based on their two-digit CIP.

* &quot;Associates Only (Assoc)&quot; only award associate degrees.
* &quot;Associates Dominant (Assoc-Dom)&quot; award some bachelor&#x27;s degrees, but award more associates&#x27;s degrees.
* &quot;Arts &amp; Sciences Focus (A&amp;S-F)&quot; award least 80 percent of undergraduate degrees in the arts and sciences.
* &quot;Arts &amp; Sciences + Professions (A&amp;S+Prof)&quot; award between 80 and 59 percent of undergraduate degrees in the arts and sciences.
* &quot;Balanced Arts &amp; Sciences/Professions (Bal)&quot; award 41 to 59 percent of undergraduate degrees in each domain.
* &quot;Professions + Arts &amp; Sciences (Prof+A&amp;S)&quot; award between 80 and 59 percent of undergraduate degrees in a professional field.
* &quot;Professions Focus (Prof-F)&quot; award at least 80 percent of undergraduate degrees in a professional field.

===Graduate coexistence===
The framework categorizes institutions based on the proportion of undergraduate and graduate programs (defined by their 4-digit CIP) that coexist.

* &quot;No coexistence (NGC)&quot;—no programs coexist.
* &quot;Some coexistence (SGC)&quot;—some graduate programs coexist with undergraduate programs but fewer than half.
* &quot;High coexistence (HGC)&quot;—at least half of the graduate programs coexist with undergraduate programs.

==Graduate instructional program==
The &quot;Graduate Instructional Program&quot; classification indicates (a) if the institution awards just master&#x27;s degrees or master&#x27;s degrees and doctoral degrees, and (b) in what general categories they predominantly award graduate degrees. Institutions that do not award graduate degrees are not classified by this scheme.

===Postbaccalaureate graduate programs===
Institutions that offer graduate and professional programs (such as law schools) but do not award the doctorate are classified as having &quot;Postbaccalaureate&quot; graduate programs. These programs are classified by the fields in which the degrees are awarded.

*Single postbaccalaureate (education) (S-PostBac/Ed)&quot;—only offer graduate training in education.
*&quot;Single postbaccalaureate (business) (S-PostBac/Bus)&quot;—only offer graduate training in business.
*&quot;Single postbaccalaureate (other field) (S-PostBac/Other)&quot;—only offer graduate training in a field other than education or business.
*&quot;Postbaccalaureate comprehensive (PostBac-Comp)&quot;—offer graduate training in the humanities, social sciences, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Medicine (STEM), and one or more professional fields.
*&quot;Postbaccalaureate, arts &amp; sciences dominant (PostBac-A&amp;S)&quot;—only offer graduate training in the arts and sciences.
*&quot;Postbaccalaureate with arts &amp; sciences (education dominant) (PostBac-A&amp;S/Ed)—&quot;offer graduate training primarily in the arts and sciences with some training in education.
*&quot;Postbaccalaureate with arts &amp; sciences (business dominant) (PostBac-A&amp;S/Bus)&quot;—offer graduate training primarily in the arts and sciences with some training in business.
*&quot;Postbaccalaureate with arts &amp; sciences (other dominant fields) (PostBac-A&amp;S/Other)&quot;—offer graduate training primarily in the arts and sciences with some training in a field other than education or business.
*&quot;Postbaccalaureate professional (education dominant) (PostBac-Prof/Ed)&quot;—offer graduate training primarily in professional fields with some training in education.
*&quot;Postbaccalaureate professional (business dominant) (PostBac-Prof/Bus)&quot;—offer graduate training primarily in professional fields with some training in business.
*&quot;Postbaccalaureate professional (other dominant fields) (PostBac-Prof/Other)&quot;—offer graduate training primarily in professional fields with some training in a field other than education or business.

===Doctoral degree programs===
Institutions that offer doctoral degrees, including medical and veterinary degrees, are classified by the field in which they award degrees.

*&quot;Single doctoral (education) (S-Doc/Ed)&quot; only award doctoral degrees in education.
*&quot;Single doctoral (other field) (S-Doc/Other)&quot; only award doctoral degrees in a single non-education field.
*&quot;Comprehensive doctoral with medical/veterinary (CompDoc/MedVet)&quot; (a) award doctorates in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM fields, (b) graduate or professional degrees in one or more professional fields, and (c) award medical or veterinary doctoral degrees.
*&quot;Comprehensive doctoral (no medical/veterinary) (CompDoc/NMedVet)&quot; (a) award doctorates in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM fields, (b) graduate or professional degrees in one or more professional fields, and (c) do not award medical or veterinary doctoral degrees.
*&quot;Doctoral, humanities/social sciences dominant (Doc/HSS)&quot; award most of their doctorates in the humanities and social sciences.
*&quot;Doctoral, STEM dominant (Doc/STEM)&quot; award most of their doctorates in STEM fields.
*&quot;Doctoral, professional dominant (Doc/Prof)&quot; award most of their doctorates are awarded in professional fields other than engineering.

==Enrollment profile==
The Enrollment Profile of institutions are classified according to (a) the level of the highest degree awarded and (b) the ratio of undergraduate to graduate students.

*&quot;Exclusively undergraduate two-year (ExU2)&quot;—students are not awarded bachelor&#x27;s or higher degrees.
*&quot;Exclusively undergraduate four-year (ExU4)&quot;—students are only awarded bachelor&#x27;s degrees.
*&quot;Very high undergraduate (VHU)&quot;—fewer than 10 percent of students are graduate students.
*&quot;High undergraduate (HU)&quot;—more than 10 percent, but fewer than 25 percent of students are graduate students.
*&quot;Majority undergraduate (MU)&quot;—more than 24 percent, but fewer than 50 percent of students are graduate students.
*&quot;Majority graduate/professional (MGP)&quot;—fewer than 50 percent of students are undergraduates.
*&quot;Exclusively graduate/professional (ExGP)—&quot;students are only awarded degrees higher than bachelor&#x27;s.

==Undergraduate profile==
The framework classifies institutions&#x27; &quot;Undergraduate Profile&quot; according to (a) the proportion of part-time undergraduate students to full-time students, (b) the institutions selectivity in admitting undergraduate students, and (c) the percentage of students who transfer into the university.

===Enrollment status===
The framework classifies &quot;Enrollment Status&quot; according to the ratio of part-time to full-time students (degree seeking students in four-year institutions).
*&quot;PT2&quot;: Higher part-time two-year—more than 60 percent of students at this 2-year institution are part-time.
*&quot;Mix2&quot;: Mixed part/full-time two-year—between 39 and 60 percent of students at this 2-year institution are part-time.
*&quot;MFT2&quot;: Medium full-time two-year—more than 60 but fewer than 91 percent of students at this 2-year institution are full-time.
*&quot;FT2&quot;: Higher full-time two-year—more than 90 percent of students at this 2-year institution are full-time.
*&quot;PT4&quot;: Higher part-time four-year—more than 39 percent of students at this 4-year or higher institution are part-time.
*&quot;MFT4&quot;: Medium full-time four-year—more than 60 percent but fewer than 80 percent of students at this 4-year or higher institution are full-time.
*&quot;FT4&quot;: Full-time four-year—more than 79 percent of students at this 4-year or higher institution are full-time.

===Achievement characteristics/selectivity===
&quot;Selectivity&quot; is classified according to the SAT and ACT scores of first-time first-year students. This classification only applies to four-year or higher institutions. As of the 2010 edition the criteria were as follows (http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org/methodology/ugrad_profile.php)
*&quot;Inclusive (I)&quot;—students had a 25th percentile ACT-equivalent score below 18.
*&quot;Selective (S)&quot;—students had a 25th percentile ACT-equivalent score from 18 to 21.
*&quot;More Selective (MS)&quot;—students had a 25th percentile ACT-equivalent score greater than 21.

===Transfer origin===
&quot;Transfer origin&quot; characterizes the percentage of students who transfer to the institution, and only applies to four-year or higher institutions.
*&quot;Lower transfer-in (LTI)&quot;—fewer than 20 percent of students transfer into the institution.
*&quot;Higher transfer-in (HTI)&quot;—more than 19 percent of students transfer into the institution.

==Size and setting==
&quot;Size and Setting&quot; classifies institutions according to (a) size of their student body and (b) percentage of student who reside on campus. This does not apply to exclusively graduate and professional institutions and special-focus institutions.

===Size===
The &quot;size&quot; of institutions is based on their &quot;full-time equivalent (FTE)&quot; enrollment. FTEs are calculated by adding the number of full-time students to one-third the number of part-time students. Two-year colleges are classified using a different scale than four-year and higher institutions.

*&quot;Very small two-year (VS2)&quot;—fewer than 500 FTEs attend this two-year institution.
*&quot;Small two-year (S2)&quot;—at least 500 but fewer than 2000 FTEs attend this two-year institution.
*&quot;Medium two-year (M2)&quot;—at least 2000 but fewer than 5000 FTEs attend this two-year institution.
*&quot;Large two-year (L2)&quot;—at least 5000 but fewer than 10000 FTEs attend this two-year institution.
*&quot;Very large two-year (VL2)&quot;—10000 or more FTEs attend this two-year institution.
*&quot;Very small four-year (VS4)&quot;—fewer than 1000 FTEs attend this four-year institution.
*&quot;Small four-year (S4)&quot;—at least 1000 but fewer than 3000 FTEs attend this four-year institution.
*&quot;Medium four-year (M4)&quot;—at least 3000 but fewer than 10000 FTEs attend this four-year institution.
*&quot;Large four-year (L4)&quot;—more than 10000 FTEs attend this four-year institution.

===Setting===
&quot;Setting&quot; is based on the percentage of full-time undergraduates who live in institutionally-managed housing. Two-year institutions are not classified by setting.
*&quot;Primarily nonresidential (NR)&quot;—fewer than 25 percent of degree-seeking undergraduates or fewer than 50 percent enrolled full-time live on campus.
*&quot;Primarily residential (R): (a)&quot;—at least 25 percent of degree-seeking undergraduates live on campus and (b) at least 50 percent but fewer than 80 percent attend full-time.
*&quot;Highly residential (HR)&quot;—at least half of degree-seeking undergraduates live on campus and at least 80 percent attend full-time.

==2005 edition==
The 2005 classification scheme introduced a &quot;set of multiple, parallel classifications&quot; that are &quot;organized around three central questions: 1) What is taught, 2) to whom, and 3) in what setting?&quot; wrote Alexander McCormick, a senior scholar at the Carnegie Foundation and director of the classifications project. 

As of 2005, the Carnegie Foundation was developing one or more voluntary classification schemes that rely on data submitted by institutions. The first focuses on outreach and community engagement, and the second on &quot;how institutions seek to analyze, understand, and improve undergraduate education.&quot;

The Carnegie Foundation has no plans to issue printed editions of the classifications. Their website has several tools that let researchers and administrators view classifications.

===Revisions in the basic classification===
The 2005 revision also introduced the &quot;basic classification&quot;, an update of the original classification scheme that:

# Changes the names of some categories.
# Splits Associates colleges into subcategories. This is based on the work of Stephen Katsinas, Vincent Lacey, and David Hardy at the University of Alabama and is an update of work funded in the 1990s by the Ford Foundation.
# Categorizes doctorate-granting institutions according to their level of research activity. This level is calculated using multiple measures, financial and otherwise.
# Simplifies the measurement of doctorate degrees awarded.
# Divides Master&#x27;s colleges and universities into three categories based on the number of Master&#x27;s degrees awarded.
# Deprecates &quot;Liberal Arts&quot; terminology.
# Modified the criteria separating Master&#x27;s and Baccalaureate institutions. Institutions formerly classified as Master&#x27;s Colleges and Universities are now classified as Baccalaureate Colleges.
# Requires institutions to have higher levels of single-field or related-field concentration for designation as special-focus institutions and utilizes more sources of information to identify special-focus institutions.
# Splits the &quot;Schools of engineering and technology&quot; category into two categories and eliminates the &quot;Teacher&#x27;s colleges&quot; category.
# Measures and classifies service academies using the same criteria as other institutions.

<doc id="540947" wikidata="Q902413" url="?curid=540947" title="Wheels of Fire">
<text>Wheels of Fire is the third studio album by the British rock band Cream. It was released in the US on 14 June 1968 as a two-disc vinyl LP, with one disc recorded in the studio and the other recorded live. It was released in the UK in the same format on August 9. 

==Recording==
Cream&#x27;s third album was planned to be a double album which would include several live performances. Unlike &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot;, which had been recorded in a matter of days, the &quot;Wheels of Fire&quot; sessions took place in small bursts over nearly a year. The recording engineers on disc one were Tom Dowd and Adrian Barber. The live performances on disc two were recorded by Bill Halverson and mixed by Adrian Barber.

Sessions with producer Felix Pappalardi began in July and August 1967 at IBC Studios in London, months before the release of &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot;, with the basic tracks for &quot;White Room&quot;, &quot;Sitting on Top of the World&quot;, and &quot;Born Under a Bad Sign&quot; put to tape. Jack Bruce expressed the band&#x27;s preference for working with Pappalardi and Dowd, as well as the new unhurried atmosphere contrasted with the first two albums: &quot;We&#x27;re all temperamental but Tom...and Felix manage to get rid of that temperament...We spend a long time in the studio, so we don&#x27;t have to rush. We usually talk for hours before we record anything, then we play, think and add sounds&quot;. Recordings continued with short sessions at Atlantic Studios in September and October 1967 where overdubs were added to the aforementioned three songs along with basic tracks for &quot;Pressed Rat and Warthog&quot; and the non-LP single &quot;Anyone for Tennis&quot;. After more overdubs in mid-December, further work took place at Atlantic from 13–22 February 1968, during a break from the band&#x27;s heavy tour schedule, where basic tracks for &quot;Politician&quot;, &quot;Passing The Time&quot;, &quot;Deserted Cities of the Heart&quot; and &quot;As You Said&quot; were laid down along with further work on the previous tracks. 

The following month, Pappalardi ordered that a mobile recording studio in Los Angeles be shipped to The Fillmore Auditorium and Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco. Six shows were recorded at both venues from 7–10 March by Pappalardi and recording engineer Bill Halverson, with extra performances not included on &quot;Wheels of Fire&quot; ending up on &quot;Live Cream&quot; and &quot;Live Cream Volume II&quot;. Further recordings and mixing for the album were completed at Atlantic Studios in June 1968, nearly a year after they had started, with the completion of &quot;White Room&quot;, &quot;Passing the Time&quot;, &quot;Deserted Cities of the Heart&quot;, &quot;As You Said&quot; and the recording of a final number, &quot;Those Were the Days&quot;. By this point, recording at the end of two exhausting back-to-back tours of America, tensions between the band members had become considerably strained. The album was then rushed to shops in the US by mid-June. 

==Songs==
The band&#x27;s drummer Ginger Baker co-wrote three songs for the album (&quot;Passing the Time&quot;, &quot;Pressed Rat and Warthog&quot;, and &quot;Those Were the Days&quot;) with jazz pianist Mike Taylor. Baker later admitted that &quot;Pressed Rat and Warthog&quot; was an inside joke, based on the bawdy imagery referred to by its title. Bassist Jack Bruce co-wrote four songs with poet Pete Brown including &quot;White Room&quot;, &quot;As You Said&quot; (the only Cream recording which does not feature Clapton), &quot;Politician&quot; and &quot;Deserted Cities of the Heart&quot;. In an interview, Pete Brown revealed that the lyrics to &quot;White Room&quot; were condensed from an eight page poem he had written when he moved into a new white-walled apartment room with bare furnishings, where he gave up drinking and drugs. &quot;Politician&quot; came together quickly for a January 1968 BBC radio session when, needing one more track, Bruce came up with a riff which Brown, who was present in the studio, thought was perfect to match with lines of a poem he&#x27;d written several years earlier; the song was finished and recorded for broadcast that day. Guitarist Eric Clapton contributed to the album by choosing two blues songs to cover, the standard &quot;Sitting on Top of the World&quot; and Booker T. Jones&#x27;s &quot;Born Under a Bad Sign&quot;, which had been the title track to the recent Albert King album of the same name. Production on the studio disc was more elaborate than that for the first two albums, with the addition of exotic instrumentation including glockenspiel, calliope, cello, trumpet, bells, viola and tonette creating a psychedelic feel, with the three blues numbers featuring the group&#x27;s basic three piece sound. 

For the second disc, Felix Pappalardi chose &quot;Traintime&quot; because it featured Jack Bruce&#x27;s singing and harmonica playing, &quot;Toad&quot; because it featured Ginger Baker&#x27;s lengthy drum solo, while &quot;Spoonful&quot; and &quot;Crossroads&quot; were used to showcase Eric Clapton&#x27;s guitar work. All four songs had been a part of their set list since the band&#x27;s beginnings in 1966, as shown by several early BBC performances. 

==Cover art==
The artwork for the album was by Martin Sharp, who had co-written &quot;Tales of Brave Ulysses&quot; and &quot;Anyone for Tennis&quot; with Clapton and also done the artwork for &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot;. The front and back covers consisted of a silver-grey psychedelic drawing, with the inner gatefold consisting of a similar drawing, only in Day-Glo colors of orange, green, pink and yellow. The photography was by Jim Marshall.

==Release==
&quot;Wheels of Fire&quot; was released by Atco in the US on June 14, 1968, with a UK release on Polydor following on August 9. It was an instant blockbuster success, charting at No. 3 in the United Kingdom and No. 1 in the United States, Canada and Australia, becoming the world&#x27;s first platinum-selling double album. The album&#x27;s release, however, was accompanied by an announcement on July 10 that the band was going to split up by the end of the year, citing a loss of direction.

The album was also released as two single LPs, &quot;Wheels of Fire (In the Studio)&quot; and &quot;Wheels of Fire (Live at the Fillmore)&quot;, with similar cover art. In the UK the studio album art was black print on aluminum foil, while the live album art was a negative image of the studio cover; &quot;In the Studio&quot; charted as high as No. 7 in that country, although it possibly took from sales of the double disc set. In Japan, the studio album art was black on gold foil, while the live album art was black on aluminium foil. In Australia, both covers were laminated copies of the Japanese releases.

==Reception and legacy==
In England, critical reception to the album was highly positive. In a lengthy review, Chris Welch of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; began by noting &quot;If Cream have been disappointing on record in the past...their long awaited double album is sufficient to restore the faith of the most errant disciple&quot;, praising the group&#x27;s taste and restraint on tracks like &quot;As You Said&quot; and enthusing that the live disc was &quot;electrifying&quot;. &quot;Record Mirror&quot; said the record should be subtitled &quot;to remind us of all that was best about the Cream live and in the studio&quot;, concluding that as the band wouldn&#x27;t be around for much longer, it was a must for everyone&#x27;s collection. &quot;Disc &amp; Music Echo&quot; labelled it &quot;Best LP of the month&quot; and &quot;a fitting--at times superb--memorial to Britain&#x27;s best live group&quot; with the best material they had put on record. In the United States, Jann Wenner at &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave a poor review to the studio disc, singling out &quot;As You Said&quot; and &quot;Politician&quot; as the only worthwhile tracks and stating of &quot;White Room&quot; that it is a too-close duplication of &quot;Tales of Brave Ulysses&quot; with a &quot;Sonny Bono-ish production job that adds little&quot;; however, he praised the live disc, stating of &quot;Spoonful&quot; that &quot;this is the kind of thing that people who have seen Cream perform walk away raving about and it’s good to at last have it on a record&quot;. In a more positive review, &quot;Cashbox&quot; predicted that the album would see heavy sales action. 

Retrospectively, the album has been cited a classic of the era. Writing in &quot;The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot;, Colin Larkin said the live disc captured the group at their &quot;inventive and exploratory best&quot;. In a four-star review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine at AllMusic notes that the album &quot;is indeed filled with Cream&#x27;s very best work, since it captures the fury and invention (and indulgence) of the band at its peak on the stage and in the studio, but...doesn&#x27;t quite add up to something greater than the sum of its parts. But taken alone, those individual parts are often quite tremendous&quot;. David Bowling at &quot;The Daily Vault&quot; gushed that the album has &quot;withstood the test of time, remains one of the essential rock albums and should be required listening.&quot;

In May 2012, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked it at number 205 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, noting it is &quot;incontrovertible proof of Eric Clapton&#x27;s interpretive mastery&quot;. It was voted number 757 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).

==Track listing==

<text>Animal Crossing is a 2001 social simulation game developed and published by Nintendo for the GameCube. It was released in Japan on December 14, 2001, and the following years internationally. The game is an enhanced version of the Nintendo 64 game which was only released in Japan. It is the first game in the &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; series.

&quot;Animal Crossing&quot; is an endless non-linear game in which the player takes up residence in a village inhabited by anthropomorphic animals. The goal is to save money to pay off the mortgage on the player&#x27;s house by collecting and selling natural materials. The player can engage in everyday life in the village, interact with the animals, attend events, and contribute to the village&#x27;s development. The western localization replaces Japanese holidays and cultural references with Western ones.

&quot;Animal Crossing&quot; was conceived as a role-playing adventure for the 64DD, with the main action taking place in dungeons. However, development was stalled by the repeated delays of the peripheral. Following the move to the standard cartridge format, co-director Katsuya Eguchi decided to refocus the game as a non-linear life simulator, which would carry the themes of family, friendship, and community and allow several players to develop a virtual town at different times.

&quot;Animal Crossing&quot; was a critical and commercial success domestically and internationally, attracting many non-traditional gaming audiences. Critics praised the game&#x27;s unusual but immersive and addictive gameplay, which was devoid of purpose and stressful elements. Criticisms centered on its outdated graphics and simple art style. The game is considered one of the earliest examples of the casual game genre, as well as one of the greatest games of all time.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Animal Crossing&quot; is a social simulation game, dubbed a &quot;communication game&quot; by Nintendo. It is open-ended, and the player&#x27;s character can live a separate life with very little set plot or mandatory tasks. Players assume the role of a new resident to the town. The gender and looks of the character depend on answers given to a cat named Rover, whom the player meets on the train the character takes to the town. There are also tasks that players can complete and goals they can achieve. The game is played in real-time, observing days, weeks, months and years using the GameCube&#x27;s internal clock. Many real-life events and holidays span the year, including Independence Day, Halloween, the Harvest Festival (Thanksgiving), and Toy Day (Christmas). Other activities, such as fishing tournaments and early-morning fitness classes, occur on a regular schedule. When players stop playing, they can talk to their Gyroid, a creature next to their house, to save their progress. If the player turns off the game or resets the GameCube without saving first, what they achieved during the previous unsaved game is lost, but everything else is kept; however a mole named Mr. Resetti appears in front of the player&#x27;s house the next time they play, to scold them for resetting and forces a drawn out conversation with the player. Rarely, Don Resetti will appear instead of Mr. Resetti, Don Resetti is the older brother of Mr. Resetti but they both have opposite personalities, Don Resetti advises the player of saving the game instead of getting angry at the player for not saving like Mr. Resetti.

One of the main goals of the game, given to the player during the game&#x27;s opening cut scenes, is to increase the size of the player&#x27;s character&#x27;s house. This house is the repository for furniture and other items acquired during the course of the game. It can be customized in several ways, such as roof colour, furniture, music, wallpaper and flooring. These customisations are judged by the Happy Room Academy (HRA).

Tom Nook, a tanuki (raccoon dog) in the Japanese versions and a raccoon in the American and European versions, runs the local store. At the beginning of the game, he gives the player their first house with a mortgage of 19,800 Bells (the in-game currency). After paying the debt, part of which is done through a part-time job with Nook, the house is expanded, prompting another debt from Nook. The house is expanded several times during the course of the game. Players can sell virtually anything to Nook in exchange for Bells. As the player buys and sells items at Nook&#x27;s store, it will gradually expand, offering a wider selection of products for purchase. Players can also visit locations such as the Able Sisters&#x27; clothing shop, where they can purchase or design new clothes; the Police Station, where they can obtain additional items from the Lost and Found; and the Museum, where they can donate fossils, paintings, fish and insects to put on display.

The village initially contains six villagers, and more villagers move in or out depending on the player&#x27;s actions. There is a maximum of fifteen villagers living there at a time. All villagers are animals and each has a home that the player can visit. There are many possible interactions between the player and the villagers, including talking, trading items, completing tasks, writing letters, and, in &quot;e+&quot;, buying medicine for when they get sick. Villagers interact with each other independent of player control.

===Multiplayer===
Up to four players can take turns creating their own houses in a single village. They can each affect the village in their own ways, communicate with each other via the town board and mail, and share in the experiences of the village. Multiple players can take turns shipping items to each other via Tom Nook, using a system of codes. Multiplayer NES games are available.

The traveling system allows each player to visit other players&#x27; villages. This system requires an additional memory card with the game&#x27;s data, and three blocks of memory to save travel data. Players can meet new villagers, shop at stores, drop items, and do almost anything else that they can do in their own town. Visitors have reduced privileges and do not receive the same services that they would in their own town. For example, another town&#x27;s Tom Nook will not travel to paint a roof, which means players cannot buy paint in another town. After visiting another town, one of the villagers may move to the visited town. If the visited town has a full fifteen villagers, this will prompt someone from the visited town to move away. Depending upon how many memory cards a player or their friends own, there can be many other villages to see and different items to find. If a player interacts with a villager who has moved away from their village to the visited village, the villager will remember the player.

===Game Boy Advance connectivity===
Game Boy Advance connectivity plays a role in &quot;Animal Crossing&quot;, using a Nintendo GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable. Each town has an island that can be accessed by plugging in a Game Boy Advance with a GameCube link cable. A character called Kapp&#x27;n ferries the player to the island for free. An exclusive animal roams the island, with whom the player can become friends. The island has an exclusive type of fruit: coconuts. The player can also decorate a small communal beach house and fish at the shores. On leaving, the player can download the island to a GBA and give fruit to the villager, who drops Bells; if the player returns to the island, they can pick up the money that has been dropped. Players can leave the islander tools to use, such as the shovel or net. Downloaded islands can be traded between GBAs, using a Game Boy Advance Link Cable.

The Game Boy Advance can be used when shopping at the Able Sisters. The pattern design tool can be downloaded to a Game Boy Advance, and the player can then upload designs made on a Game Boy Advance to the GameCube. This feature can be accessed by plugging in a Game Boy Advance with a GameCube Game Boy Advance Cable and talking to Mabel in the Able Sisters shop. The game is also compatible with the e-Reader; by visiting the Post Office while connected to the accessory via the Game Boy Advance link cable, players can scan &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; themed cards to receive new items, town tunes, or pattern designs.

===Nintendo Entertainment System games===
Players can collect various Nintendo Entertainment System games in &quot;Animal Crossing&quot;, which are playable via emulation. North American releases were packaged with a memory card that automatically gave the player two games upon creating a game file. Others are acquired in various ways, such as gifts from villagers, hidden on the island, or via special giveaways from Nintendo&#x27;s website. The available NES games differ slightly between each release.

The following NES games are available for play:

&quot;Dōbutsu no Mori+&quot; and &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; feature four additional NES games that are not obtainable in-game through normal means. &quot;Ice Climber&quot; was available in &quot;Dōbutsu no Mori+&quot; to players who used a service provided by Nintendo to transfer their save data from &quot;Dōbutsu no Mori&quot;. A memory card containing data to unlock &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; in &quot;Dōbutsu no Mori+&quot; was offered as a sweepstakes prize in issue #678 of &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine. In the North American &quot;Animal Crossing&quot;, both &quot;Ice Climber&quot; and &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; were available through the use of two e-Reader cards. &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; exists in the game&#x27;s code, but is not accessible in-game. These four bonus games can be obtained using a cheat device, but were removed in &quot;Dōbutsu no Mori e+&quot;.

The Advance Play feature allows players to link a Game Boy Advance to the GameCube and temporarily transfer the NES game to the handheld. This is not compatible with games that were originally produced for the Famicom Disk System, such as &quot;Clu Clu Land D&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, or are larger than 192 KB, such as &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; and &quot;Wario&#x27;s Woods&quot;, as they cannot fit into the GBA&#x27;s RAM. All other games can be played via Advance Play, but multiplayer functionality is not supported and their graphics appear slightly squashed on the GBA&#x27;s display due to its smaller vertical resolution.

An additional furniture item, resembling a Famicom Disk System in the Japanese versions and an NES in the English version, allows players to emulate other NES games not included within the base release by reading ROMs stored on the player&#x27;s Controller Pak or memory card. A special Nintendo 64 Controller Pak, containing a ROM of &quot;Ice Climber&quot; for use in &quot;Dōbutsu no Mori&quot;, was given away in limited quantities during June 2001 as a sweepstakes prize in magazines such as &quot;Famitsu&quot; and &quot;Nintendo Dream&quot;. However, no additional ROMs were ever distributed for the GameCube versions. In 2018, an independent software developer managed to reverse engineer the emulation software and convert ROMs into a compatible format, allowing new NES games to be imported into the &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; emulator.

The game was developed by Nintendo EAD with an inexperienced team led by Katsuya Eguchi, Hisashi Nogami, and Super Mario co-creator Takashi Tezuka, most of whom had regrouped after the release of &quot;Yoshi’s Story&quot; in 1997. The 64DD peripheral served as an enabling technology platform for the conception and development of the game, with its real-time clock and floppy disk for writable mass storage. Due to 64DD&#x27;s extended delays and cancellation, the game&#x27;s development was moved to the Game Pak cartridge mediumthe only Game Pak containing a real-time clockplus a Controller Pak for saving progress. Kazumi Totaka served as the game&#x27;s sound director. Kenta Nagata composed background music for the fields, Toru Minegishi for the indoor areas and Shinobu Tanaka for the events. The game was shown at Nintendo Space World 2000 and contained playable versions of &quot;Balloon Fight&quot;, &quot;Ice Climber&quot;, &quot;Clu Clu Land&quot;, and &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. It was originally released as &quot;Dōbutsu no Mori&quot; (lit. &quot;Animal Forest&quot;) on the Nintendo 64 in Japan in April 2001. It is the last game Nintendo released for the Nintendo 64, and third to last game released for the system in Japan.

The game was ported to the GameCube as &quot;Dōbutsu no Mori+&quot;, released on December 14, 2001, in Japan, eight months after the original game. This version contains extra features that were originally left out of the Nintendo 64 version, and uses the GameCube&#x27;s built-in clock. This led to the game&#x27;s slogan, &quot;the real life game that&#x27;s playing, even when you&#x27;re not&quot;. &quot;Dōbutsu no Mori+&quot; cost with 92,568 copies sold during its first week in Japan.

When Nintendo began localizing &quot;Dōbutsu no Mori+&quot; for release in North America as &quot;Animal Crossing&quot;, the game underwent an immense translation project, which resulted in much more text than the Japanese version. Not only did thousands of lines of text have to be translated, but translators Nate Bihldorff and Rich Amtower had to create new holidays and items to be relatable outside of Japan. The translation process took six months total, which at the time was Nintendo of America&#x27;s largest translation project to date. It was released in North America on September 16, 2002, in Australia on September 15, 2003, and in the United Kingdom on September 24, 2004. Nintendo&#x27;s Japanese leadership was so impressed with the work done by Nintendo of America&#x27;s Treehouse division that they added the American content back into the Japanese version and released it as along with more new content. It was released in Japan on June 27, 2003, with 91,658 copies sold during its first week.

==Reception==
Upon its release, &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; was subject to critical acclaim. It was named the seventh best game of all time on the GameCube by the television show &quot;X-Play&quot; on the G4 network. On &quot;IGN&quot;, the game holds an &quot;outstanding&quot; 9.1 rating.

Some critics praised the game&#x27;s use of the GameCube&#x27;s internal clock and calendar and its inclusion of hidden NES games. However, others, such as &quot;IGN&quot;″s Peer Schneider, criticized its audio and visuals, for being below-standard quality for a GameCube game. According to the review aggregator site Metacritic, the game received a score of 87 out of 100, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; based on 42 critics. According to GameRankings, the game received a score of 86% based on 72 reviews. The game was a commercial success, at more than 2 million copies sold worldwide. By July 2006, 1.3 million copies had been sold, totaling $43 million in the United States. &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it as the 37th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. It is one of the best-selling Nintendo GameCube games. ScrewAttack rated it the fifth-best GameCube game on its &quot;Farewell to the GameCube, ten GameCube games&quot; list, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s a game that plays even when you&#x27;re not and can last up to 30 years!&quot; The popularity of the series inspired the creation of an animated film based on the game&#x27;s sequel &quot;Animal Crossing: Wild World&quot;, titled &quot;Dōbutsu no Mori&quot;, which was released exclusively in Japan.

===Accolades===
During the 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences awarded &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; with &quot;Outstanding Innovation in Console Gaming&quot;, &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Game Design&quot;, and &quot;Console Role-Playing Game of the Year&quot;; it also received nominations for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Gameplay Engineering&quot;, &quot;Console Game of the Year&quot;, and &quot;Game of the Year&quot;.

&quot;GameSpot&quot; named it the best GameCube game of September 2002, and gave the game its annual &quot;Best Role-Playing Game on GameCube&quot; award. It was a runner-up for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s 2002 &quot;Game of the Year on GameCube&quot; prize, but lost to &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;. The game was ranked 126th in Electronic Gaming Monthly’s “The Greatest 200 Video Games of Their Time” in 2006. In 2021, The Strong National Museum of Play inducted &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; to its World Video Game Hall of Fame.

<doc id="540958" wikidata="Q265118" url="?curid=540958" title="Aquilifer">
<text>An aquilifer (, &quot;eagle-bearer&quot;) was one of the &quot;signiferi&quot; in a Roman legion who carried the eagle standard of the legion. The name derives from the type of standard, &quot;aquila&quot;, meaning &quot;eagle&quot; (which was the universal type used since 106 BC), and &quot;ferre&quot;, the Latin word for bringing or carrying. Before that time, the wolf, boar, bull and horse were also used. The eagle standard was the most important possession of the legion, and its loss was a terrible disgrace.

The &quot;aquila&quot; emblem generally had up-raised wings surrounded by a laurel wreath. It was mounted on a narrow trapezoidal base and mounted on a pole that was held aloft.

The &quot;aquilifer&quot;&#x27;s position was accordingly one of enormous prestige, and he was ranked immediately below the centurions and above the optiones, receiving twice the pay of an ordinary legionary . &quot;Aquilifers&quot; carried a small circular shield called a &quot;parma&quot; that could be strapped on if their hands were already full . &quot;Aquilifers&quot; were very easily recognizable not only because of their standard but because they always wore a type of fur: as wolf fur was worn by the vexillarius and bear fur by the &quot;signifer&quot;, a lion fur was given to the &quot;aquilifers&quot;. The furs were worn as capes with the head of the animal strapped to the helmet of the bearer.

==Examples of &quot;aquilifers&quot; in &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot;==
The idea that great disgrace would fall upon a legion should its eagle fall into enemy hands or the symbolism of its passage being barred by enemies places &quot;aquilifers&quot; in a key position—that of maintaining a legion&#x27;s honor.

An &quot;aquilifer&quot; plays an important role in the landing of Roman soldiers in Britannia, as accounted by Julius Caesar. In &quot;de Bello Gallico&quot; IV. 25, Britons put up stiff resistance against the Roman landing party, therefore the legionaries delay to avoid engaging with the enemy. To spur on the troops, the &quot;aquilifer&quot; shouts out, so that all the soldiers can hear him, that despite the common lack of initiative, he would have fulfilled his office for both Julius Caesar, his general, and for the public (pūblicae) thing (reī) (&quot;i.e.&quot; for the republic); he then immediately jumps from the ship and makes his way to the shore with the eagle so that others may be inspired to follow him. The text reads as such: 

&quot;&#x27;Desilite&#x27;, inquit, &#x27;commilitiones, nisi vultis aquilam hostibus prodere; ego certe meum rei publicae atque imperatori officium praestitero&#x27;. Hoc cum voce magna dixisset, se ex navi proiecit atque in hostes aquilam ferre coepit&quot; (Mueller and Julius Caesar 2013).

Unfortunately for the Romans, chaos ensues as soldiers from different divisions group themselves to the closest standard rather than their assigned one, disturbing battle formation greatly .

===Lucius Petrosidius===

Few &quot;aquilifers&quot; are recorded individually in history. An exception to this is Lucius Petrosidius, who is mentioned by Caesar in &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot;, his first hand account of the Gallic Wars. The Latin text says &quot;Ex quibus Lucius Petrosidius aquilifer, cum magna multitudine hostium premeretur, aquilam intra vallum proiecit; ipse pro castris fortissime pugnans occiditur&quot; , which translates to &quot;From which Lucius Petrosidius, an Eagle-bearer, although hard pressed by a great multitude, threw the eagle behind the wall. He was killed most bravely fighting for the camp&quot; (; ).

<text>Raaj Kumar (born Kulbhushan Pandit; 8 October 1926 3 July 1996) was an Indian actor who worked in Hindi films. He worked as a police officer before entering the film industry. In a career that spanned over four decades, he went on to star in 70 films and is regarded as one of the most successful actors of Indian cinema.

==Personal life==
Kulbhushan Pandit was born on 8 October, 1926 in Loralai in the Baluchistan Province of British India (now in Pakistan) into a Kashmiri Pandit family. In the late 1940s, he moved to Bombay, where he became a sub-inspector under Bombay Police. In the 1960s, he married Jennifer Pandit, an Anglo-Indian, whom he met on a flight where she was an air hostess. She later changed her name to Gayatri Kumar as per Hindu customs. They had three children, sons Puru Raaj Kumar (an actor), Panini Raaj Kumar and daughter Vastavikta Pandit, who made her screen debut in 2006 film &quot;Eight: The Power of Shani&quot;.

==Career==

===1952–1964: Early career and breakthrough===

Raaj Kumar began his career with &quot;Rangeeli&quot; in 1952 and followed it with &quot;Anmol Sahar&quot; (1952), &quot;Aabshar&quot; (1953), &quot;Ghamand&quot; (1955), none of which could establish him. After many years of struggle, he got his breakthrough with Mehboob Khan&#x27;s epic drama film &quot;Mother India&quot; (1957). It opened to critical acclaim and emerged an &quot;All Time Blockbuster&quot; at the box office as well as the most successful film of the 1950s. It went on to win several accolades and was featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. The huge box office success of &quot;Mother India&quot; was followed by another blockbuster in S. S. Vasan&#x27;s social drama film &quot;Paigham&quot; (1959), which had Dilip Kumar and Vyjayanthimala in the lead. Kumar received praise for his performance of a caring elder brother and got a nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor category.

Kumar began the new decade with Kishore Sahu&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Dil Apna Aur Preet Parai&quot;. The film proved to be a box office superhit with one of its song &quot;Ajeeb Dastan Hai Yeh&quot; sung by Lata Mangeshkar becoming a chartbuster. In 1961, he appeared alongside Rajendra Kumar and Asha Parekh in &quot;Gharana&quot;. A remake of Telugu blockbuster &quot;Shanthi Nivasam&quot;, the film proved to be equally successful in Hindi and emerged a superhit at the box office. After an absence lasting a year, he reunited with Rajendra Kumar and Meena Kumari for C. V. Sridhar&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Dil Ek Mandir&quot;. It opened to highly positive response from audience and went on to become a superhit with Kumar receiving Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in the film. His other major release of the year, &quot;Phool Bane Angaare&quot; also did reasonably well at the box office. In 1964, he once again worked with Rajendra Kumar and Vyjayanthimala in Ramanand Sagar&#x27;s second directional venture &quot;Zindagi&quot;. The film opened to positive response and added one more box office hit in his kitty.

===1965–1979: Continued success ===

After many years of doing second leads, Raaj Kumar became a saleable star in 1965 with Yash Chopra&#x27;s ensemble masala film &quot;Waqt&quot; and Ram Maheshwari&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Kaajal&quot;, both of which opened to massive response from audience and went on to become blockbusters. For portraying a sophisticated thief in &quot;Waqt&quot;, Kumar won massive acclaim and his second Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. His performance in &quot;Kaajal&quot; was also appreciated and he received his first and only nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Actor category for the film. Kumar&#x27;s other notable release of the year was Phani Majumdar&#x27;s drama film &quot;Oonche Log&quot; co-starring Ashok Kumar and Feroz Khan. The film received positive reviews from critics and won National Film Award for Second Best Feature Film in Hindi. After having no release in 1966, the following year, he reunited with makers of &quot;Waqt&quot; for the suspense thriller &quot;Hamraaz&quot;. The film proved to be a major critical and commercial success, eventually emerging a blockbuster and winning National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. One of its song, &quot;Neele Gagan Ke Tale&quot;, sung by Mahendra Kapoor and filmed on Kumar and Vimi proved to be an instant hit and won Kapoor his second Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer. He also reunited with C. V. Sridhar (the director of &quot;Dil Ek Mandir&quot;) for the multi-starrer social drama &quot;Nai Roshni&quot;, but contrary to expectations, it did not performed well. He concluded the decade with two biggies - &quot;Mere Huzoor&quot; and &quot;Neel Kamal&quot;. While the former co-starring Jeetendra and Mala Sinha did moderately well, the latter alongside Manoj Kumar and Waheeda Rehman was a superhit and one of the top five highest grossing films of 1968. For portraying a soul longing for his lost love in &quot;Neel Kamal&quot;, Kumar received his fifth and final nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor category.

The early-1970s saw Kumar appearing in some of his most iconic films. His only release of 1970 was Chetan Anand&#x27;s romantic musical &quot;Heer Raanjha&quot; opposite Priya Rajvansh. It opened to highly positive reviews from critics and emerged a box office hit. The soundtrack of &quot;Heer Raanjha&quot; composed by Madan Mohan was a chartbuster with a Mohammed Rafi solo - &quot;Yeh Duniya, Yeh Mehfil Mere Kaam Ki Nahin&quot; becoming a rage among the masses. The success of &quot;Heer Raanjha&quot; was followed by &quot;Lal Patthar&quot; and &quot;Maryada&quot; in 1971. While, &quot;Lal Patthar&quot; in which he got paired with Hema Malini was an average fare, &quot;Maryada&quot; opposite Mala Sinha and co-starring Rajesh Khanna proved to be a superhit. In 1972, Kumar appeared in Kamal Amrohi&#x27;s magnum opus &quot;Pakeezah&quot; which also had Meena Kumari (in her final film appearance) and Ashok Kumar in the lead. Despite receiving polarizing reviews and being a slow starter, it went on to become a massive blockbuster at the box office and gained cult status in later years. Its soundtrack composed by Naushad dominated the musical charts and was the eighth best-selling Hindi film album of the 1970s.

Kumar then appeared in films, &quot;Dil Ka Raja&quot; (1972), &quot;Hindustan Ki Kasam&quot; (1973) and &quot;36 Ghante&quot; (1974), all three of which flopped at the box office. This changed with Brij&#x27;s action comedy film &quot;Ek Se Badhkar Ek&quot; (1976), alongside Ashok Kumar, Navin Nischol and Sharmila Tagore. The film performed very well at the box office and was also remade in Telugu as &quot;Mugguru Muggure&quot;. In 1978, Kumar reunited with Jeetendra and Mala Sinha for Ram Maheshwari&#x27;s action drama film &quot;Karmayogi&quot; in which he played a double role. It opened to positive response from critics and emerged a superhit.

===1980–1995: Career slump, comeback and final works===

Kumar began the 1980s with Ram Maheshwari&#x27;s dacoit drama &quot;Chambal Ki Kasam&quot;, which sank without a trace. In 1981, he had two releases, out of which, Esmayeel Shroff&#x27;s crime thriller &quot;Bulundi&quot; proved to be a moderate fare while Chetan Anand&#x27;s reincarnation drama &quot;Kudrat&quot; alongside Rajesh Khanna, Vinod Khanna, Hema Malini and Priya Rajvansh was a critical and commercial failure. In 1982, he reunited with Rajesh Khanna and Jeetendra for Sultan Ahmed&#x27;s successful actioner &quot;Dharam Kanta&quot;. This was followed by a series of critical and commercial duds in &quot;Ek Nai Paheli&quot; (1984), &quot;Sharara&quot; (1984), &quot;Raaj Tilak&quot; (1984), &quot;Itihaas&quot; (1987), &quot;Muqaddar Ka Faisla&quot; (1987), &quot;Mohabbat Ke Dushman&quot; (1988), &quot;Saazish&quot; (1988), &quot;Mahaveera&quot; (1988) and &quot;Jungbaaz&quot; (1989). During this phase, Kumar remained steady with superhits in Mehul Kumar&#x27;s &quot;Marte Dam Tak&quot; (1987) and Esmayeel Shroff&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1989).

Kumar began the 1990s with another of Esmayeel Shroff&#x27;s film, the crime thriller &quot;Police Public&quot; (1990). An adaptation of &quot;Oru CBI Diary Kurippu&quot; (1988), it performed well commercially and went on to become a box office hit. The following year, he reunited with his &quot;Paigham&quot; co-star Dilip Kumar for Subhash Ghai&#x27;s action drama film &quot;Saudagar&quot;. The film emerged a blockbuster and took 1st spot at the box office in 1991. Its soundtrack composed by Laxmikant–Pyarelal was a chartbuster and the fourth best-selling Hindi film album of that year. In 1993, Kumar starred alongside Nana Patekar in Mehul Kumar&#x27;s magnum opus, the patriotic action drama &quot;Tirangaa&quot; (1993). &quot;Tirangaa&quot; opened to excellent response all over the nation and proved to be another blockbuster for the actor. It was also the final box office success of Kumar as his later films like &quot;Betaaj Badshah&quot; (1994), &quot;Jawab&quot; (1995) and &quot;God and Gun&quot; (1995) (which was his last film role) were critical and commercial failures.

==Death==
Kumar died at the age of 69 on 3 July 1996 from throat cancer. According to his son Puru Raaj Kumar in his interview to Farhana Farook, his father suffered from Hodgkins for which he had undergone chemotherapy. The last two years of his life were bad with the nodes recurring in the lungs and ribs.

<doc id="540979" wikidata="Q242657" url="?curid=540979" title="Magnetic moment">
<text>In electromagnetism, the magnetic moment or magnetic dipole moment is the combination of strength and orientation of a magnet or other object or system that exerts a magnetic field. The magnetic dipole moment of an object determines the magnitude of torque the object experiences in a given magnetic field. When the same magnetic field is applied, objects with larger magnetic moments experience larger torques. The strength (and direction) of this torque depends not only on the magnitude of the magnetic moment but also on its orientation relative to the direction of the magnetic field. Its direction points from the south pole to north pole of the magnet (i.e., inside the magnet).

The magnetic moment also expresses the magnetic force effect of a magnet. The magnetic field of a magnetic dipole is proportional to its magnetic dipole moment. The dipole component of an object&#x27;s magnetic field is symmetric about the direction of its magnetic dipole moment, and decreases as the inverse cube of the distance from the object.

Examples of objects or systems that produce magnetic moments include: permanent magnets; astronomical objects such as many planets, including the Earth, and some moons, stars, etc.; various molecules; elementary particles (e.g. electrons); composites of elementary particles (protons and neutronsas of the nucleus of an atom); and loops of electric current such as exerted by electromagnets.

== Definition, units, and measurement ==

=== Definition ===
The magnetic moment can be defined as a vector (really pseudovector) relating the aligning torque on the object from an externally applied magnetic field to the field vector itself. The relationship is given by:
formula_1
where is the torque acting on the dipole, is the external magnetic field, and is the magnetic moment.

This definition is based on how one could, in principle, measure the magnetic moment of an unknown sample. For a current loop, this definition leads to the magnitude of the magnetic dipole moment equaling the product of the current times the area of the loop. Further, this definition allows the calculation of the expected magnetic moment for any known macroscopic current distribution.

An alternative definition is useful for thermodynamics calculations of the magnetic moment. In this definition, the magnetic dipole moment of a system is the negative gradient of its intrinsic energy, , with respect to external magnetic field:
formula_2

Generically, the intrinsic energy includes the self-field energy of the system plus the energy of the internal workings of the system. For example, for a hydrogen atom in a 2p state in an external field, the self-field energy is negligible, so the internal energy is essentially the eigenenergy of the 2p state, which includes Coulomb potential energy and the kinetic energy of the electron. The interaction-field energy between the internal dipoles and external fields is not part of this internal energy.

=== Units ===
The unit for magnetic moment in International System of Units (SI) base units is A⋅m2, where A is ampere (SI base unit of current) and m is meter (SI base unit of distance). This unit has equivalents in other SI derived units including:

formula_3

where N is newton (SI derived unit of force), T is tesla (SI derived unit of magnetic flux density), and J is joule (SI derived unit of energy). Although torque (N·m) and energy (J) are dimensionally equivalent, torques are never expressed in units of energy.

In the CGS system, there are several different sets of electromagnetism units, of which the main ones are ESU, Gaussian, and EMU. Among these, there are two alternative (non-equivalent) units of magnetic dipole moment:
formula_4
formula_5

where statA is statamperes, cm is centimeters, erg is ergs, and G is gauss. The ratio of these two non-equivalent CGS units (EMU/ESU) is equal to the speed of light in free space, expressed in cm⋅s−1.

All formulae in this article are correct in SI units; they may need to be changed for use in other unit systems. For example, in SI units, a loop of current with current and area has magnetic moment (see below), but in Gaussian units the magnetic moment is .

Other units for measuring the magnetic dipole moment include the Bohr magneton and the nuclear magneton.

=== Measurement ===
The magnetic moments of objects are typically measured with devices called magnetometers, though not all magnetometers measure magnetic moment: Some are configured to measure magnetic field instead. If the magnetic field surrounding an object is known well enough, though, then the magnetic moment can be calculated from that magnetic field.

== Relation to magnetization ==

The magnetic moment is a quantity that describes the magnetic strength of an entire object. Sometimes, though, it is useful or necessary to know how much of the net magnetic moment of the object is produced by a particular portion of that magnet. Therefore, it is useful to define the magnetization field as:
formula_6
where and are the magnetic dipole moment and volume of a sufficiently small portion of the magnet This equation is often represented using derivative notation such that
formula_7
where is the elementary magnetic moment and is the volume element. The net magnetic moment of the magnet therefore is
formula_8
where the triple integral denotes integration over the volume of the magnet. For uniform magnetization (where both the magnitude and the direction of is the same for the entire magnet (such as a straight bar magnet) the last equation simplifies to:
formula_9
where is the volume of the bar magnet.

The magnetization is often not listed as a material parameter for commercially available ferromagnetic materials, though. Instead the parameter that is listed is residual flux density (or remanence), denoted . The formula needed in this case to calculate in (units of A⋅m2) is:
formula_10

where:
* is the residual flux density, expressed in teslas.
* is the volume of the magnet (in m3).
* is the permeability of vacuum ().

== Models ==
The preferred classical explanation of a magnetic moment has changed over time. Before the 1930s, textbooks explained the moment using hypothetical magnetic point charges. Since then, most have defined it in terms of Ampèrian currents. In magnetic materials, the cause of the magnetic moment are the spin and orbital angular momentum states of the electrons, and varies depending on whether atoms in one region are aligned with atoms in another.

=== Magnetic pole model ===

The sources of magnetic moments in materials can be represented by poles in analogy to electrostatics. This is sometimes known as the Gilbert model. In this model, a small magnet is modeled by a pair of &quot;fictitious&quot; magnetic monopoles of equal magnitude but opposite polarity. Each pole is the source of magnetic force which weakens with distance. Since magnetic poles always come in pairs, their forces partially cancel each other because while one pole pulls, the other repels. This cancellation is greatest when the poles are close to each other i.e. when the bar magnet is short. The magnetic force produced by a bar magnet, at a given point in space, therefore depends on two factors: the strength of its poles (&quot;magnetic pole strength&quot;), and the vector formula_11 separating them. The magnetic dipole moment is related to the fictitious poles as
formula_12

It points in the direction from South to North pole. The analogy with electric dipoles should not be taken too far because magnetic dipoles are associated with angular momentum (see Relation to angular momentum). Nevertheless, magnetic poles are very useful for magnetostatic calculations, particularly in applications to ferromagnets. Practitioners using the magnetic pole approach generally represent the magnetic field by the irrotational field , in analogy to the electric field .

=== Ampèrian loop model ===

After Hans Christian Ørsted discovered that electric currents produce a magnetic field and André-Marie Ampère discovered that electric currents attract and repel each other similar to magnets, it was natural to hypothesize that all magnetic fields are due to electric current loops. In this model developed by Ampère, the elementary magnetic dipole that makes up all magnets is a sufficiently small amperian loop of current &quot;I&quot;. The dipole moment of this loop is
formula_13
where is the area of the loop. The direction of the magnetic moment is in a direction normal to the area enclosed by the current consistent with the direction of the current using the right hand rule.

==== Localized current distributions ====

The magnetic dipole moment can be calculated for a localized (does not extend to infinity) current distribution assuming that we know all of the currents involved. Conventionally, the derivation starts from a multipole expansion of the vector potential. This leads to the definition of the magnetic dipole moment as:
formula_14
where is the vector cross product, is the position vector, and is the electric current density and the integral is a volume integral. When the current density in the integral is replaced by a loop of current I in a plane enclosing an area S then the volume integral becomes a line integral and the resulting dipole moment becomes
formula_15
which is how the magnetic dipole moment for an Amperian loop is derived.

Practitioners using the current loop model generally represent the magnetic field by the solenoidal field , analogous to the electrostatic field .

==== Magnetic moment of a solenoid ====

A generalization of the above current loop is a coil, or solenoid. Its moment is the vector sum of the moments of individual turns. If the solenoid has identical turns (single-layer winding) and vector area ,
formula_16

=== Quantum mechanical model ===
When calculating the magnetic moments of materials or molecules on the microscopic level it is often convenient to use a third model for the magnetic moment that exploits the linear relationship between the angular momentum and the magnetic moment of a particle. While this relation is straightforward to develop for macroscopic currents using the amperian loop model (see below), neither the magnetic pole model nor the amperian loop model truly represents what is occurring at the atomic and molecular levels. At that level quantum mechanics must be used. Fortunately, the linear relationship between the magnetic dipole moment of a particle and its angular momentum still holds, although it is different for each particle. Further, care must be used to distinguish between the intrinsic angular momentum (or spin) of the particle and the particle&#x27;s orbital angular momentum. See below for more details.

== Effects of an external magnetic field ==

=== Torque on a moment ===

The torque on an object having a magnetic dipole moment in a uniform magnetic field is:
formula_17

This is valid for the moment due to any localized current distribution provided that the magnetic field is uniform. For non-uniform B the equation is also valid for the torque about the center of the magnetic dipole provided that the magnetic dipole is small enough.

An electron, nucleus, or atom placed in a uniform magnetic field will precess with a frequency known as the Larmor frequency. See Resonance.

=== Force on a moment ===

A magnetic moment in an externally produced magnetic field has a potential energy :
formula_18

In a case when the external magnetic field is non-uniform, there will be a force, proportional to the magnetic field gradient, acting on the magnetic moment itself. There are two expressions for the force acting on a magnetic dipole, depending on whether the model used for the dipole is a current loop or two monopoles (analogous to the electric dipole). The force obtained in the case of a current loop model is
formula_19

Assuming existence of magnetic monopole, the force is modified as follows:
formula_20

In the case of a pair of monopoles being used (i.e. electric dipole model), the force is
formula_21And one can be put in terms of the other via the relation
formula_22

In all these expressions is the dipole and is the magnetic field at its position. Note that if there are no currents or time-varying electrical fields or magnetic charge, , and the two expressions agree.

=== Relation to free energy ===

One can relate the magnetic moment of a system to the free energy of that system. In a uniform magnetic field , the free energy can be related to the magnetic moment of the system as
formula_23
where is the entropy of the system and is the temperature. Therefore, the magnetic moment can also be defined in terms of the free energy of a system as
formula_24

=== Magnetism ===

In addition, an applied magnetic field can change the magnetic moment of the object itself; for example by magnetizing it. This phenomenon is known as magnetism. An applied magnetic field can flip the magnetic dipoles that make up the material causing both paramagnetism and ferromagnetism. Additionally, the magnetic field can affect the currents that create the magnetic fields (such as the atomic orbits) which causes diamagnetism.

== Effects on environment ==

=== Magnetic field of a magnetic moment ===

Any system possessing a net magnetic dipole moment will produce a dipolar magnetic field (described below) in the space surrounding the system. While the net magnetic field produced by the system can also have higher-order multipole components, those will drop off with distance more rapidly, so that only the dipole component will dominate the magnetic field of the system at distances far away from it.

The magnetic field of a magnetic dipole depends on the strength and direction of a magnet&#x27;s magnetic moment formula_25 but drops off as the cube of the distance such that:
&lt;math display=&quot;block&quot;&gt;\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{4\pi} \left(\frac{3\mathbf{r}(\mathbf{m}\cdot\mathbf{r})}

<doc id="540981" wikidata="Q2261249" url="?curid=540981" title="Ralph Records">
<text>Ralph Records was an independent record label active between 1972 and 1989, best known for being initially run by avant-garde art collective, &quot;The Residents&quot;. The name arose from the slang phrase for vomiting, &quot;calling Ralph on the porcelain telephone&quot;.

Ralph was founded in 1972, shortly after the Residents had moved to San Francisco, when they realized that it was the only entity willing to publish their work. They &quot;unincorporated&quot; themselves as the Residents Uninc. and managed the new company under that name. One of the group&#x27;s members could draw, so they gave the company a graphic design wing called Porno Graphics, a.k.a. Pore-Know Graphics, a.k.a. Poor No Graphics, a.k.a. Porneaugraphics, etc., and the whole operation was run out of their new two-story building at 18 Sycamore St. in the Mission District. The band named its studio El Ralpho, spoofing Sun Ra who had named his El Saturn.

Ralph&#x27;s first release was December 1972&#x27;s &quot;Santa Dog&quot; (RR-1272), a two-disc single that was mailed out free to about three hundred people—friends, radio stations, and even Richard Nixon and Frank Zappa were sent copies (though Zappa&#x27;s was returned—he had moved). This was followed by the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Meet the Residents&quot; (RR-0274), which was recorded in 1973 and released in 1974. The band had trouble with distribution and made up 4,000 seven-minute flexi-disks based on the album with which to promote it. The flexi was included in the February 1974 issue of &quot;File&quot;, a Canadian art magazine.

Over the years Ralph moved to other artists besides the Residents. The first was Schwump, a friend from Portland, Oregon, who in 1976 released a single called &quot;Aphids in the Hall&quot; (RRX-0776). The Residents&#x27; best friend and guitarist, Snakefinger, released a single called &quot;The Spot&quot; (RR-7802) in 1978 and went on to release four albums.

Ralph&#x27;s slogan &quot;Buy Or Die!&quot; was used as the title of its semiannual mail order catalogs, as well as its sampler 7-inch EPs. Four of the &quot;Buy or Die!&quot; EPs had cover art by Gary Panter.

In 1976, the Cryptic Corporation took over control of Ralph Records and maintained it until 1985, when it handed it over to sales manager Tom Timony. The Residents left the label in 1987, after which Timony ran it under license and folded it into his label, TEC Tones, until reverting control to Ralph in 1992. Ralph Records has not really operated since 1987. Since 1992, it has operated as EuroRalphAmerica, the Residents&#x27; mail-order company.

In August 2010 Ralph Records announced its closing &quot;due to the general state of the music business and the expanding cost of creating physical products. It&#x27;s been a great ride. Thanks for all your support over the past 11 years&quot;. Notices were sent on Twitter saying that it would sell out its stock of various limited Residents releases and have a sale on all the other items offered online.

<text>Rajkumar Santoshi is an Indian film director, producer and screenwriter of Hindi films. A recipient of several accolades including three National Film Awards and six Filmfare Awards, he made his directorial debut with the action drama &quot;Ghayal&quot; (1990), starring Sunny Deol, Meenakshi Sheshadri and Amrish Puri. The film emerged as a major critical and commercial success, making Santoshi a household name in Hindi cinema. The film also won him the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment as well as his first Filmfare Award for Best Director.

He also directed the crime drama thriller &quot;Damini&quot; (1993), again starring Sheshadri, Deol and Puri. It also emerged as a major critical and commercial success, garnering Santoshi the Filmfare Award for Best Screenplay and his second consecutive Filmfare Award for Best Director. During this period, Santoshi also received praise for directing the comedy &quot;Andaz Apna Apna&quot; (1994) starring Aamir Khan and Salman Khan together, which despite being a box-office flop has attained cult status. He next directed the action romance &quot;Barsaat&quot; (1995), which marked the film debut of Bobby Deol and Twinkle Khanna. His next action drama &quot;&quot; (1996), also emerged as a commercial success. &quot;Andaz Apna Apna&quot; and &quot;Ghatak: Lethal&quot; earned him nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Director.

In 2000, he directed and wrote dialogues of the action thriller &quot;Pukar&quot; which earned him the Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration. He followed it by directing two moderate commercial successes—the biopic &quot;The Legend of Bhagat Singh&quot; (2002) and the action thriller &quot;Khakee&quot; (2004) —both of which earned him nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Director. His highest-grossing film came in 2009 with the romantic comedy &quot;Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani&quot; starring Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif, which grossed worldwide.

== Personal life ==
He is the son of producer-director P. L. Santoshi and his second wife. Rajkumar was born in Chennai (then Madras) and currently lives with his wife Manila and children; Ram and Tanisha.

== Career ==

=== Early work and breakthrough (1982-1990) ===
Santoshi started his career in 1982 as an assistant director on Govind Nihalani on the coming-of-age film &quot;Vijeta&quot; (1982) and the crime drama &quot;Ardh Satya&quot; (1983).

Santoshi made his directorial debut with the action drama &quot;Ghayal&quot; (1990), starring Sunny Deol and Meenakshi Seshadri in lead roles. The film tells the story of a person in search of his missing brother and the events that follow. It emerged as a critical and commercial success, ranking as the second highest-grossing Hindi film of the year. &quot;Ghayal&quot; earned Santoshi his first Filmfare Award for Best Director, the Filmfare Award for Best Story, and the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment.

=== Critical and commercial success (1991-1999) ===
Santoshi followed it up with was the crime drama thriller &quot;Damini&quot; (1993), which dealt with themes considered bold at the time, such as the status of women in our society and the perspective of people towards women. The film starred Seshadri in the lead role, alongside Deol, Rishi Kapoor and Amrish Puri. It opened to universal critical acclaim, with widespread praise for its storyline, execution and themes; moreover, It also emerged as a major commercial success at the box-office, ranking as the fifth highest-grossing Hindi film of the year. &quot;Damini&quot; earned Santoshi his second consecutive Filmfare Award for Best Director, thus becoming the only director to have won the award for his first two films. The film is now considered a cult feminist film and important for portraying women empowerment in cinema. The pathbreaking film was praised for breaking social taboos and handling the subject of rape with sensitivity; a rarity in Bollywood at the time.

After making two back-to-back serious films, Santoshi decided to make a light film. He then wrote and directed the comedy &quot;Andaz Apna Apna&quot; (1994), starring an ensemble cast of Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Raveena Tandon, Karisma Kapoor, Paresh Rawal (in a dual role) and Shakti Kapoor in lead roles. The film received critical acclaim upon release but emerged as a commercial failure at the box-office. It earned Santoshi his third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Director. However over the years, it is considered a cult classic comedy, with its lexicon having become a part of everyday and ordinary language.

Santoshi then went on to make the action romance &quot;Barsaat&quot; (1995), which marked the debut of actors Bobby Deol and Twinkle Khanna. The film received mixed reviews from critics upon release, but emerged as a commercial success at the box-office, ranking as the fourth highest-grossing Hindi film of the year.

The following year, Santoshi wrote and directed the action drama &quot;&quot; (1996), marking his third collaboration with Deol and Sheshadri. The film received positive reviews from critics upon release, and emerged as a major commercial success at the box-office, ranking as the fourth highest-grossing Hindi film of the year. It earned Santoshi the Filmfare Award for Best Screenplay, in addition to his fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Director.

His next venture was the action film &quot;China Gate&quot; (1998), inspired from Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s epic drama &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (1954). It follows the story of a village that hire a group of veterans to combat bandits who terrorise them. The film received mixed-to-negative reviews from critics upon release, with criticism for its story, screenplay and execution, and emerged as an average commercial success at the box-office, ranking as the tenth highest-grossing Hindi film of the year. However, it won Santoshi the Filmfare Award for Best Dialogue.

=== Established filmmaker (2000-2005) ===
Santoshi began the new millennium with writing and directing the action thriller &quot;Pukar&quot; (2000) starring Anil Kapoor and Madhuri Dixit in lead roles. The film tells the story of a notorious terrorist who manipulates an Indian army major&#x27;s jilted lover into helping him obtain a classified military code. The film received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics upon release, but emerged as an average grosser at the box-office. It won Santoshi the Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration.

He followed it up with the social drama &quot;Lajja&quot; (2001), which told the story of four Indian women belonging to different strata of society. The film dealt with issues like gender inequality and the status of women in our society. The film starred an ensemble cast of Rekha, Manisha Koirala, Dixit, Mahima Chaudhary, Anil Kapoor, Ajay Devgn and Jackie Shroff in lead roles. &quot;Lajja&quot; opened to mixed reviews from critics upon release, with criticism for Santoshi&#x27;s story and screenplay. It emerged as a commercial failure at the Indian box-office, but was successful in overseas markets.

His next venture was &quot;The Legend of Bhagat Singh&quot; (2002), a biopic on the freedom fighter Bhagat Singh, portrayed by Devgn. The film opened to positive reviews upon release, with praise for its direction, story and screenplay. It released alongside another film based on Bhagat, &quot;23 March 1931: Shaheed&quot;, which featured Bobby Deol as the revolutionary. Despite hype prior to release, the film emerged as a commercial failure at the box-office. The film&#x27;s failure was attributed to its release on the same day as &quot;23rd March 1931: Shaheed&quot;, with &quot;the two Bhagats eating into each other&#x27;s business&quot;. It, however, won Santoshi the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. Since its release, &quot;The Legend of Bhagat Singh&quot; has been considered one of Santoshi&#x27;s best works. In 2016, the film was included in &quot;Hindustan Times&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;Bollywood&#x27;s Top 5 Biopics&quot;.

Santoshi wrote and directed the ensemble neo-noir crime thriller &quot;Khakee&quot; (2004), starring Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Devgn, Aishwarya Rai and Tusshar Kapoor in lead roles. The film told the story of a group of cops who get embroiled in a mystery surrounding a terrorist attack. It opened to high critical acclaim upon release, with Derek Elley of &quot;Variety&quot; writing: &quot;Powerhouse casting, and equally powerhouse direction by Rajkumar Santoshi, makes this an above-average example of mainstream Bollywood thrillers.&quot; The film emerged as a major commercial success at the box-office, ranking as the fifth highest-grossing Hindi film of the year. &quot;Khakee&quot;&#x27;s success reiterated Santoshi as one of Bollywood&#x27;s most sought-after directors, and earned him his fifth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Director.

=== Setbacks and resurgence (2006-2009) ===
His next venture was the action thriller family drama &quot;Family – Ties of Blood&quot; (2006) starring Bachchan, Kumar and Bhumika Chawla in lead roles. The film opened to negative reviews from critics upon release, and emerged as a commercial disaster at the box-office.

He next wrote and directed the social action drama &quot;Halla Bol&quot; (2008) starring Devgn, Vidya Balan and Pankaj Kapur in lead roles. The film was based on the life of activist Safdar Hashmi, who was killed by political rivals while performing in a street play (by the name of &quot;Halla Bol&quot;) in 1989. It was shot in 75 days in over 65 locations. &quot;Halla Bol&quot; was panned by critics, with Khalid Mohamed calling it &quot;downright awful&quot; [..] &quot;packed with mind-benders galore.&quot; The film emerged as his second consecutive commercial disaster at the box-office.

Santoshi&#x27;s career prospects improved when he wrote and directed the romantic comedy &quot;Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani&quot; (2009) starring Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif in lead roles. The film opened to positive reviews from critics upon release, with particular praise for its direction, story, screenplay, dialogues. It emerged as a major commercial success at the box-office, grossing ₹103.21 crore (US$12.4 million) worldwide, ranking as the third highest-grossing Hindi film of the year, and is currently the highest-grossing film of Santoshi&#x27;s career.

=== Intermittent work (2010-present) ===
After a 4-year hiatus, Santoshi made a comeback with the action comedy &quot;Phata Poster Nikhla Hero&quot; (2013) starring Shahid Kapoor and Ileana D&#x27;Cruz in lead roles. The film received mixed reviews from critics upon release and emerged as a commercial failure at the box-office.

After a 10-year hiatus, Santoshi made a comeback with three diverse ventures – the historical &quot;Gandhi Godse – Ek Yudh&quot;, the social comedy-drama &quot;Aalay Mazya Rashila&quot; and the romantic comedy &quot;Bad Boy&quot;. All the three films opened to mixed-to-negative reviews upon release, and emerged as commercial disasters at the box-office.

<text>Thomas J. Peters (born November 7, 1942) is an American writer on business management practices, best known for &quot;In Search of Excellence&quot; (co-authored with Robert H. Waterman Jr.)

==Life and education==
Peters was born in Baltimore, Maryland. He went to Severn School, a private, preparatory high school, graduating in 1960. Peters then attended Cornell University, receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree in civil engineering in 1964, and a master&#x27;s degree in 1966.

He returned to academia in 1970 to study business at Stanford Business School receiving an MBA followed by a PhD in Organizational Behavior in 1977. The title of his dissertation was &quot;Patterns of Winning and Losing: Effects on Approach and Avoidance by Friends and Enemies.&quot; Karl Weick credited Peters&#x27; dissertation with giving him the idea for his 1984 article: &quot;Small wins: Redefining the scale of social problems.&quot;
While at Stanford, Peters was influenced by Jim G. March, Herbert Simon (both at Stanford), and Karl Weick (at the University of Michigan). Later, he noted that he was influenced by Douglas McGregor and Einar Thorsrud.

In 2004, he also received an honorary doctorate from the State University of Management in Moscow.

==Career==
From 1966 to 1970, Peters served in the U.S. Navy, making two deployments to Vietnam as a Navy Seabee, then later working for the Pentagon. From 1973 to 1974, he worked in the White House as a senior drug-abuse advisor, during the Nixon administration. Peters acknowledged both the influence of military strategist Colonel John Boyd and OODA loops in his later writing.

From 1974 to 1981, Peters worked as a management consultant at McKinsey &amp; Company, becoming a partner and Organization Effectiveness practice leader in 1979. In 1981, he left McKinsey to become an independent consultant.

In 1990, Peters was referred to in a British Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) publication as one of the world&#x27;s &quot;Quality Gurus&quot;.

In 1995, the &quot;New York Times&quot; referred to Peters as one of the top three business experts in the highest demand as a speaker along with Daniel Burrus and Roger Blackwell.

By 2000, Peters was noted for his ever-increasingly aggressive and sometimes &quot;crackpot&quot; demeanor while at the same time his target audiences had changed towards the considerably lower ranks of SMI management.
In 2017, &quot;Thinkers50&quot; awarded Peters with its Lifetime Achievement Award for his paving the way for the &quot;thought leadership&quot; and business book industries.

===&quot;In Search of Excellence&quot;===
The publication of the popular business book &quot;In Search of Excellence&quot; in 1982 marked a turning point in Peters&#x27; career.

Peters states that directly after graduating with a PhD from Stanford in 1977, and returning to McKinsey, the new managing director, Ron Daniel, handed him a &quot;fascinating assignment&quot;. Motivated by the new ideas coming from Bruce Henderson&#x27;s Boston Consulting Group, Daniel noted that businesses often failed to effectively implement new strategies, so Peters &quot;was asked to look at &#x27;organization effectiveness&#x27; and &#x27;implementation issues&#x27; in an inconsequential offshoot project nested in McKinsey&#x27;s rather offbeat San Francisco office&quot;.

&quot;In Search of Excellence&quot; became a bestseller, gaining exposure in the United States at a national level when a series of television specials based on the book and hosted by Peters appeared on PBS. The primary ideas espoused solving business problems with as little business-process overhead as possible, and empowering decision-makers at multiple levels of a company.

The December 2001 issue of &quot;Fast Company&quot; quoted Peters admitting that he and Waterman had falsified the underlying data for &quot;In Search of Excellence&quot;. He is quoted as saying, &quot;This is pretty small beer, but for what it&#x27;s worth, okay, I confess: We faked the data. A lot of people suggested it at the time.&quot; He later insisted that this was untrue and that he was the victim of an &quot;aggressive headline&quot;.

===Later work===
In 1987 Peters published &quot;Thriving on Chaos: Handbook for a Management Revolution&quot;.

In later books, Peters has encouraged personal responsibility in response to the &quot;New Economy.&quot;

More recent books are The Excellence Dividend, released in April 2018, and Excellence Now: Extreme Humanism, released in 2021.

Peters currently lives in South Dartmouth, MA with his wife Susan Sargent, and continues to write and speak about personal and business empowerment and problem-solving methodologies.

His namesake company &quot;Tom Peters Company&quot; is based in Essex, UK.

<text>The Anacostia Community Museum (known colloquially as the ACM) is a community museum in the Anacostia neighborhood of Washington, D.C., in the United States. It is one of twenty museums under the umbrella of the Smithsonian Institution and was the first federally funded community museum in the United States. The museum, founded in 1967, was created with the intention to bring aspects of the Smithsonian museums, located on the National Mall, to the Anacostia neighborhood, with the hope that community members from the neighborhood would visit the main Smithsonian museums. It became federally funded in 1970 and focuses on the community in and around Anacostia in its exhibitions. This museum also houses a library.

==History==

===Origins===
The Anacostia Community Museum was originally described as &quot;an experimental store-front museum&quot; by the Smithsonian Institution in 1966. Smithsonian Secretary S. Dillon Ripley intended for the museum to serve as an outreach opportunity to bring more African Americans to the National Mall to visit Smithsonian museums. The idea, which rose from a Smithsonian-hosted conference in 1966, came into reality in March 1967, when the Smithsonian acquired the Carver Theater in the Anacostia neighborhood. The Smithsonian sought community support, and a council of local Anacostia residents came together to advise on the project. John Kinard was appointed director of the museum in June 1967. A pastor and activist during the Civil Rights Movement, Kinard was heavily involved in the Anacostia neighborhood, and he made sure that the young people of the neighborhood were involved in the creation of the museum. Every week, the museum&#x27;s Neighborhood Advisory Committee of community members would meet to help plan the programming and exhibitions. Staff and community members worked side by side to change the building from a defunct movie theater into an exhibition space. The community also assisted in choosing what objects would be displayed.

The Anacostia Neighborhood Museum opened on September 15, 1967. The museum had eight staff members, and only one was permanent. There were no curators or researchers or librarians. A life-size fiberglass model of a &quot;Tricerotops&quot;, which in 1968 would appear as &quot;Uncle Beazley&quot; in the children&#x27;s television movie, &quot;The Enormous Egg&quot;, and which is now near Lemur Island in the National Zoological Park (the National Zoo), attended the museum&#x27;s opening.

In 1968, the museum hired a staff photographer and a photography lab was opened on site. The museum would not become part of the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s federal budget until 1970. That year, the Anacostia Research Center was founded, with funding from the Carnegie Corporation, to create an oral history program. The museum hired its first historian, Louise Daniel Hutchinson, in 1971. By 1972, the museum had ten full-time, permanent staff members, working within three departments: director&#x27;s office, education, and a research and exhibitions department. The museum found it challenging to incorporate the community into its planning processes as it grew larger, and more developed processes formed to incorporate the community into exhibits. The Neighborhood Advisory Committee, which consisted of ninety people, was cut down in size and renamed the Board of Directors.

The Exhibits Design and Production Laboratory, located at Fort Stanton (Washington, D.C.), was opened in October 1974. It was there where preparations for a new museum building took place. In 1976, it suffered a fire after masonite sheets fell from a forklift, and into a container of lacquer thinner. Staff were unable to call for help due to the fire damaging the phone lines. The damage cost approximately $75,000 and no one was injured. The museum became the first Smithsonian museum to use labels for the hearing impaired in their exhibitions, in 1980. An archives devoted to the area of Anacostia was created in 1977.

The new Anacostia Museum was opened on May 17, 1987, located at Fort Stanton. The name change stemmed from the change in the museum&#x27;s mission, to celebrate African American history not only in Anacostia, but around the world. Long-time director John Kinard died in 1989.

===After John Kinard===
Steven Newsome, a professional librarian, became the new museum director in 1991, the same year the museum established its own library. The museum went through another name change, in 1995, becoming the Anacostia Museum and Center for African American History and Culture. Its intent was to serve as the location for the National Museum of African American History and Culture. During Newsome&#x27;s tenure the museum underwent an $8.5 million renovation. In 2004 Newsome retired, with James Early becoming acting director. Once more, the museum decided to change its mission, to focus specifically on Anacostia communities, and changed its name to the Anacostia Community Museum in 2006. That year, Camille Akeju became the director.

With the arrival of Akeju, the museum&#x27;s exhibition process changed, removing the community-driven exhibition process, which allowed community members to submit proposals for exhibitions. The process is now curator-focused, with exhibition concepts being chosen by staff.

==Architecture==
The Fort Stanton building, which opened in 1987, was designed by Keyes Condon Florance, Architrave and Wisnewski Blair Associates. The design, based on the &quot;cultural expressionism style&quot;, aimed to make use of the natural setting it resides in. The building exterior is made of red brick motifs reflecting kente cloth. Cylinders made of concrete with glass blocks and blue tile sit in the facade of the building. The cylinders pull influence from the ruins of Great Zimbabwe. Large picture windows reside at the entrance.

In March 2019 the museum closed for a $4.5 million renovation. It reopened in October 2019.

==Collections==
ACM did not have a permanent collection until the late 1970s. The museum was not allowed to build such a collection by the Smithsonian. The Smithsonian lacked objects in its collections related to African American history and culture, and John Kinard helped encourage other museums to start acquiring such items, such as artwork and pieces owned by Duke Ellington. In 1977 the museum was able to start building its permanent collection. The museum library was established in 1991. It wasn&#x27;t until 1992 that ACM created its first collections management policy, specifying a focus on the Anacostia neighborhood and surrounding areas. The museum was donated the archives of Lorenzo Dow Turner, in 2003, by his wife, Lois Turner Williams. In 2010, an exhibition &quot;Word, Shout, Song: Lorenzo Dow Turner, Connecting Communities Through Language,&quot; was held to showcase the collection. The museum also has a collection of art including work by artists such as James A. Porter, Sam Gilliam, and Benny Andrews.

==Exhibitions==

Throughout its history, the museum&#x27;s exhibitions have reflected the community of Anacostia, Washington, D.C., and often concerns seen throughout urban communities in the United States. African American history and art has also been showcased in exhibitions, including subjects such as immigration, slavery, civil rights, and music. The opening exhibition at the museum, in 1967, featured the reproduction of an Anacostia store front from 1890, a Project Mercury spacecraft, a theater, a small zoo, and a varied collection of natural history objects. The small zoo featured a parrot, named George, which was a gift from the National Zoo. George died in April, 1977. Other early exhibitions at the museum, when it was still called the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum, included 1969&#x27;s &quot;The Rat: Man&#x27;s Invited Affliction,&quot; which examined rat infestations. The museum&#x27;s bicentennial exhibition, &quot;Blacks in the Western Movement,&quot; focused on the stories of African Americans who explored and settled the American west. The exhibition traveled nationwide and was made into a documentary film. These early exhibitions, which often consisted of panel displays, were called &quot;pasteboard exhibits,&quot; by director John Kinard. Community members in the early years frequently helped put together the exhibitions, along with staff such as exhibit designer James E. Mayo.

ACM started working with the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES) to create traveling exhibitions, which were the first major African American themed exhibitions at the Smithsonian. In 1977 the exhibition &quot;The Anacostia Story&quot; exhibited the history of the neighborhood from 1608 to 1930. Frederick Douglass, who lived in Anacostia, was the focus of &quot;The Frederick Douglass Years.&quot; The 1979 exhibition &quot;Out of Africa: From West African Kingdoms to Colonization&quot; was the first to make use of the museum&#x27;s budding permanent collection, and Chancellor Williams lectured. The museum closed for little over two months in, from November until January, 1980, re-opening with the exhibition &quot;Anna J. Cooper: A Voice from the South.&quot; To celebrate the centennial of the birth of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Smithsonian organized an institution wide series of events, with ACN organizing &quot;Mary McLeod Bethune and Roosevelt&#x27;s Black Cabinet.&quot; Mercer Ellington, the son of Duke Ellington, filmed a public service announcement for the exhibition &quot;The Renaissance: Black Arts of the &#x27;20s&quot;. ACM focused on Washington, D.C.&#x27;s role in equal and civil rights in &quot;To Achieve These Rights: The Struggle for Equal Rights and Self-Determination in the District of Columbia, 1791-1978.&quot; The Washington region was a focus again with &quot;Footsteps from North Brentwood,&quot; which discussed the history of Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland.

In 2006, the ACM exhibition &quot;Reclaiming Midwives: Pillars of Community Support,&quot; discussed the roles of midwives in African American communities. ACM partnered with the Mexican Cultural Institute to produce &quot;The African Presence in Mexico.&quot; The 2010 exhibition &quot;Word, Shout and Song&quot; examined the work of Lorenzo Dow Turner and the Gullah language.

==Education==
The museum began offering accredited education courses with teachers in 1977. The Museum Education Department also publishes history publications about African American history. In 1987 the ACM created the Museum Academy Program. The program focuses on working with local children throughout the year.

<doc id="540991" wikidata="Q783101" url="?curid=540991" title="Golden Jubilee Diamond">
<text>The Golden Jubilee Diamond, a 545.67 carat (109.13 g) brown diamond, is the largest cut and faceted diamond in the world. It outweighs the Cullinan I by 15.37 carats (3.07 g). The Golden Jubilee Diamond was discovered in 1985 at the Premier Mine, which is also the origin of the Cullinan diamond (1905) and other notables such as the Taylor–Burton (1966) and the Centenary (1986). Cullinan I, also known as the Great Star of Africa, had held the title of the largest cut and faceted diamond since 1908.

== History ==
First known as the &quot;Unnamed Brown&quot;, the Golden Jubilee Diamond was cut from a large brown diamond of 755.5 carats (151 g), found in the prolific blue ground of the Premier Mine in South Africa in 1985.

Until 1990, the diamond remained largely unknown to the outside world, requiring two years&#x27; work to bring it to its current state. A large surface and deep cracks from the interior, as well as several inclusions, meant that cutting and polishing the large diamond presented challenges. De Beers considered this as an opportunity to test new cutting technologies. The same technology used in cutting the future Golden Jubilee diamond was later used in the cutting of the Centenary Diamond, a smaller (273.85 carats) flawless and colorless rough diamond.

Gabriel Tolkowsky was hired by De Beers to cut the diamond and also so he could test special tools and cutting methods that were being developed for use on the colourless D-colour Centenary.

Because of its cracks and inclusions, it was decided by De Beers and Gabriel Tolkowsky to construct an underground room that was free from vibration before work could begin on the diamond. In 1990, after two years of work, the stone was finished, reduced in total from 755.50 carats, to 545.65 carats. Gabi Tolkowsky described the cut as a &quot;Fire-Rose cushion shape&quot;.

The unnamed diamond was brought to Thailand by the Thai Diamond Manufacturers Association to be exhibited in the Thai Board of Investment Exhibition in Laem Chabang and was selected to herald De Beer&#x27;s centennial celebrations in 1988.

The Golden Jubilee was purchased from De Beers by a group of Thai business people led by Henry Ho in 1995.

It was arranged for the diamond to be given to King Bhumibol as a gift from the people to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the King&#x27;s ascent to the throne. The diamond was named the Golden Jubilee, and was received by the King&#x27;s daughter, Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, on his behalf in 2000.

The diamond is now on display in the Royal Museum at Pimammek Golden Temple Throne Hall in Bangkok as part of the crown jewels.

== Blessings ==
The diamond was brought to Pope John Paul II in the Vatican to receive a papal blessing. It was also blessed by the Buddhist Supreme Patriarch of Thailand.

The diamond () was named by King Bhumibol Adulyadej and given to him in honour of his 50th coronation anniversary. It was initially planned to mount the Golden Jubilee in the royal sceptre. A subsequent plan was to mount it in a royal seal.

== Exhibitions ==
The Golden Jubilee Diamond has been exhibited at Henry Ho&#x27;s 59-story Jewelry Trade Center in Bangkok, the Central Department Store in Lat Phrao (Bangkok), and internationally in Basel (Switzerland), Borsheims in Omaha, Nebraska, USA (owned by Warren Buffett&#x27;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.), and Gleims Jewelers in Palo Alto, California. USA. It is now located in the Grand Palace as part of the Royal regalia.

== Value ==
The value of the Golden Jubilee diamond is believed to range between $4 and $12 million USD. If sold at auction, it is likely that this stone would fetch a significantly higher price, such additional value gained from affiliation with prominent individuals (Thailand royalty).

<text>The 32X is an add-on for the Sega Genesis video game console. Codenamed &quot;Project Mars&quot;, the 32X was designed to expand the power of the Genesis and serve as a holdover until the release of the Sega Saturn. Independent of the Genesis, the 32X used its own ROM cartridges and had its own library of games, as well as two 32-bit central processing unit chips and a 3D graphics processor. Despite these changes, the console failed to attract either developers or consumers as the Sega Saturn had already been announced for release the next year. In part because of this, and also to rush the 32X to market before the holiday season in 1994, the 32X suffered from a poor library of titles, including Genesis ports with minor improvements such as the number of colors that appeared on screen. Originally released at US$159, Sega dropped the price to $99 in only a few months and ultimately cleared the remaining inventory at $19.95. 800,000 units were sold worldwide.

There were  games produced worldwide, including six that required both the 32X and the Sega CD add-ons, and ten that were only released in North America, as well as only one released exclusively for Brazil. Games that were announced or reported to be in development for the 32X, but never released, are listed at the list of cancelled 32X games.

<text>Reginald Howard White (December 19, 1961 – December 26, 2004) was an American professional football defensive end who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 15 seasons. White played college football for the Tennessee Volunteers, earning unanimous All-American honors. After playing two seasons for the Memphis Showboats of the United States Football League (USFL), he was selected in the first round of the 1984 NFL Supplemental Draft, and then played for the Philadelphia Eagles, the Green Bay Packers and the Carolina Panthers, becoming one of the most awarded defensive players in NFL history. 

The two-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year, Super Bowl XXXI champion, 13-time Pro Bowl, and 13-time All-Pro selection holds second place all-time among NFL career sack leaders with 198. He was selected to the NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team, NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team, NFL 1990s All-Decade Team, and the NFL 1980s All-Decade Team. During his professional career, White is credited with pioneering free agency in sports. Outside of football he was also known for his Christian ministry as an ordained evangelical minister, leading to his nickname, &quot;the Minister of Defense&quot;. White is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame and the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
White was born into a family of unmarried parents, and they lived together in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He was raised by his mother until age eight when he was placed with his grandmother, Mildred Dodd. He played high school football at Howard High School under Coach Robert Pulliam, a former defensive lineman at Tennessee. During his senior year with the Hustlin&#x27; Tigers, White recorded 140 tackles (88 solo) and 10 sacks, and received All-American honors. He was rated the number one recruit in Tennessee by the &quot;Knoxville News Sentinel&quot;.

Reggie&#x27;s mother, Thelma Collier, told &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; that when he was 12 years old he announced to his family that he wanted to be two things: a football player and a minister.

==College career==
White played college football at Tennessee from 1980 to 1983. He had worked hard into the starting lineup by the end of his freshman year, in which he registered 51 tackles (32 solo) and two sacks, recovered two fumbles, and blocked a punt that set up Tennessee&#x27;s first score in the team&#x27;s 23–10 win over then-rival Georgia Tech. He was awarded the Andy Spiva Award, given annually to the Vols&#x27; most improved defensive player.

As a sophomore during the 1981 season, White registered 95 tackles (61 solo), a team-leading eight sacks, and a team-leading seven tackles-for-loss (of yards). He also blocked three extra-point attempts. He had 10 tackles and two sacks, one of which resulted in a safety, against Memphis State, and was named the team&#x27;s &quot;outstanding defensive player&quot; for the game. For his performance in Tennessee&#x27;s 10–7 win over Georgia Tech, which included a late fumble-recovery that sealed the Vols&#x27; victory, he was pronounced &quot;Southeast Lineman of the Week&quot; by UPI. White had eight tackles in Tennessee&#x27;s 28–21 victory over Wisconsin in the 1981 Garden State Bowl, and was named the game&#x27;s &quot;Best Defensive Player&quot;. At the end of the 1981 season, he was named to the Sophomore All-American team by &quot;The Football News&quot;.

White was named a Preseason All-American going into the 1982 season, but was consistently bothered by an ankle injury, and his production dropped off. While he registered only 47 tackles (36 solo), he nevertheless led the team with seven sacks, and was third only to teammates Mike Cofer and Carlton Peoples in &quot;big plays&quot;. His best game of the season came in the Vols&#x27; 24–24 tie against LSU, in which he registered eight tackles, including a sack and a fourth-down stop. He had eight tackles, two sacks, and a forced fumble in Tennessee&#x27;s 28–22 loss to Iowa in the 1982 Peach Bowl.

Determined to improve upon what he considered a disappointing junior campaign, White erupted during his senior season in 1983, registering 100 tackles (72 solo), a school single-season record 15 sacks, 9 tackles-for-loss, and an interception. Although Pittsburgh defeated Tennessee 13–3 in the season opener, White consistently kept the Panthers&#x27; offense off balance, in spite of being lined up against the Panthers&#x27; All-American offensive lineman Bill Fralic. Reggie had two sacks in Tennessee&#x27;s 31–6 win over New Mexico, and a school single-game record four sacks in the Vols&#x27; blowout win over The Citadel. White was named &quot;Southeast Lineman of the Week&quot; for his performance – which included 12 tackles and three sacks – in Tennessee&#x27;s 20–6 win over LSU, and he twice sacked Alabama quarterback Walter Lewis in Tennessee&#x27;s 41–34 win over the Tide. In Tennessee&#x27;s 30–23 win over Maryland in the 1983 Florida Citrus Bowl, White sacked heralded Maryland quarterback Boomer Esiason in the second quarter, knocking him out of the game. White was a consensus All-American, SEC Player of the Year, and a Lombardi Award finalist.

During his tenure at the University of Tennessee, White registered 293 tackles (201 solo), 32 sacks, 19 tackles-for-loss, four fumble recoveries, and seven batted-down passes. His 15 sacks in a season (in 1983) remain a school record. His mark of 32 career sacks remained a school record until it was broken by Derek Barnett in 2016. His school single-game record of four sacks (against The Citadel in 1983) stood until 2013, when Corey Miller had four and a half sacks against Kentucky.

==Professional career==
===Memphis Showboats===
After his college football career, White was chosen by the Memphis Showboats in the 1984 USFL Territorial Draft, and the opportunity to play pro football in the same state where he went to college was enough enticement for him to sign. He played for Memphis for 2 seasons, starting in 36 games. As a member of the Showboats, he racked up 23.5 sacks, one safety and one forced fumble recovered for a touchdown.

===Philadelphia Eagles===
When the USFL collapsed in 1985, White took a salary cut in Philadelphia. The Eagles signed him to a 4-year/$6 million contract (with a $400,000 signing bonus) after buying out the remaining three years on his Memphis contract. White was still considered an unproven entity, but his anonymity did not last long. He joined the Eagles after the 1985 season had begun, missing the first few games. When he finally did start, he made ten tackles and two-and-a-half sacks in his first game. By season&#x27;s end he had turned in 13 sacks in as many games, and he was named NFC Defensive Rookie of the Year.

He played with the Eagles for eight seasons, he played in 121 games and picked up 124 sacks, becoming the Eagles&#x27; all-time sack leader. He also set the Eagles&#x27; regular-season record with 21 sacks in a single season (1987, a season shortened to 12 games). The lowest number of sacks he ever recorded in Philadelphia was 11 in 1989. White also became the only player ever to accumulate 20 or more sacks in just 12 games. He set an NFL regular-season record during 1987 by averaging the most sacks per game, with 1.75. Over the course of his tenure with the Eagles, White actually accumulated more sacks than the number of games he played. In 2008, he was voted by &quot;ESPN Sportsnation&quot; as the greatest player in Eagles&#x27; franchise history. In 1991, he set the record for most passes defended in a single season by a defensive lineman with 13, a record that has been since broken by J. J. Watt.

===Green Bay Packers===
In 1993, White became a free agent. His transaction started a new era in the NFL of player-requested free agency. He was signed by the Green Bay Packers and agreed to a 4-year/$17 million. At the time, he was the 3rd highest paid player in the NFL, trailing only John Elway and Dan Marino. Playing for the Packers for six seasons, White picked up another 68.5 sacks to become, at the time, the Packers&#x27; all-time leader in that category (third now to Clay Matthews III and Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila). White was also just as valued for his role as a team leader. He helped the Packers win Super Bowl XXXI. During the game, White had three sacks to set the single game record for a Super Bowl, including a game-winning sack. That victory was his only championship at any level. In 1998, White was named the NFL Defensive Player of the Year for the second time in his career.

===Carolina Panthers===
In 2000, White came out of a one-year retirement and started all 16 games for the Carolina Panthers. This was his least performing season, as he had five and a half sacks and one forced fumble while with the team. He again retired at the end of the 2000 season.
==NFL career statistics==


==Retirement==
At the time of his retirement, White was the NFL&#x27;s all-time sacks leader with 198. (He has since been surpassed by Bruce Smith, who accumulated 200 in 47 more games played.) Counting his time in the USFL, White has 221.5 sacks in professional football, making him professional football&#x27;s all-time sacks leader. White also recorded three interceptions, which he returned for 79 yards. He recovered 20 fumbles, which he returned for 137 yards and three touchdowns. His nine consecutive seasons (1985–1993) with at least 10 sacks remain an NFL record. He was named an All-Pro for 13 of his 15 seasons, including eight as a first-team selection. Reggie White is considered by many to be one of the best defensive players in NFL history.

==Professional wrestling==
White appeared on screen at two professional wrestling events, wrestling one match. In April 1995, he was ringside as part of Lawrence Taylor&#x27;s &quot;All-Stars&quot; for his match against Bam Bam Bigelow at WrestleMania XI. During the show, he participated in one backstage segment with the All-Stars, calling out The Million Dollar Corporation member King Kong Bundy. Before and during the actual match, the All-Stars and the Million Dollar Corporation were involved in a scuffle, in which White participated.

On May 18, 1997, White wrestled his only professional wrestling match for WCW at Slamboree. He wrestled fellow NFL (and LT&#x27;s All-Star teammate) alumnus Steve McMichael. The two men emulated football tackles during their bout. White received a warm response from the professional wrestling crowd in Charlotte, North Carolina, but nonetheless lost to McMichael after being hit with a steel Zero Halliburton briefcase secretly given to McMichael by his Four Horsemen teammate, Jeff Jarrett.

==Christian ministry and controversies==
White himself was a strong Christian and was open about his faith. He became involved with the Fellowship of Christian Athletes while at the University of Tennessee, and expressed an interest in becoming an evangelist as early as his sophomore year in 1981. He became an ordained Baptist minister during this period. He had acquired the nickname &quot;Minister of Defense&quot; by the time he was a senior.

In White&#x27;s last year of football, a friend reportedly gave White a teaching CD from Messianic teacher Monte Judah. Following his retirement, White began studying the Torah (first five books of the Bible) and Torah-observant Messianic theology. White also studied Hebrew under Nehemia Gordon. In October 2003, White was interviewed by Messianic teacher and televangelist Michael Rood, and he discussed his studies of Torah. The interview was broadcast on February 4 and 6, 2005, on the Sky Angel cable channel. White went on to co-produce Rood&#x27;s half-hour &quot;A Rood Awakening From Israel&quot; TV programs. Following White&#x27;s death, the January 2005 edition of Messianic magazine &quot;Yavoh&quot; was dedicated to him as a &quot;Messianic believer&quot;, leading to confusion regarding White&#x27;s religious beliefs. Some reported – incorrectly – that White had abandoned Christianity and was studying Judaism.

White was touched by the African American church arson scares during the mid-1990s. The Inner City Church in Knoxville, Tennessee, where White was an associate minister, was burned to the ground in 1996. More than $912,000 was collected to rebuild it, including $250,000 in small donations from Wisconsin fans, but the structure was never rebuilt and the congregation was dissolved. No explanation or accounting was ever offered and his reputation suffered. (&quot;Where Did The Money Go?&quot; The Green Bay News-Chronicle, December 8, 2000). 

Also in 1996 he starred with Pat Morita in &quot;Reggie&#x27;s Prayer&quot;, a Christian film. He played protagonist Reggie Knox, a football player who retires after the 1996 season to become a 10th grade history teacher and head coach of a high school football team in Portland, Oregon. The film also had appearances by his Packers teammates Brett Favre and Mike Holmgren as janitors, and Keith Jackson as an assistant coach. M.C. Hammer plays a park ranger.

In an interview with ABC&#x27;s &quot;20/20&quot;, White made comments about Gays and Lesbians. White became an ally of organizations opposed to homosexuality; he appeared in a newspaper advertising campaign to convince gays and lesbians that they could &quot;cease,&quot; or end, their homosexuality. As a result, CBS withdrew a 5-year, $6-million contract for being a part of &quot;The NFL Today&quot; because of his statements calling homosexuality a sin. Both the Green Bay Packers and the NFL objected to the ads, since White had appeared in his football uniform without the consent of the team or the league. Later versions of the ad removed the uniform.

On March 25, 1998, White was invited to address the Wisconsin Legislature and, in an infamous speech, stunned the assembly by reiterating his belief that homosexuality was sinful and a &quot;decision,&quot; while also using racial tropes to stress why God made different races. He said that blacks are gifted at worship and celebration, Japanese and other Asians &quot;can turn a TV into a watch,&quot; Hispanics are gifted at the &quot;family structure&quot; and &quot;can put 20, 30 people into one home,&quot; Indians are gifted in spirituality, and &quot;you guys (meaning the predominately white legislature) do a good job of building businesses and things of that nature, and you know how to tap into money.&quot; On April 2 he faxed the &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; asking for forgiveness, but in 2000, shortly after signing with the Carolina Panthers, he reversed himself by saying &quot;I wouldn’t change anything&quot; about the speech. Many were angry.

==Death and legacy==
On the morning of December 26, 2004, White was rushed from his home in Cornelius, North Carolina, to a nearby hospital in Huntersville, North Carolina, where he was pronounced dead. It was later identified that the cause of his death was due to arrhythmia. According to the Mecklenburg County Medical Examiner&#x27;s Office, the most likely cause of the arrhythmia was cardiac and pulmonary sarcoidosis, which White had lived with for years. It was also stated that sleep apnea, with which White had been diagnosed, may have contributed to his death.

White&#x27;s widow, Sara, in conjunction with the Sleep Wellness Institute, founded the Reggie White Sleep Disorders Research and Education Foundation, dedicated to all people having access to treatment for sleep disorders, regardless of their socio-economic status.

&quot;Crescent Rising&quot; is another program of the Reggie White Foundation, begun in May 2007, that offers free demolition services to homeowners in the metropolitan New Orleans area affected by Hurricane Katrina. The Crescent Rising program was created to expedite demolition through the encouragement of private sector involvement in order to speed the recovery of the community from hurricane damage. The foundation demolished its first home in June 2007.

==Honors==
===Jersey number retirements===

During the 2005 season, the Philadelphia Eagles, the Green Bay Packers, and the University of Tennessee retired White&#x27;s number 92 jersey.

The University of Tennessee retired White&#x27;s jersey at a halftime presentation on October 1, 2005, during a game against Ole Miss, the 3rd of such retirement in the modern era of football at the school; a commemorative sign was also unveiled in the south end of Neyland Stadium. During a halftime presentation at Lambeau Field on September 18, 2005, White became the 5th Green Bay Packer to have his number retired by the franchise. On December 5, 2005, the Philadelphia Eagles retired his jersey in a halftime ceremony during the Eagles&#x27; &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game against the Seattle Seahawks, which were coached by Mike Holmgren, White&#x27;s former coach in Green Bay. White became the first and only player (as of January 2025) in NFL history to have his number officially retired by multiple teams. The Packers and the Eagles also wore a helmet decal honoring White for the remaining games in the season.

===Hall of Fame election===
White was posthumously elected to the Professional Football Hall of Fame on his first ballot on February 4, 2006. He was enshrined at a ceremony on August 5, 2006, in Canton, OH. Reggie&#x27;s wife and now widow, Sara White, delivered her husband&#x27;s acceptance speech at the ceremony. She was introduced by their son, Jeremy White.

White was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 2005, and the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame in 2007. He was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 2006.

===Named streets===
The official sign-hanging for Reggie White Boulevard took place in 2008, at the intersection of 20th and Carter Street in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Reggie White Way in Green Bay, Wisconsin, is off Lombardi Avenue near Lambeau Field.

<doc id="540997" wikidata="Q1201014" url="?curid=540997" title="Balloon Fight">
<text>is an action video game developed by Nintendo and HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was originally released for arcades as VS. Balloon Fight, with the console version releasing in Japan in 1985 and internationally in 1986.

The gameplay is similar to the 1982 game &quot;Joust&quot; from Williams Electronics. The home Nintendo Entertainment System version was ported to the NEC PC-8801 in October 1985, the Sharp X1 in November 1985, the Game Boy Advance as &quot;Balloon Fight-e&quot; for the e-Reader in the United States on September 16, 2002, and as part of the Famicom Mini Series in Japan on May 21, 2004. It was later rereleased through Nintendo&#x27;s Virtual Console and NES Classic Edition. It was released on Nintendo Switch Online in 2018.

==Gameplay==

The player controls an unnamed Balloon Fighter with two balloons attached to his helmet. Repeatedly pressing the A button or holding down the B button causes the Balloon Fighter to flap his arms and rise into the air. If a balloon is popped, the player&#x27;s flotation is decreased, making it harder to rise. A life is lost if both balloons are popped by enemy Balloon Fighters, if the player falls in the water, gets eaten by the large piranha near the surface of the water, or is hit by lightning.

There are two modes of play: the 1-player/2-player game where the goal is to clear the screen of enemies, and Balloon Trip where the goal is to avoid obstacles in a side-scrolling stage. The original arcade game does not include Balloon Trip, but all the level layouts are completely different so as to take advantage of vertical scrolling in addition to some minor gameplay differences.

===1-player/2-player game===
In this mode, players have to defeat all of the enemies on screen to clear the stage. This mode can be played alone or co-operatively with a second player. Each player starts with three extra lives. The 3DS &quot;Balloon Fight&quot; port comes with the Download Play option, that allows player to play along with a friend that has another 3DS system.

Enemy Balloon Fighters float around the screen and the player must hit their balloons to defeat them. The enemy can also fall into the water or be eaten by the fish while flying close to the water&#x27;s surface. If an enemy is defeated or falls into the water, a bubble will rise up the screen which can be hit for extra points. As play progresses through the stages, the number of enemies and platforms increases.

In every three stages there is a bonus stage, where the goal is to burst all of the balloons that float up the screen from the chimneys at the bottom.

===Balloon Trip===
Ballon Trip is a single-player game where the goal is to avoid the lightning sparks and collect the balloons, aiming to move up the ranks and compete for the high score. The player starts with one life.

==Ports, sequels, and references==
The home Nintendo Entertainment System version was ported to the NEC PC-8801 in October 1985, the Sharp X1 in November 1985, the Game Boy Advance as &quot;Balloon Fight-e&quot; for the e-Reader in the United States on September 16, 2002, and as part of the Famicom Mini Series in Japan on May 21, 2004. It can also be played in the first &quot;Animal Crossing&quot;, both through its Nintendo Space World 2000 demo and in the final game.

Nintendo released a Game &amp; Watch version of the same name, based on the NES version&#x27;s Balloon Trip mode. The protagonist is &quot;a Balloon Man&quot;. Unlike Balloon Fighters, Balloon Men use rocket suits instead of flapping their hands to elevate while holding balloons.

A sequel to &quot;Balloon Fight&quot; called &quot;Balloon Kid&quot; was released in October 1990 in North America and on January 31, 1991, in Europe for the Game Boy, which expands from the game&#x27;s roots and revamped it into a full platforming adventure. This title was not released in Japan on the Game Boy, but colorized versions titled as &quot;Hello Kitty World&quot; (published by &quot;Character Soft&quot;) for the Famicom and &quot;Balloon Fight GB&quot; for the Game Boy Color were later released only in Japan.

In September 2001, the game was ported to the Sharp Zaurus series of PDAs.

Balloon Fighter and Flipper trophies are obtainable in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, and the Flipper is also a usable item, replacing the Bumper from the previous game. The Balloon Fighter was considered for a playable role during the development of &quot;Melee&quot;, but the Ice Climbers were chosen instead. The original background music for the Balloon Trip in &quot;Balloon Fight&quot; can be heard in &quot;Melee&quot;″s Icicle Mountain stage as alternate music. The giant fish makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;. It appears on the &quot;Ice Climber&quot;-based stage, the Summit, where it tries to attack the players from the sea. In addition, a remixed version of the main theme, titled &quot;Balloon Trip&quot; is available for the Summit stage as well. Stickers of the Balloon Fighter and the Balloon Fight Enemy can be collected in &quot;Brawl&quot;. In addition, the Villager from the &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; series uses the Balloon Fighter&#x27;s helmet as one of his special moves in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot;. In the 3DS version of the same game, a stage based on &quot;Balloon Fight&quot; appears with the original 8-bit graphics; the same stage returns in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; and Balloon Fighter appears as a Spirit in said game.

In the &quot;WarioWare, Inc.&quot; series, some of 9-Volt&#x27;s games are based on &quot;Balloon Fight&quot;. In &quot;&quot;, there is also a minigame functioning as a three-dimensional version of Balloon Trip; players use the Wii Remote only for the microgame version, and also use the Nunchuk in the complete 3D Balloon Trip.

The original tech demo for &quot;Yoshi Touch &amp; Go&quot; was called &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Balloon Trip&quot;. &quot;Balloon Fight&quot; is the theme for Touch Mode in &quot;Tetris DS&quot;, although the mode itself has almost nothing to do with the game other than the music and decorative graphics.

In April 2007, Club Nintendo released &quot;Tingle&#x27;s Balloon Fight&quot; for the Nintendo DS, an exclusive game featuring Tingle, a Nintendo character who originated from &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series. The game is a remake of the home version, featuring the &quot;Balloon Fight&quot; and &quot;Balloon Trip&quot; modes. The levels are expanded slightly to utilize both screens, similar to the arcade game except based entirely around the NES levels. A gallery that contained concept art was also included, where each piece could be unlocked by completing specific in-game tasks.

The Balloon Fighter appears in &quot;Super Mario Maker&quot; as an unlockable Mystery Mushroom costume as part of an update.

&quot;Balloon Fight&quot; has been re-released as part of Nintendo&#x27;s Virtual Console. The game was released in Europe on June 8, 2007, followed by a release in North America on July 16, and Japan on November 12. The game was released on Virtual Console for Nintendo 3DS as part of that system&#x27;s Ambassador Program in September 2011.

In &quot;Nintendo Land&quot;, there is an attraction called Balloon Trip Breeze that is similar to Balloon Trip from the original &quot;Balloon Fight&quot;.

The game was released on the Wii U Virtual Console service on January 23, 2013, in North America until February 23, as part of a promotion celebrating the 30th anniversary of the release of the original Nintendo Famicom. &quot;Balloon Fight&quot; became the first Wii U Virtual Console title to be released. In November 2016, the game (alongside 29 other games) was included in the NES Classic Edition (Nintendo Classic Mini in Europe).

The NES version of &quot;Balloon Fight&quot; was re-released as one of the launch titles for Nintendo Switch Online on September 18, 2018.

The original arcade version, &quot;Vs. Balloon Fight&quot;, was ported by Hamster Corporation and released on the Nintendo Switch as part of &quot;Arcade Archives&quot; series on December 27, 2019.

== Release ==
Similar to other early Nintendo titles, the exact date of the console release is difficult to pinpoint. It was first scheduled for June 1986, was later changed to August, but very likely came out in September.

<doc id="541000" wikidata="Q203324" url="?curid=541000" title="Siesta">
<text>A siesta (from Spanish, pronounced and meaning &quot;nap&quot;) is a short nap taken in the early afternoon, often after the midday meal. Such a period of sleep is a common tradition in some countries, particularly those in warm-weather zones. The &quot;siesta&quot; can refer to the nap itself, or more generally to a period of the day, generally between 2 and 5p.m. This period is used for sleep, as well as leisure, midday meals, or other activities.

Siestas are historically common throughout the Mediterranean and Southern Europe, the Middle East, and mainland China. The siesta is an old tradition in Spain and, through Spanish influence, in most of Latin America and the Philippines. The Spanish word is originally derived from the Latin phrase (&#x27;sixth [hour]&#x27;, counting from dawn, hence &quot;midday rest&quot;).

Factors explaining the geographical distribution of the modern siesta are warm temperatures and heavy intake of food at midday meals. Combined, these two factors contribute to the feeling of post-lunch drowsiness. In many countries that practice the siesta, the summer heat can be unbearable in the early afternoon, making a midday break at home welcome.
==Biological need for naps==
The timing of sleep in humans depends upon a balance between homeostatic sleep propensity, the need for sleep as a function of the amount of time elapsed since the last adequate sleep episode, and circadian rhythms which determine the ideal timing of a correctly structured and restorative sleep episode. The homeostatic pressure to sleep starts growing upon awakening. The circadian signal for wakefulness starts building in the (late) afternoon. As professor of sleep medicine Charles Czeisler notes, &quot;the circadian system is set up in a beautiful way to override the homeostatic drive for sleep.&quot;

Thus, in many people, there is a dip when the drive for sleep has been building for hours and the drive for wakefulness has not yet started. This is, again quoting Czeisler, &quot;a great time for a nap&quot;. The drive for wakefulness intensifies through the evening, making it difficult to get to sleep 2–3 hours before one&#x27;s usual bedtime when the &quot;wake maintenance zone&quot; ends.

==In different countries==
Taking a long lunch break including a nap is common in a number of Mediterranean, tropical, and subtropical countries. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; of 13 February 2007 reports at length on studies in Greece that indicate that those who nap have less risk of heart attacks.

In the United States, the United Kingdom, and a growing number of other countries, a short sleep has been referred to as a &quot;power nap&quot;, a term coined by Cornell University social psychologist James Maas and recognized by other research scientists such as Sara Mednick as well as in the popular press. Siesta is also practiced in some still colder regions, such as Patagonia. The power nap is called &quot;riposo&quot; in Northern Italy and &quot;pennichella&quot; or &quot;pisolino&quot; in Southern Italy.

It used to be the custom in Russia, with Adam Olearius stating such was &quot;the custom of the Countrey, where sleep is as necessary after Dinner as in the Night&quot;. One source of hostility toward False Dmitriy I was that he did not &quot;...indulge in the siesta.&quot;

In Southern Italy, the siesta is called &quot;controra&quot; (from contro (&quot;counter&quot;) + ora &quot;hour&quot;) that is considered a magical time of the day, in which the world comes back into the possession of ghosts and spirits. In Dalmatia (coastal Croatia), the traditional afternoon nap is known as &quot;pižolot&quot; (from Venetian &quot;pixolotto&quot;). 

In Egypt, as with other Middle Eastern countries, government workers typically work for six hours a day, six days a week. Due to this schedule, workers do not eat lunch at work, but instead leave work around 2 pm and eat their main meal, which is the heaviest, at lunchtime. Following the heavy lunch, they take a taaseela or nap and have tea upon waking up. For dinner, they usually have a smaller meal.

Einhard&#x27;s &quot;Life of Charlemagne&quot; describes the emperor&#x27;s summertime siestas: &quot;In summer, after his midday meal, he would eat some fruit and take another drink; then he would remove his shoes and undress completely, just as he did at night, and rest for two or three hours.&quot;

In China, taking a nap after lunch, known as 午睡 (noon sleep), is a common practice among people. Surveys indicate that about two-thirds of the Chinese population habitually takes afternoon naps, with the average duration being approximately 30 minutes.

===Spain===

In modern Spain, the midday nap during the working week is being gradually abandoned among the adult working population. According to a 2009 survey, 16.2 percent of Spaniards polled claimed to take a nap &quot;daily&quot;, whereas 22 percent did so &quot;sometimes&quot;, 3.2 percent &quot;weekends only&quot; and the remainder, 58.6 percent, &quot;never&quot;. The share of those who claimed to have a nap daily had diminished by 7 percent compared to a previous poll in 1998. Nearly three out of four siesta-takers claimed to take siestas on the sofa rather than the bed.
The habit is more likely among the elderly or during summer holidays, in order to avoid the high temperatures of the day and extend social life until the cooler late evenings and nights.

English-language media often conflates the siesta with the two to three hour lunch break that is characteristic of Spanish working hours, even though the working population is less likely to have time for a siesta and the two events are not necessarily connected. In fact, the average Spaniard works longer hours than almost all their European counterparts (typically 11-hour days, from 9 am to 8 pm).

As for the origins of the practice in Spain, the scorching summer heat predominant mostly in the South is thought to have motivated those doing agrarian work to take a break to avoid the hottest part of the day and be able to work longer hours when it is cooler. In cities, the economic situation in Spain during the post-Spanish Civil War years was dismal. At that time, a long midday break—with or without a siesta—was necessary for those commuting between the part-time jobs which were common in the sputtering economy. This situation was soon followed by the advent of a modern economy and urbanization.

==Cardiovascular benefits==
The siesta habit has been associated with a 37 percent reduction in coronary mortality, possibly due to reduced cardiovascular stress mediated by daytime sleep.

Epidemiological studies on the relations between cardiovascular health and siesta have led to conflicting conclusions, possibly because of poor control of confounding variables, such as physical activity. It is possible that people who take a siesta have different physical activity habits, for example, waking earlier and scheduling more activity during the morning. Such differences in physical activity may lead to different 24-hour profiles in cardiovascular function. Even if such effects of physical activity can be discounted in explaining the relationship between siesta and cardiovascular health, it is still not known whether the daytime nap itself, a supine posture, or the expectancy of a nap is the most important factor.

<doc id="541024" wikidata="Q2383873" url="?curid=541024" title="Cadafael, King of Gwynedd">
<text>Cadafael ( or ; meaning &quot;Cadafael, son of Cynfedd&quot;) was King of Gwynedd (reigned 634 – c. 655). He came to the throne when his predecessor, King Cadwallon ap Cadfan, was killed in battle, and his primary notability is in having gained the disrespectful sobriquet Cadafael Cadomedd (fully translated into ).

Unusual for the era, King Cadafael was not a member of one of the leading families of Gwynedd. His name appears in the &quot;Welsh Triads&quot; as one of the &quot;Three kings, who were of the sons of strangers&quot; (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Three Peasant Kings&quot;), where he is identified as &quot;Cadafael, son of Cynfeddw in Gwynedd&quot;.

Cadafael&#x27;s reign was a critical time for the future of the &quot;Cymry&quot; (i.e., the Welsh and the Brythonic &quot;Men of the North&quot; taken together, exclusive of all others). There was an alliance of the &quot;Cymry&quot; with Penda of Mercia initially forged by Cadwallon ap Cadfan, and there was ongoing warfare against the then-ascendant Kingdom of Northumbria.

Though the alliance was effective and enjoyed several notable successes, it would end disastrously with the death of Penda and a Northumbrian supremacy both in the north and in the English Midlands. The kingdoms of Pengwern, Manaw Gododdin, Gododdin, and Rheged would be permanently obliterated. The kingdoms of Gwynedd, Powys, and Alt Clud would be diminished. The blame for it fell hardest on Cadafael&#x27;s reputation.

== Background ==
When Cadafael&#x27;s predecessor Cadwallon ap Cadfan came to the throne c. 625, the fortunes of the Kingdom of Gwynedd were at low ebb. Edwin of Northumbria was everywhere successful, having conquered and absorbed the Cymry of Elmet and decisively defeated the Welsh at Chester in 616. Edwin would launch a successful occupation of Lindsey in 625, and he invaded and defeated Wessex in 626. He would also invade and occupy Anglesey, besieging Cadwallon on &quot;Ynys Seiriol&quot; (), off easternmost Anglesey, and forcing him to flee to Ireland.

When Cadwallon returned he was able to restore Gwynedd to a position of viability. This was largely accomplished through an alliance of the Welsh kings of Gwynedd, Powys and Pengwern with the ambitious Penda, king of Anglian Mercia, who like the Welsh was threatened by Edwin&#x27;s successes. Together they would contest Northumbria&#x27;s rise, and the alliance would ultimately defeat and kill Edwin in 633 at the Battle of Hatfield Chase () near Doncaster in South Yorkshire. Northumbria was then split back into its separate predecessor kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira, and Cadwallon defeated and killed their new kings, Eanfrith of Bernicia and Osric of Deira, as well. Northumbria&#x27;s core lands were then devastated.

Cadwallon&#x27;s success had brought renewed hope for a bright future, but it was transitory. Eanfrith&#x27;s Bernician successor Oswald would reunite Northumbria into one kingdom, leading off at the Battle of Heavenfield (&quot;Bellum Cantscaul&quot; in the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot;) near Hexham in 634, where he defeated and killed Cadwallon.

== Cadafael&#x27;s reign ==
Cadafael renewed Cadwallon&#x27;s alliance with Penda and the other Welsh kings, and the wars against Northumbria continued in the north and the English Midlands. Sometime between 635 and 641 Penda defeated the Kingdom of East Anglia and killed King Egric. He would also kill Egric&#x27;s successor Anna in 654, establishing himself as the dominant power in the region. The most significant action occurred at the Battle of Maserfield () in 642/644, assumed to be near Oswestry. There Penda and his Welsh allies defeated and killed Oswald.

The wars went less well in the north. Northumbria secured the entire eastern coastal region of Lothian (i.e., Gododdin) in 638 or shortly thereafter, and there were battles against the men of Alt Clud (the Brythonic predecessor state of Strathclyde) in the 640s. While the outcome of these battles is not given in the historical record, most of what is now southern Scotland came under Northumbrian control, suggesting Northumbrian success. However, Penda and his alliance was still a major threat, and they besieged Oswald&#x27;s Bernician successor Oswiu at his fortress of Bamburgh in 650 or 651, though they did not defeat him.

The defining moment came in 655 when Penda again led an alliance of Mercians, Welsh, Deirans, and East Anglians against Bernicia, besieging Oswiu at a stronghold somewhere in the north and compelling him to sue for peace. Having won this war at great cost, the members of the alliance returned south, the Welsh, in particular, pleased to have reclaimed items of dignity (the so-called &quot;Restoration of Iudeu&quot;) taken from the kingdom of Gododdin or Manaw Gododdin by the Northumbrians.

However, while Oswiu had been beaten he had not been defeated. With many of its leaders having been killed in battle, the alliance was caught unawares in a sortie by Oswiu at the Winwaed (, its location uncertain). Penda was killed, thus ending the alliance and ensuring a Bernician supremacy.

Oswiu quickly followed up his defeat of Penda by overrunning Mercia and launching a surprise assault on Pengwern&#x27;s &quot;llys&quot; (), killing King Cynddylan and virtually wiping out the entire royal family. Thereafter Pengwern disappears from the historical record, with some of its survivors moving westward to Mathrafal, and any who remained becoming part of a Mercian subkingdom.

== End of an epoch ==
Oswiu would go on to re-unite Bernicia and Deira into Northumbria and establish a temporary dominance over Mercia, becoming the premier military and political power north of the Humber Estuary. Mercia would soon throw off the Northumbrian occupation and recover to become the premier military and political power in the English Midlands.

The future was much different for the Cymry of the Old North and North Wales. While Alt Clud would recover its independence and re-emerge as a state, the kingdoms of Manaw Gododdin, Gododdin, and Rheged were permanently destroyed and disappear from the historical record. Gwynedd would decline further until it would be unable to defend its own heartland from invasion and devastating raids, not to re-emerge as a regional power for 200 years. Powys was also weakened, and would not again become a military power until joined with Gwynedd under Rhodri the Great some 200 years later.

The death of Penda in 655 marks the end of the &quot;heroic age&quot; of the Welsh bards.

== Blame ==
It is not known when Cadafael&#x27;s reign ended, but it is customary to assume that it must have been shortly after Penda&#x27;s defeat. There is no contemporary account of the events, but writing some 180 years later Nennius would say that Cadafael had left for home the night before the battle, in his ally&#x27;s hour of greatest need, implying it was a deliberate decision (i.e., by calling him the &quot;Battle-Decliner&quot;). It is unlikely that Cadafael would have been chosen king, or would have reigned so long, or that Penda would have engaged in a 20-year alliance with him, had this been his character.

In the medieval &quot;Welsh Triads&quot;, the death of King Iago ap Beli is described as the result of an axe-blow by one of his own men, a certain Cadafael Wyllt (). In his &quot;Celtic Britain&quot;, John Rhŷs notes that the &quot;Annals of Tigernach&quot; mention Iago&#x27;s death and use the word &quot;dormitat&quot; (or &quot;dormitato&quot;, meaning &quot;sleep&quot; in the sense of a euphemism for death), contradicting the notion of a violent death.

In the &quot;Dialogue between Myrddin and his sister Gwenddydd&quot; () of the &quot;Red Book of Hergest&quot;, a succession of future kings is given in a prophecy, listing them correctly up to Cadwallon ap Cadfan, but then omitting Cadafael and listing Cadwallon&#x27;s son Cadwaladr ap Cadwallon as following his father on the throne.

Whether deserved or not, disaffection for Cadafael and his name seems to have been genuine. An American contributor to an 1874 publication, in an article on Welsh names, noted that &quot;Cadafael is still a name of opprobrium&quot;, adding that he was unaware of the reason.

<text>The Sega CD, originally released as the in most regions outside of North America and Brazil, is an add-on device for the Sega Genesis video game console, designed and produced by Sega. It was released in Japan in 1991, North America in 1992 and in PAL regions in 1993. The device adds a CD-ROM drive to the console, allowing the user to play CD-based games and providing additional hardware functionality. It can also play audio CDs and CD+G discs. While the add-on did contain a faster central processing unit than the Genesis, as well as some enhanced graphics capabilities, the main focus of the device was to expand the size of games. The Sega CD sold 2.24 million units worldwide and was officially discontinued in 1996.

There are  games on this list. 57 were released only in Japan, 38 were released only in North America, and 4 were released only in Europe. Of the games released, there are six titles (marked with a † in the title for the game) that were also released in formats that used a combination of the Sega CD and the 32X. Games that were announced or reported to be in development for the Sega CD, but never released, are located at the list of cancelled Sega CD games.

<text>ASARCO (American Smelting and Refining Company) is a mining, smelting, and refining company based in Tucson, Arizona, which mines and processes primarily copper. The company has been a subsidiary of Grupo México since 1999.

Its three largest open-pit mines are the Mission, Silver Bell and Ray mines in Arizona. Its mines produce of copper a year. ASARCO conducts solvent extraction and electrowinning at the Ray and Silver Bell mines in Pima County, Arizona, and Pinal County, Arizona, and operates a smelter in Hayden, Arizona. ASARCO&#x27;s smelting plant in El Paso, Texas, was suspended in 1999 and then demolished on April 13, 2013. Before closing, the plant produced of anodes each year. Refining at the mines as well as at a copper refinery in Amarillo, Texas, produce of refined copper each year.

ASARCO&#x27;s hourly workers are primarily represented by the United Steelworkers.

ASARCO has 20 superfund sites across the United States, and it is subject to considerable litigation over pollution. After emerging from bankruptcy in 2008, it made a settlement with the government of $1.79 billion for contamination at various sites; the funds were allotted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for cleanup at 26 sites around the country.

== History ==
ASARCO was founded in 1888 as the American Smelting and Refining Company by Henry H. Rogers, William Rockefeller, Adolph Lewisohn, Robert S. Towne, Anton Eilers, and Leonard Lewisohn. From 1901 to 1959, American Smelting and Refining was included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

In April 1901, the Guggenheim family gained control of the company, and in 1905, bought the Tacoma smelter from the Bunker Hill Mining Company. ASARCO eventually controlled 90% of the U.S. lead production, essentially becoming a smelter trust.

On January 11, 1916, sixteen ASARCO employees were killed and mutilated by Pancho Villa&#x27;s men near the town of Santa Isabel, Chihuahua. It was one of the incidents that sparked the Mexican Expedition, a United States Army attempt to capture or kill Villa.

Based in Tucson, Arizona, the company grew to conduct mining, smelting, and refining of primarily copper. Open-pit mining is primarily utilized as the most efficient method of recovering this metal; the company&#x27;s three largest such works are the Mission, Silver Bell, and the Ray mines in Arizona. The company had also operated in silver mining in Idaho. Its mines produce of copper a year.

ASARCO conducts solvent extraction and electrowinning at the Ray and Silver Bell mines in Pima County, Arizona, and Pinal County, Arizona, and operates a smelter in Hayden, Arizona. It also had a smelting plant in El Paso, Texas, operations of which were suspended.

In 1975 it officially changed its name to ASARCO Incorporated. In 1999 it was acquired by Grupo México, which had begun as ASARCO&#x27;s 49%-owned Mexican subsidiary in 1965.

On August 9, 2005, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Corpus Christi, Texas under then-president Daniel Tellechea.

As of 2019, ASARCO operates two primary locations in the United States, a mining and smelting complex in Arizona and a copper refinery in Amarillo, Texas.

== Pollution and environmental issues ==


ASARCO has been found responsible for environmental pollution at 20 Superfund sites across the U.S. by the Environmental Protection Agency. Among those sites are:
#American Smelting and Refining Co., located in Omaha, Nebraska. Plant dissembled, remediation completed and site reused.
#Interstate Lead Company, or ILCO, labeled EPA Site ALD041906173, and located in Leeds, Jefferson County, Alabama
#Argo Smelter, Omaha &amp; Grant Smelter, labeled EPA Site COD002259588, and located at Vasquez Boulevard and I-70 in Denver, Colorado
#&quot;Smeltertown&quot;, El Paso County, Texas, where the copper plant&#x27;s furnaces were illegally used to dispose of hazardous waste. The plant has since been dismantled.
#California Gulch mine and river systems in Leadville, Colorado;
#Summitville Consolidated Mining Corp., Inc. (SCMCI), now bankrupt, EPA Site COD983778432, in Del Norte, Rio Grande County, Colorado;
#ASARCO Globe Plant, EPA Site COD007063530, Globeville, near South Platte River, Denver and Adams County, Colorado;
#Bunker Hill Mining and Metallurgical, Coeur d&#x27;Alene River Basin, Idaho;
#Kin-Buc Landfill in New Jersey;
#Tar Creek (Ottawa County) lead and zinc operations and surrounding residences in Oklahoma;
#Commencement Bay, Near Shore/Tide Flats smelter, groundwater, and residences in Tacoma and Ruston, Washington.
#Everett Smelter, Everett, Washington.
#Murray, Utah lead smelter operation, since reclaimed as part of EPA Superfund program and now the location of the Intermountain Medical Center.

== Litigation history ==

After the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment sued ASARCO for damages to natural resources in 1983, the EPA placed the ASARCO Globe Plant on its National Priorities List of Superfund sites, with ASARCO to pay for the site&#x27;s cleanup.

In 1972 ASARCO&#x27;s downtown Omaha plant in Nebraska was found to be releasing high amounts of lead into the air and ground surrounding the plant. In 1995 ASARCO submitted a demolition and site cleanup plan to the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality for their impact on the local residential area. Fined $3.6 million in 1996 for discharging lead and other pollutants into the Missouri River, ASARCO closed its Omaha plant in July 1997. After extensive site cleanup, the land was turned over to the City of Omaha as a park. All of East Omaha, comprising more than 8,000 acres (32 km2), was declared a Superfund site. As of 2003, 290 acres (1.2 km2) had been cleaned.

In 1991 the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Tribe filed suit under CERCLA against Hecla Mining Company, ASARCO and other defendants for damages and cleanup costs downstream of what has been designated as the Bunker Hill Mine and Smelting Complex Superfund site. Contamination had affected Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene and the Saint Joe River, as well as related waters and lands, and cleanup had been under way since the early 1980s. In 1996 the United States joined the suit. In 2008 after emerging from bankruptcy, ASARCO LLC settled for $452 million for contributions to this site. This was part of a nearly $2 billion settlement (see below) with the US for a total of 26 sites.

In 2007, the Environmental Protection Agency released the results of soil and air tests in Hayden, Arizona, taken adjacent to the ASARCO Hayden Smelter. The results showed abnormally high amounts of pollutants that violate prescribed health standards. Arsenic, lead and copper were among the most egregious pollutants found in Hayden. As a consequence of the contamination, the EPA proposed to add Hayden, Arizona, to the list of Federal Superfund sites. This action would provide funding to clean up the contamination. ASARCO fought the action, supported by Democratic Gov. Janet Napolitano, who said: &quot;I am asking that the EPA delay final decision on listing until March 31, 2008. This would provide ample time for the EPA, in close coordination with ADEQ, to enter an agreement with ASARCO to conduct remedial actions...&quot; After emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2008, ASARCO made a settlement with the government of $1.79 billion for contamination at various sites; the funds were allotted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for cleanup at 26 sites around the country. A final settlement for $1.79 billion was made in 2009 for up 80 sites, including one of the most notorious, the smelting plant at El Paso, Texas, for which cleanup was set to start in 2010.

== Documentary ==
ASARCO&#x27;s Tar Creek Superfund site was the subject of the film documentary &quot;Tar Creek&quot; (2009), made by Matt Myers. At one time, Tar Creek was considered to be the worst environmental problem on the EPA&#x27;s list of more than 1200 sites.

<text>John Howard Northrop (July 5, 1891 – May 27, 1987) was an American biochemist who, with James Batcheller Sumner and Wendell Meredith Stanley, won the 1946 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The award was given for these scientists&#x27; isolation, crystallization, and study of enzymes, proteins, and viruses. Northrop was a Professor of Bacteriology and Medical Physics, Emeritus, at University of California, Berkeley.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Northrop was born in Yonkers, New York to John Isaiah, a zoologist and instructor at Columbia University who is a member of the Havemeyer family, and Alice Rich Northrop, a teacher of botany at Hunter College. His father died in a lab explosion two weeks before John H. Northrop was born. The son was educated at Yonkers High School and Columbia University, where he earned his BA in 1912 and PhD in chemistry in 1915. During World War I, he conducted research for the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service on the production of acetone and ethanol through fermentation. This work led to studying enzymes.

===Research===
In 1929, Northrop isolated and crystallized the gastric enzyme pepsin and determined that it was a protein. For this achievement, he was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1934. In 1938 he isolated and crystallized the first bacteriophage (a small virus that attacks bacteria), and determined that it was a nucleoprotein. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society that same year. Northrop also isolated and crystallized pepsinogen (the precursor to pepsin), trypsin, chymotrypsin, and carboxypeptidase.

For his 1939 book, &quot;Crystalline Enzymes: The Chemistry of Pepsin, Trypsin, and Bacteriophage&quot;, Northrop was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1949. Northrop was employed by the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York City from 1916 until his retirement in 1961. In 1949 he joined the University of California, Berkeley as Professor of Bacteriology, and later, he was appointed Professor of Biophysics.

===Personal life===

In 1917, Northrop married Louise Walker (1891–1975), with whom he had two children: John, an oceanographer, and Alice, who married Nobel laureate Frederick C. Robbins. The family lived in a small home just outside of Mt. Vernon, New York. As their children grew older and Northrop looked for a more desirable workplace, the family bought a home in Cotuit, Massachusetts. This move shortened Northrop&#x27;s commute to the laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey, and also put him in closer contact with the wilderness which he greatly enjoyed. Northrop committed suicide in Wickenburg, Arizona in 1987.

<doc id="541036" wikidata="Q2107567" url="?curid=541036" title="Clu Clu Land">
<text>is a puzzle video game developed and published by Nintendo in 1984 in Japan for the Famicom. It was released in North America in 1985 as a launch title for the Nintendo Entertainment System, with Europe receiving the game in 1987. Nintendo has re-released the game on many different platforms via emulation, of which includes the Virtual Console digital distribution service on the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U and the Nintendo Switch Online subscription service.

== Title ==
Although &quot;Clu Clu Land&quot; is the official English title for the game, &quot;Clu Clu&quot; is actually an anglicization of &quot;Kuru Kuru&quot;; a Japanese onomatopoeia that refers to something going &quot;around and around&quot;. This is derived from the main gameplay mechanic, in which the Bubbles (the protagonist) moves around mazes via grabbing onto poles, hence spinning &quot;around and around&quot;. The same phrase is also the basis for the title of the Game Boy Advance game &quot;Kuru Kuru Kururin&quot; and its subsequent sequels.

==Gameplay==
In &quot;Clu Clu Land&quot;, the player is a female balloonfish named Bubbles, known as in Japan, who swims around in a maze trying to uncover all the golden Ingots.

The story starts with a type of sea urchin, the Unira, stealing all of the treasures in the underwater kingdom of Clu Clu Land. Bubbles, the heroine, sets out to retrieve the treasure. The object of the game is to uncover all the gold ingots in each stage while avoiding the Unira and Black Holes. Ingots usually form a shape such as a heart or a mushroom. The only way Bubbles can turn around to change directions is by means of Turning Posts located throughout the stages. She can stun the Unira by using a Sound Wave. When they are stunned, she can push them into a wall to get rid of them and receive points. If Bubbles is hurt by the Unira, she will lose a life. A life is also lost if she falls into a Black Hole, or if time runs out. The game ends when Bubbles has lost all her lives.

In later levels, the player must pass over the ingots an odd number of times to uncover them, as they will alternate between their uncovered side and a dull side.

== Ports==
An expanded edition known as was released for the coin-op Nintendo VS. System. It contains twice as many puzzles, a new enemy named Boss Unira, different level themes, and other adjustments. A port of this version was released as the final game for the Family Computer Disk System (FDS), titled &quot;Clu Clu Land: Welcome to New Clu Clu Land&quot;. It contains a few minor enhancements such as difficulty selection.

In September 2001, a port was released for the Sharp Zaurus series of PDAs.

== Reception ==

In a June 1986 survey of the NES catalogue, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s Steven Kosek and Dennis Lynch singled out &quot;Clu Clu Land&quot; and &quot;Ice Climber&quot; for &quot;[keeping their] interest after repeated plays&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Various elements from &quot;Clu Clu Land&quot; appear throughout the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series. Bubbles appears as a trophy in &quot;Melee&quot;, and the Unira enemy appears as an item in the series from &quot;Brawl&quot; onwards. A medley of various tracks from the original game can be selected as background music for a number of stages in several games in the series, and Bubbles and Unira are featured as Spirits in &quot;Ultimate&quot;. 

Bubbles appears as an unlockable playable character in &quot;DK: King of Swing&quot;, which features gameplay inspired by &quot;Clu Clu Land&quot;.
&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; both include microgames based on &quot;Clu Clu Land&quot;.

Both the NES and FDS versions are unlockable in the first &quot;Animal Crossing&quot;, with the latter retitled &quot;Clu Clu Land D&quot; outside Japan. It was playable through its Nintendo Space World 2000 demo as well as the final game. &quot;Clu Clu Land&quot; is included in the &quot;NES Remix&quot; series. It was released for the Nintendo Switch in the eShop in June 2018, by Hamster Corporation as part of the &quot;Arcade Archives&quot; series.

Bubbles is playable in &quot;Super Mario Maker&quot;, appearing as one of the Costume Mario characters.

<text>Forced labour, or unfree labour, is any work relation, especially in modern or early modern history, in which people are employed against their will with the threat of destitution, detention, or violence, including death or other forms of extreme hardship to either themselves or members of their families.

Unfree labour includes all forms of slavery, penal labour, and the corresponding institutions, such as debt slavery, serfdom, corvée and labour camps.

==Definition==
Many forms of unfree labour are also covered by the term forced labour, which is defined by the International Labour Organization (ILO) as all involuntary work or service exacted under the menace of a penalty.

However, under the ILO Forced Labour Convention of 1930, the term forced or compulsory labour does not include:
*&quot;any work or service exacted in virtue of compulsory military service laws for work of a purely military character;&quot;
*&quot;any work or service which forms part of the normal civic obligations of the citizens of a fully self-governing country;&quot;
*&quot;any work or service exacted from any person as a consequence of a conviction in a court of law, provided that the said work or service is carried out under the supervision and control of a public authority and that the said person is not hired to or placed at the disposal of private individuals, companies or associations (requiring that prison farms no longer do convict leasing)&quot;;
*&quot;any work or service exacted in cases of emergency, that is to say, in the event of war, of a calamity or threatened calamity, such as fire, flood, famine, earthquake, violent epidemic or epizootic diseases, invasion by: animal, insect or vegetable pests, and in general any circumstance that would endanger the existence or the well-being of the whole or part of the population&quot;;

==Payment for unfree labour==
If payment occurs, it may be in one or more of the following forms:
* The payment does not exceed subsistence or barely exceeds it;
* The payment is in goods which are not desirable and/or cannot be exchanged or are difficult to exchange; or
* The payment wholly or mostly consists of cancellation of a debt or liability that was itself coerced, or belongs to someone else.

Unfree labour is often more easily instituted and enforced on migrant workers, who have travelled far from their homelands and who are easily identified because of their physical, ethnic, linguistic, or cultural differences from the general population, since they are unable or unlikely to report their conditions to the authorities.

==Modern day unfree labour==
Unfree labour re-emerged as an issue in the debate about rural development during the years following the end of the Second World War, when a political concern of Keynesian theory was not just economic reconstruction (mainly in Europe and Asia) but also planning (in developing &quot;Third World&quot; nations). A crucial aspect of the ensuing discussion concerned the extent to which different relational forms constituted obstacles to capitalist development, and why.

During the 1960s and 1970s, unfree labour was regarded as incompatible with capitalist accumulation, and thus an obstacle to economic growth, an interpretation advanced by exponents of the then-dominant semi-feudal thesis. From the 1980s onwards, however, another and very different Marxist view emerged, arguing that evidence from Latin America and India suggested agribusiness enterprises, commercial farmers and rich peasants reproduced, introduced or reintroduced unfree relations.

However, recent contributions to this debate have attempted to exclude Marxism from the discussion. These contributions maintain that, because Marxist theory failed to understand the centrality of unfreedom to modern capitalism, a new explanation of this link is needed. This claim has been questioned by Tom Brass. He argues that many of these new characteristics are in fact no different from those identified earlier by Marxist theory and that the exclusion of the latter approach from the debate is thus unwarranted.

The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that at least 12.3 million people are victims of forced labour worldwide; of these, 9.8 million are exploited by private agents and more than 2.4 million are trafficked. Another 2.5 million are forced to work by the state or by rebel military groups. From an international law perspective, countries that allow forced labour are violating international labour standards as set forth in the Abolition of Forced Labour Convention (C105), one of the fundamental conventions of the ILO.

According to the &quot;ILO Special Action Programme to Combat Forced Labour&quot; (SAP-FL), global profits from forced trafficked labour exploited by private agents are estimated at US$44.3 billion per year. About 70% of this value (US$31.6 billion) comes from trafficked victims. At least the half of this sum (more than US$15 billion) comes from industrialised countries.
==Trafficking==
Trafficking is a term to define the recruiting, harbouring, obtaining and transportation of a person by use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjecting them to involuntary acts, such as acts related to commercial sexual exploitation (including forced prostitution) or involuntary labour.

== Forms of unfree labour ==
=== Slavery ===

The archetypal and best-known form of unfree labour is chattel slavery, in which individual workers are legally owned throughout their lives, and may be bought, sold or otherwise exchanged by owners, while never or rarely receiving any personal benefit from their labour. Slavery was common in many ancient societies, including ancient Egypt, Babylon, Persia, ancient Greece, Rome, ancient China, the pre-modern Muslim world, as well as many societies in Africa and the Americas. Being sold into slavery was a common fate of populations that were conquered in wars. Perhaps the most prominent example of chattel slavery was the enslavement of many millions of black people in Africa, as well as their forced transportation to the Americas, Asia, or Europe, where their status as slaves was almost always inherited by their descendants.

The term &quot;slavery&quot; is often applied to situations which do not meet the above definitions, but which are other, closely related forms of unfree labour, such as debt slavery or debt-bondage (although not all repayment of debts through labour constitutes unfree labour). Examples are the Repartimiento system in the Spanish Empire, or the work of Indigenous Australians in northern Australia on sheep or cattle stations (ranches), from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century. In the latter case, workers were rarely or never paid, and were restricted by regulations and/or police intervention to regions around their places of work.

In late 16th century Japan, &quot;unfree labour&quot; or slavery was officially banned; but forms of contract and indentured labour persisted alongside the period&#x27;s penal codes&#x27; forced labour. Somewhat later, the Edo period&#x27;s penal laws prescribed &quot;non-free labour&quot; for the immediate families of executed criminals in Article 17 of the (Tokugawa House Laws), but the practice never became common. The 1711 was compiled from over 600 statutes that were promulgated between 1597 and 1696.

According to Kevin Bales in &quot;Disposable People: New Slavery in the Global Economy&quot; (1999), there are now an estimated 27 million slaves in the world.

===Blackbirding===

Blackbirding involves kidnapping or trickery to transport people to another country or far away from home, to work as a slave or low-paid involuntary worker. In some cases, workers were returned home after a period of time.

===Serfdom===
Serfdom bonds labourers to the land they farm, typically in a feudal society. Serfs typically have no legal right to leave, change employers, or seek paid work, though depending on economic conditions many did so anyway. Unlike chattel slaves, they typically cannot be sold separately from the land, and have rights such as the military protection of the lord.

===Truck system===

A truck system, in the specific sense in which the term is used by labour historians, refers to an unpopular or even exploitative form of payment associated with small, isolated and/or rural communities, in which workers or self-employed small producers are paid in either: goods, a form of payment known as truck wages, or tokens, private currency (&quot;scrip&quot;) or direct credit, to be used at a company store, owned by their employers. A specific kind of truck system, in which credit advances are made against future work, is known in the U.S. as debt bondage.

Many scholars have suggested that employers use such systems to exploit workers and/or indebt them. This could occur, for example, if employers were able to pay workers with goods which had a market value below the level of subsistence, or by selling items to workers at inflated prices. Others argue that truck wages were a convenient way for isolated communities, such as during the early colonial settlement of North America, to operate when official currency was scarce.

By the early 20th century, truck systems were widely seen, in industrialised countries, as exploitative; perhaps the most well-known example of this view was a 1947 U.S. hit song &quot;Sixteen Tons&quot;. Many countries have Truck Act legislation that outlaws truck systems and requires payment in cash.

===Mandatory services due to social status===
====Corvée====
Though most closely associated with Medieval Europe, governments throughout human history have imposed regular short stints of unpaid labour upon lower social classes. These might be annual obligations of a few weeks or something similarly regular that lasted for the labourer&#x27;s entire working life. As the system developed in the Philippines and elsewhere, the labourer could pay an appropriate fee and be exempted from the obligation.

====Vetti-chakiri====

A form of forced labour in which peasants and members of lower castes were required to work for free existed in India before independence. This form of labour was known by several names, including &quot;veth&quot;, &quot;vethi&quot;, and .

===Penal labour===

====Labour camps====


Another historically significant example of forced labour was that of political prisoners, people from conquered or occupied countries, members of persecuted minorities, and prisoners of war, especially during the 20th century. The best-known example of this are the concentration camp system run by Nazi Germany in Europe during World War II, the &quot;Gulag&quot; camps run by the Soviet Union, and the forced labour used by the military of the Empire of Japan, especially during the Pacific War (such as the Burma Railway). Roughly 4,000,000 German POWs were used as &quot;reparations labour&quot; by the Allies for several years after the German surrender; this was permitted under the Third Geneva Convention provided they were accorded proper treatment. China&#x27;s (&quot;labour reform&quot;) system and North Korea&#x27;s camps are current examples.

About 12 million forced labourers, most of whom were Poles and Soviet citizens () were employed in the German war economy inside Nazi Germany. More than 2000 German companies profited from slave labour during the Nazi era, including Daimler, Deutsche Bank, Siemens, Volkswagen, Hoechst, Dresdner Bank, Krupp, Allianz, BASF, Bayer, BMW, and Degussa. In particular, Germany&#x27;s Jewish population was subject to slave labour prior to their extermination.

In Asia, according to a joint study of historians featuring Zhifen Ju, Mark Peattie, Toru Kubo, and Mitsuyoshi Himeta, more than 10 million Chinese were mobilised by the Japanese army and enslaved by the Kōa-in for slave labour in Manchukuo and north China. The U.S. Library of Congress estimates that in Java, between 4 and 10 million (Japanese: &quot;manual labourer&quot;) were forced to work by the Japanese military. About 270,000 of these Javanese labourers were sent to other Japanese-held areas in South East Asia. Only 52,000 were repatriated to Java, meaning that there was a death rate of 80%. Also, 6.87 million Koreans were forcefully put into slave labour from 1939 to 1945 in both Japan and Japanese-occupied Korea. 

Kerja rodi (&quot;Heerendiensten&quot;), was the term for forced labour in Indonesia under Dutch colonial rule.

The Khmer Rouge attempted to turn Cambodia into a classless society by depopulating cities and forcing the urban population (&quot;New People&quot;) into agricultural communes. The entire population was forced to become farmers in labour camps.

====Prison labour====
Convict or prison labour is another classic form of unfree labour. The forced labour of convicts has often been regarded with lack of sympathy, because of the social stigma attached to people regarded as common criminals.

Three British colonies in Australia – New South Wales, Van Diemen&#x27;s Land and Western Australia – are examples of the state use of convict labour. Australia received thousands of convict labourers in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries who were given sentences for crimes ranging from those now considered to be minor misdemeanours to such serious offences as murder, rape and incest. A considerable number of Irish convicts were sentenced to transportation for treason while fighting against British rule in Ireland.

More than 165,000 convicts were transported to Australian colonies from 1788 to 1868. Most British or Irish convicts who were sentenced to transportation, however, completed their sentences in British jails and were not transported at all.

In the United States, prison labor has been used for centuries. Prisoners often worked in the jail or prison for the maintenance and upkeep of the facility. Starting in the 1820s, prisoners&#x27; labor was used to make a profit for the facilities. In the United States North in 1823, the New York State prison at Auburn, Auburn Prison, used prison labor to produce goods for sale that helped finance the prison and create a profit, imposing harsh conditions upon prisoners without providing any form of compensation. During its heyday the program, known as the Auburn System, spread to many other U.S. states and parts of Canada.

It is estimated that in the last 50 years more than 50 million people have been sent to Chinese camps.

===Indentured and bonded labour===
A more common form in modern society is indenture, or &quot;bonded labour&quot;, under which workers sign contracts to work for a specific period of time, for which they are paid only with accommodation and sustenance, or these essentials in addition to limited benefits such as cancellation of a debt, or transportation to a desired country.

===Contemporary illegal forced labour===
While historically unfree labour was frequently sanctioned by law, in the present day most unfree labour now revolves around illegal control rather than legal ownership, as all countries have made slavery illegal.

== Permitted exceptions of unfree labour ==
As mentioned above, there are several exceptions of unfree or forced labour recognised by the &quot;International Labour Organization&quot;:

=== Civil conscription ===

Some countries practise forms of civil conscription for different major occupational groups or inhabitants under different denominations like &quot;civil conscription&quot;, &quot;civil mobilization&quot;, &quot;political mobilisation&quot; etc. This obligatory service on the one hand has been implemented due to long-lasting labour strikes, during wartime or economic crisis, to provide basic services like medical care, food supply or supply of the defence industry. On the other hand, this service can be obligatory to provide recurring and inevitable services to the population, like fire services, due to lack of volunteers.

==== Temporary civil conscription ====
Between December 1943 and March 1948 young men in the United Kingdom, the so-called Bevin Boys, had been conscripted for the work in coal mines. In Belgium in 1964, in Portugal and in Greece from 2010 to 2014 due to the severe economic crisis, a system of civil mobilisation was implemented to provide public services as a national interest.

==== Recurring civil conscription ====
In Switzerland in most communities for all inhabitants, no matter if they are Swiss or not, it is mandatory to join the so-called &quot;Militia Fire Brigades&quot;, as well as the obligatory service in Swiss civil defence and protection force.
Conscripts in Singapore are providing the personnel of the country&#x27;s fire service as part of the national service in the Civil Defence Force. 
In Austria and Germany citizens have to join a compulsory fire brigade if a volunteer fire service can not be provided, due to lack of volunteers. In 2018 this regulation is executed only in a handful of communities in Germany and currently none in Austria.

=== Conscription for military service and security forces ===

Beside the conscription for military services, some countries draft citizens for paramilitary or security forces, like internal troops, border guards or police forces. While sometimes paid, conscripts are not free to decline enlistment. Draft dodging or desertion are often met with severe punishment. Even in countries which prohibit other forms of unfree labour, conscription is generally justified as being necessary in the national interest and therefore is one of the five exceptions to the Forced Labour Convention, signed by the most countries in the world.

=== Mandatory community service ===
==== Community services ====
Community service is a non-paying job performed by one person or a group of people for the benefit of their community or its institutions. Community service is distinct from volunteering, since it is not always performed on a voluntary basis. Although personal benefits may be realised, it may be performed for a variety of reasons including citizenship requirements, a substitution of criminal justice sanctions, requirements of a school or class, and requisites for the receipt of certain benefits.

==== &quot;De facto&quot; obligatory community work ====
During the Cold War in some communist countries like Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic or the Soviet Union the originally voluntary work on Saturday for the community called &quot;Subbotnik&quot;, &quot;Voskresnik&quot; or &quot;Akce Z&quot; became &quot;de facto&quot; obligatory for the members of a community.

==== Hand and hitch-up services ====
In some Austrian and German states it is feasible for communities to draft citizens for public services, called hand and hitch-up services. This mandatory service is still executed to maintain the infrastructure of small communities.

<text>MOOD is a hip hop group based in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States, composed of rappers Main Flow, Donte, and record producer Jahson. Originally formed under the name of Three Below Zero, they wound up changing their name to Mood in 1994. They first came to prominence with the Hi-Tek produced single &quot;Hustle on the Side&quot; in 1996. Their 1997 album &quot;Doom&quot; featured production by a young Hi-Tek and a guest appearance by Talib Kweli.

In 2000, they appeared on &quot;Mission Control Presents&quot;, a compilation which featured acts associated with producer Jahson and his record label Mission Control. There were three Mood tracks and three tracks that featured Mood as part of a larger group called Elite Terrorist. Main Flow and Donte are also featured individually on a number of tracks.

Music videos for songs &quot;Hustle On The Side&quot; and &quot;Karma&quot; were produced and aired worldwide. Most notably winning awards on regional and international video programs Video Music Box, Urban Reality, Rap City and DrunkinStyle TV.

In 2011, Mood released their long-awaited follow up to &quot;Doom&quot;, entitled &quot;Live Again&quot;. In the interim, Jahson has an album out as does Main Flow (entitled &quot;Flow Season&quot; along with 7L), Donte is also planning a solo release.
