<text>Sir Philip Nicholas Outram Pullman (born 19 October 1946) is an English writer. His books include the fantasy trilogy &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; and &quot;The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ&quot;, a fictionalised biography of Jesus. In 2008, &quot;The Times&quot; named Pullman one of the &quot;50 greatest British writers since 1945&quot;. In a 2004 BBC poll, he was named the eleventh most influential person in British culture. He was knighted in the 2019 New Year Honours for services to literature.

&quot;Northern Lights&quot;, the first volume in &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;, won the 1995 Carnegie Medal of the Library Association as the year&#x27;s outstanding English-language children&#x27;s book. For the Carnegie&#x27;s 70th anniversary, it was named in the top ten by a panel tasked with compiling a shortlist for a public vote for an all-time favourite. It won that public vote and was named all-time &quot;Carnegie of Carnegies&quot; in June 2007. It was filmed under the book&#x27;s US title, &quot;The Golden Compass&quot;. In 2003, &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; trilogy ranked third in the BBC&#x27;s The Big Read, a poll of 200 top novels voted by the British public.

==Life and career==
Philip Pullman was born in Norwich, England, the son of Audrey Evelyn Pullman (née Merrifield) and Royal Air Force pilot Alfred Outram Pullman. The family travelled with his father&#x27;s job, including to Southern Rhodesia, though most of his formative years were spent in Llanbedr in Ardudwy, Wales.

In 1954, when Pullman was seven, his father, an RAF pilot, was killed in a plane crash in Kenya, being posthumously awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC). In an exchange with a journalist in 2008, Pullman said that, as a boy, he saw his father as &quot;a hero, steeped in glamour, killed in action defending his country&quot;, and who had been &quot;training pilots&quot;. Pullman was then presented with a report from &quot;The London Gazette&quot; of 1954 &quot;which carried the official RAF news of the day [and] said that the medal was given for &#x27;gallant and distinguished service&#x27; during the Mau Mau uprising. &#x27;The main task of the Harvards [the aircraft flown by his father&#x27;s unit] had been bombing and machine-gunning Mau Mau and their hideouts in densely wooded and difficult country.&#x27; This included &#x27;diving steeply into the gorges of [various] rivers, often in conditions of low cloud and driving rain.&#x27; Testing conditions, yes, but not much opposition from the enemy, the journalist in the exchange continued. Very few of the Mau Mau had guns that could land a blow on an aircraft.&quot;

Responding to that new information, Pullman wrote: &quot;My father probably doesn&#x27;t come out of this with very much credit, judged by the standards of modern liberal progressive thought&quot;, and he accepted the revelation as &quot;a serious challenge to his childhood memory.&quot; In the 2017 BBC series documentary &quot;Imagine&quot;, Pullman said that he has since become aware that his father could have crashed his plane deliberately, saying &quot;There was something odd about the crash ... he just took his plane up and flew into the side of a hill&quot;, citing rumours of his father having debt troubles and a problematic love affair. His mother remarried the following year and, following a move to North Wales, Pullman discovered comic books, including &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Batman&quot;, a medium which he continues to enjoy.

In his early years, Pullman attended Taverham Hall School and Eaton House and, from 1957, he was educated at Ysgol Ardudwy in Harlech, Gwynedd, spending time in Norfolk with his grandfather, a clergyman. Around that time, Pullman discovered John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, which would become a major influence on &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;: &quot;I found, in that classroom so long ago, that it had the power to stir a physical response: my heart beat faster, the hair on my head stirred, my skin bristled. Ever since then, that has been my test for poetry, just as it was for A. E. Housman, who dared not think of a line of poetry while he was shaving, in case he cut himself.&quot; 

As a teenager, Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s poetry led him to William Blake: &quot;Thanks to those books, and thanks to my encounter with Ginsberg, and thanks further back to the enlightened local education authority that sent a library van around to the secondary schools in Merionethshire so that I could choose from their shelves the anthology (Donald Allen’s &quot;The New American Poetry 1945-1960&quot;: still in print, still irreplaceable) that contained &quot;Howl&quot;– thanks to those things, I discovered what I believed in. My mind and my body reacted to certain lines from the &quot;Songs of Innocence and of Experience&quot;, from &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot;, from &#x27;Auguries of Innocence&#x27;, from &quot;Europe&quot;, from &quot;America&quot; with the joyful immediacy of a flame leaping to meet a gas jet. What these things meant I didn’t quite know then, and I’m not sure I fully know now. There was no sober period of reflection, consideration, comparison, analysis: I didn’t have to work anything out. I knew they were true in the way I knew that I was alive.&quot;

From 1965, Pullman attended Exeter College, Oxford, receiving a Third-class BA in 1968. In an interview with the &quot;Oxford Student&quot;, he noted that he &quot;did not really enjoy the English course&quot;, and that &quot;I thought I was doing quite well until I came out with my third class degree and then I realised that I wasn&#x27;t – it was the year they stopped giving fourth class degrees otherwise I&#x27;d have got one of those&quot;.

Pullman married Judith Speller in 1970 and they have two sons. At the time of his marriage he began teaching children aged 9 to 13 at Bishop Kirk Middle School in Summertown, North Oxford, as well as writing school plays.

His first published work was &quot;The Haunted Storm&quot;, which was joint-winner of the New English Library&#x27;s Young Writer&#x27;s Award in 1972, but which he refuses to discuss. &quot;Galatea&quot;, an adult fantasy-fiction novel, followed in 1978, but it was his school plays which inspired his first children&#x27;s book, &quot;Count Karlstein&quot;, in 1982. He stopped teaching shortly after the publication of &quot;The Ruby in the Smoke&quot; (1986), a Victorian mystery and the first book in the Sally Lockhart tetralogy.

Between 1988 and 1996, Pullman taught part-time at Westminster College, Oxford, continuing to write children&#x27;s stories. He began &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; in about 1993. The first book, &quot;Northern Lights&quot;, was published in 1995 (&quot;The Golden Compass&quot; in the U.S., 1996). Pullman won both the annual Carnegie Medal and the Guardian Children&#x27;s Fiction Prize, a similar award that authors may not win twice. While working on &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;, he wrote two novellas, &quot;The Firework-Maker&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1995) and &quot;Clockwork, or All Wound Up&quot; (1996), which he calls fairy tales. The trilogy continued with &quot;The Subtle Knife&quot; (1997) and &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot; (2000).

Pullman has been writing full-time since 1996. He continues to deliver talks and writes occasionally for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, including writing and lecturing about education, in which he is often critical of unimaginative education policies. He was awarded a CBE in the New Year&#x27;s Honours list in 2004. In 2004, he was elected President of the Blake Society. In 2004 Pullman also guest-edited &quot;The Mays Anthology&quot;, a collection of new writing from students at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge.

In 2005, Pullman won the annual Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award from the Swedish Arts Council, recognising his career contribution to &quot;children&#x27;s and young adult literature in the broadest sense&quot;. According to the presentation, &quot;Pullman radically injects new life into fantasy by introducing a variety of alternative worlds and by allowing good and evil to become ambiguous.&quot; In every genre, &quot;he combines storytelling and psychological insight of the highest order.&quot;

In 2006, he was one of five finalists for the biennial, international Hans Christian Andersen Medal, and he was the British nominee again in 2012.

In 2008, he started working on &quot;The Book of Dust&quot;, a companion trilogy to his &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;, and &quot;The Adventures of John Blake&quot;, a story for the British children&#x27;s comic &quot;The DFC&quot;, with artist John Aggs.

On 23 November 2007, Pullman was made an honorary professor at Bangor University. In October 2009, he became a patron of the Palestine Festival of Literature. He is also a patron of the Shakespeare Schools Festival, a charity that enables school children across the UK to perform Shakespeare in professional theatres

On 24 June 2009, Pullman was awarded the degree of D.Litt. (Doctor of Letters), &quot;honoris causa&quot;, by the University of Oxford at the Encænia ceremony in the Sheldonian Theatre.

In 2012, during a break from writing &quot;The Book of Dust&quot;, Pullman was asked by Penguin Classics to curate 50 of Grimms&#x27; classic fairytales, from their compendium of over 200 stories. &quot;They are not all of the same quality&quot;, said Pullman. &quot;Some are easily much better than others. And some are obvious classics. You can&#x27;t do a selected Grimms&#x27; without Rumpelstiltskin, Cinderella and so on.&quot;

On 19 October 2017, the first volume of &quot;The Book of Dust&quot; was published by Penguin Random House Children&#x27;s and David Fickling in the UK and by Random House Children&#x27;s in the US. The second title in &quot;The Book of Dust&quot;, &quot;The Secret Commonwealth&quot;, published in October 2019, includes a character named after Nur Huda el-Wahabi, a 16-year-old victim of London&#x27;s Grenfell Tower fire. As part of the charity auction Authors for Grenfell Tower, Pullman offered the highest bidder a chance to name a character in the upcoming trilogy. Ultimately, he raised £32,400.

Pullman was named a Knight Bachelor in the 2019 New Year&#x27;s Honours list. In March 2019, the charity Action for Children&#x27;s Art presented Pullman with their annual J. M. Barrie Award to mark a &quot;lifetime&#x27;s achievement in delighting children&quot;.

A lifelong fan of Norwich City F.C., Pullman penned the foreword to the club&#x27;s official history, published in 2020.

==&quot;His Dark Materials&quot;==
&quot;His Dark Materials&quot; is a trilogy consisting of &quot;Northern Lights&quot; (titled &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; in North America), &quot;The Subtle Knife&quot; and &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot;. &quot;Northern Lights&quot; won the Carnegie Medal for children&#x27;s fiction in the UK in 1995. &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot; was awarded both 2001 Whitbread Prize for best children&#x27;s book and the Whitbread Book of the Year prize in January 2002, the first children&#x27;s book to receive that award. The series won popular acclaim in late 2003, taking third place in the BBC&#x27;s Big Read poll. Pullman has written two companion pieces to the trilogy, &quot;Lyra&#x27;s Oxford&quot; and &quot;Once Upon a Time in the North&quot;. He refers to a third, which will expand his character Will Parry, as the &quot;green book&quot;.

&quot;The Book of Dust&quot;, another trilogy, includes characters and events from &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;. Pullman has said that the new series is neither sequel, nor prequel, but an &quot;equel&quot;. The first book, &quot;La Belle Sauvage&quot;, was published in October 2017 and the second book, &quot;The Secret Commonwealth&quot;, in October 2019.

Pullman has narrated unabridged audiobooks of the three novels in the &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; trilogy; the other parts are read by actors, including Jo Wyatt, Steven Webb, Peter England, Stephen Thorne and Douglas Blackwell.

==Campaigns and views==
Pullman has been a vocal campaigner on a number of issues related to books and politics.

=== Views on writing ===
In the epigraph of &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot;, Pullman writes that &quot;I have stolen ideas from every book I&#x27;ve ever read. My principle for researching a novel is &#x27;Read like a butterfly, write like a bee,&#x27; and if this story contains any honey, it is because of the quality of the nectar I have found in the work of better writers.&quot; He acknowledges his primary influences as Heinrich von Kleist&#x27;s essay &quot;On the Marionette Theater&quot;, Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; and the works of William Blake. He says his favorite book is probably Robert Burton&#x27;s &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot;, describing it as &quot;a funny book about depression written in a very prolix, ornate style.&quot;

=== Views on fantasy ===
In a lecture at the Sea of Faith conference, Pullman said that &quot;the writers we call the greatest of all – Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Proust, George Eliot herself, are those who have created the most lifelike simulacra of real human beings in real human situations. In fact the more profound and powerful the imagination, the closer to reality are the forms it dreams up.&quot; He said he wanted to write fantasy realistically, or write fantastic characters with psychological depth: &quot;Because when I thought about it, there was no reason why fantasy shouldn&#x27;t be realistic, in a psychological sense – and it was the lack of that sort of realism that I objected to in the work of the big Tolkien and all the little Tolkiens.&quot; He says David Lindsay&#x27;s &quot;A Voyage to Arcturus&quot; &quot;shows that fantasy is capable of saying big and important things.&quot; He concludes that fantasy is &quot;a great vehicle when it serves the purposes of realism, and a lot of old cobblers when it doesn&#x27;t.&quot; Pullman says that he sees &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; as &quot;stark realism&quot;, not fantasy. He has praised fantasy authors like Alan Garner and Neil Gaiman.

=== Views on children&#x27;s literature ===
Pullman believes that children deserve quality literature, and that there isn&#x27;t a clear demarcation between children&#x27;s and adult literature. In a talk at the Royal Society of Literature, he quoted C. S. Lewis in &quot;On Three Ways of Writing for Children&quot;: &quot;I now like hock, which I am sure I should not have liked as a child. But I still like lemon-squash. I call this growth or development because I have been enriched: where I formerly had only one pleasure, I now have two.&quot; Pullman says that &quot;It would be nice to think that normal human curiosity would let us open our minds to experience from every quarter, to listen to every storyteller in the marketplace. It would be nice too, occasionally, to read a review of an adult book that said, &#x27;This book is so interesting, and so clearly and beautifully written, that children would enjoy it as well.&#x27;&quot; He is an admirer of Philippa Pearce; when Pullman&#x27;s &quot;Northern Lights&quot; won the Carnegie of Carnegies, Pearce&#x27;s &quot;Tom&#x27;s Midnight Garden&quot; was the runner-up. Pullman said &quot;Personally, I feel they got the initials right but not the name. I don&#x27;t know if the result would be the same in a hundred years&#x27; time; maybe Philippa Pearce would win then.&quot; In 2011, Pullman gave the Philippa Pearce Lecture. 

He is also an admirer of Leon Garfield, &quot;someone who put the best of his imagination into everything he wrote&quot;, particularly praising &quot;The Pleasure Garden&quot;. In a lecture, he said that &quot;one of the things we need to do for children is introduce them to the pleasures of the subtle and complex. One way to do that, of course, is to let them see us enjoying it, and then forbid them to touch it, on the grounds that it&#x27;s too grown-up for them, their minds aren&#x27;t ready to cope with it, it&#x27;s too strong, it&#x27;ll drive them mad with strange and uncontrollable desires. If that doesn&#x27;t make them want to try it, nothing will.&quot;

=== Views on monarchy ===
In 2002, to coincide with the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, Pullman was interviewed for a feature in &quot;The Guardian&quot; on notable republicans. According to Pullman, &quot;The present system is unsustainable, because it is cruel. No individual and no family should be subject to the pressures of publicity and expectation that have beset the Windsors.&quot; Expressing sympathy for the young Prince William, Pullman added, &quot;we can&#x27;t have a quiet, sensible, unobtrusive sort of monarchy because of the mistakes the Windsors have made, and because of the disgusting and unredeemable nature of the tabloid press; so we shall have to have a republic. The one thing to avoid is a political president. Let&#x27;s have a well-respected figure from some other walk of life, and leave politics to the prime minister and parliament.&quot; In 2010, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; described Pullman&#x27;s Jesus in &quot;The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ&quot; as &quot;a proper republican in the Pullman sense of the word: instinctively fraternal and anti-institutional, spreading his rough-and-ready enlightenments across the horizontal axis.&quot;

===Age and gender labelling of books===
In 2008, Pullman led a campaign against the introduction of age bands on the covers of children&#x27;s books, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s based on a one-dimensional view of growth, which regards growing older as moving along a line like a monkey climbing a stick: now you&#x27;re seven, so you read these books; and now you&#x27;re nine so you read these.&quot; More than 1,200 authors, booksellers, illustrators, librarians and teachers joined the campaign; Pullman&#x27;s own publisher, Scholastic, agreed to his request not to put the age bands on his book covers. Joel Rickett, deputy editor of &quot;The Bookseller&quot;, said: &quot;The steps taken by Mr Pullman and other authors have taken the industry by surprise and I think these proposals are now in the balance.&quot;

In 2014, Pullman supported the Let Books Be Books campaign to stop children&#x27;s books being labelled as &quot;for girls&quot; or &quot;for boys&quot;, saying: &quot;I&#x27;m against anything, from age-ranging to pinking and blueing, whose effect is to shut the door in the face of children who might enjoy coming in. No publisher should announce on the cover of any book the sort of readers the book would prefer. Let the readers decide for themselves.&quot;

===Civil liberties===
Pullman has a strong commitment to traditional British civil liberties and is noted for his criticism of growing state authority and government encroachment into everyday life. In February 2009, he was the keynote speaker at the Convention on Modern Liberty in London and wrote an extended piece in &quot;The Times&quot; condemning the Labour government for its attacks on basic civil rights. Later, he and other authors threatened to stop visiting schools in protest at new laws requiring them to be vetted to work with youngsters—though officials claimed that the laws had been misinterpreted.

===Public jury===
In July 2011, Pullman was one of the lead campaigners signing a declaration that called for a 1,000-strong &quot;public jury&quot;, selected at random, to draw up a &quot;public interest first&quot; test to ensure that power was taken away from &quot;remote interest groups&quot;. The declaration was also signed by 56 academics, writers, trade unionists and politicians from the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party.

===Library closures===
In October 2011, Pullman backed a campaign to stop 600 library closures in England, calling it a &quot;war against stupidity&quot;. London Borough of Brent claimed that it was closing half of its libraries to fulfil its &quot;exciting plans&quot; to improve its library service. Pullman said: &quot;All the time, you see, the council had been longing to improve the library service, and the only thing standing in the way was – the libraries.&quot;
Speaking at a conference organised by The Library Campaign and Voices for the Library, he added: The book is second only to the wheel as the best piece of technology human beings have ever invented. A book symbolises the whole intellectual history of mankind; it&#x27;s the greatest weapon ever devised in the war against stupidity. Beware of anyone who tries to make books harder to get at. And that is exactly what these closures are going to do – oh, not intentionally, except in a few cases; very few people are stupid intentionally; but that will be the effect. Books will be harder to get at. Stupidity will gain a little ground.

===Ebook library loans===
In advance of becoming president of the Society of Authors in August 2013, Pullman led a call for authors to be fairly paid for ebook library loans. Under arrangements in force at the time, authors were paid 6p per library loan by the government for physical books, but nothing for ebook loans. In addition, the Society found that publishers had possibly been inadvertently underpaying authors for ebook loans. Altogether, this may have resulted in authors losing up to two-thirds of the income they would have received on the sale and loan of a physical book. Addressing this issue, Pullman said: New media and new forms of buying and lending are all very interesting, for all kinds of reasons, but one principle remains unchanged: authors must be paid fairly for their work. Any arrangement that doesn&#x27;t acknowledge that principle is a bad one, and needs to be changed. That is our whole argument.

===William Blake&#x27;s cottage and memorial stone===
As a long-time enthusiast of William Blake, and president of the Blake Society, Pullman led a campaign in 2014 to buy the Sussex cottage where the poet lived between 1800 and 1803, saying: Surely it isn&#x27;t beyond the resources of a nation that can spend enormous amounts of money on acts of folly and unnecessary warfare, a nation that likes to boast about its literary heritage, to find the money to pay for a proper memorial and a centre for the study of this great poet and artist. Not least because this is the place where he wrote the words now often sung as an alternative (and better) national anthem, the poem known as Jerusalem: &quot;And did those feet in ancient time&quot;. Blake&#x27;s feet walked in Felpham. Let&#x27;s not let this opportunity pass by.

As president of the Blake Society, on 11 August 2018, Pullman inaugurated Blake&#x27;s new memorial gravestone on the site of his grave in Bunhill Fields, following a long campaign by the society.

===Boycott of Brexit 50p coin===
In January 2020, Pullman called for literate people to boycott the newly minted Brexit 50p coin due to the omission of the Oxford comma in its slogan &quot;Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations&quot;. The viewpoint was supported by some, while lexicographer Susie Dent indicated it was optional and Baroness Bakewell said she had been &quot;taught that it was wrong to use the comma in such circumstances&quot;.

=== Presidency of the Society of Authors ===
In 2013 Pullman was elected President of the Society of Authors – the &quot;ultimate honour&quot; awarded by the British writers&#x27; body, and a position first held by Alfred, Lord Tennyson. In January 2016, Pullman resigned as patron of the Oxford Literary Festival in support of the Society of Author&#x27;s campaign for writers to be paid fees at festivals and drew attention to the poor remuneration of writers.

On 10 August 2021 Pullman tweeted a response to what he wrongly thought was criticism of Kate Clanchy&#x27;s teaching memoir &quot;Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me&quot;. His tweet said that those who condemn a book without reading it would be at home with &quot;Boko Haram and the Taliban.&quot; Pullman later deleted the tweet and apologised. On the 11th of August The Society of Authors put out a statement and an interview with Chair of Management Committee Joanne Harris which were described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as the society &quot;distancing&quot; itself from Pullman. Pullman resigned his presidency, later stating that the management committee urging him to apologise for something he hadn’t done had been a factor in his decision to stand down. He later criticised Harris for her &quot;facetious and flippant&quot; public comments and stated that the Society of Authors had become a &quot;vehicle for gesture politics&quot; and called for external review and reform of the organisation.

== Perspective on religion ==
Although Pullman has stated he is &quot;a Church of England atheist, and a 1662 Book of Common Prayer atheist, because that&#x27;s the tradition I was brought up in&quot;, he has also said he is technically an agnostic. He has singled out elements of Christianity for criticism: &quot;if there is a God, and he is as the Christians describe him, then he deserves to be put down and rebelled against.&quot; He has also acknowledged that the same could be said of all religions. 

Pullman has also referred to himself as knowingly &quot;of the Devil&#x27;s party&quot;, a reference to William Blake&#x27;s revisionist view of Milton in &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot;. 
Pullman is a supporter of Humanists UK and an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society. In 2011, he was given a services to Humanism award by the British Humanist Association for his contribution as a longstanding supporter.

On 15 September 2010, Pullman, along with 54 other public figures (including Stephen Fry, Professor Richard Dawkins, Terry Pratchett, Jonathan Miller and Ken Follett), signed an open letter published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; stating their opposition to Pope Benedict XVI being given &quot;the honour of a state visit&quot; to the UK; the letter argued that the Pope had led and condoned global abuses of human rights, leading a state which has &quot;resisted signing many major human rights treaties and has formed its own treaties (&quot;concordats&quot;) with many states which negatively affect the human rights of citizens of those states&quot;.

&quot;New Yorker&quot; journalist Laura Miller described Pullman as one of England&#x27;s most outspoken atheists. He has characterised atheist totalitarian regimes as religions.

Alan Jacobs (of Wheaton College) said that in &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; Pullman replaced the theist world-view of John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; with a Rousseauist one. 

The books in the series have been criticised for their attitude to religion, especially Catholicism, by the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights and Focus on the Family. Writing in the &quot;Catholic Herald&quot; in 1999, Leonie Caldecott cited Pullman&#x27;s work as an example of fiction &quot;far more worthy of the bonfire than Harry [Potter]&quot; on the grounds that &quot;[by] co-opting Catholic terminology and playing with Judaeo-Christian theological concepts, Pullman is effectively removing, among a mass audience of a highly impressionable age, some of the building blocks for future evangelisation&quot;. Pullman was flattered and asked his publisher to include quotes from Caldecott&#x27;s article in his next book. In 2002, the &quot;Catholic Herald&quot; published an article by Sarah Johnson that compared Pullman to a &quot;playground bully&quot; whose work &quot;attacks a religious minority&quot;. The following year, after Benedict Allen&#x27;s reference to the criticism during the BBC TV series &quot;The Big Read&quot;, the &quot;Catholic Herald&quot; republished both articles and Caldecott claimed her &quot;bonfire&quot; comment was a joke and accused Pullman and his supporters of quoting her out of context. In a longer article for &quot;Touchstone&quot; magazine earlier in 2003, Caldecott had also described Pullman&#x27;s work as &quot;axe-grinding&quot; and &quot;a kind of Luciferian enterprise&quot;.

Columnist Peter Hitchens, in a 2002 article for &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;, accused Pullman of &quot;killing god&quot; and described him as &quot;the most dangerous author in Britain&quot; because he said in an interview: &quot;I&#x27;m trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief.&quot; Pullman responded by posting Hitchens&#x27; article on his study wall. In that interview, which was for a February 2001 article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Pullman acknowledged that a controversy would be likely to boost sales, but continued: &quot;I&#x27;m not in the business of offending people. I find the books upholding certain values that I think are important, such as life is immensely valuable and this world is an extraordinarily beautiful place. We should do what we can to increase the amount of wisdom in the world.&quot; Hitchens also views the &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; series as a direct rebuttal of C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;; Pullman has criticised the Narnia books as religious propaganda. Hitchens&#x27; brother Christopher Hitchens, author of &quot;God Is Not Great&quot;, praised &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; as a fresh alternative to Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien and J. K. Rowling, describing the author as one &quot;whose books have begun to dissolve the frontier between adult and juvenile fiction&quot;. However, he was more critical of &quot;The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ&quot;, accusing Pullman of being a &quot;Protestant atheist&quot; for supporting the teachings of Christ but being critical of organised religion.

Pullman has found support from some Christians, most notably Rowan Williams, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, who argued that Pullman&#x27;s attacks focus on the constraints and dangers of dogmatism and the use of religion to oppress, not on Christianity itself. Williams recommended &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; for discussion in religious education classes, and said that &quot;to see large school-parties in the audience of the Pullman plays at the National Theatre is vastly encouraging&quot;. Pullman and Williams took part in a National Theatre platform debate a few days later to discuss myth, religious experience and its representation in the arts.

Donna Freitas, professor of religion at Boston University, argued that challenges to traditional images of God should be welcomed as part of a &quot;lively dialogue about faith&quot;. The Christian writers Kurt Bruner and Jim Ware &quot;also uncover spiritual themes within the books&quot;. Pullman&#x27;s contribution to the &quot;Canongate Myth&quot; series, &quot;The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ&quot;, was described by Mike Collett-White as &quot;a far more direct exploration of the foundations of Christianity and the church as well as an examination of the fascination and power of storytelling&quot;.

In a 2017 interview with &quot;The Times Magazine&quot;, Pullman said: &quot;The place religion has in our lives is a permanent one.&quot; He concluded that there was &quot;no point in condemning [religion]&quot;, and mused that it is part of the human mind to ask philosophical questions such as the purpose of life. He reiterated that it was useless to &quot;become censorious about [religion], to say there is no God&quot;. He also mentioned that his novel, &quot;The Book of Dust&quot;, is based on the &quot;extreme danger of putting power into the hands of those who believe in some absolute creed, whether that is Christianity or Islam or Marxism&quot;.

<text>His Dark Materials is a trilogy of fantasy novels by Philip Pullman consisting of &quot;Northern Lights&quot; (1995; published as &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; in North America), &quot;The Subtle Knife&quot; (1997), and &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot; (2000). It follows the coming of age of two children, Lyra Belacqua and Will Parry, as they wander through a series of parallel universes. The novels have won a number of awards, including the Carnegie Medal in 1995 for &quot;Northern Lights&quot; and the 2001 Whitbread Book of the Year for &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot;. In 2003, the trilogy was ranked third on the BBC&#x27;s The Big Read poll.

Although &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; has been marketed as young adult fiction, and the central characters are children, Pullman wrote with no target audience in mind. The fantasy elements include witches and armoured polar bears; the trilogy also alludes to concepts from physics, philosophy, and theology. It functions in part as a retelling and inversion of John Milton&#x27;s epic &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, with Pullman commending humanity for what Milton saw as its most tragic failing, original sin. The trilogy has attracted controversy for its criticism of religion.

The books have been dramatised several times. BBC Radio 4 produced a three-part full-cast dramatisation in 2003 as did RTE the same year. The London Royal National Theatre staged a two-part adaptation of the trilogy in 2003–2004. New Line Cinema released a film adaptation of &quot;Northern Lights&quot;, &quot;The Golden Compass&quot;, in 2007. A BBC commissioned television series, based on the trilogy and produced by Bad Wolf, was broadcast by both the BBC and HBO between November 2019 and February 2023.

Pullman followed the trilogy with four short works set in the &quot;Northern Lights&quot; universe: &quot;Lyra&#x27;s Oxford&quot;, (2003); &quot;Once Upon a Time in the North&quot;, (2008); &quot;The Collectors&quot; (2014); and the latest &quot;Serpentine&quot;, (2020). A new trilogy, also set in the same universe as &quot;Northern Lights&quot;, titled &quot;The Book of Dust&quot;, with the first novel &quot;La Belle Sauvage&quot; was published on 19 October 2017; the second book, &quot;The Secret Commonwealth&quot;, in October 2019; and in November 2023, Pullman announced that the concluding, as yet untitled, novel would be published in 2024.

==Setting==

The trilogy takes place across a multiverse, moving between many parallel worlds. In &quot;Northern Lights&quot;, the story takes place in a world with some similarities to our own: dress-style resembles that of the UK&#x27;s Edwardian era; the technology does not include cars or fixed-wing aircraft, but zeppelins feature as a mode of transport.

The dominant religion has parallels with Christianity. The Church (governed by the &quot;Magisterium&quot;, the same name as the authority of the Catholic Church) exerts a strong control over society and has some of the appearance and organisation of the Catholic Church, but one in which the centre of power had been moved from Rome to Geneva, moved there by Pullman&#x27;s fictional &quot;Pope John Calvin&quot; (Geneva was the home of the historical John Calvin).

In &quot;The Subtle Knife&quot;, the story moves between our own world, the world of the first novel, and a third world containing the city of Cittàgazze. In &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot;, several other worlds appear alongside those three.

==Titles==

The title of the series comes from 17th-century poet John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;
Into this wilde Abyss,
The Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave,
Of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire,
But all these in their pregnant causes mixt 
Confus&#x27;dly, and which thus must ever fight,
Unless th&#x27; Almighty Maker them ordain
His dark materials to create more Worlds,
Into this wilde Abyss the warie fiend
Stood on the brink of Hell and look&#x27;d a while,
Pondering his Voyage; for no narrow frith
He had to cross.
&lt;/poem&gt;
— &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, Book 2, lines 910–920

Pullman chose this particular phrase from Milton because it echoed the dark matter of astrophysics.

Pullman earlier proposed to name the series &quot;The Golden Compasses&quot;, also a reference to &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, where it denotes the pair of compasses with which God set the bounds of all creation:

&lt;poem&gt;
Then staid the fervid wheels, and in his hand
He took the golden compasses, prepared
In God&#x27;s eternal store, to circumscribe
This universe, and all created things:
One foot he centred, and the other turned
Round through the vast profundity obscure...
&lt;/poem&gt;
— &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, Book 7, lines 224–229
Although Pullman did not intend it as such, the American publishers interpreted this title as a reference to the alethiometer, a compass-like device that features prominently in the books. Pullman eventually settled on the titles &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; for the series and &quot;Northern Lights&quot; for the first book, but the American publishers disliked the latter title and chose to use &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; instead.

== Plot ==
===&quot;Northern Lights&quot; (or &quot;The Golden Compass&quot;)===
In Jordan College, Oxford, 11-year-old Lyra Belacqua and her dæmon Pantalaimon witness the Master attempt to poison Lord Asriel, Lyra&#x27;s rebellious and adventuring uncle. She warns Asriel, then spies on his lecture about Dust, mysterious elementary particles. Lyra&#x27;s friend Roger is kidnapped by child abductors known as Gobblers. Lyra is adopted by a charming socialite, Mrs Coulter. The Master secretly entrusts Lyra with an alethiometer, a truth-telling device. Lyra discovers that Mrs Coulter is the leader of the Gobblers, and that it is a project secretly funded by the Church. Lyra flees to the Gyptians, canal-faring nomads, whose children have also been abducted. They reveal to Lyra that Asriel and Mrs Coulter are actually her parents.

The Gyptians form an expedition to the Arctic with Lyra to rescue the children. Lyra recruits Iorek Byrnison, an armoured bear, and his human aeronaut friend, Lee Scoresby. She also learns that Lord Asriel has been exiled, guarded by the bears on Svalbard.

Near Bolvangar, the Gobbler research station, Lyra finds an abandoned child who has been cut from his dæmon; the Gobblers are experimenting on children by severing the bond between human and dæmon, a procedure called intercision.

Lyra is captured and taken to Bolvangar, where she is reunited with Roger. Mrs Coulter tells Lyra that the intercision prevents the onset of troubling adult emotions. Lyra and the children are rescued by Scoresby, Iorek, the Gyptians, and Serafina Pekkala&#x27;s flying witch clan. Lyra falls out of Scoresby&#x27;s balloon and is taken by the panserbjørne to the castle of their usurping king, Iofur Raknison. She tricks Iofur into fighting Iorek, who arrives with the others to rescue Lyra. Iorek kills Iofur and takes his place as the rightful king.

Lyra, Iorek, and Roger travel to Svalbard, where Asriel has continued his Dust research in exile. He tells Lyra that the Church believes Dust is the basis of sin, and plans to visit the other universes and destroy its source. He severs Roger from his dæmon, killing him and releasing enough energy to create an opening to a parallel universe. Lyra resolves to stop Asriel and discover the source of Dust for herself.

===&quot;The Subtle Knife&quot;===
Lyra journeys through Asriel&#x27;s opening between worlds to Cittàgazze, a city whose denizens discovered a way to travel between worlds. Cittàgazze&#x27;s reckless use of the technology has released Spectres which destroy adult souls but to which children are immune, rendering the world empty of adults. Here Lyra meets and befriends Will Parry, a twelve-year-old boy from our world&#x27;s Oxford. Will, who recently killed a man to protect his ailing mother, has stumbled into Cittàgazze in an effort to locate his long-lost father. Venturing into Will&#x27;s (our) world, Lyra meets Dr. Mary Malone, a physicist who is researching dark matter, which is analogous to Dust in Lyra&#x27;s world. Lyra encourages Dr. Malone to attempt to communicate with the particles, and when she does they tell her to travel into the Cittàgazze world. Lyra&#x27;s alethiometer is stolen by Lord Boreal alias Sir Charles Latrom, an ally of Mrs Coulter who has found a way to Will&#x27;s Oxford and established a home there.

Will becomes the bearer of the Subtle Knife, a tool forged three hundred years before by Cittàgazze&#x27;s scientists from the same alloy used to make the guillotine in Bolvangar. One edge of the knife can divide subatomic particles and form subtle divisions in space, creating portals between worlds; the other edge easily cuts through any form of matter. Using the knife&#x27;s portal-creating powers, Will and Lyra are able to retrieve her alethiometer from Latrom&#x27;s mansion in Will&#x27;s world.

Meanwhile, in Lyra&#x27;s world, Lee Scoresby seeks out the Arctic explorer Stanislaus Grumman, who years before entered Lyra&#x27;s world through a portal in Alaska. Scoresby finds him living as a shaman under the name Jopari and he turns out to be Will&#x27;s father, John Parry. Parry insists on being taken through the opening into the Cittàgazze world in Scoresby&#x27;s balloon, since he has foreseen that he should meet the wielder of the Subtle Knife there. In that world, Scoresby dies defending Parry from the forces of the Church, while Parry succeeds in reuniting with his son moments before being murdered by Juta Kamainen, a witch whose love John had once rejected. After his father&#x27;s death, Will discovers that Lyra has been kidnapped by Mrs Coulter, and he is approached by two angels requesting his aid.

===&quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot;===
At the beginning of &quot;The Amber Spyglass,&quot; Lyra has been kidnapped by her mother, Mrs Coulter, an agent of the Magisterium who has learned of the prophecy identifying Lyra as the next Eve. A pair of angels, Balthamos and Baruch, tell Will that he must travel with them to give the Subtle Knife to Lyra&#x27;s father, Lord Asriel, as a weapon against The Authority. Will ignores the angels; with the help of a local girl named Ama, the Bear King Iorek Byrnison, and Lord Asriel&#x27;s Gallivespian spies, the Chevalier Tialys and the Lady Salmakia, he rescues Lyra from the cave where her mother has hidden her from the Magisterium, which has become determined to kill her before she yields to temptation and sin like the original Eve.

Will, Lyra, Tialys and Salmakia journey to the Land of the Dead, temporarily parting with their dæmons to release the ghosts from their captivity. Mary Malone, a scientist from Will&#x27;s world interested in &quot;shadows&quot; (or Dust in Lyra&#x27;s world), travels to a land populated by strange sentient creatures called Mulefa. There, she comes to understand the true nature of Dust, which is both created by and nourishes life that has become self-aware. Lord Asriel and the reformed Mrs Coulter work to destroy the Authority&#x27;s Regent Metatron. They succeed, but themselves suffer annihilation in the process by pulling Metatron into the abyss.

The Authority himself dies of his own frailty when Will and Lyra free him from the crystal prison wherein Metatron had trapped him, able to do so because an attack by cliff-ghasts kills or drives away the prison&#x27;s protectors. When Will and Lyra emerge from the land of the dead, they find their dæmons.

The book ends with Will and Lyra falling in love but realising they cannot live together in the same world, because all windows – except one from the underworld to the world of the Mulefa – must be closed to prevent the loss of Dust, because with every window opening, a Spectre would be created and that means Will must never use the knife again. They must also be apart because both of them can only live full lives in their native worlds. During the return, Mary Malone learns how to see her own dæmon, who takes the form of a black Alpine chough. Lyra loses her ability to intuitively read the alethiometer and determines to learn how to use her conscious mind to achieve the same effect.

==Characters==

All humans in Lyra&#x27;s world, including witches, have a dæmon. It is the physical manifestation of a person&#x27;s &#x27;inner being&#x27;, soul or spirit. It takes the form of a creature (moth, bird, dog, monkey, snake, etc.) and is usually the opposite sex to its human counterpart. The dæmons of children have the ability to change form - from one creature to another - but during a child&#x27;s puberty, their dæmon &quot;settles&quot; into a permanent form, which reflects the person&#x27;s personality. When a person dies, the dæmon dies too. Armoured bears, cliff ghasts, and other creatures do not have dæmons. An armoured bear&#x27;s armour is his soul.

*Lyra Belacqua, a wild 12-year-old girl, has grown up in the fictional Jordan College, Oxford. She prides herself on her capacity for mischief, especially her ability to lie, earning her the epithet &quot;Silvertongue&quot; from Iorek Byrnison. Lyra has a natural ability to use the alethiometer, which is capable of answering any question when properly manipulated and read.
*Pantalaimon is Lyra&#x27;s dæmon. Like all children&#x27;s dæmons, he changes form from one creature to another frequently. When Lyra reaches puberty, he assumes the permanent form of a pine marten. 
*Will Parry, a sensible, morally conscious, assertive 12-year-old boy from our world. He becomes the bearer of the subtle knife. Will is independent and responsible for his age, having looked after his mentally ill mother for several years. Will&#x27;s dæmon is Kirjava.
*The Authority is the first angel to have emerged from Dust. He told the later-arriving angels that he created them and the universe, but this is a lie. Although he is the overarching antagonist of the series, the Authority remains in the background; he makes his only appearance late in &quot;The Amber Spyglass.&quot; The Authority has grown weak and transferred most of his powers to his regent, Metatron. 
*Lord Asriel, ostensibly Lyra&#x27;s uncle, is actually her father. He opens a rift between the worlds in his pursuit of Dust. His dream of establishing a Republic of Heaven leads him to use his power to raise a grand army from across the multiverse to rise up in rebellion against the forces of the Church.
*Marisa Coulter is the beautiful and manipulative mother of Lyra, and the former lover of Lord Asriel. She serves the Church by kidnapping children for research into the nature of Dust, in the course of which she separates them from their dæmons - a procedure known as intercision. Initially hostile to Lyra, she realises that she loves her daughter and seeks to protect her from agents of the Church who want to kill Lyra. Her dæmon is a golden monkey with a cruel streak.
*Metatron, Asriel&#x27;s principal adversary, was a human, Enoch, in biblical times, but was later transfigured into an angel. The Authority, his health declining, appointed Metatron his Regent. As Regent, Metatron has implanted the monotheistic religions across the universes. 
*Lord Carlo Boreal - or Sir Charles Latrom, CBE, as he is known as in Will Parry&#x27;s world-is a minor character in &quot;Northern Lights&quot;, but the main antagonist in &quot;The Subtle Knife&quot;. He is an old Englishman, appearing to be in his sixties.
*Mary Malone, is a physicist and former nun from Will&#x27;s world. She meets Lyra during Lyra&#x27;s first visit to Will&#x27;s world. Lyra provides Mary with insight into the nature of Dust. Agents of the Church force Mary to flee to the world of the Mulefa. There she constructs the amber spyglass, which enables her to see the otherwise invisible Dust. Her purpose is to learn why Dust, which Mulefa civilisation depends on, is flowing out of the universe. 
*Iorek Byrnison is a massive armoured bear. An armoured bear&#x27;s armour is his soul. Iorek&#x27;s armour is stolen, so he becomes despondent. With Lyra&#x27;s help he regains his armour, his dignity, and his kingship over the armoured bears. In gratitude, and impressed by her cunning, he dubs her &quot;Lyra Silvertongue&quot;. A powerful warrior and blacksmith, Iorek repairs the Subtle Knife when it shatters. He later goes to war against The Authority and Metatron.
*Lee Scoresby, a rangy Texan, is a balloonist. He helps Lyra in an early quest to reach Asriel&#x27;s residence in the North, and he later helps John Parry reunite with his son Will.
*Serafina Pekkala is the beautiful queen of a clan of Northern witches. Her snow-goose dæmon Kaisa, like all witches&#x27; dæmons, can travel much farther apart from her than the dæmons of humans, without feeling the pain of separation.
*The Master of Jordan heads Jordan College, part of Oxford University in Lyra&#x27;s world. Helped by other Jordan College employees, he is raising the supposedly orphaned Lyra. Faced with difficult choices that only later become apparent, he tries unsuccessfully to poison Lord Asriel.
*Roger Parslow is the kitchen boy at Jordan College and Lyra&#x27;s best friend.
*John Parry is Will&#x27;s father. He is an explorer from our world who discovered a portal to Lyra&#x27;s world and became the shaman known as Stanislaus Grumman or Jopari, a variation of his original name.
*The Four Gallivespians—Lord Roke, Madame Oxentiel, Chevalier Tialys, and Lady Salmakia—are tiny people (a hand-span tall) with poisonous heel spurs.
*Ma Costa: A Gyptian woman whose son, Billy Costa, is abducted by the Gobblers. She rescues Lyra from Mrs Coulter and takes her to John Faa. Ma Costa nursed Lyra when she was a baby.
*John Faa: The King of all the Gyptians. He journeys with Lyra to the North with his companion Farder Coram. Faa and Costa rescue Lyra when she runs away from Mrs Coulter. Then they take her to Iorek Byrnison.
*Father Gomez is a priest sent by the Church to assassinate Lyra. 
*Fra Pavel Rašek is an alethiometrist of the Consistorial Court of Discipline, but a sluggish reader of the device.
*Balthamos is a rebel angel who, with his lover Baruch, join in Will&#x27;s journey to find the captured Lyra. Near the end of the story, he saves their lives by killing Father Gomez.
*Mulefa are four-legged wheeled animals; they have one leg in front, one in back, and one on each side. Their &quot;wheels&quot; are large, round, hard seed-pods from trees; an axle-like claw at the end of each leg grips a seed-pod.

== Dæmons ==

One distinctive aspect of Pullman&#x27;s story is the presence of &quot;dæmons&quot; (pronounced &quot;demon&quot;). In the birth-universe of the story&#x27;s protagonist Lyra Belacqua, a human individual&#x27;s inner-self manifests itself throughout life as an animal-shaped &quot;dæmon&quot; that almost always stays near its human counterpart. During the childhood of its associated human, a dæmon can change its animal shape at will, but with the onset of adolescence it settles into a fixed, final animal form.

==Influences==
Pullman has identified three major literary influences on &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;: the essay &quot;On the Marionette Theatre&quot; by Heinrich von Kleist, the works of William Blake, and, most important, John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, from which the trilogy derives its title. In his introduction, he adapts a famous description of Milton by Blake to quip that he (Pullman) &quot;is of the Devil&#x27;s party and &quot;does&quot; know it&quot;.

Critics have compared the trilogy with C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, which Pullman despises, and also with such fantasy books as &quot;Bridge to Terabithia&quot; by Katherine Paterson and &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; by Madeleine L&#x27;Engle.

==Awards and recognition==
The first volume, &quot;Northern Lights&quot;, won the Carnegie Medal for children&#x27;s fiction in the UK in 1995. In 2007, the judges of the CILIP Carnegie Medal for children&#x27;s literature selected it as one of the ten most important children&#x27;s novels of the previous 70 years. In an online June 2007 poll, it was voted the best Carnegie Medal winner in the 70-year history of the award, the Carnegie of Carnegies. &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot; won the 2001 Whitbread Book of the Year award, the first time that such an award has been bestowed on a book from their &quot;children&#x27;s literature&quot; category.

The trilogy came third in the 2003 BBC&#x27;s &quot;Big Read&quot;, a national poll of viewers&#x27; favourite books, after &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.

On 19 May 2005, Pullman attended the British Library in London to receive formal congratulations for his work from culture secretary Tessa Jowell &quot;on behalf of the government&quot;. On 25 May 2005, Pullman received the Swedish government&#x27;s Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award for children&#x27;s and youth literature (sharing it with Japanese illustrator Ryōji Arai). Swedes regard this prize as second only to the Nobel Prize in Literature; it has a value of 5 million Swedish Kronor or approximately £385,000. In 2008, &quot;The Observer&quot; cites &quot;Northern Lights&quot; as one of the 100 best novels. &quot;Time&quot; magazine in the US included &quot;Northern Lights&quot; (&quot;The Golden Compass&quot;) in its list of the 100 Best Young-Adult Books of All Time. In November 2019, the BBC listed &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; on its list of the 100 most influential novels.

==Christian opposition==

&quot;His Dark Materials&quot; has occasioned controversy, primarily among some Christian groups.

Cynthia Grenier, in the &quot;Catholic Culture&quot;, said: &quot;In the world of Pullman, God Himself (the Authority) is a merciless tyrant. His Church is an instrument of oppression, and true heroism consists of overthrowing both&quot;. William A. Donohue of the Catholic League described Pullman&#x27;s trilogy as &quot;atheism for kids&quot;. Pullman said of Donohue&#x27;s call for a boycott, &quot;Why don&#x27;t we trust readers? [...] Oh, it causes me to shake my head with sorrow that such nitwits could be loose in the world&quot;.

In a November 2002 interview, Pullman was asked to respond to the &quot;Catholic Herald&quot; calling his books &quot;the stuff of nightmares&quot; and &quot;worthy of the bonfire&quot;. He replied: &quot;My response to that was to ask the publishers to print it in the next book, which they did! I think it&#x27;s comical, it&#x27;s just laughable&quot;. The original remark in&quot; Catholic Herald &quot;(which was &quot;there are numerous candidates that seem to me to be far more worthy of the bonfire than Harry Potter&quot;) was written in the context of parents in South Carolina pressing their Board of Education to ban the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books.

Pullman expressed surprise over what he considered to be a relatively low level of criticism for &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; on religious grounds, saying &quot;I&#x27;ve been surprised by how little criticism I&#x27;ve got. Harry Potter&#x27;s been taking all the flak... Meanwhile, I&#x27;ve been flying under the radar, saying things that are far more subversive than anything poor old Harry has said. My books are about killing God&quot;. Others support this interpretation, arguing that the series, while clearly anticlerical, is also anti-theological because the death of God is represented as a fundamentally unimportant question.

Pullman found support from some other Christians, most notably from Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury (spiritual head of the Anglican Communion), who argued that Pullman&#x27;s attacks focus on the constraints and dangers of dogmatism and the use of religion to oppress, not on Christianity itself. Williams also recommended the &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; series of books for inclusion and discussion in Religious Education classes, and stated that &quot;To see large school-parties in the audience of the Pullman plays at the National Theatre is vastly encouraging&quot;. Pullman and Williams took part in a National Theatre platform debate a few days later to discuss myth, religious experience, and its representation in the arts.

==Adaptations==
===Radio===
BBC Radio 4 broadcast a radio play adaptation of &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; in 3 episodes, each lasting 2½ hours. The books were adapted and dramatised by Lavinia Murray and directed by both David Hunter and Janet Whitaker, with the music composed by Billy Cowie. It was first broadcast over three consecutive weeks in from 4 January 2003, and then re-broadcast in both 2008-9 and in 2017, and was released by the BBC as box-sets on CD and audio cassette. The streaming rights are held by Audible.

The cast included: 
* Terence Stamp as Lord Asriel
* Emma Fielding as Marisa Coulter
* Lulu Popplewell as Lyra Belacqua
* Daniel Anthony as Will Parry
* Tracy-Ann Oberman as Serafina Pekkala
* Peter Marinker as Lee Scoresby
* Steve Hodson as Iorek Byrnison
* Ray Fearon as the angel Bathalmos who narrates the series.
Both Stamp and Fearon had roles in the subsequent BBC One television adaptation of 2019→2022, with Stamp as the previous elderly bearer of Æsahættr, &quot;the Subtle Knife&quot;, Giacomo Paradisi in Torre degli Angeli of Cittàgazze, and Fearon as Will Parry&#x27;s school boxing coach Mr Hanway.
Also in 2003, an Irish radio dramatisation of &quot;Northern Lights&quot; was made by RTÉ (Raidió Teilifís Éireann).

===Theatre===

Nicholas Hytner directed a theatrical version of the books as a two-part, six-hour performance for London&#x27;s Royal National Theatre in December 2003, running until March 2004. It starred Anna Maxwell-Martin as Lyra, Dominic Cooper as Will, Timothy Dalton as Lord Asriel, Patricia Hodge as Mrs Coulter and Niamh Cusack as Serafina Pekkala, with dæmon puppets designed by Michael Curry. The play was successful and was revived (with a different cast and a revised script) for a second run between November 2004 and April 2005. It has since been staged by several other theatres in the UK and elsewhere.

A new production was staged at Birmingham Repertory Theatre in March and April 2009, directed by Rachel Kavanaugh and Sarah Esdaile and starring Amy McAllister as Lyra. This version toured the UK and included a performance in Pullman&#x27;s hometown of Oxford; Pullman made a cameo appearance.

===Film===

New Line Cinema released a film adaptation, titled &quot;The Golden Compass&quot;, on 7 December 2007. Directed by Chris Weitz, the production had a mixed reception, and though worldwide sales were strong, its U.S. earnings were not as high as the studio had hoped.

The filmmakers obscured the explicitly Biblical character of the Authority to avoid offending viewers. Weitz declared that he would not do the same for the planned sequels. &quot;Whereas &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; had to be introduced to the public carefully&quot;, he said, &quot;the religious themes in the second and third books can&#x27;t be minimised without destroying the spirit of these books. ...I will not be involved with any &#x27;watering down&#x27; of books two and three, since what I have been working towards the whole time in the first film is to be able to deliver on the second and third&quot;.

&quot;The Golden Compass&quot; film stars Dakota Blue Richards as Lyra, Nicole Kidman as Mrs Coulter, and Daniel Craig as Lord Asriel. Eva Green plays Serafina Pekkala, Ian McKellen voices Iorek Byrnison, and Freddie Highmore voices Pantalaimon. While Sam Elliott blamed the Catholic Church&#x27;s opposition for forcing the cancellation of any adaptations of the rest of the trilogy, &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s film critic Stuart Heritage believed disappointing reviews may have been the real reason.

===Television===

In November 2015, the BBC commissioned a television adaptation of &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;. The eight-part adaptation had a planned premiere date in 2017. By July 2018, Dafne Keen had been provisionally cast as Lyra Belacqua, Ruth Wilson as Marisa Coulter, James McAvoy as Lord Asriel, Lin-Manuel Miranda as Lee Scoresby and Clarke Peters as the Master of Jordan College. The series received its premiere in London on 15 October 2019. Broadcast began on BBC One in the United Kingdom and in Ireland on 3 November and on HBO in the United States on 4 November 2019. In 2020 the second series of &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; began streaming on BBC One in the United Kingdom on 8 November and on HBO Max in the United States on 16 November. The third and final eight-episode series premiered first on HBO on 5 December 2022, and on 18 December 2022 in the UK.

<text>&quot;&quot; ( (La Brabançonne); ; ) is the national anthem of Belgium. The originally French title refers to the Duchy of Brabant; the name is usually untranslated in Belgium&#x27;s other two official languages, Dutch and German.

== History ==
According to legend, the Belgian national anthem was written in September 1830, during the Belgian Revolution, by a young revolutionary called &quot;Jenneval&quot;, who read the lyrics during a meeting at the Aigle d&#x27;Or café.

Jenneval, a Frenchman whose real name was Alexandre Dechet (sometimes known as Louis-Alexandre Dechet), wrote the Brabançonne. At the time, he was an actor at the theatre where, in August 1830, the revolution started, which led to independence from the Netherlands. Jenneval died in the war of independence. François van Campenhout composed the accompanying score, based on the tune of a French song called &quot;L&#x27;Air des lanciers polonais&quot; (&quot;the tune of the Polish Lancers&quot;), written by the French poet Eugène de Pradel, whose tune was itself an adaptation of the tune of a song, &quot;L&#x27;Air du magistrat irréprochable&quot;, found in a popular collection of drinking songs called &quot;La Clé du caveau&quot; (The Key to the cellar) and it was first performed in September 1830.

In 1860, Belgium formally adopted the song and music as its national anthem, although the then prime minister, Charles Rogier, edited out lyrics attacking the Dutch House of Orange, inspired by the version written by Louis Hymans.

The Brabançonne is also a monument (1930) by the sculptor Charles Samuel on the Surlet de Chokier square in Brussels. The monument contains partial lyrics of both the French and Dutch versions of the anthem. Like many elements in Belgian folklore, this is mainly based on the French &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; which is also both an anthem and the name of a monument – the sculptural group &quot;Departure of the Volunteers of 1792&quot;, commonly called &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, at the base of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.

== Lyrics ==


=== 1830 original lyrics ===

==== First version (August 1830) ====

==== Second version (September 1830) ====
==== Third version (1860) ====
=== Current version ===
Various committees were charged with reviewing the text and tune of the Brabançonne and establishing an official version. A ministerial circular of the Ministry of the Interior on 8 August 1921 decreed that only the fourth verse of the text by Charles Rogier should be considered official for all three, French, German and in Dutch.


=== Modern short trilingual version ===
In recent years, an unofficial short version of the anthem is sung during Belgian National Day on 21 July each year, combining the words of the anthem in all three of Belgium&#x27;s official languages, similar to the bilingual version of &quot;O Canada&quot;. The lyrics are from the 4th verse of the anthem.

<text>13 (thirteen) is the natural number following 12 and preceding 14.

Folklore surrounding the number 13 appears in many cultures around the world: one theory is that this is due to the cultures employing lunar-solar calendars (there are approximately 12.41 lunations per solar year, and hence 12 &quot;true months&quot; plus a smaller, and often portentous, thirteenth month). This can be witnessed, for example, in the &quot;Twelve Days of Christmas&quot; of Western European tradition.

==In mathematics==
The number 13 is a prime number, happy number and a lucky number. It is a twin prime with 11, as well as a cousin prime with 17. It is the second of only 3 Wilson primes: 5, 13, and 563. A 13-sided regular polygon is called a tridecagon.

=== List of basic calculations ===


==In languages==
===Grammar===

* In all Germanic languages, 13 is the first compound number; the numbers 11 and 12 have their own names.
* The Romance languages use different systems: In Italian, 11 is the first compound number (), as in Romanian (&#x27;), while in Spanish and Portuguese, the numbers up to and including 15 (Spanish , Portuguese &#x27;), and in French and Italian up to and including 16 (French &#x27;, Italian &#x27;) have their own names. This is also the case in most Slavic languages, Hindi-Urdu and other South Asian languages.

==== Folklore ====
In Germany, according to an old tradition, 13 (), as the first compound number, was the first number written in digits; the numbers 0 (&#x27;) through 12 (&#x27;) were spelled out. The &quot;Duden&quot; (the German standard dictionary) now calls this tradition (which was actually never written down as an official rule) outdated and no longer valid, but many writers still follow it.

=== In English ===
Thirteen is one of two numbers within the &quot;teen&quot; numerical range (13–19), along with fifteen, not derived by cardinal numeral (three) and the &quot;teen&quot; suffix; instead, it is derived from the ordinal numeral (third).

==In religion==
=== Islam ===
In Shia, 13 signifies the 13th day of the month of Rajab (the Lunar calendar), which is the birth of Imam Ali.

===Catholicism===
In Catholic devotional practice, the number thirteen is also associated with Saint Anthony of Padua, since his feast day falls on June 13. A traditional devotion called the Thirteen Tuesdays of St. Anthony involves praying to the saint every Tuesday over a period of thirteen weeks. Another devotion, St. Anthony&#x27;s Chaplet, consists of thirteen decades of three beads each.

===Sikhism===
According to famous Sakhi (evidence) or the story of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, when he was an accountant at a town of Sultanpur Lodhi, he was distributing groceries to people. When he gave groceries to the 13th person, he stopped because in Gurmukhi and Hindi the word 13 is called terah, which means yours. And Guru Nanak Dev Ji kept saying, &quot;Yours, yours, yours...&quot; remembering God. People reported to the emperor that Guru Nanak Dev Ji was giving out free food to the people. When treasures were checked, there was more money than before.

===Judaism===
* In Judaism, 13 signifies the age at which a boy matures and becomes a Bar Mitzvah, &quot;i.e.&quot;, a full member of the Jewish faith (counts as a member of Minyan).

===Wicca===
A common tradition in the religion Wicca holds that the number of members for a coven is ideally thirteen, though this tradition is not universal.

== Luck ==
===Bad===
The number 13 is considered an unlucky number in some countries. The end of the Mayan calendar&#x27;s 13th Baktun was superstitiously feared as a harbinger of the apocalyptic 2012 phenomenon. Fear of the number 13 has a specifically recognized phobia, triskaidekaphobia, a word first recorded in 1911. The superstitious sufferers of triskaidekaphobia try to avoid bad luck by keeping away from anything numbered or labelled thirteen. As a result, companies and manufacturers use another way of numbering or labelling to avoid the number, with hotels and tall buildings being conspicuous examples (thirteenth floor). It is also considered unlucky to have thirteen guests at a table. Friday the 13th has been considered an unlucky day.

There are a number of theories as to why the number thirteen became associated with bad luck, but none of them have been accepted as likely.
;The Last Supper: Jesus Christ&#x27;s Last Supper, there were thirteen people around the table, counting Christ and the twelve apostles. Some believe this is unlucky because one of those thirteen, Judas Iscariot, was the betrayer of Jesus Christ. From the 1890s, a number of English language sources relate the &quot;unlucky&quot; thirteen to an idea that at the Last Supper, Judas, the disciple who betrayed Jesus, was the 13th to sit at the table.
;Knights Templar: On Friday, 13 October 1307, King Philip IV of France ordered the arrest of the Knights Templar, and most of the knights were tortured and killed.
;Full moons: A year with 13 full moons instead of 12 posed problems for the monks in charge of the calendars. &quot;This was considered a very unfortunate circumstance, especially by the monks who had charge of the calendar of thirteen months for that year, and it upset the regular arrangement of church festivals. For this reason, thirteen came to be considered an unlucky number.&quot; However, a typical century has about 37 years that have 13 full moons, compared to 63 years with 12 full moons, and typically every third or fourth year has 13 full moons.
;A suppressed lunar cult: In ancient cultures, the number 13 represented femininity, because it corresponded to the number of lunar (menstrual) cycles in a year (). The theory is that, as the solar calendar triumphed over the lunar, the number thirteen became anathema.
;Hammurabi&#x27;s code: There is a myth that the earliest reference to thirteen being unlucky or evil is in the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi (circa 1780 BC), where the thirteenth law is said to be omitted. In fact, the original Code of Hammurabi has no numeration. The translation by L.W. King (1910), edited by Richard Hooker, omitted one article: If the seller have gone to (his) fate (i. e., have died), the purchaser shall recover damages in said case fivefold from the estate of the seller. Other translations of the Code of Hammurabi, for example the translation by Robert Francis Harper, include the 13th article.

===Good===
*France: 13 was traditionally considered a lucky number in France prior to the First World War, and was used in numerical form as a good luck symbol on postcards and charms.
*Italy: 13 was the lucky number in the Italian football pools (&quot;Totocalcio&quot;). The Italian expression (literally, &quot;make thirteen&quot;) means to hit the jackpot.
*United States: Colgate University also considers 13 a lucky number. They were founded in 1819 by 13 men with 13 dollars, 13 prayers and 13 articles. (To this day, members of the Colgate community consider the number 13 a good omen.) In fact, the campus address is 13 Oak Drive in Hamilton, New York, and the male &quot;a cappella&quot; group is called the Colgate 13.

===Other===
A baker&#x27;s dozen, devil&#x27;s dozen, long dozen, or long measure is 13, one more than a standard dozen. The thirteenth loaf is called the vantage loaf because it is considered advantageous overall to get 13 loaves for the price of 12.

In a tarot card deck, XIII is the card of Death, usually picturing the Pale Horse with its rider.

==Age 13==
*In Judaism, thirteen signifies the age at which a boy matures and becomes a Bar Mitzvah, &quot;i.e.&quot;, a full member of the Jewish faith.
*Thirteen is the minimum age of consent in Argentina, Burkina Faso, Niger, and two Mexican states.
*On many social media platforms in the United States, 13 is the standard minimum age to be allowed to create an account in compliance with the Children&#x27;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
*This is the age at which the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) assesses for T-rated games and the Motion Picture Association recommends movies with a PG-13 rating.

== History ==
*The United States of America was created from thirteen British colonies and as such, the number thirteen is a commonly recurring motif in American heraldry. For example, there are thirteen stars on the Great Seal of the United States and there are thirteen stripes on the American flag as well as thirteen rays on the Flag of Arizona.
**The first flag of the United States bore thirteen stripes, alternating red and white, and thirteen white stars in the blue union. The thirteen stripes represented the Thirteen Colonies from which the United States was created, and the thirteen stars represented the number of states in the new nation. When two new states were added to the Union in 1795, the flag bore fifteen stars and fifteen stripes. With the addition of five new states in 1818, the number of stripes was re-set and permanently fixed at thirteen.
**The Great Seal of the United States bears many images of the number thirteen, representing the Thirteen Colonies from which the United States was created. On the Seal&#x27;s obverse, the overhead glory bears thirteen stars. The chest shield in front of the spread eagle bears thirteen stripes (seven white and six red). The eagle&#x27;s right talon holds the Olive Branch of Peace, bearing thirteen olives and thirteen olive leaves. The eagle&#x27;s left talon holds the Weapons of War, consisting of thirteen arrows. The eagle&#x27;s mouth holds a scroll bearing the national motto &quot;E Pluribus Unum&quot; (which, by coincidence, consists of thirteen letters). On the Seal&#x27;s reverse, the unfinished pyramid consists of thirteen levels.

==In sports==

* The number 13 was not used in the Indianapolis 500 from 1915 to 2002. It was not permitted for use between 1926 and 2002. In 2009, E. J. Viso, driving for HVM Racing in the 2009 IndyCar Series season, drove a green number 13 car full-time, despite terrible superstitions about it in motorsports.
* The number 13 was not used in Formula One from 1977 to 2013.
* In rugby league:
** The jersey number 13 is worn by the starting loose forward or lock forward in most competitions. An exception is in the Super League, which uses static squad numbering.
* In rugby union, the jersey number 13 is worn by the outside centre.
* In triathlon, the number 13 is not used. As such, the numbering goes 11, 12, &quot;14&quot;, 15 under the current numbering system.
* In cycle sport events like the Tour de France, riders assigned the number 13 will often wear their race bib upside down.

<text>Fermat&#x27;s principle, also known as the principle of least time, is the link between ray optics and wave optics. Fermat&#x27;s principle states that the path taken by a ray between two given points is the path that can be traveled in the least time.

First proposed by the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat in 1662, as a means of explaining the ordinary law of refraction of light (Fig.1), Fermat&#x27;s principle was initially controversial because it seemed to ascribe knowledge and intent to nature. Not until the 19th century was it understood that nature&#x27;s ability to test alternative paths is merely a fundamental property of waves. If points &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are given, a wavefront expanding from &quot;A&quot; sweeps all possible ray paths radiating from &quot;A&quot;, whether they pass through &quot;B&quot; or not. If the wavefront reaches point &quot;B&quot;, it sweeps not only the &quot;ray&quot; path(s) from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;, but also an infinitude of nearby paths with the same endpoints. Fermat&#x27;s principle describes any ray that happens to reach point &quot;B&quot;; there is no implication that the ray &quot;knew&quot; the quickest path or &quot;intended&quot; to take that path.

In its original &quot;strong&quot; form, Fermat&#x27;s principle states that the path taken by a ray between two given points is the path that can be traveled in the least time. In order to be true in all cases, this statement must be weakened by replacing the &quot;least&quot; time with a time that is &quot;stationary&quot; with respect to variations of the path – so that a deviation in the path causes, at most, a &quot;second-order&quot; change in the traversal time. To put it loosely, a ray path is surrounded by close paths that can be traversed in &quot;very&quot; close times. It can be shown that this technical definition corresponds to more intuitive notions of a ray, such as a line of sight or the path of a narrow beam.

For the purpose of comparing traversal times, the time from one point to the next nominated point is taken as if the first point were a &quot;point-source&quot;. Without this condition, the traversal time would be ambiguous; for example, if the propagation time from to were reckoned from an arbitrary wavefront &quot;W&quot; containing (Fig.2), that time could be made arbitrarily small by suitably angling the wavefront.

Treating a point on the path as a source is the minimum requirement of Huygens&#x27; principle, and is part of the explanation of Fermat&#x27;s principle. But it can also be shown that the geometric &quot;construction&quot; by which Huygens tried to apply his own principle (as distinct from the principle itself) is simply an invocation of Fermat&#x27;s principle. Hence all the conclusions that Huygens drew from that construction – including, without limitation, the laws of rectilinear propagation of light, ordinary reflection, ordinary refraction, and the extraordinary refraction of &quot;Iceland crystal&quot; (calcite) – are also consequences of Fermat&#x27;s principle.

== Derivation ==

=== Sufficient conditions ===

Let us suppose that:
# A disturbance propagates sequentially through a medium (a vacuum or some material, not necessarily homogeneous or isotropic), without action at a distance;
# During propagation, the influence of the disturbance at any intermediate point &quot;P&quot; upon surrounding points has a non-zero angular spread (as if &quot;P&quot; were a source), so that a disturbance originating from any point &quot;A&quot; arrives at any other point &quot;B&quot; via an infinitude of paths, by which &quot;B&quot; receives an infinitude of delayed versions of the disturbance at &quot;A&quot;; and
# These delayed versions of the disturbance will reinforce each other at &quot;B&quot; if they are synchronized within some tolerance.

Then the various propagation paths from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; will help each other, or interfere constructively, if their traversal times agree within the said tolerance. For a small tolerance (in the limiting case), the permissible range of variations of the path is maximized if the path is such that its traversal time is &quot;stationary&quot; with respect to the variations, so that a variation of the path causes at most a &quot;second-order&quot; change in the traversal time.

The most obvious example of a stationarity in traversal time is a (local or global) minimum – that is, a path of &quot;least&quot; time, as in the &quot;strong&quot; form of Fermat&#x27;s principle. But that condition is not essential to the argument.

Having established that a path of stationary traversal time is reinforced by a maximally wide corridor of neighboring paths, we still need to explain how this reinforcement corresponds to intuitive notions of a ray. But, for brevity in the explanations, let us first &quot;define&quot; a ray path as a path of stationary traversal time.

=== A ray as a signal path (line of sight) ===

If the corridor of paths reinforcing a ray path from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; is substantially obstructed, this will significantly alter the disturbance reaching &quot;B&quot; from &quot;A&quot; – unlike a similar-sized obstruction &quot;outside&quot; any such corridor, blocking paths that do not reinforce each other. The former obstruction will significantly disrupt the signal reaching &quot;B&quot; from &quot;A&quot;, while the latter will not; thus the ray path marks a &quot;signal&quot; path. If the signal is visible light, the former obstruction will significantly affect the appearance of an object at &quot;A&quot; as seen by an observer at &quot;B&quot;, while the latter will not; so the ray path marks a &quot;line of sight&quot;.

In optical experiments, a line of sight is routinely assumed to be a ray path.

=== A ray as an energy path (beam) ===

If the corridor of paths reinforcing a ray path from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; is substantially obstructed, this will significantly affect the &quot;energy&quot; reaching &quot;B&quot; from &quot;A&quot; – unlike a similar-sized obstruction outside any such corridor. Thus the ray path marks an &quot;energy&quot; path – as does a beam.

Suppose that a wavefront expanding from point &quot;A&quot; passes point &quot;P&quot;, which lies on a ray path from point &quot;A&quot; to point &quot;B&quot;. By definition, all points on the wavefront have the same propagation time from &quot;A&quot;. Now let the wavefront be blocked except for a window, centered on &quot;P&quot;, and small enough to lie within the corridor of paths that reinforce the ray path from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;. Then all points on the unobstructed portion of the wavefront will have, nearly enough, equal propagation times to &quot;B&quot;, but &quot;not&quot; to points in other directions, so that &quot;B&quot; will be in the direction of peak intensity of the beam admitted through the window. So the ray path marks the beam. And in optical experiments, a beam is routinely considered as a collection of rays or (if it is narrow) as an approximation to a ray (Fig.3).

=== Analogies ===

According to the &quot;strong&quot; form of Fermat&#x27;s principle, the problem of finding the path of a light ray from point &quot;A&quot; in a medium of faster propagation, to point &quot;B&quot; in a medium of slower propagation (Fig.1), is analogous to the problem faced by a lifeguard in deciding where to enter the water in order to reach a drowning swimmer as soon as possible, given that the lifeguard can run faster than (s)he can swim. But that analogy falls short of &quot;explaining&quot; the behavior of the light, because the lifeguard can think about the problem (even if only for an instant) whereas the light presumably cannot. The discovery that ants are capable of similar calculations does not bridge the gap between the animate and the inanimate.

In contrast, the above assumptions (1) to (3) hold for any wavelike disturbance and explain Fermat&#x27;s principle in purely mechanistic terms, without any imputation of knowledge or purpose.

The principle applies to waves in general, including (e.g.) sound waves in fluids and elastic waves in solids. In a modified form, it even works for matter waves: in quantum mechanics, the classical path of a particle is obtainable by applying Fermat&#x27;s principle to the associated wave – except that, because the frequency may vary with the path, the stationarity is in the phase shift (or number of cycles) and not necessarily in the time.

Fermat&#x27;s principle is most familiar, however, in the case of visible light: it is the link between geometrical optics, which describes certain optical phenomena in terms of &quot;rays&quot;, and the wave theory of light, which explains the same phenomena on the hypothesis that light consists of &quot;waves&quot;.

== Equivalence to Huygens&#x27; construction ==


In this article we distinguish between Huygens&#x27; &quot;principle&quot;, which states that every point crossed by a traveling wave becomes the source of a secondary wave, and Huygens&#x27; &quot;construction&quot;, which is described below.

Let the surface be a wavefront at time , and let the surface be the same wavefront at the later time (Fig.4). Let be a general point on . Then, according to Huygens&#x27; construction,

The construction may be repeated in order to find successive positions of the primary wavefront, and successive points on the ray.

The ray direction given by this construction is the radial direction of the secondary wavefront, and may differ from the normal of the secondary wavefront (cf. Fig.2), and therefore from the normal of the primary wavefront at the point of tangency. Hence the ray &quot;velocity&quot;, in magnitude and direction, is the radial velocity of an infinitesimal secondary wavefront, and is generally a function of location and direction.

Now let be a point on close to , and let be a point on close to . Then, by the construction,

By (i), the ray path is a path of stationary traversal time from to ; and by (ii), it is a path of stationary traversal time from a point on to .

So Huygens&#x27; construction implicitly defines a ray path as &quot;a path of stationary traversal time between successive positions of a wavefront&quot;, the time being reckoned from a &quot;point-source&quot; on the earlier wavefront. This conclusion remains valid if the secondary wavefronts are reflected or refracted by surfaces of discontinuity in the properties of the medium, provided that the comparison is restricted to the affected paths and the affected portions of the wavefronts.

Fermat&#x27;s principle, however, is conventionally expressed in &quot;point-to-point&quot; terms, not wavefront-to-wavefront terms. Accordingly, let us modify the example by supposing that the wavefront which becomes surface at time , and which becomes surface at the later time , is emitted from point at time . Let be a point on (as before), and a point on . And let , , , and be given, so that the problem is to find .

If satisfies Huygens&#x27; construction, so that the secondary wavefront from is tangential to at , then is a path of stationary traversal time from to . Adding the fixed time from to , we find that is the path of stationary traversal time from to (possibly with a restricted domain of comparison, as noted above), in accordance with Fermat&#x27;s principle. The argument works just as well in the converse direction, provided that has a well-defined tangent plane at . Thus Huygens&#x27; construction and Fermat&#x27;s principle are geometrically equivalent.

Through this equivalence, Fermat&#x27;s principle sustains Huygens&#x27; construction and thence all the conclusions that Huygens was able to draw from that construction. In short, &quot;The laws of geometrical optics may be derived from Fermat&#x27;s principle&quot;. With the exception of the Fermat–Huygens principle itself, these laws are special cases in the sense that they depend on further assumptions about the media. Two of them are mentioned under the next heading.

== Special cases ==

=== Isotropic media: rays normal to wavefronts ===

In an isotropic medium, because the propagation speed is independent of direction, the secondary wavefronts that expand from points on a primary wavefront in a given &quot;infinitesimal&quot; time are spherical, so that their radii are normal to their common tangent surface at the points of tangency. But their radii mark the ray directions, and their common tangent surface is a general wavefront. Thus the rays are normal (orthogonal) to the wavefronts.

Because much of the teaching of optics concentrates on isotropic media, treating anisotropic media as an optional topic, the assumption that the rays are normal to the wavefronts can become so pervasive that even Fermat&#x27;s principle is explained under that assumption, although in fact Fermat&#x27;s principle is more general.

=== Homogeneous media: rectilinear propagation ===

In a homogeneous medium (also called a &quot;uniform&quot; medium), all the secondary wavefronts that expand from a given primary wavefront in a given time are congruent and similarly oriented, so that their envelope may be considered as the envelope of a &quot;single&quot; secondary wavefront which preserves its orientation while its center (source) moves over . If is its center while is its point of tangency with , then moves parallel to , so that the plane tangential to at is parallel to the plane tangential to at . Let another (congruent and similarly orientated) secondary wavefront be centered on , moving with , and let it meet its envelope at point . Then, by the same reasoning, the plane tangential to at is parallel to the other two planes. Hence, due to the congruence and similar orientations, the ray directions and are the same (but not necessarily normal to the wavefronts, since the secondary wavefronts are not necessarily spherical). This construction can be repeated any number of times, giving a straight ray of any length. Thus a homogeneous medium admits rectilinear rays.

== Modern version ==

=== Formulation in terms of refractive index ===

Let a path extend from point to point . Let be the arc length measured along the path from , and let be the time taken to traverse that arc length at the ray speed formula_1 (that is, at the radial speed of the local secondary wavefront, for each location and direction on the path). Then the traversal time of the entire path is
\,}&lt;/math&gt;|1}}
(where and simply denote the endpoints and are not to be construed as values of or ). The condition for to be a &quot;ray&quot; path is that the first-order change in due to a change in is zero; that is,
formula_2

Now let us define the &quot;optical length&quot; of a given path (&quot;optical path length&quot;, &quot;OPL&quot;) as the distance traversed by a ray in a homogeneous isotropic reference medium (e.g., a vacuum) in the same time that it takes to traverse the given path at the local ray velocity. Then, if denotes the propagation speed in the reference medium (e.g., the speed of light in vacuum), the optical length of a path traversed in time is , and the optical length of a path traversed in time is . So, multiplying equation (1) through by , we obtain
formula_3
where formula_4 is the &quot;ray index&quot; – that is, the refractive index calculated on the &quot;ray&quot; velocity instead of the usual phase velocity (wave-normal velocity). For an infinitesimal path, we have formula_5 indicating that the optical length is the physical length multiplied by the ray index: the OPL is a notional &quot;geometric&quot; quantity, from which time has been factored out. In terms of OPL, the condition for to be a ray path (Fermat&#x27;s principle) becomes
\,ds = 0.&lt;/math&gt;|2}}
This has the form of Maupertuis&#x27;s principle in classical mechanics (for a single particle), with the ray index in optics taking the role of momentum or velocity in mechanics.

In an isotropic medium, for which the ray velocity is also the phase velocity, we may substitute the usual refractive index for .

=== Relation to Hamilton&#x27;s principle ===

If , , are Cartesian coordinates and an overdot denotes differentiation with respect to , Fermat&#x27;s principle (2) may be written
formula_6
In the case of an isotropic medium, we may replace with the normal refractive index , which is simply a scalar field. If we then define the &quot;optical Lagrangian&quot; as
formula_7
Fermat&#x27;s principle becomes
formula_8
If the direction of propagation is always such that we can use instead of as the parameter of the path (and the overdot to denote differentiation w.r.t.  instead of ), the optical Lagrangian can instead be written
formula_9
so that Fermat&#x27;s principle becomes
formula_10
This has the form of Hamilton&#x27;s principle in classical mechanics, except that the time dimension is missing: the third spatial coordinate in optics takes the role of time in mechanics. The optical Lagrangian is the function which, when integrated w.r.t. the parameter of the path, yields the OPL; it is the foundation of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian optics.

== History ==

If a ray follows a straight line, it obviously takes the path of least &quot;length&quot;. Hero of Alexandria, in his &quot;Catoptrics&quot; (1st century CE), showed that the ordinary law of reflection off a plane surface follows from the premise that the total &quot;length&quot; of the ray path is a minimum. Ibn al-Haytham, an 11th-century polymath later extended this principle to refraction, hence giving an early version of the Fermat&#x27;s principle.

=== Fermat vs. the Cartesians ===
In 1657, Pierre de Fermat received from Marin Cureau de la Chambre a copy of newly published treatise, in which La Chambre noted Hero&#x27;s principle and complained that it did not work for refraction.

Fermat replied that refraction might be brought into the same framework by supposing that light took the path of least &quot;resistance&quot;, and that different media offered different resistances. His eventual solution, described in a letter to La Chambre dated 1 January 1662, construed &quot;resistance&quot; as inversely proportional to speed, so that light took the path of least &quot;time&quot;. That premise yielded the ordinary law of refraction, provided that light traveled more slowly in the optically denser medium.

Fermat&#x27;s solution was a landmark in that it unified the then-known laws of geometrical optics under a &quot;variational principle&quot; or &quot;action principle&quot;, setting the precedent for the principle of least action in classical mechanics and the corresponding principles in other fields (see &quot;History of variational principles in physics&quot;). It was the more notable because it used the method of &quot;adequality&quot;, which may be understood in retrospect as finding the point where the slope of an infinitesimally short chord is zero, without the intermediate step of finding a general expression for the slope (the derivative).

It was also immediately controversial. The ordinary law of refraction was at that time attributed to René Descartes (d.1650), who had tried to explain it by supposing that light was a force that propagated &quot;instantaneously&quot;, or that light was analogous to a tennis ball that traveled &quot;faster&quot; in the denser medium, either premise being inconsistent with Fermat&#x27;s.  Descartes&#x27; most prominent defender, Claude Clerselier, criticized Fermat for apparently ascribing knowledge and intent to nature, and for failing to explain why nature should prefer to economize on time rather than distance. Clerselier wrote in part:

1. The principle that you take as the basis of your demonstration, namely that nature always acts in the shortest and simplest ways, is merely a moral principle and not a physical one; it is not, and cannot be, the cause of any effect in nature ... For otherwise we would attribute knowledge to nature; but here, by &quot;nature&quot;, we understand only this order and this law established in the world as it is, which acts without foresight, without choice, and by a necessary determination.

2. This same principle would make nature irresolute ... For I ask you ... when a ray of light must pass from a point in a rare medium to a point in a dense one, is there not reason for nature to hesitate if, by your principle, it must choose the straight line as soon as the bent one, since if the latter proves shorter in time, the former is shorter and simpler in length? Who will decide and who will pronounce?
Fermat, being unaware of the mechanistic foundations of his own principle, was not well placed to defend it, except as a purely geometric and kinematic proposition.  The wave theory of light, first proposed by Robert Hooke in the year of Fermat&#x27;s death, and rapidly improved by Ignace-Gaston Pardies and (especially) Christiaan Huygens, contained the necessary foundations; but the recognition of this fact was surprisingly slow.

=== Huygens&#x27;s oversight ===

In 1678, Huygens proposed that every point reached by a luminous disturbance becomes a source of a spherical wave; the sum of these secondary waves determines the form of the wave at any subsequent time. Huygens repeatedly referred to the envelope of his secondary wavefronts as the &quot;termination&quot; of the movement, meaning that the later wavefront was the outer boundary that the disturbance could reach in a given time, which was therefore the minimum time in which each point on the later wavefront could be reached. But he did not argue that the &quot;direction&quot; of minimum time was that from the secondary source to the point of tangency; instead, he deduced the ray direction from the extent of the common tangent surface corresponding to a given extent of the initial wavefront. His only endorsement of Fermat&#x27;s principle was limited in scope: having derived the law of ordinary refraction, for which the rays are normal to the wavefronts, Huygens gave a geometric proof that a ray refracted according to this law takes the path of least time. He would hardly have thought this necessary if he had known that the principle of least time followed &quot;directly&quot; from the same common-tangent construction by which he had deduced not only the law of ordinary refraction, but also the laws of rectilinear propagation and ordinary reflection (which were also known to follow from Fermat&#x27;s principle), and a previously unknown law of extraordinary refraction – the last by means of secondary wavefronts that were spheroidal rather than spherical, with the result that the rays were generally oblique to the wavefronts. It was as if Huygens had not noticed that his construction implied Fermat&#x27;s principle, and even as if he thought he had found an exception to that principle. Manuscript evidence cited by Alan E.Shapiro tends to confirm that Huygens believed the principle of least time to be invalid &quot;in double refraction, where the rays are not normal to the wave fronts&quot;.

Shapiro further reports that the only three authorities who accepted &quot;Huygens&#x27; principle&quot; in the 17th and 18th centuries, namely Philippe de La Hire, Denis Papin, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, did so because it accounted for the extraordinary refraction of &quot;Iceland crystal&quot; (calcite) in the same manner as the previously known laws of geometrical optics. But, for the time being, the corresponding extension of Fermat&#x27;s principle went unnoticed.

=== Laplace, Young, Fresnel, and Lorentz ===

On 30 January 1809, Pierre-Simon Laplace, reporting on the work of his protégé Étienne-Louis Malus, claimed that the extraordinary refraction of calcite could be explained under the corpuscular theory of light with the aid of Maupertuis&#x27;s principle of least action: that the integral of speed with respect to distance was a minimum. The corpuscular speed that satisfied this principle was proportional to the reciprocal of the ray speed given by the radius of Huygens&#x27; spheroid. Laplace continued:

According to Huygens, the velocity of the extraordinary ray, in the crystal, is simply expressed by the radius of the spheroid; consequently his hypothesis &quot;does not agree&quot; with the principle of the least action: but &quot;it is remarkable&quot; that it agrees with the principle of Fermat, which is, that light passes, from a given point without the crystal, to a given point within it, in the least possible time; for it is easy to see that this principle coincides with that of the least action, if we invert the expression of the velocity.


Laplace&#x27;s report was the subject of a wide-ranging rebuttal by Thomas Young, who wrote in part:

The principle of Fermat, although it was assumed by that mathematician on hypothetical, or even imaginary grounds, is in fact a fundamental law with respect to undulatory motion, and is the basis of every determination in the Huygenian theory...  Mr. Laplace seems to be unacquainted with this most essential principle of one of the two theories which he compares; for he says, that &quot;it is remarkable&quot; that the Huygenian law of extraordinary refraction agrees with the principle of Fermat; which he would scarcely have observed, if he had been aware that the law was an immediate consequence of the principle.

In fact Laplace &quot;was&quot; aware that Fermat&#x27;s principle follows from Huygens&#x27; construction in the case of refraction from an isotropic medium to an anisotropic one; a geometric proof was contained in the long version of Laplace&#x27;s report, printed in 1810.

Young&#x27;s claim was more general than Laplace&#x27;s, and likewise upheld Fermat&#x27;s principle even in the case of extraordinary refraction, in which the rays are generally &quot;not perpendicular&quot; to the wavefronts. Unfortunately, however, the omitted middle sentence of the quoted paragraph by Young began &quot;The motion of every undulation must necessarily be in a direction &quot;perpendicular&quot; to its surface ...&quot; (emphasis added), and was therefore bound to sow confusion rather than clarity.

No such confusion subsists in Augustin-Jean Fresnel&#x27;s &quot;Second Memoir&quot; on double refraction (Fresnel, 1827), which addresses Fermat&#x27;s principle in several places (without naming Fermat), proceeding from the special case in which rays are normal to wavefronts, to the general case in which rays are paths of least time or stationary time. (In the following summary, page numbers refer to Alfred W.Hobson&#x27;s translation.)
* For refraction of a plane wave at parallel incidence on one face of an anisotropic crystalline wedge (pp.291–2), in order to find the &quot;first ray arrived&quot; at an observation point beyond the other face of the wedge, it suffices to treat the rays outside the crystal as normal to the wavefronts, and within the crystal to consider only the parallel wavefronts (whatever the ray direction). So in this case, Fresnel does not attempt to trace the complete ray path.
* Next, Fresnel considers a ray refracted from a point-source &quot;M&quot; inside a crystal, through a point &quot;A&quot; on the surface, to an observation point &quot;B&quot; outside (pp.294–6). The surface passing through &quot;B&quot; and given by the &quot;locus of the disturbances which arrive first&quot; is, according to Huygens&#x27; construction, normal to &quot;the ray &quot;AB&quot; of swiftest arrival&quot;. But this construction requires knowledge of the &quot;surface of the wave&quot; (that is, the secondary wavefront) within the crystal.
* Then he considers a plane wavefront propagating in a medium with non-spherical secondary wavefronts, oriented so that the ray path given by Huygens&#x27; construction – from the source of the secondary wavefront to its point of tangency with the subsequent primary wavefront – is &quot;not&quot; normal to the primary wavefronts (p.296). He shows that this path is nevertheless &quot;the path of quickest arrival of the disturbance&quot; from the earlier primary wavefront to the point of tangency.
* In a later heading (p.305) he declares that &quot;The construction of Huygens, which determines the path of swiftest arrival&quot; is applicable to secondary wavefronts of any shape. He then notes that when we apply Huygens&#x27; construction to refraction into a crystal with a two-sheeted secondary wavefront, and draw the lines from the two points of tangency to the center of the secondary wavefront, &quot;we shall have the directions of the two paths of swiftest arrival, and consequently of the ordinary and of the extraordinary ray.&quot;
* Under the heading &quot;Definition of the word &quot;Ray&quot;&quot; (p.309), he concludes that this term must be applied to the line which joins the center of the secondary wave to a point on its surface, whatever the inclination of this line to the surface.
* As a &quot;new consideration&quot; (pp.310–11), he notes that if a plane wavefront is passed through a small hole centered on point &quot;E&quot;, then the direction &quot;ED&quot; of maximum intensity of the resulting beam will be that in which the secondary wave starting from &quot;E&quot; will &quot;arrive there the first&quot;, and the secondary wavefronts from opposite sides of the hole (equidistant from &quot;E&quot;) will &quot;arrive at &quot;D&quot; in the same time&quot; as each other. This direction is &quot;not&quot; assumed to be normal to any wavefront.
Thus Fresnel showed, even for anisotropic media, that the ray path given by Huygens&#x27; construction is the path of least time between successive positions of a plane or diverging wavefront, that the ray velocities are the radii of the secondary &quot;wave surface&quot; after unit time, and that a stationary traversal time accounts for the direction of maximum intensity of a beam. However, establishing the general equivalence between Huygens&#x27; construction and Fermat&#x27;s principle would have required further consideration of Fermat&#x27;s principle in point-to-point terms.

Hendrik Lorentz, in a paper written in 1886 and republished in 1907, deduced the principle of least time in point-to-point form from Huygens&#x27; construction. But the essence of his argument was somewhat obscured by an apparent dependence on aether and aether drag.

Lorentz&#x27;s work was cited in 1959 by Adriaan J. de Witte, who then offered his own argument, which &quot;although in essence the same, is believed to be more cogent and more general&quot;. De Witte&#x27;s treatment is more original than that description might suggest, although limited to two dimensions; it uses calculus of variations to show that Huygens&#x27; construction and Fermat&#x27;s principle lead to the same differential equation for the ray path, and that in the case of Fermat&#x27;s principle, the converse holds. De Witte also noted that &quot;The matter seems to have escaped treatment in textbooks.&quot;

== In popular culture ==
The short story &quot;Story of Your Life&quot; by the speculative fiction writer Ted Chiang contains visual depictions of Fermat&#x27;s Principle along with a discussion of its teleological dimension. Keith Devlin&#x27;s &quot;The Math Instinct&quot; contains a chapter, &quot;Elvis the Welsh Corgi Who Can Do Calculus&quot; that discusses the calculus &quot;embedded&quot; in some animals as they solve the &quot;least time&quot; problem in actual situations.

<text>A society () is a group of individuals involved in persistent social interaction or a large social group sharing the same spatial or social territory, typically subject to the same political authority and dominant cultural expectations. Societies are characterized by patterns of relationships (social relations) between individuals who share a distinctive culture and institutions; a given society may be described as the sum total of such relationships among its constituent members.

Human social structures are complex and highly cooperative, featuring the specialization of labor via social roles. Societies construct roles and other patterns of behavior by deeming certain actions or concepts acceptable or unacceptable—these expectations around behavior within a given society are known as societal norms. So far as it is collaborative, a society can enable its members to benefit in ways that would otherwise be difficult on an individual basis.

Societies vary based on level of technology and type of economic activity. Larger societies with larger food surpluses often exhibit stratification or dominance patterns. Societies can have many different forms of government, various ways of understanding kinship, and different gender roles. Human behavior varies immensely between different societies; humans shape society, but society in turn shapes human beings.

== Etymology and usage ==
The term &quot;society&quot; often refers to a large group of people in an ordered community, in a country or several similar countries, or the &#x27;state of being with other people&#x27;, e.g. &quot;they lived in medieval society.&quot;
The term dates back to at least 1513 and comes from the 12th-century French (modern French ) meaning &#x27;company&#x27;. was in turn derived from the Latin word (&#x27;fellowship,&#x27; &#x27;alliance&#x27;, &#x27;association&#x27;), which in turn was derived from the noun (&quot;comrade, friend, ally&quot;).

== Conceptions ==
=== In biology ===
Humans, along with their closest relatives bonobos and chimpanzees, are highly social animals. This biological context suggests that the underlying sociability required for the formation of societies is hardwired into human nature. Human society features high degrees of cooperation, and differs in important ways from groups of chimps and bonobos, including the parental role of males, the use of language to communicate, the specialization of labor, and the tendency to build &quot;nests&quot; (multigenerational camps, town, or cities).

Some biologists, including entomologist E.O. Wilson, categorize humans as eusocial, placing humans with ants in the highest level of sociability on the spectrum of animal ethology, although others disagree. Social group living may have evolved in humans due to group selection in physical environments that made survival difficult.

=== In sociology ===

In Western sociology, there are three dominant paradigms for understanding society: functionalism (also known as structural functionalism), conflict theory, and symbolic interactionism.

==== Functionalism ====
According to the functionalist school of thought, individuals in society work together like organs in the body to create emergent behavior, sometimes referred to as collective consciousness. 19th century sociologists Auguste Comte and Émile Durkheim, for example, believed that society constitutes a separate &quot;level&quot; of reality, distinct from both biological and inorganic matter. Explanations of social phenomena had therefore to be constructed within this level, individuals being merely transient occupants of comparatively stable social roles.

==== Conflict theory ====
Conflict theorists take the opposite view, and posit that individuals and social groups or social classes within society interact on the basis of conflict rather than agreement. One prominent conflict theorist is Karl Marx who conceived of society as operating on an economic &quot;base&quot; with a &quot;superstructure&quot; of government, family, religion and culture. Marx argues that the economic base determines the superstructure, and that throughout history, societal change has been driven by conflict between laborers and those who own the means of production.

==== Symbolic interactionism ====
Symbolic interactionism is a microsociological theory that focuses on individuals and how the individual relates to society. Symbolic interactionists study humans&#x27; use of shared language to create common symbols and meanings, and use this frame of reference to understand how individuals interact to create symbolic worlds, and in turn, how these worlds shape individual behaviors.

In the latter half of the 20th century, theorists began to view society as socially constructed. In this vein, sociologist Peter L. Berger describes society as &quot;dialectic&quot;: Society is created by humans, but this creation turns in turn creates or molds humans.

==== Non-Western views ====

The sociologic emphasis placed on functionalism, conflict theory, and symbolic interactionism, has been criticized as Eurocentric. The Malaysian sociologist Syed Farid al-Attas, for example, argues that Western thinkers are particularly interested in the implications of modernity, and that their analysis of non-Western cultures is therefore limited in scope. As examples of nonwestern thinkers who took a systematic approach to understanding society, al-Attas mentions Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406) and José Rizal (1861–1896).

Khaldun, an Arab living in the 14th century, understood society, along with the rest of the universe, as having &quot;meaningful configuration&quot;, with its perceived randomness attributable to hidden causes. Khaldun conceptualized social structures as having two fundamental forms: nomadic and sedentary. Nomadic life has high social cohesion (&quot;asabijja&quot;), which Khaldun argued arose from kinship, shared customs, and a shared need for defense. Sedentary life, in Khaldun&#x27;s view, was marked by secularization, decreased social cohesion, and increased interest in luxury. Rizal was a Filipino nationalist living toward the end of the Spanish Colonial Period who theorized about colonial societies. Rizal argued that indolence, which the Spanish used to justify their colonial occupation, was instead caused by the colonial occupation. Rizal compared the pre-colonial era, when the Filipinos controlled trade routes and had higher economic activity, to the period of colonial rule, and argued that exploitation, economic disorder, and colonial policies that discouraged farming led to a decreased interest in work.

==Types==
Sociologists tend to classify societies based on their level of technology, and place societies in three broad categories: pre-industrial, industrial, and postindustrial.

Subdivisions of these categories vary, and classifications are often based on level of technology, communication, and economy. One example of such a classification comes from sociologist Gerhard Lenski who lists: (1) hunting and gathering; (2) horticultural; (3) agricultural; and (4) industrial; as well as specialized societies (e.g., fishing or herding).

Some cultures have developed over time toward more complex forms of organization and control. This cultural evolution has a profound effect on patterns of community. Hunter-gatherer tribes have, at times, settled around seasonal food stocks to become agrarian villages. Villages have grown to become towns and cities. Cities have turned into city-states and nation-states. However, these processes are not unidirectional.

===Pre-industrial===

In a pre-industrial society, food production, which is carried out through the use of human and animal labor, is the main economic activity. These societies can be subdivided according to their level of technology and their method of producing food. These subdivisions are hunting and gathering, pastoral, horticultural, and agrarian.

==== Hunting and gathering ====
The main form of food production in hunter-gatherer societies is the daily collection of wild plants and the hunting of wild animals. Hunter-gatherers move around constantly in search of food. As a result, they do not build permanent villages or create a wide variety of artifacts. The need for mobility also limits the size of these societies, and they usually only form small groups such as bands and tribes, usually with fewer than 50 people per community. Bands and tribes are relatively egalitarian, and decisions are reached through consensus. There are no formal political offices containing real power in band societies, rather a chief is merely a person of influence, and leadership is based on personal qualities. The family forms the main social unit, with most members being related by birth or marriage.

The anthropologist Marshall Sahlins described hunter-gatherers as the &quot;original affluent society&quot; due to their extended leisure time: Sahlins estimated that adults in hunter gatherer societies work three to five hours per day. This perspective has been challenged by other researchers, who have pointed out high mortality rates and perennial warfare in hunter-gatherer societies. Proponents of Sahlins&#x27; view argue that the general well-being of humans in hunter gatherer societies challenges the purported relationship between technological advancement and human progress.

==== Pastoral ====
Rather than searching for food on a daily basis, members of a pastoral society rely on domesticated herd animals to meet their food needs. Pastoralists typically live a nomadic life, moving their herds from one pasture to another. Community size in pastoral societies is similar to hunter-gatherers (about 50 individuals), but unlike hunter gatherers, pastoral societies usually consist of multiple communities—the average pastoral society contains thousands of people. This is because pastoral groups tend to live in open areas where movement is easy, which enables political integration. Pastoral societies tend to create a food surplus, and have specialized labor and high levels of inequality.

==== Horticultural ====

Fruits and vegetables grown in garden plots, that have been cleared from the jungle or forest, provide the main source of food in a horticultural society. These societies have a similar level of technology and complexity to pastoral societies. Along with pastoral societies, horticultural societies emerged about 10,000 years ago, after technological changes of the Agricultural Revolution made it possible to cultivate crops and raise animals. Horticulturists use human labor and simple tools to cultivate the land for one or more seasons. When the land becomes barren, horticulturists clear a new plot and leave the old plot to revert to its natural state. They may return to the original land several years later and begin the process again. By rotating their garden plots, horticulturists can stay in one area for a long period of time. This allows them to build permanent or semi-permanent villages.

As with pastoral societies, surplus food leads to a more complex division of labor. Specialized roles in horticultural societies include craftspeople, shamans (religious leaders), and traders. This role specialization allows horticultural societies to create a variety of artifacts. Scarce, defensible resources can lead to wealth inequalities in horticultural political systems.

==== Agrarian ====
Agrarian societies use agricultural technological advances to cultivate crops over a large area. Lenski differentiates between horticultural and agrarian societies by the use of the plow. Larger food supplies due to improved technology mean agrarian communities are larger than horticultural communities. A greater food surplus results in towns that become centers of trade. Economic trade in turn leads to increased specialization, including a ruling class, as well as educators, craftspeople, merchants, and religious figures, who do not directly participate in the production of food.

Agrarian societies are especially noted for their extremes of social classes and rigid social mobility. As land is the major source of wealth, social hierarchy develops based on landownership and not labor. The system of stratification is characterized by three coinciding contrasts: governing class versus the masses, urban minority versus peasant majority, and literate minority versus illiterate majority. This results in two distinct subcultures; the urban elite versus the peasant masses. Moreover, this means cultural differences within agrarian societies are greater than differences between them.

The landowning strata typically combine government, religious, and military institutions to justify and enforce their ownership, and support elaborate patterns of consumption, slavery, serfdom, or peonage is commonly the lot of the primary producer. Rulers of agrarian societies often do not manage their empire for the common good or in the name of the public interest, but as property they own. Caste systems, as historically found in South Asia, are associated with agrarian societies, where lifelong agricultural routines depend upon a rigid sense of duty and discipline. The scholar Donald Brown suggests that an emphasis in the modern West on personal liberties and freedoms was in large part a reaction to the steep and rigid stratification of agrarian societies.

===Industrial===
Industrial societies, which emerged in the 18th century in the Industrial Revolution, rely heavily on machines powered by external sources for the mass production of goods. Whereas in pre-industrial societies the majority of labor takes place in primary industries focused on extracting raw materials (farming, fishing, mining, etc.), in industrial societies, labor is mostly focused on processing raw materials into finished products. Present-day societies vary in their degree of industrialization, with some using mostly newer energy sources (e.g. coal, oil, and nuclear energy), and others continuing to rely on human and animal power.

Industrialization is associated with population booms and the growth of cities. Increased productivity, as well as the stability caused by improved transportation, leads to decreased mortality and resulting population growth. Centralized production of goods in factories and a decreased need for agricultural labor leads to urbanization. Industrial societies are often capitalist, and have high degrees of inequality along with high social mobility, as businesspeople use the market to amass large amounts of wealth. Working conditions in factories are generally restrictive and harsh. Workers, who have common interests, may organize into labor unions to advance those interests.

On the whole, industrial societies are marked by the increased power of human beings. Technological advancements mean that industrial societies have increased potential for deadly warfare. Governments use information technologies to exert greater control over the populace. Industrial societies also have an increased environmental impact.

===Post-industrial===
Post-industrial societies are societies dominated by information and services, rather than the production of goods. Advanced industrial societies see a shift toward an increase in service sectors, over manufacturing. Service industries include education, health and finance.

==== Information ====

An information society is a society where the usage, creation, distribution, manipulation and integration of information is a significant activity. Proponents of the idea that modern-day global society is an information society posit that information technologies are impacting most important forms of social organization, including education, economy, health, government, warfare, and levels of democracy. Although the concept of information society has been discussed since the 1930s, in the present day, it is almost always applied to ways that information technologies impact society and culture. It therefore covers the effects of computers and telecommunications on the home, the workplace, schools, government, and various communities and organizations, as well as the emergence of new social forms in cyberspace.

==== Knowledge ====
As the access to electronic information resources increased at the beginning of the 21st century, special attention was extended from the information society to the knowledge society. A knowledge society generates, shares, and makes available to all members of the society knowledge that may be used to improve the human condition. A knowledge society differs from an information society in that it transforms information into resources that allow society to take effective action, rather than only creating and disseminating raw data.

==Characteristics==
=== Norms and roles ===
Social norms are shared standards of acceptable behavior by groups. Social norms, which can both be informal understandings that govern the behavior of members of a society, as well as be codified into and laws, are powerful drivers of human behavior.

Social roles are norms, duties, and patterns of behavior that relate to an individual&#x27;s social status. In functionalist thought, individuals form the structure of society by occupying social roles. According to symbolic interactionism, individuals use symbols to navigate and communicate roles. Erving Goffman used the metaphor of a theater to develop the dramaturgical lens, which argues that roles provide scripts that govern social interactions.

=== Gender and kinship ===
The division of humans into male and female gender roles has been marked culturally by a corresponding division of norms, practices, dress, behavior, rights, duties, privileges, status, and power. Some argue that gender roles arise naturally from sex differences, which lead to a division of labor where women take on reproductive labor and other domestic roles. Gender roles have varied historically, and challenges to predominant gender norms have recurred in many societies.

All human societies organize, recognize and classify types of social relationships based on relations between parents, children and other descendants (consanguinity), and relations through marriage (affinity). There is also a third type of familial relationship applied to godparents or adoptive children (fictive). These culturally defined relationships are referred to as kinship. In many societies, it is one of the most important social organizing principles and plays a role in transmitting status and inheritance. All societies have rules of incest taboo, according to which marriage between certain kinds of kin relations are prohibited; and some societies also have rules of preferential marriage with certain other kin relations.

===Ethnicity===

Human ethnic groups are a social category that identify together as a group based on shared attributes that distinguish them from other groups. These shared attributes can be a common set of traditions, ancestry, language, history, society, culture, nation, religion, or social treatment within their residing area. There is no generally accepted definition of what constitutes an ethnic group, and humans have evolved the ability to change affiliation with social groups relatively easily, including leaving groups with previously strong alliances, if doing so is seen as providing personal advantages. Ethnicity is separate from the concept of race, which is based on physical characteristics, although both are socially constructed. Assigning ethnicity to a certain population is complicated, as even within common ethnic designations there can be a diverse range of subgroups, and the makeup of these ethnic groups can change over time at both the collective and individual level. Ethnic groupings can play a powerful role in the social identity and solidarity of ethnopolitical units. Ethnic identity has been closely tied to the rise of the nation state as the predominant form of political organization in the 19th and 20th centuries.

=== Government and politics ===
Governments create laws and policies that affect the people that they govern. There have been many forms of government throughout human history, with various ways of allocating power, and with different levels and means of control over the population. In early history, distribution of political power was determined by the availability of fresh water, fertile soil, and temperate climate of different locations. As farming populations gathered in larger and denser communities, interactions between different groups increased, leading to the further development of governance within and between communities.

, according to &quot;The Economist&quot;, 43% of national governments were democracies, 35% autocracies, and 22% containing elements of both. Many countries have formed international political organizations and alliances, the largest being the United Nations with 193 member states.

===Trade and economics===
Trade, the voluntary exchange of goods and services, has long been an aspect of human societies, and it is seen as a characteristic that differentiates humans from other animals. Trade has even been cited as a practice that gave &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; a major advantage over other hominids; evidence suggests early &quot;H. sapiens&quot; made use of long-distance trade routes to exchange goods and ideas, leading to cultural explosions and providing additional food sources when hunting was sparse. Such trade networks did not exist for the now-extinct Neanderthals. Early trade involved materials for creating tools, like obsidian, exchanged over short distances. In contrast, throughout antiquity and the medieval period, some of the most influential long-distance routes carried food and luxury goods, such as the spice trade.

Early human economies were more likely to be based around gift giving than a bartering system. Early money consisted of commodities; the oldest being in the form of cattle and the most widely used being cowrie shells. Money has since evolved into governmental issued coins, paper and electronic money. Human study of economics is a social science that looks at how societies distribute scarce resources among different people. There are massive inequalities in the division of wealth among humans; as of 2018 in China, Europe, and the United States, the richest tenth of humans hold more than seven-tenths of those regions&#x27; total wealth.

===Conflict===
The willingness of humans to kill other members of their species &quot;en masse&quot; through organized conflict (i.e. war) has long been the subject of debate. One school of thought is that war evolved as a means to eliminate competitors, and that violence is an innate human characteristic. Humans commit violence against other humans at a rate comparable to other primates (although humans kill adults at a relatively high rate and have a relatively low rate of infanticide).

Another school of thought suggests that war is a relatively recent phenomenon and appeared due to changing social conditions. While not settled, the current evidence suggests warlike behavior only became common about 10,000 years ago, and in many regions even more recently.

Phylogenetic analysis predicts 2% of human deaths to be caused by homicide, which approximately matches the rate of homicide in band societies. However, rates of violence vary widely according to societal norms, and rates of homicide in societies that have legal systems and strong cultural attitudes against violence stand at about 0.01%.

<text>Kevin James Anderson (born March 27, 1962) is an American science fiction author. He has written spin-off novels for &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;StarCraft&quot;, &quot;Titan A.E.&quot; and &quot;The X-Files&quot;, and with Brian Herbert is the co-author of the &quot;Dune&quot; prequel series. His original works include the &quot;Saga of Seven Suns&quot; series and the Nebula Award–nominated &quot;Assemblers of Infinity&quot;. He has also written several comic books, including the Dark Horse &quot;Star Wars&quot; series &quot;Tales of the Jedi&quot; written in collaboration with Tom Veitch, Dark Horse &quot;Predator&quot; titles, and &quot;The X-Files&quot; titles for Topps. Some of Anderson&#x27;s superhero novels include &quot;Enemies &amp; Allies&quot;, about the first meeting of Batman and Superman, and &quot;The Last Days of Krypton&quot;, telling the story of how Superman&#x27;s planet Krypton came to be destroyed.

Anderson has published over 140 books, over 50 of which have been on US and international bestseller lists, and he has more than 23 million books in print worldwide.

Anderson is working as a professor at Western Colorado University. Anderson has been a Literary Guest of Honor and Keynote Speaker at the Life, the Universe, &amp; Everything professional science fiction and fantasy arts symposium, on at least three occasions: 2016, 2006 and 1993. In 2021, Anderson was inducted into the Colorado Authors Hall of Fame along with Stephen King and James Michener.

==Early and personal life==
Kevin J. Anderson was born March 27, 1962, in Racine, Wisconsin, and grew up in Oregon, Wisconsin. According to Anderson, &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; greatly influenced him. At the age of eight, he wrote his first story, titled &quot;Injection&quot;. At ten, he bought a typewriter and has written ever since. In his freshman year in high school, he submitted his first short story to a magazine, but it took two more years before one of his manuscripts was accepted. When it was accepted, they paid him in copies of the magazine. In his senior year, he sold his first story for money for $12.50.

For 12 years Anderson worked at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where he met fellow writers Rebecca Moesta and Doug Beason. Anderson later married Moesta and frequently coauthors novels with both her and Beason.

==Career==

Anderson&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Resurrection, Inc.&quot;, was published in 1988 and nominated for a Bram Stoker Award for Best First Novel. His 1993 collaboration with Beason, &quot;Assemblers of Infinity&quot;, was nominated for both a Nebula and Locus Award. Anderson wrote &quot;The X-Files&quot; novels &quot;Ground Zero&quot; (1995), &quot;Ruins&quot; (1996) and &quot;Antibodies&quot; (1997). &quot;Ground Zero&quot; reached #1 on the &quot;London Sunday Times&quot; Best Seller List and &quot;Ruins&quot; made the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. Contracted to write novels in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; expanded universe, Anderson published the &quot;Jedi Academy&quot; trilogy in 1994, followed by the 1996 novel &quot;Darksaber&quot;. He and Moesta also wrote the 14-volume &quot;Young Jedi Knights&quot; series from 1995 to 1998. As a noted &quot;Star Wars&quot; novelist, Anderson was a participant in the FidoNet &quot;Star Wars&quot; Echo, a 1990s bulletin board system forum cited as one of the earliest influential forms of &quot;Star Wars&quot; on-line fandom.

In 1997, Anderson and Brian Herbert signed a $3 million deal with Bantam Books to coauthor a prequel trilogy to the 1965 novel &quot;Dune&quot; and its five sequels (1969–1985) by Herbert&#x27;s deceased father, Frank Herbert. Starting with 1999&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, the ongoing &quot;Dune&quot; prequel series has expanded to ten novels to date. In 2011 &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; called the series &quot;a sprawling edifice that Frank Herbert&#x27;s son and Anderson have built on the foundation of the original &quot;Dune&quot; novels.&quot; Anderson and Brian Herbert have also published &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot; (2006) and &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot; (2007), sequels to Frank Herbert&#x27;s final novel &quot;&quot; (1985) which complete the chronological progression of his original series and wrap up storylines that began with his &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot; (1984). Between 2011 and 2014, Anderson and Herbert also released their &quot;Hellhole&quot; trilogy of novels unrelated to &quot;Dune&quot;.

In 2002, Anderson released the steampunk/adventure novel &quot;Captain Nemo: The Fantastic History of a Dark Genius&quot; and was subsequently asked to write &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; (2003), a novelization of the film of the same name. The following year he also wrote the novelization for the 2004 film &quot;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow&quot;. In 2005, Anderson co-wrote, along with Dean Koontz, the first book in the Frankenstein series called &quot;Frankenstein, Prodigal Son&quot;.

Between 2002 and 2008, Anderson published a seven-novel original space opera series called &quot;The Saga of Seven Suns&quot;. In 2014 he began publishing a sequel trilogy called &quot;The Saga of Shadows&quot;. Anderson published four novels and two short stories in his &quot;Dan Shamble, Zombie P.I.&quot; series between 2012 and 2014. In 2012, Anderson coauthored a novelization of &quot;Clockwork Angels&quot;, an album by the Canadian rock band Rush, with Rush&#x27;s drummer, Neil Peart. Anderson and Peart reunited in 2015 for a sequel, &quot;Clockwork Lives&quot;.

===WordFire Press===
In 2011, Anderson and Moesta founded their own publishing imprint, WordFire Press, to reissue some of their out-of-print books in paperback and/or e-book formats. They have subsequently published and reprinted works in various genres, including several out-of-print or previously unpublished novels by Frank Herbert.

In 2013, WordFire acquired the reprint rights to the works of Allen Drury, including his 1959 Pulitzer Prize-winning political novel &quot;Advise and Consent&quot;. That novel, out of print for nearly 15 years, ranked #27 on the 2013 BookFinder.com list of the Top 100 Most Searched for Out of Print Books before WordFire reissued it in February 2014. The company also reprinted &quot;Advise and Consent&quot; five sequels — &quot;A Shade of Difference&quot; (1962), &quot;Capable of Honor&quot; (1966), &quot;Preserve and Protect&quot; (1968), &quot;Come Nineveh, Come Tyre&quot; (1973), and &quot;The Promise of Joy&quot; (1975) — as well as Drury&#x27;s later novels &quot;Mark Coffin, U.S.S.&quot; (1979) and &quot;Decision&quot; (1983).

WordFire released four previously unpublished novels by Frank Herbert, who died in 1986: &quot;High-Opp&quot; (2012), &quot;Angels&#x27; Fall&quot; (2013), &quot;A Game of Authors&quot; (2013), and &quot;A Thorn in the Bush&quot; (2014). Anderson announced these in his blog. WordFire also reissued several of Herbert&#x27;s unavailable titles: &quot;&quot; (1966), &quot;The Heaven Makers&quot; (1968), &quot;Soul Catcher&quot; (1972), &quot;The Godmakers&quot; (1972), and &quot;Direct Descent&quot; (1980) — as well as &quot;Man of Two Worlds&quot; (1986), an out-of-print novel cowritten by Herbert and his son Brian. WordFire also possesses non-US/Canadian e-book rights to some of Anderson&#x27;s own collaborations with Brian Herbert, the &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; trilogy (1999–2001), as well as Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Dan Shamble, Zombie P.I.&quot; series of novels.

<doc id="37242" wikidata="Q319871" url="?curid=37242" title="Booker T. Washington">
<text>Booker Taliaferro Washington (April 5, 1856November 14, 1915) was an American educator, author, and orator. Between 1890 and 1915, Washington was the primary leader in the African-American community and of the contemporary Black elite.
Born into slavery on April 5, 1856, in Hale&#x27;s Ford, Virginia, Washington was freed when U.S. troops reached the area during the Civil War. As a young man, Booker T. Washington worked his way through Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute and attended college at Wayland Seminary. In 1881, he was named as the first leader of the new Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, an institute for black higher education. He expanded the college, enlisting students in construction of buildings. Work at the college was considered fundamental to students&#x27; larger education. He attained national prominence for his Atlanta Address of 1895, which attracted the attention of politicians and the public. Washington played a dominant role in black politics, winning wide support in the black community of the South and among more liberal whites. Washington wrote an autobiography, &quot;Up from Slavery&quot;, in 1901, which became a major text. In that year, he dined with Theodore Roosevelt at the White House, which was the first time a black person publicly met the president on equal terms. After an illness, he died in Tuskegee, Alabama on November 14, 1915.
Washington was a key proponent of African-American businesses and one of the founders of the National Negro Business League. Washington mobilized a nationwide coalition of middle-class blacks, church leaders, and white philanthropists and politicians, with the goal of building the community&#x27;s economic strength and pride by focusing on self-help and education. Washington had the ear of the powerful in the United States of his day, including presidents. He used the nineteenth-century American political system to manipulate the media, raise money, develop strategy, network, distribute funds, and reward a cadre of supporters. Because of his influential leadership, the timespan of his activity, from 1880 to 1915, has been called the Age of Booker T. Washington. Washington called for Black progress through education and entrepreneurship, rather than trying to challenge directly the Jim Crow segregation and the disenfranchisement of Black voters in the South. Furthermore, he supported racial uplift, but secretly also supported court challenges to segregation and to restrictions on voter registration. Black activists in the North, led by W. E. B. Du Bois, disagreed with him and opted to set up the NAACP to work for political change.
After his death in 1915, he came under heavy criticism for accommodating white supremacy, despite his claims that his long-term goal was to end the disenfranchisement of African Americans, the vast majority of whom still lived in the South. Decades after Washington&#x27;s death in 1915, the civil rights movement of the 1950s took a more active and progressive approach, which was also based on new grassroots organizations based in the South. Washington&#x27;s legacy has been controversial in the civil rights community. However, a revisionist view appeared in the late twentieth century that interpreted his actions positively.

== Early life ==

Booker was born into slavery to Jane, an enslaved African-American woman on the plantation of James Burroughs in southwest Virginia, near Hale&#x27;s Ford in Franklin County. He never knew the day, month, and year of his birth (although evidence emerged after his death that he was born on April 5, 1856). Nor did he ever know his father, said to be a white man who resided on a neighboring plantation. The man played no financial or emotional role in Washington&#x27;s life.

From his earliest years, Washington was known simply as &quot;Booker&quot;, with no middle or surname, in the practice of the time. His mother, her relatives and his siblings struggled with the demands of slavery. He later wrote:

I cannot remember a single instance during my childhood or early boyhood when our entire family sat down to the table together, and God&#x27;s blessing was asked, and the family ate a meal in a civilized manner. On the plantation in Virginia, and even later, meals were gotten to the children very much as dumb animals get theirs. It was a piece of bread here and a scrap of meat there. It was a cup of milk at one time and some potatoes at another.

When he was nine, Booker and his family in Virginia gained freedom under the Emancipation Proclamation as U.S. troops occupied their region. Booker was thrilled by the formal day of their emancipation in early 1865:

As the great day drew nearer, there was more singing in the slave quarters than usual. It was bolder, had more ring, and lasted later into the night. Most of the verses of the plantation songs had some reference to freedom... [S]ome man who seemed to be a stranger (a United States officer, I presume) made a little speech and then read a rather long paper—the Emancipation Proclamation, I think. After the reading we were told that we were all free, and could go when and where we pleased. My mother, who was standing by my side, leaned over and kissed her children, while tears of joy ran down her cheeks. She explained to us what it all meant, that this was the day for which she had been so long praying, but fearing that she would never live to see.

After emancipation Jane took her family to the free state of West Virginia to join her husband, Washington Ferguson, who had escaped from slavery during the war and settled there. The illiterate boy Booker began painstakingly to teach himself to read and attended school for the first time.

At school, Booker was asked for a surname for registration. He chose the family name of Washington. Still later he learned from his mother that she had originally given him the name &quot;Booker Taliaferro&quot; at the time of his birth, but his second name was not used by the master. Upon learning of his original name, Washington immediately readopted it as his own, and became known as Booker Taliaferro Washington for the rest of his life.

Booker loved books:

== Higher education ==
Washington worked in salt furnaces and coal mines in West Virginia for several years to earn money. At age 16, he made his way east—mostly on foot—to Hampton Institute, a school established in Virginia to educate freedmen and their descendants, where he also worked as a janitor to pay for his studies. Washington arrived to campus with very little money; and his entrance exam was to clean a room. Upon graduating from Hampton at age 19, Washington briefly returned home to West Virginia. He later attended Wayland Seminary in Washington, D.C. in 1878.

== Tuskegee Institute ==

In 1881, the Hampton Institute president Samuel C. Armstrong recommended Washington, then age 25, to become the first leader of Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute (later Tuskegee Institute, now Tuskegee University), the new normal school (teachers&#x27; college) in Alabama. The new school opened on July 4, 1881, initially using a room donated by Butler Chapel A.M.E. Zion Church.
The next year, Washington purchased a former plantation to be developed as the permanent site of the campus. Under his direction, his students literally built their own school: making bricks, constructing classrooms, barns and outbuildings; and growing their own crops and raising livestock; both for learning and to provide for most of the basic necessities. Both men and women had to learn trades as well as academics. The Tuskegee faculty used all the activities to teach the students basic skills to take back to their mostly rural black communities throughout the South. The main goal was not to produce farmers and tradesmen, but teachers of farming and trades who could teach in the new lower schools and colleges for blacks across the South. The school expanded over the decades, adding programs and departments, to become the present-day Tuskegee University.
The Oaks, &quot;a large comfortable home,&quot; was built on campus for Washington and his family. They moved into the house in 1900. Washington lived there until his death in 1915. His widow, Margaret, lived at The Oaks until her death in 1925.

In 1896 when Washington reviewed the study conducted by George Washington Carver about the infection plaguing the soybean crop he invited Carver to head the Agriculture Department at Tuskegee, where they became close friends. Carver later autographed commemorative stamps issued in 1940 in Washington&#x27;s honor.

== Later career ==
Washington led Tuskegee for more than 30 years after becoming its leader. As he developed it, adding to both the curriculum and the facilities on the campus, he became a prominent national leader among African Americans, with considerable influence with wealthy white philanthropists and politicians.

Washington expressed his vision for his race through the school. He believed that by providing needed skills to society, African Americans would play their part, leading to acceptance by white Americans. He believed that blacks would eventually gain full participation in society by acting as responsible, reliable American citizens. Shortly after the Spanish–American War, President William McKinley and most of his cabinet visited Booker Washington. By his death in 1915, Tuskegee had grown to encompass more than 100 well-equipped buildings, roughly 1,500 students, 200 faculty members teaching 38 trades and professions, and an endowment of approximately $2 million (~$ in ).

Washington helped develop other schools and colleges. In 1891 he lobbied the West Virginia legislature to locate the newly authorized West Virginia Colored Institute (today West Virginia State University) in the Kanawha Valley of West Virginia near Charleston. He visited the campus often and spoke at its first commencement exercise.

Washington was a dominant figure of the African-American community, then still overwhelmingly based in the South, from 1890 to his death in 1915. His Atlanta Address of 1895 received national attention. He was a popular spokesman for African-American citizens. Representing the last generation of black leaders born into slavery, Washington was generally perceived as a supporter of education for freedmen and their descendants in the post-Reconstruction, Jim Crow-era South. He stressed basic education and training in manual and domestic labor trades because he thought these represented the skills needed in what was still a rural economy.

Throughout the final twenty years of his life, he maintained his standing through a nationwide network of supporters including black educators, ministers, editors, and businessmen, especially those who supported his views on social and educational issues for blacks. He also gained access to top national white leaders in politics, philanthropy and education, raised large sums, was consulted on race issues, and was awarded honorary degrees from Harvard University in 1896 and Dartmouth College in 1901.

Late in his career, Washington was criticized by civil rights leader and NAACP founder W. E. B. Du Bois. Du Bois and his supporters opposed the Atlanta Address as the &quot;Atlanta Compromise&quot;, because it suggested that African Americans should work for, and submit to, white political rule. Du Bois insisted on full civil rights, due process of law, and increased political representation for African Americans which, he believed, could only be achieved through activism and higher education for African Americans. He believed that &quot;the talented tenth&quot; would lead the race. Du Bois labeled Washington, &quot;the Great Accommodator.&quot; Washington responded that confrontation could lead to disaster for the outnumbered blacks, and that cooperation with supportive whites was the only way to overcome racism in the long run.

While promoting moderation, Washington contributed secretly and substantially to mounting legal challenges activist African Americans launched against segregation and disenfranchisement of blacks. In his public role, he believed he could achieve more by skillful accommodation to the social realities of the age of segregation.

Washington&#x27;s work on education helped him enlist both the moral and substantial financial support of many major white philanthropists. He became a friend of such self-made men as Standard Oil magnate Henry Huttleston Rogers; Sears, Roebuck and Company President Julius Rosenwald; and George Eastman, inventor of roll film, founder of Eastman Kodak, and developer of a major part of the photography industry. These individuals and many other wealthy men and women funded his causes, including Hampton and Tuskegee institutes.

He also gave lectures to raise money for the school. On January 23, 1906, he lectured at Carnegie Hall in New York in the Tuskegee Institute Silver Anniversary Lecture. He spoke along with prominent orators of the day, including Mark Twain, Joseph Hodges Choate, and Robert Curtis Ogden; it was the start of a capital campaign to raise $1,800,000 (~$ in ) for the school.

The schools which Washington supported were founded primarily to produce teachers, as education was critical for the black community following emancipation. Freedmen strongly supported literacy and education as the keys to their future. When graduates returned to their largely impoverished rural southern communities, they still found few schools and educational resources, as the white-dominated state legislatures consistently underfunded black schools in their segregated system.

To address those needs, in the 20th century, Washington enlisted his philanthropic network to create matching funds programs to stimulate construction of numerous rural public schools for black children in the South. Working especially with Julius Rosenwald from Chicago, Washington had Tuskegee architects develop model school designs. The Rosenwald Fund helped support the construction and operation of more than 5,000 schools and related resources for the education of blacks throughout the South in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The local schools were a source of communal pride; African-American families gave labor, land and money to them, to give their children more chances in an environment of poverty and segregation. A major part of Washington&#x27;s legacy, the model rural schools continued to be constructed into the 1930s, with matching funds for communities from the Rosenwald Fund.

Washington also contributed to the Progressive Era by forming the National Negro Business League. It encouraged entrepreneurship among black businessmen, establishing a national network.

His autobiography, &quot;Up from Slavery,&quot; first published in 1901, is still widely read in the early 21st century.

== Marriages and children ==

Washington was married three times. In his autobiography &quot;Up from Slavery&quot;, he gave all three of his wives credit for their contributions at Tuskegee. His first wife Fannie N. Smith was from Malden, West Virginia, the same Kanawha River Valley town where Washington had lived from age nine to sixteen. He maintained ties there all his life, and Smith was a student of his when he taught in Malden. He helped her gain entrance into the Hampton Institute. Washington and Smith were married in the summer of 1882, a year after he became principal there. They had one child, Portia M. Washington, born in 1883. Fannie died in May 1884.

In 1885, the widower Washington married again, to Olivia A. Davidson (1854–1889). Born free in Virginia to a free woman of color and a father who had been freed from slavery, she moved with her family to the free state of Ohio, where she attended common schools. Davidson later studied at Hampton Institute and went North to study at the Massachusetts State Normal School at Framingham. She taught in Mississippi and Tennessee before going to Tuskegee to work as a teacher. Washington recruited Davidson to Tuskegee, and promoted her to vice-principal. They had two sons, Booker T. Washington Jr. and Ernest Davidson Washington, before she died in 1889.

In 1893, Washington married Margaret James Murray. She was from Mississippi and had graduated from Fisk University, a historically black college. They had no children together, but she helped rear Washington&#x27;s three children. Murray outlived Washington and died in 1925.

== Politics and the Atlanta compromise ==
Washington&#x27;s 1895 Atlanta Exhibition address was viewed as a &quot;revolutionary moment&quot; by both African Americans and whites across the country. At the time W. E. B. Du Bois supported him, but they grew apart as Du Bois sought more action to remedy disfranchisement and improve educational opportunities for blacks. After their falling out, Du Bois and his supporters referred to Washington&#x27;s speech as the &quot;Atlanta Compromise&quot; to express their criticism that Washington was too accommodating to white interests.

Washington advocated a &quot;go slow&quot; approach to avoid a harsh white backlash. He has been criticized for encouraging many youths in the South to accept sacrifices of potential political power, civil rights, and higher education. Washington believed that African Americans should &quot;concentrate all their energies on industrial education, and accumulation of wealth, and the conciliation of the South&quot;. He valued the &quot;industrial&quot; education, as it provided critical skills for the jobs then available to the majority of African Americans at the time, as most lived in the South, which was overwhelmingly rural and agricultural. He thought these skills would lay the foundation for the creation of stability that the African-American community required in order to move forward. He believed that in the long term, &quot;blacks would eventually gain full participation in society by showing themselves to be responsible, reliable American citizens&quot;. His approach advocated for an initial step toward equal rights, rather than full equality under the law, gaining economic power to back up black demands for political equality in the future. He believed that such achievements would prove to the deeply prejudiced white America that African Americans were not &quot;&#x27;naturally&#x27; stupid and incompetent&quot;.

Well-educated blacks in the North lived in a different society and advocated a different approach, in part due to their perception of wider opportunities. Du Bois wanted blacks to have the same &quot;classical&quot; liberal arts education as upper-class whites did, along with voting rights and civic equality. The latter two had been ostensibly granted since 1870 by constitutional amendments after the Civil War. He believed that an elite, which he called the talented tenth, would advance to lead the race to a wider variety of occupations. Du Bois and Washington were divided in part by differences in treatment of African Americans in the North versus the South; although both groups suffered discrimination, the mass of blacks in the South were far more constrained by legal segregation and disenfranchisement, which totally excluded most from the political process and system. Many in the North objected to being &#x27;led&#x27;, and authoritatively spoken for, by a Southern accommodationist strategy which they considered to have been &quot;imposed on them [Southern blacks] primarily by Southern whites&quot;.

Historian Clarence E. Walker wrote that, for white Southerners,
Free black people were &#x27;matter out of place&#x27;. Their emancipation was an affront to southern white freedom. Booker T. Washington did not understand that his program was perceived as subversive of a natural order in which black people were to remain forever subordinate or unfree.

Both Washington and Du Bois sought to define the best means post-Civil War to improve the conditions of the African-American community through education.

Blacks were solidly Republican in this period, having gained emancipation and suffrage with President Lincoln and his party. Fellow Republican President Ulysses S. Grant defended African Americans&#x27; newly won freedom and civil rights in the South by passing laws and using federal force to suppress the Ku Klux Klan, which had committed violence against blacks for years to suppress voting and discourage education. After Federal troops left in 1877 at the end of the Reconstruction era, many paramilitary groups worked to suppress black voting by violence. From 1890 to 1908 Southern states disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites through constitutional amendments and statutes that created barriers to voter registration and voting. Such devices as poll taxes and subjective literacy tests sharply reduced the number of blacks in voting rolls. By the late nineteenth century, Southern white Democrats defeated some biracial Populist-Republican coalitions and regained power in the state legislatures of the former Confederacy; they passed laws establishing racial segregation and Jim Crow. In the border states and North, blacks continued to exercise the vote; the well-established Maryland African-American community defeated attempts there to disfranchise them.

Washington worked and socialized with many national white politicians and industry leaders. He developed the ability to persuade wealthy whites, many of them self-made men, to donate money to black causes by appealing to their values. He argued that the surest way for blacks to gain equal social rights was to demonstrate &quot;industry, thrift, intelligence and property&quot;. He believed these were key to improved conditions for African Americans in the United States. Because African Americans had recently been emancipated and most lived in a hostile environment, Washington believed they could not expect too much at once. He said, &quot;I have learned that success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has had to overcome while trying to succeed.&quot;

Along with Du Bois, Washington partly organized the &quot;Negro exhibition&quot; at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris, where photos of Hampton Institute&#x27;s black students were displayed. These were taken by his friend Frances Benjamin Johnston. The exhibition demonstrated African Americans&#x27; positive contributions to United States&#x27; society.

Washington privately contributed substantial funds for legal challenges to segregation and disfranchisement, such as the case of &quot;Giles v. Harris&quot;, which was heard before the United States Supreme Court in 1903. Even when such challenges were won at the Supreme Court, southern states quickly responded with new laws to accomplish the same ends, for instance, adding &quot;grandfather clauses&quot; that covered white people and not black people in order to prevent black people from voting.

== Wealthy friends and benefactors ==

State and local governments historically underfunded black schools, although they were ostensibly providing &quot;separate but equal&quot; segregated facilities. White philanthropists strongly supported education financially. Washington encouraged them and directed millions of their money to projects all across the South that Washington thought best reflected his self-help philosophy. Washington associated with the richest and most powerful businessmen and politicians of the era, as well as many other educational leaders, such as William Rainey Harper, president of the University of Chicago. He was seen as a spokesperson for African Americans and became a conduit for funding educational programs.

His contacts included such diverse and well known entrepreneurs and philanthropists as Andrew Carnegie, William Howard Taft, John D. Rockefeller, Henry Huttleston Rogers, George Eastman, Julius Rosenwald, Robert Curtis Ogden, Collis Potter Huntington and William Henry Baldwin Jr. The latter donated large sums of money to agencies such as the Jeanes and Slater Funds. As a result, countless small rural schools were established through Washington&#x27;s efforts, under programs that continued many years after his death. Along with rich white men, the black communities helped their communities directly by donating time, money and labor to schools to match the funds required.

=== Henry Huttleston Rogers ===

A representative case of an exceptional relationship was Washington&#x27;s friendship with millionaire industrialist and financier Henry H. Rogers (1840–1909). Henry Rogers was a self-made man, who had risen from a modest working-class family to become a principal officer of Standard Oil, and one of the richest men in the United States. Around 1894, Rogers heard Washington speak at Madison Square Garden. The next day, he contacted Washington and requested a meeting, during which Washington later recounted that he was told that Rogers &quot;was surprised that no one had &#x27;passed the hat&#x27; after the speech&quot;. The meeting began a close relationship that extended over a period of 15 years. Although Washington and the very private Rogers were seen as friends, the true depth and scope of their relationship was not publicly revealed until after Rogers&#x27;s sudden death of a stroke in May 1909. Washington was a frequent guest at Rogers&#x27;s New York office, his Fairhaven, Massachusetts summer home, and aboard his steam yacht &quot;Kanawha&quot;.

A few weeks later, Washington went on a previously planned speaking tour along the newly completed Virginian Railway, a $40-million enterprise that had been built almost entirely from Rogers&#x27;s personal fortune. As Washington rode in the late financier&#x27;s private railroad car, &quot;Dixie&quot;, he stopped and made speeches at many locations. His companions later recounted that he had been warmly welcomed by both black and white citizens at each stop.

Washington revealed that Rogers had been quietly funding operations of 65 small country schools for African Americans, and had given substantial sums of money to support Tuskegee and Hampton institutes. He also noted that Rogers had encouraged programs with matching funds requirements so the recipients had a stake in the outcome.

=== Anna T. Jeanes ===
In 1907 Philadelphia Quaker Anna T. Jeanes (1822–1907) donated one million dollars to Washington for elementary schools for black children in the South. Her contributions and those of Henry Rogers and others funded schools in many poor communities.

=== Julius Rosenwald ===
Julius Rosenwald (1862–1932) was a Jewish American self-made wealthy man with whom Washington found common ground. By 1908, Rosenwald, son of an immigrant clothier, had become part-owner and president of Sears, Roebuck and Company in Chicago. Rosenwald was a philanthropist who was deeply concerned about the poor state of African-American education, especially in the segregated Southern states, where their schools were underfunded.

In 1912, Rosenwald was asked to serve on the Board of Directors of Tuskegee Institute, a position he held for the remainder of his life. Rosenwald endowed Tuskegee so that Washington could spend less time fundraising and more managing the school. Later in 1912, Rosenwald provided funds to Tuskegee for a pilot program to build six new small schools in rural Alabama. They were designed, constructed and opened in 1913 and 1914, and overseen by Tuskegee architects and staff; the model proved successful.

After Washington died in 1915, Rosenwald established the Rosenwald Fund in 1917, primarily to serve African-American students in rural areas throughout the South. The school building program was one of its largest programs. Using the architectural model plans developed by professors at Tuskegee Institute, the Rosenwald Fund spent over $4 million to help build 4,977 schools, 217 teachers&#x27; homes, and 163 shop buildings in 883 counties in 15 states, from Maryland to Texas. The Rosenwald Fund made matching grants, requiring community support, cooperation from the white school boards, and local fundraising. Black communities raised more than $4.7 million to aid the construction and sometimes donated land and labor; essentially they taxed themselves twice to do so. These schools became informally known as Rosenwald Schools. But the philanthropist did not want them to be named for him, as they belonged to their communities. By his death in 1932, these newer facilities could accommodate one-third of all African-American children in Southern U.S. schools.

== &quot;Up from Slavery&quot; to the White House ==
Washington&#x27;s long-term adviser, Timothy Thomas Fortune (1856–1928), was a respected African-American economist and editor of &quot;The New York Age&quot;, the most widely read newspaper in the black community within the United States. He was the ghost-writer and editor of Washington&#x27;s first autobiography, &quot;The Story of My Life and Work&quot;. Washington published five books during his lifetime with the aid of ghost-writers Timothy Fortune, Max Bennett Thrasher and Robert E. Park.

They included compilations of speeches and essays:
* &quot;The Story of My Life and Work&quot; (1900)
* &quot;Up from Slavery&quot; (1901)
* &quot;The Story of the Negro: The Rise of the Race from Slavery &quot; (2 vols., 1909)
* &quot;My Larger Education&quot; (1911)
* &quot;The Man Farthest Down&quot; (1912)

In an effort to inspire the &quot;commercial, agricultural, educational, and industrial advancement&quot; of African Americans, Washington founded the National Negro Business League (NNBL) in 1900.

When Washington&#x27;s second autobiography, &quot;Up from Slavery&quot;, was published in 1901, it became a bestseller—remaining the best-selling autobiography of an African American for over sixty years—and had a major effect on the African-American community and its friends and allies.

===Dinner at the White House===


In October 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt invited Washington to dine with him and his family at the White House. Although Republican presidents had met privately with black leaders, this was the first highly publicized social occasion when an African American was invited there on equal terms by the president. Democratic Party politicians from the South, including future governor of Mississippi James K. Vardaman and Senator Benjamin Tillman of South Carolina, indulged in racist personal attacks when they learned of the invitation. Both used the derogatory term for African Americans in their statements. The meeting was also condemned by the Democratic perennial presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan, who argued that &quot;the more advanced race never has consented, and probably never will consent, to be dominated by the less advanced&quot; despite him having previously praised Washington.

Vardaman described the White House as &quot;so saturated with the odor of the nigger that the rats have taken refuge in the stable,&quot; and declared, &quot;I am just as much opposed to Booker T. Washington as a voter as I am to the cocoanut-headed, chocolate-colored typical little coon who blacks my shoes every morning. Neither is fit to perform the supreme function of citizenship.&quot; Tillman said, &quot;The action of President Roosevelt in entertaining that nigger will necessitate our killing a thousand niggers in the South before they will learn their place again.&quot;

Ladislaus Hengelmüller von Hengervár, the Austro-Hungarian ambassador to the United States, who was visiting the White House on the same day, said he found a rabbit&#x27;s foot in Washington&#x27;s coat pocket when he mistakenly put on the coat. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described it as &quot;the left hind foot of a graveyard rabbit, killed in the dark of the moon&quot;. The &quot;Detroit Journal&quot; quipped the next day, &quot;The Austrian ambassador may have made off with Booker T. Washington&#x27;s coat at the White House, but he&#x27;d have a bad time trying to fill his shoes.&quot;

== Death ==

Despite his extensive travels and widespread work, Washington continued as principal of Tuskegee. Washington&#x27;s health was deteriorating rapidly in 1915; he collapsed in New York City and was diagnosed by two different doctors as having Bright&#x27;s disease, an inflammation of the kidneys, today called nephritis. Told he had only a few days left to live, Washington expressed a desire to die at Tuskegee. He boarded a train and arrived in Tuskegee shortly after midnight on November 14, 1915. He died a few hours later at the age of 59. His funeral was held on November 17, 1915, in the Tuskegee Institute Chapel. It was attended by nearly 8,000 people. He was buried nearby in the Tuskegee University Campus Cemetery.

At the time he was thought to have died of congestive heart failure, aggravated by overwork. In March 2006, his descendants permitted examination of medical records: these showed he had hypertension, with a blood pressure more than twice normal, and that he died of kidney failure brought on by high blood pressure.

At Washington&#x27;s death, Tuskegee&#x27;s endowment was close to $2,000,000 (). Washington&#x27;s greatest life&#x27;s work, the education of blacks in the South, was well underway and expanding.

== Honors and memorials ==

For his contributions to American society, Washington was granted an honorary master&#x27;s degree from Harvard University in 1896, followed by an honorary doctorate from Dartmouth College.

At the center of Tuskegee University, the Booker T. Washington Monument was dedicated in 1922. Called &quot;Lifting the Veil&quot;, the monument has an inscription reading: 

In 1934, Robert Russa Moton, Washington&#x27;s successor as president of Tuskegee University, arranged an air tour for two African-American aviators. Afterward the plane was renamed as the &quot;Booker T. Washington&quot;.

On April 7, 1940, Washington became the first African American to be depicted on a United States postage stamp.

In 1942, the liberty ship &quot;Booker T. Washington&quot; was named in his honor, the first major oceangoing vessel to be named after an African American. The ship was christened by noted singer Marian Anderson.
In 1946, he was honored on the first coin to feature an African American, the Booker T. Washington Memorial half dollar, which was minted by the United States until 1951.

On April 5, 1956, the hundredth anniversary of Washington&#x27;s birth, the house where he was born in Franklin County, Virginia was designated as the Booker T. Washington National Monument.

A state park in Chattanooga, Tennessee, was named in his honor, as was a bridge spanning the Hampton River adjacent to his &quot;alma mater&quot;, Hampton University.

In 1984, Hampton University dedicated a Booker T. Washington Memorial on campus near the historic Emancipation Oak, establishing, in the words of the university, &quot;a relationship between one of America&#x27;s great educators and social activists, and the symbol of Black achievement in education&quot;.

Numerous high schools, middle schools and elementary schools across the United States have been named after Booker T. Washington.

In 2000, West Virginia State University (WVSU; then West Va. State College), in cooperation with other organizations including the Booker T. Washington Association, established the Booker T. Washington Institute, to honor Washington&#x27;s boyhood home, the old town of Malden, and Washington&#x27;s ideals.

On October 19, 2009, WVSU dedicated a monument to Booker T. Washington. The event took place at WVSU&#x27;s Booker T. Washington Park in Malden, West Virginia. The monument also honors the families of African ancestry who lived in Old Malden in the early 20th century and who knew and encouraged Washington. Special guest speakers at the event included West Virginia Governor Joe Manchin III, Malden attorney Larry L. Rowe, and the president of WVSU. Musical selections were provided by the WVSU &quot;Marching Swarm&quot;.

At the end of the 2008 presidential election, the defeated Republican candidate Senator John McCain recalled the stir caused a century before when President Theodore Roosevelt invited Booker T. Washington to the White House. McCain noted the evident progress in the country with the election of Democratic Senator Barack Obama as the first African-American President of the United States.

==Legacy==
Booker T. Washington was so acclaimed as a public leader that the period of his activity, from 1880 to 1915, has been called the Age of Booker T. Washington. Historiography on Washington, his character, and the value of that leadership has varied dramatically. After his death, he came under heavy criticism in the civil rights community for accommodationism to white supremacy. However, since the late 20th century, a more balanced view of his very wide range of activities has appeared. As of 2010, the most recent studies, &quot;defend and celebrate his accomplishments, legacy, and leadership&quot;.

Washington was held in high regard by business-oriented conservatives, both white and black. Historian Eric Foner argues that the freedom movement of the late nineteenth century changed directions so as to align with America&#x27;s new economic and intellectual framework. Black leaders emphasized economic self-help and individual advancement into the middle class as a more fruitful strategy than political agitation. There was emphasis on education and literacy throughout the period after the Civil War. Washington&#x27;s famous Atlanta speech of 1895 marked this transition, as it called on blacks to develop their farms, their industrial skills, and their entrepreneurship as the next stage in emerging from slavery.

By this time, Mississippi had passed a new constitution, and other Southern states were following suit, or using electoral laws to raise barriers to voter registration; they completed disenfranchisement of blacks at the turn of the 20th century to maintain white supremacy. But at the same time, Washington secretly arranged to fund numerous legal challenges to such voting restrictions and segregation, which he believed was the way they had to be attacked.

Washington repudiated the historic abolitionist emphasis on unceasing agitation for full equality, advising blacks that it was counterproductive to fight segregation at that point. Foner concludes that Washington&#x27;s strong support in the black community was rooted in its widespread realization that, given their legal and political realities, frontal assaults on white supremacy were impossible, and the best way forward was to concentrate on building up their economic and social structures inside segregated communities. Historian C. Vann Woodward in 1951 wrote of Washington, &quot;The businessman&#x27;s gospel of free enterprise, competition, and &quot;laissez faire&quot; never had a more loyal exponent.&quot;

Historians since the late 20th century have been divided in their characterization of Washington: some describe him as a visionary capable of &quot;read[ing] minds with the skill of a master psychologist,&quot; who expertly played the political game in nineteenth-century Washington by its own rules. Others say he was a self-serving, crafty narcissist who threatened and punished those in the way of his personal interests, traveled with an entourage, and spent much time fundraising, signing autographs, and giving flowery patriotic speeches with much flag waving – acts more indicative of an artful political boss than an altruistic civil rights leader.

People called Washington the &quot;Wizard of Tuskegee&quot; because of his highly developed political skills and his creation of a nationwide political machine based on the black middle class, white philanthropy, and Republican Party support. Opponents called this network the &quot;Tuskegee Machine&quot;. Washington maintained control because of his ability to gain support of numerous groups, including influential whites and black business, educational and religious communities nationwide. He advised as to the use of financial donations from philanthropists and avoided antagonizing white Southerners with his accommodation to the political realities of the age of Jim Crow segregation.

The Tuskegee machine collapsed rapidly after Washington&#x27;s death. He was the charismatic leader who held it all together, with the aid of Emmett Jay Scott. But the trustees replaced Scott, and the elaborate system fell apart. Critics in the 1920s to 1960s, especially those connected with the NAACP, ridiculed Tuskegee as a producer of a class of submissive black laborers. Since the late 20th century, historians have given much more favorable view, emphasizing the school&#x27;s illustrious faculty and the progressive black movements, institutions and leaders in education, politics, architecture, medicine and other professions it produced who worked hard in communities across the United States, and indeed worldwide across the African Diaspora. Deborah Morowski points out that Tuskegee&#x27;s curriculum served to help students achieve a sense of personal and collective efficacy. She concludes:
:The social studies curriculum provided an opportunity for the uplift of African Americans at time when these opportunities were few and far between for black youth. The curriculum provided inspiration for African Americans to advance their standing in society, to change the view of southern whites toward the value of blacks, and ultimately, to advance racial equality.

At a time when most black Americans were poor farmers in the South and were ignored by the national black leadership, Washington&#x27;s Tuskegee Institute made their needs a high priority. It lobbied for government funds and especially from philanthropies that enabled the institute to provide model farming techniques, advanced training, and organizational skills. These included Annual Negro Conferences, the Tuskegee Experiment Station, the Agricultural Short Course, the Farmers&#x27; Institutes, the Farmers&#x27; County Fairs, the Movable School, and numerous pamphlets and feature stories sent free to the South&#x27;s black newspapers.

<text>Harriet Tubman (born Araminta Ross, – March 10, 1913) was an American abolitionist and social activist. After escaping slavery, Tubman made some 13 missions to rescue approximately 70 enslaved people, including her family and friends, using the network of antislavery activists and safe houses known collectively as the Underground Railroad. During the American Civil War, she served as an armed scout and spy for the Union Army. In her later years, Tubman was an activist in the movement for women&#x27;s suffrage.

Born into slavery in Dorchester County, Maryland, Tubman was beaten and whipped by slave masters as a child. Early in life, she suffered a traumatic head wound when an irate overseer threw a heavy metal weight, intending to hit another slave, but hit her instead. The injury caused dizziness, pain, and spells of hypersomnia, which occurred throughout her life. After her injury, Tubman began experiencing strange visions and vivid dreams, which she ascribed to premonitions from God. These experiences, combined with her Methodist upbringing, led her to become devoutly religious.

In 1849, Tubman escaped to Philadelphia, only to return to Maryland to rescue her family soon after. Slowly, one group at a time, she brought relatives with her out of the state, and eventually guided dozens of other enslaved people to freedom. Tubman (or &quot;Moses&quot;, as she was called) travelled by night and in extreme secrecy, and later said she &quot;never lost a passenger&quot;. After the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was passed, she helped guide escapees farther north into British North America (Canada), and helped newly freed people find work. Tubman met John Brown in 1858, and helped him plan and recruit supporters for his 1859 raid on Harpers Ferry.

When the Civil War began, Tubman worked for the Union Army, first as a cook and nurse, and then as an armed scout and spy. For her guidance of the raid at Combahee Ferry, which liberated more than 700 enslaved people, she is widely credited as the first woman to lead an armed military operation in the United States. After the war, she retired to the family home on property she had purchased in 1859 in Auburn, New York, where she cared for her aging parents. She was active in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement until illness overtook her and was admitted to a home for elderly African Americans, which she had helped establish years earlier. Tubman is commonly viewed as an icon of courage and freedom.

== Birth and family ==

Tubman was born Araminta &quot;Minty&quot; Ross to enslaved parents, Harriet (&quot;Rit&quot;) Green and Ben Ross. Rit was enslaved by Mary Pattison Brodess (and later her son Edward). Ben was enslaved by Anthony Thompson, who became Mary Brodess&#x27;s second husband, and who ran a large plantation near the Blackwater River in the Madison area of Dorchester County, Maryland.

As with many enslaved people in the United States, neither the exact year nor place of Tubman&#x27;s birth is known. Tubman reported the year of her birth as 1825, while her death certificate lists 1815 and her gravestone lists 1820. Historian Kate Larson&#x27;s 2004 biography of Tubman records the year as 1822, based on a midwife payment and several other historical documents, including her runaway advertisement. Based on Larson&#x27;s work, more recent biographies have accepted March 1822 as the most likely timing of Tubman&#x27;s birth.

Tubman&#x27;s maternal grandmother, Modesty, arrived in the U.S. on a slave ship from Africa; no information is available about her other ancestors. As a child, Tubman was told that she seemed like an Ashanti person because of her character traits, though no evidence has been found to confirm or deny this lineage. Her mother, Rit (who may have had a white father), was a cook for the Brodess family. Her father, Ben, was a skilled woodsman who managed the timber work on Thompson&#x27;s plantation. Tubman&#x27;s parents married around 1808, and according to court records, had nine children together: Linah, Mariah Ritty, Soph, Robert, Minty (Harriet), Ben, Rachel, Henry, and Moses.

Rit struggled to keep her family together as slavery threatened to tear it apart. Edward Brodess sold three of her daughters (Linah, Mariah Ritty, and Soph), separating them from the family forever. When a trader from Georgia approached Brodess about buying Rit&#x27;s youngest son, Moses, she hid him for a month, aided by other enslaved people and freedmen in the community. At one point she confronted Brodess about the sale. Finally, Brodess and &quot;the Georgia man&quot; came toward the slave quarters to seize the child, where Rit told them, &quot;You are after my son; but the first man that comes into my house, I will split his head open.&quot; Brodess backed away and abandoned the sale. Tubman&#x27;s biographers agree that stories told about this event within the family influenced her belief in the possibilities of resistance.

== Childhood ==

Tubman&#x27;s mother was assigned to &quot;the big house&quot; and had scarce time for her own family; consequently, as a child Tubman took care of a younger brother and baby, as was typical in large families. When she was five or six years old, Brodess hired her out as a nursemaid to a woman named &quot;Miss Susan&quot;. Tubman was ordered to care for the baby and rock the cradle as it slept; when the baby woke up and cried, Tubman was whipped. She later recounted a particular day when she was lashed five times before breakfast. She carried the scars for the rest of her life. She found ways to resist, such as running away for five days, wearing layers of clothing as protection against beatings, and fighting back.

Also in her childhood, Tubman was sent to work for a planter named James Cook. She had to check his muskrat traps in nearby marshes, even after contracting measles. She became so ill that Cook sent her back to Brodess, where her mother nursed her back to health. Brodess then hired her out again. She spoke later of her acute childhood homesickness, comparing herself to &quot;the boy on the Swanee River&quot;, an allusion to Stephen Foster&#x27;s song &quot;Old Folks at Home&quot;. As she grew older and stronger, she was assigned to field and forest work, driving oxen, plowing, and hauling logs.

As an adolescent, Tubman suffered a severe head injury when an overseer threw a metal weight at another slave who was attempting to flee. The weight struck Tubman instead, which she said &quot;broke my skull&quot;. Bleeding and unconscious, she was returned to her enslaver&#x27;s house and laid on the seat of a loom, where she remained without medical care for two days. After this incident, Tubman frequently experienced extremely painful headaches. She also began having seizures and would seemingly fall unconscious, although she claimed to be aware of her surroundings while appearing to be asleep. Larson suggests she may have had temporal lobe epilepsy, possibly as a result of brain injury; Clinton suggests her condition may have been narcolepsy or cataplexy. A definitive diagnosis is not possible due to lack of contemporary medical evidence, but this condition remained with her for the rest of her life.

After her injury, Tubman began experiencing visions and vivid dreams, which she interpreted as revelations from God. These spiritual experiences had a profound effect on Tubman&#x27;s personality and she acquired a passionate faith in God. Although Tubman was illiterate, she was told Bible stories by her mother and likely attended a Methodist church with her family. Mystical inspiration guided her actions. She rejected the teachings of white preachers who urged enslaved people to be passive and obedient victims to those who trafficked and enslaved them; instead she found guidance in the Old Testament tales of deliverance. This religious perspective informed her actions throughout her life.

== Family and marriage ==
Anthony Thompson promised to manumit Tubman&#x27;s father at age 45. After Thompson died, his son followed through with that promise in 1840. Tubman&#x27;s father continued working as a timber estimator and foreman for the Thompson family. Later in the 1840s, Tubman paid a white attorney five dollars () to investigate the legal status of her mother, Rit. The lawyer discovered that Atthow Pattison, the grandfather of Mary Brodess, indicated in his will that Rit and any of her children would be manumitted at age 45, and that any children born after she reached age 45 would be freeborn. The Pattison and Brodess families ignored this stipulation when they inherited the enslaved family, but taking legal action to enforce it was an impossible task for Tubman.

Around 1844, she married John Tubman, a free black man. Although little is known about him or their time together, the union was complicated because of her enslaved status. The mother&#x27;s status dictated that of children, and any children born to Harriet and John would be enslaved. Such blended marriagesfree people of color marrying enslaved peoplewere not uncommon on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where by this time, half the black population was free. Most African-American families had both free and enslaved members. Larson suggests that they might have planned to buy Tubman&#x27;s freedom.

Tubman changed her name from Araminta to Harriet soon after her marriage, though the exact timing is unclear. Larson suggests this happened right after the wedding, and Clinton suggests that it coincided with Tubman&#x27;s plans to escape from slavery. She adopted her mother&#x27;s name, possibly as part of a religious conversion, or to honor another relative.

== Escape from slavery ==

In 1849, Tubman became ill again, which diminished her value to slave traders. Edward Brodess tried to sell her, but could not find a buyer. Angry at him for trying to sell her and for continuing to enslave her relatives, Tubman began to pray for God to make Brodess change his ways. She said later: &quot;I prayed all night long for my master till the first of March; and all the time he was bringing people to look at me, and trying to sell me.&quot; When it appeared as though a sale was being concluded, Tubman changed her prayer: &quot;First of March I began to pray, &#x27;Oh Lord, if you ain&#x27;t never going to change that man&#x27;s heart, kill him, Lord, and take him out of the way&#x27;.&quot; A week later, Brodess died, and Tubman expressed regret for her earlier sentiments.

As in many estate settlements, Brodess&#x27;s death increased the likelihood that Tubman would be sold and her family broken apart. His widow, Eliza, began working to sell the family&#x27;s enslaved people. Tubman refused to wait for the Brodess family to decide her fate, despite her husband&#x27;s efforts to dissuade her. She later said that &quot;there was one of two things I had a right to, liberty or death; if I could not have one, I would have the other&quot;.

Tubman and her brothers, Ben and Henry, escaped from slavery on September 17, 1849. Tubman had been hired out to Anthony Thompson (the son of her father&#x27;s former owner), who owned a large plantation in an area called Poplar Neck in neighboring Caroline County; it is likely her brothers labored for Thompson as well. Because they were hired out, Eliza Brodess probably did not recognize their absence as an escape attempt for some time. Two weeks later, she posted a runaway notice in the Cambridge &quot;Democrat&quot;, offering a reward of up to US$100 each () for their capture and return to slavery. Once they had left, Tubman&#x27;s brothers had second thoughts. Ben may have regretted leaving his wife and children. The two men went back, forcing Tubman to return with them.

Sometime in October or November, Tubman escaped again, this time without her brothers. Before leaving she sang a farewell song to hint at her intentions, which she hoped would be understood by Mary, a trusted fellow slave: &quot;I&#x27;ll meet you in the morning&quot;, she intoned, &quot;I&#x27;m bound for the promised land.&quot; While her exact route is unknown, Tubman made use of the network known as the Underground Railroad. This informal system was composed of free and enslaved black people, white abolitionists, and other activists. Most prominent among the latter in Maryland at the time were Quakers (members of the Religious Society of Friends). The Preston area near Poplar Neck contained a substantial Quaker community and was probably an important first stop during Tubman&#x27;s escape. From there, she probably took a common route for people fleeing slaverynortheast along the Choptank River, through Delaware, and then north into Pennsylvania. A journey of nearly by foot would have taken between five days and three weeks.

Tubman had to travel by night, guided by the North Star and trying to avoid slave catchers eager to collect rewards for fugitive slaves. The &quot;conductors&quot; in the Underground Railroad used deceptions for protection. At an early stop, the lady of the house instructed Tubman to sweep the yard so as to seem to be working for the family. When night fell, the family hid her in a cart and took her to the next friendly house. Given her familiarity with the woods and marshes of the region, Tubman likely hid in these locales during the day. The particulars of her first journey are unknown; because other escapees from slavery used the routes, Tubman did not discuss them until later in life. She crossed into Pennsylvania with a feeling of relief and awe, and recalled the experience years later:
== Nicknamed &quot;Moses&quot; ==

After reaching Philadelphia, Tubman thought of her family. &quot;I was a stranger in a strange land,&quot; she said later. &quot;[M]y father, my mother, my brothers, and sisters, and friends were [in Maryland]. But I was free, and &quot;they&quot; should be free.&quot; While Tubman saved money from working odd jobs in Philadelphia and Cape May, New Jersey, the U.S. Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which forced law enforcement officials to assist in the capture of escaped slaveseven in states that had outlawed slaveryand heavily punished abetting escape. The law increased risks for those who had escaped slavery, more of whom therefore sought refuge in Southern Ontario, where slavery had been abolished. Racial tensions were also increasing in Philadelphia as poor Irish immigrants competed with free blacks for work.

In December 1850, Tubman was warned that her niece Kessiah and Kessiah&#x27;s children would soon be sold in Cambridge, Maryland. Tubman went to Baltimore, where her brother-in-law Tom Tubman hid her until the sale. Kessiah&#x27;s husband, a free black man named John Bowley, made the winning bid for his wife. While the auctioneer stepped away to have lunch, John, Kessiah and their children escaped to a nearby safe house. When night fell, Bowley sailed the family on a log canoe to Baltimore, where they met with Tubman, who brought the family to Philadelphia.

Early next year she returned to Maryland to guide away other family members. During her second trip, she recovered her youngest brother, Moses, along with two other men. Word of her exploits had encouraged her family, and she became more confident with each trip to Maryland.

In late 1851, Tubman returned to Dorchester County for the first time since her escape, this time to find her husband John. When she arrived there, she learned that John had married another woman named Caroline. Tubman sent word that he should join her, but he insisted that he was happy where he was. Suppressing her anger, she found some enslaved people who wanted to escape and led them to Philadelphia.
Because the Fugitive Slave Law had made the northern United States a more dangerous place for those escaping slavery to remain, many escapees began migrating to Southern Ontario. In December 1851, Tubman guided an unidentified group of 11 escapees, possibly including the Bowleys and several others she had helped rescue earlier, northward. There is evidence to suggest that Tubman and her group stopped at the home of abolitionist and former slave Frederick Douglass. Douglass and Tubman admired one another greatly as they both struggled against slavery. Years later he contrasted his efforts with hers, writing:

From 1851 to 1862, Tubman returned repeatedly to the Eastern Shore of Maryland, rescuing some 70 slaves in about 13 expeditions, including her other brothers, Henry, Ben, and Robert, their wives and some of their children. She also provided specific instructions to 50 to 60 additional enslaved people who escaped. Because of her efforts, she was nicknamed &quot;Moses&quot;, alluding to the biblical prophet who led the Hebrews to freedom from Egypt. One of her last missions into Maryland was to retrieve her aging parents. Her father purchased her mother from Eliza Brodess in 1855, but even when they were both free, the area was hostile. In 1857, Tubman received word that her father was at risk of arrest for harboring a group of eight people escaping slavery. She led her parents north to St. Catharines, Canada, where a community of formerly enslaved people, including other relatives and friends of Tubman, had gathered.

=== Routes and methods ===
Tubman&#x27;s dangerous work required ingenuity. She usually worked during winter, when long nights and cold weather minimized the chance of being seen. She would start the escapes on Saturday evenings, since newspapers would not print runaway notices until Monday morning. She used subterfuges to avoid detection. Tubman once disguised herself with a bonnet and carried two live chickens to give the appearance of running errands. Suddenly finding herself walking toward a former enslaver, she yanked the strings holding the birds&#x27; legs, and their agitation allowed her to avoid eye contact. Later she recognized a fellow train passenger as a former enslaver; she snatched a nearby newspaper and pretended to read. Tubman was known to be illiterate, and the man ignored her.

In an 1897 interview with historian Wilbur Siebert, Tubman named some people who helped her and places she stayed along the Underground Railroad. She stayed with Sam Green, a free black minister living in East New Market, Maryland; she also hid near her parents&#x27; home at Poplar Neck. She would travel from there northeast to Sandtown and Willow Grove, Delaware, and to the Camden area where free black agents, William and Nat Brinkley and Abraham Gibbs, guided her north past Dover, Smyrna, and Blackbird, where other agents would take her across the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal to New Castle and Wilmington. In Wilmington, Quaker Thomas Garrett would secure transportation to William Still&#x27;s office or the homes of other Underground Railroad operators in the greater Philadelphia area. Still is credited with helping hundreds escape to safer places in New York, New England, and Southern Ontario.

Tubman&#x27;s faith was another important resource as she ventured repeatedly into Maryland. The visions from her childhood head injury continued, and she saw them as divine premonitions. She spoke of &quot;consulting with God&quot;, and trusted that He would keep her safe. Garrett once said of her, &quot;I never met with any person of any color who had more confidence in the voice of God, as spoken direct to her soul.&quot; Her faith also provided immediate assistance. She used spirituals as coded messages, warning fellow travelers of danger or to signal a clear path. She sang versions of &quot;Go Down Moses&quot; and changed the lyrics to indicate that it was either safe or too dangerous to proceed. As she led escapees across the border, she would call out, &quot;Glory to God and Jesus, too. One more soul is safe!&quot;

She carried a revolver as protection from slave catchers and their dogs. Tubman also threatened to shoot anyone who tried to turn back since that would risk the safety of the remaining group, as well as anyone who helped them on the way. Tubman spoke of one man who insisted he was going to go back to the plantation. She pointed the gun at his head and said, &quot;Go on or die.&quot; Several days later, the man who wavered crossed into Canada with the rest of the group.

By the late 1850s, Eastern Shore slaveholders were holding public meetings about the large number of escapes in the area; they cast suspicion on free blacks and white abolitionists. They did not know that &quot;Minty&quot;, the petite, disabled woman who had run away years before, was responsible for freeing so many enslaved people. Though a popular legend persists about a reward of $40,000 () for Tubman&#x27;s capture, this is a manufactured figure: in 1867, in support of Tubman&#x27;s claim for a military pension, an abolitionist named Sallie Holley wrote that $40,000 &quot;was not too great a reward for Maryland slaveholders to offer for her&quot;. If it were real, such a high reward would have garnered national attention. A reward of $12,000 has also been claimed, though no documentation has been found for either figure.

Tubman and the fugitives she assisted were never captured. Years later, she told an audience: &quot;I was conductor of the Underground Railroad for eight years, and I can say what most conductors can&#x27;t sayI never ran my train off the track and I never lost a passenger.&quot;

== John Brown and Harpers Ferry ==
In April 1858, Tubman was introduced to the abolitionist John Brown, an insurgent who advocated the use of violence to destroy slavery in the United States. Although she was not previously involved in armed insurrection, she agreed with his course of direct action and supported his goals. Like Tubman, he spoke of being called by God, and trusted the divine to protect him from the wrath of slavers. She, meanwhile, claimed to have had a prophetic vision of meeting Brown before their encounter.

Thus, as he began recruiting supporters for an attack on slaveholders, Brown was joined by &quot;General Tubman&quot;, as he called her. Her knowledge of support networks and resources in the border states of Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware was invaluable to Brown and his planners. Although other abolitionists like Douglass did not endorse his tactics, Brown dreamed of fighting to create a new state for those freed from slavery, and made preparations for military action. He believed that after he began the first battle, the enslaved would rise up and carry out a rebellion across the slave states. He asked Tubman to gather former slaves then living in Southern Ontario who might be willing to join his fighting force, which she did.

On May 8, 1858, Brown held a meeting in Chatham, Canada, where he unveiled his plan for a raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia. When word of the plan was leaked to the government, Brown put the scheme on hold and began raising funds for its eventual resumption. Tubman aided him in this effort and with more detailed plans for the assault.

Tubman was busy during this time, giving talks to abolitionist audiences and tending to her relatives. In early October 1859, as Brown and his men prepared to launch the attack, Tubman was ill in New Bedford, Massachusetts. It is not known whether she still intended to join Brown&#x27;s raid or if she had become skeptical of the plan, but when the raid on Harpers Ferry took place on October 16, Tubman had recovered from her illness and was in New York City.

The raid failed; Brown was convicted of treason, murder, and inciting a rebellion, and he was hanged on December 2. His actions were seen by many abolitionists as a symbol of proud resistance, carried out by a noble martyr. Tubman herself was effusive with praise. She later told a friend: &quot;[H]e done more in dying, than 100 men would in living.&quot;

== Auburn and Margaret ==
In early 1859, Frances Adeline Seward, the wife of abolitionist Republican U.S. Senator William H. Seward, sold Tubman a farm in Fleming, New York, for $1,200 (). The adjacent city of Auburn was a hotbed of antislavery activism, and Tubman took the opportunity to move her parents from Canada back to the U.S. Her farmstead became a haven for Tubman&#x27;s family and friends. For years, she took in relatives and boarders, offering a safe place for black Americans seeking a better life in the north.

Shortly after acquiring the farm, Tubman went back to Maryland and returned with an eight-year-old light-skinned black girl named Margaret, who Tubman said was her niece. She also indicated the girl&#x27;s parents were free blacks. According to Margaret&#x27;s daughter Alice, Margaret later described her childhood home as prosperous and said that she left behind a twin brother. These descriptions conflict with what is known about the families of Tubman&#x27;s siblings, which created uncertainty among historians about the relationship and Tubman&#x27;s motivations. Alice called Tubman&#x27;s actions a &quot;kidnapping&quot;, saying, &quot;she had taken the child from a sheltered good home to a place where there was nobody to care for her&quot;. After speculating in her 2004 biography of Tubman that Margaret might have been Tubman&#x27;s own secret daughter, Kate Larson found evidence that Margaret was the daughter of Isaac and Mary Woolford, a free black couple who were neighbors of Tubman&#x27;s parents in Maryland and who had twins named James and Margaret.

In November 1860, Tubman conducted her last rescue mission. Throughout the 1850s, Tubman had been unable to effect the escape of her sister Rachel, and Rachel&#x27;s two children Ben and Angerine. Upon returning to Dorchester County, Tubman discovered that Rachel had died, and the children could be rescued only if she could pay a bribe of $30 (). She did not have the money, so the children remained enslaved. Their fates remain unknown. Never one to waste a trip, Tubman gathered another group, including the Ennalls family, ready and willing to take the risks of the journey north. It took them weeks to get away safely because of slave catchers forcing them to hide out longer than expected. The weather was unseasonably cold and they had little food. The Ennalls&#x27; infant child was quieted with paregoric while slave patrols rode by. They safely reached the home of David and Martha Wright in Auburn on December 28, 1860.

== American Civil War ==

When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Tubman had a vision that the war would soon lead to the abolition of slavery. More immediately, enslaved people near Union positions began escaping in large numbers. General Benjamin Butler declared these escapees to be &quot;contraband&quot;property seized by northern forcesand put them to work, initially without pay, at Fort Monroe in Virginia. The number of &quot;contrabands&quot; encamped at Fort Monroe and other Union positions rapidly increased. In January 1862, Tubman volunteered to support the Union cause and began helping refugees in the camps, particularly in Port Royal, South Carolina.

In South Carolina, Tubman met General David Hunter, a strong supporter of abolition. He declared all of the &quot;contrabands&quot; in the Port Royal district free, and began gathering formerly enslaved people for a regiment of black soldiers. U.S. President Abraham Lincoln was not yet prepared to enforce emancipation on the southern states and reprimanded Hunter for his actions. Tubman condemned Lincoln&#x27;s response and his general unwillingness to consider ending slavery in the U.S., for both moral and practical reasons:

Tubman served as a nurse in Port Royal, preparing remedies from local plants and aiding soldiers suffering from dysentery and infectious diseases. At first, she received government rations for her work, but to dispel a perception that she was getting special treatment, she gave up her right to these supplies and made money selling pies and root beer, which she made in the evenings.

=== Scouting and the Combahee River Raid ===

When Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, Tubman considered it a positive but incomplete step toward the goal of liberating all black people from slavery. She turned her own efforts towards more direct actions to defeat the Confederacy. In early 1863, Tubman used her knowledge of covert travel and subterfuge to lead a band of scouts through the land around Port Royal. Her group, working under the orders of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, mapped the unfamiliar terrain and reconnoitered its inhabitants. She later worked alongside Colonel James Montgomery and provided him with intelligence that aided in the temporary capture of Jacksonville, Florida in March 1863.
Later that year, Tubman&#x27;s intelligence gathering played a key role in the raid at Combahee Ferry. She guided three steamboats with black soldiers under Montgomery&#x27;s command past mines on the Combahee River to assault several plantations. Once ashore, the Union troops set fire to the plantations, destroying infrastructure and seizing thousands of dollars worth of food and supplies. Forewarned of the raid by Tubman&#x27;s spy network, enslaved people throughout the area heard steamboats&#x27; whistles and understood that they were being liberated. Tubman went ashore to assist them onto the boats, ruining her dress in the process, and she sang lyrics from &quot;Uncle Sam&#x27;s Farm&quot; encouraging them to &quot;come along, come along&quot;. She later described a scene of chaos with women carrying still-steaming pots of rice, pigs squealing in bags slung over shoulders, and babies hanging around their parents&#x27; necks. Armed overseers tried to stop the mass escape, but their efforts were nearly useless in the tumult. As Confederate troops raced to the scene, the steamboats took off toward Beaufort with more than 750 formerly enslaved people.

Newspapers heralded Tubman&#x27;s &quot;patriotism, sagacity, energy, [and] ability&quot; in the raid, and she was praised for her recruiting effortsmore than 100 of the newly liberated men joined the Union army. Reports about her involvement in the raid led to a revival of the &quot;General Tubman&quot; appellation previously given to her by John Brown. Although her contributions have sometimes been exaggerated, her role in the raid led to her being widely credited as the first woman to lead U.S. troops in an armed assault.

In July 1863, Tubman worked with Colonel Robert Gould Shaw at the assault on Fort Wagner, reportedly serving him his last meal. She later described the battle to historian Albert Bushnell Hart:
For two more years, Tubman worked for the Union forces, tending to newly liberated people, scouting into Confederate territory, and nursing wounded soldiers in Virginia, a task she continued for several months after the Confederacy surrendered in April 1865.

== Later life ==

Tubman had received little pay for her Union military service. She was not a regular soldier and was only occasionally compensated for her work as a spy and scout; her work as a nurse was entirely unpaid. For over three years of service, she received a total of $200 (). Her unofficial status caused great difficulty in documenting her service, and the U.S. government was slow to recognize any debt to her. Meanwhile, her humanitarian work for her family and the formerly enslaved kept her in a state of constant poverty.

When a promised appointment to an official military nursing position fell through in July 1865, Tubman decided to return to her home in New York. During a train ride to New York in October 1865, Tubman traveled on a half-fare ticket provided to her because of her service. A conductor told her to move from a regular passenger car into the less-desirable smoking car. When she refused, he cursed at her and grabbed her. She resisted, and he summoned additional men for help. They muscled her into the smoking car, injuring her in the process. As these events transpired, white passengers cursed Tubman and told the conductor to kick her off the train.

Tubman spent her remaining years in Auburn, tending to her family and other people in need. In addition to managing her farm, she took in boarders and worked various jobs to pay the bills and support her elderly parents. One of the people Tubman took in was a farmer named Nelson Davis. Born enslaved in North Carolina, he had served as a private in the 8th United States Colored Infantry Regiment from September 1863 to November 1865. He began working in Auburn as a bricklayer, and they soon fell in love. Though he was 22 years younger than she was, on March 18, 1869, they were married at the Central Presbyterian Church. They adopted a baby girl named Gertie in 1874.
Tubman&#x27;s friends and supporters from the days of abolition, meanwhile, raised funds to support her. One admirer, Sarah Hopkins Bradford, wrote an authorized biography entitled &quot;Scenes in the Life of Harriet Tubman&quot;. The 132-page volume was published in 1869 and brought Tubman some $1,200 in income (). Even with this assistance, paying off the mortgage on her farm in May 1873 exhausted Tubman&#x27;s savings. That October, she fell prey to swindlers. Two black men claimed to know a former slave who had a trunk of gold coins smuggled out of South Carolina, which they would sell for cash at less than half the coins&#x27; value. She knew white people in the South had buried valuables when Union forces threatened the region, and black men were frequently assigned to digging duties, so the claim seemed plausible to her. She borrowed money from a wealthy friend and arranged to receive the gold late one night. Once the men had lured her into the woods, they knocked her out with chloroform and stole her purse. Tubman was found dazed and injured; the trunk was filled with rocks.

The crime brought new attention from local leaders to Tubman&#x27;s precarious financial state and spurred renewed efforts to get compensation for her Civil War service. In 1874, Representatives Clinton D. MacDougall of New York and Gerry W. Hazelton of Wisconsin introduced a bill to pay Tubman a $2,000 () lump sum &quot;for services rendered by her to the Union Army as scout, nurse, and spy&quot;, but it was defeated in the Senate. In February 1880, Tubman&#x27;s wood-framed house burned down, but with the help of her supporters it was quickly replaced with a new brick home.

Nelson Davis died of tuberculosis on October 14, 1888. The Dependent and Disability Pension Act of 1890 made Tubman eligible for a pension as his widow. After she documented her marriage and her husband&#x27;s service record to the satisfaction of the Bureau of Pensions, in 1895 Tubman was granted a monthly widow&#x27;s pension of $8 (), plus a lump sum of $500 to cover the five-year delay in approval. In December 1897, New York Congressman Sereno E. Payne introduced a bill to grant Tubman a soldier&#x27;s monthly pension of $25 (). Although Congress received documents and letters to support Tubman&#x27;s claims, some members objected to a woman being paid a full soldier&#x27;s pension. In February 1899, Congress approved a compromise amount of $20 () per month (the $8 from her widow&#x27;s pension plus $12 for her service as a nurse), but did not acknowledge her as a scout and spy.

=== Suffragist activism ===

In her later years, Tubman worked to promote the cause of women&#x27;s suffrage. A white woman once asked Tubman whether she believed women ought to have the vote, and received the reply: &quot;I suffered enough to believe it.&quot; Tubman began attending meetings of suffragist organizations, and was soon working alongside women such as Susan B. Anthony and Emily Howland.

Tubman traveled to New York, Boston and Washington, D.C., to speak in favor of women&#x27;s voting rights. She described her actions during and after the Civil War, and used the sacrifices of countless women throughout modern history as evidence of women&#x27;s equality to men. When the National Federation of Afro-American Women was founded, Tubman was the keynote speaker at its first conference in 1896. When the Federation was merged into the National Association of Colored Women, Tubman attended that organization&#x27;s second conference in 1899.

This wave of activism kindled a new wave of admiration for Tubman among the press in the United States. A publication called &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Era&quot; launched a series of articles on &quot;Eminent Women&quot; with a profile of Tubman. An 1897 suffragist newspaper reported a series of receptions in Boston honoring Tubman and her lifetime of service to the nation. However, her endless contributions to others had left her in poverty, and she had to sell a cow to buy a train ticket to these celebrations.

=== Church, illness, and death ===
In the 1870s, Tubman became active in the Thompson Memorial African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Zion Church in Auburn. In 1895, she began discussions with AME Zion leaders and others to create a Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged that would care for &quot;indigent colored people&quot;. Despite her financial limitations, in 1896 Tubman bid $1215 () at auction for a farm adjacent to the one she already owned, to use for the new facility. She designated one of the farm&#x27;s buildings as its primary residence and named it &quot;John Brown Hall&quot; to honor her late abolitionist ally. However, raising funds for the project was difficult, and attempts to donate the property were complicated by the multiple mortgage loans used to pay for it. After Tubman almost lost the property because of her financial difficulties, AME Zion agreed to take it over in 1903.

The home did not open for another five years, and Tubman was dismayed when the church ordered residents to pay a $100 entrance fee (). She said: &quot;[T]hey make a rule that nobody should come in without they have a hundred dollars. Now I wanted to make a rule that nobody should come in unless they didn&#x27;t have no money at all.&quot; She was frustrated by the new rule but was the guest of honor nonetheless when the home celebrated its opening on June 23, 1908.

As Tubman aged, her childhood head trauma continued to trouble her. Unable to sleep because of pain and &quot;buzzing&quot; in her head, in the late 1890s she asked a doctor at Boston&#x27;s Massachusetts General Hospital to operate. In her words, he &quot;sawed open my skull, and raised it up, and now it feels more comfortable&quot;. She reportedly received no anesthesia and instead bit down on a bullet, as she had seen Civil War soldiers do when their limbs were amputated.

By 1911, Tubman&#x27;s body was so frail that she was admitted into the rest home named in her honor. A New York newspaper described her as &quot;ill and penniless&quot;, prompting supporters to offer a new round of donations. Surrounded by friends and family members, she died of pneumonia on March 10, 1913. Just before she died, she quoted the Gospel of John to those in the room: &quot;I go away to prepare a place for you.&quot; Tubman was buried with semi-military honors at Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn.

== Legacy ==
Widely known and well-respected while she was alive, Tubman became an American icon in the years after she died. By the 1980s, Tubman had become one of American history&#x27;s most famous figures. She inspired generations of African Americans struggling for equality and civil rights; she was praised by leaders across the political spectrum.

=== Parks, monuments, and historical sites ===
National parks and national monuments related to Tubman in the United States are the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument and the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park, both in Maryland, and the Harriet Tubman National Historical Park in Auburn. The Salem Chapel in St. Catharines, where Tubman worshipped, is a National Historic Site of Canada.

The city of Auburn has several historical sites related to Tubman, including her gravesite. Other state and local historical sites about Tubman include the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad State Park and the Harriet Tubman Memorial Garden in Maryland, and the Harriet Tubman Museum is in New Jersey.

=== Artistic portrayals ===
Tubman is the subject of many works of art. Musicians including Woody Guthrie, Wynton Marsalis, and Walter Robinson have written songs celebrating her. She is the subject of operas by Thea Musgrave, Nkeiru Okoye, and Hilda Paredes, as well as plays by Carolyn Gage and a collaboration of May Miller and Willis Richardson. Tubman is the focus of novels by Elizabeth Cobbs, Marcy Heidish, and Anne Parrish, and is a character in novels by Terry Bisson, Ta-Nehisi Coates, and James McBride.

Since Tubman&#x27;s life was first dramatized on television in a 1963 episode of the series &quot;The Great Adventure&quot;, she has been portrayed in TV productions such as &quot;The Good Lord Bird&quot;, &quot;Timeless&quot;, &quot;Underground&quot;, and &quot;A Woman Called Moses&quot;. Cynthia Erivo received an Academy Award nomination for portraying Tubman in the 2019 theatrical film &quot;Harriet&quot;.

Artists including Fern Cunningham, Jane DeDecker, Nina Cooke John, and Alison Saar have presented Tubman in sculptures. She has been drawn or painted by numerous artists, including Romare Bearden, Aaron Douglas, William Johnson, Jacob Lawrence, and Faith Ringgold.

=== Other honors and commemorations ===

In 1978, Tubman became the first African-American woman honored on a U.S. postage stamp; she appeared on a second stamp in 1995. Beginning in 2016, there have been plans to add a portrait of Tubman to the front of the twenty-dollar bill, moving the portrait of President Andrew Jackson, a slaveholder, to the back of the bill. In 2024, the United States Mint issued three commemorative coins featuring Tubman; each coin depicts Tubman at a different stage of her life.

Dozens of schools, streets and highways, church groups, social organizations, and government agencies have been named after Tubman. In 1944, the United States Maritime Commission launched the , its first Liberty ship named for a black woman.

On November 11, 2024, Tubman was posthumously commissioned as a one-star general in the Maryland National Guard in recognition of her military service during the Civil War.

== Historiography ==
Tubman hoped to become literate and write her own memoirs, but she never did. Instead, Sarah Hopkins Bradford combined Tubman&#x27;s personal recollections, journalistic accounts, and letters from Tubman&#x27;s friends and supporters to create &quot;Scenes from the Life of Harriet Tubman&quot; in 1868. Criticized by modern biographers for its artistic license and highly subjective point of view, the book nevertheless provides insight into Tubman&#x27;s own view of her experiences. In 1886, Bradford released a re-written volume called &quot;Harriet, the Moses of her People&quot;. In both volumes Harriet Tubman is hailed as a latter-day Joan of Arc. The revision took a more moralistic and literary tone than the prior work, including changes of many event descriptions from first to third person. A final revision in 1901 added an appendix with more stories about Tubman&#x27;s life.

The first full biography of Tubman to be published after Bradford&#x27;s was Earl Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Harriet Tubman&quot; (1943). Conrad experienced great difficulty in finding a publisherthe search took four yearsand endured disdain and contempt for his efforts to construct a more objective, detailed account of Tubman&#x27;s life for adults. Several highly dramatized versions of Tubman&#x27;s life had been written for children, and many more came later, but Conrad wrote in an academic style. Though she was a popular historical figure, another book-length biography based on original scholarship did not appear for 60 years, when Jean Humez published a close reading of Tubman&#x27;s life stories in 2003. Larson and Clinton both published their biographies soon after in 2004. Historian Milton Sernett&#x27;s 2007 book &quot;Harriet Tubman: Myth, Memory, and History&quot; discusses the major biographies of Tubman up to that time.

<text>A radionuclide (radioactive nuclide, radioisotope or radioactive isotope) is a nuclide that has excess numbers of either neutrons or protons, giving it excess nuclear energy, and making it unstable. This excess energy can be used in one of three ways: emitted from the nucleus as gamma radiation; transferred to one of its electrons to release it as a conversion electron; or used to create and emit a new particle (alpha particle or beta particle) from the nucleus. During those processes, the radionuclide is said to undergo radioactive decay. These emissions are considered ionizing radiation because they are energetic enough to liberate an electron from another atom. The radioactive decay can produce a stable nuclide or will sometimes produce a new unstable radionuclide which may undergo further decay. Radioactive decay is a random process at the level of single atoms: it is impossible to predict when one particular atom will decay. However, for a collection of atoms of a single nuclide the decay rate, and thus the half-life (&quot;t&quot;1/2) for that collection, can be calculated from their measured decay constants. The range of the half-lives of radioactive atoms has no known limits and spans a time range of over 55 orders of magnitude.

Radionuclides occur naturally or are artificially produced in nuclear reactors, cyclotrons, particle accelerators or radionuclide generators. There are about 730 radionuclides with half-lives longer than 60 minutes (see list of nuclides). Thirty-two of those are primordial radionuclides that were created before the Earth was formed. At least another 60 radionuclides are detectable in nature, either as daughters of primordial radionuclides or as radionuclides produced through natural production on Earth by cosmic radiation. More than 2400 radionuclides have half-lives less than 60 minutes. Most of those are only produced artificially, and have very short half-lives. For comparison, there are about 251 stable nuclides. 

All chemical elements can exist as radionuclides. Even the lightest element, hydrogen, has a well-known radionuclide, tritium. Elements heavier than lead, and the elements technetium and promethium, exist only as radionuclides. 

Unplanned exposure to radionuclides generally has a harmful effect on living organisms including humans, although low levels of exposure occur naturally without harm. The degree of harm will depend on the nature and extent of the radiation produced, the amount and nature of exposure (close contact, inhalation or ingestion), and the biochemical properties of the element; with increased risk of cancer the most usual consequence. However, radionuclides with suitable properties are used in nuclear medicine for both diagnosis and treatment. An imaging tracer made with radionuclides is called a radioactive tracer. A pharmaceutical drug made with radionuclides is called a radiopharmaceutical.

==Origin==

===Natural===
On Earth, naturally occurring radionuclides fall into three categories: primordial radionuclides, secondary radionuclides, and cosmogenic radionuclides.
* Radionuclides are produced in stellar nucleosynthesis and supernova explosions along with stable nuclides. Most decay quickly but can still be observed astronomically and can play a part in understanding astronomic processes. Primordial radionuclides, such as uranium and thorium, exist in the present time because their half-lives are so long (&gt;100 million years) that they have not yet completely decayed. Some radionuclides have half-lives so long (many times the age of the universe) that decay has only recently been detected, and for most practical purposes they can be considered stable, most notably bismuth-209: detection of this decay meant that bismuth was no longer considered stable. It is possible decay may be observed in other nuclides, adding to this list of primordial radionuclides.
* Secondary radionuclides are radiogenic isotopes derived from the decay of primordial radionuclides. They have shorter half-lives than primordial radionuclides. They arise in the decay chain of the primordial isotopes thorium-232, uranium-238, and uranium-235. Examples include the natural isotopes of polonium and radium.
* Cosmogenic isotopes, such as carbon-14, are present because they are continually being formed in the atmosphere due to cosmic rays.

Many of these radionuclides exist only in trace amounts in nature, including all cosmogenic nuclides. Secondary radionuclides will occur in proportion to their half-lives, so short-lived ones will be very rare. For example, polonium can be found in uranium ores at about 0.1 mg per metric ton (1 part in 1010). Further radionuclides may occur in nature in virtually undetectable amounts as a result of rare events such as spontaneous fission or uncommon cosmic ray interactions.

===Nuclear fission===
Radionuclides are produced as an unavoidable result of nuclear fission and thermonuclear explosions. The process of nuclear fission creates a wide range of fission products, most of which are radionuclides. Further radionuclides can be created from irradiation of the nuclear fuel (creating a range of actinides) and of the surrounding structures, yielding activation products. This complex mixture of radionuclides with different chemistries and radioactivity makes handling nuclear waste and dealing with nuclear fallout particularly problematic.

===Synthetic===

Synthetic radionuclides are deliberately synthesised using nuclear reactors, particle accelerators or radionuclide generators:
* As well as being extracted from nuclear waste, radioisotopes can be produced deliberately with nuclear reactors, exploiting the high flux of neutrons present. These neutrons activate elements placed within the reactor. A typical product from a nuclear reactor is iridium-192. The elements that have a large propensity to take up the neutrons in the reactor are said to have a high neutron cross-section.
* Particle accelerators such as cyclotrons accelerate particles to bombard a target to produce radionuclides. Cyclotrons accelerate protons at a target to produce positron-emitting radionuclides, e.g. fluorine-18.
* Radionuclide generators contain a parent radionuclide that decays to produce a radioactive daughter. The parent is usually produced in a nuclear reactor. A typical example is the technetium-99m generator used in nuclear medicine. The parent produced in the reactor is molybdenum-99.

==Uses==
Radionuclides are used in two major ways: either for their radiation alone (irradiation, nuclear batteries) or for the combination of chemical properties and their radiation (tracers, biopharmaceuticals).
* In biology, radionuclides of carbon can serve as radioactive tracers because they are chemically very similar to the nonradioactive nuclides, so most chemical, biological, and ecological processes treat them in a nearly identical way. One can then examine the result with a radiation detector, such as a Geiger counter, to determine where the provided atoms were incorporated. For example, one might culture plants in an environment in which the carbon dioxide contained radioactive carbon; then the parts of the plant that incorporate atmospheric carbon would be radioactive. Radionuclides can be used to monitor processes such as DNA replication or amino acid transport.
* in physics and biology radionuclide X-ray fluorescence spectrometry is used to determine chemical composition of the compound. Radiation from a radionuclide source hits the sample and excites characteristic X-rays in the sample. This radiation is registered and the chemical composition of the sample can be determined from the analysis of the measured spectrum. By measuring the energy of the characteristic radiation lines, it is possible to determine the proton number of the chemical element that emits the radiation, and by measuring the number of emitted photons, it is possible to determine the concentration of individual chemical elements.
* In nuclear medicine, radioisotopes are used for diagnosis, treatment, and research. Radioactive chemical tracers emitting gamma rays or positrons can provide diagnostic information about internal anatomy and the functioning of specific organs, including the human brain. This is used in some forms of tomography: single-photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning and Cherenkov luminescence imaging. Radioisotopes are also a method of treatment in hemopoietic forms of tumors; the success for treatment of solid tumors has been limited. More powerful gamma sources sterilise syringes and other medical equipment.
* In food preservation, radiation is used to stop the sprouting of root crops after harvesting, to kill parasites and pests, and to control the ripening of stored fruit and vegetables. Food irradiation usually uses beta-decaying nuclides with strong gamma emissions like cobalt-60 or caesium-137.
* In industry, and in mining, radionuclides are used to examine welds, to detect leaks, to study the rate of wear, erosion and corrosion of metals, and for on-stream analysis of a wide range of minerals and fuels.
* In spacecraft, radionuclides are used to provide power and heat, notably through radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) and radioisotope heater units (RHUs).
* In astronomy and cosmology, radionuclides play a role in understanding stellar and planetary process.
* In particle physics, radionuclides help discover new physics (physics beyond the Standard Model) by measuring the energy and momentum of their beta decay products (for example, neutrinoless double beta decay and the search for weakly interacting massive particles).
* In ecology, radionuclides are used to trace and analyze pollutants, to study the movement of surface water, and to measure water runoffs from rain and snow, as well as the flow rates of streams and rivers.
* In geology, archaeology, and paleontology, natural radionuclides are used to measure ages of rocks, minerals, and fossil materials.

==Examples==

===Household smoke detectors===


Radionuclides are present in many homes as they are used inside the most common household smoke detectors. The radionuclide used is americium-241, which is created by bombarding plutonium with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. It decays by emitting alpha particles and gamma radiation to become neptunium-237. Smoke detectors use a very small quantity of 241Am (about 0.29 micrograms per smoke detector) in the form of americium dioxide. 241Am is used as it emits alpha particles which ionize the air in the detector&#x27;s ionization chamber. A small electric voltage is applied to the ionized air which gives rise to a small electric current. In the presence of smoke, some of the ions are neutralized, thereby decreasing the current, which activates the detector&#x27;s alarm.

==Impacts on organisms==
Radionuclides that find their way into the environment may cause harmful effects as radioactive contamination. They can also cause damage if they are excessively used during treatment or in other ways exposed to living beings, by radiation poisoning. Potential health damage from exposure to radionuclides depends on a number of factors, and &quot;can damage the functions of healthy tissue/organs. Radiation exposure can produce effects ranging from skin redness and hair loss, to radiation burns and acute radiation syndrome. Prolonged exposure can lead to cells being damaged and in turn lead to cancer. Signs of cancerous cells might not show up until years, or even decades, after exposure.&quot;

==Summary table for classes of nuclides, stable and radioactive==
Following is a summary table for the list of 989 nuclides with half-lives greater than one hour. A total of 251 nuclides have never been observed to decay, and are classically considered stable. Of these, 90 are believed to be absolutely stable except to proton decay (which has never been observed), while the rest are &quot;observationally stable&quot; and theoretically can undergo radioactive decay with extremely long half-lives.

The remaining tabulated radionuclides have half-lives longer than 1 hour, and are well-characterized (see list of nuclides for a complete tabulation). They include 30 nuclides with measured half-lives longer than the estimated age of the universe (13.8 billion years), and another four nuclides with half-lives long enough (&gt; 100 million years) that they are radioactive primordial nuclides, and may be detected on Earth, having survived from their presence in interstellar dust since before the formation of the Solar System, about 4.6 billion years ago. Another 60+ short-lived nuclides can be detected naturally as daughters of longer-lived nuclides or cosmic-ray products. The remaining known nuclides are known solely from artificial nuclear transmutation.

Numbers are not exact, and may change slightly in the future, as &quot;stable nuclides&quot; are observed to be radioactive with very long half-lives.

This is a summary table for the 989 nuclides with half-lives longer than one hour (including those that are stable), given in list of nuclides.
==List of commercially available radionuclides==

This list covers common isotopes, most of which are available in very small quantities to the general public in most countries. Others that are not publicly accessible are traded commercially in industrial, medical, and scientific fields and are subject to government regulation.

<doc id="37252" wikidata="Q189937" url="?curid=37252" title="John Knox">
<text>John Knox ( – 24 November 1572) was a Scottish minister, Reformed theologian, and writer who was a leader of the country&#x27;s Reformation. He was the founder of the Church of Scotland.

Born in Giffordgate, a street in Haddington, East Lothian, Knox is believed to have been educated at the University of St Andrews and worked as a notary-priest. Influenced by early church reformers such as George Wishart, he joined the movement to reform the Scottish Church. He was caught up in the and political events that involved the murder of Cardinal David Beaton in 1546 and the intervention of the regent Mary of Guise. He was taken prisoner by French forces the following year and exiled to England on his release in 1549.

While in exile, Knox was licensed to work in the Church of England, where he rose in the ranks to serve King Edward VI of England as a royal chaplain. He exerted a reforming influence on the text of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. In England, he met and married his first wife, Margery Bowes. When Mary I ascended the throne of England and re-established Catholicism, Knox was forced to resign his position and leave the country. Knox moved to Geneva and then to Frankfurt. In Geneva, he met John Calvin, from whom he gained experience and knowledge of Reformed theology and Presbyterian polity. He created a new order of service, The Forme of Prayers, which was eventually adopted by the Reformed Church in Scotland and came to be known as the &quot;Book of Common Order&quot;. He left Geneva to head the English refugee church in Frankfurt but he was forced to leave over differences concerning the liturgy, thus ending his association with the Church of England. The University of Edinburgh Heritage Collection holds a copy of &quot;The Book of Common Order&quot;, translated into Scots Gaelic by John Carswell. It is the first book printed in any Gaelic language.

On his return to Scotland, Knox led the Protestant Reformation in Scotland, in partnership with the Scottish Protestant nobility. The movement may be seen as a revolution since it led to the ousting of Mary of Guise, who governed the country in the name of her young daughter Mary, Queen of Scots. Knox helped write the new confession of faith and the ecclesiastical order for the newly created Reformed Church, the Kirk. He wrote his five-volume &quot;The History of the Reformation in Scotland&quot; between 1559 and 1566. He continued to serve as the religious leader of the Protestants throughout Mary&#x27;s reign. In several interviews with the Queen, Knox admonished her for supporting Catholic practices. After she was imprisoned for her alleged role in the murder of her husband Lord Darnley, and King James VI was enthroned in her stead, Knox openly called for her execution. He continued to preach until his final days.

==Early life, 1505–1546==
John Knox was born sometime between 1505 and 1515 in or near Haddington, the county town of East Lothian. His father, William Knox, was a merchant. All that is known of his mother is that her maiden name was Sinclair and that she died when John Knox was a child. Their eldest son, William, carried on his father&#x27;s business, which helped in Knox&#x27;s international communications.

Knox was probably educated at the grammar school in Haddington. At this time, the priesthood was the only path for those whose inclinations were academic rather than mercantile or agricultural. He proceeded to further studies at the University of St Andrews or possibly at the University of Glasgow. He studied under John Major, one of the greatest scholars of the time. Knox was ordained a Catholic priest in Edinburgh on Easter Eve of 1536 by William Chisholm, Bishop of Dunblane.

Knox first appears in public records as a priest and a notary in 1540. He was still serving in these capacities as late as 1543 when he described himself as a &quot;minister of the sacred altar in the diocese of St Andrews, notary by apostolic authority&quot; in a notarial deed dated 27 March. Rather than taking up parochial duties in a parish, he became tutor to two sons of Hugh Douglas of Longniddry. He also taught the son of John Cockburn of Ormiston. Both of these lairds had embraced the new religious ideas of the Reformation.

==Embracing the Protestant Reformation, 1546–1547==
Knox did not record when or how he was converted to the Protestant faith, but perhaps the key formative influences on Knox were Patrick Hamilton and George Wishart. Wishart was a reformer who had fled Scotland in 1538 to escape punishment for heresy. He first moved to England, where in Bristol he preached against the veneration of the Virgin Mary. He was forced to make a public recantation and was burned in effigy at the Church of St Nicholas as a sign of his abjuration. He then took refuge in Germany and Switzerland. While on the Continent, he translated the First Helvetic Confession into English. He returned to Scotland in 1544, but the timing of his return was unfortunate. In December 1543, James Hamilton, Duke of Châtellerault, the appointed regent for the infant Mary, Queen of Scots, had decided with the Queen Mother, Mary of Guise, and Cardinal David Beaton to persecute the Protestant sect that had taken root in Scotland. Wishart travelled throughout Scotland preaching in favour of the Reformation, and when he arrived in East Lothian, Knox became one of his closest associates. Knox acted as his bodyguard, bearing a two-handed sword in order to defend him. In December 1545, Wishart was seized on Beaton&#x27;s orders by the Earl of Bothwell and taken to the Castle of St Andrews. Knox was present on the night of Wishart&#x27;s arrest and was prepared to follow him into captivity, but Wishart persuaded him against this course saying, &quot;Nay, return to your bairns [children] and God bless you. One is sufficient for a sacrifice.&quot; Wishart was subsequently prosecuted by Beaton&#x27;s Public Accuser of Heretics, Archdeacon John Lauder. On 1 March 1546, he was burnt at the stake in the presence of Beaton.
Knox had avoided being arrested by Lord Bothwell through Wishart&#x27;s advice to return to tutoring. He took shelter with Douglas in Longniddry. Several months later he was still in charge of the pupils, the sons of Douglas and Cockburn, who wearied of moving from place to place while being pursued. He toyed with the idea of fleeing to Germany and taking his pupils with him. While Knox remained a fugitive, Beaton was murdered on 29 May 1546, within his residence, the Castle of St Andrews, by a gang of five persons in revenge for Wishart&#x27;s execution. The assassins seized the castle and eventually their families and friends took refuge with them, about a hundred and fifty men in all. Among their friends was Henry Balnaves, a former secretary of state in the government, who negotiated with England for the financial support of the rebels. Douglas and Cockburn suggested to Knox to take their sons to the relative safety of the castle to continue their instruction in reformed doctrine, and Knox arrived at the castle on 10 April 1547.

Knox&#x27;s powers as a preacher came to the attention of the chaplain of the garrison, John Rough. While Rough was preaching in the parish church on the Protestant principle of the popular election of a pastor, he proposed Knox to the congregation for that office. Knox did not relish the idea. According to his own account, he burst into tears and fled to his room. Within a week, however, he was giving his first sermon to a congregation that included his old teacher, John Major. He expounded on the seventh chapter of the Book of Daniel, comparing the Pope with the Antichrist. His sermon was marked by his consideration of the Bible as his sole authority and the doctrine of justification by faith alone, two elements that would remain in his thoughts throughout the rest of his life. A few days later, a debate was staged that allowed him to lay down additional theses including the rejection of the Mass, Purgatory, and prayers for the dead.

==Confinement in the French galleys, 1547–1549==
John Knox&#x27;s chaplaincy of the castle garrison was not to last long. While Hamilton was willing to negotiate with England to stop their support of the rebels and bring the castle back under his control, Mary of Guise decided that it could be taken only by force and requested the king of France, Henry II to intervene. On 29 June 1547, 21 French galleys approached St Andrews under the command of Leone Strozzi, prior of Capua. The French besieged the castle and forced the surrender of the garrison on 31 July. The Protestant nobles and others, including Knox, were taken prisoner and forced to row in the French galleys. The galley slaves were chained to benches and rowed throughout the day without a change of posture while an officer watched over them with a whip in hand. They sailed to France and navigated up the Seine to Rouen. The nobles, some of whom would have a bearing on Knox&#x27;s later life such as William Kirkcaldy and Henry Balnaves, were sent to various castle-prisons in France. Knox and the other galley slaves continued to Nantes and stayed on the Loire throughout the winter. They were threatened with torture if they did not give proper signs of reverence when mass was performed on the ship. Knox recounted an incident in which one of the prisoners—possibly himself, as Knox tended to narrate personal anecdotes in the third person—was required to show devotion to a picture of the Virgin Mary. The prisoner was told to give it a kiss of veneration. He refused and when the picture was pushed up to his face, the prisoner seized the picture and threw it into the sea, saying, &quot;Let our Lady now save herself: she is light enough: let her learn to swim.&quot; After that, according to Knox, the Scottish prisoners were no longer forced to perform such devotions.

In summer 1548, the galleys returned to Scotland to scout for English ships. Knox&#x27;s health was now at its lowest point due to the severity of his confinement. He was ill with a fever and others on the ship were afraid for his life. Even in this state, Knox recalled, his mind remained sharp and he comforted his fellow prisoners with hopes of release. While the ships were lying offshore between St Andrews and Dundee, the spires of the parish church where he preached appeared in view. James Balfour, a fellow prisoner, asked Knox whether he recognised the landmark. He replied that he knew it well, recognising the steeple of the place where he first preached and he declared that he would not die until he had preached there again.

In February 1549, after spending a total of 19 months in the galley-prison, Knox was released. It is uncertain how he obtained his liberty. Later in the year, Henry II arranged with Edward VI of England the release of all remaining Castilian prisoners.

==Exile in England, 1549–1554==
On his release, Knox took refuge in England. The Reformation in England was a less radical movement than its Continental counterparts, but there was a definite breach with Rome. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, and the regent of King Edward VI, the Duke of Somerset, were decidedly Protestant-minded. However, much work remained to bring reformed ideas to the clergy and to the people. On 7 April 1549, Knox was licensed to work in the Church of England. His first commission was in Berwick-upon-Tweed. He was obliged to use the recently released 1549 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, which maintained the structure of the Sarum Rite while adapting the content to the doctrine of the reformed Church of England. Knox, however, modified its use to accord with the doctrinal emphases of the Continental reformers. In the pulpit, he preached Protestant doctrines with great effect as his congregation grew. 
In England, Knox met his wife, Margery Bowes (died ). Her father, Richard Bowes (died 1558), was a descendant of an old Durham family and her mother, Elizabeth Aske, was an heiress of a Yorkshire family, the Askes of Richmondshire. Elizabeth presumably met Knox when he was employed in Berwick. Several letters reveal a close friendship between them. It is not recorded when Knox married Margery Bowes. Knox attempted to obtain the consent of the Bowes family, but her father and her brother Robert Bowes were opposed to the marriage.

Towards the end of 1550, Knox was appointed a preacher of St Nicholas&#x27; Church in Newcastle upon Tyne. The following year he was appointed one of the six royal chaplains serving the King. On 16 October 1551, John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, overthrew the Duke of Somerset to become the new regent of the young King. Knox condemned the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in a sermon on All Saints Day. When Dudley visited Newcastle and listened to his preaching in June 1552, he had mixed feelings about the firebrand preacher, but he saw Knox as a potential asset. Knox was asked to come to London to preach before the Court. In his first sermon, he advocated a change for the 1552 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. The liturgy required worshippers to kneel during communion. Knox and the other chaplains considered this to be idolatry. It triggered a debate where Archbishop Cranmer was called upon to defend the practice. The result was a compromise in which the famous Black Rubric, which declared that no adoration is intended while kneeling, was included in the second edition.

Soon afterwards, Dudley, who saw Knox as a useful political tool, offered him the bishopric of Rochester. Knox refused, and he returned to Newcastle. On 2 February 1553 Cranmer was ordered to appoint Knox as vicar of All Hallows, Bread Street, in London, placing him under the authority of the Bishop of London, Nicholas Ridley. Knox returned to London in order to deliver a sermon before the King and the Court during Lent and he again refused to take the assigned post. Knox was then told to preach in Buckinghamshire and he remained there until Edward&#x27;s death on 6 July. Edward&#x27;s successor, Mary Tudor, re-established Roman Catholicism in England and restored the Mass in all the churches. With the country no longer safe for Protestant preachers, Knox left for the Continent in January 1554 on the advice of friends. On the eve of his flight, he wrote:

Sometime I have thought that impossible it had been, so to have removed my affection from the realm of Scotland, that any realm or nation could have been equal dear to me. But God I take to record in my conscience, that the troubles present (and appearing to be) in the realm of England are double more dolorous unto my heart than ever were the troubles of Scotland.

==From Geneva to Frankfurt and Scotland, 1554–1556==
Knox disembarked in Dieppe, France, and continued to Geneva, where John Calvin had established his authority. When Knox arrived Calvin was in a difficult position. He had recently overseen the Company of Pastors, which prosecuted charges of heresy against the scholar Michael Servetus, although Calvin himself was not capable of voting for or against a civil penalty against Servetus. Knox asked Calvin four difficult political questions: whether a minor could rule by divine right, whether a female could rule and transfer sovereignty to her husband, whether people should obey ungodly or idolatrous rulers, and what party godly persons should follow if they resisted an idolatrous ruler. Calvin gave cautious replies and referred him to the Swiss reformer Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich. Bullinger&#x27;s responses were equally cautious, but Knox had already made up his mind. On 20 July 1554, he published a pamphlet attacking Mary Tudor and the bishops who had brought her to the throne. He also attacked the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, calling him &quot;no less enemy to Christ than was Nero&quot;.

In a letter dated 24 September 1554, Knox received an invitation from a congregation of English exiles in Frankfurt to become one of their ministers. He accepted the call with Calvin&#x27;s blessing. But no sooner had he arrived than he found himself in a conflict. The first set of refugees to arrive in Frankfurt had subscribed to a reformed liturgy and used a modified version of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. More recently arrived refugees, however, including Edmund Grindal, the future Archbishop of Canterbury, favoured a stricter application of the book. When Knox and a supporting colleague, William Whittingham, wrote to Calvin for advice, they were told to avoid contention. Knox therefore agreed on a temporary order of service based on a compromise between the two sides. This delicate balance was disturbed when a new batch of refugees arrived that included Richard Cox, one of the principal authors of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. Cox brought Knox&#x27;s pamphlet attacking the emperor to the attention of the Frankfurt authorities, who advised that Knox leave. His departure from Frankfurt on 26 March 1555 marked his final breach with the Church of England.

After his return to Geneva, Knox was chosen to be the minister at a new place of worship petitioned from Calvin. As such, he exerted an influence on French Protestants, whether they were exiled in Geneva or in France. In the meantime, Elizabeth Bowes wrote to Knox, asking him to return to Margery in Scotland, which he did at the end of August. Despite initial doubts about the state of the Reformation in Scotland, Knox found the country significantly changed since he was carried off in the galley in 1547. When he toured various parts of Scotland preaching the reformed doctrines and liturgy, he was welcomed by many of the nobility including two future regents of Scotland, the Earl of Moray and the Earl of Mar.

Though the Queen Regent, Mary of Guise, made no move against Knox, his activities caused concern among the church authorities. The bishops of Scotland viewed him as a threat to their authority and summoned him to appear in Edinburgh on 15 May 1556. He was accompanied to the trial by so many influential persons that the bishops decided to call the hearing off. Knox was now free to preach openly in Edinburgh. William Keith, the Earl Marischal, was impressed and urged Knox to write to the Queen Regent. Knox&#x27;s unusually respectful letter urged her to support the Reformation and overthrow the church hierarchy. Queen Mary took the letter as a joke and ignored it.

==Return to Geneva, 1556–1559==
Shortly after Knox sent the letter to the Queen Regent, he suddenly announced that he felt his duty was to return to Geneva. In the previous year on 1 November 1555, the congregation in Geneva had elected Knox as their minister and he decided to take up the post. He wrote a final letter of advice to his supporters and left Scotland with his wife and mother-in-law. He arrived in Geneva on 13 September 1556.

For the next two years, he lived a happy life in Geneva. He recommended Geneva to his friends in England as the best place of asylum for Protestants. In one letter he wrote:

I neither fear nor eschame to say, is the most perfect school of Christ that ever was in the earth since the days of the apostles. In other places I confess Christ to be truly preached; but manners and religion so sincerely reformed, I have not yet seen in any other place ...

Knox led a busy life in Geneva. He preached three sermons a week, each lasting well over two hours. The services used a liturgy that was derived by Knox and other ministers from Calvin&#x27;s &quot;Formes des Prières Ecclésiastiques&quot;. The church in which he preached, the &quot;Église de Notre Dame la Neuve&quot;—now known as the Auditoire de Calvin—had been granted by the municipal authorities, at Calvin&#x27;s request, for the use of the English and Italian congregations. Knox&#x27;s two sons, Nathaniel and Eleazar, were born in Geneva, with Whittingham and Myles Coverdale their respective godfathers.

In the summer of 1558, Knox published his best-known pamphlet, &quot;The first blast of the trumpet against the monstruous regiment of women&quot;. In calling the &quot;regimen&quot; or rule of women &quot;monstruous&quot;, he meant that it was &quot;unnatural&quot;. Knox states that his purpose was to demonstrate &quot;how abominable before God is the Empire or Rule of a wicked woman, yea, of a traiteresse and bastard&quot;. The women rulers that Knox had in mind were Queen Mary I of England and Mary of Guise, the Dowager Queen of Scotland and regent on behalf of her daughter, Mary, Queen of Scots. This biblical position was not unusual in Knox&#x27;s day; however, even he was aware that the pamphlet was dangerously seditious. He therefore published it anonymously and did not tell Calvin, who denied knowledge of it until a year after its publication, that he had written it. In England, the pamphlet was officially condemned by royal proclamation. The impact of the document was complicated later that year when Elizabeth Tudor, a Protestant, became Queen of England. Although Knox had not targeted Elizabeth, he had deeply offended her, and she never forgave him.

With a Protestant on the throne, the English refugees in Geneva prepared to return home. Knox himself decided to return to Scotland. Before his departure, various honours were conferred on him, including the freedom of the city of Geneva. Knox left in January 1559, but he did not arrive in Scotland until 2 May 1559, owing to Elizabeth&#x27;s refusal to issue him a passport through England.

==Revolution and end of the regency, 1559–1560==
Two days after Knox arrived in Edinburgh, he proceeded to Dundee where a large number of Protestant sympathisers had gathered. Knox was declared an outlaw, and the Queen Regent summoned the Protestants to Stirling. Fearing the possibility of a summary trial and execution, the Protestants proceeded instead to Perth, a walled town that could be defended in case of a siege. At the church of St John the Baptist, Knox preached a fiery sermon and a small incident precipitated into a riot. A mob poured into the church and it was soon gutted. The mob then attacked two friaries (Blackfriars and Greyfriars) in the town, looting their gold and silver and smashing images. Mary of Guise gathered those nobles loyal to her and a small French army. She dispatched the Earl of Argyll and Lord Moray to offer terms and avert a war. She promised not to send any French troops into Perth if the Protestants evacuated the town. The Protestants agreed, but when the Queen Regent entered Perth, she garrisoned it with Scottish soldiers on the French payroll. This was seen as treacherous by Lord Argyll and Lord Moray, who both switched sides and joined Knox, who now based himself in St Andrews. Knox&#x27;s return to St Andrews fulfilled the prophecy he made in the galleys that he would one day preach again in its church. When he did give a sermon, the effect was the same as in Perth. The people engaged in vandalism and looting. In June 1559, a Protestant mob incited by the preaching of John Knox ransacked the cathedral; the interior of the building was destroyed. The cathedral fell into decline following the attack and became a source of building material for the town. By 1561 it had been abandoned and left to fall into ruin.

With Protestant reinforcements arriving from neighbouring counties, the Queen Regent retreated to Dunbar. By now, the mob fury had spilled over central Scotland. Her own troops were on the verge of mutiny. On 30 June, the Protestant Lords of the Congregation occupied Edinburgh, though they were able to hold it for only a month. But even before their arrival, the mob had already sacked the churches and the friaries. On 1 July, Knox preached from the pulpit of St Giles&#x27;, the most influential in the capital. The Lords of the Congregation negotiated their withdrawal from Edinburgh by the Articles of Leith signed 25 July 1559, and Mary of Guise promised freedom of conscience.

Knox knew that the Queen Regent would ask for help from France, so he negotiated by letter under the assumed name John Sinclair with William Cecil, Elizabeth&#x27;s chief adviser, for English support. Knox sailed secretly to Lindisfarne, off the northeast coast of England at the end of July, to meet James Croft and Sir Henry Percy at Berwick upon Tweed. Knox was indiscreet and news of his mission soon reached Mary of Guise. He returned to Edinburgh telling Croft he had to return to his flock, and suggested that Henry Balnaves should go to Cecil.

When additional French troops arrived in Leith, Edinburgh&#x27;s seaport, the Protestants responded by retaking Edinburgh. This time, on 24 October 1559, the Scottish nobility formally deposed Mary of Guise from the regency. Her secretary, William Maitland of Lethington, defected to the Protestant side, bringing his administrative skills. From then on, Maitland took over the political tasks, freeing Knox for the role of religious leader. For the final stage of the revolution, Maitland appealed to Scottish patriotism to fight French domination. Following the Treaty of Berwick, support from England finally arrived and by the end of March, a significant English army joined the Scottish Protestant forces. The sudden death of Mary of Guise in Edinburgh Castle on 10 June 1560 paved the way for an end to hostilities, the signing of the Treaty of Edinburgh, and the withdrawal of French and English troops from Scotland. On 19 July, Knox held a National Thanksgiving Service at St Giles&#x27;.

==Reformation in Scotland, 1560–1561==

On 1 August, the Scottish Parliament met to settle religious issues. Knox and five other ministers, all called John, were called upon to draw up a new confession of faith. Within four days, the Scots Confession was presented to Parliament, voted upon, and approved. A week later, the Parliament passed three acts in one day: the first abolished the jurisdiction of the Pope in Scotland, the second condemned all doctrine and practice contrary to the reformed faith, and the third forbade the celebration of Mass in Scotland. Before the dissolution of Parliament, Knox and the other ministers were given the task of organising the newly reformed church or the Kirk. They would work for several months on the &quot;Book of Discipline&quot;, the document describing the organisation of the new church. During this period, in December 1560, Knox&#x27;s wife, Margery, died, leaving Knox to care for their two sons, aged three and a half and two years old. John Calvin, who had lost his own wife in 1549, wrote a letter of condolence.

Parliament reconvened on 15 January 1561 to consider the &quot;Book of Discipline&quot;. The Kirk was to be run on democratic lines. Each congregation was free to choose or reject its own pastor, but once he was chosen he could not be fired. Each parish was to be self-supporting, as far as possible. The bishops were replaced by ten to twelve &quot;superintendents&quot;. The plan included a system of national education based on universality as a fundamental principle. Certain areas of law were placed under ecclesiastical authority. The Parliament did not approve the plan, however, mainly for reasons of finance. The Kirk was to be financed out of the patrimony of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland. Much of this was now in the hands of the nobles, who were reluctant to give up their possessions. A final decision on the plan was delayed because of the impending return of Mary, Queen of Scots.

==Knox and Queen Mary, 1561–1564==
On 19 August 1561, cannons were fired in Leith to announce Queen Mary&#x27;s arrival in Scotland. When she attended Mass being celebrated in the royal chapel at Holyrood Palace five days later, this prompted a protest in which one of her servants was jostled. The next day she issued a proclamation that there would be no alteration in the current state of religion and that her servants should not be molested or troubled. Many nobles accepted this, but not Knox. The following Sunday, he protested from the pulpit of St Giles&#x27;. As a result, just two weeks after her return, Mary summoned Knox. She accused him of inciting a rebellion against her mother and of writing a book against her own authority. Knox answered that as long as her subjects found her rule convenient, he was willing to accept her governance, noting that Paul the Apostle had been willing to live under Nero&#x27;s rule. Mary noted, however, that he had written against the principle of female rule itself. He responded that she should not be troubled by what had never harmed her. When Mary asked him whether subjects had a right to resist their ruler, he replied that if monarchs exceeded their lawful limits, they might be resisted, even by force.

On 13 December 1562, Mary sent for Knox again after he gave a sermon denouncing certain celebrations which Knox had interpreted as rejoicing at the expense of the Reformation. She charged that Knox spoke irreverently of the Queen in order to make her appear contemptible to her subjects. After Knox gave an explanation of the sermon, Mary stated that she did not blame Knox for the differences of opinion and asked that in the future he come to her directly if he heard anything about her that he disliked. Despite her gesture, Knox replied that he would continue to voice his convictions in his sermons and would not wait upon her.

During Easter in 1563, some priests in Ayrshire celebrated Mass, thus defying the law. Some Protestants tried to enforce the law themselves by apprehending these priests. This prompted Mary to summon Knox for the third time. She asked Knox to use his influence to promote religious toleration. He defended their actions and noted she was bound to uphold the laws and if she did not, others would. Mary surprised Knox by agreeing that the priests would be brought to justice.

The most dramatic interview between Mary and Knox took place on 24 June 1563. Mary summoned Knox to Holyrood after hearing that he had been preaching against her proposed marriage to Don Carlos, the son of Philip II of Spain. Mary began by scolding Knox, then she burst into tears. &quot;What have ye to do with my marriage?&quot; she asked, and &quot;What are ye within this commonwealth?&quot; &quot;A subject born within the same, Madam,&quot; Knox replied. He noted that though he was not of noble birth, he had the same duty as any subject to warn of dangers to the realm. When Mary started to cry again, he said, &quot;Madam, in God&#x27;s presence I speak: I never delighted in the weeping of any of God&#x27;s creatures; yea I can scarcely well abide the tears of my own boys whom my own hand corrects, much less can I rejoice in your Majesty&#x27;s weeping.&quot; He added that he would rather endure her tears, however, than remain silent and &quot;betray my Commonwealth&quot;. At this, Mary ordered him out of the room.

Knox&#x27;s final encounter with Mary was prompted by an incident at Holyrood. While Mary was absent from Edinburgh on her summer progress in 1563, a crowd forced its way into her private chapel as Mass was being celebrated. During the altercation, the priest&#x27;s life was threatened. As a result, two of the ringleaders, burgesses of Edinburgh, were scheduled for trial on 24 October 1563. In order to defend these men, Knox sent out letters calling the nobles to convene. Mary obtained one of these letters and asked her advisors if this was not a treasonable act. Stewart and Maitland, wanting to keep good relations with both the Kirk and the Queen, asked Knox to admit he was wrong and to settle the matter quietly. Knox refused and he defended himself in front of Mary and the Privy Council. He argued that he had called a legal, not an illegal, assembly as part of his duties as a minister of the Kirk. After he left, the councillors voted not to charge him with treason.

==Final years in Edinburgh, 1564–1572==
On 26 March 1564, Knox stirred controversy again when he married Margaret Stewart, the daughter of an old friend, Andrew Stewart, 2nd Lord Ochiltree, a member of the Stuart family and a distant relative of the Queen, Mary Stuart. The marriage was unusual because he was a widower of fifty, while the bride was only seventeen. Very few details are known of their domestic life. They had three daughters, Martha, Margaret, and Elizabeth.

When the General Assembly convened in June 1564, an argument broke out between Knox and Maitland over the authority of the civil government. Maitland told Knox to refrain from stirring up emotions over Mary&#x27;s insistence on having mass celebrated and he quoted from Martin Luther and John Calvin about obedience to earthly rulers. Knox retorted that the Bible notes that Israel was punished when it followed an unfaithful king and that the Continental reformers were refuting arguments made by the Anabaptists who rejected all forms of government. The debate revealed his waning influence on political events as the nobility continued to support Mary.

After the wedding of Mary and Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley on 29 July 1565, some of the Protestant nobles, including James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray, rose up in a rebellion known as the &quot;Chaseabout Raid&quot;. Knox revealed his own objection to the marriage while preaching in the presence of the new King Consort on 19 August 1565. He made passing allusions to ungodly rulers which caused Darnley to walk out. Knox was summoned and prohibited from preaching while the court was in Edinburgh.
On 9 March 1566, Mary&#x27;s secretary, David Rizzio, was murdered by conspirators loyal to Darnley. Mary escaped from Edinburgh to Dunbar and by 18 March returned with a formidable force. Knox fled to Kyle in Ayrshire, where he completed the major part of his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;History of the Reformation in Scotland&quot;. When he returned to Edinburgh, he found the Protestant nobles divided over what to do with Mary. Lord Darnley had been murdered and the Queen almost immediately married the chief suspect, the Earl of Bothwell. The indictment of murder thus upon her, she was forced to abdicate and was imprisoned in Lochleven Castle. Lord Moray had become the regent of King James VI. Other old friends of Knox, Lord Argyll and William Kirkcaldy, stood by Mary. On 29 July 1567, Knox preached James VI&#x27;s coronation sermon at the church of the Holy Rude in Stirling. During this period Knox thundered against her in his sermons, even to the point of calling for her death. However, Mary&#x27;s life was spared, and she escaped on 2 May 1568.

The fighting in Scotland continued as a civil war. Lord Moray was assassinated on 23 January 1570. The regent who succeeded him, the Earl of Lennox, was also a victim of violence. On 30 April 1571, the controller of Edinburgh Castle, Kirkcaldy of Grange, ordered all enemies of the Queen to leave the city. But for Knox, his former friend and fellow galley slave, he made an exception. If Knox did not leave, he could stay in Edinburgh, but only if he remained captive in the castle. Knox chose to leave, and on 5 May he left for St Andrews. He continued to preach, spoke to students, and worked on his &quot;History&quot;. At the end of July 1572, after a truce was called, he returned to Edinburgh. Although by this time exceedingly feeble and his voice faint, he continued to preach at St Giles&#x27;.

After inducting his successor, James Lawson of Aberdeen, as minister of St Giles&#x27; on 9 November, Knox returned to his home for the last time. With his friends and some of the greatest Scottish nobles around him, he asked for the Bible to be read aloud. On his last day, 24 November 1572, his young wife read from Paul&#x27;s first letter to the Corinthians. A testimony to Knox was pronounced at his grave in the churchyard of St Giles&#x27; by James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton, and newly elected regent of Scotland: &quot;Here lies one who never feared any flesh&quot;. After the churchyard&#x27;s destruction in 1633 the precise site of Knox&#x27;s grave cannot be established.

==Legacy==

In his will, Knox claimed: &quot;None have I corrupted, none have I defrauded; merchandise have I not made.&quot; The paltry sum of money Knox bequeathed to his family, which would have left them in dire poverty, showed that he had not profited from his work in the Kirk. The regent, Lord Morton, asked the General Assembly to continue paying his stipend to his widow for one year after his death, and the regent ensured that Knox&#x27;s dependents were decently supported.

Knox was survived by his five children and his second wife. Nathaniel and Eleazar, his two sons by his first wife, attended St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. Nathaniel became a Fellow of St John&#x27;s but died early in 1580. Eleazar was ordained into the Church of England and served in the parish of Great Clacton. He also died young and was buried in the chapel of St John&#x27;s College in 1591. Knox&#x27;s second wife, Margaret Knox, married a second time, to Andrew Ker, who was one of those involved in the murder of David Rizzio. Knox&#x27;s three daughters also married: Martha to Alexander Fairlie; Margaret to Zachary Pont, son of Robert Pont and brother of Timothy Pont; and Elizabeth to John Welsh, a minister of the Kirk.

Knox&#x27;s death was barely noticed at the time. Although his funeral was attended by the nobles of Scotland, no major politician or diplomat mentioned his death in their surviving letters. Mary, Queen of Scots, made only two brief references to him in her letters. However, what the rulers feared were Knox&#x27;s ideas more than Knox himself. He was a successful reformer and it was this philosophy of reformation that had a great impact on the English Puritans. He has also been described as having contributed to the struggle for genuine human freedom, by teaching a duty to oppose unjust government in order to bring about moral and spiritual change. His epitaph reads: &quot;Here lies one who feared God so much that he never feared the face of any man.&quot; This is a reference to Matthew 10:28.

Knox was notable not so much for the overthrow of Roman Catholicism in Scotland, but for assuring the replacement of the established Christian religion with Presbyterianism rather than Anglicanism. Knox was instrumental in the establishment of the Presbyterian polity, though it took 120 years following his death for this to be achieved in 1689. Meanwhile, he accepted the status quo and was happy to see his friends appointed bishops and archbishops, even preaching at the inauguration of the Protestant Archbishop of St Andrews John Douglas in 1571. In that regard, Knox is considered the notional founder of the Presbyterian denomination, whose members number millions worldwide.

A bust of Knox, by David Watson Stevenson, is in the Hall of Heroes of the National Wallace Monument in Stirling.

<doc id="37256" wikidata="Q930013" url="?curid=37256" title="Michael I of Romania">
<text>Michael I ( ; 25 October 1921 – 5 December 2017) was the last King of Romania, reigning from 20 July 1927 to 8 June 1930 and again from 6 September 1940 until his forced abdication on 30 December 1947.

Shortly after Michael&#x27;s birth, his father, Crown Prince Carol, had become involved in a controversial relationship with Magda Lupescu. In 1925, Carol was pressured to renounce his rights (in favour of his son Michael) to the throne and moved to Paris in exile with Lupescu. In July 1927, following the death of his grandfather Ferdinand I, Michael ascended the throne at age five, the youngest crowned head in Europe. As Michael was still a minor, a regency council was instituted, composed of his uncle Prince Nicolas, Patriarch Miron Cristea and Chief Justice Gheorghe Buzdugan. The council proved to be ineffective and, in 1930, Carol returned to Romania and replaced his son as monarch, reigning as Carol II. As a result, Michael returned to being heir apparent to the throne and was given the additional title of Grand Voievod of Alba-Iulia.

Carol II was forced to abdicate in 1940, and Michael once again became king. Under the government led by the military dictator Ion Antonescu, Romania became aligned with Nazi Germany. In 1944, Michael participated in a coup against Antonescu, appointed Constantin Sănătescu as his replacement, and subsequently declared an alliance with the Allies. In March 1945, political pressures forced Michael to appoint a pro-Soviet government headed by Petru Groza. From August 1945 to January 1946, Michael went on a &quot;royal strike&quot; and unsuccessfully tried to oppose Groza&#x27;s communist-controlled government by refusing to sign and endorse its decrees. In November 1947, Michael attended the wedding of his cousins, the future Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark in London. Shortly thereafter, on the morning of 30 December 1947, Groza met with Michael and compelled him to abdicate, while the monarchy was abolished. Michael was forced into exile, his properties confiscated, and his citizenship stripped. In 1948, he married Princess Anne of Bourbon-Parma, with whom he had five daughters. The couple eventually settled in Switzerland.

Nicolae Ceaușescu&#x27;s communist dictatorship was overthrown in December 1989 and the following year Michael attempted to return to Romania, only to be arrested and forced to leave upon arrival. In 1992, Michael was allowed to visit Romania for Easter, where he was greeted by huge crowds; a speech he gave from his hotel window drew an estimated one million people to Bucharest. Alarmed by Michael&#x27;s popularity, the post-communist government of Ion Iliescu refused to allow him any further visits. In 1997, after Iliescu&#x27;s defeat by Emil Constantinescu in the presidential election of the previous year, Michael&#x27;s citizenship was restored and he was allowed to visit Romania again. Several confiscated properties, such as Peleș Castle and Săvârșin Castle, were eventually returned to his family.

==Early life==

Michael was born in 1921 at Foișor Castle on the Royal Complex of Peleș in Sinaia, Romania, the son of Crown Prince Carol of Romania and Crown Princess Elena. He was born as the paternal grandson of the reigning King Ferdinand I of Romania and maternal grandson of the reigning King Constantine I of Greece.
When Carol eloped with his mistress Elena Magda Lupescu and renounced his rights to the throne in December 1925, Michael was declared heir apparent. Michael succeeded to the throne of Romania upon Ferdinand&#x27;s death in July 1927, before his sixth birthday. Later, Michael attended a special school established in 1932 by his father.

==Reign==
===1930s and the Antonescu era===

A regency, which included his uncle, Prince Nicolae, Patriarch Miron Cristea, and the country&#x27;s Chief Justice (Gheorghe Buzdugan, and from October 1929, ) functioned on behalf of the five-year-old Michael, when he succeeded Ferdinand in 1927. In 1930, Carol II returned to the country at the invitation of politicians dissatisfied with the regency in the context of the Great Depression, and was proclaimed king by the Parliament. Michael was demoted to crown prince with the title &quot;Grand Voivode of Alba Iulia&quot;. In November 1939, Michael joined the Romanian Senate, as the 1938 Constitution guaranteed him a seat there upon reaching the age of eighteen.

Just days after the Second Vienna Award, the pro-Nazi anti-Soviet regime of Prime Minister Marshal Ion Antonescu staged a coup d&#x27;état against Carol II, whom he claimed to be &quot;anti-German&quot;. Antonescu suspended the Constitution, dissolved the Parliament, and re-installed the 18-year-old Michael as king, by popular acclaim in September 1940. (Although the Constitution was restored in 1944, and the Romanian Parliament in 1946, Michael did not subsequently take a formal oath nor have his reign approved retroactively by Parliament.) Michael was crowned with the Steel Crown and anointed King of Romania by the Orthodox Patriarch of Romania, Nicodim Munteanu, in the Patriarchal Cathedral of Bucharest, on the day of his accession, 6 September 1940. Although King Michael was formally the Supreme Head of the Army, named &quot;Conducător&quot; (&quot;Leader of the people&quot;), and entitled to appoint the Prime Minister with full powers, in reality he was forced to remain a figurehead for most of the war, until August 1944. Michael had lunch with Adolf Hitler twice—once with his father in Bavaria in 1937, and with his mother in Berlin in 1941. He also met Benito Mussolini in Italy in 1941.

===Turning against Nazi Germany===
In 1944, World War II was going badly for the Axis powers, but Antonescu was still in control of Romania. By August 1944, the Soviet conquest of Romania had become inevitable, and was expected in a few months. On 23 August 1944, Michael joined the pro-Allies politicians, a number of army officers, and armed Communist-led civilians in staging a coup against Antonescu. Michael ordered his arrest by the Royal Palace Guard. On the same night, the new Prime Minister, Lt. General Constantin Sănătescu—appointed by King Michael—gave custody of Antonescu to the communists (in spite of alleged instructions to the contrary by the King), and the latter delivered him to the Soviets on 1 September. In a radio broadcast to the Romanian nation and army, Michael issued a ceasefire just as the Red Army was penetrating the Moldavian front, proclaimed Romania&#x27;s loyalty to the Allies, announced the acceptance of the armistice offered by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and declared war on Germany. However, this did not avert a rapid Soviet occupation and capture of about 130,000 Romanian soldiers, who were transported to the Soviet Union where many perished in prison camps.

Although the country&#x27;s alliance with Nazi Germany was ended, the coup sped the Red Army&#x27;s advance into Romania. The armistice was signed three weeks later on 12 September 1944, on terms the Soviets virtually dictated. Under the terms of the armistice, Romania recognized its defeat by the USSR and was placed under occupation of the Allied forces, with the Soviets, as their representative, in control of media, communication, post, and civil administration behind the front. The coup effectively amounted to a &quot;capitulation&quot;, an &quot;unconditional&quot; &quot;surrender&quot;. It has been suggested by Romanian historians that the coup may have shortened World War II by six months, thus saving hundreds of thousands of lives.

At the end of the war, King Michael was awarded the highest degree (Chief Commander) of the American Legion of Merit by U.S. President Harry S. Truman. He was also decorated with the Soviet Order of Victory by Joseph Stalin &quot;for the courageous act of the radical change in Romania&#x27;s politics towards a break-up from Hitler&#x27;s Germany and an alliance with the United Nations, at the moment when there was no clear sign yet of Germany&#x27;s defeat&quot;, according to the official description of the decoration. With the death of Michał Rola-Żymierski in 1989, Michael became the sole surviving recipient of the Order of Victory.

===Reign under Communism===
In March 1945, political pressures forced King Michael to appoint a pro-Soviet government headed by Petru Groza. For the next two-plus years, Michael functioned again as little more than a figurehead. Between August 1945 and January 1946, during what was later known as the &quot;royal strike&quot;, King Michael tried unsuccessfully to oppose the Groza government by refusing to sign its decrees. In response to Soviet, British, and American pressures, King Michael eventually gave up his opposition to the communist government and stopped demanding its resignation.

He did not pardon &quot;Mareșal&quot; Antonescu, the former Prime Minister, who was sentenced to death &quot;for betrayal of the Romanian people for the benefit of Nazi Germany, for the economic and political subjugation of Romania to Germany, for cooperation with the Iron Guard, for murdering his political opponents, for the mass murder of civilians and crimes against peace&quot;. Nor did King Michael manage to save such leaders of the opposition as Iuliu Maniu and the Bratianus, victims of Communist political trials, as the Constitution prevented him from doing so without the counter-signature of Communist Justice Minister Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu (who himself was later eliminated by Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s opposing Communist faction). The memoirs of King Michael&#x27;s aunt Princess Ileana quoted Emil Bodnăraș—her alleged lover, Romania&#x27;s Communist minister of defence, and a Soviet spy—as saying: &quot;Well, if the King decides not to sign the death warrant, I promise that we will uphold his point of view.&quot; Princess Ileana was sceptical: &quot;You know quite well (...) that the King will never of his free will sign such an unconstitutional document. If he does, it will be laid at your door, and before the whole nation your government will bear the blame. Surely you do not wish this additional handicap at this moment!&quot;

===Forced abdication===

In November 1947, King Michael travelled to London for the wedding of his cousins, Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II) and Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, an occasion during which he met Princess Anne of Bourbon-Parma (his second cousin once removed), who was to become his wife. According to his own account, King Michael rejected any offers of asylum and decided to return to Romania, contrary to the confidential, strong advice of the British Ambassador to Romania.

Early on the morning of 30 December 1947, Michael was preparing for a New Year&#x27;s party at Peleș Castle in Sinaia, when Groza summoned him back to Bucharest. Michael returned to Elisabeta Palace in Bucharest, to find it surrounded by troops from the Tudor Vladimirescu Division, an army unit completely loyal to the Communists. Groza and Communist Party leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej were waiting for him, and demanded that he sign a pre-typed instrument of abdication. Unable to call in loyal troops, due to his telephone lines allegedly being cut, Michael signed the document. Later the same day, the Communist-dominated government announced the abolition of the monarchy, and its replacement by a People&#x27;s Republic, broadcasting the King&#x27;s pre-recorded radio proclamation of his own abdication. On 3 January 1948, Michael was forced to leave the country, followed over a week later by Princesses Elisabeth and Ileana, who collaborated so closely with the Soviets that they became known as the King&#x27;s &quot;Red Aunts&quot;. He was the last monarch behind the Iron Curtain to lose his throne.

Michael&#x27;s own account of the abdication varied over time, and was gradually embellished, especially after 1990. Thus, in accounts published in 1950 and 1977, Michael only mentioned seeing armed groups with machine-guns on their shoulders around the palace, while in much later accounts these were described as &quot;heavy artillery, ready to fire at any moment&quot;. The story of the supposed blackmail also evolved: in the 1950 account, Groza tried to negotiate some form of material compensations for the abdication, noting he could not guarantee for Michael&#x27;s life in case he refused, and his refusal could lead to thousand of arrests and possibly a civil war; in a hearing before the United States House of Representatives in 1954, Michael mentioned Groza&#x27;s generic threats regarding his personal security, bloodshed and ruin of the country, as well as &quot;vague hints&quot; of persecution, with Groza suggesting the government had a large dossier on Michael; the possible arrest of thousands and a generic threat of bloodshed is also mentioned in the 1977 account; however, beginning with 1990, Michael claimed that Groza threatened to shoot 1,000 students that had already been arrested for publicly showing their attachment to the throne. Thus, while according to a &quot;Time&quot; article published in 1948, Groza threatened to arrest thousands of people and order a bloodbath unless Michael abdicated, in an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; from 2007, Michael recounted: &quot;It was blackmail. They said, &#x27;If you don&#x27;t sign this immediately we are obliged&#x27;—why obliged I don&#x27;t know—&#x27;to kill more than 1,000 students&#x27; that they had in prison.&quot; In historian Ioan Scurtu&#x27;s opinion, the new account was created in order to leverage the recent Revolution of 1989, presented at the time as a revolution of the youth and the students. Another new element in Michael&#x27;s account after 1990 was that Groza had threatened him at gunpoint; in earlier accounts Michael mentioned that Groza had shown him the pistol he was carrying only after Michael signed the abdication.

According to the autobiography of the former head of the Soviet intelligence agency NKVD, Major General Pavel Sudoplatov, the Deputy Soviet Foreign Commissar Andrey Vyshinsky personally conducted negotiations with King Michael for his abdication, guaranteeing part of a pension to be paid to Michael in Mexico. According to a few articles in &quot;Jurnalul Naţional&quot;, Michael&#x27;s abdication was negotiated with the Communist government, which allowed him to leave the country with the goods he requested, accompanied by some of the royal retinue.

According to Albanian Communist leader Enver Hoxha&#x27;s account of his conversations with the Romanian Communist leaders on the monarch&#x27;s abdication, it was Gheorghiu-Dej, not Groza, who forced Michael&#x27;s abdication at gunpoint. He was allowed to leave the country accompanied by some of his entourage and, as confirmed also by the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev recounting Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s confessions, with whatever properties he desired, including gold and rubies. Hoxha also wrote that pro-Communist troops surrounded the palace, to counter army units who were still loyal to the King.

In March 1948, Michael denounced his abdication as illegal, and contended he was still the rightful King of Romania. According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, he would have done so sooner, but for much of early 1948, he had been negotiating with the Communists over properties he had left in Romania.

There are reports that Romanian Communist authorities allowed King Michael to depart with 42 valuable Crown-owned paintings in November 1947, so that he would leave Romania faster. Some of these paintings were reportedly sold through the famed art dealer Daniel Wildenstein. One of the paintings belonging to the Romanian Crown, which was supposedly taken out of the country by King Michael in November 1947, returned to Romania in 2004 as a donation made by John Kreuger, the former husband of King Michael&#x27;s daughter Irina.

In 2005, Romanian Prime Minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu denied these accusations about King Michael, stating that the Romanian government has no proof of any such action by King Michael and that, prior to 1949, the government had no official records of any artwork taken over from the former royal residences. However, according to some historians, such records existed as early as April 1948, having been, in fact, officially published in June 1948.

According to Ivor Porter&#x27;s authorized biography, &quot;Michael of Romania: The King and The Country&quot; (2005), which quotes Queen Mother Helen&#x27;s daily diary, the Romanian royal family took out paintings belonging to the Romanian Royal Crown, on their November 1947 trip to London to the wedding of the future Queen Elizabeth II; two of these paintings, signed by El Greco, were sold in 1976.

According to declassified Foreign Office documents that were the subject of news reports in 2005, when he left Romania, the exiled King Michael&#x27;s only assets amounted to 500,000 Swiss francs. Recently declassified Soviet transcripts of talks between Joseph Stalin and the Romanian Prime Minister Petru Groza show that shortly before his abdication, King Michael received from the communist government assets amounting to 500,000 Swiss francs. King Michael, however, repeatedly denied that the Communist government had allowed him to take into exile any financial assets or valuable goods besides four personal automobiles loaded on two train cars.

==Marriage==

===Engagement===
In November 1947, Michael I met a distant relative, Princess Anne of Bourbon-Parma who was visiting London for the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten, Duke of Edinburgh. In fact, a year previously Queen Helen, The Queen Mother had invited Anne, her mother, and brothers for a visit to Bucharest, but the plan did not come off. Meanwhile, King Michael I had glimpsed Princess Anne in a newsreel and requested a photograph from the film footage.

She did not want to accompany her parents to London for the royal wedding as she wished to avoid meeting Michael I in official surroundings. Instead, she planned to stay behind, go alone to the Paris railway station and, pretending to be a passerby in the crowd, privately observe the king as his entourage escorted him to his London-bound train. However, at the last moment she was persuaded by her first cousin, Prince Jean, Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg, to come to London, where he planned to host a party. Upon arrival in London, she stopped by Claridge&#x27;s to see her parents, and found herself being introduced unexpectedly to King Michael I. Abashed to the point of confusion, she clicked her heels instead of curtseying, and fled in embarrassment. Charmed, the king saw her again the night of the wedding at the Luxembourg embassy &quot;soirée&quot;, confided in her some of his concerns about the Communist takeover of Romania and fears for his mother&#x27;s safety, and nicknamed her &quot;Nan&quot;. They saw each other several times thereafter on outings in London, always chaperoned by her mother or brother.

A few days later, she accepted an invitation to accompany Michael and his mother when he piloted a Beechcraft aeroplane to take his aunt Princess Irene, Duchess of Aosta, back home to Lausanne. Sixteen days after meeting, Michael proposed to Anne while the couple were out on a drive in Lausanne. She initially declined, but later accepted after taking long walks and drives with him. Although Michael gave her an engagement ring a few days later, he felt obliged to refrain from a public announcement until he informed his government, despite the fact that the press besieged them in anticipation.

Michael I returned to Romania, where he was told by the prime minister that a wedding announcement was not &quot;opportune&quot;. Yet within days it was used as the government&#x27;s public explanation for Michael&#x27;s sudden &quot;abdication&quot;, when in fact the king was deposed by the Communists on 30 December. Princess Anne was unable to get further news of King Michael I until he left the country. They finally reunited in Davos on 23 January 1948.

===Wedding===

As a Bourbon, Anne was bound by the canon law of the Roman Catholic Church, which required that she receive a dispensation to marry a non-Catholic Christian (King Michael I was Orthodox). At the time, such a dispensation was normally only given if the non-Roman Catholic partner promised to allow the children of the marriage to be raised as Roman Catholics. Michael refused to make this promise since it would have violated Romania&#x27;s monarchical constitution, and would be likely to have a detrimental impact upon any possible restoration. The Holy See (which handled the matter directly since King Michael I was a member of a reigning dynasty) refused to grant the dispensation unless Michael made the required promise.

Helen, Queen Mother of Romania and her sister Princess Irene, Duchess of Aosta (an Orthodox married to a Catholic Prince) met with the fiancée&#x27;s parents in Paris, where the two families resolved to take their case to the Vatican in person. In early March, the couple&#x27;s mothers met with Pope Pius XII who, despite the entreaties of the Queen Mother and the fact that Anne&#x27;s mother, Princess Margrethe pounded her fist on the table in anger, refused permission for Anne to marry King Michael I.

It has been surmised that the Pope&#x27;s refusal was, in part, motivated by the fact that when Princess Giovanna of Savoy married Anne&#x27;s cousin, King Boris III of Bulgaria, in 1930, the couple had undertaken to raise their future children as Roman Catholics, but had baptized them in the Orthodox faith in deference to Bulgaria&#x27;s state religion. However, King Michael I declined to make a promise he could not keep politically, while Anne&#x27;s mother was herself the daughter of a mixed marriage between a Catholic (Princess Marie d&#x27;Orléans) and a Protestant (Prince Valdemar of Denmark), who had abided by their pre-ne temere compromise to raise their sons as Protestant and their daughter, Margrethe, as Catholic.

Although under a great deal of stress, the engaged couple resolved to proceed. Anne&#x27;s paternal uncle, Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma, issued a statement objecting to any marriage conducted against the will of the Pope and the bride&#x27;s family. It was he, not the Pontiff, who forbade Anne&#x27;s parents to attend the wedding. King Michael I&#x27;s spokesman declared on 9 June that the parents had been asked and had given their consent, and that the bride&#x27;s family would be represented at the nuptials by her maternal uncle, the Protestant Prince Erik of Denmark, who was to give the bride away.

The wedding ceremony was held on 10 June 1948 in Athens, Greece, in the throne room of the Royal Palace; the ceremony was performed by Archbishop Damaskinos, and King Paul I of Greece served as &quot;koumbaros&quot;. Guests at the wedding included: Michael&#x27;s mother The Queen Mother of Romania, aunts Queen Frederica, The Dowager Duchess of Aosta, Princess Katherine of Greece and Denmark; cousins Prince Amedeo, 5th Duke of Aosta, Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark, Crown Prince Constantine of Greece and Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark, the three youngest ones serving as bridesmaids and pageboy; Anne&#x27;s maternal uncle Prince Erik of Denmark; Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia, Princess Olga of Greece and Denmark, Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia, Prince George Wilhelm of Hanover and many other dignitaries. King Michael I&#x27;s father, Carol, and his sisters, Maria, Queen Mother of Yugoslavia, Princess Elisabeth of Romania (ex-Queen Consort of Greece) and Princess Ileana of Romania were notified, but not invited.

As no papal dispensation was given for the marriage, when it was celebrated according to the rites of the Eastern Orthodox Church, it was deemed invalid by the Roman Catholic Church, but perfectly legal by every other authority. The couple eventually took part in a religious ceremony again, on 9 November 1966, at the Roman Catholic Church of St Charles in Monaco, thus satisfying Roman Catholic canon law.

==Life in exile==
Michael would never see his father again, after Carol II&#x27;s 1940 abdication. Michael could see no point in meeting his father who had humiliated his mother so many times via his open affairs and did not attend his father&#x27;s funeral in 1953.

In January 1948, Michael began using one of his family&#x27;s ancestral titles, &quot;Prince of Hohenzollern&quot;, instead of using the title of &quot;King of Romania&quot;. After denouncing his abdication as forced and illegal in March 1948, Michael resumed use of the kingly title.

Michael and Princess Anne lived near Florence, Italy, until 1948, near Lausanne, Switzerland, until 1950, and then in Hertfordshire, England, until 1956. After that, the couple settled near Versoix, Switzerland, where they would live for the next 45 years. The Communist Romanian authorities stripped Michael of his Romanian citizenship in 1948.

During exile, Michael had a variety of occupations including farming, stockbroker, entrepreneur, and pilot. In 1957, he worked in Switzerland as a test pilot for a predecessor of aerospace manufacturer Learjet.

Together with his wife, he took part in the ship tour organized by Queen Frederica and her husband King Paul of Greece in 1954, which became known as the “Cruise of the Kings” and was attended by over 100 royals from all over Europe.

He had five daughters with his wife between 1949 and 1964.

==Return and rehabilitation==

On 25 December 1990—a year after the revolution which overthrew the Communist dictatorship of Nicolae Ceaușescu—Michael, accompanied by several members of the royal family, landed at Otopeni Airport and entered Romania for the first time in 43 years. Using a Danish diplomatic passport, Michael was able to obtain a 24-hour visa. He intended to reach Curtea de Argeș Cathedral, pray at the tombs of his royal ancestors and attend the Christmas religious service. However, on their way to Curtea de Argeș, the former King and his companions were stopped by a police blockade, taken to the airport and forced to leave the country.

In 1992, the Romanian government allowed Michael to return to Romania for Easter celebrations, where he drew large crowds. His speech from the balcony of a Hotel Continental 1st Fl. room drew over 100,000 people. His visit in Bucharest drew over a million people in the streets of the capital to see him. Michael refused the offer of the president of the National Liberal Party, Radu Câmpeanu, to run for elections as president of Romania. Michael&#x27;s popularity alarmed the government of President Ion Iliescu, and he was forbidden to re-visit Romania, being denied entry twice in 1994 and 1995.

In 1997, after Iliescu&#x27;s defeat by Emil Constantinescu, the Romanian government restored Michael&#x27;s citizenship and again allowed him to visit the country. He then lived partly in Switzerland at Aubonne and partly in Romania, either at Săvârșin Castle in Arad County or in an official residence in Bucharest—the Elisabeta Palace—voted by the Romanian Parliament by a law concerning arrangements for former heads of state. Besides Săvârșin Castle, the former private residences Peleș Castle and Pelișor Castle were also restituted. While Peleș and Pelișor are open to the public, Elisabeta Palace and Săvârșin are used as private residences. 
==Later years==
Michael neither encouraged nor opposed monarchist agitation in Romania and royalist parties have made little impact in post-communist Romanian politics. He took the view that the restoration of the monarchy in Romania can only result from a decision by the Romanian people. &quot;If the people want me to come back, of course, I will come back,&quot; he said in 1990. &quot;Romanians have had enough suffering imposed on them to have the right to be consulted on their future.&quot; King Michael&#x27;s belief was that there is still a role for, and value in, the monarchy today: &quot;We are trying to make people understand what the Romanian monarchy was, and what it can still do [for them].&quot;

According to a 2007 opinion poll conducted at the request of the Romanian royal family, only 14% of Romanians were in favour of the restoration of the monarchy. Another 2008 poll found that only 16% of Romanians are monarchists. Michael himself, however, was shown to be much more popular personally with the Romanian people: In a July 2013 survey, 45% of Romanians had a good or very good opinion of Michael, with 6.5% thinking the opposite. The royal family also enjoyed similar numbers, with 41% having a good or very good opinion of it, and just 6.5% having a poor or very poor one.

Michael undertook some quasi-diplomatic roles on behalf of post-communist Romania. In 1997 and 2002 he toured Western Europe, lobbying for Romania&#x27;s admission into NATO and the European Union, and was received by heads of state and government officials.

In December 2003, allegedly to the &quot;stupefaction of the public opinion in Romania&quot;, Michael awarded the &quot;Man of The Year 2003&quot; prize to Prime Minister Adrian Năstase, leader of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), on behalf of the tabloid &quot;VIP&quot;. The daily &quot;Evenimentul Zilei&quot; subsequently complained that &#x27;such an activity was unsuited to a king and that Michael was wasting away his prestige&#x27;, with the majority of the political analysts &#x27;considering his gesture as a fresh abdication&#x27;.

On 10 May 2007, King Michael received the Prague Society for International Cooperation and &#x27;s 6th Annual Hanno R. Ellenbogen Citizenship Award, previously awarded to Vladimir Ashkenazy, Madeleine Albright, Václav Havel, Lord Robertson, and Miloš Forman. On 8 April 2008, King Michael and Patriarch Daniel were elected as honorary members of the Romanian Academy.

Michael participated in the Victory Parade in Moscow in 2010 as the only living Supreme Commander-in-Chief of a European State in the Second World War. The name of Michael I is listed on the memorial in the Grand Kremlin Palace as one of only 20 recipients of the Order of Victory.

In old age, Michael enjoyed a strong revival in popularity. On 25 October 2011, on the occasion of his 90th birthday, he delivered a speech before the assembled chambers of the Romanian Parliament. An opinion poll in January 2012 placed him as the most trusted public figure in Romania, far ahead of the political leaders. Later, in October 2012, celebrating Michael&#x27;s 91st birthday, a square in Bucharest was renamed after him.

On 1 August 2016, he became a widower when Queen Anne died at the age of 92.

=== Health issues ===
On 2 March 2016, the Royal Council announced King Michael&#x27;s retirement from public life; with tasks assumed by Crown Princess Margareta, his daughter. After surgery, Michael was diagnosed with chronic leukemia and metastatic epidermoid carcinoma and faced a complex and lengthy treatment.

In June 2017, the Royal House stated in a press release that &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s health is fragile but stable. King Michael is quiet, has soulful appreciation and appreciates the care of his medical team. Along with the King, they are permanently employed by His Majesty&#x27;s House, detached in Switzerland, and two Orthodox nuns.&quot;

At the end of August 2017, the Royal House announced that King Michael was &quot;in a fragile but balanced state, and has a good mood,&quot; stating that Princess Elena had completed a visit to Switzerland for a few days to see her father, at the private residence. According to the Royal House, Michael remained &quot;daily under close supervision of physicians, medical staff of various specialties, and in the presence of devoted members of the staff of His Majesty&#x27;s House, stationed in Switzerland.&quot; Two Orthodox nuns, detached from the Romanian Orthodox Church, remained at the private residence.

== Death and state funeral ==
On 5 December 2017, Michael died at his residence in Switzerland at the age of 96, in the presence of his youngest daughter Princess Maria. His coffin, draped by his Royal Standard, was brought back to Romania on 13 December, arriving at the Otopeni Airport in Bucharest from Lausanne, via Payerne Air Base, escorted by his second daughter, Princess Elena with her husband Alexander Nixon, fourth daughter Sophie and also members of the Royal Household, were transported by the Romanian Air Force&#x27;s Alenia C-27J Spartan transport aircraft, which was flanked by four Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 jet fighters.

The coffin was first taken to Peleș Castle at Sinaia in the Carpathian Mountains. Then, it was brought to Bucharest, where it was laid and displayed at the Royal Palace for two days. King Michael I was buried on 16 December with full state honours in the Mausoleum of the Royal Family, on the grounds of the Curtea de Argeș Cathedral together with his wife Queen Anne who died in 2016. His body was transferred from Bucharest to Curtea de Argeș with the help of a funeral train, the Royal Train, and a repainted domestic-traffic carriage, being led by a diesel locomotive. His funeral is stated to have been one of the largest in Romania, with almost a million Romanians flocking to the capital to pay their respects and watch the funeral, with it being comparable to the one of Corneliu Coposu in 1995.

==Line of succession==
According to the succession provisions of the Romanian kingdom&#x27;s last democratically approved monarchical constitution of 1923, upon the death of King Michael without sons, the claim to the Crown devolves once again upon the Hohenzollern family. However, on 30 December 2007, on the 60th anniversary of his abdication, King Michael signed the &quot;Fundamental Rules of the Royal Family of Romania&quot;, by which he designated Princess Margareta as his heir. The document has no legal standing, as it regulates an institution that is no longer extant. 

On 10 May 2011, on a background of lawsuits in Germany brought against his family by Michael&#x27;s German relatives regarding the former name Hohenzollern-Veringen of his son-in-law, Radu, and of fears expressed by some that the German Hohenzollerns may claim succession to the headship of the Romanian royal house, Michael severed all of the dynastic and historical ties with the princely house of Hohenzollern, changed the name of his family to &quot;of Romania&quot;, and gave up all princely titles conferred upon him and his family by the German Hohenzollerns.

On 1 August 2015, Michael signed a document removing the title Prince of Romania and the qualification of Royal Highness from his grandson, Nicholas Medforth-Mills, who was also removed from the line of succession. The former king took the decision &quot;with an eye on Romania&#x27;s future after the reign and life of his eldest daughter, Margareta&quot;. The former king hoped that &quot;Nicholas will find in future years a suitable way to serve the ideals and use the qualities that God gave him&quot;. Nicholas&#x27;s mother, Princess Elena, received notification of the former king&#x27;s decision in a personal letter.

==Personality and personal interests==

Aged 16, when Michael was crown prince, he hit a bicyclist while driving a car, causing the cyclist&#x27;s death. The incident was censored in contemporary press, but appears in the official Censorship Records, and is confirmed by the memoirs of the former prime minister Constantin Argetoianu.

Michael was head of the Romanian Boy Scouts in the 1930s. He was passionate about cars, especially military jeeps. He was also interested in aircraft, having worked as a test pilot during exile.

Shortly after the Second World War, Michael became interested in Moral Rearmament, which was introduced to him by his first cousin Prince Richard of Hesse-Cassel, and as Swiss residents after 1956 he and Queen Anne paid numerous visits to the MRA conference centre of Caux, where he found solace for the loss of his country and his émigré status as well as new hope for future reconciliation.

<doc id="37257" wikidata="Q185252" url="?curid=37257" title="Radioactive waste">
<text>Radioactive waste is a type of hazardous waste that contains radioactive material. It is a result of many activities, including nuclear medicine, nuclear research, nuclear power generation, nuclear decommissioning, rare-earth mining, and nuclear weapons reprocessing. The storage and disposal of radioactive waste is regulated by government agencies in order to protect human health and the environment.

Radioactive waste is broadly classified into 3 categories: low-level waste (LLW), such as paper, rags, tools, clothing, which contain small amounts of mostly short-lived radioactivity; intermediate-level waste (ILW), which contains higher amounts of radioactivity and requires some shielding; and high-level waste (HLW), which is highly radioactive and hot due to decay heat, thus requiring cooling and shielding.

In nuclear reprocessing plants, about 96% of spent nuclear fuel is recycled back into uranium-based and mixed-oxide (MOX) fuels. The residual 4% is minor actinides and fission products, the latter of which are a mixture of stable and quickly decaying (most likely already having decayed in the spent fuel pool) elements, medium lived fission products such as strontium-90 and caesium-137 and finally seven long-lived fission products with half lives in the hundreds of thousands to millions of years. The minor actinides meanwhile are heavy elements other than uranium and plutonium which are created by neutron capture. Their half lives range from years to millions of years and as alpha emitters they are particularly radiotoxic. While there are proposed – and to a much lesser extent current – uses of all those elements, commercial scale reprocessing using the PUREX-process disposes of them as waste together with the fission products. The waste is subsequently converted into a glass-like ceramic for storage in a deep geological repository.

The time radioactive waste must be stored depends on the type of waste and radioactive isotopes it contains. Short-term approaches to radioactive waste storage have been segregation and storage on the surface or near-surface of the earth. Burial in a deep geological repository is a favored solution for long-term storage of high-level waste, while re-use and transmutation are favored solutions for reducing the HLW inventory. Boundaries to recycling of spent nuclear fuel are regulatory and economic as well as the issue of radioactive contamination if chemical separation processes cannot achieve a very high purity. Furthermore, elements may be present in both useful and troublesome isotopes, which would require costly and energy intensive isotope separation for their use – a currently uneconomic prospect.

A summary of the amounts of radioactive waste and management approaches for most developed countries are presented and reviewed periodically as part of a joint convention of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

== Nature and significance ==
A quantity of radioactive waste typically consists of a number of radionuclides, which are unstable isotopes of elements that undergo decay and thereby emit ionizing radiation, which is harmful to humans and the environment. Different isotopes emit different types and levels of radiation, which last for different periods of time.

=== Physics ===


The radioactivity of all radioactive waste weakens with time. All radionuclides contained in the waste have a half-life—the time it takes for half of the atoms to decay into another nuclide. Eventually, all radioactive waste decays into non-radioactive elements (i.e., stable nuclides). Since radioactive decay follows the half-life rule, the rate of decay is inversely proportional to the duration of decay. In other words, the radiation from a long-lived isotope like iodine-129 will be much less intense than that of a short-lived isotope like iodine-131. The two tables show some of the major radioisotopes, their half-lives, and their radiation yield as a proportion of the yield of fission of uranium-235.

The energy and the type of the ionizing radiation emitted by a radioactive substance are also important factors in determining its threat to humans. The chemical properties of the radioactive element will determine how mobile the substance is and how likely it is to spread into the environment and contaminate humans. This is further complicated by the fact that many radioisotopes do not decay immediately to a stable state but rather to radioactive decay products within a decay chain before ultimately reaching a stable state.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Exposure to radioactive waste may cause health impacts due to ionizing radiation exposure. In humans, a dose of 1 sievert carries a 5.5% risk of developing cancer, and regulatory agencies assume the risk is linearly proportional to dose even for low doses. Ionizing radiation can cause deletions in chromosomes. If a developing organism such as a fetus is irradiated, it is possible a birth defect may be induced, but it is unlikely this defect will be in a gamete or a gamete-forming cell. The incidence of radiation-induced mutations in humans is small, as in most mammals, because of natural cellular-repair mechanisms, many just now coming to light. These mechanisms range from DNA, mRNA and protein repair, to internal lysosomic digestion of defective proteins, and even induced cell suicide—apoptosis

Depending on the decay mode and the pharmacokinetics of an element (how the body processes it and how quickly), the threat due to exposure to a given activity of a radioisotope will differ. For instance, iodine-131 is a short-lived beta and gamma emitter, but because it concentrates in the thyroid gland, it is more able to cause injury than caesium-137 which, being water soluble, is rapidly excreted through urine. In a similar way, the alpha emitting actinides and radium are considered very harmful as they tend to have long biological half-lives and their radiation has a high relative biological effectiveness, making it far more damaging to tissues per amount of energy deposited. Because of such differences, the rules determining biological injury differ widely according to the radioisotope, time of exposure, and sometimes also the nature of the chemical compound which contains the radioisotope.

== Sources ==

Radioactive waste comes from a number of sources. In countries with nuclear power plants, nuclear armament, or nuclear fuel treatment plants, the majority of waste originates from the nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear weapons reprocessing. Other sources include medical and industrial wastes, as well as naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) that can be concentrated as a result of the processing or consumption of coal, oil, and gas, and some minerals, as discussed below.

=== Nuclear fuel cycle ===

==== Front end ====
Waste from the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle is usually alpha-emitting waste from the extraction of uranium. It often contains radium and its decay products.

Uranium dioxide (UO2) concentrate from mining is a thousand or so times as radioactive as the granite used in buildings. It is refined from yellowcake (U3O8), then converted to uranium hexafluoride gas (UF6). As a gas, it undergoes enrichment to increase the U-235 content from 0.7% to about 4.4% (LEU). It is then turned into a hard ceramic oxide (UO2) for assembly as reactor fuel elements.

The main by-product of enrichment is depleted uranium (DU), principally the U-238 isotope, with a U-235 content of ~0.3%. It is stored, either as UF6 or as U3O8. Some is used in applications where its extremely high density makes it valuable such as anti-tank shells, and on at least one occasion even a sailboat keel. It is also used with plutonium for making mixed oxide fuel (MOX) and to dilute, or downblend, highly enriched uranium from weapons stockpiles which is now being redirected to become reactor fuel.

==== Back end ====

The back-end of the nuclear fuel cycle, mostly spent fuel rods, contains fission products that emit beta and gamma radiation, and actinides that emit alpha particles, such as uranium-234 (half-life 245 thousand years), neptunium-237 (2.144 million years), plutonium-238 (87.7 years) and americium-241 (432 years), and even sometimes some neutron emitters such as californium (half-life of 898 years for californium-251). These isotopes are formed in nuclear reactors.

It is important to distinguish the processing of uranium to make fuel from the reprocessing of used fuel. Used fuel contains the highly radioactive products of fission (see high-level waste below). Many of these are neutron absorbers, called neutron poisons in this context. These eventually build up to a level where they absorb so many neutrons that the chain reaction stops, even with the control rods completely removed from a reactor. At that point, the fuel has to be replaced in the reactor with fresh fuel, even though there is still a substantial quantity of uranium-235 and plutonium present. In the United States, this used fuel is usually &quot;stored&quot;, while in other countries such as Russia, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, and India, the fuel is reprocessed to remove the fission products, and the fuel can then be re-used. The fission products removed from the fuel are a concentrated form of high-level waste as are the chemicals used in the process. While most countries reprocess the fuel carrying out single plutonium cycles, India is planning multiple plutonium recycling schemes and Russia pursues closed cycle.

==== Fuel composition and long term radioactivity ====


The use of different fuels in nuclear reactors results in different spent nuclear fuel (SNF) composition, with varying activity curves. The most abundant material being U-238 with other uranium isotopes, other actinides, fission products and activation products.

Long-lived radioactive waste from the back end of the fuel cycle is especially relevant when designing a complete waste management plan for SNF. When looking at long-term radioactive decay, the actinides in the SNF have a significant influence due to their characteristically long half-lives. Depending on what a nuclear reactor is fueled with, the actinide composition in the SNF will be different.

An example of this effect is the use of nuclear fuels with thorium. Th-232 is a fertile material that can undergo a neutron capture reaction and two beta minus decays, resulting in the production of fissile U-233. The SNF of a cycle with thorium will contain U-233. Its radioactive decay will strongly influence the long-term activity curve of the SNF for around a million years. A comparison of the activity associated to U-233 for three different SNF types can be seen in the figure on the top right. The burnt fuels are thorium with reactor-grade plutonium (RGPu), thorium with weapons-grade plutonium (WGPu), and Mixed oxide fuel (MOX, no thorium). For RGPu and WGPu, the initial amount of U-233 and its decay for around a million years can be seen. This has an effect on the total activity curve of the three fuel types. The initial absence of U-233 and its daughter products in the MOX fuel results in a lower activity in region 3 of the figure at the bottom right, whereas for RGPu and WGPu the curve is maintained higher due to the presence of U-233 that has not fully decayed. Nuclear reprocessing can remove the actinides from the spent fuel so they can be used or destroyed (see ).

==== Proliferation concerns ====
Since uranium and plutonium are nuclear weapons materials, there are proliferation concerns. Ordinarily (in spent nuclear fuel), plutonium is reactor-grade plutonium. In addition to plutonium-239, which is highly suitable for building nuclear weapons, it contains large amounts of undesirable contaminants: plutonium-240, plutonium-241, and plutonium-238. These isotopes are extremely difficult to separate, and more cost-effective ways of obtaining fissile material exist (e.g., uranium enrichment or dedicated plutonium production reactors).

High-level waste is full of highly radioactive fission products, most of which are relatively short-lived. This is a concern since if the waste is stored, perhaps in deep geological storage, over many years the fission products decay, decreasing the radioactivity of the waste and making the plutonium easier to access. The undesirable contaminant Pu-240 decays faster than the Pu-239, and thus the quality of the bomb material increases with time (although its quantity decreases during that time as well). Thus, some have argued, as time passes, these deep storage areas have the potential to become &quot;plutonium mines&quot;, from which material for nuclear weapons can be acquired with relatively little difficulty. Critics of the latter idea have pointed out the difficulty of recovering useful material from sealed deep storage areas makes other methods preferable. Specifically, high radioactivity and heat (80 °C in surrounding rock) greatly increase the difficulty of mining a storage area, and the enrichment methods required have high capital costs.

Pu-239 decays to U-235 which is suitable for weapons and which has a very long half-life (roughly 109 years). Thus plutonium may decay and leave uranium-235. However, modern reactors are only moderately enriched with U-235 relative to U-238, so the U-238 continues to serve as a denaturation agent for any U-235 produced by plutonium decay.

One solution to this problem is to recycle the plutonium and use it as a fuel e.g. in fast reactors. In pyrometallurgical fast reactors, the separated plutonium and uranium are contaminated by actinides and cannot be used for nuclear weapons.

=== Nuclear weapons decommissioning ===
Waste from nuclear weapons decommissioning is unlikely to contain much beta or gamma activity other than tritium and americium. It is more likely to contain alpha-emitting actinides such as Pu-239 which is a fissile material used in nuclear bombs, plus some material with much higher specific activities, such as Pu-238 or Po.

In the past the neutron trigger for an atomic bomb tended to be beryllium and a high activity alpha emitter such as polonium; an alternative to polonium is Pu-238. For reasons of national security, details of the design of modern nuclear bombs are normally not released to the open literature.

Some designs might contain a radioisotope thermoelectric generator using Pu-238 to provide a long-lasting source of electrical power for the electronics in the device.

It is likely that the fissile material of an old nuclear bomb, which is due for refitting, will contain decay products of the plutonium isotopes used in it. These are likely to include U-236 from Pu-240 impurities plus some U-235 from decay of the Pu-239; due to the relatively long half-life of these Pu isotopes, these wastes from radioactive decay of bomb core material would be very small, and in any case, far less dangerous (even in terms of simple radioactivity) than the Pu-239 itself.

The beta decay of Pu-241 forms Am-241; the in-growth of americium is likely to be a greater problem than the decay of Pu-239 and Pu-240 as the americium is a gamma emitter (increasing external-exposure to workers) and is an alpha emitter which can cause the generation of heat. The plutonium could be separated from the americium by several different processes; these would include pyrochemical processes and aqueous/organic solvent extraction. A truncated PUREX type extraction process would be one possible method of making the separation. Naturally occurring uranium is not fissile because it contains 99.3% of U-238 and only 0.7% of U-235.

=== Legacy waste ===
Due to historic activities typically related to the radium industry, uranium mining, and military programs, numerous sites contain or are contaminated with radioactivity. In the United States alone, the Department of Energy (DOE) states there are &quot;millions of gallons of radioactive waste&quot; as well as &quot;thousands of tons of spent nuclear fuel and material&quot; and also &quot;huge quantities of contaminated soil and water.&quot; Despite copious quantities of waste, in 2007, the DOE stated a goal of cleaning all presently contaminated sites successfully by 2025. The Fernald, Ohio site for example had &quot;31 million pounds of uranium product&quot;, &quot;2.5 billion pounds of waste&quot;, &quot;2.75 million cubic yards of contaminated soil and debris&quot;, and a &quot;223 acre portion of the underlying Great Miami Aquifer had uranium levels above drinking standards.&quot; The United States has at least 108 sites designated as areas that are contaminated and unusable, sometimes many thousands of acres. The DOE wishes to clean or mitigate many or all by 2025, using the recently developed method of geomelting, however the task can be difficult and it acknowledges that some may never be completely remediated. In just one of these 108 larger designations, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), there were for example at least &quot;167 known contaminant release sites&quot; in one of the three subdivisions of the site. Some of the U.S. sites were smaller in nature, however, cleanup issues were simpler to address, and the DOE has successfully completed cleanup, or at least closure, of several sites.

=== Medicine ===
Radioactive medical waste tends to contain beta particle and gamma ray emitters. It can be divided into two main classes. In diagnostic nuclear medicine a number of short-lived gamma emitters such as technetium-99m are used. Many of these can be disposed of by leaving it to decay for a short time before disposal as normal waste. Other isotopes used in medicine, with half-lives in parentheses, include:
* Y-90, used for treating lymphoma (2.7 days)
* I-131, used for thyroid function tests and for treating thyroid cancer (8.0 days)
* Sr-89, used for treating bone cancer, intravenous injection (52 days)
* Ir-192, used for brachytherapy (74 days)
* Co-60, used for brachytherapy and external radiotherapy (5.3 years)
* Cs-137, used for brachytherapy and external radiotherapy (30 years)
* Tc-99, product of the decay of Technetium-99m (221,000 years)

=== Industry ===
Industrial source waste can contain alpha, beta, neutron or gamma emitters. Gamma emitters are used in radiography while neutron emitting sources are used in a range of applications, such as oil well logging.

=== Naturally occurring radioactive material ===
Substances containing natural radioactivity are known as NORM (naturally occurring radioactive material). After human processing that exposes or concentrates this natural radioactivity (such as mining bringing coal to the surface or burning it to produce concentrated ash), it becomes technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material (TENORM). Much of this waste is alpha particle-emitting matter from the decay chains of uranium and thorium. The main source of radiation in the human body is potassium-40 (40K), typically 17 milligrams in the body at a time and 0.4 milligrams/day intake. Most rocks, especially granite, have a low level of radioactivity due to the potassium-40, thorium and uranium contained.

Usually ranging from 1 millisievert (mSv) to 13 mSv annually depending on location, average radiation exposure from natural radioisotopes is 2.0 mSv per person a year worldwide. This makes up the majority of typical total dosage (with mean annual exposure from other sources amounting to 0.6 mSv from medical tests averaged over the whole populace, 0.4 mSv from cosmic rays, 0.005 mSv from the legacy of past atmospheric nuclear testing, 0.005 mSv occupational exposure, 0.002 mSv from the Chernobyl disaster, and 0.0002 mSv from the nuclear fuel cycle).

TENORM is not regulated as restrictively as nuclear reactor waste, though there are no significant differences in the radiological risks of these materials.

==== Coal ====
Coal contains a small amount of radioactive uranium, barium, thorium, and potassium, but, in the case of pure coal, this is significantly less than the average concentration of those elements in the Earth&#x27;s crust. The surrounding strata, if shale or mudstone, often contain slightly more than average and this may also be reflected in the ash content of &#x27;dirty&#x27; coals. The more active ash minerals become concentrated in the fly ash precisely because they do not burn well. The radioactivity of fly ash is about the same as black shale and is less than phosphate rocks, but is more of a concern because a small amount of the fly ash ends up in the atmosphere where it can be inhaled. According to U.S. National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) reports, population exposure from 1000-MWe power plants amounts to 490 person-rem/year for coal power plants, 100 times as great as nuclear power plants (4.8 person-rem/year). The exposure from the complete nuclear fuel cycle from mining to waste disposal is 136 person-rem/year; the corresponding value for coal use from mining to waste disposal is &quot;probably unknown&quot;.

==== Oil and gas ====
Residues from the oil and gas industry often contain radium and its decay products. The sulfate scale from an oil well can be radium rich, while the water, oil, and gas from a well often contain radon. The radon decays to form solid radioisotopes which form coatings on the inside of pipework. In an oil processing plant, the area of the plant where propane is processed is often one of the more contaminated areas of the plant as radon has a similar boiling point to propane.

Radioactive elements are an industrial problem in some oil wells where workers operating in direct contact with the crude oil and brine can be exposed to doses having negative health effects. Due to the relatively high concentration of these elements in the brine, its disposal is also a technological challenge. Since the 1980s, in the United States, the brine is however exempt from the dangerous waste regulations and can be disposed of regardless of radioactive or toxic substances content.

==== Rare-earth mining ====
Due to natural occurrence of radioactive elements such as thorium and radium in rare-earth ore, mining operations also result in production of waste and mineral deposits that are slightly radioactive. 
== Classification ==
Classification of radioactive waste varies by country. The IAEA, which publishes the Radioactive Waste Safety Standards (RADWASS), also plays a significant role. The proportion of various types of waste generated in the UK:

* 94% – low-level waste (LLW)
* ~6% – intermediate-level waste (ILW)
* &lt;1% – high-level waste (HLW)

=== Mill tailings ===

Uranium tailings are waste by-product materials left over from the rough processing of uranium-bearing ore. They are not significantly radioactive. Mill tailings are sometimes referred to as 11(e)2 wastes, from the section of the US Atomic Energy Act of 1946 that defines them. Uranium mill tailings typically also contain chemically hazardous heavy metal such as lead and arsenic. Vast mounds of uranium mill tailings are left at many old mining sites, especially in Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah.

Although mill tailings are not very radioactive, they have long half-lives. Mill tailings often contain radium, thorium and trace amounts of uranium.

=== Low-level waste ===

Low-level waste (LLW) is generated from hospitals and industry, as well as the nuclear fuel cycle. Low-level wastes include paper, rags, tools, clothing, filters, and other materials which contain small amounts of mostly short-lived radioactivity. Materials that originate from any region of an Active Area are commonly designated as LLW as a precautionary measure even if there is only a remote possibility of being contaminated with radioactive materials. Such LLW typically exhibits no higher radioactivity than one would expect from the same material disposed of in a non-active area, such as a normal office block. Example LLW includes wiping rags, mops, medical tubes, laboratory animal carcasses, and more. LLW makes up 94% of all radioactive waste volume in the UK. Most of it is disposed of in Cumbria, first in landfill style trenches, and now using grouted metal containers that are stacked in concrete vaults. A new site in the north of Scotland is the Dounreay site which is prepared to withstand a 4m tsunami.

Some high-activity LLW requires shielding during handling and transport but most LLW is suitable for shallow land burial. To reduce its volume, it is often compacted or incinerated before disposal. Low-level waste is divided into four classes: &quot;class A&quot;, &quot;class B&quot;, &quot;class C&quot;, and &quot;Greater Than Class C&quot; (&quot;GTCC&quot;).

=== Intermediate-level waste ===
Intermediate-level waste (ILW) contains higher amounts of radioactivity compared to low-level waste. It generally requires shielding, but not cooling. Intermediate-level wastes includes resins, chemical sludge and metal nuclear fuel cladding, as well as contaminated materials from reactor decommissioning. It may be solidified in concrete or bitumen or mixed with silica sand and vitrified for disposal. As a general rule, short-lived waste (mainly non-fuel materials from reactors) is buried in shallow repositories, while long-lived waste (from fuel and fuel reprocessing) is deposited in geological repository. Regulations in the United States do not define this category of waste; the term is used in Europe and elsewhere. ILW makes up 6% of all radioactive waste volume in the UK.

=== High-level waste ===

High-level waste (HLW) is produced by nuclear reactors and the reprocessing of nuclear fuel. The exact definition of HLW differs internationally. After a nuclear fuel rod serves one fuel cycle and is removed from the core, it is considered HLW. Spent fuel rods contain mostly uranium with fission products and transuranic elements generated in the reactor core. Spent fuel is highly radioactive and often hot. HLW accounts for over 95% of the total radioactivity produced in the process of nuclear electricity generation but it contributes to less than 1% of volume of all radioactive waste produced in the UK. Overall, the 60-year-long nuclear program in the UK up until 2019 produced 2150 m3 of HLW.

The radioactive waste from spent fuel rods consists primarily of cesium-137 and strontium-90, but it may also include plutonium, which can be considered transuranic waste. The half-lives of these radioactive elements can differ quite extremely. Some elements, such as cesium-137 and strontium-90 have half-lives of approximately 30 years. Meanwhile, plutonium has a half-life that can stretch to as long as 24,000 years.

The amount of HLW worldwide is increasing by about 12,000 tonnes per year. A 1000-megawatt nuclear power plant produces about 27 tonnes of spent nuclear fuel (unreprocessed) every year. For comparison, the amount of ash produced by coal power plants in the United States is estimated at 130,000,000 t per year and fly ash is estimated to release 100 times more radiation than an equivalent nuclear power plant.
In 2010, it was estimated that about 250,000 t of nuclear HLW were stored globally. This does not include amounts that have escaped into the environment from accidents or tests. Japan is estimated to hold 17,000 t of HLW in storage in 2015. As of 2019, the United States has over 90,000 t of HLW. HLW have been shipped to other countries to be stored or reprocessed and, in some cases, shipped back as active fuel.

The ongoing controversy over high-level radioactive waste disposal is a major constraint on nuclear power global expansion. Most scientists agree that the main proposed long-term solution is deep geological burial, either in a mine or a deep borehole. As of 2019, no dedicated civilian high-level nuclear waste site is operational as small amounts of HLW did not justify the investment in the past. Finland is in the advanced stage of the construction of the Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository, which is planned to open in 2025 at 400–450 m depth. France is in the planning phase for a 500 m deep Cigeo facility in Bure. Sweden is planning a site in Forsmark. Canada plans a 680 m deep facility near Lake Huron in Ontario. The Republic of Korea plans to open a site around 2028. The site in Sweden enjoys 80% support from local residents as of 2020.

The Morris Operation in Grundy County, Illinois, is currently the only &quot;de facto&quot; high-level radioactive waste storage site in the United States.

=== Transuranic waste ===
Transuranic waste (TRUW) as defined by U.S. regulations is, without regard to form or origin, waste that is contaminated with alpha-emitting transuranic radionuclides with half-lives greater than 20 years and concentrations greater than 100 nCi/g (3.7 MBq/kg), excluding high-level waste. Elements that have an atomic number greater than uranium are called transuranic (&quot;beyond uranium&quot;). Because of their long half-lives, TRUW is disposed of more cautiously than either low- or intermediate-level waste. In the United States, it arises mainly from nuclear weapons production, and consists of clothing, tools, rags, residues, debris, and other items contaminated with small amounts of radioactive elements (mainly plutonium).

Under U.S. law, transuranic waste is further categorized into &quot;contact-handled&quot; (CH) and &quot;remote-handled&quot; (RH) on the basis of the radiation dose rate measured at the surface of the waste container. CH TRUW has a surface dose rate not greater than 200 mrem per hour (2 mSv/h), whereas RH TRUW has a surface dose rate of 200 mrem/h (2 mSv/h) or greater. CH TRUW does not have the very high radioactivity of high-level waste, nor its high heat generation, but RH TRUW can be highly radioactive, with surface dose rates up to 1,000,000 mrem/h (10,000 mSv/h). The United States currently disposes of TRUW generated from military facilities at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in a deep salt formation in New Mexico.

== Prevention ==
A future way to reduce waste accumulation is to phase out current reactors in favor of Generation IV reactors, which output less waste per power generated. Fast reactors such as BN-800 in Russia are also able to consume MOX fuel that is manufactured from recycled spent fuel from traditional reactors.

The UK&#x27;s Nuclear Decommissioning Authority published a position paper in 2014 on the progress on approaches to the management of separated plutonium, which summarises the conclusions of the work that the NDA shared with the UK government.

== Management ==


Of particular concern in nuclear waste management are two long-lived fission products, Tc-99 (half-life 220,000 years) and I-129 (half-life 15.7 million years), which dominate spent fuel radioactivity after a few thousand years. The most troublesome transuranic elements in spent fuel are Np-237 (half-life two million years) and Pu-239 (half-life 24,000 years). Nuclear waste requires sophisticated treatment and management to successfully isolate it from interacting with the biosphere. This usually necessitates treatment, followed by a long-term management strategy involving storage, disposal or transformation of the waste into a non-toxic form. Governments around the world are considering a range of waste management and disposal options, though there has been limited progress toward long-term waste management solutions.
Several methods of disposal of radioactive waste have been investigated:
* Deep geological repository
* Dry cask storage
* Deep borehole disposal – not implemented.
* Rock melting – not implemented.
* Ocean disposal – used by the USSR, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, the United States, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Japan, Sweden, Russia, Germany, Italy and South Korea (1954–1993). This is no longer permitted by international agreements.
* Disposal in ice sheets – rejected in Antarctic Treaty.
* Deep well injection – used by USSR and USA.
* Nuclear transmutation, using neutron capture to convert the unstable atoms to those with shorter half-lives.
* Nuclear reprocessing such as the PUREX process allows for reuse of some radioactive materials.
* Disposal in outer space – not implemented as too expensive.

In the United States, waste management policy broke down with the ending of work on the incomplete Yucca Mountain Repository. At present there are 70 nuclear power plant sites where spent fuel is stored. A Blue Ribbon Commission was appointed by U.S. President Obama to look into future options for this and future waste. A deep geological repository seems to be favored.

Ducrete, Saltcrete, and Synroc are methods for immobilizing nuclear waste.

=== Initial treatment ===

==== Vitrification ====
Long-term storage of radioactive waste requires the stabilization of the waste into a form that will neither react nor degrade for extended periods. It is theorized that one way to do this might be through vitrification. Currently at Sellafield, the high-level waste (PUREX first cycle raffinate) is mixed with sugar and then calcined. Calcination involves passing the waste through a heated, rotating tube. The purposes of calcination are to evaporate the water from the waste and de-nitrate the fission products to assist the stability of the glass produced.

The &#x27;calcine&#x27; generated is fed continuously into an induction heated furnace with fragmented glass. The resulting glass is a new substance in which the waste products are bonded into the glass matrix when it solidifies. As a melt, this product is poured into stainless steel cylindrical containers (&quot;cylinders&quot;) in a batch process. When cooled, the fluid solidifies (&quot;vitrifies&quot;) into the glass. After being formed, the glass is highly resistant to water.

After filling a cylinder, a seal is welded onto the cylinder head. The cylinder is then washed. After being inspected for external contamination, the steel cylinder is stored, usually in an underground repository. In this form, the waste products are expected to be immobilized for thousands of years.

The glass inside a cylinder is usually a black glossy substance. All this work (in the United Kingdom) is done using hot cell systems. Sugar is added to control the ruthenium chemistry and to stop the formation of the volatile RuO4 containing radioactive ruthenium isotopes. In the West, the glass is normally a borosilicate glass (similar to Pyrex), while in the former Soviet Union it is normal to use a phosphate glass. The amount of fission products in the glass must be limited because some (palladium, the other Pt group metals, and tellurium) tend to form metallic phases which separate from the glass. Bulk vitrification uses electrodes to melt soil and wastes, which are then buried underground. In Germany, a vitrification plant is treating the waste from a small demonstration reprocessing plant which has since been closed.

==== Phosphate ceramics ====
Vitrification is not the only way to stabilize the waste into a form that will not react or degrade for extended periods. Immobilization via direct incorporation into a phosphate-based crystalline ceramic host is also used. The diverse chemistry of phosphate ceramics under various conditions demonstrates a versatile material that can withstand chemical, thermal, and radioactive degradation over time. The properties of phosphates, particularly ceramic phosphates, of stability over a wide pH range, low porosity, and minimization of secondary waste introduces possibilities for new waste immobilization techniques.

==== Ion exchange ====
It is common for medium active wastes in the nuclear industry to be treated with ion exchange or other means to concentrate the radioactivity into a small volume. The much less radioactive bulk (after treatment) is often then discharged. For instance, it is possible to use a ferric hydroxide floc to remove radioactive metals from aqueous mixtures. After the radioisotopes are absorbed onto the ferric hydroxide, the resulting sludge can be placed in a metal drum before being mixed with cement to form solid waste. In order to get better long-term performance (mechanical stability) from such forms, they may be made from a mixture of fly ash, or blast furnace slag, and portland cement, instead of normal concrete (made with portland cement, gravel and sand).

==== Synroc ====
The Australian Synroc (synthetic rock) is a more sophisticated way to immobilize such waste, and this process may eventually come into commercial use for civil wastes (it is currently being developed for U.S. military wastes). Synroc was invented by Ted Ringwood, a geochemist at the Australian National University. The Synroc contains pyrochlore and cryptomelane type minerals. The original form of Synroc (Synroc C) was designed for the liquid high-level waste (PUREX raffinate) from a light-water reactor. The main minerals in this Synroc are hollandite (BaAl2Ti6O16), zirconolite (CaZrTi2O7) and perovskite (CaTiO3). The zirconolite and perovskite are hosts for the actinides. The strontium and barium will be fixed in the perovskite. The caesium will be fixed in the hollandite. A Synroc waste treatment facility began construction in 2018 at ANSTO.

=== Long-term management ===

The time frame in question when dealing with radioactive waste ranges from 10,000 to 1,000,000 years, according to studies based on the effect of estimated radiation doses. Researchers suggest that forecasts of health detriment for such periods should be examined critically. Practical studies only consider up to 100 years as far as effective planning and cost evaluations are concerned. Long term behavior of radioactive wastes remains a subject for ongoing research projects in geoforecasting.

==== Remediation ====
Algae has shown selectivity for strontium in studies, where most plants used in bioremediation have not shown selectivity between calcium and strontium, often becoming saturated with calcium, which is present in greater quantities in nuclear waste. Strontium-90 with a half life around 30 years, is classified as high-level waste.

Researchers have looked at the bioaccumulation of strontium by &quot;Scenedesmus spinosus&quot; (algae) in simulated wastewater. The study claims a highly selective biosorption capacity for strontium of S. spinosus, suggesting that it may be appropriate for use of nuclear wastewater. A study of the pond alga &quot;Closterium moniliferum&quot; using non-radioactive strontium found that varying the ratio of barium to strontium in water improved strontium selectivity.

==== Above-ground disposal ====
Dry cask storage typically involves taking waste from a spent fuel pool and sealing it (along with an inert gas) in a steel cylinder, which is placed in a concrete cylinder which acts as a radiation shield. It is a relatively inexpensive method which can be done at a central facility or adjacent to the source reactor. The waste can be easily retrieved for reprocessing.

==== Geologic disposal ====

The process of selecting appropriate deep final repositories for high-level waste and spent fuel is now underway in several countries with the first expected to be commissioned sometime after 2010. The basic concept is to locate a large, stable geologic formation and use mining technology to excavate a tunnel, or use large-bore tunnel boring machines (similar to those used to drill the Channel Tunnel from England to France) to drill a shaft below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of high-level radioactive waste. The goal is to permanently isolate nuclear waste from the human environment. Many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate stewardship cessation of this disposal system, suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent.

Because some radioactive species have half-lives longer than one million years, even very low container leakage and radionuclide migration rates must be taken into account. Moreover, it may require more than one half-life until some nuclear materials lose enough radioactivity to cease being lethal to living things. A 1983 review of the Swedish radioactive waste disposal program by the National Academy of Sciences found that country&#x27;s estimate of several hundred thousand years—perhaps up to one million years—being necessary for waste isolation &quot;fully justified.&quot;

The proposed land-based subductive waste disposal method disposes of nuclear waste in a subduction zone accessed from land and therefore is not prohibited by international agreement. This method has been described as the most viable means of disposing of radioactive waste, and as the state-of-the-art as of 2001 in nuclear waste disposal technology.

Another approach termed Remix &amp; Return would blend high-level waste with uranium mine and mill tailings down to the level of the original radioactivity of the uranium ore, then replace it in inactive uranium mines. This approach has the merits of providing jobs for miners who would double as disposal staff, and of facilitating a cradle-to-grave cycle for radioactive materials, but would be inappropriate for spent reactor fuel in the absence of reprocessing, due to the presence of highly toxic radioactive elements such as plutonium within it.

Deep borehole disposal is the concept of disposing of high-level radioactive waste from nuclear reactors in extremely deep boreholes. Deep borehole disposal seeks to place the waste as much as beneath the surface of the Earth and relies primarily on the immense natural geological barrier to confine the waste safely and permanently so that it should never pose a threat to the environment. The Earth&#x27;s crust contains 120 trillion tons of thorium and 40 trillion tons of uranium (primarily at relatively trace concentrations of parts per million each adding up over the crust&#x27;s 3 × 1019 ton mass), among other natural radioisotopes. Since the fraction of nuclides decaying per unit of time is inversely proportional to an isotope&#x27;s half-life, the relative radioactivity of the lesser amount of human-produced radioisotopes (thousands of tons instead of trillions of tons) would diminish once the isotopes with far shorter half-lives than the bulk of natural radioisotopes decayed.

In January 2013, Cumbria county council rejected UK central government proposals to start work on an underground storage dump for nuclear waste near to the Lake District National Park. &quot;For any host community, there will be a substantial community benefits package and worth hundreds of millions of pounds&quot; said Ed Davey, Energy Secretary, but nonetheless, the local elected body voted 7–3 against research continuing, after hearing evidence from independent geologists that &quot;the fractured strata of the county was impossible to entrust with such dangerous material and a hazard lasting millennia.&quot;

Horizontal drillhole disposal describes proposals to drill over one km vertically, and two km horizontally in the earth&#x27;s crust, for the purpose of disposing of high-level waste forms such as spent nuclear fuel, Caesium-137, or Strontium-90. After the emplacement and the retrievability period, drillholes would be backfilled and sealed. A series of tests of the technology were carried out in November 2018 and then again publicly in January 2019 by a U.S. based private company. The test demonstrated the emplacement of a test-canister in a horizontal drillhole and retrieval of the same canister. There was no actual high-level waste used in the test.

The European Commission Joint Research Centre report of 2021 (see above) concluded:

==== Ocean floor disposal ====

From 1946 through 1993, thirteen countries used ocean disposal or ocean dumping as a method to dispose of nuclear/radioactive waste with an approximation of 200,000 tons sourcing mainly from the medical, research and nuclear industry.

Ocean floor disposal of radioactive waste has been suggested by the finding that deep waters in the North Atlantic Ocean do not present an exchange with shallow waters for about 140 years based on oxygen content data recorded over a period of 25 years. They include burial beneath a stable abyssal plain, burial in a subduction zone that would slowly carry the waste downward into the Earth&#x27;s mantle, and burial beneath a remote natural or human-made island. While these approaches all have merit and would facilitate an international solution to the problem of disposal of radioactive waste, they would require an amendment of the Law of the Sea.

Nuclear submarines have been lost and these vessels reactors must also be counted in the amount of radioactive waste deposited at sea.

Article 1 (Definitions), 7., of the 1996 Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, (the London Dumping Convention) states:

:&quot;&quot;Sea&quot; means all marine waters other than the internal waters of States, as well as the seabed and the subsoil thereof; it does not include sub-seabed repositories accessed only from land.&quot;

==== Transmutation ====

There have been proposals for reactors that consume nuclear waste and transmute it to other, less-harmful or shorter-lived, nuclear waste. In particular, the integral fast reactor was a proposed nuclear reactor with a nuclear fuel cycle that produced no transuranic waste and, in fact, could consume transuranic waste. It proceeded as far as large-scale tests but was eventually canceled by the U.S. Government. Another approach, considered safer but requiring more development, is to dedicate subcritical reactors to the transmutation of the left-over transuranic elements.

An isotope that is found in nuclear waste and that represents a concern in terms of proliferation is Pu-239. The large stock of plutonium is a result of its production inside uranium-fueled reactors and of the reprocessing of weapons-grade plutonium during the weapons program. An option for getting rid of this plutonium is to use it as a fuel in a traditional light-water reactors (LWR). Several fuel types with differing plutonium destruction efficiencies are under study.

Transmutation was banned in the United States in April 1977 by U. S. President Carter due to the danger of plutonium proliferation, but President Reagan rescinded the ban in 1981. Due to economic losses and risks, the construction of reprocessing plants during this time did not resume. Due to high energy demand, work on the method has continued in the European Union (EU). This has resulted in a practical nuclear research reactor called Myrrha in which transmutation is possible. Additionally, a new research program called ACTINET has been started in the EU to make transmutation possible on an industrial scale. According to U. S. President Bush&#x27;s Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) of 2007, the United States is actively promoting research on transmutation technologies needed to markedly reduce the problem of nuclear waste treatment.

There have also been theoretical studies involving the use of fusion reactors as so-called &quot;actinide burners&quot; where a fusion reactor plasma such as in a tokamak, could be &quot;doped&quot; with a small amount of the &quot;minor&quot; transuranic atoms which would be transmuted (meaning fissioned in the actinide case) to lighter elements upon their successive bombardment by the very high energy neutrons produced by the fusion of deuterium and tritium in the reactor. A study at MIT found that only 2 or 3 fusion reactors with parameters similar to that of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) could transmute the entire annual minor actinide production from all of the light-water reactors presently operating in the United States fleet while simultaneously generating approximately 1 gigawatt of power from each reactor.

2018 Nobel Prize for Physics-winner Gérard Mourou has proposed using chirped pulse amplification to generate high-energy and low-duration laser pulses either to accelerate deuterons into a tritium target causing fusion events yielding fast neutrons, or accelerating protons for neutron spallation, with either method intended for transmutation of nuclear waste.

==== Re-use ====
Spent nuclear fuel contains abundant fertile uranium and traces of fissile materials. Methods such as the PUREX process can be used to remove useful actinides for the production of active nuclear fuel.

Another option is to find applications for the isotopes in nuclear waste so as to re-use them. Already, caesium-137, strontium-90 and a few other isotopes are extracted for certain industrial applications such as food irradiation and radioisotope thermoelectric generators. While re-use does not eliminate the need to manage radioisotopes, it can reduce the quantity of waste produced.

The Nuclear Assisted Hydrocarbon Production Method, Canadian patent application 2,659,302, is a method for the temporary or permanent storage of nuclear waste materials comprising the placing of waste materials into one or more repositories or boreholes constructed into an unconventional oil formation. The thermal flux of the waste materials fractures the formation and alters the chemical and/or physical properties of hydrocarbon material within the subterranean formation to allow removal of the altered material. A mixture of hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and/or other formation fluids is produced from the formation. The radioactivity of high-level radioactive waste affords proliferation resistance to plutonium placed in the periphery of the repository or the deepest portion of a borehole.

Breeder reactors can run on U-238 and transuranic elements, which comprise the majority of spent fuel radioactivity in the 1,000–100,000-year time span.

==== Space disposal ====
Space disposal is attractive because it removes nuclear waste from the planet. It has significant disadvantages, such as the potential for catastrophic failure of a launch vehicle, which could spread radioactive material into the atmosphere and around the world. A high number of launches would be required because no individual rocket would be able to carry very much of the material relative to the total amount that needs to be disposed. This makes the proposal economically impractical and increases the risk of one or more launch failures. To further complicate matters, international agreements on the regulation of such a program would need to be established. Costs and inadequate reliability of modern rocket launch systems for space disposal has been one of the motives for interest in non-rocket spacelaunch systems such as mass drivers, space elevators, and other proposals.

=== National management plans ===
Sweden and Finland are furthest along in committing to a particular disposal technology, while many others reprocess spent fuel or contract with France or Great Britain to do it, taking back the resulting plutonium and high-level waste. &quot;An increasing backlog of plutonium from reprocessing is developing in many countries... It is doubtful that reprocessing makes economic sense in the present environment of cheap uranium.&quot;

In many European countries (e.g., Britain, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland) the risk or dose limit for a member of the public exposed to radiation from a future high-level nuclear waste facility is considerably more stringent than that suggested by the International Commission on Radiation Protection or proposed in the United States. European limits are often more stringent than the standard suggested in 1990 by the International Commission on Radiation Protection by a factor of 20, and more stringent by a factor of ten than the standard proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository for the first 10,000 years after closure.

The U.S. EPA&#x27;s proposed standard for greater than 10,000 years is 250 times more permissive than the European limit. The U.S. EPA proposed a legal limit of a maximum of 3.5 millisieverts (350 millirem) each annually to local individuals after 10,000 years, which would be up to several percent of the exposure currently received by some populations in the highest natural background regions on Earth, though the United States Department of Energy (DOE) predicted that received dose would be much below that limit. Over a timeframe of thousands of years, after the most active short half-life radioisotopes decayed, burying U.S. nuclear waste would increase the radioactivity in the top 2000 feet of rock and soil in the United States (10 million km2) by approximately 1 part in 10 million over the cumulative amount of natural radioisotopes in such a volume, but the vicinity of the site would have a far higher concentration of artificial radioisotopes underground than such an average.

==== Mongolia ====
After serious opposition about plans and negotiations between Mongolia with Japan and the United States to build nuclear-waste facilities in Mongolia, Mongolia stopped all negotiations in September 2011. These negotiations had started after U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy Daniel Poneman visited Mongolia in September 2010. Talks took place in Washington, D.C. between officials of Japan, the United States, and Mongolia in February 2011. After this the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which wanted to buy nuclear fuel from Mongolia, joined in the negotiations. The talks were kept secret and, although the &quot;Mainichi Daily News&quot; reported on them in May, Mongolia officially denied the existence of these negotiations. Alarmed by this news, Mongolian citizens protested against the plans and demanded the government withdraw the plans and disclose information. The Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj issued a presidential order on September 13 banning all negotiations with foreign governments or international organizations on nuclear-waste storage plans in Mongolia. The Mongolian government has accused the newspaper of distributing false claims around the world. After the presidential order, the Mongolian president fired the individual who was supposedly involved in these conversations.

=== Illegal dumping ===
Authorities in Italy are investigating a &#x27;Ndrangheta mafia clan accused of trafficking and illegally dumping nuclear waste. According to a whistleblower, a manager of the Italy state energy research agency Enea paid the clan to get rid of 600 drums of toxic and radioactive waste from Italy, Switzerland, France, Germany, and the United States, with Somalia as the destination, where the waste was buried after buying off local politicians. Former employees of Enea are suspected of paying the criminals to take waste off their hands in the 1980s and 1990s. Shipments to Somalia continued into the 1990s, while the &#x27;Ndrangheta clan also blew up shiploads of waste, including radioactive hospital waste, sending them to the sea bed off the Calabrian coast. According to the environmental group Legambiente, former members of the &#x27;Ndrangheta have said that they were paid to sink ships with radioactive material for the last 20 years.

In 2008, Afghan authorities accused Pakistan of illegally dumping nuclear waste in the southern parts of Afghanistan when the Taliban were in power between 1996 and 2001. The Pakistani government denied the allegation.

== Accidents ==
A few incidents have occurred when radioactive material was disposed of improperly, shielding during transport was defective, or when it was simply abandoned or even stolen from a waste store. In the Soviet Union, waste stored in Lake Karachay was blown over the area during a dust storm after the lake had partly dried out. In Italy, several radioactive waste deposits let material flow into river water, thus contaminating water for domestic use. In France in the summer of 2008, numerous incidents happened: in one, at the Areva plant in Tricastin, it was reported that, during a draining operation, liquid containing untreated uranium overflowed out of a faulty tank and about 75 kg of the radioactive material seeped into the ground and, from there, into two rivers nearby; in another case, over 100 staff were contaminated with low doses of radiation. There are ongoing concerns around the deterioration of the nuclear waste site on the Enewetak Atoll of the Marshall Islands and a potential radioactive spill.

Scavenging of abandoned radioactive material has been the cause of several other cases of radiation exposure, mostly in developing nations, which may have less regulation of dangerous substances (and sometimes less general education about radioactivity and its hazards) and a market for scavenged goods and scrap metal. The scavengers and those who buy the material are almost always unaware that the material is radioactive and it is selected for its aesthetics or scrap value. Irresponsibility on the part of the radioactive material&#x27;s owners, usually a hospital, university, or military, and the absence of regulation concerning radioactive waste, or a lack of enforcement of such regulations, have been significant factors in radiation exposures. For an example of an accident involving radioactive scrap originating from a hospital, see the Goiânia accident.

Transportation accidents involving spent nuclear fuel from power plants are unlikely to have serious consequences due to the strength of the spent nuclear fuel shipping casks.

On 15 December 2011, top government spokesman Osamu Fujimura of the Japanese government admitted that nuclear substances were found in the waste of Japanese nuclear facilities. Although Japan did commit itself in 1977 to inspections in the safeguard agreement with the IAEA, the reports were kept secret for the inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Japan did start discussions with the IAEA about the large quantities of enriched uranium and plutonium that were discovered in nuclear waste cleared away by Japanese nuclear operators. At the press conference Fujimura said: &quot;Based on investigations so far, most nuclear substances have been properly managed as waste, and from that perspective, there is no problem in safety management,&quot; but according to him, the matter was at that moment still being investigated.

<doc id="37258" wikidata="Q212897" url="?curid=37258" title="Carol II of Romania">
<text>Carol II (4 April 1953) was King of Romania from 8 June 1930, until his forced abdication on 6 September 1940. As the eldest son of King Ferdinand I, he became crown prince upon the death of his grand-uncle, King Carol I, in 1914. He was the first of the Hohenzollern kings of Romania to be born in the country, as both of his predecessors had been born in Germany and came to Romania only as adults. As such, he was the first member of the Romanian branch of the Hohenzollerns who spoke Romanian as his first language and was also the first member of his royal family to be raised in the Orthodox faith.

Carol&#x27;s life and reign were surrounded by controversy and accusations of lack of duty, due to his desertion from the army during World War I. Another controversy was his marriage to Zizi Lambrino, which resulted in two attempts by Carol to give up the rights of succession to the royal crown of Romania, both of which were refused by his father, King Ferdinand. 

After the dissolution of his marriage, he met Princess Helen of Greece and Denmark, daughter of King Constantine I of Greece, married her in March 1921, and later that year had a son, Michael. But due to Carol&#x27;s continued affairs with Elena Lupescu he was obliged to renounce his succession rights in 1925 and leave the country. His name was subsequently removed from the royal house of Romania by King Ferdinand I. After his removal from the Royal House, Carol moved to France with Lupescu under the name Carol Caraiman. Michael, aged 5, inherited the throne on the death of King Ferdinand in 1927. Princess Helen eventually divorced Carol in 1928.

In the political crisis created by the deaths of Ferdinand I and Ion I. C. Brătianu and the ineffective regency of Prince Nicholas of Romania, Miron Cristea, and Gheorghe Buzdugan, Carol was allowed to return to Romania in 1930, and his name was restored by the royal house of Romania, dethroning his own son. The beginning of Carol’s reign was marked by the negative economic effects of the Great Depression. Carol II weakened the parliament of Romania, often appointing minority factions of historical parties to the government and attempting to form nationally concentrated governments, such as the Iorga-Argetoianu government. He also allowed for the formation of a corrupt parliament chamber around him, under the patronage of Elena Lupescu. A political crisis followed the December 1937 elections, where no party achieved an absolute majority and a coalition could not be formed because of disagreements between the National Liberal Party and the National Peasants&#x27; Party and Iron Guard whom they would have needed to form a Coalition Government. Following this crisis Carol established a royal dictatorship in 1938 by removing the 1923 constitution, abolishing all political parties, and forming a new single party, the National Renaissance Front, which consisted mostly of former members of the National Peasants&#x27; Party and National Christian Party who had been patronized by the king. The National Renaissance Front was the last of several attempts to counter the popularity of the fascist Iron Guard.

Following the start of World War II, Carol II reaffirmed the Polish–Romanian alliance; the military assistance was, however, declined by Poland, which wished to follow the Romanian Bridgehead plan that required a neutral Romania. Following the fall of Poland and the involvement of the USSR, Carol II maintained a neutrality policy. After the fall of France, Carol II&#x27;s policy changed towards re-alignment with Nazi Germany in hopes of gaining a German guarantee. He was, however, not aware of the secret clauses of the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact between Germany and the Soviet Union that would see Romania lose significant parts of its territory. The year 1940 marked the fragmentation of Greater Romania by the seceding of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the USSR, Northern Transylvania to Hungary and Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria. Although a German guarantee was finally achieved, the situation had a disastrous effect on the reputation of Carol II. The reorientation of Romania&#x27;s foreign policy towards Nazi Germany, however, would not prevent his regime from collapsing and he would be forced to abdicate by General Ion Antonescu, the newly appointed and Nazi-backed prime minister, to be succeeded by his son Michael. After his abdication, Carol was permitted to leave the country with a special train loaded with 30 truckloads of his personal fortune, which he had acquired during his time as king, and an attempt on his life was made by the Iron Guard, which fired on the train as it was passing through Timișoara station. After World War II, Carol II wanted to return to the helm of the country and dethrone his son again but was stopped by the Western Allies. For the rest of his life, he traveled the world, finally marrying Elena Lupescu while living in Brazil in 1947. After settling in the Portuguese Riviera, Carol II died peacefully at the age of 59, in exile. His son Michael I, refused to attend his funeral out of disgust for the treatment of his mother, Princess Helen by his father.

==Early life==
Carol was born in Peleș Castle and grew up under the thumb of his dominating grand-uncle, King Carol I. King Carol I largely excluded Carol&#x27;s parents, the German-born Crown Prince Ferdinand and the British-born Crown Princess Marie, from any role in bringing him up. Romania in the early 20th century had a famously relaxed &quot;Latin&quot; sexual morality, and the British Princess Marie of Edinburgh despite or perhaps because of her Victorian upbringing ended up &quot;going native&quot;, having a long series of affairs with various Romanian men with whom she could obtain more emotional and sexual satisfaction than she could with Ferdinand, who fiercely resented being cuckolded. The stern Carol I felt that Marie was unqualified to raise Prince Carol because of her affairs and her young age, as she was only seventeen when Carol was born, while Marie regarded the King as a cold, overbearing tyrant who would crush the life out of her son.

Additionally, the childless Carol I, who had always wanted a son, treated Prince Carol as his surrogate son and thoroughly spoiled him, indulging his every whim. Ferdinand was a rather shy and weak man who was easily overshadowed by the charismatic Marie, who became the most loved member of the Romanian royal family. Growing up, Carol felt ashamed of his father, whom both his grand-uncle and mother pushed around. Carol&#x27;s childhood was spent being caught up in an emotional tug-of-war between Carol I and Marie, who had very different ideas about how to raise him. The Romanian historian Marie Bucur described the battle between Carol I and Princess Marie as one between traditional 19th-century Prussian conservatism as personified by Carol I versus the 20th-century liberal, modernist, and sexually deviant values of the &quot;New Woman&quot; as personified by Princess Marie. Aspects of both Marie&#x27;s and Carol I&#x27;s personalities were present in Carol II. Largely because of the battle between the King and Marie, Carol ended up being both spoiled and deprived of love. 
==Early marriages and love affairs==
During his teenage years, Carol (Romanian for &quot;Charles&quot;) acquired the &quot;playboy&quot; image that was to become his defining persona for the rest of his life. Carol expressed some concern at the direction that Prince Carol was taking, as the young Prince&#x27;s only serious interest was stamp collecting and he spent an inordinate amount of time drinking, partying, and chasing after women. Young Carol fathered at least two illegitimate children by the teenage schoolgirl Maria Martini by the time that he was 19. Carol rapidly became a favorite of gossip columnists around the world owing to the frequent photographs that appeared in the newspapers showing him at various parties with him holding a drink in one hand and a woman in the other.

In order to teach the prince the value of Prussian virtues, the King had the prince commissioned as an officer in 1913. His time with the 1st Prussian Guards regiment did not achieve the desired results, and Carol remained the &quot;playboy prince&quot;. Romania in the early 20th century was an intensely Francophile nation, indeed perhaps the most Francophile nation in the entire world as the Romanian elite obsessively went about embracing all things French as the model for perfection in everything. To a certain extent, Carol was influenced by the prevailing Francophilia, but at the same time, he inherited from Carol I, in the words of the American historian Margaret Sankey, a &quot;profound love of German militarism&quot; and the idea that all democratic governments were weak governments.

Sometime before the First World War, the Romanian and Russian royal families held talks about the marriage of Carol, at that time the heir to the throne of the Kingdom of Romania, to the Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia, the eldest daughter of the Russian emperor at the time, Tsar Nicholas II: Sergey Sazonov, the Foreign Minister of the Russian Empire between 1910 and 1916, wanted Olga to marry Carol to ensure Romania&#x27;s position as an ally of Russia in the eventuality of a war, as Romania was an ally of Germany at the time. Both royal families, including the Tsar and his wife Alexandra, gave their support for the idea, and there were high expectations that the marriage would take place. However, neither Carol or Olga demonstrated an interest for the other: Carol wasn&#x27;t fond of Olga&#x27;s appearance, and Olga expressed her wish to remain in Russia (should the marriage have taken place, Olga would have become the Crown Princess, and later the Queen of Romania). This was best seen during the visit of the Romanian royal family to Russia in March, 1914, and during a visit of Nicholas and his family to Romania a few months later.

After the failure of the planned joining of Carol and Olga, the idea of a possible marriage of a Romanian royal to a Russian royal faded until 1917, when Carol began showing interest in the younger sister of Olga, the Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna. In a visit to Russia in January of that year, he made a formal proposal to Nicholas for Maria&#x27;s hand, but Nicholas &quot;good-naturedly laughed the proposal aside&quot;, and argued that Maria &quot;was nothing more than a schoolgirl&quot;. Maria was only 17 at the time, and shared her older sister&#x27;s desire to marry a Russian and remain in Russia.

In November 1914, Carol joined the Romanian Senate, as the 1866 Constitution guaranteed him a seat there upon reaching maturity. Known more for his romantic misadventures than for any leadership skills, Carol was first married in the Cathedral Church of Odesa, Ukraine, on August 31, 1918 (under the occupation of the Central Powers at that time), to Joanna Marie Valentina Lambrino (1898–1953), known as &quot;Zizi&quot;, the daughter of a Romanian general, Constantin Lambrino. The fact that Carol technically had deserted as he left his post at the Army without permission to marry Zizi Lambrino caused immense controversy at the time. The marriage was annulled on March 29, 1919, by the Ilfov County Court. Carol and Zizi continued to live together after the annulment. Their only child, Mircea Gregor Carol Lambrino, was born on 8 January 1920.

Carol next married Princess Helen of Greece and Denmark, who was known in Romania as Crown Princess Elena, on 10 March, 1921, in Athens, Greece. They were second cousins, both of them great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria, as well as third cousins in descent from Nicholas I of Russia. Helen had known of Carol&#x27;s dissolute behavior and previous marriage, but her love for him was undeterred. The intent behind this arranged marriage was to help organize a dynastic alliance between Greece and Romania. Bulgaria had territorial disputes with Greece, Romania, and Yugoslavia, and all three of the latter states tended to be close during the interwar period owing to their shared fears of the Bulgarians. Helen and Carol&#x27;s only child, Michael, was born seven months after their marriage, sparking rumors that Michael was conceived out of wedlock. Apparently close at first, Carol and Helen drifted apart. Carol&#x27;s marriage with Princess Helen was an unhappy one, and he frequently engaged in extramarital affairs. The elegant wallflower Helen found the bohemian Carol, with his love of heavy drinking and constant partying, rather too wild for her tastes. For his part, Carol disliked royal and aristocratic women, whom he found too stiff and formal, and had an extremely marked preference for commoners, much to the chagrin of his parents. Carol found low-born women to have the qualities that he sought in a woman, such as informality, spontaneity, humor, and passion.

==Controversies surrounding Magda Lupescu==
The marriage soon collapsed in the wake of Carol&#x27;s affair with Elena (Magda) Lupescu (1895–1977), the Roman Catholic daughter of Jewish parents who had converted to Christianity. Magda Lupescu had formerly been the wife of Army officer Ion Tâmpeanu. The National Liberal Party, which dominated Romania&#x27;s politics, made much of Carol&#x27;s relationship with Lupescu argue that he was unqualified to be king. One of the leading figures of the National Liberals was Prince Barbu Știrbey – who was also Queen Marie&#x27;s lover, and Carol had a strong dislike of Știrbey, who had humiliated his father via his indiscreetly disguised relationship with Marie, and hence of the National Liberals. Knowing that Carol was ill-disposed towards them, the National Liberals waged a sustained campaign to keep him from the throne. The campaign waged by the National Liberals had less to do with disgust with Carol&#x27;s relationship with Madame Lupescu than with an effort to remove a potential &quot;loose cannon&quot;, as Carol made it clear when he succeeded to the throne that he would not be content to let the National Liberals dominate politics in the way that the previous Hohenzollern kings had.

As a result of the scandal, Carol renounced his right to the throne on December 28, 1925, in favor of his son by Crown Princess Helen, Michael I (Mihai), who became king in July 1927 upon the death of his paternal grandfather, King Ferdinand I. Helen divorced Carol in 1928. After renouncing his right to the throne, Carol moved to Paris, where he lived openly in a common-law relationship with Madame Lupescu. The National Liberal Party was largely a vehicle for the powerful Brătianu family to exercise power and, after the National Liberal prime minister Ion I. C. Brătianu died in 1927, the Brătianu&#x27;s were unable to agree upon a successor, causing the fortunes of the National Liberals to go into decline. In the 1928 elections, the National Peasant Party under Iuliu Maniu won a resounding victory, taking 78% of the vote. As Prince Nicolae, the chief of the Regency Council that governed for King Michael, was known to be friendly with the National Liberals, the new prime minister was determined to dispose of the regency council by bringing back Carol.

==Return to the throne==

Returning to the country on 7 June, 1930, in a coup d&#x27;état engineered by National Peasant Prime Minister Iuliu Maniu, Carol was recognized by the Parliament as king of Romania the following day. For the next decade, he sought to influence the course of Romanian political life, first through manipulation of the rival Peasant and Liberal parties and anti-Semitic factions, and subsequently (January 1938) through a ministry of his own choosing. Carol also sought to build up his own personality cult against the growing influence of the Iron Guard, for instance, by setting up a paramilitary youth organization known as &quot;Straja Țării&quot; in 1935. The American historian Stanley G. Payne described Carol as &quot;the most cynical, corrupt and power-hungry monarch who ever disgraced a throne anywhere in twentieth-century Europe&quot;. A colorful character, Carol was in the words of the British historian Richard Cavendish: &quot;Dashing, willful and reckless, a lover of women, champagne and speed, Carol drove racing cars and piloted planes, and on state occasions, occasions appeared in operetta uniforms with enough ribbons, chains, and orders to sink a small destroyer.&quot;

The Romanian historian Maria Bucur wrote about Carol: 

Of course, he loved luxury; being born to privilege he expected nothing less than the grand lifestyle he saw in the other courts of Europe. Yet his style was not outlandish or grotesque like Nicolae Ceaușescu&#x27;s unique brand of kitsch. He liked things large but relatively simple – his royal palace testifies to that trait. Carol’s true passions were Lupescu, hunting, and cars and he spared no expense on them.

Carol liked to present an impressive and populist persona to the public, wearing garish military uniforms adorned with medals, and being the benefactor of every philanthropic endeavor in the country. He loved parades and grandiose festivals and watched them closely, but he was not taken in by these events as more than shows of his power. He did not take them as a show of sincere popularity as Ceaușescu did during his later years.

Carol had sworn in his coronation an oath to uphold the constitution of 1923, a promise he had no intention of keeping, and right from the start of his reign, the king meddled in politics to increase his own power. Carol was an opportunist with no real principles or values other than the belief that he was the right man to rule Romania and that what his kingdom needed was a modernizing dictatorship. Carol ruled via an informal body known as the &quot;camarilla&quot;, comprising courtiers together with senior diplomats, army officers, politicians, and industrialists, who were all in some way dependent upon royal favor to advance their careers. The most important member of the &quot;camarilla&quot; was Carol&#x27;s mistress, Madame Lupescu, whose political advice Carol greatly valued. Maniu had brought Carol to the throne out of the fear that the regency for Michael I was dominated by National Liberals, who would ensure that their party would always win the elections. Madame Lupescu was deeply unpopular with the Romanian people, and Maniu had demanded that Carol return to his wife, Princess Helen of Greece, as part of the price for being given the throne. When Carol broke his own word and continued to live with Madame Lupescu, Maniu resigned in protest in October 1930 and was to emerge as one of Carol&#x27;s leading enemies. At the same time, Carol&#x27;s return had prompted a break in the National Liberals with Gheorghe I. Brătianu breaking away to found a new party, the National Liberal Party-Brătianu that was willing to work with the new king. Despite his dislike of the National Liberals, Maniu&#x27;s enmity towards Carol left the king with no choice, but to enlist as his allies the break-away factions of the National Liberals against the National Peasants, who demanded that Carol banish Lupescu and return to his wife.

The &quot;Red Queen,&quot; as Lupescu was known to the Romanian people on account of the color of her hair, was the most hated woman in 1930s Romania. She was a woman whom ordinary Romanians saw as &quot;the embodiment of evil,&quot; in the words of the British historian Rebecca Haynes. Princess Helen was widely viewed as the wronged woman, while Lupescu was seen as the &quot;femme fatale&quot; who had stolen Carol away from the loving arms of Helen. Lupescu was Roman Catholic, but because of her parents&#x27; background, she was widely viewed as Jewish. Lupescu&#x27;s personality did not win her many friends, as she was arrogant, pushy, manipulative, and extremely greedy, with an insatiable taste for buying the most expensive French clothes, cosmetics, and jewelry. At a time when many Romanians were suffering from the Great Depression in Romania, Carol&#x27;s habit of indulging Lupescu&#x27;s expensive tastes caused much resentment, with many of Carol&#x27;s subjects grumbling that the money would have been better spent on alleviating poverty in the kingdom. Further adding to Lupescu&#x27;s immense unpopularity, she was a businesswoman who used her connections to the Crown to engage in dubious transactions that usually involved large sums of public money – going into her pocket. However, the contemporary viewpoint that Carol was a mere puppet of Lupescu is incorrect, and Lupescu&#x27;s influence on political decision-making was much exaggerated at the time. Lupescu was primarily interested in enriching herself to support her extravagant lifestyle and had no real interest in politics, beyond protecting her ability to engage in corruption. Unlike Carol, Lupescu had utterly no interest in social policy or foreign affairs and was such a self-absorbed narcissist that she was unaware of just how unpopular she was with ordinary people. Carol by contrast was interested in the affairs of the state, and though he never sought to deny his relationship with Lupescu, he was careful not to display her too much in public, as he knew that this would bring him unpopularity.

Carol sought to play the National Liberals, the National Peasant Party, and the Iron Guard off against each other with the ultimate aim of making himself master of Romanian politics and disposing of all the parties in Romania. With regards to the Legion of the Archangel Michael, Carol had no intention of ever letting the Iron Guard come to power, but insofar as the Legion was a disruptive force that weakened both the National Liberals and the National Peasants, Carol welcomed the rise of the Iron Guard in the early 1930s, and he sought to use the Legion for his own ends. On 30, 1933, the Iron Guard assassinated the National Liberal prime minister, Ion G. Duca, which led to the first of several bans placed on the Legion. The assassination of Ion Duca, which was Romania&#x27;s first political murder since 1862, shocked Carol, who saw the willingness of Codreanu to order the assassination of the Prime Minister as a clear sign that the egomaniacal Codreanu was getting out of control and that Codreanu would not play the role assigned by the king as a disruptive force threatening the National Liberals and National Peasants alike. In 1934, when Codreanu was brought to trial for ordering Duca&#x27;s assassination, he used as his defense the argument that the entire Francophile elite was completely corrupt and not properly Romanian, and as such, Duca was just another corrupt National Liberal politician who deserved to die. The jury acquitted Codreanu, an act that worried Carol as it showed that Codreanu&#x27;s revolutionary message that the entire elite needed to be destroyed was winning popular approval. In the spring of 1934, after Codreanu was acquitted, Carol, together with Bucharest police prefect Gavrilă Marinescu and Madame Lupescu, were involved in a half-hearted plot to kill Codreanu by poisoning his coffee, an effort that was abandoned before being attempted. Until 1935, Carol was a leading contributor to the &quot;Friends of the Legion&quot;, the group that collected contributions to the Legion. Carol only stopped contributing to the Legion after Codreanu started calling Lupescu a &quot;Jewish whore&quot;. Carol&#x27;s image was always that of &quot;the playboy king&quot;, a hedonistic monarch more interested in womanizing, drinking, gambling, and partying, than in affairs of state, and to the extent that he cared about politics, Carol was viewed as a scheming, dishonest man only interested in wrecking the democratic system to seize power for himself.

==Personality cult==

To compensate for his rather negative and well-deserved &quot;playboy king&quot; image, Carol created a lavish personality cult around himself that grew more extreme as his reign went on, which portrayed the king as a Christ-like being &quot;chosen&quot; by God to create a &quot;new Romania&quot;. In the 1934 book &quot;The Three Kings&quot; by Cezar Petrescu, which was intended for a less educated audience, Carol was constantly described as being almost god-like, the &quot;father of the villagers and workers of the land&quot; and the &quot;king of culture&quot; who was the greatest of all the Hohenzollern kings and whose return from exile from France via airplane in June 1930 was a &quot;descent from the heavens&quot;. Petrescu depicted Carol&#x27;s return as the beginning of his God-appointed task of becoming &quot;the maker of eternal Romania&quot;, the start of a glorious golden age as Petrescu asserted that rule by monarchs was what God wanted for Romanians.

Carol had little understanding of or interest in economics, but his most influential economic advisor was Mihail Manoilescu who favored a statist model of economic development with the state intervening in the economy to encourage growth. Carol was very active in the cultural realm, being a generous patron of the arts and actively supporting the work of the Royal Foundation, an organization with a broad mandate to promote and study Romanian culture in all fields. In particular, Carol supported the work of the sociologist Dimitrie Gusti of the Social Service of the Royal Foundation, who in the early 1930s started to bring social scientists from various disciplines like sociology, anthropology, ethnography, geography, musicology, medicine, and biology together in a &quot;science of the nation&quot;. Gusti took teams of professors from various disciplines to the countryside to study an entire community from all vantage points every summer, who then produce a lengthy report about the community.

==Political influence==
For most of the interwar period, Romania was in the French sphere of influence, and in June 1926, a defensive alliance was signed with France. The alliance with France, together with an alliance with Poland signed in 1921, and the &quot;Little Entente,&quot; which united Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, were the cornerstones of Romanian foreign policy. Starting in 1919, the French sought to create the &quot;Cordon sanitaire&quot; that would keep both Germany and the Soviet Union out of Eastern Europe. Carol did not seek to replace the foreign policy he had inherited in 1930 at first, as he regarded the continuation of the &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; as the best guarantee of Romania&#x27;s independence and territorial integrity, and as such, his foreign policy was essentially pro-French. At the time that Romania signed the alliance with France, the Rhineland region of Germany was demilitarized, and the thinking in Bucharest had always been that if Germany should commit any act of aggression anywhere in Eastern Europe, the French would begin an offensive into the &quot;Reich&quot;. Starting in 1930, when the French began to build the Maginot Line along their border with Germany, some doubts started to be expressed in Bucharest about whether the French might actually come to Romania&#x27;s aid in the event of a German aggression. In 1933, Carol had Nicolae Titulescu, an outspoken champion of collective security under the banner of the League of Nations, appointed foreign minister with instructions to use principles of collective security as the building blocks for creating some sort of security structure intended to keep both Germany and the Soviet Union out of Eastern Europe. Carol and Titulescu personally disliked one another, but Carol wanted Titulescu as a foreign minister as he believed he was the best man for strengthening ties with France and for bringing Great Britain into the affairs of Eastern Europe under the guise of the collective security commitments contained the League Covenant.

The process of &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; (coordination) in National Socialist Germany did not extend only to the &quot;Reich but&quot; was rather thought of by the National Socialist leadership as a worldwide process in which the NSDAP would take control over all of the ethnic German communities around the entire world. The Foreign Policy Department of the NSDAP, headed by Alfred Rosenberg, had attempted to take over the &quot;Volk Deutsch&quot; (ethnic German) community in Romania starting in 1934, a policy that greatly offended Carol, who regarded this as outrageous German interference in Romania&#x27;s internal affairs. As Romania had half a million &quot;Volk Deutsch&quot; citizens in the 1930s, the Nazi campaign to take over the German community in Romania was a real concern for Carol, who feared that the German minority might become a fifth column. In addition, Rosenberg&#x27;s agents had established contracts with the Romanian extreme right, most notably with the National Christian Party headed by Octavian Goga and less substantial links with the Iron Guard headed by Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, which further annoyed Carol. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote about Carol&#x27;s foreign policy views: &quot;He admired and feared Germany, but feared and disliked the Soviet Union.&quot;. The fact that the first leader to visit Nazi Germany (albeit not in an official capacity) was the Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Gömbös, who during his visit to Berlin in October 1933 signed an economic treaty that placed Hungary within the German economic sphere of influence – was a source of much alarm to Carol. For the entire interwar period, Budapest refused to recognize the frontiers imposed by the Treaty of Trianon and laid claim to Transylvania region of Romania. Carol, like the rest of the Romanian elite, was worried by the prospect of an alliance of the revisionist states that rejected the legitimacy of the international order created by the Allies in 1918–20, indicating that Germany would support Hungary&#x27;s claims to Transylvania. Hungary had territorial disputes with Romania, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia, all of which happened to be allies of France. Accordingly, Franco–Hungarian relations were extremely bad during the interwar period, and so – it seemed natural that Hungary would ally itself with France&#x27;s archenemy, Germany.

In 1934, Titulescu played a leading role in creating the Balkan Entente which brought together Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey in an alliance intended to counter Bulgarian revanchism. The Balkan Entente was intended to be the beginning of an alliance that would bring together all of the anti-revisionist states of Eastern Europe. Like France, Romania was allied to both Czechoslovakia and Poland, but because of the Teschen dispute in Silesia, Warsaw and Prague were bitter enemies. Like the diplomats of the Quai d&#x27;Orsay, Carol was exasperated by the bitter Polish-Czechoslovak dispute, arguing that it was absurd for anti-revisionist Eastern European states to be feuding with one another in the face of the rise of German and Soviet powers. Several times, Carol attempted to mediate the Teschen dispute and thus end the Polish-Czechoslovak feud without much success. Reflecting his initially pro-French orientation, in June 1934, when the French foreign minister Louis Barthou visited Bucharest to meet with the foreign ministers of &quot;the Little Entente&quot; of Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, Carol organized lavish celebrations to welcome Barthou that were made to symbolize the enduring Franco-Romanian friendship between the two &quot;Latin sisters.&quot;. The German minister to Romania, Count Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg complained with disgust in a report to Berlin that everyone in the Romanian elite was an incurable Francophile who told him that Romania would never betray its &quot;Latin sister&quot; France.

At the same time, Carol also considered the possibility that if Romanian-German relations were improved, then perhaps Berlin could be persuaded not to support Budapest in its campaign to regain Transylvania. Further pressing Carol towards Germany was the desperate state of the Romanian economy: even before the worldwide Great Depression, Romania had been a poor country, and the Great Depression hit Romania hard, with Romanians being unable to export much owing to the global trade war set off by the American Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which in turn led to a decline in the value of the &quot;Leu&quot; as Romania&#x27;s reserves of foreign exchange were being used up. In June 1934, Romanian finance minister Victor Slăvescu visited Paris to ask the French to inject millions of francs into the Romanian treasury and to lower their tariffs on Romanian goods. When the French refused both requests, an annoyed Carol wrote in his diary that the &quot;Latin sister&quot; France was behaving in a less than sisterly way towards Romania. In April 1936, when Wilhelm Fabricius was appointed German minister in Bucharest, the Foreign Minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath in his instructions to the new minister, described Romania as an unfriendly, pro-French state but suggested that the prospect of more trade with the &quot;Reich&quot; might bring the Romanians out of the French orbit. Neurath further instructed Fabricius that while Romania was not a major power in a military sense, it was a state of crucial importance to Germany because of its oil.

Carol often encouraged splits in the political parties to his own ends. In 1935, Alexandru Vaida-Voevod, the leader of the Transylvanian branch of the National Peasants, broke away to form the Romanian Front with Carol&#x27;s encouragement. During the same time, Carol developed close contacts with Armand Călinescu, an ambitious National Peasant leader who founded a faction opposed to the leadership of Carol&#x27;s archenemy, Iuliu Maniu, and wanted the National Peasants to work with the Crown. In the same way, Carol encouraged the &quot;Young Liberal&quot; faction headed by Gheorghe Tătărescu as a way of weakening the power of the Brătianu family, who dominated the National Liberals. Pointedly, Carol was willing to allow the &quot;Young Liberal&quot; faction under Tătărescu to come to power, but excluded the main National Liberal faction under the leadership of Dinu Brătianu from obtaining power; Carol had not forgotten how the Brătianus had excluded him from the succession in the 1920s.

In February 1935, the Legion&#x27;s leader, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, who until then had been regarded as an ally of Carol, for the first time attacked the king directly when he organized demonstrations outside of the royal palace attacking Carol after Dr. Dimitrie Gerota had been imprisoned for writing an article exposing the corrupt business dealings of Lupescu. Codreanu, in his speech before the Royal Palace called Lupescu a &quot;Jewish whore&quot; who was robbing Romania blind, which led to an insulted Carol calling on one of the members of his &quot;camarilla&quot;, the Bucharest police prefect Gavrilă Marinescu, who sent the police out to break up the Iron Guard rally with much violence.

The doubts about the French willingness to undertake an offensive against Germany were further reinforced by the Remilitarization of the Rhineland in March 1936, which had the effect of allowing the Germans to start building the Siegfried line along the border with France, something that considerably lessened the prospect of a French offensive into western Germany if the &quot;Reich&quot; should invade any of the states of the &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot;. A British Foreign Office memo from March 1936 stated that the only nations in the world that would apply sanctions on Germany for remilitarizing the Rhineland if the League of Nations should vote for such a step were Britain, France, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and Romania. In the aftermath of the remilitarization of the Rhineland, and once it was clear that no sanctions were going to be applied against Germany, Carol started to voice his fears that the days of French influence in Eastern Europe were numbered and Romania might have to seek some understanding with Germany to preserve its independence. After continuing the alliance with France, Carol also began a policy of attempting to improve relations with Germany.

On the domestic front, in the summer of 1936, Codreanu and Maniu formed an alliance to oppose the growing power of the Crown and the National Liberal government. In August 1936, Carol had Titulescu fired as foreign minister, and in November 1936, Carol sent the renegade National Liberal politician Gheorghe I. Brătianu to Germany to meet with Adolf Hitler, the Foreign Minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath and Hermann Göring to tell them of Romania&#x27;s desire for a rapprochement with the &quot;Reich&quot;. Carol was much relieved when Brătianu reported that Hitler, Neurath, and Göring had all reassured him that the &quot;Reich&quot; had no interest in supporting Hungarian revanchism and was neutral on the Transylvania dispute. The decoupling of Berlin&#x27;s campaign to overthrow the international system created by the Treaty of Versailles from Budapest&#x27;s campaign to overthrow the system created by the Treaty of Trianon was welcome news to Carol, creating the possibility that a greater Germany would not mean a greater Hungary. Göring, the newly appointed chief of the Four Year Plan organization designed to have Germany ready to wage a total war by 1940, was especially interested in Romania&#x27;s oil and talked much to Brătianu about a new era of German-Romanian economic relations. Germany had almost no oil of its own, and throughout the Third Reich, control of Romania&#x27;s oil was a key foreign policy goal. Reflecting the changed emphasis, Carol vetoed in February 1937 a plan promoted by France and Czechoslovakia for a new alliance that would formally unite France with the Little Entente and envisioned much closer military ties between the French and their allies in Eastern Europe. Because of its oil, the French were keen to keep the alliance with Romania strong, and because Romania&#x27;s manpower was a way of compensating the French for their lower population vs. Germany&#x27;s (the French had 40 million people while Germany had 70 million people). Additionally, it was assumed in Paris that if Germany invaded Czechoslovakia Hungary would also attack Czechoslovakia to regain Slovakia and Ruthenia. French military planners envisioned the role of Romania and Yugoslavia in such a war as invading Hungary to relieve the pressure on Czechoslovakia.

Until 1940, Carol&#x27;s foreign policy teetered uneasily between the traditional alliance with France and an alignment with the newly ascending power of Germany. In the summer of 1937, Carol told French diplomats that if Germany attacked Czechoslovakia, he would not allow the Red Army transit rights across Romania but was willing to ignore the Soviets if they crossed Romanian airspace on their way to Czechoslovakia. On December 9, 1937, a German-Romanian economic treaty was signed that placed Romania within the German economic sphere of influence but left the Germans unsatisfied as the &quot;Reich&quot;&#x27;s enormous demand for oil to power its increasingly large war machine, was not yet fulfilled by the 1937 treaty. Germany had a tremendous need for oil and no sooner had the 1937 agreement been signed than the Germans asked for a new economic treaty in 1938. At the same time that the German-Romanian treaty was signed in December 1937, Carol was receiving the French Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos to show that the alliance with France was not yet dead.

==The 1937 election and the Goga government==
In September 1937, Carol paid an extended visit to Paris, during which he indicated to the French Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos that Romanian democracy would soon end. In a campaign speech for the general elections due that December, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, &quot;Captain&quot; of the Archangel Michael Legion, called for an end to the alliance with France and stated: &quot;I am for a Romanian foreign policy with Rome and Berlin. I am with the states of the National Revolution against Bolshevism. Within forty-eight hours of a Legionary movement victory, Romania will have an alliance with Rome and Berlin&quot;. Without realizing it, Codreanu had sealed his doom with that speech. Carol had always insisted that control of foreign policy was his own exclusive royal prerogative, which no one else was allowed to interfere with. Despite the constitution, which stated that the foreign minister was responsible to the prime minister, in practice, the foreign ministers had always reported to the king. By challenging Carol&#x27;s right to control foreign policy, Codreanu had crossed the Rubicon in the king&#x27;s eyes and from that time on, Carol was committed to the destruction of the arrogant upstart Codreanu and his movement who had dared to challenge the king&#x27;s prerogative. In the December 1937 elections, the National Liberal government of Prime Minister Gheorghe Tătărescu won the largest number of seats, but less than the 40% required to form a majority government in parliament. After assassinating Prime Minister Duca in 1933, the Iron Guard had been banned from participating in elections, and to get around the ban Codreanu founded the All for Fatherland! party as a front for the Legion. The All for Fatherland! the party won 16% of the vote in the 1937 election, marking the high point of the Iron Guard&#x27;s electoral success.

On 28, 1937, Carol swore in the radical anti-Semitic poet Octavian Goga of the National Christian Party, which only won 9% of the vote, as prime minister. Carol&#x27;s reasons for appointing Goga Prime Minister were partly because he hoped that anti-Semitic policies Goga would bring in would win him support from the All for Fatherland! voters and thus weaken the Legion and partly because he hoped that Goga would prove so incompetent as prime minister as to provoke such a crisis that would allow him to seize power for himself. Carol wrote in his diary that the markedly stupid Goga could not possibly last long as prime minister and that Goga&#x27;s failure would allow him to &quot;be free to take stronger measures which will free me and the country from the tyranny of party interests&quot;. Carol agreed to Goga&#x27;s request to dissolve parliament for new elections on 18, 1938. As leader of the fourth party in parliament, Goga&#x27;s government was certain to be defeated on a vote of no-confidence when parliament convened as the National Liberals, National Peasants and All for the Fatherland Party had all come out against Goga, albeit for very different reasons. The election got off to a violent start with a brawl in Bucharest between Goga&#x27;s &quot;Lăncieri&quot; paramilitary group and the Iron Guard that left two dead, 52 hospitalized and 450 people arrested. The 1938 election was one of the most violent elections in Romanian history, as the Iron Guard and &quot;Lăncieri&quot; battled one another for control of the streets while seeking to establish their anti-Semitic creditations by assaulting Jews. As Parliament never met during the Goga government, Goga had to pass laws via emergency decree, which all had to be countersigned by the king.

The harsh anti-Semitic policies of the Goga government impoverished the Jewish minority and led to immediate complaints from the British, French and American governments that Goga&#x27;s policies were going to lead to a Jewish exodus out of Romania. Neither Britain, France, nor the United States had any wish to take in the Jewish refugees that Goga was creating by imposing increasingly oppressive anti-Semitic laws, and all three governments pressed for Carol to dismiss Goga as a way of nipping the developing humanitarian crisis caused by Goga in the bud. The British minister Sir Reginald Hoare and French minister Adrien Thierry both submitted notes of protest against the Goga government&#x27;s anti-Semitism, while President Roosevelt of the United States wrote a letter to Carol complaining about the anti-Semitic policies he was tolerating. On 12, 1938, Goga stripped all Romanian Jews of their Romanian citizenship, a preparatory move towards Goga&#x27;s ultimate goal of the expulsion of all Romanian Jews. Carol was personally not an anti-Semite, but in the words of his biographer, Paul D. Quinlan, the king was &quot;simply indifferent&quot; to the sufferings of his Jewish subjects caused by Goga&#x27;s oppressive anti-Semitic laws. The opportunistic Carol did not believe in antisemitism anymore than he believed in anything else other than power, but if &quot;raison d&#x27;état&quot; meant tolerating an anti-Semitic government as the price of gaining power, Carol was quite prepared to sacrifice the rights of his Jewish subjects. At the same time, Goga proved himself a better poet than politician, and there was a crisis atmosphere in early 1938 as the Goga government, which obsessed with solving the &quot;Jewish Question&quot;, to the exclusion of everything else, was clearly floundering. Weinberg wrote about Goga, saying that he was &quot;Unprepared for office and untouched by any leadership ability...&quot; and whose clownish antics left diplomats stationed in Bucharest &quot;half-amused, half-appalled&quot;. As Carol had expected, Goga proved to be such an inept leader as to discredit democracy while his anti-Semitic policies ensured that none of the democratic great powers would object to Carol proclaiming a dictatorship.

==The Royal Dictatorship==
Coming to realize belatedly that he was being used by Carol, Goga had a meeting with Codreanu on 8 February 1938, at the house of Ion Gigurtu to arrange for a deal under which the Iron Guard would withdraw its candidates from the election in order to ensure that the radical anti-Semitic right would have a majority. Carol quickly learned of the Goga-Codreanu pact and used it as the justification for the self-coup he had been planning since late 1937. On 10 February 1938, Carol suspended the Constitution and seized emergency powers. Carol proclaimed martial law and suspended all civil liberties under the grounds that the violent election campaign was at the risk of plunging the nation into civil war.

Having outlived his usefulness, Goga was sacked as prime minister and Carol appointed Patriarch Elie Cristea, the head of the Romanian Eastern Orthodox Church, as his successor. Carol knew he would command wide respect in a country where the majority of the population was Orthodox. On 11, 1938, Carol drafted a new constitution. Although it was superficially similar to its 1923 predecessor, it was actually a severely authoritarian and corporatist document. The new constitution effectively codified the emergency powers Carol had seized in February, turning his government into a de facto legal dictatorship. It concentrated virtually all governing power in his hands, almost to the point of absolute monarchy. The new constitution was approved in a plebiscite held under far-from-secret conditions; voters were required to appear before an election bureau and verbally state whether they approved the constitution; silence was deemed as a &quot;yes&quot; vote. Under these conditions, an implausible 99.87 percent were reported as having approved the new charter, against fewer than 5,500 votes against it.

At the time of his coup in February 1938, Carol informed the German minister Wilhelm Fabricius of his wish for closer ties between his country and Germany. Thierry told Carol in a meeting after the coup that his new government was &quot;well received&quot; in Paris and that the French would not allow the end of democracy to affect their relations with Romania. The new government of Patriarch Cristea did not introduce new anti-Semitic laws but did not repeal the laws passed by Goga either, though Cristea was less extreme about enforcing these laws. When asked by a Jewish friend if his citizenship would be restored now that Goga was gone, Interior Minister Armand Călinescu, who detested the Iron Guard and antisemitism, replied that the Cristea government had no interest in restoring citizenship back to the Jews.

In March 1938, Armand Călinescu, the Interior Minister who had emerged as one of Carol&#x27;s closet allies and who was to serve as the &quot;strong man&quot; of the new regime, demanded the Iron Guard be finally destroyed. In April 1938, Carol moved to crush the Iron Guard by having Codreanu imprisoned for libeling the historian Nicolae Iorga after Codreanu had published a public letter accusing Iorga of dishonest business dealings. After Codreanu&#x27;s conviction on 19 April 1938, he was convicted again in a second trial on 27 May 1938, of high treason where he was accused of working in the pay of Germany to affect a revolution since 1935 and sentenced to 10 years in prison.

Carol was made a Stranger Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter in 1938 (the 982nd member since the order&#x27;s inception) by his second cousin, George VI (King of the United Kingdom). In 1937, he was awarded the Grand Cross of Justice of the Military and Hospitaler Order of Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem and given the Grand Collar of the Order on 16 October 1938. He served as the Grand Bailiwick of the budding Grand Bailiwick of Romania.

Carol, together with the rest of the Romanian elite, was deeply shocked by the Munich Agreement of 30 September 1938, which he saw as allowing all of Eastern Europe to fall within the German sphere of influence. Romania had long been one of the most Francophile nations in the world, which meant that the effects of Munich were felt especially strongly there. Weinberg wrote about the effect of Munich on Franco-Romanian relations: &quot;In view of the traditional ties going back to the beginnings of Romanian independence and manifested in the way in which the Romanian elite looked to France as the model for everything from fashion to government, the revelation of France&#x27;s abdication was particularly shocking.&quot; In October 1938, the Iron Guard had begun a terrorist campaign of assassinating police officers and bureaucrats and staging bombings of government offices as part of an effort to overthrow Carol. Carol struck back hard, ordering the police to arrest Iron Guardsmen without warrant and to summarily execute those found with weapons.

In view of Germany&#x27;s desperate need for oil and the repeated German requests for a new economic agreement that would allow for more Romanian oil to be shipped to the &quot;Reich&quot;, Carol met Fabricius to tell him that he wanted such an agreement to create a lasting understanding between Germany and Romania. At the same time, in October–November 1938, Carol was playing a double game and appealed to Britain for help, offering to place Romania within the British economic sphere of influence, and visited London between 15 and 20 November to hold unsuccessful talks on that subject. On 24 November 1938, Carol visited Germany to meet with Hitler in order to improve German-Romanian relations. During the talks for the new German-Romanian economic agreement, which was signed on 10 December 1938, Weinberg wrote that &quot;Carol made the needed concessions, but he demonstrated his concern for his country&#x27;s independence by driving a very hard bargain.&quot;. The British historian D.C. Watt wrote that Carol had a &quot;trump card&quot; in his control of the oil Germany needed so badly and that the Germans were willing to pay a very high price for Romanian oil, without which their military could not function. During his summit with Hitler, Carol was much offended when Hitler demanded that Carol free Codreanu and appoint him prime minister. Carol believed that as long as Codreanu lived, there was a possible alternative leadership in Romania for Hitler to back, and that if this possibility was eliminated then Hitler would have no choice other than to deal with him.
Carol had initially planned to keep Codreanu in prison, but after the terrorist campaign began in October 1938, Carol agreed to Călinescu&#x27;s plan drawn up in the spring to murder all of the Iron Guard leaders in custody. On the night of 30 November 1938, Carol had Codreanu and 13 other Iron Guard leaders murdered, with the official story being that they were &quot;shot while trying to escape.&quot;. The killings on the night of 30 November 1938, which saw much of the Iron Guard&#x27;s leadership wiped out, have gone down in Romanian history as &quot;the night of the vampires.&quot;. The Germans were much offended by the murder of Codreanu and for a period in late 1938 waged a violent propaganda campaign against Carol, with German newspapers regularly running stories casting doubt about the official version of events that Codreanu had been &quot;shot while trying to escape&quot; while calling Codreanu&#x27;s murder &quot;a victory for the Jews,&quot; but ultimately economic concerns, especially the German need for Romanian oil caused the Nazis to get over their outrage over the killings of the Iron Guard leaders by early 1939, and relations with Carol soon went back to normal.

In December 1938, the National Renaissance Front was formed as the country&#x27;s only legal party. That same month, Carol appointed his friend since childhood and another member of the &quot;camarilla,&quot; Grigore Gafencu as foreign minister. Gafencu was appointed foreign minister partly because Carol knew he could trust Gafencu and partly because of Gafencu&#x27;s friendship with Colonel Józef Beck, the Polish foreign minister, as Carol wanted to strengthen ties with Poland. Gafencu was to prove himself something of an opportunist as foreign minister, the man who always wanted to take the path of least resistance, in marked contrast to Armand Călinescu, the tough, &quot;almost freakish-looking,&quot; diminutive, one-eyed Interior Minister (and soon to be prime minister) who proved himself a consistent opponent of fascism both in Romania and abroad and encouraged Carol to stand with the Allies. 

Carol&#x27;s foreign policy going into 1939 was to strengthen Romania&#x27;s alliances with Poland and the Balkan Entente, work to avoid conflicts with Romania&#x27;s enemies Hungary and Bulgaria, and encourage Britain and France to get involved in the Balkans while trying to avoid giving offense to Germany. On 6 March 1939, the Patriarch Cristea died and was replaced as prime minister by Călinescu.

In February 1939, Göring dispatched his deputy Helmuth Wohlthat of the Four Year Plan organization to Bucharest with instructions to sign yet another German-Romanian economic treaty that would allow Germany total economic dominance over Romania, especially its oil industry. That Wohlthat, the number two man in the Four-Year Plan organization, was sent to Bucharest indicated the importance of the German-Romanian talks. Carol had resisted German demands for more oil in the December 1938 agreement and instead had succeeded by early 1939 in placing Romania to a certain extent within the British economic sphere of influence. To counterbalance the increasingly powerful German influence in the Balkans, Carol wanted closer ties with Britain. At the same time, the Four-Year Plan was running into major difficulties by early 1939, and in particular, Göring&#x27;s plans to have synthetic oil plants that would make oil from coal were well behind schedule. The new technology of making synthetic oil from lignite coal had run into major technical problems and cost overruns, and Göring had been informed in early 1939 that the synthetic oil plants whose construction had started in 1936 would not be operative by 1940 as planned. It was not until the summer of 1942 that Germany&#x27;s first synthetic oil plants finally started operating. It was painfully obvious to Göring in the first months of 1939 that the German economy would not be ready to support a total war by 1940 as the Four-Year Plan of 1936 had envisioned while at the same time his economic experts were telling him the &quot;Reich&quot; needed to import 400,000 tons of oil per month while Germany had in fact imported only 61,000 tons of oil per month in the last four months of 1938.

In 1938, Romania produced 6.6 million tons of crude oil, 284,000 tons of crude steel, 133,000 tons of pig iron, 510,000 tons of cement and 289,000 tons of rolled steel.

Hence Wohlthat demanded during his talks with Romanian Foreign Minister Grigore Gafencu that Romania nationalize their entire oil industry, which was henceforth controlled by a new corporation owned jointly by the German and Romanian governments, while demanding Romania &quot;respect German export interests&quot; by only selling their oil to Germany. In addition, Wohlthat demanded a host of other measures that, to all practical purposes, would have converted Romania into a German economic colony. As Carol had no intention of giving in to these demands, the talks in Bucharest went very badly. It was at this point that Carol began what became known as the &quot;Tilea affair&quot; when, on 17 March 1939, Virgil Tilea, the Romanian minister in London, burst unexpectedly into the office of the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax in an agitated state to announce that his country was faced with an imminent German invasion and asked Halifax for British support. At the same time, Carol mobilized five infantry corps on the Hungarian border to guard the supposed invasion. The British &quot;economic offensive&quot; in the Balkans was causing Germany very real economic pain as the British bought up Romanian oil that the Germans badly needed, hence their demands for control of the Romanian oil industry that so offended Carol. As the British believed in Tilea&#x27;s claims, the &quot;Tilea affair&quot; had an immense impact on British foreign policy and led to the Chamberlain government changing from appeasement of Germany to a policy of &quot;containing&quot; the &quot;Reich&quot;. Carol denied, unconvincingly, knowing anything about what Tilea was up to in London, but the British warnings to Germany against invading Romania in March 1939 led the Germans to relax their demands, and the latest German-Romanian economic treaty signed on 23 March 1939, was, in the words of Watt &#x27;very vague&quot;. Despite the &quot;Tilea affair&quot;, Carol had decided that he would refuse to become involved in any diplomacy that would force him to decisively choose between Germany and Britain, and he would never accept any support from the Soviet Union to deter Germany.
As part of their new policy of seeking to &quot;contain&quot; Germany starting in March 1939, the British sought the construction of the &quot;peace front,&quot; which was to comprise at a minimum Britain, France, Poland, the Soviet Union, Turkey, Romania, Greece and Yugoslavia. For his part, Carol was obsessed with fears in the first half of 1939 that Hungary, with German support, would soon attack his kingdom. On 6 April 1939, a cabinet meeting decided that Romania would not join the &quot;peace front&quot; but would seek Anglo-French support for its independence. The same meeting decided that Romania would work to strengthen ties with other Balkan nations but would seek to prevent the Anglo-French efforts to link the security of the Balkans to the security of Poland. On April 13, 1939, the British prime minister Neville Chamberlain speaking in the House of Commons and the French Premier Édouard Daladier speaking in the Chamber of Deputies, announced a joint Anglo-French &quot;guarantee&quot; of the independence of Romania and Greece. Carol promptly accepted the &quot;guarantee.&quot;. On 5 May 1939, the French Marshal Maxime Weygand visited Bucharest to meet with Carol and his prime minister, Armand Călinescu to discuss Romania&#x27;s possible participation in the &quot;peace front.&quot;. Both Carol and Călinescu were supportive but evasive, saying that they would welcome having the Soviet Union fight against Germany, but would never allow the Red Army to enter Romania even if Germany should invade. Carol told Weygand: &quot;I do not wish to let my country be engaged in a war which would result, in a few weeks, in the destruction of its army and the occupation of its territory...We do not wish to be the lighting conductor for the coming storm&quot;. Carol went on to complain that he had enough equipment for only two-thirds of his army, which also lacked tanks, anti-aircraft guns, heavy artillery and anti-tank guns while his air force had only about 400 antiquated aircraft of French manufacture that were no match for latest German aircraft. Weygand reported to Paris that Carol wanted Anglo–French support, but would not fight for the Allies if war came.

On 11 May 1939, an Anglo-Romanian agreement was signed under which Britain committed itself to grant Romania a credit of £5 million pound sterling and promised to buy 200,000 tons of Romanian wheat at above-market prices. When Yugoslavia reacted negatively to the Anglo-Turkish Declaration of 12 May 1939, promising to &quot;ensure the establishment of security in the Balkans&quot; and threatening to pull out of the Balkan Pact, Gafencu had a summit with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Aleksandar Cincar-Marković on 21 May 1939, at the Iron Gates to ask the Yugoslavs to stay in the Balkan Pact. However, Cincar-Marković&#x27;s talk of leaving the Balkan Pact turned out to be a ploy by the Yugoslav Regent, Prince Paul, who was backing a plan mooted by the Turkish Foreign Minister Şükrü Saracoğlu to have Bulgaria join the Balkan Pact in exchange for Romania ceding part of the Dobruja region. In a letter to Carol, Paul stated that he wanted the Bulgarians &quot;off my back&quot; as he was afraid of the Italians building up their forces in their new colony of Albania and asked his friend to make this concession for him. Carol stated in response that it was out of the question for him to cede any territory to Bulgarians, partly because he was against giving any of his realm on principle and partly because to cede the Dobrudja would only encourage the Hungarians to renew their claims on Transylvania.

Despite his formal opposition to joining the &quot;peace front,&quot; Carol did decide to strengthen the Balkan Entente, especially to strengthen ties with Turkey. Since Britain and France were working for an alliance with Turkey while at the same time holding talks with the Soviet Union, Carol reasoned that if Romania was to be firmly allied to Turkey, this would be a way of associating Romania with the emerging &quot;peace front&quot; without actually joining it. Despite the way in which Carol disappointed Paul, he very much wanted to strengthen Yugoslav-Romanian relations as Yugoslavia was one of Romania&#x27;s few friendly neighbors. He was awarded the Yugoslav Order of Karađorđe&#x27;s Star. To resist Bulgarian claims on the Dubrujda, Carol also wanted better relations with Bulgaria&#x27;s archenemy, Greece.

In July 1939, the king had a major clash with Fritz Fabritius, the leader of the Nazified German National Party, which was the largest of the &quot;Volk Deutsch&quot; parties and which joined the National Renaissance Front in January 1939. Fabritius had taken to calling himself the &quot;Führer&quot;, had formed two para-military groups, the National Workers Front and the German Youth, and was holding ceremonies in which members of Romania&#x27;s 800,000 strong German minority had to swear personal oaths of loyalty to him. In early July, Fabritius, during a visit to Munich, gave a speech in which he stated that the Romanian &quot;Volk Deutsch&quot; were loyal to Germany, not Romania, and spoke of his wish to see a &quot;Greater German &quot;Reich,&quot;&quot; which would be secured by armed peasant settlements along the Carpathians, Ural, and Caucasus mountains. In this &quot;Grossraum&quot; (an untranslatable German word meaning roughly &quot;greater space&quot;), only Germans would be allowed to live, and those not willing to be Germanized would have to leave. In response to this speech, when Fabritius returned to Romania, he was summoned to a meeting with Călinescu on 13 July, who told him that the king had enough and was going to take action against him. Fabritius promised to behave, but was expelled from Romania shortly afterwards when one of his staffers accidentally left on a train a briefcase full of documents showing Fabritius&#x27;s supporters were arming themselves and that &quot;Führer&quot; Fabritius was being financed by Germany.

In July 1939, when Carol heard rumors that Hungary, supported by Germany, was planning on invading Romania following a new crisis in Romanian-Hungarian relations caused by complaints from Budapest that the Romanians were mistreating the Magyar minority in Transylvania (which were supported by Berlin), the king ordered general mobilization of his military while taking off in the royal yacht to Istanbul. During his unexpected trip to Istanbul, Carol held talks with the Turkish President İsmet İnönü and the Turkish Foreign Minister Şükrü Saracoğlu during which the Turks promised him that Turkey would immediately mobilize its military in the event of an Axis attack on Romania. The Turks, in their turn, pressed Carol to sign an alliance with the Soviet Union, something that Carol said very reluctantly he might do if the Turks were to serve as the middlemen and if the Soviets were to promise to recognize the border with Romania. The show of Romanian resolve, supported by Turkey had the effect of causing the Hungarians to back off on their demands against Romania.

The news of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact in August 1939 was received with horror by Carol, who had sought to play off both sides against each other. Carol allowed Călinescu to tell Thierry that the Romanians would destroy their oil fields if the Axis invaded, while at the same time Gafencu told the German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop of his firm friendship with Germany, his opposition to the &quot;peace front,&quot; and his desire to sell more oil to the Germans. After the signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, Călinescu advised Carol: &quot;Germany is the real danger. An alliance with it is tantamount to a protectorate. Only Germany&#x27;s defeat by France and Britain can ward off the danger.&quot;. On 27 August 1939, Gafencu told Fabricius that Romania would declare neutrality if Germany invaded Poland and that he wanted to sell to Germany some 450,000 tons of oil per month in exchange for 1 million and a half &quot;Reichsmark&quot; plus a number of modern German aircraft for free. Carol met with the German air force attaché on 28 August 1939, to congratulate the Germans on the great diplomatic success they had gained with the pact with the Soviet Union. Unknown to Carol, the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact had in its infamous &quot;secret protocols&quot; assigned the Romanian region of Bessarabia to the Soviet Union. In the short run, the German–Soviet pact was a blessing for Carol since Germany now had access to Soviet oil, which reduced the pressure on Romania.

==World War II==
When World War II began with German-Soviet Invasion of Poland in September 1939, Carol proclaimed neutrality. In doing so, Carol technically violated the letter of the treaty of alliance with Poland signed in 1921 and the spirit of treaty of alliance signed with France in 1926. Carol justified his policy under the grounds that, with Germany and the Soviet Union allied in the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact of August 1939 and France holding its forces behind the Maginot line, unwilling to start an offensive into Germany, that neutrality was his only hope of preserving his kingdom&#x27;s independence. For its part, the Polish government was more interested in weapon deliveries from its Western allies through Romanian ports, but this became insignificant following Poland&#x27;s defeat on the battlefield. As usual with Carol, he sought to play a careful balancing act between the Allies and the Axis, on one hand signing a new economic treaty with Germany while on the other hand allowing for a considerable period of time for the Polish troops to cross into Romania while declining to intern them as international law required. Instead, the Poles were allowed to travel to Constanța to board ships to take them to Marseille to continue the fight against Germany from France. The Romanian Bridgehead remained a key escape route for thousands of Poles in the desperate days of September 1939. It was only after receiving a number of furious complaints from Fabricius about the passage of Polish soldiers across Romania that Carol finally started to intern the fleeing Poles.

On 21 September 1939, Prime Minister Călinescu was assassinated by the Iron Guard in a plot organized out of Berlin, thus silencing the strongest pro-Allied voice amongst Carol&#x27;s &quot;camarilla&quot;. The next day, the nine assassins of Călinescu were publicity shot without the benefit of a trial and on the week of 22–28 September 1939, 242 members of the Iron Guard were the victims of extrajudicial executions. Because of its oil, Romania was highly important by both sides, and during the Phoney War of 1939–40 there occurred what Weinberg called a &quot;silent struggle over Romania&#x27;s oil,&quot; with the German government doing everything within its power to have as much Romanian oil as possible while the British and French governments equally doing everything possible to deny it. The British launched an unsuccessful campaign to sabotage Romanian oil fields and the transportation network that took Romanian oil to Germany. In January 1940, Carol broadcast a speech to proclaim that it was his brilliant handling of foreign policy that kept Romania neutral and safe from danger. He also announced that he was going to be building a gigantic defense line around the kingdom, and as such, taxes would have to rise to pay for it. Romanians called the proposed line the Imaginet Line, as the line was considered to be a purely imaginary version of the Maginot line and many of Carol&#x27;s subjects suspected that the money raised by higher taxes would go to the king&#x27;s Swiss bank accounts.

Carol had hedged his bets about whether to choose between the Allies and the Axis. It was only in late May 1940, when France was clearly losing the war that Carol swung decisively over to the Axis side. During the later period of the Phoney War, after waging a campaign of bloody repression against the Iron Guard, which reached its peak after Călinescu&#x27;s assassination, Carol began a policy of reaching out to the surviving Iron Guard leaders. Carol felt that a &quot;tamed&quot; Iron Guard could be used as a source of popular support. In April 1940, Carol had reached an agreement with Vasile Noveanu, the leader of the underground Iron Guard in Romania, but it was not until early May 1940 that Horia Sima, the leader of the Iron Guards in exile in Germany, could be persuaded to support the government. On 26 May 1940, Sima returned to Romania from Germany to begin talks with General Mihail Moruzov of the secret service about the Iron Guard joining the government. On 28 May 1940, after learning of the surrender of Belgium, Carol told the Crown Council that Germany was going to win the war, and Romania accordingly needed to realign its foreign and domestic policies with the victors. On 13 June 1940, an agreement was reached whereas the Iron Guard would be allowed to join the National Renaissance Front in exchange for more and harsher anti-Semitic laws. The National Renaissance Front was reorganized as the Party of the Nation, which was described as &quot;a single and totalitarian party under the supreme leadership of His Majesty, King Carol II.&quot; On 21 June 1940, France signed an armistice with Germany. Romania&#x27;s elite had been so obsessively Francophile for so long that France&#x27;s defeat had the effect of discrediting that elite in the eyes of public opinion and led to an upswing of popular support for the pro-German Iron Guard.

In the midst of the turn towards the Iron Guard and Germany came a bombshell from abroad. On 26 June 1940, the Soviet Union submitted an ultimatum demanding that Romania hand over the Bessarabia region (which had been Russian until 1918) and the northern part of Bukovina (which had never been Russian) to the Soviet Union and threatened war within the next two days if the ultimatum was rejected. Carol had at one moment considered following the example of Finland in 1939 when faced with a similar Soviet ultimatum, but the outcome of the Winter War was scarcely an inspiring example. Carol at first considered rejecting the ultimatum, but upon being informed that the Romanian Army would be no match for the Red Army, agreed to cede Bessarabia and northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union. Carol appealed to Berlin for support against the Soviet ultimatum, only to be told to comply with Stalin&#x27;s demands. The loss of the regions without any fighting to the Soviet Union was felt to be a national humiliation by the Romanian people and was a huge blow to Carol&#x27;s prestige. Carol&#x27;s personality cult had by 1940 reached such extreme heights that the withdrawal without any resistance from Bessarabia and northern Bukovina revealed that Carol was a mere man after all, and so badly dented his prestige more than would have been the case if Carol had maintained a more modest image.

On 28 June 1940, Sima entered the cabinet as Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry of Education. On 1 July 1940, Carol, in a radio speech, renounced both the 1926 alliance with France and the 1939 Anglo-French &quot;guarantee&quot; of Romania, saying that henceforth Romania would seek its place in the German-dominated &quot;New Order&quot; in Europe. The next day, Carol invited a German military mission to train the Romanian Army. On 4 July 1940, Carol was sworn into a new government headed by Ion Gigurtu with Sima as Minister of Arts and Culture. Gigurtu had been a leading figure in the anti-Semitic National Christian Party in the 1930s, was a millionaire businessman with many connections to Germany, and was a well-known Germanophile. For all these reasons, Carol hoped that having Gigurtu as prime minister would win him Hitler&#x27;s goodwill and thus prevent any further loss of territory. Along the same lines, Carol signed a new economic treaty with Germany on 8 August 1940, that finally gave the Germans the economic dominance of Romania and its oil that they had been seeking all through the 1930s.

Immediately afterwards, inspired by the Soviet example of gaining Romanian territory, the Bulgarians demanded the return of Dobruja, lost in the Second Balkan War of 1913, while the Hungarians demanded the return of Transylvania, lost to Romania after World War I. Romania and Bulgaria opened talks that led to the Treaty of Craiova, which saw the southern Dobruja ceded to Bulgaria. In particular, Carol proved unwilling to cede Transylvania, and had it not been for the diplomatic intervention of Germany and Italy, Romania and Hungary would have gone to war with each other in the summer of 1940. In the meantime, Carol imprisoned General Ion Antonescu after the latter had criticized the king, charging that it was the corruption of the royal government that was responsible for the military backwardness of Romania and hence the loss of Bessarabia. Both Fabricius and Hermann Neubacher, the man in charge of the Four Year Plan&#x27;s operations in the Balkans, intervened with Carol, saying that Antonescu&#x27;s &quot;accidental death&quot; or being &quot;shot while trying to escape&quot; would &quot;make a very bad impression on the German headquarters,&quot; as Antonescu was known to be a leading advocate of an alliance with Germany. On 11 July 1940, Carol had Antonescu freed, but kept under house arrest at the Bistrița monastery.

Hitler was alarmed about the possibility of a Hungarian-Romanian war, which he feared might result in the destruction of Romania&#x27;s oil fields and/or might lead to the Soviets intervening to seize all of Romania. At this time, Hitler was already seriously considering invading the Soviet Union in 1941, and if he were to take such a step, he would need Romanian oil to power his military. At the Second Vienna Award of 30 August 1940, the German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and the Italian Foreign Minister Count Galeazzo Ciano ruled that northern Transylvania was to go to Hungary while southern Transylvania would stay with Romania, a compromise that left both Budapest and Bucharest deeply unhappy with the Vienna award. For economic reasons, Romania was far more important to Hitler than was Hungary, but Romania had been allied to France since 1926 and had flirted with joining the British-inspired &quot;peace front&quot; in 1939, so Hitler who personally disliked and mistrusted Carol – felt that Romania deserved to be punished for waiting so long to align with the Axis. After the fall of Paris in June 1940, the Germans had captured the archives of the Quai d&#x27;Orsay and were thus well-informed about the double-line that Carol had pursued until the spring of 1940. Hitler was annoyed with Carol&#x27;s efforts to forge closer ties with France at the same time proclaiming his friendship towards Germany. At the same time, Hitler offered Carol a &quot;guarantee&quot; of the rest of Romania against further territorial losses, which Carol promptly accepted.

==Road to abdication==
The acceptance of the Second Vienna Award completely discredited Carol with his people, and in early September 1940 enormous demonstrations broke out all over Romania demanding that Carol abdicate. On 1 September 1940, Sima who had resigned from the government gave a speech calling upon Carol to abdicate, and the Iron Guard began to organize demonstrations all over Romania to press for king&#x27;s abdication. On 2 September 1940, Valer Pop, a courtier and an important member of the &quot;camarilla&quot; first advised Carol to appoint General Ion Antonescu as prime minister as the solution to the crisis. Pop&#x27;s reasons for advising Carol to have Antonescu as prime minister was partly because Antonescu – who was known to be friendly with the Iron Guard and had been imprisoned under Carol – was believed to have enough of an oppositional background to appease the public and partly because Pop knew that Antonescu for all his Legionary sympathies was a member of the elite and would never turn against it. As the increasingly large crowds started to assemble outside of the royal palace demanding the king&#x27;s abdication, Carol considered Pop&#x27;s advice, but was reluctant to have Antonescu as prime minister. As more and more people started to join the protests, Pop feared that Romania was on the verge of a revolution that might not only sweep away the king&#x27;s regime, but also the elite who had dominated the country since the 19th century. To apply further pressure on Carol, Pop met with Fabricius on the night of 4 September 1940 to ask him to tell Carol that the &quot;Reich&quot; wanted Antonescu as prime minister, which led to Fabricius promptly calling Carol to tell him to appoint the general as the prime minister. Additionally, the very ambitious General Antonescu who long coveted the premiership now suddenly started to downplay his long-standing antipathy to Carol, and he suggested that he was prepared to forgive past slights and disputes.

On 5 September 1940, Antonescu became prime minister, and Carol transferred most of his dictatorial powers to him. As prime minister, Antonescu was a man acceptable to both the Iron Guard and the traditional elite. Carol planned to stay as king after appointing Antonescu and initially Antonescu did not support the popular demand for Carol&#x27;s abdication. Antonescu had become prime minister, but he had a weak political base. As an Army officer, Antonescu was a loner, an arrogant and aloft man with an extremely bad temper who as a consequence was very unpopular with his fellow officers. Antonescu&#x27;s relations with the politicians were no better, and as such Antonescu was initially unwilling to move against the king until he had some political allies. Carol ordered Antonescu and General Dumitru Coroamă who commanded the troops in Bucharest to shoot down demonstrators in front of the royal palace, an order that both refused to obey. It was only on 6 September 1940, when Antonescu learned of a plot to murder him headed by another member of the &quot;camarilla&quot; General Paul Teodorescu that Antonescu joined the chorus demanding Carol&#x27;s abdication. With public opinion solidly against him and with the Army refusing to obey his orders, Carol was forced to abdicate.

Concerning the claim of the American historian Larry Watts that it was Carol that allied Romania to Nazi Germany and that Marshal Ion Antonescu had unwillingly inherited an alliance with Germany in 1940, the Canadian historian Dov Lungu wrote:

[Watts&#x27;s] claim that Romania&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; alliance with Germany under Antonescu was the work of Carol, who began laying its foundations for it as early as 1938, is wide off the mark. Carol&#x27;s concessions to Germany were made half–heartedly and delayed as much as possible in the hope that the western powers would regain the initiative on the political-diplomatic front and, from September 1939, the military one. He finally did change his country&#x27;s external economic and political orientation, but only in the spring of 1940, when German hegemony on the Continent seemed imminent. In addition, there is more than a subtle distinction between Carol&#x27;s request in the last weeks of his rule for the dispatch of a German military mission to train the ill–prepared Romanian Army and Antonescu&#x27;s decision almost immediately after assuming power to fight on Germany&#x27;s side until the very end. In fact, in his desire to regain the province of Bessarabia, Antonescu was keener than the Germans&#x27; in Romania&#x27;s participation in an anti-Soviet war.

==Exile==
Forced under Soviet and subsequently Hungarian, Bulgarian, and German pressure to surrender parts of his kingdom to foreign rule, he was finally outmaneuvered by the pro-German administration of Marshal Ion Antonescu, and abdicated in favour of Michael in September 1940. He went into exile, first in Mexico, then in Portugal. While in Portugal, he stayed in Estoril, at Casa do Mar e Sol. Carol and Lupescu finally settled in Mexico City, where he purchased a house in one of Mexico City&#x27;s most expensive districts. During World War II, Carol tried to set up a Free Romania movement based in Mexico to overthrow General Antonescu. Carol had hopes that his Free Romania movement would be recognized as a government-in-exile and would ultimately lead to him being restored. The closest Carol ever got to having his Free Romania movement recognized came in 1942 when President Manuel Ávila Camacho allowed Carol to stand beside him while reviewing his troops. Carol would have liked to operate out of the United States, but the American government refused him permission to enter. However, Carol was in contact with two Eastern Orthodox priests living in Chicago, Father Glicherie Moraru and Father Alexandru Opreanu, who organized an unsuccessful campaign in the Romanian-American community to pressure the American government to recognize the &quot;Free Romania&quot; committee as the legitimate government of Romania.

To advance his cause, Carol published a magazine in America called &quot;The Free Romanian&quot; and published several books in both Romanian and English. A major problem for Carol&#x27;s efforts to mobilize the Romanian American community was the Immigration Control Act of 1924, which drastically limited immigration from Eastern Europe into the United States. As such, the majority of Romanian Americans in the 1940s were either persons who immigrated prior to 1924 or their children; in either case, Carol did not mean much to them. Furthermore, many Romanian Americans were Jews who had neither forgiven nor forgotten that it was Carol who had appointed the anti-Semitic fanatic Goga as prime minister in 1937. To improve his image amongst Jews, Carol persuaded Leon Fischer, the former vice-president of the United Romanian Jews of America, to write articles on his behalf in American Jewish magazines that portrayed the former king as the friend and protector of the Jews and an enemy of anti-Semitism. The reaction to Fischer&#x27;s articles was overwhelmingly negative with a flood of letters to the editor who complained bitterly that it was Carol who signed in all of Goga&#x27;s laws that took away Romanian citizenship from Jews and made it illegal for Romanian Jews to own land and shares in public companies and work as lawyers, doctors, teachers, etc. Furthermore, the writers of the letters noted that Carol allowed these laws to remain on the statute books after dismissing Goga and sarcastically commented that if Carol was the best friend of the Jews in Romania, then Romanian Jews certainly did not need enemies.

Carol&#x27;s offers to have his Free Romania committee recognized as a government-in-exile was hindered by his unpopularity in his own homeland with many British and American diplomats arguing that supporting the former king was likely to increase public support for General Antonescu. Beyond that, there was a rival Free Romania committee headed by Viorel Tilea based in London that wanted to have nothing to do with Carol&#x27;s committee in Mexico City. Virgil Tilea had as a university student in the 1930s supported the Iron Guard. Unusually for a Romanian in this period, Tilea was an Anglophile rather a Francophile, and had attended Cambridge University as an exchange student. Tilea&#x27;s time in Britain changed his political views as he later stated that seeing many different types of people living in harmony in Britain made him realize that it was not necessary for one ethnic group to dominate all the others as Codreanu had proclaimed, leading him to break with Iron Guard. When General Antonescu was sworn in as prime minister as the new &quot;National Legionary State&quot;, Tilea resigned as Romanian minister in London in protest at the appointment. Later in 1940, Tilea formed his Free Romania committee in London that attracted support from a number of Romanians who fled the Antonescu regime into exile.

Tilea&#x27;s Free Committee was not officially recognized by the British government, but was known to have the support of Britain and to be very close to the Polish government-in-exile, which was a major reason why the British spurned the Carol&#x27;s rival Free Romania committee based in Mexico City, which tended to attract support only from those Romanians who been closely associated with the king&#x27;s &quot;camarilla&quot;. Tilea&#x27;s committee had an office in Istanbul which regularly sent couriers to a safe house in Bucharest, where messages were exchanged with one of Carol&#x27;s former prime ministers Constantin Argetoianu who in turn acted as an emissary for those opposed to Antonescu. Argetoianu reported that King Michael was opposed to the Antonescu regime and wanted to stage a coup d&#x27;état to depose Antonescu, waiting only for the Allies to invade the Balkans. General Antonescu was the dictator, but Romanian army officers took their oath of loyalty to the king, so there was reason to believe in London that the Romanian Army would side with the king against the prime minister if the two came into conflict. From the British viewpoint, associating themselves with Carol&#x27;s campaign to once again depose his own son would only complicate their dealings with King Michael.
Carol and Magda Lupescu were married in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on 3 June 1947, Magda calling herself Princess Elena von Hohenzollern. In 1947 after the Communist take-over of Romania, a Romanian National Committee was set up to oppose the Communist regime. Carol&#x27;s efforts to join the Romanian National Committee were rebuffed as all the factions were opposed to him, and Romanian monarchists on the committee made it clear that they regarded King Michael, not his father as the legitimate king of Romania. Carol remained in exile for the rest of his life. He was never to see his son, King Michael, after his 1940 departure from Romania. Michael could see no point in meeting his father who had humiliated his mother so many times via his open affairs and did not attend his funeral.

==Remains returned to Romania==
Carol died in Estoril, on the Portuguese Riviera in 1953. His coffin was placed inside the Pantheon of the House of Braganza in Lisbon. His remains were finally returned to the Curtea de Argeș monastery in Romania in 2003, the traditional burial ground of Romanian royalty, at the request and expense of the government of Romania (led by Adrian Năstase). They initially lay outside the cathedral, the burial place of Romanian kings and queens, as Elena was not of royal blood. Neither of his sons participated in either ceremony. King Michael I was represented by his daughter, Crown Princess Margareta, her husband, Prince Radu and two grandchildren Nicolae de Roumanie-Medforth-Mills and Karina de Roumanie Medforth-Mills.

In January 2018, it was announced that the remains of King Carol II would be moved to the new Archdiocesan and Royal Cathedral, along with those of Princess Helen. In addition, the remains of Prince Mircea would also be moved to the new cathedral. His remains were at the time interred at the Bran Castle&#x27;s Chapel. King Carol II of Romania was reburied at the New Episcopal and Royal Cathedral in Curtea de Argeș on 8 March 2019.

Carol Lambrino was forbidden (since 1940) from entering Romanian territory, but a Romanian court declared him a legitimate son in 2003. Carol visited Bucharest in November 2005, shortly before his death.

==Archives==

Young Prince Carol&#x27;s letters to his grandfather, Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, are preserved in the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen family archive, which is in the State Archive of Sigmaringen (Staatsarchiv Sigmaringen) in the town of Sigmaringen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. There are also letters from young Carol (together with letters from his mother, Crown Princess Marie) to his great-grandmother, Josephine of Baden, preserved in the State Archive of Sigmaringen (Staatsarchiv Sigmaringen).

Carol II of Romania&#x27;s letters to Zizi Lambrino as well as documents about their marriage are preserved in the &quot;Jeanne Marie Valentine Lambrino Papers&quot; collection in the Hoover Institution Archives (Stanford, California, US).

==In popular culture==
Carol appears as a character [as Prince Carol] in the final episode of the third season of &quot;Mr. Selfridge&quot;, where he is played in a cameo appearance by British actor Anton Blake.

Carol is also considered to be the inspiration for the character Prince Charles of Carpathia in the 1953 play &quot;The Sleeping Prince&quot; and the 1957 related film &quot;The Prince and the Showgirl&quot;. &quot;Ex-King Carol Weds Lupescu&quot; was front-page news next to an article announcing a downed flying saucer in Roswell, New Mexico.

He makes an appearance in the 2019 film &quot;&quot; as an antagonist along with his mistress.
