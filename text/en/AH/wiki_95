<text>The Reformation, also known as the Protestant Reformation and the European Reformation, was a major theological movement in Western Christianity in 16th-century Europe that posed a religious and political challenge to the papacy and the authority of the Catholic Church. Following the start of the Renaissance, the Reformation marked the beginning of Protestantism. It is considered one of the events that signified the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of the early modern period in Europe. The end of the Reformation era is disputed among modern scholars.

Prior to Martin Luther and other Protestant Reformers, there were earlier reform movements within Western Christianity. The Reformation, however, is usually considered to have started with the publication of the &quot;Ninety-five Theses&quot;, authored by Martin Luther in 1517. Four years later, in January 1521, Luther was excommunicated by Pope Leo X. In May 1521, at the Diet of Worms, Luther was condemned by the Holy Roman Empire, which officially banned citizens from defending or propagating Luther&#x27;s ideas. Luther survived after being declared an outlaw due to the protection of Elector Frederick the Wise.

In general, the Reformers argued that salvation in Christianity was a completed status based on faith in Jesus alone and not a process that could involve good works, as in the Catholic view. Protestantism also introduced new ecclesiology. The spread of Gutenberg&#x27;s printing press provided the means for the rapid dissemination of religious materials in the vernacular. The initial movement in Germany diversified, and nearby other reformers such as Huldrych Zwingli and John Calvin with different theologies arose.

The Counter-Reformation comprised the Catholic response to the Reformation, and largely affirmed Catholic positions that had been subject to critique by reformers.

==Terminology==
In the 16th-century context, the term mainly covers four major movements: Lutheranism, Calvinism, the Radical Reformation, and the Catholic Reformation and Counter-Reformation. Since the late , historians often use the plural of the term to emphasize that the Reformation was not a uniform and coherent historical phenomenon but the result of parallel movements. 

Anglican theologian Alister McGrath explains the term &quot;Reformation&quot; as &quot;an interpretative category—a way of mapping out a slice of history in which certain ideas, attitudes, and values were developed, explored, and applied&quot;. Historian John Bossy criticized the term Reformation for &quot;wrongly implying that bad religion was giving way to good,&quot; but also because it has &quot;little application to actual social behaviour and little or no sensitivity to thought, feeling or culture.&quot;

Specific terminology includes:
* &quot;Protestant Reformation&quot; excludes the Renaissance and early modern Catholic reform movements. 
* &quot;Magisterial Reformation&quot; has a narrower sense, as it refers only to mainstream Protestantism, primarily Lutheranism and Calvinism, contrasting it with more radical ideas such as the Anabaptists&#x27;.
* &quot;Catholic Reformation&quot; is distinguished by the historian Massimo Firpo from Counter-Reformation. In his view, Catholic Reformation was &quot;centered on the care of souls ..., episcopal residence, the renewal of the clergy, together with the charitable and educational roles of the new religious orders&quot;, whereas Counter-Reformation was &quot;founded upon the defence of orthodoxy, the repression of dissent, the reassertion of ecclesiastical authority&quot;. 
* Some historians have also suggested a persisting &quot;Erasmian Reformation.&quot;

Several aspects of the Reformation, such as changes in the arts, music, rituals, and communities are frequently presented in specialised studies.

The historian Peter Marshall emphasizes that the &quot;call for &#x27;reform&#x27; within Christianity is about as old as the religion itself, and in every age there have been urgent attempts to bring it about&quot;. Charlemagne employed a &quot;rhetoric of reform&quot;. Medieval examples include the Cluniac Reform in the , and the 11th-century Gregorian Reform, both striving against lay influence over church affairs. When demanding a church reform, medieval authors mainly adopted a conservative and utopian approach, expressing their admiration for a previous &quot;golden age&quot; or &quot;apostolic age&quot; when the Church had allegedly been perfect and free of abuses.

When considered as a historical time period, both the starting and ending date of the Reformation have always been debated. The most commonly used starting date is 31 October 1517—the day when the German theologian Martin Luther (d. 1546) allegedly nailed up a copy of his disputation paper on indulgences and papal power known as the &quot;Ninety-five Theses&quot; to the door of the castle church in Wittenberg in Electoral Saxony. Calvinist historians often propose that the Reformation started when the Swiss priest Huldrych Zwingli (d. 1531) first preached against abuses in the Church in 1516. The end date of the Reformation is even more disputed: considered as political/martial strife, 25 September 1555 (when the Peace of Augsburg was accepted), 23 May 1618 and 24 October 1648 (when the Thirty Years&#x27; War began and ended, respectively) are the most commonly mentioned terminuses. The Reformation has always been presented as one of the most crucial episodes of the early modern period, or even regarded as the event separating the modern era from the Middle Ages.

The term Protestant, though initially purely political in nature, later acquired a broader sense, referring to a member of any Western church that subscribed to the main Reformation (or anti-Catholic) principles. Six princes of the Holy Roman Empire and rulers of fourteen Imperial Free Cities, who issued a protest (or dissent) against the edict of the Diet of Speyer (1529), were the first individuals to be called Protestants. The edict reversed concessions made to the Lutherans with the approval of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V three years earlier.

==Background==

===Calamities===

Europe experienced a period of dreadful calamities from the early . These culminated in a devastating pandemic known as the Black Death, which killed about one-third of Europe&#x27;s population. Around 1500, the population of Europe was about people—no more than of the mid-14th-century demographic maximum. Due to a shortage of workforce, the landlords began to restrict the rights of their tenants which led to rural revolts that often ended with a compromise.
The constant fear of unexpected death was mirrored by popular artistic motifs, such as the allegory of (&#x27;dance of death&#x27;). The fear also contributed to the growing popularity of Masses for the dead. Already detectable among early Christians, these ceremonies indicated a widespread belief in purgatory—a transitory state for souls that needed purification before entering heaven. Fear of malevolent magical practice was also growing, and witch hunts intensified.

At the end of the , the sexually transmitted infection known as syphilis spread throughout Europe for the first time. Syphilis destroyed its victims&#x27; looks with ulcers and scabs before killing them. Along with the French invasion of Italy, syphilis contributed to the success of the charismatic preacher Girolamo Savonarola (d. 1498) who called for a moral renewal in Florence. He was arrested and executed for heresy, but his meditations remained a popular reading.

===Late Medieval Christianity===
====Lay community====
Historian John Bossy (as summarized by Eamon Duffy) emphasized that &quot;medieval Christianity had been fundamentally concerned with the creation and maintenance of peace in a violent world. &#x27;Christianity&#x27; in medieval Europe denoted neither an ideology nor an institution, but a community of believers whose religious ideal—constantly aspired to if seldom attained—was peace and mutual love.&quot; 

The Catholic Church taught that entry into heaven required dying in a . Based on Christ&#x27;s parable on the Last Judgement, the Church considered the performance of good works by the faithful, such as feeding the hungry and visiting the sick, as an important co-condition of salvation. 

Villagers and urban laypeople were frequently members of confraternities (such as the Archconfraternity of the Gonfalone), mutual-support guilds associated with a saint, or religious fraternities (such as the Third Order of Saint Francis). The faithful made pilgrimages to saints&#x27; shrines, but the proliferation in the saints&#x27; number undermined their reputation. There was a strong non-theological Biblical awareness, especially of the Gospels and Psalms.

New religious movements promoted the deeper involvement of laity in religious practices. The Brethren of the Common Life dissuaded their members&#x27; priestly ordination and often placed their houses under the protection of urban authorities. They were closely associated with the , a new method of Catholic spirituality with a special emphasis on the education of laypeople. A leader of the movement the Dutch Wessel Gansfort (d. 1489) attacked abuses of indulgences.

Church buildings were richly decorated with paintings, sculptures, and stained glass windows. While Romanesque and Gothic art made a clear distinction between the supernatural and the human, Renaissance artists depicted God and the saints in a more human way. Historian Caroline Walker Bynum has written of ‘a sort of religious materialism&#x27; in the period: &#x27;a frenzied conviction that the divine tended to erupt into matter’.

====Sources of authority====

The sources of religious authority included the Bible and its authoritative commentaries, apostolic tradition, decisions by ecumenical councils, scholastic theology, and papal authority. Catholics regarded the Vulgate as the Bible&#x27;s authentic Latin translation. Commentators applied several methods of interpretations to resolve contradictions within the Bible. Apostolic tradition verified religious practices with unclear Biblical foundations or which required deduction, such as infant baptism. The ecumenical councils&#x27; decisions were binding to all Catholics. The crucial elements of mainstream Christianity had been first summarised in the Nicene Creed in 325. Its western text contained a unilateral addition which contributed to the schism between Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. The Creed contained the dogma of Trinity about one God uniting three equal persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Church authorities acknowledged that an individual might exceptionally receive direct revelations from God but maintained that a genuine revelation could not challenge traditional religious principles. Preaching was an important part of bishops&#x27; and priests&#x27; responsibilities.

====Clergy====

Western Christianity displayed a remarkable unity. This was the outcome of the Gregorian Reform that established papal supremacy over the Catholic Church, and achieved the legal separation of the Catholic clergy from laity. Clerical celibacy was reinforced through the prohibition of clerical marriage; ecclesiastical courts were granted exclusive jurisdiction over clerics, and also over matrimonial causes. Priests were ordained by bishops in accordance with the principle of apostolic succession—a claim to the uninterrupted transmission of their consecrating power from Christ&#x27;s Apostles through generations of bishops. Bishops, abbots, abbesses, and other prelates might possess remarkable wealth. Some of the ecclesiastic leaders also functioned as local secular princes, such as the prince-bishops in Kingdom of Germany and the English County Palatine of Durham, and the Grand Masters of the Teutonic Knights in their Baltic . Other prelates might be regents or the power behind the throne. Believers were expected to pay the tithe (one tenth of their income) to the Church. Pluralism—the practice of holding multiple Church offices (or benefices)—was not unusual. This led to non-residence, and the absent priests&#x27; deputies were often poorly educated and underpaid.

The clergy consisted of two major groups, the regular clergy and the secular clergy. Regular clerics lived under a monastic rule within the framework of a religious order; secular clerics were responsible for pastoral care. The Church was a hierarchical organisation. The pope was elected by high-ranking clergymen, the cardinals, and assisted by the professional staff of the Roman Curia. Secular clerics were organised into territorial units known as dioceses, each ruled by a bishop or archbishop. Each diocese was divided into parishes headed by parish priests who administered most sacraments to the faithful. These were sacred rites thought to transfer divine grace to humankind. The Council of Florence declared baptism, confirmation, marriage, extreme unction, penance, the Eucharist, and priestly ordination as the seven sacraments of the Catholic Church. Women were not ordained priests but could live as nuns in convents after taking the three monastic vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience.

====Papacy====

The authority of the papacy was based on a well-organised system of communication and bureaucracy. The popes claimed the power of binding and loosing that Christ had reportedly granted to Peter the Apostle (d. 66), and offered indulgence—the reduction of the penance in both this world and the purgatory—to sinners from an allegedly inexhaustible treasury of merit. The popes also granted dispensations to institutions or individuals, exempting them from certain provisions of canon law (or ecclesiastic law). 

From 1309 to 1417, the papacy was in turmoil: first a Pope was arrested by French troops and the papal court moved to Avignon, then various election controversies resulted in the Western Schism (1378-1417) leading to, at the end, three rival claimant Popes. At the Council of Constance, one of the three popes resigned, his two rivals were deposed, and the newly elected Martin V () was acknowledged as the legitimate pope throughout Catholic Europe.

The Council of Constance declared that the popes owed obedience to the ecumenical councils. This idea known as conciliarism was condemned by Pope Pius II () in a papal bull, but ecclesiastic and secular leaders often referred to it during their conflicts with the papacy. Relationships between the papacy and powerful Catholic rulers were regulated in special agreements known as concordats, limiting papal authority.

As princes of the Papal States in Italy, the popes were deeply involved in the power struggles of the peninsula. In this respect, the Renaissance popes were not dissimilar to secular rulers. Pope Alexander VI () appointed his relatives, among them his own illegitimate sons to high offices. Pope Julius II () took up arms to recover papal territories lost during his predecessors&#x27; reign. In the Age of Exploration, claimed the right to distribute the newly discovered lands between Spain and Portugal, and his decision was confirmed in the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494. The Spanish and Portuguese conquests and developing trade networks contributed to the global expansion of Catholicism. 

The popes were generous patrons of art and architecture. ordered the demolition of the ruined 4th-century St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in preparation for the building of a new Renaissance basilica.

====Partial and failed institutional reforms====

The necessity of a church reform (&#x27;in head and limbs&#x27;) was frequently discussed at the ecumenical councils from the late . However, most stakeholders—popes, prelates and kings—preferred the because they did not want to lose privileges or revenues. The system of papal dispensations was a principal obstacle to the implementation of reform measures, as the Holy See regularly granted immunities to those who did not want to execute them.

Within regular clergy, the so-called &quot;congregations of strict observance&quot; spread. These were monastic communities that returned to the strict interpretation of their order&#x27;s rule. Reformist bishops tried to discipline their clergy through regular canonical visitations but their attempts mainly failed due to the resistance of autonomous institutions such as cathedral chapters. Neither could they exercise authority over non-resident clerics who had received their benefice from the papacy. On the eve of the Reformation, the Fifth Council of the Lateran was the last occasion when efforts to introduce a far-reaching reform from above could have achieved but it was dissolved in 1517 without making decisions on the issues that would soon come to the fore.

===Humanism===

A new intellectual movement known as Humanism emerged in the Late Middle Ages. The Humanists&#x27; slogan (&#x27;back to the sources!&#x27;) demonstrated their enthusiasm for Classical texts and textual criticism. The rise of the Ottoman Empire led to the mass immigration of Byzantine scholars to Western Europe, and many of them brought manuscripts previously unknown to western scholarship. This led to the rediscovery of the Ancient Greek philosopher Plato (). Plato&#x27;s ideas about an ultimate reality lying beyond visible reality posed a serious challenge to scholastic theologians&#x27; rigorous definitions. Textual criticism called into question the reliability of some of the fundamental texts of papal privilege: humanist scholars, like Nicholas of Cusa (d. 1464) proved that one of the basic documents of papal authority, the allegedly 4th-century &quot;Donation of Constantine&quot; was a medieval forgery.

As the manufacturing of paper from rags and the printing machine with movable type were spreading in Europe, books could be bought at a reasonable price from the . Demand for religious literature was especially high. The German inventor Johannes Gutenberg (d. 1468) first published a two-volume printed version of the Vulgata in the early 1450s. High and Low German, Italian, Dutch, Spanish, Czech and Catalan translations of the Bible were published between 1466 and 1492; in France, the Bible&#x27;s abridged French versions gained popularity. Laypeople who read the Bible could challenge their priests&#x27; sermons, as it happened already in 1515.

Completed by Jerome (d. 420), the Vulgate contained the Septuagint version of the Old Testament. The systematic study of Biblical manuscripts revealed that Jerome had sometimes misinterpreted his sources of translation. A series of Latin-Greek editions of the New Testament was completed by the Dutch humanist Erasmus (d. 1536). These new Latin translations challenged some scriptural proof texts for some Catholic dogmas.

===Dissidents===



After Arianism—a Christological doctrine condemned as heresy at ecumenical councils—disappeared in the late , no major disputes menaced the theological unity of the Western Church. Religious enthusiasts could organise their followers into nonconformist groups but they disbanded after their founder died. The Waldensians were a notable exception. Due to their efficient organisation, they survived not only the death of their founder Peter Waldo (d. 1205), but also a series of anti-heretic crusades. They rejected the clerics&#x27; monopoly of public ministry, and allowed all trained members of their community, men and women alike, to preach.

The Western Schism reinforced a general desire for church reform. The Oxford theologian John Wycliffe (d. 1384) was one of the most radical critics. He attacked pilgrimages, the veneration of saints, and the doctrine of transubstantiation. He regarded the Church as an exclusive community of those chosen by God to salvation, and argued that the state could seize the corrupt clerics&#x27; endowments. Known as Lollards, Wycliffe&#x27;s followers rejected images, clerical celibacy and the purchase of indulgences by crusading lords. The Parliament of England passed a law against heretics, but Lollard communities survived the purges.

Wycliffe&#x27;s theology had a marked impact on the Prague academic Jan Hus (d. 1415). He delivered popular sermons against the clerics&#x27; wealth and temporal powers, for which he was summoned to the Council of Constance. Although the German king Sigismund of Luxemburg () had granted him safe conduct, Hus was sentenced to death for heresy and burned at the stake on 6 July 1415. His execution led to a nationwide religious movement in Bohemia, and the papacy called for a series of crusades against Hus&#x27;s followers. The moderate Hussites, mainly Czech aristocrats and academics, were known as Utraquists for they taught that the Eucharist was to be administered (&#x27;in both kinds&#x27;) to the laity. The most radical Hussites, called Taborites after their new town of Tábor, held their property in common. Their millenarianism shocked the Utraquists who destroyed them in the Battle of Lipany in 1434. By this time, the remaining Catholic communities in Bohemia were almost exclusively German-speaking. The lack of a Hussite church hierarchy enabled the Czech aristocrats and urban magistrates to assume control of the Hussite clergy from the 1470s. The radical Hussites set up their own Church known as the Union of Bohemian Brethren. They rejected the separation of clergy and laity, and condemned all forms of violence and oath taking.

Marshall writes that the Lollards, Hussites and conciliarist theologians &quot;collectively give the lie to any suggestion that torpor and complacency were the hallmarks of religious life in the century before Martin Luther.&quot; Historians customarily refer to Wycliffe and Hus as &quot;Forerunners of the Reformation&quot;. The two reformers&#x27; emphasis on the Bible is often regarded as an early example of one of the basic principles of the Reformation—the idea (&#x27;by the Scriptures alone&#x27;), although prominent scholastic theologians were also convinced that Scripture, interpreted reasonably and in accord with the Church and the Fathers, contained all knowledge necessary for salvation.

==Beginnings==
The Reformation in Germanic countries was instigated by Martin Luther, however historians note that many of his ideas were pre-dated by Wycliff, Huss, Erasmus, Zwingli and others, both heretic and orthodox. Historian Peter Marshall has noted &quot;In recent decades, scholars have become increasingly acclimatized to the idea that the Reformation was in important respects a continuation and intensification of trends within later medieval Catholicism, rather than simply a wholesale rejection of it.&quot;

=== Luther and the &quot;Ninety-five Theses&quot; ===

Pope Leo X () decided to complete the construction of the new St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome. As the sale of certificates of indulgences had been a well-established method of papal fund raising, he announced new indulgences in the papal bull in 1515. On the advice of the banker Jakob Fugger (d. 1525), he appointed the pluralist prelate Albert of Brandenburg (d. 1545) to supervise the sale campaign in Germany. The Dominican friar Johann Tetzel (d. 1519), a leading figure in the campaign, applied unusually aggressive marketing methods. A slogan attributed to him famously claimed that &quot;As soon as the coin into the box rings, a soul from purgatory to heaven springs&quot;. Frederick the Wise, Prince-elector of Saxony () forbade the campaign because the suspended the sale of previous indulgences, depriving him of revenues that he had spent on his collection of relics.

The campaign&#x27;s vulgarity shocked many serious-minded believers, among them Martin Luther, a theology professor at the University of Wittenberg in Saxony. Born into a middle-class family, Luther entered an Augustinian monastery after a heavy thunderstorm dreadfully reminded him the risk of sudden death and eternal damnation, but his anxiety about his sinfulness did not abate. His studies on the works of the Late Roman theologian Augustine of Hippo (d. 430) convinced him that those whom God chose as his elect received a gift of faith independently of their acts. He first denounced the idea of justification through human efforts in his (&#x27;Disputation against Scholastic Theology&#x27;) in September 1517.

On 31 October 1517, Luther addressed a letter to Albert of Brandenburg, stating that the clerics preaching the St. Peter&#x27;s indulgences were deceiving the faithful, and attached his &quot;Ninety-five Theses&quot; to it. He questioned the efficacy of indulgences for the dead, although also stated &quot; indulgences were preached according to the spirit and intention of the pope, doubts would be readily resolved&quot;. Archbishop Albert ordered the theologians at the University of Mainz to examine the document. Tetzel, and the theologians Konrad Wimpina (d. 1531) and Johann Eck (d. 1543) were the first to associate some of Luther&#x27;s propositions with Hussitism. The case was soon forwarded to the Roman Curia for judgement. Pope Leo remained uninterested, and mentioned the case as &quot;a quarrel among friars&quot;.

=== New theology ===

As the historian Lyndal Roper notes, the &quot;Reformation proceeded by a set of debates and arguments&quot;. Luther presented his views in public at the observant Augustinians&#x27; assembly in Heidelberg on 26 April 1518. Here he explained his &quot;theology of the Cross&quot; about a loving God who had become frail to save fallen humanity, contrasting it with what he saw as the scholastic &quot;theology of glory&quot; that in his view celebrated erudition and human acts. It is uncertain when Luther&#x27;s concept of justification by faith alone—a central element of his theology—crystallised. He would later attribute it to his &quot;tower experience&quot; (1519), when he comprehended that God could freely declare even sinners righteous while he was thinking about the words of Paul the Apostle (d. 64 or 65)—&quot;the just shall live by faith&quot;.

Urged by Luther&#x27;s opponents, Pope Leo appointed the jurist Girolamo Ghinucci (d. 1541) and the theologian Sylvester Mazzolini (d. 1527) to inspect Luther&#x27;s teaching. Mazzolini argued that Luther had questioned papal authority by attacking the indulgences, while Luther concluded that only a fundamental reform could put an end to the abuse of indulgences. Pope Leo did not excommunicate Luther because Leo did not want to alienate Luther&#x27;s patron Frederick the Wise. Instead, he appointed Cardinal Thomas Cajetan (d. 1534) to convince Luther to withdraw some of his theses. Cajetan met with Luther at Augsburg in October 1518. The historian Berndt Hamm says that the meeting was the &quot;historical point at which the opposition between the Reformation and Catholicism first emerged&quot;, as Cajetan thought that believers accepting Luther&#x27;s views of justification would no more obey clerical guidance.

Luther first expressed his sympathy for Jan Hus at a disputation in Leipzig in June 1519. His case was reopened at the Roman Curia. Cajetan, Eck and other papal officials drafted the papal bull (&#x27;Arise, O Lord&#x27;) which was published on 15 June 1520. It condemned Luther&#x27;s forty-one theses, and offered a sixty-day-long grace period to him to recant. Luther&#x27;s theology quickly developed. In a Latin treatise &quot;On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church&quot;, he stated that only baptism and the Eucharist could be regarded as sacraments, and priests were not members of a privileged class but servants of the community (hence they became called ministers from the Latin word for servant). His German manifesto &quot;To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation&quot; associated the papacy with the Antichrist, and described the Holy See as &quot;the worst whorehouse of all whorehouses&quot; in reference to the funds flowing to the Roman Curia. It also challenged the Biblical justification of clerical celibacy. Luther&#x27;s study &quot;On the Freedom of a Christian&quot; consolidated his thoughts about the believers&#x27; inner freedom with their obligation to care for their neighbours although he rejected the traditional teaching about good works. The study is a characteristic example of Luther&#x27;s enthusiasm for paradoxes.

The papal nuncio Girolamo Aleandro (d. 1542) ordered the burning of Luther&#x27;s books. In response, Luther and his followers burned the papal bull along with a copy of the —the fundamental document of medieval ecclesiastic law—at Wittenberg. The papal bull excommunicating Luther was published on 3 January 1521. The newly elected Holy Roman Emperor Charles V () wanted to outlaw Luther at the Diet of Worms, but could not make the decision alone. The Holy Roman Empire was a confederation of autonomous states, and authority rested with the Imperial Diets where the Imperial Estates assembled. Frederick the Wise vetoed the imperial ban against Luther, and Luther was summoned to Worms to defend his case at the Diet in April 1521. Here he refused to recant stating that only arguments from the Bible could convince him that his works contained errors.

After Luther and his supporters left the Diet, those who remained sanctioned the imperial ban, threatening Luther&#x27;s supporters with imprisonment and confiscation of their property. To save Luther&#x27;s life but also to hide his involvement, Frederick arranged Luther&#x27;s abduction on 4 May. During his ten-month-long staged captivity at Frederick&#x27;s castle of Wartburg, Luther translated the New Testament to High German. The historian Diarmaid MacCulloch describes the translation as an &quot;extraordinary achievement that has shaped the German language ever since&quot;, adding that &quot;Luther&#x27;s gift was for seizing the emotion with sudden, urgent phrases&quot;. The translation would be published at the 1522 Leipzig Book Fair along with Luther&#x27;s treatise &quot;On Monastic Vows&quot; that laid the theological foundations of the dissolution of monasteries. Luther also composed religious hymns in Wartburg. They would be first published in collections in 1524. During Luther&#x27;s absence, his co-workers, primarily Philip Melanchthon (d. 1560) and Andreas Karlstadt (d. 1541) assumed the leadership of Reformation in Wittenberg. Melanchthon consolidated Luther&#x27;s thoughts into a coherent theological work titled (&#x27;Common Places&#x27;).

=== Spread ===


Roper argues that &quot;the most important reason why Luther did not meet with Hus&#x27;s fate was technology: the new medium of print&quot;. Luther was publishing his views in short but pungent treatises that gained unexpected popularity: he was responsible for about one-fifth of all works printed in Germany in the first third of the . German printing presses were scattered in many urban centers which prevented their control by central authorities. Statistical analysis indicates a significant correlation between the presence of a printing press in a German city and the adoption of Reformation.

Reformation spread through the activities of enthusiastic preachers such as Johannes Oecolampadius (d. 1531) and Konrad Kürsner (d. 1556) in Basel, Sebastian Hofmeister (d. 1533) in Schaffhausen, and Matthäus Zell (d. 1548) and Martin Bucer (d. 1551) in Strasbourg. They were called &quot;Evangelicals&quot; due to their insistence on teaching in accordance with the Gospels (or ). Luther and many of his followers worked with the artist Lucas Cranach the Elder (d. 1553) who had a keen sense of visualising their message. He produced Luther&#x27;s idealised portrait setting a template for further popular images printed on the covers of books. Cranach&#x27;s woodcuts together with itinerant preachers&#x27; explanations helped the mainly illiterate people to understand Luther&#x27;s teaching. The illustrated pamphlets were carried from place to place typically by peddlers and merchants. Laypeople started to discuss various aspects of religion in both private and public all over Germany.

The self-governing free imperial cities were the first centers of the Reformation. The Evangelical preachers emphasized that many of the well-established church practices had no precedent in the Bible. They offered the Eucharist to the laity in both kinds, and denied the clerics&#x27; monopolies, which resonated with popular anti-clericalism. It was not unusual that their supporters attacked clerics and church buildings. Violent iconoclasm was common.In some cities such as Strasbourg and Ulm, the urban magistrates supported the Reformation; in the cities of the Hanseatic League the affluent middle classes enforced changes in church life. Cities located closer to the most important ideological centers of the Reformation—Wittenberg and Basel—adopted its ideas more likely than other towns. This indicates the significance either of student networks, or of neighbours who had rejected Catholicism.

The sociologist Steven Pfaff underlines that &quot;ecclesiastical and liturgical reform was not simply a religious question ... since the sort of reforms demanded by Evangelicals could not be accommodated within existing institutions, prevailing customs, or established law&quot;. After their triumph, the reformers expelled their leading opponents, dissolved the monasteries and convents, secured the urban magistrates&#x27; control of the appointment of priests, and established new civic institutions. Evangelical town councils usually prohibited begging but established a common chest for poverty relief by expropriating the property of dissolved ecclesiastic institutions. The funds were used for the daily support of orphans, old people and the sick, but also for low-interest loans to the impoverished to start a business. Luther was convinced that only educated people could effectively serve both God and the community. Under his auspices, public schools and libraries were opened in many towns offering education to more children than the traditional monastic and cathedral schools.

=== Resistance and oppression ===
Resistance to Evangelical preaching was significant in Flanders, the Rhineland, Bavaria and Austria. Here the veneration of local saints was strong, and statistical analysis indicates that cities where indigenous saints&#x27; shrines served as centers of vivid communal cults less likely adopted Reformation. Likewise, cities with an episcopal see or monasteries more likely resisted Evangelical proselytism. 

Luther&#x27;s ideas were rejected by most representatives of the previous generation of Humanists. Erasmus stated that Luther&#x27;s &quot;unrestrained enthusiasm carries him beyond what is right&quot;. Jacob van Hoogstraaten (d. 1527) compared Luther&#x27;s theology of salvation &quot;as if Christ takes to himself the most foul bride and is unconcerned about her cleanliness&quot;. Luther&#x27;s works were burned in most European countries. Emperor Charles initiated the execution of the first Evangelical martyrs, the Augustinian monks Jan van Essen and Hendrik Vos. They were burned in Brussels on 1 July 1523. Charles was determined to protect the Catholic Church, but the Ottoman Turks&#x27; expansion towards Central Europe often thwarted him. The Spanish Inquisition prevented the spread of Evangelical literature in that country, and suppressed the spiritual movement of the (&#x27;Illuminists&#x27;) who put a special emphasis on personal faith. Some Italian men of letters, such as the Venetian nobleman Gasparo Contarini (d. 1542) and the Augustinian canon Peter Martyr Vermigli (d. 1562) expressed ideas resembling Luther&#x27;s theology of salvation but did not quickly break with Catholicism. They were part of a group known as . 

The English king Henry VIII () commissioned a team of theologians to defend the Catholic dogmas against Luther&#x27;s attacks. Their treatise titled &quot;The Assertion of the Seven Sacraments&quot; was published under Henry&#x27;s name, and the grateful Pope awarded him with the title Defender of the Faith. In Scotland, the first Evangelical preacher Patrick Hamilton (d. 1528) was burned for heresy. In France, the theologians of the Sorbonne stated that Luther &quot;vomited up a doctrine of pestilence&quot;. Guillaume Briçonnet (d. 1534), Bishop of Meaux, also condemned Luther but employed reform-minded clerics like Jacques Lefèvre d&#x27;Étaples (d. 1536) and William Farel (d. 1565) to renew religious life in his diocese. They enjoyed the protection of Marguerite of Angoulême (d. 1549), the well-educated sister of the French king Francis I (). The Parlement of Paris only took actions against them after Francis was captured in the Battle of Pavia in 1525, forcing many of them into exile.

Correspondence between Luke of Prague (d. 1528), leader of the Bohemian Brethren, and Luther made it clear that their theologies were incompatible even if their views about justification were similar. In Bohemia, Hungary, and Poland, Luther&#x27;s theology spread in the local German communities. King Louis of Bohemia and Hungary () ordered the persecution of Evangelical preachers although his wife Mary of Austria (d. 1558) favoured the reformers. Sigismund I the Old, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania () banned the import of Evangelical literature. Christian II, who ruled the Kalmar Union of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway (), was sympathetic towards the Reformation but his despotic methods led to revolts. He was replaced by his uncle Frederick I in Denmark and Norway (), and by a local aristocrat Gustav I Vasa in Sweden ().

==Alternatives==

=== Saxon radicals and rebellious knights ===

Andreas Karlstadt accelerated the implementation of Reformation in Wittenberg. On Christmas Day 1521, he administered the Eucharist in common garment; the next day he announced his engagement to a fifteen-year-old noble girl Anna von Mochau. He proclaimed that images were examples of &quot;devilish deceit&quot; which led to the mass destruction of religious art. Enthusiasts began swarming to Wittenberg. The Zwickau prophets, who had been incited by the radical preacher Thomas Müntzer (d. 1525), claimed that they had received revelations from God. They rejected transubstantiation and attacked infant baptism. Luther defended art as a proof of the beauty of the Creation, maintained that Christ&#x27;s Body and Blood were physically present in the Eucharist, and regarded infant baptism as a sign of membership in the Christian community. To put an end to the anarchy, Frederick the Wise released Luther in March 1522. Luther achieved the Zwickau prophets&#x27; removal from Wittenberg, calling them fanatics. Karlstadt voluntarily left Wittenberg for Orlamünde where the local congregation elected him its minister. Luther visited most parishes in the region to prevent radical reforms, but he was often received by verbal or physical abuses. When he wanted to dismiss Karlstadt, the parishioners referred to his own words about the congregations&#x27; right to freely elect their ministers, and Karlstadt called him a &quot;perverter of the Scriptures&quot;. Karlstadt was expelled from Electoral Saxony without a trial on Luther&#x27;s initiative.

Luther condemned violence but some of his followers took up arms. Franz von Sickingen (d. 1523), an imperial knight from the Rhineland, formed an alliance with his peers against Richard von Greiffenklau, Archbishop-elector of Trier (), allegedly to lead the Archbishop&#x27;s subjects &quot;to evangelical, light laws and Christian freedom&quot;. Sickingen had demanded the restitution of monastic property to the grantors&#x27; descendants, stating that the secularisation of church property would also improve the poor peasants&#x27; situation. Sickingen and his associates attacked the archbishopric but failed at the siege of Trier. Sickingen was mortally wounded while defending his Nanstein Castle against the Archbishop&#x27;s troops. Luther denounced Sickingen&#x27;s violent acts. According to his &quot;theory of two kingdoms&quot;, true Christians had to submit themselves to princely authority.

=== Zwingli ===


The Swiss Humanist priest Huldrych Zwingli would claim that he &quot;began to preach the Gospel of Christ in 1516 long before anyone in our region had ever heard of Luther&quot;. He came to prominence when attended a meal of sausages in Zürich during Lent 1522, breaching the rules of fasting. He held disputations with the urban magistrates&#x27; authorization to discuss changes in church life, and always introduced them with the magistrates&#x27; support. In 1524, all images were removed from the churches, and fasting and clerical celibacy were abolished. Two years later, a German communion service replaced the Latin liturgy of the Mass, and the Eucharist (or Lord&#x27;s Supper) was administered on a plain wooden table instead of an embellished altar. Two new institutions were organised in Zürich: the (a public school for Biblical studies), and the Marriage and Morals Court (a legal court and moral police consisting of two laymen and two clerics). Both would be copied in other towns. Zwingli&#x27;s interpretation of the Eucharist differed from both Catholic theology and Luther&#x27;s teaching. He denied Christ&#x27;s presence in the sacramental bread and wine, and regarded the Eucharist as a commemorative ceremony in honor of the crucified Jesus. The disagreement caused a bitter pamphlet war between Luther and Zwingli. They both rejected intermediary Eucharistic formulas coined by Bucer.

=== Swiss Brethren ===

Zwingli&#x27;s cautious &quot;Magisterial Reformation&quot; outraged the more radical reformers, among them Conrad Grebel (d. 1526), a Zürich patrician&#x27;s son who had fallen out with his family for marrying a low born girl. The radicals summarized their theology in a letter to Müntzer in 1524. They identified the Church as an exclusive community of the righteous, and demanded its liberation from the state. They deplored all religious practices that had no Biblical foundations, and endorsed believers&#x27; (or adult) baptism. 

In January 1525, a former Catholic priest George Blaurock (d. 1529) asked Grebel to rebaptize him, and after his request was granted they rebaptized fifteen other people. For this practice, they were called Anabaptists (&#x27;rebaptizers&#x27;). As a featuring element of Donatism and other heretic movements, rebaptism had been a capital offence since the Late Roman period. After the magistrates had some radicals imprisoned, Blaurock called Zwingli the Antichrist. The town council enacted a law that threatened rebaptizers with capital punishment, and the Anabaptist Felix Manz (d. 1527) was condemned to death and drowned in the Limmat River. He was the first victim of religious persecution by reformist authorities. The purge convinced many Anabaptists that they were the true heirs to early Christians who had suffered martyrdom for their faith. The most radicals took inspiration from the Book of Daniel and the Book of Revelation for apocalyptic prophesies. Some of them burnt the Bible reciting St Paul&#x27;s words, &quot;the letter kills&quot;. In St. Gallen, Anabaptist women cut their hair short to avoid arousing sexual passion, while a housemaid Frena Bumenin proclaimed herself the New Messiah before announcing that she would give birth to the Antichrist.

According to Dr Kenneth R. Davis, &quot;the Anabaptists can best be understood as, apart from their own creativity, a radicalization and Protestantization not of the Magisterial Reformation but of the lay-oriented, ascetic reformation of which Erasmus is the principle mediator.&quot;

=== Peasants&#x27; War ===

MacCulloch says that the Reformation &quot;injected an extra element of instability&quot; into the relationship between the peasants and their lords, as it raised &quot;new excitement and bitterness against established authority&quot;. Public demonstrations in the Black Forest area indicated a general discontent among the southern German peasantry in May 1524. The Anabaptist preacher Balthasar Hubmaier (d. 1528) was one of the peasant leaders, but most participants never went beyond traditional anti-clericalism. In early 1525, the movement spread towards Upper Swabia. The radical preacher Cristopher Schappler and the pamphleteer Sebastian Lotzer summarized the Swabian peasants&#x27; demand in a manifesto known as &quot;Twelve Articles&quot;. The peasants wanted to control their ministers&#x27; election and to supervise the use of church revenues, but also demanded the abolition of the tithe on meat. They reserved the right to present further demands against non-Biblical seigneurial practices but promised to abandon any of their demands that contradicted the Bible, and appointed fourteen &quot;arbitrators&quot; to clarify divine law on the relationship between peasants and landlords. The arbitrators approached Luther, Zwingli, Melanchthon and other leaders of the Reformation for advice but none of them answered. Luther wrote a treatise, equally blaming the landlords for the oppression of the peasantry and the rebels for their arbitrary acts.

Georg Truchsess von Waldburg (d. 1531), commander of the army of the aristocratic Swabian League, achieved the dissolution of the peasant armies either by force or through negotiations. By this time the peasant movements reached Franconia and Thüringia. The Franconian peasants formed alliances with artisans and petty nobles such as Florian Geyer (d. 1525) against the patricians and the Prince-Bishopric of Würzburg but Truchsess forced them into submission. In Thüringia, Müntzer convinced 300 radicals that they were invincible but they were annihilated at Frankenhausen by Philip the Magnanimous, Landgrave of Hesse () and George, Duke of Saxony (). Müntzer who had hidden in an attic before the battle was discovered and executed. News of atrocities by peasant bands and meetings with disrespectful peasants during a preaching tour outraged Luther while he was writing his treatise &quot;Against the Murderous, Thieving Hordes of Peasants&quot;. In it, he urged the German princes to &quot;smite, slay, and slab&quot; the rebels. Moderate observers felt aggrieved at his cruel words. They regarded as an especially tasteless act that Luther married Katharina von Bora (d. 1552), a former nun while the punitive actions against the peasantry were still in process. Further peasant movements began in other regions in Central Europe but they were pacified through concessions or suppressed by force before the end of 1525.

==Consolidation==

===Princely Reformation in Germany===

The Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights Albert of Brandenburg-Ansbach () was the first prince to formally abandon Catholicism. The Teutonic Order held Royal Prussia in fief of Poland. After defeats in a war against Poland and Lithuania demoralised the Knights, Albert transformed the region into the hereditary Duchy of Prussia in April 1525. As the secularisation of Prussia represented an open rebellion against Catholicism, it was followed by the establishment of the first Evangelical state church. In August, Albert&#x27;s brothers, Casimir () and George () instructed the priests in Brandenburg-Kulmbach and Brandenburg-Ansbach to pray the doctrine of justification by faith alone. The Reformation was officially introduced in Electoral Saxony under John the Constant () on Christmas Day 1525. Electoral Saxony&#x27;s conversion facilitated the adoption of the Reformation in smaller German states, such as Mansfeld and Hessen. Philip of Hessen founded the first Evangelical university at his capital Marburg in 1527.

At the Diet of Speyer in 1526, the German princes agreed that they would &quot;live, govern, and act in such a way as everyone trusted to justify before God and the Imperial Majesty&quot;. In practice, they sanctioned the principle (&#x27;whose realm, their religion&#x27;), acknowledging the princes&#x27; right to determine their subjects&#x27; religious affiliation. Fully occupied with the War of the League of Cognac against France and its Italian allies, Emperor Charles had appointed his brother Ferdinand I, Archduke of Austria () to represent him in Germany. They both opposed the compromise, but Ferdinand was brought into succession struggles in Bohemia and Hungary after their brother-in-law King Louis died in the Battle of Mohács. In 1527, Charles&#x27;s mutinous troops sacked Rome and took Pope Clement VII () under custody. Luther stated that &quot;Christ reigns in such a way that the emperor who persecutes Luther for the pope is forced to destroy the pope for Luther&quot;.

After his experiences with radical communities, Luther no more wrote of the congregations&#x27; right to elect their ministers (or pastors). Instead, he expected that princes acting as &quot;emergency bishops&quot; would prevent the disintegration of the Church. Close cooperation between clerics and princely officials at church visitations paved the way for the establishment of the new church system. In Electoral Saxony, princely decrees enacted the Evangelical ideas. Liturgy was simplified, the church courts&#x27; jurisdiction over secular cases was abolished, and state authorities took control of church property. The Evangelical equivalent to bishop was created with the appointment of a former Catholic priest Johannes Bugenhagen (d. 1558) as superintendent in 1533. The church visitations convinced Luther that the villagers&#x27; knowledge of the Christian faith was imperfect. To deal with the situation, he completed two cathecisms—the &quot;Large Catechism&quot; for the education of priests, and the &quot;Small Catechism&quot; for children. Records from Brandenburg-Ansbach indicates that Evangelical pastors often attacked traditional communal activities such as church fairs and spinning bees for debauchery.

Taking advantage of Emperor Charles&#x27; victories in Italy, achieved the reinforcement of the imperial ban against Luther at the Diet of Speyer in 1529. In response, five imperial princes and fourteen imperial cities presented a formal . They were mocked as &quot;Protestants&quot;, and this appellation would be quickly applied to all followers of the new theologies. To promote Protestant unity, Philip the Magnanimous organised a colloquy (or theological debate) between Luther, Melanchton, Zwingli and Oecolampadius at Marburg early in October 1529, but they could not coin a common formula on the Eucharist. During the discussion, Luther remarked that &quot;Our spirit has nothing in common with your spirit&quot;, expressing the rift between the two mainstream versions of the Reformation. Zwingli&#x27;s followers started to call themselves the &quot;Reformed&quot;, as they regarded themselves as the true reformers.

===Stalemate in Switzerland===


In 1526, the villagers of the autonomous Graubünden region in Switzerland agreed that each village could freely choose between Protestantism and Catholicism, setting a precedent for the coexistence of the two denominations in the same jurisdiction. Religious affiliation in the Mandated Territories (lands jointly administered by the Swiss cantons) became the subject of much controversy between Protestant and Catholic cantons. The Protestant cantons concluded a military alliance early in 1529, the Catholic cantons in April. After a bloodless armed conflict, the Mandated communities were granted the right to choose between the two religions by a majority vote of the male citizens. Zwingli began an intensive proselityzing campaign which led to the conversion of most Mandated communities to Protestantism. He set up a council of clergymen and lay delegates for church administration, thus creating the forerunners of presbyteries. Zürich imposed an economic blockade on the Catholic cantons but the Catholics routed Zürich&#x27;s army in 1531. The Catholics&#x27; victory stopped the Protestant expansion in Switzerland. 

Zwingli was killed in the battlefield, and succeeded by a former monk Heinrich Bullinger (d. 1575) in Zürich. Bullinger developed Zwingli&#x27;s Eucharistic formula in an attempt to reach a compromise with Luther, saying that the faithful made spiritual contact with God during the commemorative ceremony.

===&quot;Schleitheim Articles&quot;===

The historian Carter Lindberg states that the &quot;Peasants&#x27; War was a formative experience for many leaders of Anabaptism&quot;. Hans Hut (d. 1527) continued Müntzer&#x27;s apocalyticism but others rejected all forms of violence. 

The pacifist Michael Sattler (d. 1527) took the chair at an Anabaptist assembly at Schleitheim in February 1527. Here the participants adopted an anti-militarist program now known as the &quot;Schleitheim Articles&quot;. The document ordered the believers&#x27; separation from the evil world, and prohibited oath-taking, bearing of arms and holding of civic offices. Facing Ottoman expansionism, the Austrian authorities considered this pacifism as a direct threat to their country&#x27;s defense. Sattler was quickly captured and executed. During his trial, he stated that &quot;If the Turks should come, we ought not to resist them. For it is written: Thou shalt not kill.&quot;

Total segregation was alien to Hübmaier who tried to achieve a peaceful coexistence with non-Anabaptists. Expelled from Zürich, he settled in the Moravian domains of Count Leonhard von Liechtenstein at Nikolsburg (now Mikulov, Czech Republic). He baptised infants on the parents&#x27; request for which hard-line Anabaptists regarded him as an evil compromiser. He was sentenced to death and burned at the stake for heresy on &#x27;s orders. His execution inaugurated a period of intensive purge against rebaptisers. His followers relocated to Austerlitz (now Slavkov u Brna, Czech Republic) where refugees from Tyrol joined them. After the Tyrolian Jakob Hutter (d. 1536) assumed the leadership of the community, they began to held their goods in common. The Bohemian Brethren symphatised with the Hutterites which facilitated their survival in Moravia.

===Confessions===

Back in Germany in January 1530, asked the Protestants to summarize their theology at the following Diet in Augsburg. As the imperial ban prevented Luther from attending the Diet, Melanchthon completed the task. Melanchthon sharply condemned Anabaptist ideas and adopted a reconciliatory tone towards Catholicism but did not fail to emphasize the most featuring elements of Evangelical theology, such as justification by faith alone. The twenty-eight articles of the &quot;Augsburg Confession&quot; were presented at the Diet on 25 June. Four south German Protestant cities—Strasbourg, Constance, Lindau, and Memmingen—adopted a separate confessional document, the &quot;Tetrapolitan Confession&quot; because they were influenced by Zwingli&#x27;s Eucharistic theology. On Charles&#x27;s request, Eck and other Catholic theologians completed a response to the &quot;Augsburg Confession&quot;, called (&#x27;refutation&#x27;). Charles ordered the Evangelical theologians to admit that their argumentation had been completely refuted. Instead, Melanchthon wrote a detailed explanation for the Evangelical articles of faith, known as the &quot;Apology of the Augsburg Confession&quot;.

Charles wanted to attack the Protestant princes and cities but the Catholic princes did not support him fearing that his victory would strengthen his power. The Diet passed a law prohibiting further religious innovations and ordering the Protestants to return to Catholicism until 15 April 1531. Luther had previously questioned the princes&#x27; right to resist imperial power, but by then he had concluded that a defensive war for religious purposes could be regarded as a just war. The Schmalkaldic League—the Protestant Imperial Estates&#x27; defensive alliance—was signed by five princes and fourteen cities on 27 February 1531. As a new Ottoman invasion prevented the Habsburgs from wage war against the Protestants, a peace treaty was signed at Nuremberg in July 1532.

===Royal Reformation in Scandinavia===

Relationship between the papacy and the Scandinavian kingdoms was tense, as both of Denmark and Norway, and of Sweden appointed their own candidates to vacant episcopal sees. In 1526, the Danish Parliament prohibited the bishops to seek confirmation from the Holy See, and declared all fees payable for their confirmation as royal revenue. The former Hospitaller knight Hans Tausen (d. 1561) delivered Evangelical sermons in Viborg under royal protection from 1526. Four years later, the Parliament rejected the Catholic prelates&#x27; demand to condemn Evangelical preaching. After Frederick&#x27;s death the bishops and conservative aristocrats prevented the election of his openly Protestant son Christian as his successor. Christopher, Count of Oldenburg () took up arms on the deposed &#x27;s behalf, but the war known as Count&#x27;s Feud ended with the victory of Frederick&#x27;s son who ordered the arrest of the Catholic bishops. () was crowned king by Bugenhagen. Bugenhagen also ordained seven superintendents to lead the Church of Denmark. Christian declared the &quot;Augsburg Confession&quot; as the authoritative articles of faith in 1538, but pilgrimages to the most popular shrines continued, and the Eucharistic liturgy kept Catholic elements, such as kneeling.

In the Danish dependencies of Norway and Iceland, the Reformation required vigorous governmental interventions. The last Catholic Archbishop of Nidaros in Norway Olav Engelbrektsson (d. 1538) was a staunch opponent of the changes, but was succeeded by the Evangelical Gjeble Pederssøn (d. 1557) as superintendent. In Iceland, Jón Arason, Bishop of Hólar (d. 1550)—the last Nordic Catholic bishop—took up arms to prevent the Reformation, but he was captured and executed by representatives of royal authority.
 of Sweden appointed the Evangelical preacher Laurentius Andreae (d. 1552) as his chancellor, and the Evangelical scholar Olaus Petri (d. 1552) as a minister at Stockholm. Petri translated the Gospels to Swedish. On his advice, Gustav dissolved a Catholic printing house that published popular anti-Protestant literature under the auspices of Hans Brask (d. 1538), Bishop of Linköping. Gustav also expelled the radical German pastor Melchior Hoffman (d. 1543) from Sweden for iconoclastic propaganda. The royal treasury needed extra funds to repay the loans borrowed from the Hanseatic League to finance the war against . Gustav persuaded the legislative assembly to secularise church property by threatening the delegates with his abdication. The peasantry remained very cautious about changes in church life. This together with heavy taxation led to uprisings. To appease the rebels, Gustav declared that he had not sanctioned the changes, and dismissed Andreae in 1531, Petri in 1533. He continued the transformation of church life in Sweden and Finland after the Reformation was fully introduced in Denmark. He was assisted by two Evangelical theologians Georg Norman (d. 1552/1553) and Mikael Agricola (d. 1557). In 1539, Norman was appointed as supertindent of the Church of Sweden, and Gustav took the title of &quot;Supreme Defender of the Church&quot;.

==Catholic reform==
===Beginnings===
The religious upheaval in Germany and the sack of Rome convinced many Catholics that their Church was in need of a profound reform. Pope Paul III () appointed prominent representatives of the Catholic reform movement as cardinals, among them Contarini, Reginald Pole (d. 1558), and Giovanni Pietro Caraffa (d. 1559). They completed a report condemning the corruption of church administration and the waste of church revenues. Contarini, Pole and other were ready to make concessions to the Protestants but their liberalism shocked Caraffa and other conservative prelates.

Negotiations between moderate Catholic and Protestant theologians were not unusual. In 1541, Bucer and the Catholic theologian Johann Gropper (d. 1559) drafted a compromise formula on justification. The draft was discussed along with other issues at a colloquy during the Diet of Regensburg but no compromise was reached, not least due to opposition by both Luther and the Holy See. Contarini, who represented the papacy at the Diet, died in 1541; many such as Vermigli fled from Italy to avoid persecution. Hermann of Wied, Archbishop-elector of Cologne () completed a reform program with Bucer&#x27;s assistance, criticising prayers to the saints and traditional Eucharistic theology, and proposing sermons about justification by faith. The canons of the Cologne Cathedral requested Gropper to write a critical response to it, and achieved Hermann&#x27;s deposal by the Roman Curia.

===New Orders===

The spread of new monastic orders was an important element of the Catholic reform movement. Most new orders placed great value on pastoral care. Among them, the Society of Jesus (or Jesuits) became the most influential. Its founder Ignatius of Loyola (d. 1556) was born to a Basque noble family. He chose a military career but abandoned it after being wounded during a siege. He started to write a devotional guide, the &quot;Spiritual Exercises&quot;, during his ascetic retreat at a cave. His mysticism arouse the Spanish Inquisition&#x27;s suspicion but the supported him. sanctioned the establishment of the Jesuits on Contarini&#x27;s influence in 1540. The new order quickly developed: when Loyola died, the Society had about 1,000 members; in less than a decade, it numbered around 3,500. The maintenance of a well organised schooling system was the Jesuits&#x27; most prominent feature. Their Roman collegium prepared future priests to discuss and reject Protestant theologies primarily in Germany, Bohemia, Poland, and Hungary.

===Council of Trent===

 decided to convoke the nineteenth ecumenical council to handle the crisis caused by the Reformation. The Council of Trent met in a series of sessions from December 1545 to 1548, 1521 to 1522, and 1562 to 1563. The topics dealt with included the Creed, the Sacraments including transubstantiation and ordination, justification, and improvement in the quality of priests by diocesan seminaries and annual canonical visitations. The council reaffirmed that apostolic tradition was as authentic a source of faith as the Bible, and emphasized the importance of good works in salvation, rejecting two important elements of Luther&#x27;s theology. Before being closed in December 1563, the Council mandate the papacy to revise liturgical books and complete a new catechism. Carlo Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan (d. 1582) adopted a more practical approach. He completed a handbook covering everyday details of church life, including the delivery of sermons, arrangement of church interiors, and hearing confessions. After the council, papal authority was reinforced through the establishment of central offices known as congregations. One of them became responsible for the list of forbidden literature. All church officials and university teachers were required to take a Tridentine confessional oath that included an oath of &quot;true obedience&quot; to the papacy.

Lindberg suggests that (following Trent) the &quot;spirituality of Catholic reform was the ascetic, subjective, and personal piety&quot;, as expressed in public processions, the &quot;perpetual&quot; adoration of the Eucharist, and the reaffirmed veneration of Mary the Virgin and the saints.

==New waves==

===English reformation under Henry VIII===


In England, reformist clerics such as Thomas Bilney (d. 1531) and Robert Barnes (d. 1540) spread Luther&#x27;s theology among Cambridge and Oxford scholars and students. The young priest William Tyndale (d. 1536) translated the New Testament to English using Erasmus&#x27;s Latin-Greek edition. By around 1535, more than 15,000 copies of his translation had been distributed in secret. Tyndale&#x27;s biographer David Daniell (d. 2016) writes that the translation &quot;gave the English language a plain prose style of the very greatest importance&quot;, and his &quot;influence has been greater than any other writer in English&quot;.

The Lord Chancellor Cardinal Thomas Wolsey (d. 1530) had strong links to the Roman Curia, he was unable to achieve the annulment of the marriage of and the middle-aged Catherine of Aragon (d. 1536). They had needed a papal dispensation to marry because Catherine was the widow of Henry&#x27;s brother Arthur, Prince of Wales (d. 1502). As she had not produced a male heir, Henry became convinced that their incestuous marriage drew the wrath of God.

Henry charged a group of scholars including Thomas Cranmer (d. 1556) with collecting arguments in favour of the annulment. They concluded that the English kings had always had authority over the clergy, and the Book of Leviticus forbade marriage between a man and his brother&#x27;s widow in all circumstances. In 1530, the Parliament limited the jurisdiction of church courts. Wolsey had meanwhile lost Henry&#x27;s favour and died, but More tried to convince Henry to abandon his plan about the annulment of his marriage. In contrast, Cranmer and Henry&#x27;s new chief advisor Thomas Cromwell (d. 1540) argued that the marriage could be annulled without papal interference. Henry who had fallen in love with Catherine&#x27;s lady-in-waiting Anne Boleyn (d. 1536) decided to marry her even if the marriage could lead to a total break with the papacy. During a visit in Germany, Cranmer married but kept his marriage in secret. On his return to England, Henry appointed him as the new Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Holy See confirmed the appointment.

The links between the English Church and the papacy were severed by Acts of Parliament. In April 1533, the Act of Appeals decreed that only English courts had jurisdiction in cases of last wills, marriages and grants to the Church, emphasizing that &quot;this realm of England is an Empire&quot;. A special church court annulled the marriage of Henry and Catherine, and declared their only daughter Mary (d. 1558) illegitimate in May 1533. did not sanction the judgement and excommunicated Henry. Ignoring the papal ban, Henry married Anne, and she gave birth to a daughter Elizabeth (d. 1603). Anne was a staunch supporter of the Reformation, and mainly her nominees were appointed to the vacant bishoprics between 1532 and 1536. In 1534, the Act of Supremacy declared the king the &quot;only supreme head of the Church of England&quot;. Many of those who refused to swear a special oath of loyalty to the king—65 from about 400 defendants—were executed. More and John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester (d. 1535) were among the most prominent victims. Cromwell gradually convinced Henry that a &quot;purification&quot; of church life was needed. The number of feast days was reduced by about 75 per cent, pilgrimages were forbidden, all monasteries were dissolved and their property was seized by the Crown.

The Parliament of Ireland passed similar acts but they could only be fully implemented in the lands under direct English rule. Resistance against the Reformation was vigorous. In 1534, the powerful Lord Thomas FitzGerald (d. 1537) staged a revolt. Although it was crushed, thereafter Henry&#x27;s government did not introduce drastic changes in the Church of Ireland. In England, the dissolution of monasteries caused a popular revolt known as the Pilgrimage of Grace. The &quot;pilgrims&quot; demanded the dismissal of &quot;heretic&quot; royal advisors but they were overcame by royalist forces. The principal articles of faith of the Church of England were summarized in the &quot;Six Articles&quot; in 1539. It reaffirmed several elements of traditional theology, such as transubstantiation and clerical celibacy.

As Anne Boleyn did not give birth to a son, she lost Henry&#x27;s favour. She was executed for adultery, and Elizabeth was declared a bastard. Henry&#x27;s only son Edward (d. 1553) was born to Henry&#x27;s third wife Jane Seymour (d. 1537). In 1543, an Act of Parliament returned Mary and Elizabeth to the line of the succession behind Edward. Henry attacked Scotland to enforce the marriage of Edward and the infant Mary, Queen of Scots () but her mother Mary of Guise (d. 1560) reinforced Scotland&#x27;s traditional alliance with France. The priest George Wishart (d. 1546) was the first to preach Zwinglian theology in Scotland. After he was burned for heresy, his followers, among them John Knox (d. 1572), assassinated Cardinal David Beaton, Archbishop of St Andrews (d. 1546), but French troops crushed their revolt.

===Münster===

Having been banished from Sweden, Hoffman was wandering in southern Germany and the Low Countries. He turned Anabaptist but suspended adult baptism to avoid persecution. He denied that Christ had become flesh, and preached that 144,000 elect were to gather in Strasbourg to witness Christ&#x27;s return in 1533. His followers known as Melchiorites swarmed into the city, presenting an enormous challenge for its charity provisions. Hoffman also came to Strasbourg, but the authorities arrested him. After the deadline for Christ&#x27;s return passed uneventfully, many disappointed Melchiorites accepted the leadership of a charismatic Dutch baker Jan Matthijszoon (d. 1534). He blamed Hoffman for the suspension of adult baptism, and proclaimed the city of Münster as the New Jerusalem. Although Münster was an episcopal see, the town council had installed a Protestant pastor Bernhard Rothmann (d. 1535) in clear defiance to the new prince-bishop Franz von Waldeck (). Those who expected a radical social transformation from the Reformation flocked to Münster. The radicals assumed full control of the town in February 1534.

Bishop Franz and his allies, among them Philip of Hessen, attacked Münster but could not capture it. Under Matthijszoon&#x27;s rule, private property and the use of money was outlawed in the town. Believing that God would protect him, Matthijszoon made a sortie against the enemy, but he was killed. Another charismatic Dutchman, John of Leiden (d. 1536)—a former tailor—succeeded him. Leiden announced that he was receiving revelations from God, and proclaimed himself &quot;king of righteousness&quot; and &quot;the ruler of the new Zion&quot;. Church and state were united, and all sinners were executed. Leiden legalized polygyny, and ordered all women who were twelve or older to marry. The protracted siege demoralized the defenders, and Münster fell through treason on 25 June 1535. After the fall of Münster, most Anabaptist groups adopted a pacifist approach under the leadership of a former priest Menno Simons (d. 1561). He associated the Anabaptist communities with the New Jerusalem. His followers would be known as Mennonites. Nearly all Anabaptist communities were destroyed in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, but moderate Anabaptist groups survived in East Frisia, and were mainly tolerated in England.

===Calvin and the &quot;Institutes of the Christian Religion&quot;===

The future reformer John Calvin (d. 1564) was destined to a church career by his father, a lay administrator of the Bishopric of Noyon in France. He studied theology at the Sorbonne, and law at Orléans and Bourges. He read treatises by Lefèvre and Lefèvre&#x27;s disciples at the newly established , and abandoned Catholicism under the influence of his Protestant friends, particularly the physician Nicolas Cop (d. 1540). The persecution of French Protestants intensified after the so-called Affair of the Placards. In October 1534, placards (or posters) attacking the Mass were placed at many places, including the door to the royal bedchamber in Château d&#x27;Amboise. In retaliation, twenty-four Protestants were executed, and many intellectuals had to leave France.

Calvin was one of the religious refugees. He settled in Basel and completed the first version of his principal theological treatise, the &quot;Institutes of the Christian Religion&quot; in 1536. He would be rewriting and expanding it several times until 1559. As the historian Carlos Eire writes, &quot;Calvin&#x27;s text was blessed with a lawyer&#x27;s penchant for precision, a humanist&#x27;s love for poetic expression and rhetorical flourishes, and a theologian&#x27;s respect for paradox&quot;. With Eire&#x27;s words, Calvin &quot;revived the jealous God of the Old Testament&quot;. He warned King Francis that the persecution of the faithful would incur the wrath of God upon him but sharply distanced moderate Protestants from Anabaptists. Already the first edition of the &quot;Institutes&quot; contained references to two distinguishing elements of Calvin&#x27;s theology, both traceable back to Augustine: his conviction that the original sin had completely corrupted human nature, and his strong belief in &quot;double predestination&quot;. In his view, only strict social and ecclesiastic control could prevent sins and crimes, and God did not only decide who were saved but also those who were destined to damnation.

In 1536, Farel convinced Calvin to settle in Geneva. Their attempts to implement radical reforms in discipline brought them into conflicts with those who feared that the new measures would lead to clerical despotism. After they refused to acknowledge the urban magistrates&#x27; claim to intervene in the process of excommunication, they were banished from the town. Calvin moved to Strasbourg where Bucer made a profound impact on him. Under Bucer&#x27;s influence, Calvin adopted an intermediate position on the Eucharist between Luther and Zwingli, denying Christ&#x27;s presence in it but acknowledging that the rite included a real spiritual communion with Christ.

After Calvin and Farel left Geneva, no pastors were able to assume the leadership of the local Protestant community. Fearing of a Catholic restoration, the urban magistrates convinced Calvin to come back to Geneva in 1541. Months after his return, the town council enacted &quot;The Ecclesiastical Ordinances&quot;, a detailed regulation summarizing Calvin&#x27;s proposals for church administration. The &quot;Ordinances&quot; established four church offices. The pastors were responsible for pastoral care and discipline; the doctors instructed believers in the faith; the elders (or presbyters) were authorized to &quot;watch over the life of each person&quot; and to report those who lived a &quot;disorderly&quot; life to the pastors; and deacons were appointed to administer the town&#x27;s charity. All townspeople were obliged to regularly attend church services. Calvin established a special court called the consistory to hear cases of moral lapse such as blasphemy, adultery, disrespect to authorities, gossiping, witchcraft and participation in rites considered superstitious by church authorities. The consistory was composed of the pastors, the elders, and an urban magistrate, and the townspeople were encouraged to report sinful acts to it. First-time offenders mainly received lenient sentences such as fines, but repeat offenders were banished from the town or executed. Resistance against the &quot;Ordinances&quot; was significant. Many continued visit shrines and pray to saints, while many patricians insisted on liberal traditional customs for which Calvin called them &quot;Libertines&quot;.

===Reformation in Britain===

 died on 27 January 1547. His nine-year-old son () succeeded him, and Edward&#x27;s maternal uncle Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset (d. 1552) assumed power as Lord Protector. Somerset halted the persecution of religious dissidents, making England a safe haven for religious refugees from all over Europe. They established their own congregations, served by prominent pastors, such as the Polish Jan Łaski (d. 1560) and the Spanish Casiodoro de Reina (d. 1594). Most of them adhered to Reformed theology. Cranmer introduced further religious reforms: images were removed from the churches, the doctrine of purgatory was rejected, and all endowments for prayers for the dead (or chantries) were confiscated. With the introduction of Cranmer&#x27;s &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, the Mass was replaced by a vernacular liturgy.

Marshall notes, that it is &quot;safe to say that the greater part of the population disliked what was taking place&quot;. The liturgical changes caused popular revolts in Devon and Cornwall and other places but they were quickly suppressed, just like the riot against the dissolution of chantries in East Yorkshire. Even in Norfolk, where the peasants adopted a Protestant rhetoric, they assembled under the banners of their parish saints. Somerset&#x27;s opponents take advantage of the unrest to get rid of him. He was replaced by John Dudley (d. 1553) who was made Duke of Northumberland. Cranmer continued the liturgical reforms, and the new version of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; rejected the dogma of transubstantiation. He completed the &quot;Forty-two Articles&quot;, a new confessional document combining elements of Reformed and Evangelical theologies.

Edward died of tuberculosis on 6 July 1553. He had designated his Protestant relative Jane Grey (d. 1554) as his heir to prevent the succession of his Catholic sister Mary, but most English remained loyal to the Tudor dynasty. Initially, () took advantage of her royal prerogatives to dismiss married clergy, appoint Catholic priests to bishoprics, and restore the Mass. She had to make concessions to landowners who had seized church property to achieve the restoration of papal supremacy by the Parliament in November 1554. Cranmer was forced to sign six documents condemning his own acts but withdrew his recantations while being burned for heresy in public in March 1556. Reginald Pole was appointed as the new archbishop of Canterbury, but he was accused of heresy after his old enemy Carafa had been elected pope as (). The restoration of the altars and images gained popular support in many places, but recatholisation faced significant resistance—around 300 Protestants were burned, and about 1,000 were forced into exile during Mary&#x27;s reign. Her marriage with of Spain was unpopular, and she died childless on 17 November 1558.

Mary&#x27;s sister and successor () sought a (&#x27;middle way&#x27;) between religious extremists. Her first Parliament restored the royal leadership of the Church of England, and introduced a modified version of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. The Anglican liturgy retained elements of Catholic ceremonies, such as priestly vestments, and contained ambiguous sentences about the Eucharist, suggesting the real presence of Jesus&#x27;s Blood and Body for conservatives, and a memorial service for reformers. Elizabeth supervised the revision of the Anglican articles of faith in person. The subsequent &quot;Thirty-nine Articles&quot; were formulated in a way that adherents to the major mainstream Protestant theologies could accept them. However, the most resolute Protestants were determined to purify the Church of England from the remnants of Catholic ceremonies, hence they were called Puritans. They were especially influential at the universities. Many of them rejected the authority of bishops, the Presbyterians emphasized the equal status of all priests, whereas the Congregationalists wanted to strengthen the position of local communities in church administration.

England&#x27;s recatholisation contributed to the triumph of Reformation in Scotland. James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran (d. 1575), heir presumptive to Queen Mary of the Scots, assumed the leadership of the Protestant lords. Incited by Knox&#x27;s passionate sermons, anti-Catholic sentiments led to a popular revolt of elementary force in 1559, causing the destruction of monasteries and friaries.

===Servetus and the &quot;Restoration of Christianity&quot;===

The first radicals who rejected the dogma of Trinity were put on trial in Augsburg in 1527. A scholar from Navarre Michael Servetus (d. 1553) adopted antitrinitarian theology in the 1530s. MacCulloch proposes that Servetus rejected the Trinity, a dogma extremely offensive to Jews and Muslims, because he wanted to present Christianity as a universal religion. After studying medicine and anatomy in Paris, Servetus became the court physician of the elderly Catholic archbishop of Vienne in southern France. While in Vienne, he sent the first (unpublished) versions of his theological work, the &quot;Restoration of Christianity&quot; to Calvin. He disrespectfully described the Trinity as a three-headed Cerberus, attacked infant baptism, and denied original sin. He also wrote insulting comments on Calvin&#x27;s &quot;Institutes&quot;. The &quot;Restoration&quot; was published anonymously in Lyon in 1553, but the Catholic Inquisition identified Servetus as its author by using documents from Calvin&#x27;s personal files. Servetus fled from France but attended a church service delivered by Calvin in Geneva. He was recognised and arrested, and the urban authorities sentenced him to death with Calvin&#x27;s consent. He was burned at the stake on 27 October 1553.

Bucer, Melanchthon and other leading Protestant theologians agreed with Servetus&#x27;s execution. Only the Basel-based schoolmaster Sebastian Castellio (d. 1563) condemned it in a manifesto for religious toleration. He also addressed a letter to Calvin, stating &quot;To burn a heretic is not to defend a doctrine, but to kill a man&quot;. Antitrinitarian theology survived among Italian exiles in Basel. Lelio Sozzini (d. 1562), a scholar from Siena, argued that Biblical texts calling Jesus &quot;Son of God&quot; did not refer to his divinity but to his faultless humanity. His nephew, Fausto Sozzini (d. 1604) rejected the theory of satisfaction (the concept that Christ&#x27;s sufferings brought about atonement to God the Father for the original sin). The two Sozzinis also believed that human nature was essentially good. Their followers became known as Socinians.

After Servetus&#x27;s execution Calvin strengthened his position as the leading figure of Reformed Protestantism. In Geneva, the Libertines rose up but they were quickly overcame, and forced into exile or executed. The confiscation of the property of the wealthy Ami Perrin (d. 1561) and his family provided the city with funds to create an academy. It served both as a preparatory school for local youths and as a seminary for Reformed ministers. Calvin&#x27;s chief assistant Theodore Beza (d. 1605) was appointed as its first rector. The academy quickly developed into a principal center of theologian training for students from all over Europe, earning Geneva the nickname &quot;the Protestant Rome&quot;. It was especially popular among French Protestants.

==Wars of religion and tolerance==

===Schmalkaldic Wars===

Scandals and internal conflicts weakened the Protestants&#x27; position in Germany in the early 1540s. Philip the Magnanimous committed bigamy by secretly marrying a lady-in-waiting of his court although his wife was still alive. Bucer, Luther, and Melanchthon had discretely sanctioned the bigamious marriage allegedly to prevent adultery. In 1542, Philip and John the Constant&#x27;s successor, John Frederick I () invaded the Duchy of Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel which brought disapproval from other princes. Disputes over lands renewed the old rivalry between the Ernestine and Albertine branches of the Wettin dynasty of Saxony. Taking advantage of the situation, Emperor Charles built a broad coalition of Catholic and Evangelical princes against Hesse and Electoral Saxony. The coalition included the Albertine duke Maurice of Saxony (). During the ensuing Schmalkaldic War, Charles and his allies won a decisive victory, and Maurice was rewarded with John Frederick&#x27;s title of elector.

The triumphant regulated religious issues with an imperial edict known as the &quot;Augsburg Interim&quot;. The &quot;Interim&quot; sanctioned clerical marriage and the communion in both kinds in Protestant territories, but denied further concessions. Maurice issued an alternative regulation called the &quot;Leipzig Interim&quot; for Saxony which ordered the clergy to wear surplices. Melanchthon supported the &quot;Leipzig Interim&quot;, stating that such issues were &quot;matters indifferent&quot; but uncompromising Lutheran theologians such as Nicolaus von Amsdorf (d. 1565) and Matthias Flacius (d. 1575) rejected all concessions to imperial demands. Different views on justification and the Eucharist caused further heated debates between Melanchton&#x27;s followers, known as Philippists, and their opponents, called Gnesio-Lutherans (&#x27;authentic Lutherans&#x27;) in the 1550s. The &quot;Augsburg Interim&quot; was only implemented in the southern German Protestant cities. This led to the expulsion of recalcitrant clerics, including Bucer from Strasbourg. Alarmed by Charles&#x27;s triumph, Calvin and Bullinger agreed on a consensual Eucharistic formula, now known as (&#x27;Consensus of Zürich&#x27;), emphasising that Christ &quot;makes us participants of himself&quot; in the Lord&#x27;s Supper, but also stating that God &quot;uses the ministry of the sacraments&quot; without infusing divine power into them. Luther had died in 1546 but his followers rejected the &quot;Consensus&quot;. The rift between Evangelical and Reformed Protestants widened to the extent that Reformed refugees faced an unfriendly reception at Evangelical countries. In Bohemia, Hussite and Evangelical aristocrats and townspeople rose up against . Although Ferdinand crushed the revolt, he had to sanction religious plurality in Moravia as a reward for the Moravian Estates&#x27; loyalty during the Bohemian revolt.

Distrusting Emperor Charles, Maurice brokered a coalition of Evangelical princes, and promised four prince-bishoprics to King Henry II of France () for financial support. Maurice and his allies invaded the Habsburgs&#x27; domains, forcing Charles to flee. Signed on 10 August 1552, the Peace of Passau prescribed that the religious issues were to be discussed at the following Imperial Diet. The Diet was opened at Augsburg on 5 February 1555. Already exhausted, Charles appointed Ferdinand to represent him. Ferdinand&#x27;s negotiations with the Evangelical princes ended with the Peace of Augsburg on 25 September. The document reaffirmed the principle , but the Imperial Estates could only choose between Catholicism and the &quot;Augsburg Confession&quot;. Evangelical imperial free cities had to tolerate the existence of Catholic communities within their walls, and prince-bishoprics could not be secularised in case the bishop abandoned the Catholic faith. Charles, who did not sign the peace treaty, abdicated, ceding his imperial title to Ferdinand, and his vast empire to his son Philip II of Spain ().

===French Wars of Religion===


Many French Protestants did not risk to profess their faith in public. They were known as Nicodemites after Nicodemus, a Pharisee who visited Jesus in secret. Calvin condemned this practice describing those who attended the Mass as soldiers &quot;in the army of Antichrist&quot;. Under his influence, the French Protestants started to stay away from Catholic church services. They were called Huguenots for uncertain reason. The poet Clément Marot (d. 1544) provided them with popular stirring songs by translating forty-nine Psalms to French. promised to exterminate heresy in France in a peace treaty with in 1544. Next year, Waldensians were massacred in the Luberon region. In 1547, established a special court for heresy cases, named (&#x27;the burning chamber&#x27;). The lawyer Jean Crespin (d. 1572) completed a catalogue of martyrs to commemorate the victims of the purges, and it gained immense popularity in the Protestant communities all over Europe. After around 1555, prominent French aristocrats converted to Protestantism, including Marguerite of Angoulême&#x27;s daughter, Jeanne d&#x27;Albret, (d. 1572), Jeanne&#x27;s husband Antoine de Bourbon (d. 1562), and Gaspard II de Coligny (d. 1572), admiral of France. Their patronage encouraged less distinguished Huguenots to express their faith in public. In 1559, delegates from seventy-two congregations attended the first synod of the Reformed Church of France, representing about 1.5–2 million believers. The synod adopted the &quot;Gallican Confession&quot;, a confessional document drated by Calvin.

Fully preoccupied with a new war against Emperor Charles, did not take severe measures against the Huguenot nobility. After his sudden death after an accident, his eldest son Francis II () ascended the throne. His wife, Mary, Queen of Scots was the niece of Francis, Duke of Guise (d. 1563) and Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine (d. 1574), two leaders of the most resolute Catholic faction of the nobility. The queen mother Catherine de&#x27; Medici (d. 1589) distrusted them but the persecution of Huguenots intensified under their influence. When Francis died by an ear infection, Calvin considered his fate as divine deliverance. Francis was succeeded by his brother Charles IX () under Catherine&#x27;s regency. She enacted the Huguenots&#x27; right to freely attend church services and hold public assemblies because she wanted to avoid a civil war along religious lines.

Uncompromising Catholics and Huguenots considered their confrontation inevitable. The first of the French Wars of Religion—a series of armed conflicts between Catholics and Huguenots—began after Guise&#x27;s retainers massacred more than fifty Huguenots at Vassy on 1 March 1562. As Antoine de Bourbon had returned to Catholicism, his brother Louis I, Prince of Condé (d. 1569) assumed the leadership of a Huguenot revolt. They concluded a treaty with England in September 1562. To achieve a reconciliation, Catherine de&#x27;Medici married off her daughter Margaret of Valois (d. 1615) to the Protestant son of Jeanne d&#x27;Albret and Antoine de Bourbon, Henry de Bourbon, King of Navarre (). Mutual mistrust between Catholics and Huguenots, and the Parisians&#x27; determination to cleanse their city of heresy led to the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre after the wedding. On 24 August 1572, a fanatic mob slaughtered 2,000–3,000 Protestants in Paris, and by early October further 6,000–7,000 Huguenots fell victim to pogroms in other cities and towns. Many Huguenots returned to the Catholic Church or fled from France, and those who remained gathered in southern and southern-west France and continued the armed resistance. Known as &quot;Malcontents&quot;, moderate Catholics concluded that only concessions to the Huguenots could restore peace.

 died in May 1574 leaving an almost empty treasury to his brother Henry III (). Henry adopted a moderate religious policy but the uncompromising Catholics established the Catholic League in 1576. They entered into a secret alliance with of Spain to prevent the spread of Protestantism. In 1589, the monk Jacques Clément mortally wounded King Henry. He named Henry de Bourbon as his heir, but the League and many cities refused to obey to a Huguenot king. secured the support of moderate Catholics by converting to Catholicism. He defeated his French opponents and their Spanish allies, and put an end to the civil war early in 1598. He enacted many of the demands of the Huguenots, about fifteen per cent of the population, in the Edict of Nantes. Among others, they were allowed to attend religious services in many places, and their right to hold public offices was confirmed.

===Revolt in the Netherlands===

More Protestants fell victim to persecution in the seventeen provinces of Habsburg Netherlands than in any other country between 1523 and 1555. The ruthless persecution prevented the establishment of Evangelical congregations although Luther&#x27;s ideas were widely discussed in Flemish communities. Reformed theology spread among the Walloons through individuals&#x27; correspondence with Calvin and the Genevan academy from the 1540s. Nicodemism was not unusual but uncompromising Protestants disturbed Catholic ceremonies. The preacher Guido de Bres (d. 1567) established the first permanent Reformed congregations. He was a main contributor to the &quot;Belgic Confession&quot;, a confessional document based on the &quot;Gallican Confession&quot;, first published in Walloon in 1561, and in Dutch in 1562. The &quot;Confession&quot; sharply criticised the Anapabtists, and emphasized the importance of church discipline.

In 1566, requested governor Margaret of Parma (d. 1586) to moderate anti-heretic legislation. Although the petitioners were mocked as &quot;beggars&quot;, Margaret was open to a compromise. Protestant refugees returned from abroad, and religious enthusiasts stirred up public demonstrations. On the night of 20–21 August 1566, a Protestant mob sacked the Antwerp Cathedral, introducing a popular iconoclastic movement that spread all over the Netherlands. In 1567, Philip appointed Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba (d. 1582) to crush the riots. Alba arrived at the head of a 20,000-strong army, and introduced a reign of terror, leading to the execution of thousands of people. A prominent aristocrat William the Silent, Prince of Orange (d. 1584) assumed the leadership of the resistance. His &quot;Sea Beggars&quot;—a squadron of privateers—seized the provinces of Holland and Zeeland by 1572, although the Reformed communities were in the minority in most towns.

 government faced bankruptcy and his unpaid Spanish troops sacked Antwerp in 1576. This led to a general revolt against Spanish rule. The Catholic aristocrat Philippe III de Croÿ, Duke of Aarschot (d. 1595), made an alliance with William the Silent but rivalry between Catholics and Protestants did not abate. In 1581, the northern provinces united under William&#x27;s leadership, and renounced allegiance to Philip. In the south, Margaret of Parma&#x27;s son Alessandro Farnese crushed the revolts, forcing about 100,000 Protestants to seek refugee in the north. Developed from the union of seven northern provinces, the Dutch Republic remained under the loose leadership of the House of Orange. The Reformed pastors were eager to transform the whole society along their ideas. They failed because William preferred a more tolerant approach, and significant Protestant groups associated church discipline with Catholicism. As a consequence, Evangelical, Annabaptist and Catholic communities survived in the Dutch Republic. Heterodox theologies could also spread, such as the views of Jacobus Arminius (d. 1609) who argued that an individual could resist divine grace. Although Arminianism was rejected at the international Synod of Dort in 1619, it continued to influence Protestant theologians.

===Edict of Torda===

After King Louis&#x27;s death at Mohács, two claimants John Zápolya () and Ferdinand I of Habsburg () competed for the Hungarian throne. They were Catholic but neither of them risked to alienate potential supporters by anti-Protestant purges. The Transylvanian Saxon leader Markus Pemfflinger (d. 1537) promoted Evangelical preaching in the Saxon metropolis Hermanstadt (Sibiu, Romania) from around 1530. Evangelical teaching spread among ethnic Hungarians, Slovaks, and Croats after Protestant aristocrats started to appoint Evangelical preachers to the churches under their patronage in the 1530s. After Zápolya&#x27;s death, the Ottomans conquered central Hungary, his widow Isabella Jagiellon (d. 1559) assumed the regency for their infant son John Sigismund Zápolya () in eastern Hungary under Ottoman suzerainty, and Ferdinand ruled Royal Hungary in the north and west. Often in need of funds, Ferdinand seized church revenues, while Isabella and her treasurer the Catholic bishop George Martinuzzi (d. 1551) secularised the estates of the Transylvanian bishopric. The Transylvanian Saxons adopted the &quot;Augsburg Confession&quot; in 1544; five years later, five free royal boroughs accepted an Evangelical confession in Royal Hungary.

Two former Catholic priests Mátyás Dévai Bíró (d. 1547) and Mihály Sztárai (d. 1575) were among the first Hungarian pastors to teach Zwinglian Eucharistic theology. &quot;Sacramentarianism&quot; (the denial of Christ&#x27;s presence in the Eucharist) and rebaptism were outlawed by the Diet in Royal Hungary in 1548. John Sigismund was open to religious innovations. Under the influence of his court chaplain Ferenc Dávid (d. 1579), he adhered to Reformed theology from 1562, and accepted antitrinitarian views during the last years of his life. The Edict of Torda legalised three Protestant denominations—Evangelical, Reformed and Unitarian—in eastern Hungary in 1568. Eastern Hungary transformed into the autonomous Principality of Transylvania under Ottoman suzerainty in 1570. The coexistence of four officially recognised churches—Catholicism and the three legalised Protestant denominations—remained a lasting feature of religious politics in Transylvania. The most radical antitrinitarians rejected the New Testament and held Saturday (or Sabbath) as weekly holiday; hence they were called Sabbatarians.

===Warsaw Confederation===

As the Bohemian Brethren were famed for their diligence, many Polish aristocrats eagerly settled them on their estates. Ethnic Poles became receptive to Protestant ideas, especially to Calvin&#x27;s theology from the 1540s. The Jan Tarnowski (d. 1561) entered into correspondence with Calvin in 1540; in 1542, Jan Łaski (d. 1560) converted although his uncle (and namesake) had been the Primate of Poland. In 1548, Sigismund the Old&#x27;s tolerant son Sigismund II Augustus () ascended the throne. Two years later, the first synod of the Polish Reformed Church assembled at Pińczów. Proposals for the introduction of vernacular liturgy and communion in both kinds, and the abolition of clerical celibacy were forwarded by Sigismund Augustus to the Holy See but Pope Paul IV () rejected them. The Catholic prelates tried to put Protestant nobles and married priests on trial for heresy but the legislative assembly, or Sejm suspended such persecutions on the initiative of the Protestant Marshal of the Sejm Rafał Leszczyński and Tarnowski in 1552. In 1556, Łaski organised a synod in the hope of reuniting all non-Lutheran Protestants but failed. At the meeting, Piotr of Goniądz (d. 1573) openly attacked infant baptism and the doctrine of Trinity. The antitrinitarian Polish Brethren established their own church, known as Minor Church in contrast with the Reformed Major Church. From 1565, Polish nobles could no more be persecuted on religious grounds which allowed them to freely choose between competing theologies. By this time, around one-fifth of the nobility had converted to the Reformed faith, and most secular members of the Senate were Protestant. Relationship between Poland and Lithuania was redefined by the 1569 Union of Lublin which created the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. After Sigismund Augustus died, the Sejm passed the Warsaw Confederation prescribing that only candidates who promised to protect religious freedom could be elected king.

===Counter-Reformation and regional conflicts===

The continuous expansion of Protestantism stopped in Germany after the Peace of Augsburg. The Bavarian duke Albert V () took the lead of recatholicisation. He overcame the opposition of Evangelical nobles, and exiled all clerics who refused to take the Tridentine oath. With Albert&#x27;s support, the Jesuits opened a college in Ingolstadt that accepted Evangelical and Hussite students. eldest son and successor, Maximilian II () pursued a tolerant religious policy but his brothers, Ferdinand II of the Tyrol () and Charles II of Inner Austria () were determined to subdue their Protestant subjects. After the predominantly Evangelical Estates of Inner Austria who controlled taxation extracted concessions from , he promoted Catholicism by appointing Catholics to state offices even if he needed to hire Bavarian and Tyrolian nobles.

Interreligious conflicts led to wars in many regions of Central Europe. The Cologne War broke out after Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg, Archbishop-elector of Cologne (), abandoned Catholicism and married his Protestant lover Agnes von Mansfeld-Eisleben (d. 1637) in 1582. The war ended with the victory of his Catholic opponent Ernest (), a younger son of . The Strasbourg Bishops&#x27; War began when both the Catholic and Protestant canons of the Strasbourg Cathedral elected their own candidate to the see of Strasbourg in 1592. At the end, the Protestant candidate Johann Georg von Brandenburg (d. 1624) renounced in favor of his opponent Charles of Lorraine ().

 son and successor Ferdinand II () set up &quot;reformation commissions&quot;—a group of clerics and state officials led by a senior clergyman—to visit the Inner Austrian parishes between 1598 and 1601. The commissioners seized and destroyed Evangelical churches, burned Protestant books and expelled Evangelical priests, often with the support of the local (mainly Slovenian) peasantry. His cousin Emperor Rudolf II () introduced anti-Protestant measures in Royal Hungary and Transylvania, provoking a rebellion. The Ottomans supported the rebels whose leader, the Reformed aristocrat Stephen Bocskai was proclaimed prince of Transylvania (). Rudolph appointed his brother Matthias to conduct negotiations with Bocskai, and the peace treaty sanctioned the freedom of the Evangelical and Reformed Churches in Royal Hungary in 1606. Rudolph was forced to cede Hungary, Austria and Moravia to Matthias in 1608, and to confirm religious freedom in Bohemia in 1609.

== Reformation outside Germany ==
The Reformation also spread widely throughout Europe, starting with Bohemia, in the Czech lands, and, over the next few decades, to other countries.

=== Nordic countries ===

All of Scandinavia ultimately adopted Lutheranism over the course of the 16th century, as the monarchs of Denmark (who also ruled Norway and Iceland) and Sweden (who also ruled Finland) converted to that faith.

==== Iceland ====

Luther&#x27;s influence had already reached Iceland before King Christian&#x27;s decree. The Germans fished near Iceland&#x27;s coast, and the Hanseatic League engaged in commerce with the Icelanders. These Germans raised a Lutheran church in Hafnarfjörður as early as 1533. Through German trade connections, many young Icelanders studied in Hamburg. In 1538, when the kingly decree of the new Church ordinance reached Iceland, bishop Ögmundur and his clergy denounced it, threatening excommunication for anyone subscribing to the German &quot;heresy&quot;. In 1539, the King sent a new governor to Iceland, Klaus von Mervitz, with a mandate to introduce reform and take possession of church property. Von Mervitz seized a monastery in Viðey with the help of his sheriff, Dietrich of Minden, and his soldiers. They drove the monks out and seized all their possessions, for which they were promptly excommunicated by Ögmundur.

=== Great Britain ===
==== England ====

The English Reformation is a complex historical series of events and reversals, whose nature and effect has been debated by historians. The results of the reformation included an established church with a &quot;Prayer Book consciously aligned with Swiss theology...(but) the most elaborate liturgy of any Protestant Church in Europe&quot; practiced in Cathedrals, with plain, sermon-centred services in parish churches, politically imposed by a &quot;literate Protestant elite&quot;.

===== English North America =====

The most famous emigration to America was the migration of Puritan separatists from the Anglican Church of England. They fled first to Holland, and then later to America to establish the English colony of Massachusetts in New England, which later became one of the original United States. These Puritan separatists were also known as &quot;the Pilgrims&quot;. After establishing a colony at Plymouth (which became part of the colony of Massachusetts) in 1620, the Puritan pilgrims received a charter from the King of England that legitimised their colony, allowing them to do trade and commerce with merchants in England, in accordance with the principles of mercantilism. Civil and religious restrictions were most strictly applied by the Puritans of Massachusetts which saw various banishments applied to dissenters to enforce conformity, including the branding iron, the whipping post, the bilboes and the hangman&#x27;s noose. Notable individuals persecuted by the Puritans include Anne Hutchinson who was banished to Rhode Island during the Antinomian Controversy and Quaker Mary Dyer who was hanged in Boston for repeatedly defying a Puritan law banning Quakers from the colony. Dyer was one of the four executed Quakers known as the Boston martyrs. Executions ceased in 1661 when King Charles II explicitly forbade Massachusetts from executing anyone for professing Quakerism. In 1647, Massachusetts passed a law prohibiting any Jesuit Catholic priests from entering territory under Puritan jurisdiction. Any suspected person who could not clear himself was to be banished from the colony; a second offence carried a death penalty.

The Pilgrims held radical Protestant disapproval of Christmas, and its celebration was outlawed in Boston from 1659 to 1681. The ban was revoked in 1681 by the English-appointed governor Edmund Andros, who also revoked a Puritan ban on festivities on Saturday nights. Nevertheless, it was not until the mid-19th century that celebrating Christmas became fashionable in the Boston region.

==== Wales ====

Bishop Richard Davies and dissident Protestant cleric John Penry introduced Calvinist theology to Wales. In 1588, the Bishop of Llandaff published the entire Bible in the Welsh language. The translation had a significant impact upon the Welsh population and helped to firmly establish Protestantism among the Welsh people. The Welsh Protestants used the model of the Synod of Dort of 1618–1619. Calvinism developed through the Puritan period, following the restoration of the monarchy under Charles II, and within Wales&#x27; Calvinistic Methodist movement. However few copies of Calvin&#x27;s writings were available before the mid-19th century.

==== Scotland ====

The Reformation in Scotland&#x27;s case culminated ecclesiastically in the establishment of a church along reformed lines, and politically in the triumph of English influence over that of France. John Knox is regarded as the leader of the Scottish reformation.

The Reformation Parliament of 1560 repudiated the pope&#x27;s authority by the &quot;Papal Jurisdiction Act 1560&quot;, forbade the celebration of the Mass and approved a Protestant Confession of Faith. It was made possible by a revolution against French hegemony under the regime of the regent Mary of Guise, who had governed Scotland in the name of her absent daughter Mary, Queen of Scots (then also Queen of France).

Although Protestantism triumphed relatively easily in Scotland, the exact form of Protestantism remained to be determined. The 17th century saw a complex struggle between Presbyterianism (particularly the Covenanters) and Episcopalianism. The Presbyterians eventually won control of the Church of Scotland, which went on to have an important influence on Presbyterian churches worldwide, but Scotland retained a relatively large Episcopalian minority.

=== France ===
Catholicism remained the official state religion, and the fortunes of French Protestants gradually declined over the next century, culminating in Louis XIV&#x27;s Edict of Fontainebleau (1685), which revoked the Edict of Nantes and made Catholicism the sole legal religion of France, leading some Huguenots to live as Nicodemites. In response to the Edict of Fontainebleau, Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg declared the Edict of Potsdam (October 1685), giving free passage to Huguenot refugees and tax-free status to them for ten years.

In the late 17th century, 150,000–200,000 Huguenots fled to England, the Netherlands, Prussia, Switzerland, and the English and Dutch overseas colonies. A significant community in France remained in the Cévennes region. A separate Protestant community, of the Lutheran faith, existed in the newly conquered province of Alsace, its status not affected by the Edict of Fontainebleau.

=== Spain ===

In the early 16th century, Spain had a different political and cultural milieu from its Western and Central European neighbours in several respects, which affected the mentality and the reaction of the nation towards the Reformation. Spain, which had only recently managed to complete the reconquest of the Peninsula from the Moors in 1492, had been preoccupied with converting the Muslim and Jewish populations of the newly conquered regions through the establishment of the Spanish Inquisition in 1478. The rulers of the nation stressed political, cultural, and religious unity, and by the time of the Lutheran Reformation, the Spanish Inquisition was already 40 years old and had the capability of quickly persecuting any new movement that the leaders of the Catholic Church perceived or interpreted to be religious heterodoxy. Charles V did not wish to see Spain or the rest of Habsburg Europe divided, and in light of continual threat from the Ottomans, preferred to see the Catholic Church reform itself from within. This led to a Counter-Reformation in Spain in the 1530s. During the 1520s, the Spanish Inquisition had created an atmosphere of suspicion and sought to root out any religious thought seen as suspicious. As early as 1521, the Pope had written a letter to the Spanish monarchy warning against allowing the unrest in Northern Europe to be replicated in Spain. Between 1520 and 1550, printing presses in Spain were tightly controlled and any books of Protestant teaching were prohibited.

Between 1530 and 1540, Protestantism in Spain was still able to gain followers clandestinely, and in cities such as Seville and Valladolid adherents would secretly meet at private houses to pray and study the Bible. Protestants in Spain were estimated at between 1000 and 3000, mainly among intellectuals who had seen writings such as those of Erasmus. Notable reformers included Juan Gil and Juan Pérez de Pineda who subsequently fled and worked alongside others such as Francisco de Enzinas to translate the Greek New Testament into the Spanish language, a task completed by 1556. Protestant teachings were smuggled into Spain by Spaniards such as Julián Hernández, who in 1557 was condemned by the Inquisition and burnt at the stake. Under Philip II, conservatives in the Spanish church tightened their grip, and those who refused to recant such as Rodrigo de Valer were condemned to life imprisonment. On May 21, 1559, sixteen Spanish Lutherans were burnt at the stake; 14 were strangled before being burnt, while two were burnt alive. In October another 30 were executed. Spanish Protestants who were able to flee the country were to be found in at least a dozen cities in Europe, such as Geneva, where some of them embraced Calvinist teachings. Those who fled to England were given support by the Church of England.

The Kingdom of Navarre, although by the time of the Protestant Reformation a minor principality territoriality restricted to southern France, had French Huguenot monarchs, including Henry IV of France and his mother, Jeanne III of Navarre, a devout Calvinist.

Upon the arrival of the Protestant Reformation, Calvinism reached some Basques through the translation of the Bible into the Basque language by Joanes Leizarraga. As Queen of Navarre, Jeanne III commissioned the translation of the New Testament into Basque and Béarnese for the benefit of her subjects.

=== Italy ===

Word of the Protestant reformers reached Italy in the 1520s but never caught on. Its development was stopped by the Counter-Reformation, the Inquisition and popular disinterest. Not only was the Church highly aggressive in seeking out and suppressing heresy, but there was a shortage of Protestant leadership. No-one made a new Protestant translation of the Bible into Italian to compete with the existing Catholic vernacular translations; few tracts were written. No core of Protestantism emerged. The few preachers who did take an interest in &quot;Lutheranism&quot;, as it was called in Italy, were suppressed, or went into exile to northern countries where their message was well received. As a result, the Reformation exerted almost no lasting influence in Italy, except for strengthening the Catholic Church and pushing for an end to ongoing abuses during the Counter-Reformation.

Some Protestants left Italy and became outstanding activists of the European Reformation, mainly in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (e.g. Giorgio Biandrata, Bernardino Ochino, Giovanni Alciato, Giovanni Battista Cetis, Fausto Sozzini, Francesco Stancaro and Giovanni Valentino Gentile), who propagated Nontrinitarianism there and were chief instigators of the movement of Polish Brethren. Some also fled to England and Switzerland, including Peter Vermigli.

In 1532, the Waldensians, who had been already present centuries before the Reformation, aligned themselves and adopted the Calvinist theology. The Waldensian Church survived in the Western Alps through many persecutions and remains a Protestant church in Italy.

=== Slovenia ===

Primož Trubar is notable for consolidating the Slovene language and is considered to be the key figure of Slovenian cultural history, in many aspects a major Slovene historical personality. He was the key figure of the Protestant Church of the Slovene Lands, as he was its founder and its first superintendent. The first books in Slovene, &quot;Catechismus&quot; and &quot;Abecedarium&quot;, were written by Trubar.

=== Greece ===

The Protestant teachings of the Western Church were also briefly adopted within the Eastern Orthodox Church through the Greek Patriarch Cyril Lucaris in 1629 with the publishing of the &quot;Confessio&quot; (Calvinistic doctrine) in Geneva. Motivating factors in their decision to adopt aspects of the Reformation included the historical rivalry and mistrust between the Greek Orthodox and the Catholic Churches along with their concerns of Jesuit priests entering Greek lands in their attempts to propagate the teachings of the Counter-Reformation to the Greek populace. He subsequently sponsored Maximos of Gallipoli&#x27;s translation of the New Testament into the Modern Greek language and it was published in Geneva in 1638. Upon Lucaris&#x27;s death in 1638, the conservative factions within the Eastern Orthodox Church held two synods: the Synod of Constantinople (1638) and Synod of Iași (1642) criticising the reforms and, in the 1672 convocation led by Dositheos, they officially condemned the Calvinistic doctrines.

In 2019, Christos Yannaras told Norman Russell that although he had participated in the Zoë movement, he had come to regard it as Crypto-Protestant.

== Spread ==
The Reformation spread throughout Europe beginning in 1517, reaching its peak between 1545 and 1620. The greatest geographical extent of Protestantism occurred at some point between 1545 and 1620. In 1620, the Battle of White Mountain defeated Protestants in Bohemia (now the Czech Republic) who sought to have the 1609 Letter of Majesty upheld.
The Thirty Years&#x27; War began in 1618 and brought a drastic territorial and demographic decline when the House of Habsburg introduced counter-reformational measures throughout their vast possessions in Central Europe. Although the Thirty Years&#x27; War concluded with the Peace of Westphalia, the French Wars of the Counter-Reformation continued, as well as the expulsion of Protestants in Austria.

According to a 2020 study in the &quot;American Sociological Review&quot;, the Reformation spread earliest to areas where Luther had pre-existing social relations, such as mail correspondents, and former students, as well as where he had visited. The study argues that these social ties contributed more to the Reformation&#x27;s early breakthroughs than the printing press.

== Conclusion and legacy ==
There is no universal agreement on the exact or even the approximate date the Reformation ended. Various interpretations emphasise different dates, entire periods, or argue that the Reformation never really ended. However, there are a few popular interpretations. The Peace of Augsburg in 1555 officially ended the religious struggle between the two groups and made the legal division of Christianity permanent within the Holy Roman Empire, allowing rulers to choose either Lutheranism or Catholicism as the official confession of their state. It could be considered to end with the enactment of the confessions of faith. Other suggested ending years relate to the Counter-Reformation or the 1648 Peace of Westphalia. From one Catholic perspective, the Second Vatican Council ended the Counter-Reformation.
*In the history of theology or philosophy, the Reformation era ended with the Age of Orthodoxy. The Orthodox Period, also termed the , succeeded the Reformation with the 1545–63 Council of Trent, the 1562 Anglican &quot;Thirty-nine Articles&quot;, the 1580 &quot;Book of Concord&quot;, and other confessions of faith. The Orthodox Era ended with the development of both Pietism and the Enlightenment.
* The Peace of Westphalia might be considered to be the event that ended the Reformation.

=== Thirty Years&#x27; War: 1618–1648 ===
The Reformation and Counter-Reformation era conflicts are termed the European wars of religion. In particular, the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–48) devastated much of Germany, killing between 25 and 40% of its population. The Catholic House of Habsburg and its allies fought against the Protestant princes of Germany, supported at various times by Denmark, Sweden and France. The Habsburgs, who ruled Spain, Austria, the Crown of Bohemia, Hungary, Slovene Lands, the Spanish Netherlands and much of Germany and Italy, were staunch defenders of the Catholic Church.

Two main tenets of the Peace of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years&#x27; War, were:
* All parties would now recognise the Peace of Augsburg of 1555, by which each prince would have the right to determine the religion of his own state, the options being Catholicism, Lutheranism, and now Calvinism (the principle of ).
* Christians living in principalities where their denomination was &quot;not&quot; the established church were guaranteed the right to practice their faith in public during allotted hours and in private at their will.

The treaty also effectively ended the Papacy&#x27;s pan-European political power. Pope Innocent X declared the treaty &quot;null, void, invalid, iniquitous, unjust, damnable, reprobate, inane, empty of meaning and effect for all times&quot; in his apostolic brief &quot;Zelo Domus Dei&quot;. European sovereigns, Catholic and Protestant alike, ignored his verdict.

=== Consequences of the Reformation ===
In nations that remained Catholic, or reverted to it, remaining Protestants sometimes lived as crypto-Protestants, also called Nicodemites, contrary to the urging of John Calvin, who wanted them to live their faith openly. Some crypto-Protestants have been identified as late as the 19th century after immigrating to Latin America. 

In Britain from the Elizabethan period, dissenters called Recusants included both Catholic families and English Dissenters (Quakers, Ranters, Diggers, Grindletonians, etc.): almost the entire Irish population were recusants from the imposed Protestant Church of Ireland.

Travel and migration between countries became more difficult. &quot;In 1500, a Christian could travel from one end of Europe to another without fear of persecution; by 1600, every form of Christianity was illegal somewhere in Europe.&quot; Two prolonged series of conflicts, the French Wars of Religion (1562–1598) and the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) resulted in between six and sixteen million deaths.

=== Radical Reformation ===
In parts of Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, a majority sympathised with the Radical Reformation despite intense persecution. Although the surviving proportion of the European population that rebelled against Catholic, Lutheran and Zwinglian churches was small, Radical Reformers wrote profusely and the literature on the Radical Reformation is disproportionately large, partly as a result of the proliferation of the Radical Reformation teachings in the United States.

Despite significant diversity among the early Radical Reformers, some &quot;repeating patterns&quot; emerged among many Anabaptist groups. Many of these patterns were enshrined in the &quot;Schleitheim Confession&quot; (1527) and include believers&#x27; (or adult) baptism, memorial view of the Lord&#x27;s Supper, belief that Scripture is the final authority on matters of faith and practice, emphasis on the New Testament and the Sermon on the Mount, interpretation of Scripture in community, separation from the world and a two-kingdom theology, pacifism and nonresistance, communal ownership and economic sharing, belief in the freedom of the will, non-swearing of oaths, &quot;yieldedness&quot; (&quot;Gelassenheit&quot;) to one&#x27;s community and to God, the ban (i.e., shunning), salvation through divinization (&quot;Vergöttung&quot;) and ethical living, and discipleship (&quot;Nachfolge Christi&quot;).

=== Literacy ===
The Protestant Reformation was a triumph of literacy and the new printing press. Luther&#x27;s translation of the Bible into High German (the New Testament was published in 1522; the Old Testament was published in parts and completed in 1534) was also decisive for the German language and its evolution from Early New High German to Modern Standard German. Luther&#x27;s translation of the Bible promoted the development of non-local forms of language and exposed all speakers to forms of German from outside their own area. The publication of Luther&#x27;s Bible was a decisive moment in the spread of literacy in early modern Germany, and stimulated as well the printing and distribution of religious books and pamphlets. From 1517 onward, religious pamphlets flooded Germany and much of Europe.

By 1530, over 10,000 publications are known, with a total of ten million copies. The Reformation was thus a media revolution. Luther strengthened his attacks on Rome by depicting a &quot;good&quot; against &quot;bad&quot; church. From there, it became clear that print could be used for propaganda in the Reformation for particular agendas, although the term propaganda derives from the Catholic &quot;Congregatio de Propaganda Fide&quot; (&quot;Congregation for Propagating the Faith&quot;) from the Counter-Reformation. Reform writers used existing styles, cliches and stereotypes which they adapted as needed. Especially effective were writings in German, including Luther&#x27;s translation of the Bible, his Smaller Catechism for parents teaching their children, and his Larger Catechism, for pastors.

Illustrations in the German Bible and in many tracts popularised Luther&#x27;s ideas. Lucas Cranach the Elder (1472–1553), the great painter patronised by the electors of Wittenberg, was a close friend of Luther, and he illustrated Luther&#x27;s theology for a popular audience. He dramatised Luther&#x27;s views on the relationship between the Old and New Testaments, while remaining mindful of Luther&#x27;s careful distinctions about proper and improper uses of visual imagery.

===Outcomes===
Protestants have to some extent developed their own culture, with major contributions in education, the humanities and sciences, the political and social order, the economy and the arts and many other fields. Various outcomes of the Reformation have been suggested by scholars: improved human capital formation, the disputed Protestant work ethic, improved economic development, the modern state, and &quot;dark&quot; outcomes:

==== Human capital formation ====
Claims include:
* Higher literacy rates, 
* Lower gender gap in school enrollment and literacy rates.
* Higher primary school enrollment.
* Higher public spending on schooling and better educational performance of military conscripts.
* Higher capability in reading, numeracy, essay writing, and history.

==== Protestant ethic ====

Claims include:
* More hours worked.
* Divergent stated attitudes about the absolute priority of work between Protestants and Catholics.
* Fewer referendums on leisure, state intervention, and redistribution in Swiss cantons with more Protestants.
* Lower life satisfaction when unemployed.
* Pro-market attitudes.
* Higher relative income growth in Protestant cities compared to Catholic cities (correlated with larger growth in Protestant city size.)

==== Economic development ====

Claims include:
* Different levels of income tax revenue per capita, % of labor force in manufacturing and services, and incomes of male elementary school teachers.
* Growth of Protestant cities.
* Greater entrepreneurship among religious minorities in Protestant states.
* Different social ethics facilitating impersonal trade.
*Industrialization.

==== Modern states ====
Claims include:
* The Reformation has been credited as a key factor in the development of the state system.
* The Reformation has been credited as a key factor in the formation of transnational advocacy movements.
* The Reformation impacted the Western legal tradition.
* Enabling professional bureaucracies to emerge in Europe.
* Establishment of state churches.
* Poor relief and social welfare regimes.
* James Madison noted that Martin Luther&#x27;s doctrine of the two kingdoms marked the beginning of the modern conception of separation of church and state.
* The Calvinist and Lutheran doctrine of the lesser magistrate contributed to resistance theory in the Early Modern period and was employed in the United States Declaration of Independence.
* Reformers such as Calvin promoted mixed government and the separation of powers, which governments such as the United States subsequently adopted.

====World demographics====

Today, classical Protestantism (including Anglicans) has between 300 and 625 million worldwide adherents, up to one quarter of all Christians.

And general Protestantism—broadly defined to also include Evangelical, Pentecostal, non-conformist and non-denominationalists—constitutes the second-largest form of Christianity (after Catholicism), with between 850,000 and 1.17 billion adherents worldwide (between 40% and 45% of all Christians) divided into an estimated 45,000 denominations.

==== Other outcomes ====
Other claims include:
* Witch trials became more common in regions or other jurisdictions where Protestants and Catholics contested the religious market.
* Christopher J. Probst, in his book &quot;Demonizing the Jews: Luther and the Protestant Church in Nazi Germany&quot; (2012), shows that a large number of German Protestant clergy and theologians during the Nazi Third Reich used Luther&#x27;s hostile publications towards the Jews and Judaism to justify at least in part the anti-Semitic policies of the National Socialists.
* In its decree on ecumenism, the Second Vatican Council of Catholic bishops declared that by contemporary dialogue that, while still holding views as the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church, between the churches &quot;all are led to examine their own faithfulness to Christ&#x27;s will for the Church and accordingly to undertake with vigor the task of renewal and reform&quot; (&quot;Unitatis Redintegratio&quot;, 4).
* Beer production switched from using herbs to hops.

=== Historiography ===
Margaret C. Jacob argues that there has been a dramatic shift in the historiography of the Reformation. Until the 1960s, historians focused their attention largely on the great leaders and theologians of the 16th century, especially Luther, Calvin, and Zwingli. Their ideas were studied in depth. However, the rise of the new social history in the 1960s led to looking at history from the bottom up, not from the top down. Historians began to concentrate on the values, beliefs and behavior of the people at large. She finds, &quot;in contemporary scholarship, the Reformation is now seen as a vast cultural upheaval, a social and popular movement, textured and rich because of its diversity.&quot;

For example, historian John Bossy characterized the Reformation as a period where Christianity was re-cast not as &quot;a community sustained by ritual acts, but as a teaching enforced by institutional structures,&quot; for Catholics as well as Protestants; and sin was re-cast from the seven deadly sins —wrong because antisocial— to transgressions of the Ten Commandments —wrong as affronts to God.

Partly due to Martin Luther&#x27;s love for music, music became important in Lutheranism. The study and practice of music was encouraged in Protestant majority countries. Songs such as the Lutheran hymns or the Calvinist Psalter became tools for the spread of Protestant ideas and beliefs, as well as identity flags. Similar attitudes developed among Catholics, who in turn encouraged the creation and use of music for religious purposes.

<text>The Butler Act was a 1925 Tennessee law prohibiting public school teachers from denying the book of Genesis account of mankind&#x27;s origin. The law also prevented the teaching of the evolution of man from what it referred to as lower orders of animals in place of the Biblical account. The law was introduced by Tennessee House of Representatives member John Washington Butler, from whom the law got its name. It was enacted as Tennessee Code Annotated Title 49 (Education) Section 1922, having been signed into law by Tennessee governor Austin Peay.

The law was challenged later that year in a famous trial in Dayton, Tennessee called the Scopes Trial which included a raucous confrontation between prosecution attorney and fundamentalist religious leader, William Jennings Bryan, and noted defense attorney and religious agnostic, Clarence Darrow.
It was repealed in 1967.

==Provisions of the law==

The law, &quot;An act prohibiting the teaching of the Evolution Theory in all the Universities, and all other public schools of Tennessee, which are supported in whole or in part by the public school funds of the State, and to provide penalties for the violations thereof&quot; (Tenn. HB 185, 1925) specifically provided:
:That it shall be unlawful for any teacher in any of the Universities, Normals and all other public schools of the State which are supported in whole or in part by the public school funds of the State, to teach any theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.

It additionally outlined that an offending teacher would be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined between $100 and $500 for each offense.

By the terms of the statute, it could be argued, it was not illegal to teach evolution in respect to non-human creatures, such as that apes descended from protozoa or to teach the mechanisms of variation and natural selection. The bill also did not touch on, or restrict the teaching of prevailing scientific theories of geology or the age of the Earth. It did not even require that the Genesis story be taught, but prohibited solely the teaching that man evolved, or any other theory denying that man was created by God as recorded in Genesis. However the author of the law, a Tennessee farmer and member of the Tennessee House of Representatives John Washington Butler, specifically intended that it would prohibit the teaching of evolution. He later was reported to have said &quot;No, I didn&#x27;t know anything about evolution when I introduced it. I&#x27;d read in the papers that boys and girls were coming home from school and telling their fathers and mothers that the Bible was all nonsense.&quot; After reading copies of William Jennings Bryan&#x27;s lecture &quot;Is the Bible True?&quot; as well as Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;The Origin of Species&quot; and &quot;The Descent of Man&quot;, Butler decided the teaching of evolution was dangerous.

==Challenges==

The law was challenged by the ACLU in the famed Scopes Trial, in which John Scopes, a high school science teacher who agreed to be paid on a charge of having taught evolution, and was nominally served a warrant on May 5, 1925. Scopes was indicted on May 25 and ultimately convicted; on appeal the Tennessee Supreme Court found the law to be constitutional under the Tennessee State Constitution, because:

We are not able to see how the prohibition of teaching the theory that man has descended from a lower order of animals gives preference to any religious establishment or mode of worship. So far as we know, there is no religious establishment or organized body that has in its creed or confession of faith any article denying or affirming such a theory. — Scopes v. State 289 S.W. 363, 367 (Tenn. 1927)

Despite this decision, the Tennessee Supreme Court reversed the conviction on a technicality (that the jury should have fixed the amount of the fine), and the case was not retried. During the trial, Butler told reporters: &quot;I never had any idea my bill would make a fuss. I just thought it would become a law, and that everybody would abide by it and that we wouldn&#x27;t hear any more of evolution in Tennessee.&quot;

The law remained on the books until 1967, when teacher Gary L. Scott of Jacksboro, Tennessee, who had been dismissed for violation of the act, sued for reinstatement, citing his First Amendment right to free speech. Although his termination was rescinded, Scott continued his fight with a class action lawsuit in the Nashville Federal District Court, seeking a permanent injunction against enforcement of that law. Within three days of his filing suit, a bill for repeal of the Butler Act had passed both houses of the Tennessee legislature and was signed into law May 18 by Governor Buford Ellington.

<text>The Ante-Nicene Fathers: The Writings of the Fathers Down to A.D. 325 (abbreviated ANF) is a collection of books in 10 volumes (one volume is indexes) containing English translations of the majority of Early Christian writings. The period covers the beginning of Christianity until the promulgation of the Nicene Creed at the First Council of Nicaea.

==Publication==

The series was originally published between 1867 and 1873 by the Presbyterian publishing house T. &amp; T. Clark in Edinburgh under the title &quot;Ante-Nicene Christian Library&quot; (ANCL), as a response to the Oxford movement&#x27;s &quot;Library of the Fathers&quot; which was perceived as too strongly identified with the Anglo-Catholic movement. The volumes were edited by Rev. Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson. This series was available by subscription, but the editors were unable to interest enough subscribers to commission a translation of the homilies of Origen.

In 1885 the Christian Literature Company, first of Buffalo, then New York, began to issue the volumes in a reorganized form. This was done without permission, and was indeed a pirate edition. The new series was edited by the Episcopal bishop of New York, A. Cleveland Coxe. Coxe gave his series the title &quot;The Ante-Nicene Fathers&quot;. By 1896, this American edition/revision was complete. Unable to close down the pirate, T. &amp; T. Clark were obliged to make what terms they could.

In 1897, a volume 9, which contained new translations, was published by T. &amp; T. Clark as an additional volume, to complete the original ANCL. Apart from volume 9, the contents entirely derived from the ANCL, but in a more chronological order. Coxe added his own introductions and notes, which were criticized by academic authorities and Roman Catholic reviewers. 

T. &amp; T. Clark then associated with the Christian Literature Company and with other American publishers for the publication of the &quot;Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers&quot;.

<doc id="37864" wikidata="Q679800" url="?curid=37864" title="Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem">
<text>The Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem is an essential principle for digital signal processing linking the frequency range of a signal and the sample rate required to avoid a type of distortion called aliasing. The theorem states that the sample rate must be at least twice the bandwidth of the signal to avoid aliasing. In practice, it is used to select band-limiting filters to keep aliasing below an acceptable amount when an analog signal is sampled or when sample rates are changed within a digital signal processing function.

The Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem is a theorem in the field of signal processing which serves as a fundamental bridge between continuous-time signals and discrete-time signals. It establishes a sufficient condition for a sample rate that permits a discrete sequence of &quot;samples&quot; to capture all the information from a continuous-time signal of finite bandwidth.

Strictly speaking, the theorem only applies to a class of mathematical functions having a Fourier transform that is zero outside of a finite region of frequencies. Intuitively we expect that when one reduces a continuous function to a discrete sequence and interpolates back to a continuous function, the fidelity of the result depends on the density (or sample rate) of the original samples. The sampling theorem introduces the concept of a sample rate that is sufficient for perfect fidelity for the class of functions that are band-limited to a given bandwidth, such that no actual information is lost in the sampling process. It expresses the sufficient sample rate in terms of the bandwidth for the class of functions. The theorem also leads to a formula for perfectly reconstructing the original continuous-time function from the samples.

Perfect reconstruction may still be possible when the sample-rate criterion is not satisfied, provided other constraints on the signal are known (see below and compressed sensing). In some cases (when the sample-rate criterion is not satisfied), utilizing additional constraints allows for approximate reconstructions. The fidelity of these reconstructions can be verified and quantified utilizing Bochner&#x27;s theorem.

The name &quot;Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem&quot; honours Harry Nyquist and Claude Shannon, but the theorem was also previously discovered by E. T. Whittaker (published in 1915), and Shannon cited Whittaker&#x27;s paper in his work. The theorem is thus also known by the names &quot;Whittaker–Shannon sampling theorem&quot;, &quot;Whittaker–Shannon&quot;, and &quot;Whittaker–Nyquist–Shannon&quot;, and may also be referred to as the &quot;cardinal theorem of interpolation&quot;.

==Introduction==
Sampling is a process of converting a signal (for example, a function of continuous time or space) into a sequence of values (a function of discrete time or space). Shannon&#x27;s version of the theorem states:

A sufficient sample-rate is therefore anything larger than formula_1 samples per second. Equivalently, for a given sample rate formula_2, perfect reconstruction is guaranteed possible for a bandlimit formula_3.

When the bandlimit is too high (or there is no bandlimit), the reconstruction exhibits imperfections known as aliasing. Modern statements of the theorem are sometimes careful to explicitly state that formula_4 must contain no sinusoidal component at exactly frequency formula_5 or that formula_6 must be strictly less than one half the sample rate. The threshold formula_1 is called the Nyquist rate and is an attribute of the continuous-time input formula_4 to be sampled. The sample rate must exceed the Nyquist rate for the samples to suffice to represent formula_9 The threshold formula_10 is called the Nyquist frequency and is an attribute of the sampling equipment. All meaningful frequency components of the properly sampled formula_4 exist below the Nyquist frequency. The condition described by these inequalities is called the &quot;Nyquist criterion&quot;, or sometimes the &quot;Raabe condition&quot;. The theorem is also applicable to functions of other domains, such as space, in the case of a digitized image. The only change, in the case of other domains, is the units of measure attributed to formula_12 formula_13 and formula_14

The symbol formula_15 is customarily used to represent the interval between adjacent samples and is called the &quot;sample period&quot; or &quot;sampling interval&quot;. The samples of function formula_4 are commonly denoted by formula_17 (alternatively formula_18 in older signal processing literature), for all integer values of formula_19 The multiplier formula_20 is a result of the transition from continuous time to discrete time (see Discrete-time Fourier transform#Relation to Fourier Transform), and it is needed to preserve the energy of the signal as formula_20 varies.

A mathematically ideal way to interpolate the sequence involves the use of sinc functions. Each sample in the sequence is replaced by a sinc function, centered on the time axis at the original location of the sample formula_22 with the amplitude of the sinc function scaled to the sample value, formula_23 Subsequently, the sinc functions are summed into a continuous function. A mathematically equivalent method uses the Dirac comb and proceeds by convolving one sinc function with a series of Dirac delta pulses, weighted by the sample values. Neither method is numerically practical. Instead, some type of approximation of the sinc functions, finite in length, is used. The imperfections attributable to the approximation are known as &quot;interpolation error&quot;.

Practical digital-to-analog converters produce neither scaled and delayed sinc functions, nor ideal Dirac pulses. Instead they produce a piecewise-constant sequence of scaled and delayed rectangular pulses (the zero-order hold), usually followed by a lowpass filter (called an &quot;anti-imaging filter&quot;) to remove spurious high-frequency replicas (images) of the original baseband signal.

==Aliasing==

When formula_4 is a function with a Fourier transform formula_25:

:formula_26

Then the samples formula_27 of formula_4 are sufficient to create a periodic summation of formula_29 (see Discrete-time Fourier transform#Relation to Fourier Transform):

which is a periodic function and its equivalent representation as a Fourier series, whose coefficients are formula_27. This function is also known as the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) of the sample sequence.

As depicted, copies of formula_25 are shifted by multiples of the sampling rate formula_32 and combined by addition. For a band-limited function formula_33 and sufficiently large formula_13 it is possible for the copies to remain distinct from each other. But if the Nyquist criterion is not satisfied, adjacent copies overlap, and it is not possible in general to discern an unambiguous formula_29 Any frequency component above formula_10 is indistinguishable from a lower-frequency component, called an &quot;alias&quot;, associated with one of the copies. In such cases, the customary interpolation techniques produce the alias, rather than the original component. When the sample-rate is pre-determined by other considerations (such as an industry standard), formula_4 is usually filtered to reduce its high frequencies to acceptable levels before it is sampled. The type of filter required is a lowpass filter, and in this application it is called an anti-aliasing filter.


==Derivation as a special case of Poisson summation==
When there is no overlap of the copies (also known as &quot;images&quot;) of formula_25, the formula_39 term of can be recovered by the product:

formula_40

where:

formula_41

The sampling theorem is proved since formula_25 uniquely determines formula_4.

All that remains is to derive the formula for reconstruction. formula_44 need not be precisely defined in the region formula_45 because formula_46 is zero in that region. However, the worst case is when formula_47 the Nyquist frequency. A function that is sufficient for that and all less severe cases is:

formula_48

where formula_49 is the rectangular function. Therefore:

:formula_50
:::formula_51      (from  , above).
:::formula_52     

The inverse transform of both sides produces the Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula:

:formula_53

which shows how the samples, formula_54, can be combined to reconstruct formula_4.

* Larger-than-necessary values of formula_2 (smaller values of formula_20), called &quot;oversampling&quot;, have no effect on the outcome of the reconstruction and have the benefit of leaving room for a &quot;transition band&quot; in which formula_44 is free to take intermediate values. Undersampling, which causes aliasing, is not in general a reversible operation.
* Theoretically, the interpolation formula can be implemented as a low-pass filter, whose impulse response is formula_59 and whose input is formula_60 which is a Dirac comb function modulated by the signal samples. Practical digital-to-analog converters (DAC) implement an approximation like the zero-order hold. In that case, oversampling can reduce the approximation error.

==Shannon&#x27;s original proof==
Poisson shows that the Fourier series in produces the periodic summation of formula_25, regardless of formula_2 and formula_6. Shannon, however, only derives the series coefficients for the case formula_64. Virtually quoting Shannon&#x27;s original paper:

:Let formula_65 be the spectrum of formula_9  Then

::formula_67

:because formula_65 is assumed to be zero outside the band formula_69  If we let formula_70 where formula_71 is any positive or negative integer, we obtain:
}}

:On the left are values of formula_4 at the sampling points. The integral on the right will be recognized as essentially the formula_73 coefficient in a Fourier-series expansion of the function formula_74 taking the interval formula_75 to formula_6 as a fundamental period. This means that the values of the samples formula_77 determine the Fourier coefficients in the series expansion of formula_78  Thus they determine formula_74 since formula_65 is zero for frequencies greater than formula_5 and for lower frequencies formula_65 is determined if its Fourier coefficients are determined. But formula_65 determines the original function formula_4 completely, since a function is determined if its spectrum is known. Therefore the original samples determine the function formula_4 completely.

Shannon&#x27;s proof of the theorem is complete at that point, but he goes on to discuss reconstruction via sinc functions, what we now call the Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula as discussed above. He does not derive or prove the properties of the sinc function, as the Fourier pair relationship between the rect (the rectangular function) and sinc functions was well known by that time.

As in the other proof, the existence of the Fourier transform of the original signal is assumed, so the proof does not say whether the sampling theorem extends to bandlimited stationary random processes.

===Notes===

==Application to multivariable signals and images==


The sampling theorem is usually formulated for functions of a single variable. Consequently, the theorem is directly applicable to time-dependent signals and is normally formulated in that context. However, the sampling theorem can be extended in a straightforward way to functions of arbitrarily many variables. Grayscale images, for example, are often represented as two-dimensional arrays (or matrices) of real numbers representing the relative intensities of pixels (picture elements) located at the intersections of row and column sample locations. As a result, images require two independent variables, or indices, to specify each pixel uniquely—one for the row, and one for the column.

Color images typically consist of a composite of three separate grayscale images, one to represent each of the three primary colors—red, green, and blue, or &quot;RGB&quot; for short. Other colorspaces using 3-vectors for colors include HSV, CIELAB, XYZ, etc. Some colorspaces such as cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (CMYK) may represent color by four dimensions. All of these are treated as vector-valued functions over a two-dimensional sampled domain.

Similar to one-dimensional discrete-time signals, images can also suffer from aliasing if the sampling resolution, or pixel density, is inadequate. For example, a digital photograph of a striped shirt with high frequencies (in other words, the distance between the stripes is small), can cause aliasing of the shirt when it is sampled by the camera&#x27;s image sensor. The aliasing appears as a moiré pattern. The &quot;solution&quot; to higher sampling in the spatial domain for this case would be to move closer to the shirt, use a higher resolution sensor, or to optically blur the image before acquiring it with the sensor using an optical low-pass filter.

Another example is shown here in the brick patterns. The top image shows the effects when the sampling theorem&#x27;s condition is not satisfied. When software rescales an image (the same process that creates the thumbnail shown in the lower image) it, in effect, runs the image through a low-pass filter first and then downsamples the image to result in a smaller image that does not exhibit the moiré pattern. The top image is what happens when the image is downsampled without low-pass filtering: aliasing results.

The sampling theorem applies to camera systems, where the scene and lens constitute an analog spatial signal source, and the image sensor is a spatial sampling device. Each of these components is characterized by a modulation transfer function (MTF), representing the precise resolution (spatial bandwidth) available in that component. Effects of aliasing or blurring can occur when the lens MTF and sensor MTF are mismatched. When the optical image which is sampled by the sensor device contains higher spatial frequencies than the sensor, the under sampling acts as a low-pass filter to reduce or eliminate aliasing. When the area of the sampling spot (the size of the pixel sensor) is not large enough to provide sufficient spatial anti-aliasing, a separate anti-aliasing filter (optical low-pass filter) may be included in a camera system to reduce the MTF of the optical image. Instead of requiring an optical filter, the graphics processing unit of smartphone cameras performs digital signal processing to remove aliasing with a digital filter. Digital filters also apply sharpening to amplify the contrast from the lens at high spatial frequencies, which otherwise falls off rapidly at diffraction limits.

The sampling theorem also applies to post-processing digital images, such as to up or down sampling. Effects of aliasing, blurring, and sharpening may be adjusted with digital filtering implemented in software, which necessarily follows the theoretical principles.

==Critical frequency==
To illustrate the necessity of formula_86 consider the family of sinusoids generated by different values of formula_87 in this formula:

:formula_88

With formula_64 or equivalently formula_90 the samples are given by:

:formula_91

 That sort of ambiguity is the reason for the &quot;strict&quot; inequality of the sampling theorem&#x27;s condition.

==Sampling of non-baseband signals==
As discussed by Shannon:

That is, a sufficient no-loss condition for sampling signals that do not have baseband components exists that involves the &quot;width&quot; of the non-zero frequency interval as opposed to its highest frequency component. See &quot;sampling&quot; for more details and examples.

For example, in order to sample FM radio signals in the frequency range of 100–102 MHz, it is not necessary to sample at 204 MHz (twice the upper frequency), but rather it is sufficient to sample at 4 MHz (twice the width of the frequency interval).

A bandpass condition is that formula_92 for all nonnegative formula_93 outside the open band of frequencies:
:formula_94
for some nonnegative integer formula_95. This formulation includes the normal baseband condition as the case formula_96

The corresponding interpolation function is the impulse response of an ideal brick-wall bandpass filter (as opposed to the ideal brick-wall lowpass filter used above) with cutoffs at the upper and lower edges of the specified band, which is the difference between a pair of lowpass impulse responses:

formula_97

Other generalizations, for example to signals occupying multiple non-contiguous bands, are possible as well. Even the most generalized form of the sampling theorem does not have a provably true converse. That is, one cannot conclude that information is necessarily lost just because the conditions of the sampling theorem are not satisfied; from an engineering perspective, however, it is generally safe to assume that if the sampling theorem is not satisfied then information will most likely be lost.

==Nonuniform sampling==
The sampling theory of Shannon can be generalized for the case of nonuniform sampling, that is, samples not taken equally spaced in time. The Shannon sampling theory for non-uniform sampling states that a band-limited signal can be perfectly reconstructed from its samples if the average sampling rate satisfies the Nyquist condition. Therefore, although uniformly spaced samples may result in easier reconstruction algorithms, it is not a necessary condition for perfect reconstruction.

The general theory for non-baseband and nonuniform samples was developed in 1967 by Henry Landau. He proved that the average sampling rate (uniform or otherwise) must be twice the &quot;occupied&quot; bandwidth of the signal, assuming it is &quot;a priori&quot; known what portion of the spectrum was occupied.

In the late 1990s, this work was partially extended to cover signals for which the amount of occupied bandwidth is known but the actual occupied portion of the spectrum is unknown. In the 2000s, a complete theory was developed
(see the section Sampling below the Nyquist rate under additional restrictions below) using compressed sensing. In particular, the theory, using signal processing language, is described in a 2009 paper by Mishali and Eldar. They show, among other things, that if the frequency locations are unknown, then it is necessary to sample at least at twice the Nyquist criteria; in other words, you must pay at least a factor of 2 for not knowing the location of the spectrum. Note that minimum sampling requirements do not necessarily guarantee stability.

==Sampling below the Nyquist rate under additional restrictions==

The Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem provides a sufficient condition for the sampling and reconstruction of a band-limited signal. When reconstruction is done via the Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula, the Nyquist criterion is also a necessary condition to avoid aliasing, in the sense that if samples are taken at a slower rate than twice the band limit, then there are some signals that will not be correctly reconstructed. However, if further restrictions are imposed on the signal, then the Nyquist criterion may no longer be a necessary condition.

A non-trivial example of exploiting extra assumptions about the signal is given by the recent field of compressed sensing, which allows for full reconstruction with a sub-Nyquist sampling rate. Specifically, this applies to signals that are sparse (or compressible) in some domain. As an example, compressed sensing deals with signals that may have a low overall bandwidth (say, the &quot;effective&quot; bandwidth formula_98) but the frequency locations are unknown, rather than all together in a single band, so that the passband technique does not apply. In other words, the frequency spectrum is sparse. Traditionally, the necessary sampling rate is thus formula_99 Using compressed sensing techniques, the signal could be perfectly reconstructed if it is sampled at a rate slightly lower than formula_100 With this approach, reconstruction is no longer given by a formula, but instead by the solution to a linear optimization program.

Another example where sub-Nyquist sampling is optimal arises under the additional constraint that the samples are quantized in an optimal manner, as in a combined system of sampling and optimal lossy compression. This setting is relevant in cases where the joint effect of sampling and quantization is to be considered, and can provide a lower bound for the minimal reconstruction error that can be attained in sampling and quantizing a random signal. For stationary Gaussian random signals, this lower bound is usually attained at a sub-Nyquist sampling rate, indicating that sub-Nyquist sampling is optimal for this signal model under optimal quantization.

==Historical background==
The sampling theorem was implied by the work of Harry Nyquist in 1928, in which he showed that up to formula_1 independent pulse samples could be sent through a system of bandwidth formula_6; but he did not explicitly consider the problem of sampling and reconstruction of continuous signals. About the same time, Karl Küpfmüller showed a similar result and discussed the sinc-function impulse response of a band-limiting filter, via its integral, the step-response sine integral; this bandlimiting and reconstruction filter that is so central to the sampling theorem is sometimes referred to as a &quot;Küpfmüller filter&quot; (but seldom so in English).

The sampling theorem, essentially a dual of Nyquist&#x27;s result, was proved by Claude E. Shannon. The mathematician E. T. Whittaker published similar results in 1915, J. M. Whittaker in 1935, and Gabor in 1946 (&quot;Theory of communication&quot;).

In 1948 and 1949, Claude E. Shannon published the two revolutionary articles in which he founded information theory. In Shannon&#x27;s &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Communication&quot;, the sampling theorem is formulated as &quot;Theorem 13&quot;: Let formula_103 contain no frequencies over W. Then

formula_104
where formula_105

It was not until these articles were published that the theorem known as &quot;Shannon&#x27;s sampling theorem&quot; became common property among communication engineers, although Shannon himself writes that this is a fact which is common knowledge in the communication art. A few lines further on, however, he adds: &quot;but in spite of its evident importance, [it] seems not to have appeared explicitly in the literature of communication theory&quot;. Despite his sampling theorem being published at the end of the 1940s, Shannon had derived his sampling theorem as early as 1940.

===Other discoverers===
Others who have independently discovered or played roles in the development of the sampling theorem have been discussed in several historical articles, for example, by Jerri and by Lüke. For example, Lüke points out that H. Raabe, an assistant to Küpfmüller, proved the theorem in his 1939 Ph.D. dissertation; the term &quot;Raabe condition&quot; came to be associated with the criterion for unambiguous representation (sampling rate greater than twice the bandwidth). Meijering mentions several other discoverers and names in a paragraph and pair of footnotes:

In Russian literature it is known as the Kotelnikov&#x27;s theorem, named after Vladimir Kotelnikov, who discovered it in 1933.

===Why Nyquist?===
Exactly how, when, or why Harry Nyquist had his name attached to the sampling theorem remains obscure. The term &quot;Nyquist Sampling Theorem&quot; (capitalized thus) appeared as early as 1959 in a book from his former employer, Bell Labs, and appeared again in 1963, and not capitalized in 1965. It had been called the &quot;Shannon Sampling Theorem&quot; as early as 1954, but also just &quot;the sampling theorem&quot; by several other books in the early 1950s.

In 1958, Blackman and Tukey cited Nyquist&#x27;s 1928 article as a reference for &quot;the sampling theorem of information theory&quot;, even though that article does not treat sampling and reconstruction of continuous signals as others did. Their glossary of terms includes these entries:

Exactly what &quot;Nyquist&#x27;s result&quot; they are referring to remains mysterious.

When Shannon stated and proved the sampling theorem in his 1949 article, according to Meijering, &quot;he referred to the critical sampling interval formula_106 as the &quot;Nyquist interval&quot; corresponding to the band formula_107 in recognition of Nyquist&#x27;s discovery of the fundamental importance of this interval in connection with telegraphy&quot;. This explains Nyquist&#x27;s name on the critical interval, but not on the theorem.

Similarly, Nyquist&#x27;s name was attached to &quot;Nyquist rate&quot; in 1953 by Harold S. Black:

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, this may be the origin of the term &quot;Nyquist rate&quot;. In Black&#x27;s usage, it is not a sampling rate, but a signaling rate.

<text>A Select Library of the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church, usually known as the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers (NPNF), is a set of books containing translations of early Christian writings into English. It was published between 1886 and 1900.

Unlike the &quot;Ante-Nicene Fathers&quot; which was produced by using earlier translations of the Ante-Nicene Christian Library (ANCL), the &quot;Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers&quot; was printed simultaneously in Europe and in America, by T. &amp; T. Clark, by Christian Literature Company and other American editors. The translations were in the main revised versions of those made for the Oxford Movement Library of the Fathers series. T. &amp; T. Clark was surely convinced by the commercial success of the cheaper American version/revision of the ANCL, although of lesser quality on some minor points. The Swiss-born, German-educated Philip Schaff was commissioned to supervise the first series of the NPNF. He was joined by the British Henry Wace for the second series.

The volumes include the following:

<doc id="37869" wikidata="Q132716" url="?curid=37869" title="Pope Leo XI">
<text>Pope Leo XI (; 2 June 153527 April 1605), born Alessandro di Ottaviano de&#x27; Medici, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 1 April 1605 to his death, on 27 April 1605. His pontificate is one of the briefest in history, having lasted under a month. He was from the prominent House of Medici originating from Florence. Medici&#x27;s mother opposed his entering the priesthood and sought to prevent it by having him given secular honours, but after her death he eventually was ordained a priest in 1567. In his career he served as Florence&#x27;s ambassador to the pope, Bishop of Pistoia, Archbishop of Florence, Papal legate to France, and as the cardinal Prefect for the Congregation of Bishops and Regulars. He was elected to the papacy in the March 1605 papal conclave when he was almost seventy. He almost immediately suffered from fever and died 27 days into his papacy.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Alessandro di Ottaviano de&#x27; Medici was born in Florence as the son of Ottaviano de&#x27; Medici and Francesca Salviati. His family belonged to Medici di Ottajano, a cadet branch of the House of Medici. Ottaviano died early in his son&#x27;s life, and thereafter Alessandro was home schooled by a Dominican priest, Vincenzo Ercolano.

Alessandro felt the call to the priesthood, but his mother opposed this since he was the only male in the family. She sent him instead to the court of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, who appointed him a knight of San Stefano. In 1560 he travelled to Rome where he commenced a lifelong friendship and collaboration with Philip Neri, the future saint. It was Philip who predicted that Alessandro would ascend to the pontificate. His mother died in 1566, at which point he resumed his studies to become a priest. His ordination took place on 22 July 1567.

=== Priesthood ===
Alessandro served as the Florentine ambassador to Pope Pius V from 1569 to 1584 and in 1573 was appointed by Pope Gregory XIII Bishop of Pistoia. In March 1573 he received episcopal consecration in Rome. In 1574 he was made Archbishop of Florence.

In 1583 he was made a cardinal by Pope Sixtus V and on 9 January 1584 received the title of Cardinal-Priest of Santi Quirico e Giulitta, after a titular church previously known as San Ciriaco alle Terme Diocleziane. In later years, according to custom he would opt for other titular churches.

In 1596 Pope Clement VIII sent Alessandro as a papal legate to France, where he remained until 1598, when he received word of his appointment as Prefect of the Congregation of Bishops and Regulars.

== Pontificate ==
=== Papal election ===

On 14 March 1605, eleven days after the death of Clement VIII, 62 cardinals entered the conclave. Prominent among the candidates for the papacy were the great historian Caesar Baronius and the famous Jesuit controversialist Robert Bellarmine, future saint.

But Pietro Aldobrandini, the leader of the Italian party among the cardinals, allied with the French cardinals and brought about the election of Alessandro against the express wish of King Philip III of Spain. King Henry IV of France is said to have spent 300,000 écus in the promotion of Alessandro&#x27;s candidacy.

On 1 April 1605, Cardinal Alessandro de&#x27; Medici was elected as pope. He chose to be called Leo XI in honor of his uncle Pope Leo X. He was crowned on 10 April 1605 by the protodeacon, Cardinal Francesco Sforza and he took possession of the Basilica of Saint John Lateran on 17 April 1605.

== Death ==
When he was elected, Leo XI was almost 70 years of age, and he died 27 days later. His death came as a result of fatigue and cold in the ceremony of taking possession of the Basilica of St John Lateran on 17 April; he started suffering from a fever the following day.

<text>Pope Leo X (; born Giovanni di Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, 11 December 14751 December 1521) was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 9 March 1513 to his death, in December 1521.

Born into the prominent political and banking Medici family of Florence, Giovanni was the second son of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, ruler of the Florentine Republic, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1489. Following the death of Pope Julius II, Giovanni was elected pope after securing the backing of the younger members of the College of Cardinals. Early on in his rule he oversaw the closing sessions of the Fifth Council of the Lateran, but struggled to implement the reforms agreed. In 1517 he led a costly war that succeeded in securing his nephew Lorenzo di Piero de&#x27; Medici as Duke of Urbino, but reduced papal finances.

In Protestant circles, Leo is associated with granting indulgences for those who donated to reconstruct St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, a practice that was soon challenged by Martin Luther&#x27;s &quot;95 Theses&quot;. Leo rejected the Protestant Reformation, and his Papal bull of 1520, &quot;Exsurge Domine&quot;, condemned Luther&#x27;s condemnatory stance, rendering ongoing communication difficult.

He borrowed and spent money without circumspection and was a significant patron of the arts. Under his reign, Marco Girolamo Vida began composing at the Pope&#x27;s request a Virgilian Latin epic poem about the life of Jesus called the &quot;Christiad&quot;, progress was made on the rebuilding of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, and artists such as Raphael decorated the Vatican rooms. Leo also reorganised the Roman University, and promoted Renaissance humanist study of literature, poetry, and Classics. He died in 1521 and is buried in Santa Maria sopra Minerva, Rome. He was the last pope not to have been in priestly orders at the time of his election to the papacy.

==Early life==
Giovanni di Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici was born on 11 December 1475 in Florence, the second son of Lorenzo the Magnificent, head of the Florentine Republic, and Clarice Orsini. From an early age Giovanni was destined for an ecclesiastical career. He received the tonsure at the age of seven and was soon granted rich benefices and preferments.

His father, Lorenzo de Medici, was worried about his character early on and wrote a letter to Giovanni to warn him to avoid vice and luxury at the beginning of his ecclesiastical career. Here is a notable excerpt: &quot;There is one rule which I would recommend to your attention in preference to all others. Rise early in the morning. This will not only contribute to your health, but will enable you to arrange and expedite the business of the day; and as there are various duties incident to&quot;.

==Cardinal==
His father prevailed on his relative Pope Innocent VIII to name him cardinal of Santa Maria in Domnica on 9 March 1489 when he was age 13, although he was not allowed to wear the insignia or share in the deliberations of the college until three years later. Meanwhile, he received an education at Lorenzo&#x27;s humanistic court under such men as Angelo Poliziano, Pico della Mirandola, Marsilio Ficino and Bernardo Dovizio Bibbiena. From 1489 to 1491 he studied theology and canon law at Pisa.

On 23 March 1492, he was formally admitted into the Sacred College of Cardinals and took up his residence at Rome, receiving a letter of advice from his father. The death of Lorenzo on the following 8 April temporarily recalled the 16-year-old Giovanni to Florence. He returned to Rome to participate in the conclave of 1492 which followed the death of Innocent VIII, and unsuccessfully opposed the election of Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia as Pope Alexander VI.

He subsequently made his home with his elder brother Piero in Florence throughout the agitation of Girolamo Savonarola and the invasion of Charles VIII of France, until the uprising of the Florentines and the expulsion of the Medici in November 1494. While Piero found refuge at Venice and Urbino, Giovanni traveled in Germany, in the Netherlands, and in France.

In May 1500, he returned to Rome, where he was received with outward cordiality by Pope Alexander VI, and where he lived for several years immersed in art and literature. In 1503 he welcomed the accession of Pope Julius II to the pontificate; the death of Piero de&#x27; Medici in the same year made Giovanni head of his family. On 1 October 1511, he was appointed papal legate of Bologna and the Romagna, and when the Florentine republic declared in favour of the schismatic Pisans, Julius II sent Giovanni (as legate) with the Papal army venturing against the French. The French won a major battle and captured Giovanni. This and other attempts to regain political control of Florence were frustrated until a bloodless revolution permitted the return of the Medici. Giovanni&#x27;s younger brother Giuliano was placed at the head of the republic, but Giovanni managed the government.

==Pope==
===Papal election===

Giovanni was elected pope on 9 March 1513, and this was proclaimed two days later. The absence of the French cardinals effectively reduced the election to a contest between Giovanni (who had the support of the younger and noble members of the college) and Raffaele Riario (who had the support of the older group). On 15 March 1513, he was ordained priest, and consecrated as bishop on 17 March. He was crowned pope on 19 March 1513 at the age of 37. He was the last non-priest to be elected pope.

===War of Urbino===

Leo had intended his younger brother Giuliano and his nephew Lorenzo for brilliant secular careers. He had named them Roman patricians; the latter he had placed in charge of Florence; the former, for whom he planned to carve out a kingdom in central Italy of Parma, Piacenza, Ferrara and Urbino, he had taken with himself to Rome and married to Filiberta of Savoy.

The death of Giuliano in March 1516, however, caused the pope to transfer his ambitions to Lorenzo. At the very time (December 1516) that peace between France, Spain, Venice and the Habsburg monarchy seemed to give some promise of a Christendom united against the Turks, Leo obtained 150,000 ducats towards the expenses of the expedition from Henry VIII of England, in return for which he entered the imperial league of Spain and England against France.

The war lasted from February to September 1517 and ended with the expulsion of the duke and the triumph of Lorenzo; but it revived the policy of Alexander VI, increased brigandage and anarchy in the Papal States, hindered the preparations for a crusade and wrecked the papal finances. Francesco Guicciardini reckoned the cost of the war to Leo at the sum of 800,000 ducats. Ultimately, however, Lorenzo was confirmed as the new duke of Urbino.

===Plans for a crusade===
The War of Urbino was further marked by a crisis in the relations between the pope and the cardinals. The sacred college had allegedly grown very worldly and troublesome since the time of Sixtus IV, and Leo took advantage of a plot by several of its members to poison him, not only to inflict exemplary punishments by executing one (Alfonso Petrucci) and imprisoning several others, but also to make radical changes in the college.

On 3 July 1517, he published the names of thirty-one new cardinals, a number almost unprecedented in the history of the papacy. Among the nominations were such notable men such as Lorenzo Campeggio, Giovanni Battista Pallavicino, Adrian of Utrecht, Thomas Cajetan, Cristoforo Numai and Egidio Canisio. The naming of seven members of prominent Roman families, however, reversed the policy of his predecessor which had kept the political factions of the city out of the Curia. Other promotions were for political or family considerations or to secure money for the war against Urbino. The pope was accused of having exaggerated the conspiracy of the cardinals for purposes of financial gain, but most of such accusations appear unsubstantiated.

Leo, meanwhile, felt the need of staying the advance of the Ottoman sultan, Selim I, who was threatening eastern Europe, and made elaborate plans for a crusade. A truce was to be proclaimed throughout Christendom; the pope was to be the arbiter of disputes; the emperor and the king of France were to lead the army; England, Spain and Portugal were to furnish the fleet; and the combined forces were to be directed against Constantinople. Papal diplomacy in the interests of peace failed, however; Cardinal Thomas Wolsey made England, not the pope, the arbiter between France and the Empire; and much of the money collected for the crusade from tithes and indulgences was spent in other ways.

In 1519 Hungary concluded a three years&#x27; truce with Selim I, but the succeeding sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent, renewed the war in June 1521 and on 28 August captured the citadel of Belgrade. The pope was greatly alarmed, and although he was then involved in war with France he sent about 30,000 ducats to the Hungarians. Leo treated the Eastern Catholic Greeks with great loyalty, and by a bull of 18 May 1521 forbade Latin clergy to celebrate mass in Greek churches and Latin bishops to ordain Greek clergy. These provisions were later strengthened by Clement VII and Paul III and went far to settle the constant disputes between the Latins and Uniate Greeks.

===Protestant Reformation===

Leo was disturbed throughout his pontificate by schism, especially the Reformation sparked by Martin Luther.
In response to concerns about misconduct from some indulgence preachers, in 1517 Martin Luther wrote his &quot;Ninety-five Theses&quot; on the topic of indulgences. The resulting pamphlet spread Luther&#x27;s ideas throughout Germany and Europe. Leo failed to fully comprehend the importance of the movement, and in February 1518 he directed the vicar-general of the Augustinians to impose silence on his monks.

On 24 May, Luther sent an explanation of his theses to the pope; on 7 August he was summoned to appear at Rome. An arrangement was effected, however, whereby that summons was cancelled, and Luther went instead to Augsburg in October 1518 to meet the papal legate, Cardinal Cajetan; but neither the arguments of the cardinal, nor Leo&#x27;s dogmatic papal bull of 9 November requiring all Christians to believe in the pope&#x27;s power to grant indulgences, moved Luther to retract. A year of fruitless negotiations followed, during which the controversy took popular root across the German states.

A further papal bull of 15 June 1520, &quot;Exsurge Domine&quot; or &quot;Arise, O Lord&quot;, condemned forty-one propositions extracted from Luther&#x27;s teachings, and was taken to Germany by Johann Eck in his capacity as apostolic nuncio. Leo followed by formally excommunicating Luther by the bull &quot;Decet Romanum Pontificem&quot; or &quot;It Befits the Roman Pontiff&quot;, on 3 January 1521. In a brief, the Pope also directed Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor to take energetic measures against heresy.

Leo was pope during the spread of Lutheranism into Scandinavia. The pope had repeatedly used the rich northern benefices to reward members of the Roman curia, and towards the close of the year 1516, he sent the impolitic Giovanni Angelo Arcimboldi as papal nuncio to Denmark to collect money for St Peter&#x27;s. This led to the Reformation in Denmark. King Christian II took advantage of the growing dissatisfaction of the native clergy toward the papal government, and of Arcimboldi&#x27;s interference in the Swedish revolt, to expel the nuncio and summon Lutheran theologians to Copenhagen in 1520. Christian approved a plan by which a formal state church should be established in Denmark, all appeals to Rome should be abolished, and the king and diet should have final jurisdiction in ecclesiastical causes. Leo sent a new nuncio to Copenhagen (1521) in the person of the Minorite Francesco de Potentia, who readily absolved the king and received the bishopric of Skara. The pope or his legate, however, took no steps to correct abuses or otherwise discipline the Scandinavian churches.
===Other activities===
====Consistories====

The pope created 42 new cardinals in eight consistories including two cousins (one who would become his successor Pope Clement VII) and a nephew. He also elevated Adriaan Florensz Boeyens into the cardinalate who would become his immediate successor Pope Adrian VI. Leo X&#x27;s consistory of 1 July 1517 saw 31 cardinals created, and this remained the largest allocation of cardinals in one consistory until Pope John Paul II named 42 cardinals in 2001.

====Canonizations====
Pope Leo X canonized eleven individuals during his reign with seven of those being a group cause of martyrs. The most notable canonization from his papacy was that of Francis of Paola on 1 May 1519.

===Final years===
That Leo did not do more to check the anti-papal rebellion in Germany and Scandinavia is to be partially explained by the political complications of the time, and by his own preoccupation with papal and Medicean politics in Italy. The death of the Emperor Maximilian in 1519 had seriously affected the situation. Leo vacillated between the powerful candidates for the succession, allowing it to appear at first that he favoured Francis or a minor German prince. He finally accepted Charles of Spain as inevitable.

Leo was now eager to unite Ferrara, Parma and Piacenza to the Papal States. An attempt late in 1519 to seize Ferrara failed, and the pope recognized the need for foreign aid. In May 1521 a treaty of alliance was signed at Rome between him and the emperor. Milan and Genoa were to be taken from France and restored to the Empire, and Parma and Piacenza were to be given to the Church on the expulsion of the French. The expense of enlisting 10,000 Swiss was to be borne equally by Pope and emperor. Charles V took Florence and the Medici family under his protection and promised to punish all enemies of the Catholic faith. Leo agreed to invest Charles V with the Kingdom of Naples, to crown him Holy Roman Emperor, and to aid in a war against Venice. It was provided that England and the Swiss might also join the league. Henry VIII announced his adherence in August 1521. Francis I of France had already begun war with Charles V in Navarre, and in Italy, too, the French made the first hostile movement on 23 June 1521. Leo at once announced that he would excommunicate the king of France and release his subjects from their allegiance unless Francis I laid down his arms and surrendered Parma and Piacenza to the Church. The pope lived to hear the joyful news of the capture of Milan from the French and of the occupation by papal troops of the long-coveted provinces (November 1521).

Having fallen ill with bronchopneumonia, Pope Leo X died on 1 December 1521, so suddenly that the last sacraments could not be administered; but the contemporary suspicions of poison were unfounded. He was buried in Santa Maria sopra Minerva.

==Character, interests and talents==

===General assessment===
Leo has been criticized for his handling of the events of the papacy. He had a musical and pleasant voice and a cheerful temper. He was eloquent in speech and elegant in his manners and epistolary style. He enjoyed music and the theatre, art and poetry, the masterpieces of the ancients and the creations of his contemporaries, especially those seasoned with wit and learning. He especially delighted in ex tempore Latin verse-making (at which he excelled) and cultivated &quot;improvisatori&quot;. He is said to have stated, &quot;Let us enjoy the papacy since God has given it to us&quot;, Ludwig von Pastor says that it is by no means certain that he made the remark; and historian Klemens Löffler says that &quot;the Venetian ambassador who related this of him was not unbiased, nor was he in Rome at the time.&quot; However, there is no doubt that he was by nature pleasure-loving and that the anecdote reflects his casual attitude to the high and solemn office to which he had been called. On the other hand, in spite of his worldliness, Leo prayed, fasted, went to confession before celebrating Mass in public, and conscientiously participated in the religious services of the Church. To the virtues of liberality, charity, and clemency he added the Machiavellian qualities of deception and shrewdness, so highly esteemed by the princes of his time.

The character of Leo X was formerly assailed by lurid aspersions of debauchery, murder, impiety, and atheism. In the 17th century it was estimated that 300 or 400 writers, more or less, reported (on the authority of a single polemical anti-Catholic source) a story that when someone had quoted to Leo a passage from one of the Four Evangelists, he had replied that it was common knowledge &quot;how profitable that fable of Christe hath ben to us and our companie&quot;. These aspersions and more were examined by William Roscoe in the 19th century (and again by Ludwig von Pastor in the 20th) and rejected. Nevertheless, even the eminent philosopher David Hume, while claiming that Leo was too intelligent to believe in Catholic doctrine, conceded that he was &quot;one of the most illustrious princes that ever sat on the papal throne. Humane, beneficent, generous, affable; the patron of every art, and friend of every virtue&quot;. Martin Luther, in a to Leo, himself testified to Leo&#x27;s universal reputation for morality:
The final report of the Venetian ambassador Marino Giorgi supports Hume&#x27;s assessment of affability and testifies to the range of Leo&#x27;s talents. Bearing the date of March 1517 it indicates some of his predominant characteristics:
Leo is the fifth of the six popes who are unfavourably profiled by historian Barbara Tuchman in &quot;The March of Folly&quot;, and who are accused by her of precipitating the Protestant Reformation. Tuchman describes Leo as a cultured – if religiously devout – hedonist.

===Intellectual interests===

Leo X&#x27;s love for all forms of art stemmed from the humanistic education he received in Florence, his studies in Pisa and his extensive travel throughout Europe when a youth. He loved the Latin poems of the humanists, the tragedies of the Greeks and the comedies of Cardinal Bibbiena and Ariosto, while relishing the accounts sent back by the explorers of the New World. Yet &quot;Such a humanistic interest was itself religious. ... In the Renaissance, the vines of the classical world and the Christian world, of Rome, were seen as intertwined. It was a historically minded culture where artists&#x27; representations of Cupid and the Madonna, of Hercules and St. Peter could exist side-by-side&quot;.

===Love of music===
Pastor says that &quot;From his youth, Leo, who had a fine ear and a melodious voice, loved music to the pitch of fanaticism&quot;. As pope he procured the services of professional singers, instrumentalists and composers from as far away as France, Germany and Spain. Francesco Canova da Milano, the foremost lute composer of his time, was prominent in his musical establishment. Next to goldsmiths, the highest salaries recorded in the papal accounts are those paid to musicians, who also received largesse from Leo&#x27;s private purse. Their services were retained not so much for the delectation of Leo and his guests at private social functions as for the enhancement of religious services on which the pope placed great store. The standard of singing of the papal choir was a particular object of Leo&#x27;s concern, with French, Dutch, Spanish and Italian singers being retained. Large sums of money were also spent on the acquisition of highly ornamented musical instruments, and he was especially assiduous in securing musical scores from Florence. He also fostered technical improvements developed for the diffusion of such scores. Ottaviano Petrucci, who had overcome practical difficulties in the way of using movable type to print musical notation, obtained from Leo X the exclusive privilege of printing organ scores (which, according to the papal brief, &quot;adds greatly to the dignity of divine worship&quot;) for a period for 15 years from 22 October 1513. In addition to fostering the performance of sung Masses, he promoted the singing of the Gospel in Greek in his private chapel.

===Unpopular behavior and scandals===

Even those who defend him against the more outlandish attacks on his character acknowledge that he partook of entertainment such as masquerades, &quot;jests,&quot; fowling, and hunting boar and other wild beasts. According to one biographer, he was &quot;engrossed in idle and selfish amusements&quot;.

Leo indulged buffoons at his Court, but also tolerated behaviour which made them the object of ridicule. One case concerned the conceited &quot;improvisatore&quot; Giacomo Baraballo, Abbot of Gaeta, who was the butt of a burlesque procession organised in the style of an ancient Roman triumph. Baraballo was dressed in festal robes of velvet and with ermine and presented to the pope. He was then taken to the piazza of St Peter&#x27;s and was mounted on the back of Hanno, a white elephant, the gift of King Manuel I of Portugal. The magnificently ornamented animal was then led off in the direction of the Capitol to the sound of drums and trumpets. But while crossing the bridge of Sant&#x27;Angelo over the Tiber, the elephant, already distressed by the noise and confusion around him, shied violently, throwing his passenger onto the muddy riverbank below.

Leo&#x27;s biographer, Carlo Falconi, says Leo hid a private life of moral irregularity behind a mask of urbanity. Scabrous verse libels of the type known as pasquinades were particularly abundant during the conclave which followed Leo&#x27;s death in 1521 and made imputations about Leo&#x27;s unchastity, implying or asserting homosexuality. Suggestions of homosexual attraction appear in works by two contemporary historians, Francesco Guicciardini and Paolo Giovio. Zimmerman notes Giovio&#x27;s &quot;disapproval of the pope&#x27;s familiar banter with his chamberlains – handsome young men from noble families – and the advantage he was said to take of them.&quot;

Luther spent a month in Rome in 1510, three years before Leo became pontiff, and was disillusioned at the corruption he found there. In 1520, the year before his excommunication from the Catholic Church, Luther claimed that Leo lived a &quot;blameless life.&quot; However, Luther later distanced himself from this claim and alleged in 1531 that Leo had vetoed a measure that cardinals should restrict the number of boys they kept for their pleasure, &quot;otherwise it would have been spread throughout the world how openly and shamelessly the pope and the cardinals in Rome practice sodomy.&quot; Against this allegation is the papal bull &quot;Supernae dispositionis arbitrio&quot; from 1514 which, &quot;inter alia&quot;, required cardinals to live &quot;... soberly, chastely, and piously, abstaining not only from evil but also from every appearance of evil&quot; and a contemporary and eye-witness at Leo&#x27;s Court (Matteo Herculaneo), emphasized his belief that Leo was chaste all his life.

Historians have dealt with the issue of Leo&#x27;s sexuality at least since the late 18th century, and few have given credence to the imputations made against him in his later years and decades following his death, or else have at least regarded them as unworthy of notice; without necessarily reaching conclusions on whether he was homosexual. Those who stand outside this consensus generally fall short of concluding with certainty that Leo was unchaste during his pontificate. Joseph McCabe accused Pastor of untruthfulness and Vaughan of lying in the course of their treatment of the evidence, pointing out that Giovio and Guicciardini seemed to share the belief that Leo engaged in &quot;unnatural vice&quot; (homosexuality) while pope.

===Benevolence===
Leo X made charitable donations of more than 6,000 ducats annually to retirement homes, hospitals, convents, discharged soldiers, pilgrims, poor students, exiles, cripples, and the sick and unfortunate.

==Death and legacy==

===Death===
Pope Leo X died suddenly of pneumonia at the age of 45 on 1 December 1521 and was buried in Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome. His death came just 10 months after he had excommunicated Martin Luther, the seminal figure in the Protestant Reformation, who was accused of 41 errors in his teachings.

===Failure to stem the Reformation===
Possibly the most lasting legacy of the reign of Pope Leo X was his perceived failure not just to stem the Reformation but to fuel it. A key issue was that his pontificate failed to bring about the reforms decreed by the Fifth Lateran Council (held between 1512 and 1517) which aimed to deal with many of their political problems as well as to reform Christendom, specifically relating to the papacy, cardinals, and curia. Some believe enforcing these decrees may have been enough to dampen support for radical challenges to church authority. But instead under his leadership, Rome&#x27;s fiscal and political problems were deepened. A major contributor was his lavish spending (especially on the arts and himself) which led the papal treasury into mounting debt and his decision to authorize the sale of indulgences. The exploitation of people and corruption of religious principles linked to the practice of selling indulgences quickly became the key stimulus for the onset of the Protestant Reformation. Martin Luther&#x27;s &quot;95 Theses&quot;, otherwise entitled &quot;Disputation on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences&quot;, was posted on a Church door in Wittenberg, Germany in October 1517 just seven months after the Lateran V was completed. But Pope Leo X&#x27;s attempt to prosecute Luther&#x27;s teaching on indulgences, and to eventually excommunicate him in January 1521, did not get rid of Lutheran doctrine but had the opposite effect of further splintering the Western church.

===Excessive spending===
Leo was renowned for spending money lavishly on the arts; on charities; on benefices for his friends, relatives, and even people he barely knew; on dynastic wars, such as the War of Urbino; and on his own personal luxury. Within two years of becoming Pope, Leo X spent all of the treasure amassed by the previous Pope, the frugal Julius II, and drove the Papacy into deep debt. By the end of his pontificate in 1521, the papal treasury was 400,000 ducats in debt. This debt contributed not only to the calamities of Leo&#x27;s own pontificate (particularly the sale of indulgences that precipitated Protestantism) but severely constrained later pontificates (Pope Adrian VI; and Leo&#x27;s beloved cousin, Clement VII) and forced austerity measures.

Leo X&#x27;s personal spending was likewise vast. For 1517, his personal income is recorded as 580,000 ducats, of which 420,000 came from the states of the Church, 100,000 from annates, and 60,000 from the composition tax instituted by Sixtus IV. These sums, together with the considerable amounts accruing from indulgences, jubilees, and special fees, vanished as quickly as they were received. To remain financially solvent, the Pope resorted to desperate measures: instructing his cousin, Cardinal Giulio de&#x27; Medici, to pawn the Papal jewels; palace furniture; tableware; and even statues of the apostles. Additionally, Leo sold cardinals&#x27; hats; memberships to a fraternal order he invented in 1520, the &quot;Papal Knights of St. Peter and St. Paul&quot;; and borrowed such immense sums from bankers that upon his death, many were ruined.

At Leo&#x27;s death, the Venetian ambassador Gradenigo estimated the number of the Church&#x27;s paying offices at 2,150, with a capital value of approximately 3,000,000 ducats and a yearly income of 328,000 ducats.

===Patron of learning===
Leo X raised the Church to a high rank as the friend of whatever seemed to extend knowledge or to refine and embellish life. He made the capital of Christendom, Rome, a centre of European culture. While yet a cardinal, he had restored the church of Santa Maria in Domnica after Raphael&#x27;s designs; and as pope he had San Giovanni dei Fiorentini, on the Via Giulia, built, after designs by Jacopo Sansovino and pressed forward the work on St Peter&#x27;s Basilica and the Vatican under Raphael and Agostino Chigi. Leo&#x27;s constitution of 5 November 1513 reformed the Roman university, which had been neglected by Julius II. He restored all its faculties, gave larger salaries to the professors, and summoned distinguished teachers from afar; and, although it never attained to the importance of Padua or Bologna, it nevertheless possessed in 1514 a faculty (with a good reputation) of eighty-eight professors.

Leo called Janus Lascaris to Rome to give instruction in Greek, and established a Greek printing press from which the first Greek book printed in Rome appeared in 1515. He made Raphael custodian of the classical antiquities of Rome and the vicinity, the ancient monuments of which formed the subject of a famous letter from Raphael to the pope in 1519. The distinguished Latinists Pietro Bembo and Jacopo Sadoleto were papal secretaries, as well as the famous poet Bernardo Accolti. Other poets, such as Marco Girolamo Vida, Gian Giorgio Trissino and Bibbiena, writers of &quot;novelle&quot; like Matteo Bandello, and a hundred other &quot;literati&quot; of the time were bishops, or papal scriptors or abbreviators, or in other papal employs.

=== Statesman ===
Several minor events of Leo&#x27;s pontificate are worthy of mention. He was particularly friendly with King Manuel I of Portugal as a result of the latter&#x27;s missionary enterprises in Asia and Africa. Pope Leo X was granted a large embassy from the Portuguese king furnished with goods from Manuel&#x27;s colonies. His concordat with Florence (1516) guaranteed the free election of the clergy in that city.

His constitution of 1 March 1519 condemned the King of Spain&#x27;s claim to refuse the publication of papal bulls. He maintained close relations with Poland because of the Turkish advance and the Polish contest with the Teutonic Knights. His bull of July 1519, which regulated the discipline of the Polish Church, was later transformed into a concordat by Clement VII.

Leo showed special favours to the Jews and permitted them to erect a Hebrew printing-press in Rome. Under Daniel Bomberg, that press produced manuscripts of the Talmud and Mikraot Gedolot with Leo&#x27;s approval and protection.

He approved the formation of the Oratory of Divine Love, a group of pious men in Rome which later became the Theatine Order, and he canonized Francis of Paola.

<text>A beta particle, also called beta ray or beta radiation (symbol β), is a high-energy, high-speed electron or positron emitted by the radioactive decay of an atomic nucleus, known as beta decay. There are two forms of beta decay, β− decay and β+ decay, which produce electrons and positrons, respectively.

Beta particles with an energy of 0.5 MeV have a range of about one metre in the air; the distance is dependent on the particle&#x27;s energy and the air&#x27;s density and composition.

Beta particles are a type of ionizing radiation, and for radiation protection purposes, they are regarded as being more ionising than gamma rays, but less ionising than alpha particles. The higher the ionising effect, the greater the damage to living tissue, but also the lower the penetrating power of the radiation through matter.

==Beta decay modes==

=== β− decay (electron emission) ===

An unstable atomic nucleus with an excess of neutrons may undergo β− decay, where a neutron is converted into a proton, an electron, and an electron antineutrino (the antiparticle of the neutrino):

This process is mediated by the weak interaction. The neutron turns into a proton through the emission of a virtual W− boson. At the quark level, W− emission turns a down quark into an up quark, turning a neutron (one up quark and two down quarks) into a proton (two up quarks and one down quark).
The virtual W− boson then decays into an electron and an antineutrino.

β− decay commonly occurs among the neutron-rich fission byproducts produced in nuclear reactors. Free neutrons also decay via this process. Both of these processes contribute to the copious quantities of beta rays and electron antineutrinos produced by fission-reactor fuel rods.

=== β+ decay (positron emission) ===

Unstable atomic nuclei with an excess of protons may undergo β+ decay, also called positron decay, where a proton is converted into a neutron, a positron, and an electron neutrino:

Beta-plus decay can only happen inside nuclei when the absolute value of the binding energy of the daughter nucleus is greater than that of the parent nucleus, i.e., the daughter nucleus is a lower-energy state.

===Beta decay schemes===

The accompanying decay scheme diagram shows the beta decay of caesium-137. 137Cs is noted for a characteristic gamma peak at 661 keV, but this is actually emitted by the daughter radionuclide 137mBa. The diagram shows the type and energy of the emitted radiation, its relative abundance, and the daughter nuclides after decay.

Phosphorus-32 is a beta emitter widely used in medicine. It has a short half-life of 14.29 days and decays into sulfur-32 by beta decay as shown in this nuclear equation:
1.709 MeV of energy is released during the decay. The kinetic energy of the electron varies with an average of approximately 0.5 MeV and the remainder of the energy is carried by the nearly undetectable electron antineutrino. In comparison to other beta radiation-emitting nuclides, the electron is moderately energetic. It is blocked by around 1 m of air or 5 mm of acrylic glass.

== Interaction with other matter ==

Of the three common types of radiation given off by radioactive materials, alpha, beta and gamma, beta has the medium penetrating power and the medium ionising power. Although the beta particles given off by different radioactive materials vary in energy, most beta particles can be stopped by a few millimeters of aluminium. However, this does not mean that beta-emitting isotopes can be completely shielded by such thin shields: as they decelerate in matter, beta electrons emit secondary gamma rays, which are more penetrating than betas per se. Shielding composed of materials with lower atomic weight generates gammas with lower energy, making such shields somewhat more effective per unit mass than ones made of larger atoms such as lead.

Being composed of charged particles, beta radiation is more strongly ionizing than gamma radiation. When passing through matter, a beta particle is decelerated by electromagnetic interactions and may give off bremsstrahlung X-rays.

In water, beta radiation from many nuclear fission products typically exceeds the speed of light in that material (which is about 75% that of light in vacuum), and thus generates blue Cherenkov radiation when it passes through water. The intense beta radiation from the fuel rods of swimming pool reactors can thus be visualized through the transparent water that covers and shields the reactor (see illustration at right).

=== Detection and measurement ===

The ionizing or excitation effects of beta particles on matter are the fundamental processes by which radiometric detection instruments detect and measure beta radiation. The ionization of gas is used in ion chambers and Geiger–Müller counters, and the excitation of scintillators is used in scintillation counters.
The following table shows radiation quantities in SI and non-SI units:
* The gray (Gy) is the SI unit of absorbed dose, which is the amount of radiation energy deposited in the irradiated material. For beta radiation this is numerically equal to the equivalent dose measured by the sievert, which indicates the stochastic biological effect of low levels of radiation on human tissue. The radiation weighting conversion factor from absorbed dose to equivalent dose is 1 for beta, whereas alpha particles have a factor of 20, reflecting their greater ionising effect on tissue.
* The rad is the deprecated CGS unit for absorbed dose and the rem is the deprecated CGS unit of equivalent dose, used mainly in the USA.

=== Beta spectroscopy ===
The energy contained within individual beta particles is measured via &quot;beta spectrometry&quot;; the study of the obtained distribution of energies as a spectrum is &quot;beta spectroscopy&quot;. Determination of this energy is done by measuring the amount of deflection of the electron&#x27;s path under a magnetic field.

== Applications ==
Beta particles can be used to treat health conditions such as eye and bone cancer and are also used as tracers. Strontium-90 is the material most commonly used to produce beta particles.

Beta particles are also used in quality control to test the thickness of an item, such as paper, coming through a system of rollers. Some of the beta radiation is absorbed while passing through the product. If the product is made too thick or thin, a correspondingly different amount of radiation will be absorbed. A computer program monitoring the quality of the manufactured paper will then move the rollers to change the thickness of the final product.

An illumination device called a &quot;betalight&quot; contains tritium and a phosphor. As tritium decays, it emits beta particles; these strike the phosphor, causing the phosphor to give off photons, much like the cathode-ray tube in a television. The illumination requires no external power, and will continue as long as the tritium exists (and the phosphors do not themselves chemically change); the amount of light produced will drop to half its original value in 12.32 years, the half-life of tritium.

Beta-plus (or positron) decay of a radioactive tracer isotope is the source of the positrons used in positron emission tomography (PET scan).

== History ==
Henri Becquerel, while experimenting with fluorescence, accidentally found out that uranium exposed a photographic plate, wrapped with black paper, with some unknown radiation that could not be turned off like X-rays.

Ernest Rutherford continued these experiments and discovered two different kinds of radiation:

* alpha particles that did not show up on the Becquerel plates because they were easily absorbed by the black wrapping paper
* beta particles which are 100 times more penetrating than alpha particles.

He published his results in 1899.

In 1900, Becquerel measured the mass-to-charge ratio () for beta particles by the method of J. J. Thomson used to study cathode rays and identify the electron. He found that for a beta particle is the same as for Thomson&#x27;s electron, and therefore suggested that the beta particle is in fact an electron.

== Health ==
Beta particles are moderately penetrating in living tissue, and can cause spontaneous mutation in DNA.

Beta sources can be used in radiation therapy to kill cancer cells.

<text>August Ferdinand Möbius (, ; ; 17 November 1790 – 26 September 1868) was a German mathematician and theoretical astronomer.

==Life and education==
Möbius was born in Schulpforta, Electorate of Saxony, and was descended on his mother&#x27;s side from religious reformer Martin Luther. He was home-schooled until he was 13, when he attended the college in Schulpforta in 1803, and studied there, graduating in 1809. He then enrolled at the University of Leipzig, where he studied astronomy under the mathematician and astronomer Karl Mollweide. In 1813, he began to study astronomy under mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss at the University of Göttingen, while Gauss was the director of the Göttingen Observatory. From there, he went to study with Carl Gauss&#x27;s instructor, Johann Pfaff, at the University of Halle, where he completed his doctoral thesis &quot;The occultation of fixed stars&quot; in 1815. In 1816, he was appointed as Extraordinary Professor to the &quot;chair of astronomy and higher mechanics&quot; at the University of Leipzig. Möbius died in Leipzig in 1868 at the age of 77. 

His son Theodor was a noted philologist.

==Contributions==
He is best known for his discovery of the Möbius strip, a non-orientable two-dimensional surface with only one side when embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space. It was independently discovered by Johann Benedict Listing a few months earlier. The Möbius configuration, formed by two mutually inscribed tetrahedra, is also named after him. Möbius was the first to introduce homogeneous coordinates into projective geometry. He is recognized for the introduction of the barycentric coordinate system. Before 1853 and Schläfli&#x27;s discovery of the 4-polytopes, Möbius (with Cayley and Grassmann) was one of only three other people who had also conceived of the possibility of geometry in more than three dimensions.

Many mathematical concepts are named after him, including the Möbius plane, the Möbius transformations, important in projective geometry, and the Möbius transform of number theory. His interest in number theory led to the important Möbius function μ(&quot;n&quot;) and the Möbius inversion formula. In Euclidean geometry, he systematically developed the use of signed angles and line segments as a way of simplifying and unifying results.

<doc id="37876" wikidata="Q214700" url="?curid=37876" title="National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration">
<text>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA ) is an American scientific and regulatory agency charged with forecasting weather, monitoring oceanic and atmospheric conditions, charting the seas, conducting deep-sea exploration, and managing fishing and protection of marine mammals and endangered species in the US exclusive economic zone. The agency is part of the United States Department of Commerce and is headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland. NOAA supports the &quot;Dynamic Planet&quot;, and &quot;Meteorology&quot; events in Science Olympiad.

== History ==
NOAA traces its history back to multiple agencies, some of which are among the earliest in the federal government:
* United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, formed in 1807
* Weather Bureau of the United States, formed in 1870
* Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, formed in 1871 (research fleet only)
* Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps, formed in 1917

The most direct predecessor of NOAA was the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA), into which several existing scientific agencies such as the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, the Weather Bureau, and the uniformed Corps were absorbed in 1965.

NOAA was established within the Department of Commerce via the Reorganization Plan No. 4, and formed on October 3, 1970, after U.S. President Richard Nixon proposed creating a new agency to serve a national need for &quot;better protection of life and property from natural hazards... for a better understanding of the total environment... [and] for exploration and development leading to the intelligent use of our marine resources&quot;.

NOAA is a part of the Department of Commerce rather than the Department of Interior, because of a feud between President Nixon and his interior secretary, Wally Hickel, over the Nixon Administration&#x27;s Vietnam War policy. Nixon did not like Hickel&#x27;s letter urging Nixon to listen to the Vietnam War demonstrators, and punished Hickel by not putting NOAA in the Interior Department.

In 2007, NOAA celebrated 200 years of service in its role as successor to the U.S. Survey of the Coast.

NOAA was officially formed in 1970. In 2021, NOAA had 11,833 civilian employees. Its research and operations are further supported by 321 uniformed service members, who make up the NOAA Commissioned Corps.

Project 2025 has proposed to get rid of the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, which would &quot;dismantle&quot; NOAA&#x27;s research division.

On February 27, 2025, several hundred NOAA staffers, mainly probationary, were laid off after staffers from the Department of Government Efficiency entered the headquarters of NOAA.

== Organizational structure ==
=== Silver Spring Campus ===
Since 1993, NOAA&#x27;s administrative headquarters has been located at the Silver Spring Metro Center office complex in downtown Silver Spring, Maryland. The consolidated , four-building campus was constructed in 1993 and is home to over 40 NOAA sub-agencies and offices, including the National Weather Service. 

=== Administrator ===
Nancy A. Hann is the current acting Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere and NOAA Administrator as of January 20, 2025, following the resignation of Richard (Rick) W. Spinrad.

From February 25, 2019, to January 20, 2021, Neil Jacobs, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Environmental Observation and Prediction, served as acting Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere at the US Department of Commerce and as NOAA&#x27;s interim administrator. Jacobs succeeded Timothy Gallaudet, who succeeded Benjamin Friedman. The three served in series as NOAA&#x27;s interim administrator throughout the first Trump Administration. In October 2017, Barry Lee Myers, CEO of AccuWeather, was proposed to be the agency&#x27;s administrator by the Trump Administration. After two years in the nomination process, on November 21, 2019, Myers withdrew his name from consideration due to health concerns.

=== Independent agency proposal ===
NOAA was created by an executive order in 1970 and has never been established in law, despite its critical role. In January 2023, The Washington Post reported that Congressman Frank Lucas, the new chair of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, had released draft legislation to make NOAA an independent agency, rather than it being part of the Commerce Department. Lucas&#x27; push was in response to Republican leaders who had signaled plans to slash funding for agencies and programs that continued to receive annual appropriations, but had not been reauthorized by Congress. &quot;It&#x27;s been made quite clear in the Republican conference that my friends don&#x27;t want to fund programs that are not properly authorized,&quot; said Lucas. &quot;NOAA is very important, so we need to get it authorized.&quot;

=== Services ===
NOAA works toward its mission through six major line offices: the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the National Ocean Service (NOS), the National Weather Service (NWS), the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) and the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO). NOAA has more than a dozen staff offices, including the Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology, the NOAA Central Library, the Office of Program Planning and Integration (PPI).

==== National Weather Service ====
The National Weather Service (NWS) is tasked with providing &quot;weather, hydrologic and climate forecasts and warnings for the United States, its territories, adjacent waters and ocean areas, for the protection of life and property and the enhancement of the national economy&quot;, according to NOAA. This is done through a collection of national and regional centers, 13 river forecast centers (RFCs), and more than 120 local weather forecast offices (WFOs). They are charged with issuing weather and river forecasts, advisories, watches, and warnings on a daily basis. They issue more than 734,000 weather and 850,000 river forecasts, and more than 45,000 severe weather warnings annually. NOAA data is also relevant to the issues of climate change and ozone depletion.

The NWS operates NEXRAD, a nationwide network of Doppler weather radars which can detect precipitation and their velocities. Many of their products are broadcast on NOAA Weather Radio, a network of radio transmitters that broadcasts weather forecasts, severe weather statements, watches and warnings 24 hours a day.

==== National Ocean Service ====
The National Ocean Service (NOS) focuses on ensuring that ocean and coastal areas are safe, healthy, and productive. NOS scientists, natural resource managers, and specialists serve America by ensuring safe and efficient marine transportation, promoting innovative solutions to protect coastal communities, and conserving marine and coastal places.

The National Ocean Service is composed of eight program offices: the Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services, the Office for Coastal Management, the National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, the Office of Coast Survey, the Office of National Geodetic Survey, the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, and the Office of Response and Restoration.

There are two NOS programs, the Mussel Watch Contaminant Monitoring Program and the NOAA Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS). There are two staff offices, the International Program Office and the Management and Budget Office.

==== National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service ====

The National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) was created by NOAA to operate and manage the US environmental satellite programs, and manage NWS data and those of other government agencies and departments. NESDIS&#x27;s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) archives data collected by the NOAA, United States Navy, United States Air Force, the Federal Aviation Administration, and meteorological services around the world. It comprises the Center for Weather and Climate, previously NOAA&#x27;s National Climatic Data Center, the National Coastal Data Development Center (NCDDC), the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC), and the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC)).

In 1960, TIROS-1, NASA&#x27;s first owned and operated geostationary satellite, was launched. Since 1966, NESDIS has managed polar orbiting satellites (POES). Since 1974, it has operated geosynchronous satellites (GOES). In 1979, NOAA&#x27;s first polar-orbiting environmental satellite was launched. Current operational satellites include NOAA-15, NOAA-18, NOAA-19, GOES 13, GOES 14, GOES 15, Jason-2 and DSCOVR. In 1983, NOAA assumed operational responsibility for the Landsat satellite system.

Since May 1998, NESDIS has operated the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites on behalf of the Air Force Weather Agency.

New generations of satellites are developed to succeed the current polar orbiting and geosynchronous satellites, the Joint Polar Satellite System, and GOES-R, which launched in November 2016.

NESDIS runs the Office of Projects, Planning, and Analysis (OPPA) formerly the Office of Systems Development, the Office of Satellite Ground Systems (formerly the Office of Satellite Operations) the Office of Satellite and Project Operations, the Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR)], the Joint Polar Satellite System Program Office the GOES-R Program Office, the International &amp; Interagency Affairs Office, the Office of Space Commerce and the Office of System Architecture and Advanced Planning.

==== National Marine Fisheries Service ====
The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), also known as NOAA Fisheries, was initiated in 1871 with a primary goal of the research, protection, management, and restoration of commercial and recreational fisheries and their habitat, and protected species. The NMFS operates twelve headquarters offices, five regional offices, six fisheries science centers, and more than 20 laboratories throughout the United States and U.S. territories, which are the sites of research and management of marine resources. The NMFS operates the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Office of Law Enforcement in Silver Spring, Maryland, which is the primary site of marine resource law enforcement.

==== Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research ====
NOAA&#x27;s research, conducted through the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR), is the driving force behind NOAA environmental products and services that protect life and property and promote economic growth. Research, conducted in OAR laboratories and by extramural programs, focuses on enhancing our understanding of environmental phenomena such as tornadoes, hurricanes, climate variability, solar flares, changes in the ozone, air pollution transport and dispersion, El Niño/La Niña events, fisheries productivity, ocean currents, deep sea thermal vents, and coastal ecosystem health. NOAA research also develops innovative technologies and observing systems.

The NOAA Research network consists of seven internal research laboratories, extramural research at 30 Sea Grant university and research programs, six undersea research centers, a research grants program through the Climate Program Office, and 13 cooperative institutes with academia. Through NOAA and its academic partners, thousands of scientists, engineers, technicians, and graduate students participate in furthering our knowledge of natural phenomena that affect the lives of us all.

The Air Resources Laboratory (ARL) is one of the laboratories in the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research. It studies processes and develops models relating to climate and air quality, including the transport, dispersion, transformation and removal of pollutants from the ambient atmosphere. The emphasis of the ARL&#x27;s work is on data interpretation, technology development and transfer. The specific goal of ARL research is to improve and eventually to institutionalize prediction of trends, dispersion of air pollutant plumes, air quality, atmospheric deposition, and related variables.

The Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML), is part of NOAA&#x27;s Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, located in Miami, Florida. AOML&#x27;s research spans hurricanes, coastal ecosystems, oceans, and human health, climate studies, global carbon systems, and ocean observations. AOML&#x27;s organizational structure consists of an Office of the Director and three scientific research divisions, Physical Oceanography, Ocean Chemistry and Ecosystems, and Hurricane Research. The Office of the Director oversees the Laboratory&#x27;s scientific programs, as well as its financial, administrative, computer, outreach/education, and facility management services.

Research programs are augmented by the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS), a joint enterprise with the University of Miami&#x27;s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. CIMAS enables AOML and university scientists to collaborate on research areas of mutual interest and facilitates the participation of students and visiting scientists. AOML is a member of a unique community of marine research and educational institutions located on Virginia Key in Miami, Florida.

In 1977, the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) deployed the first successful moored equatorial current meter – the beginning of the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean, TAO, array. In 1984, the Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere program (TOGA) program began.

The Arctic Report Card is the annual update charts of the ongoing impact of changing conditions on the environment and community by NOAA. In 2019, it was compiled by 81 scientists from 12 nations.

==== Office of Marine and Aviation Operations ====

The Office of Marine and Aviation Operations is responsible for the fleet of NOAA ships, aircraft, and diving operations. It is the largest research fleet in the Federal government. Its personnel is made up of federal civil service employees and NOAA Corps Commissioned Officers. The office is led by a NOAA Corps two-star Rear Admiral, who also commands the NOAA Corps.

==== National Geodetic Survey ====
The National Geodetic Survey (NGS) is a major surveying organization in the United States.

==== National Integrated Drought Information System ====
The National Integrated Drought Information System is a program within NOAA with an interagency mandate to coordinate and integrate drought research, building upon existing federal, tribal, state, and local partnerships in support of creating a national drought early warning information system.

==== NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps ====
The NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps is a uniformed service of men and women who operate NOAA ships and aircraft, and serve in scientific and administrative posts.

== Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ==
Since 2001, the organization has hosted the senior staff and recent chair, Susan Solomon, of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&#x27;s working group on climate science.

== Hurricane Dorian controversy ==

Hurricane Dorian was an extremely powerful and destructive tropical cyclone that devastated the northwestern Bahamas and caused significant damage to the Southeastern United States and Atlantic Canada in September 2019. By September 1, NOAA had issued a statement saying that the &quot;current forecast path of Dorian does not include Alabama&quot;. However, on that date, President Donald Trump tweeted that Alabama, among other states, &quot;will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated&quot;.

Shortly thereafter, the Birmingham, Alabama office of the National Weather Service issued a tweet that appeared to contradict Trump, saying that Alabama &quot;will NOT see any impacts from Dorian&quot;. On September 6, NOAA published a statement from an unidentified spokesperson supporting Trump&#x27;s September 1 claim. The statement also labelled the Birmingham, Alabama branch of the National Weather Service&#x27;s contradiction of Trump as incorrect. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the NOAA September 6 statement was prompted by a threat from U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to fire high-level NOAA staff unless they supported Trump&#x27;s claim. The Department of Commerce described this report as &quot;false&quot;.

Meanwhile, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that NOAA had twice ordered National Weather Service employees not to provide &quot;any opinion&quot; on Hurricane Dorian and to &quot;only stick with official National Hurricane Center forecasts&quot;. The first order came after Trump&#x27;s September 1 comments and the Birmingham, Alabama National Weather Service&#x27;s contradiction of Trump. The second order came on September 4 after Trump displayed an August 29 map that was altered with a black marker to show that Hurricane Dorian may hit Alabama.

On September 9, speaking at an Alabama National Weather Service (NWS) meeting the Director of the National Weather Service gave a speech supporting Birmingham NWS and said the team &quot;stopped public panic&quot; and &quot;ensured public safety&quot;. He said that when Birmingham issued their instructions they were not aware that the calls they were receiving were a result of Trump&#x27;s tweet. The acting chief scientist and assistant administrator for the ocean and atmospheric research said he is &quot;pursuing the potential violations&quot; of the agency&#x27;s scientific integrity policy.

== Flag ==
The NOAA flag is a modification of the flag of one of its predecessor organizations, the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. The Coast and Geodetic Survey&#x27;s flag, authorized in 1899 and in use until 1970, was blue, with a white circle centered in it and a red triangle centered within the circle. It symbolized the use of triangulation in surveying, and was flown by ships of the Survey.

When NOAA was established in 1970 and the Coast and Geodetic Survey&#x27;s assets became a part of NOAA, NOAA based its own flag on that of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The NOAA flag is, in essence, the Coast and Geodetic Survey flag, with the NOAA logo—a circle divided by the silhouette of a seabird into an upper dark blue and a lower light blue section, but with the &quot;NOAA&quot; legend omitted—centered within the red triangle. NOAA ships in commission display the NOAA flag; those with only one mast fly it immediately beneath the ship&#x27;s commissioning pennant or the personal flag of a civilian official or flag officer if one is aboard the ship, while multimasted vessels fly it at the masthead of the forwardmost mast. NOAA ships fly the same ensign as United States Navy ships but fly the NOAA flag as a distinguishing mark to differentiate themselves from Navy ships.

<text>Crocodiles (family Crocodylidae) or true crocodiles are large, semiaquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. The term “crocodile” is sometimes used more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes the alligators and caimans (both members of the family Alligatoridae), the gharial and false gharial (both members of the family Gavialidae) as well as other, extinct, taxa.

Although crocodiles, alligators, and the gharial are similar in appearance, they belong to separate biological families. The gharial, with its narrow snout, is easier to distinguish, while morphological differences are more difficult to spot in crocodiles and alligators. The most obvious external differences are visible in the head, with crocodiles having narrower and longer heads, with a more V-shaped than a U-shaped snout compared to alligators and caimans. Another obvious trait is that the upper and lower jaws of the crocodiles are the same width, and the teeth in the lower jaw fall along the edge or outside the upper jaw when the mouth is closed; therefore, all teeth are visible, unlike an alligator, which possesses in the upper jaw small depressions into which the lower teeth fit. Also, when the crocodile&#x27;s mouth is closed, the large fourth tooth in the lower jaw fits into a constriction in the upper jaw. For hard-to-distinguish specimens, the protruding tooth is the most reliable feature to define the species&#x27; family. Crocodiles have more webbing on the toes of the hind feet and can better tolerate saltwater due to specialized salt glands for filtering out salt, which are present, but non-functioning, in alligators. Another trait that separates crocodiles from other crocodilians is their much higher levels of aggression.

Crocodile size, morphology, behaviour and ecology differ somewhat among species. However, they have many similarities in these areas as well. All crocodiles are semiaquatic and tend to congregate in freshwater habitats such as rivers, lakes, wetlands and sometimes in brackish water and saltwater. They are carnivorous animals, feeding mostly on vertebrates such as fish, reptiles, birds and mammals, and sometimes on invertebrates such as molluscs and crustaceans, depending on species and age. All crocodiles are tropical species that, unlike alligators, are very sensitive to cold. They separated from other crocodilians during the Eocene epoch, about 55 million years ago. Many species are at the risk of extinction, some being classified as critically endangered.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;crocodile&quot; comes , used in the phrase , . There are several variant Greek forms of the word attested, including the later form () found cited in many English reference works. In the Koine Greek of Roman times, and would have been pronounced identically, and either or both may be the source of the Latinized form used by the ancient Romans. It has been suggested, but it is not certain that the word or is a compound of (), and (), although is only attested as a colloquial term for . It is ascribed to Herodotus, and supposedly describes the basking habits of the Egyptian crocodile.

The form is attested in Medieval Latin. It is not clear whether this is a medieval corruption or derives from alternative Greco-Latin forms (late Greek and are attested). A (further) corrupted form is found in Old French and was borrowed into Middle English as . The Modern English form &quot;crocodile&quot; was adapted directly from the Classical Latin in the 16th century, replacing the earlier form. The use of &quot;-y-&quot; in the scientific name &quot;Crocodylus&quot; (and forms derived from it) is a corruption introduced by Laurenti (1768).

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==

Crocodylidae was named as a family by Georges Cuvier in 1807. It belongs to the larger superfamily Crocodyloidea, which also includes additional extinct crocodile relatives. These all belong to the order Crocodilia, which also includes alligators and gharials.

Crocodylidae is cladistically defined as a crown group composed of the last common ancestor of the Nile crocodile (&quot;Crocodylus niloticus&quot;), the Dwarf crocodile (&quot;Osteolaemus tetraspis&quot;), and all of its descendants. It contains two subfamilies: Crocodylinae and Osteolaeminae. Crocodylinae contains 13-14 living species, as well as 6 extinct species. Osteolaeminae was named by Christopher Brochu in 2003 as a subfamily of Crocodylidae separate from Crocodylinae, and contains the two extant genera &quot;Osteolaemus&quot; and &quot;Mecistops&quot;, along with several extinct genera. The number of extant species within Osteolaeminae is currently in question.

===Phylogeny===
Recent molecular studies using DNA sequencing have shown crocodiles to be more closely related to the gavialids rather than to alligators, contrary to prior theories based on morphological studies alone.

Below is a cladogram showing the relationships of the major extant crocodile groups based on molecular studies, excluding separate extinct taxa:
Below is a more detailed cladogram of Crocodylidae, based on a 2021 study using paleogenomics that extracted DNA from the extinct &quot;Voay&quot;.
Alternatively, some morphological studies have recovered &quot;Mecistops&quot; as a basal member of Crocodylinae, more closely related to &quot;Crocodylus&quot; than to &quot;Osteolaemus&quot; and the other members of Osteolaeminae, as shown in the cladogram below.
==Species==

A total of 18 extant species have been recognized. Further genetic study is needed for the confirmation of proposed species under the genus &quot;Osteolaemus&quot;.

==Characteristics==

A crocodile&#x27;s physical traits allow it to be a successful predator. Its external morphology is a sign of its aquatic and predatory lifestyle. Its streamlined body enables it to swim swiftly; it also tucks its feet to the side while swimming, making it faster by decreasing water resistance. Crocodiles have webbed feet which, though not used to propel them through the water, allow them to make fast turns and sudden moves in the water or initiate swimming. Webbed feet are an advantage in shallow water, where the animals sometimes move around by walking. Crocodiles have a palatal flap, a rigid tissue at the back of the mouth that blocks the entry of water. The palate has a special path from the nostril to the glottis that bypasses the mouth. The nostrils are closed during submergence.

Like other archosaurs, crocodilians are diapsid, although their post-temporal fenestrae are reduced. The walls of the braincase are bony but lack supratemporal and postfrontal bones. Their tongues are not free, but held in place by a membrane that limits movement; as a result, crocodiles are unable to stick out their tongues. Crocodiles have smooth skin on their bellies and sides, while their dorsal surfaces are armoured with large osteoderms. The armoured skin has scales and is thick and rugged, providing some protection. They are still able to absorb heat through this armour, as a network of small capillaries allows blood through the scales to absorb heat. The osteoderms are highly vascularised and aid in calcium balance, both to neutralize acids while the animal cannot breathe underwater and to provide calcium for eggshell formation. Crocodilian tegument have pores believed to be sensory in function, analogous to the lateral line in fishes. They are particularly seen on their upper and lower jaws. Another possibility is that they are secretory, as they produce an oily substance which appears to flush mud off.

===Size===

Size greatly varies among species, from the dwarf crocodile to the saltwater crocodile. Species of the dwarf crocodile &quot;Osteolaemus&quot; grow to an adult size of just , whereas the saltwater crocodile can grow to sizes over and weigh over . Several other large species can reach over long and weigh over . Crocodilians show pronounced sexual dimorphism, with males growing much larger and more rapidly than females. Despite their large adult sizes, crocodiles start their lives at around long. The largest species of crocodile is the saltwater crocodile, found in eastern India, northern Australia, throughout South-east Asia, and in the surrounding waters.

The brain volume of two adult crocodiles was 5.6 cm3 for a spectacled caiman and 8.5 cm3 for a larger Nile crocodile.

The largest crocodile ever held in captivity is a saltwater–Siamese hybrid named Yai (, meaning big; born 10 June 1972) at the Samutprakarn Crocodile Farm and Zoo, Thailand. This animal measures in length and weighs .

The longest crocodile captured alive was Lolong, a saltwater crocodile which was measured at and weighed at by a National Geographic team in Agusan del Sur Province, Philippines.

===Teeth===
Crocodiles are polyphyodonts; they are able to replace each of their 80 teeth up to 50 times in their 35- to 75-year lifespan. Next to each full-grown tooth, there is a small replacement tooth and an odontogenic stem cell in the dental lamina in standby that can be activated if required.

==Biology and behaviour==

Crocodilians are more closely related to birds and dinosaurs than to most animals classified as reptiles, the three families being included in the group Archosauria (&#x27;ruling reptiles&#x27;). Despite their prehistoric look, crocodiles are among the more biologically complex reptiles. Unlike other reptiles, a crocodile has a cerebral cortex and a four-chambered heart. Crocodilians also have the functional equivalent of a diaphragm by incorporating muscles used for aquatic locomotion into respiration. Salt glands are present in the tongues of crocodiles and they have a pore opening on the surface of the tongue, a trait that separates them from alligators. Salt glands are dysfunctional in Alligatoridae. Their function appears to be similar to that of salt glands in marine turtles. Crocodiles do not have sweat glands and release heat through their mouths. They often sleep with their mouths open and may pant like a dog. Four species of freshwater crocodile climb trees to bask in areas lacking a shoreline.

===Senses===

Crocodiles have acute senses, an evolutionary advantage that makes them successful predators. The eyes, ears and nostrils are located on top of the head, allowing the crocodile to lie low in the water, almost totally submerged and hidden from prey.

====Vision====
Crocodiles have very good night vision, and are mostly nocturnal hunters. They use the disadvantage of most prey animals&#x27; poor nocturnal vision to their advantage. The light receptors in crocodilians&#x27; eyes include cones and numerous rods, so it is assumed all crocodilians can see colours. Crocodiles have vertical-slit shaped pupils, similar to those of domestic cats. One explanation for the evolution of slit pupils is that they exclude light more effectively than a circular pupil, helping to protect the eyes during daylight. On the rear wall of the eye is a tapetum lucidum, which reflects incoming light back onto the retina, thus utilizing the small amount of light available at night to best advantage. In addition to the protection of the upper and lower eyelids, crocodiles have a nictitating membrane (sometimes called a &quot;third eye-lid&quot;) that can be drawn over the eye from the inner corner while the lids are open. The eyeball surface is thus protected under the water while a certain degree of vision is still possible.

====Olfaction====
Crocodilian sense of smell is also very well developed, aiding them to detect prey or animal carcasses that are either on land or in water, from far away. It is possible that crocodiles use olfaction in the egg prior to hatching.

Chemoreception in crocodiles is especially interesting because they hunt in both terrestrial and aquatic surroundings. Crocodiles have only one olfactory chamber and the vomeronasal organ is absent in the adults indicating all olfactory perception is limited to the olfactory system. Behavioural and olfactometer experiments indicate that crocodiles detect both air-borne and water-soluble chemicals and use their olfactory system for hunting. When above water, crocodiles enhance their ability to detect volatile odorants by gular pumping, a rhythmic movement of the floor of the pharynx. Crocodiles close their nostrils when submerged, so olfaction underwater is unlikely. Underwater food detection is presumably gustatory and tactile.

====Hearing====
Crocodiles can hear well; their tympanic membranes are concealed by flat flaps that may be raised or lowered by muscles.

====Touch====
The touch sensors, concentrated in crocodile skin, can be thicker than those in human fingerprints. Crocodiles can feel the touch on their skin.

Cranial: The upper and lower jaws are covered with sensory pits, visible as small, black speckles on the skin, the crocodilian version of the lateral line organs seen in fish and many amphibians, though arising from a completely different origin. These pigmented nodules encase bundles of nerve fibers innervated beneath by branches of the trigeminal nerve. They respond to the slightest disturbance in surface water, detecting vibrations and small pressure changes as small as a single drop. This makes it possible for crocodiles to detect prey, danger and intruders, even in total darkness. These sense organs are known as domed pressure receptors (DPRs).

Post-Cranial: While alligators and caimans have DPRs only on their jaws, crocodiles have similar organs on almost every scale on their bodies. The function of the DPRs on the jaws is clear; to catch prey, but it is still not clear what the function is of the organs on the rest of the body. The receptors flatten when exposed to increased osmotic pressure, such as that experienced when swimming in sea water hyperosmotic to the body fluids. When contact between the integument and the surrounding sea water solution is blocked, crocodiles are found to lose their ability to discriminate salinities. It has been proposed that the flattening of the sensory organ in hyperosmotic sea water is sensed by the animal as &quot;touch&quot;, but interpreted as chemical information about its surroundings. This might be why in alligators they are absent on the rest of the body.

===Hunting and diet===

Crocodiles are ambush predators, waiting for fish or land animals to come close, then rushing out to attack. Crocodiles mostly eat fish, amphibians, crustaceans, molluscs, birds, reptiles, and mammals, and they occasionally cannibalize smaller crocodiles. What a crocodile eats varies greatly with species, size and age. From the mostly fish-eating species, like the slender-snouted and freshwater crocodiles, to the larger species like the Nile crocodile and the saltwater crocodile that prey on large mammals, such as buffalo, deer and wild boar, diet shows great diversity. Diet is also greatly affected by the size and age of the individual within the same species. All young crocodiles hunt mostly invertebrates and small fish, gradually moving on to larger prey. Being ectothermic (cold-blooded) predators, they have a very slow metabolism, so they can survive long periods without food. Despite their appearance of being slow, crocodiles have a very fast strike and are top predators in their environment, and various species have been observed attacking and killing other predators such as sharks and big cats. Crocodiles are also known to be aggressive scavengers who feed upon carrion and steal from other predators. Evidence suggests that crocodiles also feed upon fruits, based on the discovery of seeds in stools and stomachs from many subjects as well as accounts of them feeding.

Crocodiles have the most acidic stomach of any vertebrate. They can easily digest bones, hooves and horns. The BBC TV reported that a Nile crocodile that has lurked a long time underwater to catch prey builds up a large oxygen debt. When it has caught and eaten that prey, it closes its right aortic arch and uses its left aortic arch to flush blood loaded with carbon dioxide from its muscles directly to its stomach; the resulting excess acidity in its blood supply makes it much easier for the stomach lining to secrete more stomach acid to quickly dissolve bulks of swallowed prey flesh and bone. Many large crocodilians swallow stones (called gastroliths or stomach stones), which may act as ballast to balance their bodies or assist in crushing food, similar to grit ingested by birds. Herodotus claimed that Nile crocodiles had a symbiotic relationship with certain birds, such as the Egyptian plover, which enter the crocodile&#x27;s mouth and pick leeches feeding on the crocodile&#x27;s blood; with no evidence of this interaction actually occurring in any crocodile species, it is most likely mythical or allegorical fiction.

====Bite====

Since they feed by grabbing and holding onto their prey, they have evolved sharp teeth for piercing and holding onto flesh, and powerful muscles to close the jaws and hold them shut. The teeth are not well-suited to tearing flesh off of large prey items as are the dentition and claws of many mammalian carnivores, the hooked bills and talons of raptorial birds, or the serrated teeth of sharks. However, this is an advantage rather than a disadvantage to the crocodile since the properties of the teeth allow it to hold onto prey with the least possibility of the prey animal escaping. Cutting teeth, combined with the exceptionally high bite force, would pass through flesh easily enough to leave an escape opportunity for prey. The jaws can bite down with immense force, by far the strongest bite of any animal. The force of a large crocodile&#x27;s bite is more than , which was measured in a Nile crocodile, in the field; comparing to for a Rottweiler, for a hyena, for an American alligator, and for the largest confirmed great white shark.

A long saltwater crocodile has been confirmed as having the strongest bite force ever recorded for an animal in a laboratory setting. It was able to apply a bite force value of , and thus surpassed the previous record of made by a long American alligator. Taking the measurements of several crocodiles as reference, the bite forces of 6-m individuals were estimated at . The study, led by Dr. Gregory M. Erickson, also shed light on the larger, extinct species of crocodilians. Since crocodile anatomy has changed only slightly over the last 80 million years, current data on modern crocodilians can be used to estimate the bite force of extinct species. An Deinosuchus would apply a force of , nearly twice that of the latest, higher bite force estimations of Tyrannosaurus (). The extraordinary bite of crocodilians is a result of their anatomy. The space for the jaw muscle in the skull is very large, which is easily visible from the outside as a bulge at each side. The muscle is so stiff, it is almost as hard as bone to touch, as if it were the continuum of the skull. Another trait is that most of the muscle in a crocodile&#x27;s jaw is arranged for clamping down. Despite the strong muscles to close the jaw, crocodiles have extremely small and weak muscles to open the jaw. Crocodiles can thus be subdued for study or transport by taping their jaws or holding their jaws shut with large rubber bands cut from automobile inner tubes.

===Locomotion===

Crocodiles can move quickly over short distances, even out of water. The land speed record for a crocodile is measured in a galloping Australian freshwater crocodile. Maximum speed varies between species. Some species can gallop, including Cuban crocodiles, Johnston&#x27;s crocodiles, New Guinea crocodiles, African dwarf crocodiles, and even small Nile crocodiles. The fastest means by which most species can move is a &quot;belly run&quot;, in which the body moves in a snake-like (sinusoidal) fashion, limbs splayed out to either side paddling away frantically while the tail whips to and fro. Crocodiles can reach speeds of when they &quot;belly run&quot;, and often faster if slipping down muddy riverbanks. When a crocodile walks quickly, it holds its legs in a straighter and more upright position under its body, which is called the &quot;high walk&quot;. This walk allows a speed of up to 5 km/h.

Crocodiles may possess a homing instinct. In northern Australia, three rogue saltwater crocodiles were relocated by helicopter, but returned to their original locations within three weeks, based on data obtained from tracking devices attached to them.

===Longevity===
Measuring crocodile age is unreliable, although several techniques are used to derive a reasonable guess. The most common method is to measure lamellar growth rings in bones and teeth—each ring corresponds to a change in growth rate which typically occurs once a year between dry and wet seasons. Bearing these inaccuracies in mind, it can be safely said that all crocodile species have an average lifespan of at least 30–40 years, and in the case of larger species an average of 60–70 years. The oldest crocodiles appear to be the largest species. &quot;C. porosus&quot; is estimated to live around 70 years on average, with limited evidence of some individuals exceeding 100 years.

In captivity, some individuals are claimed to have lived for over a century. A male crocodile lived to an estimated age of 110–115 years in a Russian zoo in Yekaterinburg. Named Kolya, he joined the zoo around 1913 to 1915, fully grown, after touring in an animal show, and lived until 1995. A male freshwater crocodile lived to an estimated age of 120–140 years at the Australia Zoo. Known affectionately as &quot;Mr. Freshie&quot;, he was rescued around 1970 by Bob Irwin and Steve Irwin, after being shot twice by hunters and losing an eye as a result, and lived until 2010. Crocworld Conservation Centre, in Scottburgh, South Africa, claims to have a male Nile crocodile that was born in 1900. Named Henry, the crocodile is said to have lived in Botswana along the Okavango River, according to centre director Martin Rodrigues.

===Social behaviour and vocalization===

Crocodiles are the most social of reptiles. Even though they do not form social groups, many species congregate in certain sections of rivers, tolerating each other at times of feeding and basking. Most species are not highly territorial, with the exception of the saltwater crocodile, which is a highly territorial and aggressive species: a mature, male saltwater crocodile will not tolerate any other males at any time of the year, but most other species are more flexible. There is a certain form of hierarchy in crocodiles: the largest and heaviest males are at the top, having access to the best basking site, while females are priority during a group feeding of a big kill or carcass. A good example of the hierarchy in crocodiles would be the case of the Nile crocodile. This species clearly displays all of these behaviours. Studies in this area are not thorough, however, and many species are yet to be studied in greater detail. Mugger crocodiles are also known to show toleration in group feedings and tend to congregate in certain areas. However, males of all species are aggressive towards each other during mating season, to gain access to females.

Crocodiles are also the most vocal of all reptiles, producing a wide variety of sounds during various situations and conditions, depending on species, age, size and sex. Depending on the context, some species can communicate over 20 different messages through vocalizations alone. Some of these vocalizations are made during social communication, especially during territorial displays towards the same sex and courtship with the opposite sex; the common concern being reproduction. Therefore most conspecific vocalization is made during the breeding season, with the exception being year-round territorial behaviour in some species and quarrels during feeding. Crocodiles also produce different distress calls and in aggressive displays to their own kind and other animals; notably other predators during interspecific predatory confrontations over carcasses and terrestrial kills.

Specific vocalisations include —

* Chirp: When about to hatch, the young make a &quot;peeping&quot; noise, which encourages the female to excavate the nest. The female then gathers the hatchlings in her mouth and transports them to the water, where they remain in a group for several months, protected by the female
* Distress call: A high-pitched call used mostly by younger animals to alert other crocodiles to imminent danger or an animal being attacked.
* Threat call: A hissing sound that has also been described as a coughing noise.
* Hatching call: Emitted by a female when breeding to alert other crocodiles that she has laid eggs in her nest.
* Bellowing: Male crocodiles are especially vociferous. Bellowing choruses occur most often in the spring when breeding groups congregate, but can occur at any time of year. To bellow, males noticeably inflate as they raise the tail and head out of water, slowly waving the tail back and forth. They then puff out the throat and with a closed mouth, begin to vibrate air. Just before bellowing, males project an infrasonic signal at about 10 Hz through the water, which vibrates the ground and nearby objects. These low-frequency vibrations travel great distances through both air and water to advertise the male&#x27;s presence and are so powerful they result in the water&#x27;s appearing to &quot;dance&quot;.

===Reproduction===

Crocodiles lay eggs, which are laid in either holes or mound nests, depending on species. A hole nest is usually excavated in sand and a mound nest is usually constructed out of vegetation. Nesting periods range from a few weeks up to six months. Courtship takes place in a series of behavioural interactions that include a variety of snout rubbing and submissive display that can take a long time. Mating always takes place in water, where the pair can be observed mating several times. Females can build or dig several trial nests which appear incomplete and abandoned later. Egg-laying usually takes place at night and about 30–40 minutes. Females are highly protective of their nests and young. The eggs are hard shelled, but translucent at the time of egg-laying. Depending on the species of crocodile, 7 to 95 eggs are laid. Crocodile embryos do not have sex chromosomes, and unlike humans, sex is not determined genetically. Sex is determined by temperature, where at or less most hatchlings are females and at , offspring are of both sexes. A temperature of gives mostly males whereas above in some species continues to give males, but in other species resulting in females, which are sometimes called high-temperature females. Temperature also affects growth and survival rate of the young, which may explain the sexual dimorphism in crocodiles. The average incubation period is around 80 days, and also is dependent on temperature and species that usually ranges from 65 to 95 days. The eggshell structure is very conservative through evolution but there are enough changes to tell different species apart by their eggshell microstructure. Scutes may play a role in calcium storage for eggshell formation.

At the time of hatching, the young start calling within the eggs. They have an egg-tooth at the tip of their snouts, which is developed from the skin, and that helps them pierce out of the shell. Hearing the calls, the female usually excavates the nest and sometimes takes the unhatched eggs in her mouth, slowly rolling the eggs to help the process. The young is usually carried to the water in the mouth. She would then introduce her hatchlings to the water and even feed them. The mother would then take care of her young for over a year before the next mating season. In the absence of the mother crocodile, the father would act in her place to take care of the young. However, even with a sophisticated parental nurturing, young crocodiles have a very high mortality rate due to their vulnerability to predation. A group of hatchlings is called a pod or crèche and may be protected for months.

===Cognition===
Crocodiles possess some advanced cognitive abilities. They can observe and use patterns of prey behaviour, such as when prey come to the river to drink at the same time each day. Vladimir Dinets of the University of Tennessee, observed that crocodiles use twigs as bait for birds looking for nesting material. They place sticks on their snouts and partly submerge themselves. When the birds swooped in to get the sticks, the crocodiles then catch the birds. Crocodiles only do this in spring nesting seasons of the birds, when there is high demand for sticks to be used for building nests. Vladimir also discovered other similar observations from various scientists, some dating back to the 19th century. Aside from using sticks, crocodiles are also capable of cooperative hunting. Large numbers of crocodiles swim in circles to trap fish and take turns snatching them. In hunting larger prey, crocodiles swarm in, with one holding the prey down as the others rip it apart.

According to a 2015 study, crocodiles engage in all three main types of play behaviour recorded in animals: locomotor play, play with objects and social play. Play with objects is reported most often, but locomotor play such as repeatedly sliding down slopes, and social play such as riding on the backs of other crocodiles is also reported. This behaviour was exhibited with conspecifics and mammals and is apparently not uncommon, though has been difficult to observe and interpret in the past due to obvious dangers of interacting with large carnivores.

==Relationship with humans==
===Danger to humans===
The larger species of crocodiles are very dangerous to humans, mainly because of their ability to strike before the person can react. The saltwater crocodile and Nile crocodile are the most dangerous, killing hundreds of people each year in parts of Southeast Asia and Africa. The mugger crocodile and American crocodile are also dangerous to humans.

===Crocodile products===

Crocodiles are protected in many parts of the world, but are also farmed commercially. Their hides are tanned and used to make leather goods such as shoes and handbags; crocodile meat is also considered a delicacy. The most commonly farmed species are the saltwater and Nile crocodiles, while a hybrid of the saltwater and the rare Siamese crocodile is also bred in Asian farms. Farming has resulted in an increase in the saltwater crocodile population in Australia, as eggs are usually harvested from the wild, so landowners have an incentive to conserve their habitat. Crocodile leather can be made into goods such as wallets, briefcases, purses, handbags, belts, hats, and shoes. Crocodile oil has been used for various purposes. Crocodiles were eaten by Vietnamese while they were taboo and off limits for Chinese. Vietnamese women who married Chinese men adopted the Chinese taboo.

Crocodile meat is consumed in some countries, such as Australia, Ethiopia, Thailand, South Africa, China, and Cuba (in pickled form). It is also occasionally eaten as an &quot;exotic&quot; delicacy in the western world. Cuts of meat include backstrap and tail fillet.

Due to high demand for crocodile products, TRAFFIC states that 1,418,487 Nile Crocodile skins were exported from Africa between 2006 and 2015.

===Crocodile hunting and conservation===

Aboriginal Australians harvested eggs and hunted crocodiles in a sustainable way for many thousands of years. The Brinkin people (aka Marrithiyal) of the Daly River in the Northern Territory (NT) used harpoons and bamboo, and even their own hands to capture crocodiles for food. After settlement of northern Australia, in the late-19th and early 20th centuries, non-Indigenous people killed individual crocodiles, mostly by locals to protect the population, or novelty-seeking visitors, or just opportunistically, so numbers were not noticeably reduced. From the 1930s, commercial hunting began, with Aboriginal people often employed to kill the crocodiles using traditional methods. From the 1940s to the 1960s, hunting began on a larger scale using .303 rifles. They were hunted for leather, with the skins shipped to plants in capital cities. Western Australia banned hunting freshwater crocodiles in 1962 and saltwater crocodiles in 1970, while NT bans were brought in 1964 and 1971; Queensland did not pass such legislation. The federal government later banned the export of crocodile skins, which brought commercial hunting to an end in Queensland. They have been a protected species since the 1970s, when numbers were down to approximately 3,000 in the NT at the lowest estimate. In 2021, after several attacks on humans by the &quot;salties&quot; and an estimated population of around 200,000 had been reached, Queensland politician Bob Katter called for the reintroduction of hunting.

===In religion and mythology===

Crocodiles have appeared in various forms in religions across the world. Ancient Egypt had Sobek, the crocodile-headed god, with his cult-city Crocodilopolis, as well as Taweret, the goddess of childbirth and fertility, with the back and tail of a crocodile. The Jukun shrine in the Wukari Federation, Nigeria is dedicated to crocodiles in thanks for their aid during migration. In Madagascar various peoples such as the Sakalava and Antandroy see crocodiles as ancestor spirits and under local &quot;fady&quot; often offer them food; in the case of the latter at least a crocodile features prominently as an ancestor deity.

Crocodiles appear in different forms in Hinduism. Varuna, a Vedic and Hindu god, rides a part-crocodile makara; his consort Varuni rides a crocodile. Similarly the goddess personifications of the Ganga and Yamuna rivers are often depicted as riding crocodiles. Also in India, in Goa, crocodile worship is practised, including the annual &quot;Mannge Thapnee&quot; ceremony.

Sikh warriors known as nihang also have connections with crocodiles. &quot;Nihang&quot; may come from the Persian word for a mythical sea creature (). The term owes its origin to Mughal historians, who compared the ferocity of the Akali with that of crocodiles. The meaning of Akali in Sikhism however, is the immortal army of Akal (god).

In Latin America, Cipactli was the giant earth crocodile of the Aztec and other Nahua peoples.

The name of Surabaya, Indonesia, is locally believed to be derived from the words &quot;suro&quot; (shark) and &quot;boyo&quot; (crocodile), two creatures which, in a local myth, fought each other in order to gain the title of &quot;the strongest and most powerful animal&quot; in the area. It was said that the two powerful animals agreed for a truce and set boundaries; that the shark&#x27;s domain would be in the sea while the crocodile&#x27;s domain would be on the land. However one day the shark swam into the river estuary to hunt, this angered the crocodile, who declared it his territory. The Shark argued that the river was a water-realm which meant that it was shark territory, while the crocodile argued that the river flowed deep inland, so it was therefore crocodile territory. A ferocious fight resumed as the two animals bit each other. Finally the shark was badly bitten and fled to the open sea, and the crocodile finally ruled the estuarine area that today is the city. Another source alludes to a Jayabaya prophecy—a 12th-century psychic king of Kediri Kingdom—as he foresaw a fight between a giant white shark and a giant white crocodile taking place in the area, which is sometimes interpreted as a foretelling of the Mongol invasion of Java, a major conflict between the forces of the Kublai Khan, Mongol ruler of China, and those of Raden Wijaya&#x27;s Majapahit in 1293. The two animals are now used as the city&#x27;s symbol, with the two facing and circling each other, as depicted in a statue appropriately located near the entrance to the city zoo (see photo on the Surabaya page).

===In language and as symbols===

The term &quot;crocodile tears&quot; (and equivalents in other languages) refers to a false, insincere display of emotion, such as a hypocrite crying fake tears of grief. It is derived from an ancient anecdote that crocodiles weep in order to lure their prey, or that they cry for the victims they are eating, first told in the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; by Photios I of Constantinople. The story is repeated in bestiaries such as &quot;De bestiis et aliis rebus&quot;. This tale was first spread widely in English in the stories of the &quot;Travels of Sir John Mandeville&quot; in the 14th century, and appears in several of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. In fact, crocodiles can and do generate tears, but they do not actually cry.

In the UK, a row of schoolchildren walking in pairs, or two by two is known as &quot;crocodile&quot;.

===Fashion logos===
The French clothing company Lacoste features a crocodile in its logo. The American shoe company Crocs also uses this imagery in its logo.

<doc id="37885" wikidata="Q318455" url="?curid=37885" title="Falstaff (opera)">
<text>Falstaff () is a comic opera in three acts by the Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi. The Italian-language libretto was adapted by Arrigo Boito from the play &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; and scenes from &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; and &quot;Part 2&quot;, by William Shakespeare. The work premiered on 9 February 1893 at La Scala, Milan.

Verdi wrote &quot;Falstaff&quot;, the last of his 26 operas, as he approached the age of 80. It was his second comedy, and his third work based on a Shakespeare play, following &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;Otello&quot;. The plot revolves around the thwarted, sometimes farcical, efforts of the fat knight Sir John Falstaff to seduce two married women to gain access to their husbands&#x27; wealth.

Verdi was concerned about working on a new opera at his advanced age, but he yearned to write a comic work and was pleased with Boito&#x27;s draft libretto. It took the collaborators three years from mid-1889 to complete. Although the prospect of a new opera from Verdi aroused immense interest in Italy and around the world, &quot;Falstaff&quot; did not prove to be as popular as earlier works in the composer&#x27;s canon. After the initial performances in Italy, other European countries and the US, the work was neglected until the conductor Arturo Toscanini insisted on its revival at La Scala and the Metropolitan Opera in New York from the late 1890s into the next century. Some felt that the piece suffered from a lack of the full-blooded melodies of the best of Verdi&#x27;s previous operas, a view that Toscanini strongly opposed. Conductors of the generation after Toscanini who championed the work included Herbert von Karajan, Georg Solti and Leonard Bernstein. The work is now part of the standard operatic repertory.

Verdi made numerous changes to the music after the first performance, and editors have found difficulty in agreeing on a definitive score. The work was first recorded in 1932 and has subsequently received many studio and live recordings. Singers closely associated with the title role have included Victor Maurel (the first Falstaff), Mariano Stabile, Giuseppe Valdengo, Tito Gobbi, Geraint Evans, Bryn Terfel and Ambrogio Maestri.

==Composition history==

===Conception===
By 1889 Verdi had been an opera composer for more than fifty years. He had written 27 operas, of which only one was a comedy, his second work, &quot;Un giorno di regno&quot;, staged unsuccessfully in 1840. His fellow composer Rossini commented that he admired Verdi greatly, but thought him incapable of writing a comedy. Verdi disagreed and said that he longed to write another light-hearted opera, but nobody would give him the chance. He had included moments of comedy even in his tragic operas, for example in &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; and &quot;La forza del destino&quot;.

For a comic subject Verdi considered Cervantes&#x27; &quot;Don Quixote&quot; and plays by Goldoni, Molière and Labiche, but found none of them wholly suitable. The singer Victor Maurel sent him a French libretto based on Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;. Verdi liked it, but replied that &quot;to deal with it properly you need a Rossini or a Donizetti&quot;. Following the success of &quot;Otello&quot; in 1887 he commented, &quot;After having relentlessly massacred so many heroes and heroines, I have at last the right to laugh a little.&quot; He confided his ambition to the librettist of &quot;Otello&quot;, Arrigo Boito. Boito said nothing at the time, but he secretly began work on a libretto based on &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; with additional material taken from &quot;Henry IV&quot;, parts 1 and 2. Many composers had set the play to music, with little success, among them Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf (1796), Antonio Salieri (1799), Michael William Balfe (1835) and Adolphe Adam (1856). The first version to secure a place in the operatic repertoire was Otto Nicolai&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; in 1849, but its success was largely confined to German opera houses.

Boito was doubly pleased with &quot;The Merry Wives&quot; as a plot. Not only was it Shakespearian, it was based in part on Trecento Italian works – &quot;Il Pecorone&quot; by Ser Giovanni Fiorentino, and Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot;. Boito adopted a deliberately archaic form of Italian to &quot;lead Shakespeare&#x27;s farce back to its clear Tuscan source&quot;, as he put it. He trimmed the plot, halved the number of characters in the play, and gave the character of Falstaff more depth by incorporating dozens of passages from &quot;Henry IV&quot;.

Verdi received the draft libretto a few weeks later, by early July 1889, at a time when his interest had been piqued by reading Shakespeare&#x27;s play: &quot;Benissimo! Benissimo! ... No one could have done better than you&quot;, he wrote back. Like Boito, Verdi loved and revered Shakespeare. The composer did not speak English, but he owned and frequently re-read Shakespeare&#x27;s plays in Italian translations by Carlo Rusconi and , which he kept by his bedside. He had earlier set operatic adaptations of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; (in 1847) and &quot;Othello&quot; (in 1887) and had considered &quot;King Lear&quot; as a subject; Boito had suggested &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;.
Verdi still had doubts, and on the next day sent another letter to Boito expressing his concerns. He wrote of &quot;the large number of years&quot; in his age, his health (which he admitted was still good) and his ability to complete the project: &quot;if I were not to finish the music?&quot; He said that the project could all be a waste of the younger man&#x27;s time and distract Boito from completing his own new opera (which became &quot;Nerone&quot;). Yet, as his biographer Mary Jane Phillips-Matz notes, &quot;Verdi could not hide his delight at the idea of writing another opera&quot;. On 10 July 1889 he wrote again:
===Composition===
Boito&#x27;s original sketch is lost, but surviving correspondence shows that the finished opera is not greatly different from his first thoughts. The major differences were that an act 2 monologue for Ford was moved from scene 2 to scene 1, and that the last act originally ended with the marriage of the lovers rather than with the lively vocal and orchestral fugue, which was Verdi&#x27;s idea. He wrote to Boito in August 1889 telling him that he was writing a fugue: &quot;Yes, Sir! A fugue... and a &quot;buffa&quot; fugue&quot;, which &quot;could probably be fitted in&quot;.
Verdi accepted the need to trim Shakespeare&#x27;s plot to keep the opera within an acceptable length. He was sorry, nonetheless, to see the loss of Falstaff&#x27;s second humiliation, dressed up as the Wise Woman of Brentford to escape from Ford. He wrote of his desire to do justice to Shakespeare: &quot;To sketch the characters in a few strokes, to weave the plot, to extract all the juice from that enormous Shakespearian orange&quot;. Shortly after the premiere an English critic, R A Streatfeild, remarked on how Verdi succeeded:
In November Boito took the completed first act to Verdi at Sant&#x27;Agata, along with the second act, which was still under construction: &quot;That act has the devil on its back; and when you touch it, it burns&quot;, Boito complained. They worked on the opera for a week, then Verdi and his wife Giuseppina Strepponi went to Genoa. No more work was done for some time.

The writer Russ McDonald observes that a letter from Boito to Verdi touches on the musical techniques used in the opera – he wrote of how to portray the characters Nannetta and Fenton: &quot;I can&#x27;t quite explain it: I would like as one sprinkles sugar on a tart to sprinkle the whole comedy with that happy love without concentrating it at any one point.&quot;

The first act was completed by March 1890; the rest of the opera was not composed in chronological order, as had been Verdi&#x27;s usual practice. The musicologist Roger Parker comments that this piecemeal approach may have been &quot;an indication of the relative independence of individual scenes&quot;. Progress was slow, with composition &quot;carried out in short bursts of activity interspersed with long fallow periods&quot; partly caused by the composer&#x27;s depression. Verdi was weighed down by the fear of being unable to complete the score, and also by the deaths and impending deaths of close friends, including the conductors Franco Faccio and Emanuele Muzio. There was no pressure on the composer to hurry. As he observed at the time, he was not working on a commission from a particular opera house, as he had in the past, but was composing for his own pleasure: &quot;in writing &quot;Falstaff&quot;, I haven&#x27;t thought about either theatres or singers&quot;. He reiterated this idea in December 1890, a time when his spirits were very low after Muzio&#x27;s death that November: &quot;Will I finish it [Falstaff]? Or will I not finish it? Who knows! I am writing without any aim, without a goal, just to pass a few hours of the day&quot;. By early 1891 he was declaring that he could not finish the work that year, but in May he expressed some small optimism, which by mid-June, had turned into:

Boito was overjoyed, and Verdi reported that he was still working on the opera. The two men met in October or November 1891, after which the Verdis were in Genoa for the winter. They were both taken ill there, and two months of work were lost. By mid-April 1892 the scoring of the first act was complete and by June–July Verdi was considering potential singers for roles in &quot;Falstaff&quot;. For the title role he wanted Victor Maurel, the baritone who had sung Iago in &quot;Otello&quot;, but at first the singer sought contractual terms that Verdi found unacceptable: &quot;His demands were so outrageous, exorbitant, [and] incredible that there was nothing else to do but stop the entire project&quot;. Eventually they reached agreement and Maurel was cast.

By September Verdi had agreed in a letter to his publisher Casa Ricordi that La Scala could present the premiere during the 1892–93 season, but that he would retain control over every aspect of the production. An early February date was mentioned along with the demand that the house would be available exclusively after 2 January 1893 and that, even after the dress rehearsal, he could withdraw the opera: &quot;I will leave the theatre, and [Ricordi] will have to take the score away&quot;. The public learned of the new opera towards the end of 1892, and intense interest was aroused, increased rather than diminished by the secrecy with which Verdi surrounded the preparations; rehearsals were in private, and the press was kept at arm&#x27;s length. Apart from Verdi&#x27;s outrage at the way that La Scala announced the season&#x27;s programme on 7 December – &quot;either a revival of &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; or &quot;Falstaff&quot;&quot; – things went smoothly in January 1893 up to the premiere performance on 9 February.

==Performance history==
===Premieres===
The first performance of &quot;Falstaff&quot; was at La Scala in Milan on 9 February 1893, nearly six years after Verdi&#x27;s previous premiere. For the first night, official ticket prices were thirty times greater than usual. Royalty, aristocracy, critics and leading figures from the arts all over Europe were present. The performance was a huge success under the baton of Edoardo Mascheroni; numbers were encored, and at the end the applause for Verdi and the cast lasted an hour. That was followed by a tumultuous welcome when the composer, his wife and Boito arrived at the Grand Hotel de Milan.

Over the next two months the work was given twenty-two performances in Milan and then taken by the original company, led by Maurel, to Genoa, Rome, Venice, Trieste, Vienna and, without Maurel, to Berlin. Verdi and his wife left Milan on 2 March; Ricordi encouraged the composer to go to the planned Rome performance of 14 April, to maintain the momentum and excitement that the opera had generated. The Verdis, along with Boito and Giulio Ricordi, attended together with King Umberto I and other major royal and political figures of the day. The king introduced Verdi to the audience from the Royal Box to great acclaim, &quot;a national recognition and apotheosis of Verdi that had never been tendered him before&quot;, notes Phillips-Matz.

During these early performances Verdi made substantial changes to the score. For some of these he altered his manuscript, but for others musicologists have had to rely on the numerous full and piano scores put out by Ricordi. Further changes were made for the Paris premiere in 1894, which are also inadequately documented. Ricordi attempted to keep up with the changes, issuing new edition after new edition, but the orchestral and piano scores were often mutually contradictory. The Verdi scholar James Hepokoski considers that a definitive score of the opera is impossible, leaving companies and conductors to choose between a variety of options. In a 2013 study Philip Gossett disagrees, believing that the autograph is essentially a reliable source, augmented by contemporary Ricordi editions for the few passages that Verdi omitted to amend in his own score.

The first performances outside the Kingdom of Italy were in Trieste and Vienna, in May 1893. The work was given in the Americas and across Europe. The Berlin premiere of 1893 so excited Ferruccio Busoni that he drafted a letter to Verdi, in which he addressed him as &quot;Italy&#x27;s leading composer&quot; and &quot;one of the noblest persons of our time&quot;, and in which he explained that &quot;&quot;Falstaff&quot; provoked in me such a revolution of spirit that I can ... date [to the experience] the beginning of a new epoch in my artistic life.&quot; Antonio Scotti played the title role in Buenos Aires in July 1893; Gustav Mahler conducted the opera in Hamburg in January 1894; a Russian translation was presented in St Petersburg in the same month. Paris was regarded by many as the operatic capital of Europe, and for the production there in April 1894 Boito, who was fluent in French, made his own translation with the help of the Parisian poet Paul Solanges. This translation, approved by Verdi, is quite free in its rendering of Boito&#x27;s original Italian text. Boito was content to delegate the English and German translations to William Beatty-Kingston and Max Kalbeck respectively. The London premiere, sung in Italian, was at Covent Garden on 19 May 1894. The conductor was Luigi Mancinelli, and Zilli and Pini Corsi repeated their original roles. Falstaff was sung by Arturo Pessina; Maurel played the role at Covent Garden the following season. On 4 February 1895 the work was first presented at the Metropolitan Opera, New York; Mancinelli conducted and the cast included Maurel as Falstaff, Emma Eames as Alice, Zélie de Lussan as Nannetta and Sofia Scalchi as Mistress Quickly.

===Neglect===

After the initial excitement, audiences quickly diminished. Operagoers were nonplussed by the absence of big traditional arias and choruses. A contemporary critic summed it up: &quot;&#x27;Is this our Verdi?&#x27; they asked themselves. &#x27;But where is the &quot;motive&quot;; where are the broad melodies ... where are the usual &quot;ensembles&quot;; the &quot;finales&quot;?&#x27;&quot; By the time of Verdi&#x27;s death in 1901 the work had fallen out of the international repertoire, though Gustav Mahler, an admirer of Verdi, led a production of &quot;exceptional quality&quot; in 1904 at the Vienna Court Opera. The rising young conductor Arturo Toscanini was a strong advocate of the work, and did much to save it from neglect. As musical director of La Scala (from 1898) and the Metropolitan Opera (from 1908), he programmed &quot;Falstaff&quot; from the start of his tenure. Richard Aldrich, music critic of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote that Toscanini&#x27;s revival &quot;ought to be marked in red letters in the record of the season. &quot;Falstaff&quot;, which was first produced here on February 4, 1895, has not been given since the following season, and was heard in these two seasons only half a dozen times in all.&quot; Aldrich added that though the general public might have had difficulty with the work, &quot;to connoisseurs it was an unending delight&quot;.

In Britain, as in continental Europe and the US, the work fell out of the repertoire. Sir Thomas Beecham revived it in 1919, and recalling in his memoirs that the public had stayed away he commented:
Toscanini recognised that this was the view of many, but he believed the work to be Verdi&#x27;s greatest opera; he said, &quot;I believe it will take years and years before the general public understand this masterpiece, but when they really know it they will run to hear it like they do now for &quot;Rigoletto&quot; and &quot;La traviata&quot;.&quot;

===Re-emergence===

Toscanini returned to La Scala in 1921 and remained in charge there until 1929, presenting &quot;Falstaff&quot; in every season. He took the work to Germany and Austria in the late 1920s and the 1930s, conducting it in Vienna, Berlin and at three successive Salzburg Festivals. Among those inspired by Toscanini&#x27;s performances were Herbert von Karajan and Georg Solti, who were among his &quot;répétiteurs&quot; at Salzburg. Toscanini&#x27;s younger colleague Tullio Serafin continued to present the work in Germany and Austria after Toscanini refused to perform there because of his loathing of the Nazi regime.

When Karajan was in a position to do so he added &quot;Falstaff&quot; to the repertoire of his opera company at Aachen in 1941, and he remained a proponent of the work for the rest of his career, presenting it frequently in Vienna, Salzburg and elsewhere, and making audio and video recordings of it. Solti also became closely associated with &quot;Falstaff&quot;, as did Carlo Maria Giulini; they both conducted many performances of the work in mainland Europe, Britain and the US and made several recordings. Leonard Bernstein conducted the work at the Met and the Vienna State Opera, and on record. The advocacy of these and later conductors has given the work an assured place in the modern repertoire.

Among revivals in the 1950s and later, Hepokoski singles out as particularly notable the Glyndebourne productions with Fernando Corena and later Geraint Evans in the title role; three different stagings by Franco Zeffirelli, for the Holland Festival (1956), Covent Garden (1961) and the Metropolitan Opera (1964); and Luchino Visconti&#x27;s 1966 version in Vienna. A 1982 production by Ronald Eyre, more reflective and melancholy than usual, was staged in Los Angeles, London and Florence; Renato Bruson was Falstaff and Giulini conducted. Among more recent players of the title role Bryn Terfel has taken the part at Covent Garden in 1999, in a production by Graham Vick, conducted by Bernard Haitink. and at the Metropolitan Opera in a revival of the Zeffirelli production, conducted by James Levine in 2006.

Although &quot;Falstaff&quot; has become a regular repertoire work there nonetheless remains a view expressed by John von Rhein in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in 1985: &quot;&quot;Falstaff&quot; probably always will fall into the category of &#x27;connoisseur&#x27;s opera&#x27; rather than taking its place as a popular favorite on the order of &quot;La traviata&quot; or &quot;Aida.&quot;&quot;

==Roles==

==Synopsis==
:Time: The reign of Henry IV, 1399 to 1413

:Place: Windsor, England

===Act 1===

&quot;A room at the Garter Inn&quot;

Falstaff and his servants, Bardolfo and Pistola, are drinking at the inn. Dr Caius bursts in and accuses Falstaff of burgling his house and Bardolfo of picking his pocket. Falstaff laughs at him; he leaves, vowing only to go drinking with honest, sober companions in future. When the innkeeper presents a bill for the wine, Falstaff tells Bardolfo and Pistola that he needs more money, and plans to obtain it by seducing the wives of two rich men, one of whom is Ford. Falstaff hands Bardolfo a love-letter to one of the wives (Alice Ford), and hands Pistola an identical letter addressed to the other (Meg). Bardolfo and Pistola refuse to deliver the letters, claiming that honour prevents them from obeying him. Falstaff loses his temper and rants at them, saying that &quot;honour&quot; is nothing but a word, with no meaning (Monologue: &quot;L&#x27;onore! Ladri ... !&quot; / &quot;Honour! You rogues ... !&quot;) Brandishing a broom, he chases them out of his sight.

&quot;Ford&#x27;s garden&quot;

Alice and Meg have received Falstaff&#x27;s letters. They compare them, see that they are identical and, together with Mistress Quickly and Nannetta Ford, resolve to punish Falstaff. Meanwhile, Bardolfo and Pistola warn Ford of Falstaff&#x27;s plan. Ford resolves to disguise himself and visit Falstaff and set a trap for him.

A young, handsome fellow called Fenton is in love with Ford&#x27;s daughter Nannetta, but Ford wants her to marry Dr. Caius, who is wealthy and respected. Fenton and Nannetta enjoy a moment of privacy, but are interrupted by the return of Alice, Meg and Mistress Quickly. The act ends with an ensemble in which the women and the men separately plan revenge on Falstaff, the women gleefully anticipating an enjoyable prank, while the men angrily mutter dire threats.

===Act 2===
&quot;A room at the Garter Inn&quot;

Falstaff is alone at the inn. Bardolfo and Pistola, now in the pay of Ford, enter and beg Falstaff to allow them to re-enter his service, secretly planning to spy on him for Ford. Mistress Quickly enters and tells him that Alice is in love with him and will be alone in Ford&#x27;s home that afternoon, from two o&#x27;clock until three o&#x27;clock, just time for an amorous dalliance. Falstaff celebrates his potential success (&quot;Va, vecchio John&quot; / &quot;Go, old Jack, go your own way&quot;).

Ford arrives, masquerading as a wealthy stranger, using the false name &quot;Signor Fontana&quot;. He tells Falstaff that he is in love with Alice, but she is too virtuous to entertain him. He offers to pay Falstaff to use his impressive title and (alleged) charms to seduce her away from her virtuous convictions, after which he (&quot;Fontana&quot;) might have a better chance of seducing her himself. Falstaff, delighted at the prospect of being paid to seduce the wealthy and beautiful woman, agrees, and reveals that he already has a rendezvous arranged with Alice for two o&#x27;clock – the hour when Ford is always absent from home. Ford is consumed with jealousy, but conceals his feelings. Falstaff withdraws to a private room to change into his finest clothes, and Ford, left alone, reflects on the evil of an uncertain marriage and vows to have revenge (&quot;È sogno o realtà?&quot; / &quot;Is it a dream or reality?&quot;). When Falstaff returns in his finery, they leave together with elaborate displays of mutual courtesy.
&quot;A room in Ford&#x27;s house&quot;

The three women plot their strategy (&quot;Gaie Comari di Windsor&quot; / &quot;Merry wives of Windsor, the time has come!&quot;). Alice notices that Nannetta is too unhappy and anxious to share their gleeful anticipation. This is because Ford plans to marry her to Dr Caius, a man old enough to be her grandfather; the women reassure her that they will prevent it. Mistress Quickly announces Falstaff&#x27;s arrival, and Mistress Ford has a large laundry basket and a screen placed in readiness. Falstaff attempts to seduce Alice with tales of his past youth and glory (&quot;Quand&#x27;ero paggio del Duca di Norfolk&quot; / &quot;When I was page to the Duke of Norfolk I was slender&quot;). Mistress Quickly rushes in, shouting that Ford has returned home unexpectedly with a retinue of henchmen to catch his wife&#x27;s lover. Falstaff hides first behind the screen, but realizes that Ford will likely look for him there. The women urge him to hide in the laundry basket, which he does. In the meantime Fenton and Nannetta hide behind the screen for another moment of privacy. Ford and his men storm in and search for Falstaff, and hear the sound of Fenton and Nannetta kissing behind the screen. They assume it is Falstaff with Alice, but instead they find the young lovers. Ford orders Fenton to leave. Badly cramped and almost suffocating in the laundry hamper, Falstaff moans with discomfort while the men resume the search of the house. Alice orders her servants to throw the laundry basket through the window into the River Thames, where Falstaff endures the jeers of the crowd. Ford, seeing that Alice had never intended to betray him, smiles happily.

===Act 3===

&quot;Before the inn&quot;

Falstaff, cold and discouraged, glumly curses the sorry state of the world. Some mulled wine soon improves his mood. Mistress Quickly arrives and delivers another invitation to meet Alice. Falstaff at first wants nothing to do with it, but she persuades him. He is to meet Alice at midnight at Herne&#x27;s Oak in Windsor Great Park dressed up as the ghost of Herne the Hunter who, according to local superstition, haunts the area near the tree, and appears there at midnight with a band of supernatural spirits. He and Mistress Quickly go inside the inn. Ford has realized his error in suspecting his wife, and they and their allies have been watching secretly. They now concoct a plan for Falstaff&#x27;s punishment: dressed as supernatural creatures, they will ambush and torment him at midnight. Ford draws Dr. Caius aside and privately proposes a separate plot to marry him to Nannetta: Nannetta will be disguised as Queen of the Fairies, Caius will wear a monk&#x27;s costume, and Ford will join the two of them with a nuptial blessing. Mistress Quickly overhears and quietly vows to thwart Ford&#x27;s scheme.

&quot;Herne&#x27;s Oak in Windsor Park on a moonlit midnight&quot;

Fenton arrives at the oak tree and sings of his happiness (&quot;Dal labbro il canto estasiato vola&quot; / &quot;From my lips, a song of ecstasy flies&quot;) ending with &quot;Lips that are kissed lose none of their allure.&quot; Nannetta enters to finish the line with &quot;Indeed, they renew it, like the moon.&quot; The women arrive and disguise Fenton as a monk, telling him that they have arranged to spoil Ford&#x27;s and Caius&#x27;s plans. Nannetta, as the Fairy Queen, instructs her helpers (&quot;Sul fil d&#x27;un soffio etesio&quot; / &quot;On the breath of a fragrant breeze, fly, nimble spirits&quot;) before all the characters arrive on the scene. Falstaff&#x27;s attempted love scene with Alice is interrupted by the announcement that witches are approaching, and the men, disguised as elves and fairies, soundly thrash Falstaff. In the middle of the beating, he recognizes Bardolfo in disguise. The joke is over, and Falstaff acknowledges that he has received his due. Ford announces that a wedding will ensue. Caius and the Queen of the Fairies enter. A second couple, also in masquerade, ask Ford to deliver the same blessing for them as well. Ford conducts the double ceremony. Caius finds that instead of Nannetta, his bride is the disguised Bardolfo, and Ford has unwittingly blessed the marriage of Fenton and Nannetta. Ford accepts the &quot;fait accompli&quot; with good grace. Falstaff, pleased to find himself not the only dupe, proclaims that all the world is folly, and all are figures of fun (&quot;Tutto nel mondo è burla ... Tutti gabbati!...Ma ride ben chi ride La risata final.&quot; / &quot;Everything in the world is a jest ... but he laughs well who laughs the final laugh&quot;). The entire company repeats his proclamation in an exuberant ten-voice fugue.

==Music and drama==
Verdi scored &quot;Falstaff&quot; for three flutes (third doubling piccolo), two oboes, English horn, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, cimbasso, timpani, percussion (triangle, cymbals, bass drum), harp, and strings. In addition, a guitar, natural horn, and bell are heard from offstage. Unlike most of Verdi&#x27;s earlier operatic scores, &quot;Falstaff&quot; is through-composed. No list of numbers is printed in the published full score. The score differs from much of Verdi&#x27;s earlier work by having no overture: there are seven bars for the orchestra before the first voice (Dr Caius) enters. The critic Rodney Milnes comments that &quot;enjoyment... shines from every bar in its irresistible forward impulse, its effortless melody, its rhythmic vitality, and sureness of dramatic pace and construction.&quot; In &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Opera&quot;, Roger Parker writes that:

The opera was described by its creators as a &quot;commedia lirica&quot;. McDonald commented in 2009 that &quot;Falstaff&quot; is very different – a stylistic departure – from Verdi&#x27;s earlier work. In McDonald&#x27;s view most of the musical expression is in the dialogue, and there is only one traditional aria. The result is that &quot;such stylistic economy – more sophisticated, more challenging than he had employed before – is the keynote of the work.&quot; McDonald argues that consciously or unconsciously, Verdi was developing the idiom that would come to dominate the music of the 20th century: &quot;the lyricism is abbreviated, glanced at rather than indulged. Melodies bloom suddenly and then vanish, replaced by contrasting tempo or an unexpected phrase that introduces another character or idea&quot;. In McDonald&#x27;s view the orchestral writing acts as a sophisticated commentator on the action. It has influenced at least one of Verdi&#x27;s operatic successors: in 1952 Imogen Holst, musical assistant to Benjamin Britten, wrote, after a performance of &quot;Falstaff&quot;, &quot;I realised for the first time how much Ben owes to [Verdi]. There are orchestral bits which are &quot;just&quot; as funny to listen to as the comic instrumental bits in &quot;A. Herring&quot;!&quot;

The extent to which &quot;Falstaff&quot; is a &quot;Shakespearian&quot; opera has often been debated by critics. Although the action is taken from &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;, some commentators feel that Boito and Verdi have transmuted Shakespeare&#x27;s play into a wholly Italian work. The soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf believed there was nothing English or Shakespearian about the comedy: &quot;it was all done through the music&quot;. In 1961 Peter Heyworth wrote in &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;Because of Shakespeare we like to think of &quot;Falstaff&quot; as a work that has a certain Englishness. In fact the opera is no more English than &quot;Aida&quot; is Egyptian. Boito and Verdi between them transformed the fat knight into one of the archetypes of &quot;opera buffa&quot;.&quot; Verdi himself, however, felt that the Falstaff of the opera is not a conventional Italian &quot;buffo&quot; character, but portrays Shakespeare&#x27;s fuller, more ambiguous Falstaff of the &quot;Henry IV&quot; plays: &quot;My Falstaff is not merely the hero of &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;, who is simply a buffoon, and allows himself to be tricked by the women, but also the Falstaff of the two parts of &quot;Henry IV&quot;. Boito has written the libretto in accordance.&quot; A contemporary critic argued that the text &quot;imitated with marvellous accuracy the metre and rhythm of Shakespeare&#x27;s verse&quot;, but Hepokoski notes Boito&#x27;s use of traditional Italian metric conventions.

Another recurrent question is how much, if at all, Verdi was influenced by Wagner&#x27;s comic opera &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot;. At the time of the premiere this was a sensitive subject; many Italians were suspicious of or hostile to Wagner&#x27;s music, and were protective in a nationalistic way of Verdi&#x27;s reputation. Nevertheless, Verdi&#x27;s new style was markedly different from that of his popular works of the 1850s and 1860s, and it seemed to some to have Wagnerian echoes. In 1999 the critic Andrew Porter wrote, &quot;That &quot;Falstaff&quot; was Verdi&#x27;s and Boito&#x27;s answer to Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Meistersinger&quot; seems evident now. But the Italian &quot;Falstaff&quot; moves more quickly.&quot; Toscanini, who did more than anyone else to bring &quot;Falstaff&quot; into the regular operatic repertoire, commented:
Verdi scholars including Julian Budden have analysed the music in symphonic terms – the opening section &quot;a perfect little sonata movement&quot;, the second act concluding with a variant of the classic slow concertante ensemble leading to a fast stretto, and the whole opera ending with &quot;the most academic of musical forms&quot;, a fugue. Milnes suggests that this shows &quot;a wise old conservative&#x27;s warning about the excesses of the &quot;verismo&quot; school of Italian opera&quot; already on the rise by the 1890s. Among the solo numbers woven into the continuous score are Falstaff&#x27;s &quot;honour&quot; monologue, which concludes the first scene, and his reminiscent (&quot;Quand&#x27;ero paggio&quot;) about himself as a young page. The young lovers, Nannetta and Fenton, are given a lyrical and playful duet (&quot;Labbra di foco&quot;) in act 1; in act 3, Fenton&#x27;s impassioned love song, &quot;Dal labbro il canto estasiato vola&quot; briefly becomes a duet when Nannetta joins him. She then has the last substantial solo section of the score, the &quot;fairy&quot; aria, &quot;Sul fil d&#x27;un soffio etesio&quot;, described by Parker as &quot;yet another aria suffused with the soft orchestral colours that characterize this scene&quot;.

The score is seen by the critic Richard Osborne as rich in self-parody, with sinister themes from &quot;Rigoletto&quot; and &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; transmuted into comedy. For Osborne the nocturnal music of act 3 draws on the examples of Weber, Berlioz and Mendelssohn, creating a mood akin to that of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Osborne views the whole opera as an ensemble piece, and he comments that grand soliloquy in the old Verdian style is reserved for Ford&#x27;s &quot;jealousy&quot; aria in act 2, which is almost tragic in style but comic in effect, making Ford &quot;a figure to be laughed at.&quot; Osborne concludes his analysis, &quot;&quot;Falstaff&quot; is comedy&#x27;s musical apogee: the finest opera, inspired by the finest dramatist, by the finest opera composer the world has known&quot;.

==Recordings==

There are two early recordings of Falstaff&#x27;s short arietta &quot;Quand&#x27;ero paggio&quot;. Pini Corsi, the original Ford, recorded it in 1904, and Maurel followed in 1907. The first recording of the complete opera was made by Italian Columbia in March and April 1932. It was conducted by Lorenzo Molajoli with the chorus and orchestra of La Scala, and a cast including Giacomo Rimini as Falstaff and Pia Tassinari as Alice. Some live stage performances were recorded in the 1930s, but the next studio recording was that conducted by Arturo Toscanini for the 1950 NBC radio broadcast released on disc by RCA Victor. The first stereophonic recording was conducted by Herbert von Karajan for EMI in 1956.

Among the singers whose performances of the title role are on live or studio recordings, Italians include Renato Bruson, Tito Gobbi, Rolando Panerai, Ruggero Raimondi, Mariano Stabile, Giuseppe Taddei and Giuseppe Valdengo; Francophone singers include Gabriel Bacquier, Jean-Philippe Lafont and José van Dam; Germans include Walter Berry, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Hans Hotter; and UK and US singers include Geraint Evans, Donald Gramm, Bryn Terfel, Leonard Warren and Willard White.

<text>Aida (or Aïda, ) is a tragic opera in four acts by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto by Antonio Ghislanzoni. Set in the Old Kingdom of Egypt, it was commissioned by Cairo&#x27;s Khedivial Opera House and had its première there on 24 December 1871, in a performance conducted by Giovanni Bottesini. Today the work holds a central place in the operatic canon, receiving performances every year around the world. At New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera alone, &quot;Aida&quot; has been sung more than 1,100 times since 1886. Ghislanzoni&#x27;s scheme follows a scenario often attributed to the French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette, but Verdi biographer Mary Jane Phillips-Matz argues that the source is actually Temistocle Solera.

==Elements of the opera&#x27;s genesis and sources==
Isma&#x27;il Pasha, Khedive of Egypt, commissioned Verdi to write an opera to celebrate the opening of the Suez Canal, but Verdi declined. However, Auguste Mariette, a French Egyptologist, proposed to Khedive Pasha a plot for a celebratory opera set in ancient Egypt. Khedive Pasha referred Mariette to theatre manager Camille du Locle, who sent Mariette&#x27;s story idea to Verdi. Eventually, Verdi agreed to compose an opera based on that story, for 150,000 francs.

Because the scenery and costumes were stuck in the French capital during the Siege of Paris (1870–71) of the ongoing Franco-Prussian War, the premiere was delayed and Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Rigoletto&quot; was performed instead. The first opera performed at the Khedivial Opera House, &quot;Aida&quot; eventually premiered in Cairo on 24 December 1871.

==Performance history==

===Cairo premiere and initial success in Italy===

Verdi originally chose to write a brief orchestral prelude instead of a full overture for the opera. He then composed an overture of the &quot;potpourri&quot; variety to replace the original prelude. However, in the end he decided not to have the overture performed because of its—his own words—&quot;pretentious silliness&quot;. This overture, never used today, was given a rare broadcast performance by Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra on 30 March 1940, but was never commercially issued.

&quot;Aida&quot; met with great acclaim when it finally opened in Cairo on 24 December 1871. The costumes and accessories for the première were designed by Auguste Mariette, who also oversaw the design and construction of the sets, which were made in Paris by the Opéra&#x27;s scene painters Auguste-Alfred Rubé and Philippe Chaperon (acts 1 and 4) and Édouard Desplechin and Jean-Baptiste Lavastre (acts 2 and 3), and shipped to Cairo. Although Verdi did not attend the premiere in Cairo, he was most dissatisfied with the fact that the audience consisted of invited dignitaries, politicians and critics, but no members of the general public. He therefore considered the Italian (and European) première, held at La Scala, Milan on 8 February 1872, and a performance in which he was heavily involved at every stage, to be its &quot;real&quot; première.

Verdi had also written the role of Aida for the voice of Teresa Stolz, who sang it for the first time at the Milan première. Verdi had asked her fiancé, Angelo Mariani, to conduct the Cairo première, but he declined, so Giovanni Bottesini filled the gap. The Milan Amneris, Maria Waldmann, was his favourite in the role and she repeated it a number of times at his request.

&quot;Aida&quot; was received with great enthusiasm at its Milan première. The opera was soon mounted at major opera houses throughout Italy, including the Teatro Regio di Parma (20 April 1872), the Teatro di San Carlo (30 March 1873), La Fenice (11 June 1873), the Teatro Regio di Torino (26 December 1874), the Teatro Comunale di Bologna (30 September 1877, with Giuseppina Pasqua as Amneris and Franco Novara as the King), and the Teatro Costanzi (8 October 1881, with Theresia Singer as Aida and Giulia Novelli as Amneris) among others.

===Other 19th-century performances===

Details of important national and other premières of &quot;Aida&quot; follow:
* Argentina: 4 October 1873, at the original Teatro Colón, Buenos Aires, located at Rivadavia and Reconquista, then replaced by the headquarters of the Bank of the Argentine Nation.

* Rio de Janeiro: 30 June 1886, Theatro D. Pedro II. During rehearsals, the performers of the Italian touring opera company had disagreements with the local conductor Leopoldo Miguez, described as &quot;inept&quot;. After the failure of two replacement conductors, Arturo Toscanini, at the time a 19-year-old cellist who was assistant chorus master, was persuaded to conduct the performance. He conducted the entire opera from memory with great success—the start of a great career.

===20th century and beyond===
A complete concert version of the opera was given in New York City in 1949. Conducted by Toscanini with Herva Nelli as Aida and Richard Tucker as Radamès, it was televised on the NBC television network. Due to the length of the opera, it was divided into two telecasts, preserved on kinescopes, and later released on video by RCA and Testament. The audio portion of the broadcast, including some remakes in June 1954, was released on LP and CD by RCA Victor. Other notable performances from this period include a 1955 performance conducted by Tullio Serafin with Maria Callas as Aida and Richard Tucker as Radamès and a 1959 performance conducted by Herbert von Karajan with Renata Tebaldi as Aida and Carlo Bergonzi as Radamès.

La Scala mounted a lavish new production of &quot;Aida&quot; designed by Franco Zeffirelli for the opening night of its 2006/2007 season. The production starred Violeta Urmana in the title role and Roberto Alagna as Radamès. Alagna subsequently made the headlines when he was booed for his rendition of &quot;Celeste Aida&quot; during the second performance, walked off the stage, and was dismissed from the remainder of the run. The production continued to cause controversy in 2014 when Zeffirelli protested La Scala&#x27;s rental of the production to the Astana Opera House in Kazakhstan without his permission. According to Zeffirelli, the move had doomed his production to an &quot;infamous and brutal&quot; fate.
&quot;Aida&quot; continues to be a staple of the standard operatic repertoire. It is frequently performed in the Verona Arena, and is a staple of its renowned opera festival.

==Roles==
==Instrumentation==
3 flutes (3rd also piccolo), 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, cimbasso, timpani, triangle, bass drum, cymbals, tam-tam, harp, strings; on-stage banda: 6 Egyptian trumpets (&quot;Aida trumpets&quot;), military band, harp

==Setting==

The libretto does not specify a precise time period, so it is difficult to place the opera more specifically than the Old Kingdom. For the first production, Mariette went to great efforts to make the sets and costumes authentic. Considering the consistent artistic styles throughout the 3000-year history of ancient Egypt, a given production does not particularly need to choose a specific time period within the larger frame of ancient Egyptian history.

==Synopsis==
Backstory: The Egyptians have captured and enslaved Aida, an Ethiopian princess. An Egyptian military commander, Radamès, struggles to choose between his love for her and his loyalty to the King of Egypt. To complicate the story further, the King&#x27;s daughter Amneris is in love with Radamès, although he does not return her feelings.

===Act 1===
&quot;Scene 1: A hall in the King&#x27;s palace; through the rear gate the pyramids and temples of Memphis are visible&quot;

Ramfis, the high priest of Egypt, tells Radamès, the young warrior, that war with the Ethiopians seems inevitable, and Radamès hopes that he will be chosen as the Egyptian commander (Ramfis, Radamès: &quot;Sì, corre voce l&#x27;Etiope ardisca&quot; / Yes, it is rumored that Ethiopia dares once again to threaten our power).

Radamès dreams both of gaining victory on the battlefield and of Aida, an Ethiopian slave, with whom he is secretly in love (Radamès: &quot;Se quel guerrier io fossi! ... Celeste Aida&quot; / Heavenly Aida). Aida, who is also secretly in love with Radamès, is the captured daughter of the Ethiopian King Amonasro, but her Egyptian captors are unaware of her true identity. Her father has invaded Egypt to deliver her from servitude.

Amneris, the daughter of the Egyptian King, enters the hall. She too loves Radamès, but fears that his heart belongs to someone else (Radamès, Amneris: &quot;Quale insolita gioia nel tuo sguardo&quot; / In your looks I trace an joy).

Aida appears and, when Radamès sees her, Amneris notices that he looks disturbed. She suspects that Aida could be her rival, but is able to hide her jealousy and approach Aida (Amneris, Aida, Radamès: &quot;Vieni, o diletta, appressati&quot; / Come, O delight, come closer).
The King enters, along with the High Priest, Ramfis, and the whole palace court. A messenger announces that the Ethiopians, led by King Amonasro, are marching towards Thebes. The King declares war and proclaims that Radamès is the man chosen by the goddess Isis to be the leader of the army (The King, Messenger, Radamès, Aida, Amneris, Ramfis, chorus: &quot;Alta cagion v&#x27;aduna .. Guerra, guerra, guerra!&quot; / Oh fate o&#x27;er Egypt looming .. War, war, war!). Upon receiving this mandate from the King, Radamès proceeds to the temple of Vulcan to take up the sacred arms (The King, Radamès, Aida, Amneris, chorus: &quot;Su! del Nilo al sacro lido&quot; .. (reprise) &quot;Guerra, guerra, guerra!&quot; / On! Of Nilus&#x27; sacred river, guard the shores .. (reprise) War, war, war!).

Alone in the hall, Aida feels torn between her love for her father, her country, and Radamès (Aida: &quot;Ritorna vincitor!&quot; / Return a conqueror!).

&quot;Scene 2: Inside the Temple of Ptah&quot;

Solemn ceremonies and dances by the priestesses take place (High Priestess, chorus, Radamès: &quot;Possente Ftha ... Tu che dal nulla&quot; / O mighty Ptah). This is followed by the installation of Radamès to the office of commander-in-chief (High Priestess, chorus, Ramfis, Radamès: &quot;Immenso Ftha .. Mortal, diletto ai Numi&quot; / O mighty one, guard and protect!). All present in the temple pray fervently for the victory of Egypt and protection for their warriors (&quot;Nume, custode e vindice&quot;/ Hear us, O guardian deity).

===Act 2===
&quot;Scene 1: The chamber of Amneris&quot;

Dances and music to celebrate Radamès&#x27; victory take place (Chorus, Amneris: &quot;Chi mai fra gli inni e i plausi&quot; / Our songs his glory praising). However, Amneris is still in doubt about Radamès&#x27; love and wonders whether Aida is in love with him. She tries to forget her doubt, entertaining her worried heart with the dance of Moorish slaves (Chorus, Amneris: &quot;Vieni: sul crin ti piovano&quot; / Come bind your flowing tresses).
When Aida enters the chamber, Amneris asks everyone to leave. By falsely telling Aida that Radamès has died in the battle, she tricks her into professing her love for him. In grief, and shocked by the news, Aida confesses that her heart belongs to Radamès eternally (Amneris, Aida: &quot;Fu la sorte dell&#x27;armi a&#x27; tuoi funesta&quot; / The battle&#x27;s outcome was cruel for your people).
This confession fires Amneris with rage, and she plans on taking revenge on Aida. Ignoring Aida&#x27;s pleadings (Amneris, Aida, chorus: &quot;Su! del Nilo al sacro lido&quot; / Up! at the sacred shores of the Nile), Amneris leaves her alone in the chamber.

&quot;Scene 2: The grand gate of the city of Thebes&quot;

Radamès returns victorious and the troops march into the city (Chorus, Ramfis: &quot;Gloria all&#x27;Egitto, ad Iside&quot; / Glory to Egypt, [and] to Isis!).

The Egyptian king decrees that on this day the triumphant Radamès may have anything he wishes. The Ethiopian captives are led onstage in chains, Amonasro among them. Aida immediately rushes to her father, who whispers to her to conceal his true identity as King of Ethiopia from the Egyptians. Amonasro deceptively proclaims to the Egyptians that the Ethiopian king (referring to himself) has been slain in battle. Aida, Amonasro, and the captured Ethiopians plead with the Egyptian King for mercy, but Ramfis and the Egyptian priests call for their death (Aida, Amneris, Radamès, The King, Amonasro, chorus: &quot;Che veggo! .. Egli? .. Mio padre! .. Anch&#x27;io pugnai .. Struggi, o Re, queste ciurme feroci&quot; / What do I see?.. Is it he? My father? .. Destroy, O King, these ferocious creatures).

Claiming the reward promised by the King of Egypt, Radamès pleads with him to spare the lives of the prisoners and to set them free. The King grants Radamès&#x27; wish, and declares that he (Radamès) will be his (the King&#x27;s) successor and will marry the King&#x27;s daughter (Amneris). (Aida, Amneris, Radamès, Ramfis, The King, Amonasro, chorus: &quot;O Re: pei sacri Numi! .. Gloria all&#x27;Egitto&quot; / O King, by the sacred gods ... Glory to Egypt!). At Ramfis&#x27; suggestion to the King, Aida and Amonasro remain as hostages to ensure that the Ethiopians do not avenge their defeat.

===Act 3===

&quot;On the banks of the Nile, near the Temple of Isis&quot;

Prayers are said (Chorus, High Priestess, Ramfis, Amneris: &quot;O tu che sei d&#x27;Osiride&quot; / O thou who to Osiris art) on the eve of Amneris and Radamès&#x27; wedding in the Temple of Isis. Outside, Aida waits to meet with Radamès as they had planned (Aida: &quot;Qui Radamès verra .. O patria mia&quot; / Oh, my dear country!).

Amonasro appears and orders Aida to find out the location of the Egyptian army from Radamès. Aida, torn between her love for Radamès and her loyalty to her native land and to her father, reluctantly agrees. (Aida, Amonasro: &quot;Ciel, mio padre! .. Rivedrai le foreste imbalsamate&quot; / Once again shalt thou gaze). When Radamès arrives, Amonasro hides behind a rock and listens to their conversation.

Radamès affirms that he will marry Aida (&quot;Pur ti riveggo, mia dolce Aida .. Nel fiero anelito&quot;; &quot;Fuggiam gli ardori inospiti .. Là, tra foreste vergini&quot; / I see you again, my sweet Aida!), and Aida convinces him to flee to the desert with her.

To facilitate their escape, Radamès suggests using a secure route free from the risk of discovery and discloses the location his army plans to attack. Upon hearing this, Amonasro emerges from hiding and reveals his true identity. Radamès, horrified, realizes he has inadvertently divulged a critical military secret to the enemy. Meanwhile, Amneris and Ramfis leave the temple, spot Radamès in conference with the enemy, and summon the imperial guards. Amonasro, armed with a dagger, intends to kill Amneris and Ramfis before they can alert the guards, but Radamès disarms him. He swiftly instructs Amonasro to flee with Aida and surrenders himself to the guards, who arrest him as a traitor.

===Act 4===
&quot;Scene 1: A hall in the Temple of Justice. To one side is the door leading to Radamès&#x27; prison cell&quot;

Amneris desires to save Radamès (&quot;L&#x27;aborrita rivale a me sfuggia&quot; / My hated rival has escaped me). She calls for the guard to bring him to her.

She asks Radamès to deny the accusations, but Radamès, who does not wish to live without Aida, refuses. He is relieved to know Aida is still alive and hopes she has reached her own country (Amneris, Radamès: &quot;Già i Sacerdoti adunansi&quot; / Already the priests are assembling).

Offstage, Ramfis recites the charges against Radamès and calls on him to defend himself, but he stands mute, and is condemned to death as a traitor. Amneris, who remains onstage, protests that Radamès is innocent, and pleads with the priests to show mercy. The priests sentence him to be buried alive; Amneris weeps and curses the priests as he is taken away (Judgment scene, Amneris, Ramfis, and chorus: &quot;Ahimè! .. morir mi sento .. Radamès, è deciso il tuo fato&quot; / Alas .. I feel death .. Radamès, your fate is decided).
&quot;Scene 2: The lower portion of the stage shows the vault in the Temple of Ptah; the upper portion represents the temple itself&quot;

Radamès has been taken into the lower floor of the temple and sealed up in a dark vault, where he thinks that he is alone. As he hopes that Aida is in a safer place, he hears a sigh and then sees Aida. She has hidden herself in the vault in order to die with Radamès (Radamès: &quot;La fatal pietra sovra me si chiuse&quot; / The fatal stone now closes over me). They accept their terrible fate (Radamès: &quot;Morir! Sì pura e bella&quot; / To die! So pure and lovely!) and bid farewell to Earth and its sorrows (duet &quot;Invan! Tutto è finito ... O terra addio&quot;). Above the vault in the temple of Ptah, Amneris weeps and prays to the goddess Isis. In the vault below, Aida dies in Radamès&#x27; arms as the priests, offstage, pray to the god Ptah. (Chorus, Aida, Radamès, Amneris: &quot;Immenso Ftha&quot; / Almighty Ptah).

==Adaptations==
The 1952 Broadway musical &quot;My Darlin&#x27; Aida&quot;, set on a plantation in Tennessee in the first year of the American Civil War, is based on the opera and uses Verdi&#x27;s music.

The opera has been adapted for motion pictures on several occasions, most notably in a 1953 production which starred Lois Maxwell as Amneris and Sophia Loren as Aida, and a 1987 Swedish production. In both cases, the lead actors lip-synched to recordings by actual opera singers. In the case of the 1953 film, Ebe Stignani sang as Amneris, while Renata Tebaldi sang as Aida.

The opera&#x27;s story, but not its music, was used as the basis for a 1998 musical of the same name written by Elton John and Tim Rice.

The opera has been portrayed in the 2001 Italian animated film &quot;Aida of the Trees&quot; (&quot;Aida degli alberi&quot;). The characters are seen as anthropomorphic creatures between the fictional kingdoms of Alborea and Petra as the star-crossed lovers must find a way to unify their worlds while facing off against the evil high priest Ramfis.

<text>George Michael Dolenz Jr. ( ; born March 8, 1945) is an American musician and actor. He was the drummer and one of two primary vocalists for the pop rock band the Monkees (1966–1970, and reunions until 2021), and a co-star of the TV series &quot;The Monkees&quot; (1966–1968). Dolenz is the last surviving member of the band.

==Life and entertainment career==
Dolenz was born in Los Angeles, the son of actors George Dolenz and Janelle Johnson. He has three sisters, Gemma Marie (&quot;Coco&quot;), Deborah, and Kathleen (&quot;Gina&quot;). Gemma&#x27;s nickname, Coco, is a shortened form of &quot;Coco Sunshine&quot;, a nickname given to her as a child by Micky. Coco was a frequent guest on the set of &quot;The Monkees&quot; TV show and sometimes a guest performer on records by the Monkees, singing background vocals or duetting with Micky. She often performs as a member of Micky&#x27;s backing band during his concerts.

Dolenz suffered from Perthes disease as a child, affecting his hip joint and right leg, leaving that leg weaker (and shorter) than the other. This resulted in Dolenz adapting an unorthodox drum setup – right-handed and left-footed – in his musical career.

=== &quot;Circus Boy&quot; ===

Dolenz began his show-business career in 1956 when he starred in a children&#x27;s TV show called &quot;Circus Boy&quot; under the name Mickey Braddock. He played Corky, an orphaned water boy for the elephants in a one-ring circus at the start of the 20th century. The program ran for two seasons, after which Dolenz made sporadic appearances on network television shows and pursued his education. Dolenz went to Ulysses S. Grant High School in Valley Glen and graduated in 1962. In 1964, he was cast as Ed in the episode &quot;Born of Kings and Angels&quot; of the NBC education drama series &quot;Mr. Novak&quot;, starring James Franciscus as an idealistic Los Angeles teacher. Dolenz was attending college in Los Angeles when he was hired for the &quot;drummer&quot; role in NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Monkees&quot;.

==Early musical career==
Dolenz originally had his own rock band called &quot;Micky and the One-Nighters&quot; in the early- to mid-1960s with himself as lead singer. He had already begun writing his own songs. According to Dolenz, his band&#x27;s live stage act included rock songs, cover songs, and even some R&amp;B. One of his favorite songs to sing was Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot;, which he sang at his Monkees audition, resulting in his being hired as one of the cast/band members. He recorded two 45s in 1965 that went unreleased until the Monkees&#x27; success in 1967. Issued on the Challenge label, the recordings were &quot;Don&#x27;t Do It&quot; b/w &quot;Plastic Symphony III&quot; and &quot;Huff Puff&quot; b/w &quot;Fate (Big Ben)&quot;. Neither B-side on the Challenge 45s is by Dolenz, but rather a band later credited as The Obvious.

===The Monkees===

In 1965, Dolenz was cast in the television sitcom &quot;The Monkees&quot; and became the drummer and a lead vocalist in the band created for the show. Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, writers of many of the Monkees&#x27; songs, observed quickly that when brought into the studio together, the four actors would try to make each other laugh. Because of this, the writers often brought in each singer individually. The antics escalated until Dolenz poured a cup of ice on Don Kirshner&#x27;s head. At the time, Dolenz did not know Kirshner on sight.

During tension-filled times, Mike Nesmith and Peter Tork voluntarily turned over lead vocal duties to Dolenz on their own compositions.

Dolenz wrote a few of the band&#x27;s self-penned songs, most prominently &quot;Randy Scouse Git&quot; from the album &quot;Headquarters&quot;. He provided the lead vocals for such hits as &quot;Last Train to Clarksville&quot;, &quot;Pleasant Valley Sunday&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot;.

Dolenz purchased the third modular Moog synthesizer sold commercially. (The first two belonged to Wendy Carlos and Buck Owens.) His performance on the Monkees&#x27; song &quot;Daily Nightly&quot; (written by Nesmith), from the album &quot;Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn &amp; Jones Ltd.&quot;, was one of the first uses of the synthesizer on a rock recording. He eventually sold his instrument to Bobby Sherman.

He is the last surviving member of the Monkees (after Davy Jones&#x27;s death in 2012, Tork&#x27;s in 2019, and Nesmith&#x27;s in 2021). He is the only member of the Monkees who was part of every lineup from the band&#x27;s inception, and the only member with contemporary recordings of his vocals on all studio albums.

==Solo MGM recordings==

The Moog synthesizer that Dolenz had bought proved vital when he composed a song entitled &quot;Easy on You&quot; in 1971; he began recording it in his home studio, playing acoustic guitar and drums, and using the Moog like a keyboard. With that song completed, he next invited former Monkee Peter Tork over to help with more recordings. Then, a fortuitous street encounter led to former Monkee stand-in David Price joining, as well as contributing a rock song he had written called &quot;Oh Someone&quot;. With Dolenz on drums and vocals, Tork on bass, and Price on rhythm guitar, the song was completed in only two hours; subsequently, guitarist B.J. Jones came in two days later and added lead guitar. With these two songs recorded, Dolenz contacted his former high school friend Mike Curb, then the head of MGM Records; after playing the songs for Curb, Dolenz was immediately signed to MGM.

Dolenz recorded and released songs for MGM for about three years (with a few of the songs being credited to Starship, an ersatz group, not the later Jefferson Starship). After the first year, Dolenz&#x27;s friend Harry Nilsson contributed his song &quot;Daybreak&quot;, also arranging and producing the recording, which included Keith Allison on guitar, former Monkees producer Chip Douglas on bass, and steel-guitarist Orville &quot;Red&quot; Rhodes.

By early 1974, with no chart successes to date, Dolenz headed to England, and with Tony Scotti, he cut four songs for MGM: two rock classics, &quot;Splish Splash&quot; and &quot;Purple People Eater&quot;, as well as &quot;I Hate Rock and Roll&quot; and a new song, &quot;Wing Walker&quot;. Meanwhile, Mike Curb left MGM and joined Warner Bros. Records. Dolenz&#x27;s association with MGM then ended (and those final four songs remained unreleased).

==Dolenz, Jones, Boyce &amp; Hart==
In part because of reruns of &quot;The Monkees&quot; on Saturday mornings and in syndication, &quot;The Monkees Greatest Hits&quot; charted in 1976. The LP, issued by Arista (a subsidiary of Columbia Pictures), was actually a repackaging of a 1972 compilation LP called &quot;Re-Focus&quot; that had been issued by Arista&#x27;s previous label imprint, Bell Records, also owned by Columbia Pictures.

Dolenz and Jones took advantage of this, joining ex-Monkees songwriters Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart to tour the United States. They could not use the Monkees name for legal reasons, but from 1975 to 1977, as the &quot;Golden Hits of The Monkees&quot; show (&quot;The Guys Who Wrote &#x27;Em and the Guys Who Sang &#x27;Em!&quot;), they successfully performed in smaller venues such as state fairs and amusement parks, as well as making stops in Japan, Thailand, and Singapore. They also released an album of new material, appropriately called &quot;Dolenz, Jones, Boyce &amp; Hart&quot;, and a live album, &quot;Concert in Japan&quot;, was released by Capitol in 1976.

A Christmas single (credited to Dolenz, Jones and Tork) was produced by Chip Douglas and released on his own label in 1976. The single featured Douglas&#x27;s and Howard Kaylan&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Is My Time of Year&quot; (originally recorded by a 1960s supergroup, The Christmas Spirit), with a B-side of Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;White Christmas&quot; (Douglas released a remixed version of the single, with additional overdubbed instruments, in 1986). Tork also joined Dolenz, Jones, Boyce &amp; Hart on stage at Disneyland on July 4, 1976, and also joined Dolenz and Jones on stage at the Starwood in Hollywood, California in 1977.

==Notable stage work==

In 1977, he performed with former bandmate Davy Jones in a stage production of the Harry Nilsson musical &quot;The Point!&quot; at London&#x27;s Mermaid Theatre, playing and singing the part of the &quot;Count&#x27;s Kid&quot; and the Leafman to Jones&#x27; starring role as Oblio (according to the CD booklet). An original cast recording was made and released. The comedic chemistry of Dolenz and Jones proved so strong that the show was revived in 1978 with Nilsson inserting additional comedy for the two, plus two more songs, with one of them (&quot;Gotta Get Up&quot;) being sung by Dolenz and Jones together. The show was considered successful enough that another revival was planned for 1979, but it proved cost-prohibitive. After the show&#x27;s run, Dolenz remained in England and began directing for stage and television, as well as producing several of the shows he directed.
From August to September 2006, Dolenz played Charlemagne at the Goodspeed Opera House for the revival of the musical &quot;Pippin&quot; in East Haddam, Connecticut. He also toured in that role. Also in the mid-2000s, Dolenz played the role of Zoser in the Broadway production of Elton John and Tim Rice&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot;.

==After Monkees television and film career==
After &quot;The Monkees&quot; television show ended, Dolenz continued performing providing voice-overs for a number of Saturday-morning cartoon series including &quot;The Funky Phantom&quot;, &quot;Partridge Family 2200 A.D.&quot;, &quot;The Scooby-Doo Show&quot;, &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kids&quot;, &quot;These Are the Days&quot;, &quot;Devlin&quot;, and &quot;Wonder Wheels&quot; (from &quot;The Skatebirds&quot;). Dolenz provided the voice of Arthur in the first season of the animated series &quot;The Tick&quot;. In 1972, Dolenz played Vance in the murder mystery film &quot;Night of the Strangler&quot;. He was featured in an episode of &quot;Adam-12&quot;, entitled &quot;Dirt Duel&quot; (season 5, episode 1), and an episode of &quot;Cannon&quot;, entitled &quot;Bitter Legion&quot; (season 2, episode 3). Dolenz provided the voice of Two-Face&#x27;s twin henchmen Min and Max in the two-part episode &quot;Two-Face&quot; on &quot;&quot;. In a September 2006 radio interview, Dolenz reported that he was the current voice of Snuggle the Fabric Softener Bear at that time. In 2017, Dolenz returned to voice-over, providing the voice of Wendell the Love Grub, as well as singing the featured song, in the Cartoon Network series &quot;Mighty Magiswords&quot; half-hour episode, &quot;The Saga of Robopiggeh!&quot;. Dolenz recorded the voice-acting remotely in New York weeks before his Good Times! tour.

Both Dolenz and Michael Nesmith auditioned for the role of Arthur &quot;The Fonz&quot; Fonzarelli on &quot;Happy Days&quot;, but neither was selected, as they were both taller than lead actor Ron Howard and co-stars Anson Williams and Don Most.

In 1975, Dolenz acted in &quot;Linda Lovelace for President&quot;, starring Linda Lovelace.

In 1994–95, Dolenz played in two episodes of the sitcom &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;; in the first one (entitled &quot;Band on the Run&quot;), he played Norm, a bandmate of Alan Matthews. In 1995, he joined Davy Jones and Peter Tork in episode eight of the third season (entitled &quot;Rave On&quot;), although they did not play the Monkees, per se – Dolenz&#x27;s character is &quot;Gordy&quot;, while Davy Jones is &quot;Reginald Fairfield&quot; and Tork is &quot;Jedidiah Lawrence&quot;. However, at the climax of the program, the three are put on stage together and perform the classic Buddy Holly song &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, and the Temptations&#x27; &quot;My Girl&quot;. As an inside joke, actor Dave Madden, who had played the manager on &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, cameoed as a manager; he suddenly appears, wanting to handle the &quot;new&quot; group, and tells them that they &quot;could be bigger than The Beatles&quot;, which they all scoff at.

In 2007, he appeared in Rob Zombie&#x27;s remake of &quot;Halloween&quot; as Derek Allan, the owner of a gun shop.

On January 29, 2011, Dolenz appeared in the Syfy Channel film &quot;Mega Python vs. Gatoroid&quot;, alongside Debbie Gibson and Tiffany. On February 21, 2015, he had a cameo as himself in the Adult Swim TV special &quot;Bagboy&quot;. In 2017, he appeared as himself on the sitcom &quot;Difficult People&quot;.

==Directorial work==
In 1980, Dolenz produced and directed the British television sitcom &quot;Metal Mickey&quot;, featuring a large metallic robot with the catch-phrase &quot;boogie boogie&quot;. In 1981, he directed a short film based on the sketch &quot;Balham, Gateway to the South&quot;, with Robbie Coltrane playing multiple roles. In the early 1980s, Dolenz directed a stage adaptation of &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot;. He was producer of the TV show &quot;Luna&quot; in 1983–84.

==MTV reignites Monkee Mania==
In 1986, a screening of the entire Monkees television series by MTV led to renewed interest in the band, followed by a single, &quot;That Was Then, This Is Now&quot;, which reached No. 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the U.S. and No.41 in Canada, a 20th-anniversary tour, a greatest hits album, and a brand new LP, &quot;Pool It!&quot; in 1987. The band&#x27;s original albums were reissued, and all hit the record charts at the same time.

Beginning in 1986, Dolenz joined the other ex-Monkees for several tours and toured extensively as a solo artist. 

=== WCBS-FM ===

On January 10, 2005, Dolenz replaced Dan Taylor as the morning disc jockey at oldies radio station WCBS-FM in New York. On June 3, 2005, Dolenz celebrated his 100th show with a special morning show at B.B. King&#x27;s. That was also his last regular show at the station; at 5:00 pm, WCBS-FM announced that the station would replace its oldies format with a &quot;Jack&quot; format, eliminating the need for on-air disc jockeys.

However, WCBS-FM eventually returned to its oldies format on July 12, 2007, with Taylor re-assuming his role as the morning disc jockey the following day. Several months later, on February 3, 2008, Dolenz was invited back to the station to present his long-postponed 101st show and final in-studio appearance there by guest-hosting a three-hour broadcast during WCBS&#x27; Sunday evening &quot;New York Radio Greats&quot; program.

=== Solo work and further Monkees reunions ===
In 2009, Dolenz signed a deal to record an album of the classic songs of Carole King, titled &quot;King for a Day&quot;. The album (released on Gigitone Records) was produced by Jeffrey Foskett, who has worked extensively with Brian Wilson and played on Wilson&#x27;s 2004 Grammy-winning &quot;Brian Wilson Presents Smile&quot;. King&#x27;s songs &quot;Pleasant Valley Sunday&quot;, &quot;Sometime in the Morning&quot;, and &quot;Porpoise Song&quot; (Theme from &quot;Head&quot;) have emerged as signature songs from the Monkees. As of February 2010, he was appearing on stage in London in &quot;Hairspray&quot; with Michael Ball. The show also went on tour and had a successful run in Dublin, Ireland, during November 2010. In 2011, he rejoined Tork and Jones for An Evening with The Monkees: The 45th Anniversary Tour. 
After Jones&#x27; sudden death in February 2012, Dolenz and Tork reunited with Michael Nesmith for a 12-concert tour of the United States as a tribute. The three remaining Monkees toured again in 2013 and 2014 and Dolenz toured as a duo with Tork in 2015 and 2016.

Following Tork&#x27;s death in 2019, Dolenz toured with Nesmith as &quot;The Mike and Micky Show&quot; in 2018 and 2019. On May 4, 2021, Dolenz and Nesmith announced &quot;The Monkees Farewell Tour&quot; which was the last for the group. The tour consisted of 40 US dates from September to November. The final show was held on November 14, 2021, at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles.

On May 21, 2021, Dolenz released a solo album, &quot;Dolenz Sings Nesmith&quot;, featuring songs written by Nesmith and produced by Christian Nesmith.

On November 3, 2023 Dolenz released an EP of R.E.M. cover songs.

===Other tours===
In late 2019, Dolenz toured with Todd Rundgren, Jason Scheff, Christopher Cross, and Joey Molland of Badfinger, in celebration of the Beatles&#x27; White Album on the &quot;It Was Fifty Years Ago Today – A Tribute to the Beatles&#x27; White Album&quot; tour. Dolenz performed the Monkees&#x27; songs &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot; and &quot;Pleasant Valley Sunday&quot;.

==Personal life==

Dolenz has been married three times and is the father of four daughters. In 1967, while in the UK on tour with the Monkees, Dolenz met future wife Samantha Juste, a co-presenter on BBC TV&#x27;s pop music show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. They married in 1968, and their daughter Ami Bluebell Dolenz was born on January 8, 1969; she became an actress who was particularly active in the 1980s and 1990s. Dolenz and Juste divorced in 1975, but remained close friends until her death following a stroke on February 5, 2014.

He married Trina Dow in 1977. They had three daughters: Charlotte Janelle (born August 8, 1981), Emily Claire (born July 25, 1983), and Georgia Rose (born September 3, 1984). They divorced in 1991. Trina Dow Dolenz has become a couples therapist, still using her married name.

Dolenz married his third wife, Donna Quinter, in 2002.

<doc id="37892" wikidata="Q533668" url="?curid=37892" title="Thrust">
<text>Thrust is a reaction force described quantitatively by Newton&#x27;s third law. When a system expels or accelerates mass in one direction, the accelerated mass will cause a force of equal magnitude but opposite direction to be applied to that system.
The force applied on a surface in a direction perpendicular or normal to the surface is also called thrust. Force, and thus thrust, is measured using the International System of Units (SI) in newtons (symbol: N), and represents the amount needed to accelerate 1 kilogram of mass at the rate of 1 meter per second per second. In mechanical engineering, force orthogonal to the main load (such as in parallel helical gears) is referred to as static thrust.

== Examples ==
A fixed-wing aircraft propulsion system generates forward thrust when air is pushed in the direction opposite to flight. This can be done by different means such as the spinning blades of a propeller, the propelling jet of a jet engine, or by ejecting hot gases from a rocket engine. Reverse thrust can be generated to aid braking after landing by reversing the pitch of variable-pitch propeller blades, or using a thrust reverser on a jet engine. Rotary wing aircraft use rotors and thrust vectoring V/STOL aircraft use propellers or engine thrust to support the weight of the aircraft and to provide forward propulsion.

A motorboat propeller generates thrust when it rotates and forces water backwards.

A rocket is propelled forward by a thrust equal in magnitude, but opposite in direction, to the time-rate of momentum change of the exhaust gas accelerated from the combustion chamber through the rocket engine nozzle. This is the exhaust velocity with respect to the rocket, times the time-rate at which the mass is expelled, or in mathematical terms:
:formula_1
Where T is the thrust generated (force), formula_2 is the rate of change of mass with respect to time (mass flow rate of exhaust), and v is the velocity of the exhaust gases measured relative to the rocket.

For vertical launch of a rocket the initial thrust at must be more than the weight.

Each of the three Space Shuttle Main Engines could produce a thrust of 1.8 meganewton, and each of the Space Shuttle&#x27;s two Solid Rocket Boosters , together 29.4 MN.

By contrast, the Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue (SAFER) has 24 thrusters of each.

In the air-breathing category, the AMT-USA AT-180 jet engine developed for radio-controlled aircraft produce 90 N (20 lbf) of thrust. The GE90-115B engine fitted on the Boeing 777-300ER has a thrust of 569 kN (127,900 lbf). It was recognized by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the &quot;World&#x27;s Most Powerful Commercial Jet Engine&quot; until it was surpassed by the GE9X (fitted on the upcoming Boeing 777X), with 609 kN (134,300 lbf).

==Concepts==
===Thrust to power===
The power needed to generate thrust and the force of the thrust can be related in a non-linear way. In general, formula_3. The proportionality constant varies, and can be solved for a uniform flow, where formula_4 is the incoming air velocity, formula_5 is the velocity at the actuator disc, and formula_6 is the final exit velocity:

:formula_7

:formula_8

:formula_9

Solving for the velocity at the disc, formula_5, we then have:
:formula_11

When incoming air is accelerated from a standstill – for example when hovering – then formula_12, and we can find:

:formula_13

From here we can see the formula_3 relationship, finding:

:formula_15

The inverse of the proportionality constant, the &quot;efficiency&quot; of an otherwise-perfect thruster, is proportional to the area of the cross section of the propelled volume of fluid (formula_16) and the density of the fluid (formula_17). This helps to explain why moving through water is easier and why aircraft have much larger propellers than watercraft.

===Thrust to propulsive power===
A very common question is how to compare the thrust rating of a jet engine with the power rating of a piston engine. Such comparison is difficult, as these quantities are not equivalent. A piston engine does not move the aircraft by itself (the propeller does that), so piston engines are usually rated by how much power they deliver to the propeller. Except for changes in temperature and air pressure, this quantity depends basically on the throttle setting.

A jet engine has no propeller, so the propulsive power of a jet engine is determined from its thrust as follows. Power is the force (F) it takes to move something over some distance (d) divided by the time (t) it takes to move that distance:

:formula_18

In case of a rocket or a jet aircraft, the force is exactly the thrust (T) produced by the engine. If the rocket or aircraft is moving at about a constant speed, then distance divided by time is just speed, so power is thrust times speed:

:formula_19

This formula looks very surprising, but it is correct: the &quot;propulsive power&quot; (or &quot;power available&quot; ) of a jet engine increases with its speed. If the speed is zero, then the propulsive power is zero. If a jet aircraft is at full throttle but attached to a static test stand, then the jet engine produces no propulsive power, however thrust is still produced. The combination piston engine–propeller also has a propulsive power with exactly the same formula, and it will also be zero at zero speed – but that is for the engine–propeller set. The engine alone will continue to produce its rated power at a constant rate, whether the aircraft is moving or not.

Now, imagine the strong chain is broken, and the jet and the piston aircraft start to move. At low speeds:
The piston engine will have constant 100% power, and the propeller&#x27;s thrust will vary with speed
The jet engine will have constant 100% thrust, and the engine&#x27;s power will vary with speed
===Excess thrust===
If a powered aircraft is generating thrust T and experiencing drag D, the difference between the two, T − D, is termed the excess thrust. The instantaneous performance of the aircraft is mostly dependent on the excess thrust.

Excess thrust is a vector and is determined as the vector difference between the thrust vector and the drag vector.

===Thrust axis===

The thrust axis for an airplane is the line of action of the total thrust at any instant. It depends on the location, number, and characteristics of the jet engines or propellers. It usually differs from the drag axis. If so, the distance between the thrust axis and the drag axis will cause a moment that must be resisted by a change in the aerodynamic force on the horizontal stabiliser. Notably, the Boeing 737 MAX, with larger, lower-slung engines than previous 737 models, had a greater distance between the thrust axis and the drag axis, causing the nose to rise up in some flight regimes, necessitating a pitch-control system, MCAS. Early versions of MCAS malfunctioned in flight with catastrophic consequences, leading to the deaths of over 300 people in 2018 and 2019.

<text>The Savoy knot, a type of decorative knot, is a heraldic knot used primarily in Italian heraldry. It is most notable for its appearance on the heraldic badge of the House of Savoy, where it is accompanied by the motto &quot;Stringe ma non costringe&quot;, &quot;It tightens, but does not constrain&quot;. The Cavendish knot is an identical heraldic knot. In shape, the Savoy knot is comparable to a figure eight.

When used outside heraldry (as a real knot), it is known as a figure-eight knot.

The Savoy knot can also be seen on the Alfa Romeo automobile badge (founded and manufactured in Milan, Italy) up to 1943.

<text>The Collatz conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1. It concerns sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if a term is even, the next term is one half of it. If a term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that these sequences always reach 1, no matter which positive integer is chosen to start the sequence. The conjecture has been shown to hold for all positive integers up to , but no general proof has been found.

It is named after the mathematician Lothar Collatz, who introduced the idea in 1937, two years after receiving his doctorate. The sequence of numbers involved is sometimes referred to as the hailstone sequence, hailstone numbers or hailstone numerals (because the values are usually subject to multiple descents and ascents like hailstones in a cloud), or as wondrous numbers.

Paul Erdős said about the Collatz conjecture: &quot;Mathematics may not be ready for such problems.&quot; Jeffrey Lagarias stated in 2010 that the Collatz conjecture &quot;is an extraordinarily difficult problem, completely out of reach of present day mathematics&quot;. However, though the Collatz conjecture itself remains open, efforts to solve the problem have led to new techniques and many partial results.

==Statement of the problem==

Consider the following operation on an arbitrary positive integer:

* If the number is even, divide it by two.
* If the number is odd, triple it and add one.

In modular arithmetic notation, define the function as follows:
formula_1

Now form a sequence by performing this operation repeatedly, beginning with any positive integer, and taking the result at each step as the input at the next.

In notation:
formula_2
(that is: is the value of applied to recursively times; ).

The Collatz conjecture is: &quot;This process will eventually reach the number 1, regardless of which positive integer is chosen initially. That is, for each&quot; formula_3, there is some formula_4 with formula_5.

If the conjecture is false, it can only be because there is some starting number which gives rise to a sequence that does not contain 1. Such a sequence would either enter a repeating cycle that excludes 1, or increase without bound. No such sequence has been found.

The smallest such that is called the stopping time of . Similarly, the smallest such that is called the total stopping time of . If one of the indexes or doesn&#x27;t exist, we say that the stopping time or the total stopping time, respectively, is infinite.

The Collatz conjecture asserts that the total stopping time of every is finite. It is also equivalent to saying that every has a finite stopping time.

Since is even whenever is odd, one may instead use the &quot;shortcut&quot; form of the Collatz function:
formula_6
This definition yields smaller values for the stopping time and total stopping time without changing the overall dynamics of the process.

==Empirical data==
For instance, starting with and applying the function without &quot;shortcut&quot;, one gets the sequence .

The number takes longer to reach 1: .
The sequence for , listed and graphed below, takes 111 steps (41 steps through odd numbers, in bold), climbing as high as 9232 before descending to 1.

Numbers with a total stopping time longer than that of any smaller starting value form a sequence beginning with:
:1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 18, 25, 27, 54, 73, 97, 129, 171, 231, 313, 327, 649, 703, 871, 1161, 2223, 2463, 2919, 3711, 6171, ... .

The starting values whose maximum trajectory point is greater than that of any smaller starting value are as follows:
:1, 2, 3, 7, 15, 27, 255, 447, 639, 703, 1819, 4255, 4591, 9663, 20895, 26623, 31911, 60975, 77671, 113383, 138367, 159487, 270271, 665215, 704511, ... 

Number of steps for to reach 1 are
:0, 1, 7, 2, 5, 8, 16, 3, 19, 6, 14, 9, 9, 17, 17, 4, 12, 20, 20, 7, 7, 15, 15, 10, 23, 10, 111, 18, 18, 18, 106, 5, 26, 13, 13, 21, 21, 21, 34, 8, 109, 8, 29, 16, 16, 16, 104, 11, 24, 24, ... 

The starting value having the largest total stopping time while being
:less than 10 is 9, which has 19 steps,
:less than 100 is 97, which has 118 steps,
:less than 1000 is 871, which has 178 steps,
:less than 104 is 6171, which has 261 steps,
:less than 105 is , which has 350 steps,
:less than 106 is , which has 524 steps,
:less than 107 is , which has 685 steps,
:less than 108 is , which has 949 steps,
:less than 109 is , which has 986 steps,
:less than 1010 is , which has 1132 steps,
:less than 1011 is , which has 1228 steps,
:less than 1012 is , which has 1348 steps. 

These numbers are the lowest ones with the indicated step count, but not necessarily the only ones below the given limit. As an example, has 1132 steps, as does .

The starting values having the smallest total stopping time with respect to their number of digits (in base 2) are the powers of two since is halved times to reach 1, and is never increased.

==Visualizations==
==Supporting arguments==
Although the conjecture has not been proven, most mathematicians who have looked into the problem think the conjecture is true because experimental evidence and heuristic arguments support it.

===Experimental evidence===
The conjecture has been checked by computer for all starting values up to 268 ≈ . All values tested so far converge to 1.

This computer evidence is still not rigorous proof that the conjecture is true for all starting values, as counterexamples may be found when considering very large (or possibly immense) positive integers, as in the case of the disproven Pólya conjecture and Mertens conjecture.

However, such verifications may have other implications. Certain constraints on any non-trivial cycle, such as lower bounds on the length of the cycle, can be proven based on the value of the lowest term in the cycle. Therefore, computer searches to rule out cycles that have a small lowest term can strengthen these constraints.

===A probabilistic heuristic===
If one considers only the &quot;odd&quot; numbers in the sequence generated by the Collatz process, then each odd number is on average of the previous one. (More precisely, the geometric mean of the ratios of outcomes is .) This yields a heuristic argument that every Hailstone sequence should decrease in the long run, although this is not evidence against other cycles, only against divergence. The argument is not a proof because it assumes that Hailstone sequences are assembled from uncorrelated probabilistic events. (It does rigorously establish that the 2-adic extension of the Collatz process has two division steps for every multiplication step for almost all 2-adic starting values.)

===Stopping times===
As proven by Riho Terras, almost every positive integer has a finite stopping time. In other words, almost every Collatz sequence reaches a point that is strictly below its initial value. The proof is based on the distribution of parity vectors and uses the central limit theorem.

In 2019, Terence Tao improved this result by showing, using logarithmic density, that almost all (in the sense of logarithmic density) Collatz orbits are descending below any given function of the starting point, provided that this function diverges to infinity, no matter how slowly. Responding to this work, &quot;Quanta Magazine&quot; wrote that Tao &quot;came away with one of the most significant results on the Collatz conjecture in decades&quot;.

===Lower bounds===
In a computer-aided proof, Krasikov and Lagarias showed that the number of integers in the interval that eventually reach 1 is at least equal to for all sufficiently large .

==Cycles==
In this part, consider the shortcut form of the Collatz function
formula_7
A cycle is a sequence of distinct positive integers where , , ..., and .

The only known cycle is of period 2, called the trivial cycle.

===Cycle length===
The length of a non-trivial cycle is known to be at least (or without shortcut). If it can be shown that for all positive integers less than formula_8 the Collatz sequences reach 1, then this bound would raise to ( without shortcut). In fact, Eliahou (1993) proved that the period of any non-trivial cycle is of the form
formula_9
where , and are non-negative integers, and . This result is based on the simple continued fraction expansion of .

===-cycles===
A -cycle is a cycle that can be partitioned into contiguous subsequences, each consisting of an increasing sequence of odd numbers, followed by a decreasing sequence of even numbers. For instance, if the cycle consists of a single increasing sequence of odd numbers followed by a decreasing sequence of even numbers, it is called a &quot;1-cycle&quot;.

Steiner (1977) proved that there is no 1-cycle other than the trivial . Simons (2005) used Steiner&#x27;s method to prove that there is no 2-cycle. Simons and de Weger (2005) extended this proof up to 68-cycles; there is no -cycle up to . Hercher extended the method further and proved that there exists no &quot;k&quot;-cycle with . As exhaustive computer searches continue, larger values may be ruled out. To state the argument more intuitively; we do not have to search for cycles that have less than 92 subsequences, where each subsequence consists of consecutive ups followed by consecutive downs.

==Other formulations of the conjecture==

===In reverse===

There is another approach to prove the conjecture, which considers the bottom-up
method of growing the so-called &quot;Collatz graph&quot;. The &quot;Collatz graph&quot; is a graph defined by the inverse relation
formula_10

So, instead of proving that all positive integers eventually lead to 1, we can try to prove that 1 leads backwards to all positive integers. For any integer , if and only if . Equivalently, if and only if . Conjecturally, this inverse relation forms a tree except for the 1–2–4 loop (the inverse of the 4–2–1 loop of the unaltered function defined in the Statement of the problem section of this article).

When the relation of the function is replaced by the common substitute &quot;shortcut&quot; relation , the Collatz graph is defined by the inverse relation,
formula_11

For any integer , if and only if . Equivalently, if and only if . Conjecturally, this inverse relation forms a tree except for a 1–2 loop (the inverse of the 1–2 loop of the function f(n) revised as indicated above).

Alternatively, replace the with where and is the highest power of 2 that divides (with no remainder). The resulting function maps from odd numbers to odd numbers. Now suppose that for some odd number , applying this operation times yields the number 1 (that is, ). Then in binary, the number can be written as the concatenation of strings where each is a finite and contiguous extract from the representation of . The representation of therefore holds the repetends of , where each repetend is optionally rotated and then replicated up to a finite number of bits. It is only in binary that this occurs. Conjecturally, every binary string that ends with a &#x27;1&#x27; can be reached by a representation of this form (where we may add or delete leading &#x27;0&#x27;s to ).

===As an abstract machine that computes in base two===
Repeated applications of the Collatz function can be represented as an abstract machine that handles strings of bits. The machine will perform the following three steps on any odd number until only one remains:

# Append to the (right) end of the number in binary (giving );
# Add this to the original number by binary addition (giving );
# Remove all trailing s (that is, repeatedly divide by 2 until the result is odd).

====Example====
The starting number 7 is written in base two as . The resulting Collatz sequence is:
 111
 1111
 10110
 10111
 100010
 100011
 110100
 11011
 101000
 1011
 10000
===As a parity sequence===
For this section, consider the shortcut form of the Collatz function
formula_12

If is the parity of a number, that is and , then we can define the Collatz parity sequence (or parity vector) for a number as , where , and .

Which operation is performed, or , depends on the parity. The parity sequence is the same as the sequence of operations.

Using this form for , it can be shown that the parity sequences for two numbers and will agree in the first terms if and only if and are equivalent modulo . This implies that every number is uniquely identified by its parity sequence, and moreover that if there are multiple Hailstone cycles, then their corresponding parity cycles must be different.

Applying the function times to the number will give the result , where is the result of applying the function times to , and is how many increases were encountered during that sequence. For example, for there are 3 increases as 1 iterates to 2, 1, 2, 1, and finally to 2 so the result is ; for there is only 1 increase as 1 rises to 2 and falls to 1 so the result is . When is then there will be rises and the result will be . The power of 3 multiplying is independent of the value of ; it depends only on the behavior of . This allows one to predict that certain forms of numbers will always lead to a smaller number after a certain number of iterations: for example, becomes after two applications of and becomes after four applications of . Whether those smaller numbers continue to 1, however, depends on the value of .

===As a tag system===
For the Collatz function in the shortcut form

formula_13

Hailstone sequences can be computed by the 2-tag system with production rules

In this system, the positive integer is represented by a string of copies of , and iteration of the tag operation halts on any word of length less than 2. (Adapted from De Mol.)

The Collatz conjecture equivalently states that this tag system, with an arbitrary finite string of as the initial word, eventually halts (see &quot;Tag system&quot; for a worked example).

==Extensions to larger domains==

===Iterating on all integers===
An extension to the Collatz conjecture is to include all integers, not just positive integers. Leaving aside the cycle 0 → 0 which cannot be entered from outside, there are a total of four known cycles, which all nonzero integers seem to eventually fall into under iteration of . These cycles are listed here, starting with the well-known cycle for positive :

Odd values are listed in large bold. Each cycle is listed with its member of least absolute value (which is always odd) first.

The generalized Collatz conjecture is the assertion that every integer, under iteration by , eventually falls into one of the four cycles above or the cycle 0 → 0.

=== Iterating on rationals with odd denominators ===
The Collatz map can be extended to (positive or negative) rational numbers which have odd denominators when written in lowest terms.
The number is taken to be &#x27;odd&#x27; or &#x27;even&#x27; according to whether its numerator is odd or even. Then the formula for the map is exactly the same as when the domain is the integers: an &#x27;even&#x27; such rational is divided by 2; an &#x27;odd&#x27; such rational is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. A closely related fact is that the Collatz map extends to the ring of 2-adic integers, which contains the ring of rationals with odd denominators as a subring.

When using the &quot;shortcut&quot; definition of the Collatz map, it is known that any periodic parity sequence is generated by exactly one rational. Conversely, it is conjectured that every rational with an odd denominator has an eventually cyclic parity sequence (Periodicity Conjecture).

If a parity cycle has length and includes odd numbers exactly times at indices , then the unique rational which generates immediately and periodically this parity cycle is
}{2^n - 3^m}.&lt;/math&gt;|}}

For example, the parity cycle has length 7 and four odd terms at indices 0, 2, 3, and 6. It is repeatedly generated by the fraction
formula_14
as the latter leads to the rational cycle
formula_15

Any cyclic permutation of is associated to one of the above fractions. For instance, the cycle is produced by the fraction
formula_16

For a one-to-one correspondence, a parity cycle should be &quot;irreducible&quot;, that is, not partitionable into identical sub-cycles. As an illustration of this, the parity cycle and its sub-cycle are associated to the same fraction when reduced to lowest terms.

In this context, assuming the validity of the Collatz conjecture implies that and are the only parity cycles generated by positive whole numbers (1 and 2, respectively).

If the odd denominator of a rational is not a multiple of 3, then all the iterates have the same denominator and the sequence of numerators can be obtained by applying the &quot; &quot; generalization of the Collatz function
formula_17

===2-adic extension===
The function
formula_18
is well-defined on the ring formula_19 of 2-adic integers, where it is continuous and measure-preserving with respect to the 2-adic measure. Moreover, its dynamics is known to be ergodic.

Define the &quot;parity vector&quot; function acting on formula_19 as
formula_21

The function is a 2-adic isometry. Consequently, every infinite parity sequence occurs for exactly one 2-adic integer, so that almost all trajectories are acyclic in formula_19.

An equivalent formulation of the Collatz conjecture is that
formula_23

===Iterating on real or complex numbers===
The Collatz map can be extended to the real line by choosing any function which evaluates to formula_24 when formula_25 is an even integer, and to either formula_26 or formula_27 (for the &quot;shortcut&quot; version) when formula_25 is an odd integer. This is called an interpolating function. A simple way to do this is to pick two functions formula_29 and formula_30, where:
:formula_31
:formula_32
and use them as switches for our desired values:
:formula_33.
One such choice is formula_34 and formula_35. The iterations of this map lead to a dynamical system, further investigated by Marc Chamberland. He showed that the conjecture does not hold for positive real numbers since there are infinitely many fixed points, as well as orbits escaping monotonically to infinity. The function formula_36 has two attracting cycles of period formula_37: formula_38 and formula_39. Moreover, the set of unbounded orbits is conjectured to be of measure formula_40.

Letherman, Schleicher, and Wood extended the study to the complex plane. They used Chamberland&#x27;s function for complex sine and cosine and added the extra term formula_41
formula_42, where formula_43 is any entire function. Since this expression evaluates to zero for real integers, the extended function
:formula_44

is an interpolation of the Collatz map to the complex plane. The reason for adding the extra term is to make all integers critical points of formula_36. With this, they show that no integer is in a Baker domain, which implies that any integer is either eventually periodic or belongs to a wandering domain. They conjectured that the latter is not the case, which would make all integer orbits finite.

Most of the points have orbits that diverge to infinity. Coloring these points based on how fast they diverge produces the image on the left, for formula_46. The inner black regions and the outer region are the Fatou components, and the boundary between them is the Julia set of formula_36, which forms a fractal pattern, sometimes called a &quot;Collatz fractal&quot;.

There are many other ways to define a complex interpolating function, such as using the complex exponential instead of sine and cosine:
:formula_48,
which exhibit different dynamics. In this case, for instance, if formula_49, then formula_50. The corresponding Julia set, shown on the right, consists of uncountably many curves, called &quot;hairs&quot;, or &quot;rays&quot;.

==Optimizations==
===Time–space tradeoff===
The section &quot;As a parity sequence&quot; above gives a way to speed up simulation of the sequence. To jump ahead steps on each iteration (using the function from that section), break up the current number into two parts, (the least significant bits, interpreted as an integer), and (the rest of the bits as an integer). The result of jumping ahead is given by
The values of (or better ) and can be precalculated for all possible -bit numbers , where is the result of applying the function times to , and is the number of odd numbers encountered on the way. For example, if , one can jump ahead 5 steps on each iteration by separating out the 5 least significant bits of a number and using

: (0...31, 5) = { 0, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 3, 4, 5 },
: (0...31, 5) = { 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 20, 1, 26, 1, 10, 4, 4, 13, 40, 2, 5, 17, 17, 2, 2, 20, 20, 8, 22, 8, 71, 26, 26, 80, 242 }.

This requires precomputation and storage to speed up the resulting calculation by a factor of , a space–time tradeoff.

===Modular restrictions===
For the special purpose of searching for a counterexample to the Collatz conjecture, this precomputation leads to an even more important acceleration, used by Tomás Oliveira e Silva in his computational confirmations of the Collatz conjecture up to large values of . If, for some given and , the inequality

holds for all , then the first counterexample, if it exists, cannot be modulo . For instance, the first counterexample must be odd because , smaller than ; and it must be 3 mod 4 because , smaller than . For each starting value which is not a counterexample to the Collatz conjecture, there is a for which such an inequality holds, so checking the Collatz conjecture for one starting value is as good as checking an entire congruence class. As increases, the search only needs to check those residues that are not eliminated by lower values of . Only an exponentially small fraction of the residues survive. For example, the only surviving residues mod 32 are 7, 15, 27, and 31.

Integers divisible by 3 cannot form a cycle, so these integers do not need to be checked as counter examples.

==Syracuse function==
If is an odd integer, then is even, so with odd and . The Syracuse function is the function from the set of positive odd integers into itself, for which .

Some properties of the Syracuse function are:

* For all , . (Because .)

The Collatz conjecture is equivalent to the statement that, for all in , there exists an integer such that .

== Undecidable generalizations ==
In 1972, John Horton Conway proved that a natural generalization of the Collatz problem is algorithmically undecidable.

Specifically, he considered functions of the form
formula_51
where are rational numbers which are so chosen that is always an integer. The standard Collatz function is given by , , , , . Conway proved that the problem

: Given and , does the sequence of iterates reach ?

is undecidable, by representing the halting problem in this way.

Closer to the Collatz problem is the following &quot;universally quantified&quot; problem:

: Given , does the sequence of iterates reach , for all ?

Modifying the condition in this way can make a problem either harder or easier to solve (intuitively, it is harder to justify a positive answer but might be easier to justify a negative one). Kurtz and Simon proved that the universally quantified problem is, in fact, undecidable and even higher in the arithmetical hierarchy; specifically, it is -complete. This hardness result holds even if one restricts the class of functions by fixing the modulus to 6480.

Iterations of in a simplified version of this form, with all formula_52 equal to zero, are formalized in an esoteric programming language called FRACTRAN.

==In computational complexity==
Collatz and related conjectures are often used when studying computation complexity. The connection is made through the Busy Beaver function, where BB(n) is the maximum number of steps taken by any n state Turing machine that halts. There is a 15 state Turing machine that halts if and only if a conjecture by Paul Erdős (closely related to the Collatz conjecture) is false. Hence if BB(15) was known, and this machine did not stop in that number of steps, it would be known to run forever and hence no counterexamples exist (which proves the conjecture true). This is a completely impractical way to settle the conjecture; instead it is used to suggest that BB(15) will be very hard to compute, at least as difficult as settling this Collatz-like conjecture.

<text>Cyprian (; ; to 14 September 258 AD) was a bishop of Carthage and an early Christian writer of Berber descent, many of whose Latin works are extant. He is recognized as a saint in the Western and Eastern churches.

He was born around the beginning of the 3rd century in North Africa, perhaps at Carthage, where he received a classical education. Soon after converting to Christianity, he became a bishop in 249. A controversial figure during his lifetime, his strong pastoral skills, firm conduct during the Novatianist controversy and outbreak of the Plague of Cyprian (named for his description of it), and eventual martyrdom at Carthage established his reputation and proved his sanctity in the eyes of the Church.

His skilful Latin rhetoric led to his being considered the pre-eminent Latin writer of Western Christianity until Jerome and Augustine.

== Early life ==
Cyprian was born into a rich pagan Roman African Carthaginian family sometime during the early third century. His original name was Thascius; he took the additional name Caecilius in memory of the priest to whom he owed his conversion. Before his conversion, he was a leading member of a legal fraternity in Carthage, an orator, a &quot;pleader in the courts&quot;, and a teacher of rhetoric. After a &quot;dissipated youth&quot;, Cyprian was baptized when he was thirty-five years old, 245 AD. After his baptism, he gave away a portion of his wealth to the poor of Carthage, as befitted a man of his status.

In the early days of his conversion, he wrote an &quot;Epistola ad Donatum de gratia Dei&quot; and the &quot;Testimoniorum Libri III&quot; that adhere closely to the models of Tertullian, who influenced his style and thinking. Cyprian described his own conversion and baptism in the following words:

== Contested election as bishop of Carthage ==
Not long after his baptism, he was ordained a deacon and soon afterwards a priest. Sometime between July 248 and April 249, he was elected bishop of Carthage, a popular choice among the poor who remembered his patronage as demonstrating good equestrian style. However, his rapid rise did not meet with the approval of senior members of the clergy in Carthage, an opposition that did not disappear during his episcopate.

Not long afterwards, the entire community was put to an unwanted test. Christians in North Africa had not suffered persecution for many years; the Church was assured and lax. In early 250, the Decian persecution began. Emperor Decius issued an edict, the text of which is lost, ordering sacrifices to the gods to be made throughout the Empire. Jews were specifically exempted from that requirement. Cyprian chose to go into hiding, rather than face potential execution. While some clergy saw that decision as a sign of cowardice, Cyprian defended himself by saying that he had fled in order not to leave the faithful without a shepherd during the persecution and that his decision to continue to lead them, although from a distance, was in accordance with divine will. Moreover, he pointed to the actions of the Apostles and Jesus himself: &quot;And therefore the Lord commanded us in the persecution to depart and to flee; and both taught that this should be done, and Himself did it. For as the crown is given by the condescension of God, and cannot be received unless the hour comes for accepting it, whoever abiding in Christ departs for a while does not deny his faith, but waits for the time...&quot;.

== Controversy over the lapsed ==
The persecution was especially severe at Carthage, according to Church sources. Many Christians fell away and were thereafter referred to as &quot;Lapsi&quot; (&quot;fallen&quot;). The majority had obtained signed statements (&quot;libelli&quot;) certifying that they had sacrificed to the Roman gods to avoid persecution or confiscation of property. In some cases, Christians had actually sacrificed, whether under torture or otherwise. Cyprian found those &quot;libellatici&quot; especially cowardly and demanded that they and the rest of the &quot;lapsi&quot; undergo public penance before being readmitted to the Church.

However, in Cyprian&#x27;s absence, some priests disregarded his wishes by readmitting the lapsed to communion with little or no public penance. Some of the &quot;lapsi&quot; presented a second &quot;libellus&quot; purported to bear the signature of some martyr or confessor who, it was held, had the spiritual prestige to reaffirm individual Christians. That system was not limited to Carthage, but on a wider front by its charismatic nature, it clearly constituted a challenge to institutional authority in the Church, in particular to that of the bishop. Hundreds or even thousands of &quot;lapsi&quot; were readmitted that way against the express wishes of Cyprian and the majority of the Carthaginian clergy, who insisted upon earnest repentance.

A schism then broke out in Carthage, as the laxist party, led largely by the priests who had opposed Cyprian&#x27;s election, attempted to block measures taken by him during his period of absence. After fourteen months, Cyprian returned to the diocese and in letters addressed to the other North African bishops defended having left his post. After issuing a tract, &quot;De lapsis&quot; (&quot;On the Fallen&quot;), he convoked a council of North African bishops at Carthage to consider the treatment of the lapsed and the apparent schism of Felicissimus (251). Cyprian took a middle course between the followers of Novatus of Carthage, who were in favour of welcoming back all with little or no penance, and Novatian of Rome, who would not allow any of those who had lapsed to be reconciled. The council in the main sided with Cyprian and condemned Felicissimus though no acts of that council survive.

The schism continued as the laxists elected a certain Fortunatus as bishop in opposition to Cyprian. At the same time, the rigorist party in Rome, who refused reconciliation to any of the lapsed, elected Novatian as bishop of Rome in opposition to Pope Cornelius. The Novatianists also secured the election of a certain Maximus as a rival bishop of their own at Carthage. Cyprian now found himself wedged between laxists and rigorists, but the polarisation highlighted the firm but moderate position adopted by Cyprian and strengthened his influence by wearing down the numbers of his opponents. Moreover, his dedication during the time of a great plague and famine gained him still further popular support.

Cyprian comforted his brethren by writing his &quot;De mortalitate&quot; and in his &quot;De eleemosynis&quot; exhorted them to active charity towards the poor and set a personal example. He defended Christianity and the Christians in the &quot;apologia&quot; &quot;Ad Demetrianum&quot;, directed against a certain Demetrius, and countered pagan claims that Christians were the cause of the public calamities.

== Persecution under Valerian ==

In late 256, a new persecution of the Christians broke out under Emperor Valerian, and Pope Sixtus II was executed in Rome.

In Africa, Cyprian prepared his people for the expected edict of persecution by his &quot;De exhortatione martyrii&quot; and set an example when he was brought before the Roman proconsul Aspasius Paternus (30 August 257). He refused to sacrifice to the pagan deities and firmly professed Christ.

The proconsul banished him to Curubis, now Korba, where, to the best of his ability, he comforted his flock and his banished clergy. In a vision, he believed he saw his approaching fate. When a year had passed, he was recalled and kept practically a prisoner in his own villa in expectation of severe measures after a new and more stringent imperial edict arrived, which Christian writers subsequently claimed demanded the execution of all Christian clerics.

On 13 September 258, Cyprian was imprisoned on the orders of the new proconsul, Galerius Maximus. The public examination of Cyprian by Galerius Maximus, on 14 September 258, has been preserved:
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Galerius Maximus&quot;: &quot;Are you Thascius Cyprianus?&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Cyprian&quot;: &quot;I am.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Galerius&quot;: &quot;The most sacred Emperors have commanded you to conform to the Roman rites.&quot; 
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Cyprian&quot;: &quot;I refuse.&quot; 
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Galerius&quot;: &quot;Take heed for yourself.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Cyprian&quot;: &quot;Do as you are bid; in so clear a case I may not take heed.&quot; 
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Galerius&quot;, after briefly conferring with his judicial council, with much reluctance pronounced the following sentence: &quot;You have long lived an irreligious life, and have drawn together a number of men bound by an unlawful association, and professed yourself an open enemy to the gods and the religion of Rome; and the pious, most sacred and august Emperors ... have endeavoured in vain to bring you back to conformity with their religious observances; whereas therefore you have been apprehended as principal and ringleader in these infamous crimes, you shall be made an example to those whom you have wickedly associated with you; the authority of law shall be ratified in your blood.&quot; He then read the sentence of the court from a written tablet: &quot;It is the sentence of this court that Thascius Cyprianus be executed with the sword.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Cyprian&quot;: &quot;Thanks be to God.&quot;

The execution was carried out at once in an open place near the city. A vast multitude followed Cyprian on his last journey. He removed his garments without assistance, knelt down, and prayed. After he blindfolded himself, he was beheaded by the sword. The body was interred by Christians near the place of execution.

Cyprian&#x27;s martyrdom was followed by the martyrdom of eight of his disciples in Carthage.

== Writings ==

Cyprian&#x27;s works were edited in volumes 3 and 4 of the &quot;Patrologia Latina.&quot; He was not a speculative theologian, his writings being always related to his pastoral ministry. The first major work was a monologue spoken to a friend called &quot;Ad Donatum,&quot; detailing his own conversion, the corruption of Roman government and the gladiatorial spectacles, and pointing to prayer as &quot;the only refuge of the Christian&quot;. Another early written work was the &quot;Testimonia ad Quirinum&quot;. During his exile from Carthage Cyprian wrote his most famous treatise, &quot;De Ecclesiae Catholicae Unitate&quot; (&quot;On the Unity of the Catholic Church&quot;) and on returning to his see, he issued &quot;De Lapsis&quot; (&quot;On the Fallen&quot;). Another important work is his &quot;Treatise on the Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot;. Doubtless only part of his written output has survived, and this must apply especially to his correspondence, of which some sixty letters are extant, in addition to some of the letters he received.

Cyprian of Carthage is often confused with Cyprian of Antioch, reputedly a magician before his conversion. A number of grimoires, such as &quot;Libellus Magicus&quot;, are thus mistakenly attributed to Cyprian of Carthage.

== Biography ==
Pontius the Deacon wrote a biography of Cyprian titled &quot;The Life and Passion of St. Cyprian&quot;, which details the saint&#x27;s early life, his conversion, notable acts, and martyrdom under Valerian.

== Theology ==

=== Sacraments ===
Cyprian believed in infant baptism and infant communion. Cyprian, however, spoke against the efficacy of baptism performed by heretics and insisted on their rebaptism, and he believed that the Eucharist cannot be properly consecrated outside the Church.

Cyprian was one of the earliest of the Church Fathers to enunciate clearly and unambiguously the doctrine of baptismal regeneration (&quot;the idea that salvation happens at and by water baptism duly administered&quot;): &quot;While he attributed all the saving energy to the grace of God, he considered the &#x27;laver of saving water&#x27; the instrument of God that makes a person &#x27;born again,&#x27; receiving a new life and putting off what he had previously been. The &#x27;water of new birth&#x27; animated him to new life by the Spirit of holiness working through it.&quot;

=== Church ===
Cyprian believed that the lapsed could be re-admitted to the Church after penance and he opposed the Novatians.

Cyprian believed the see of Peter (Rome) is the direct heir of Peter. While Cyprian believed that all the apostles were equal and that all the bishops followed the Apostles in succession, Cyprian emphasized the unity of the Church under a single &quot;cathedra&quot; (chair): &quot;he [Jesus Christ] assigns a like power to all the apostles, yet he founded a single chair [&quot;cathedra&quot;], and he established by his own authority a source and an intrinsic reason for that unity. Indeed, the others were that also which Peter was [i.e., apostles], but a primacy is given to Peter, whereby it is made clear that there is but one Church and one chair. So too, all [the apostles] are shepherds, and the flock is shown to be one, fed by all the apostles in single-minded accord.&quot;

=== Other ===
Cyprian was amillennial. Augustine argued that Cyprian taught the gift of perseverance. Cyprian argued that each day of the Genesis creation account consisted of 1,000 years.

== Veneration ==
Churches were erected over his tomb and over the place of his death. In later centuries, however, these churches were destroyed by the Vandals. The graves of such saints as Cyprian and Martin of Tours came to be regarded as &quot;contact points between Heaven and Earth&quot;, and they became the centres of new, redefined, Christian urban communities. A surviving homily from Augustine on Cyprian&#x27;s feast day indicates that his following was fairly widespread throughout Africa by the fourth century.

Charlemagne is said to have had the bones transferred to France; and Lyons, Arles, Venice, Compiègne, and Roenay in Flanders all have claimed to possess part of the martyr&#x27;s relics.

The Catholic Church celebrates his feast day together with that of his good friend Pope Cornelius on 16 September, and in the Catholic Middle Ages the Sarum use observed it on the day of his death, 14 September. The Eastern Orthodox Church commemorates him on 31 August. Lutherans now commemorate him on 16 September, while Anglicans celebrate his feast usually either on 13 September (e.g. the Anglican Church of Australia) or 15 September (the present-day Church of England Calendar of saints) remembers him with a Lesser Festival.

<doc id="37901" wikidata="Q157819" url="?curid=37901" title="Valerian (herb)">
<text>Valerian (Valeriana officinalis, Caprifoliaceae) is a perennial flowering plant native to Eurasia. It produces a catnip-like response in cats.

Crude extract of valerian root may have sedative and anxiolytic effects, and is commonly sold in dietary supplement capsules to promote sleep, but clinical evidence that it is effective for this purpose is weak or inconclusive.

==Names==
The name of the herb is derived from the personal name &quot;Valeria&quot; and the Latin verb (to be strong, healthy). Other names used for this plant include garden valerian (to distinguish it from other &quot;Valeriana&quot; species), garden heliotrope (although not related to &quot;Heliotropium&quot;), setwall and all-heal (which is also used for plants in the genus &quot;Stachys&quot;). Red valerian, often grown in gardens, is also sometimes referred to as &quot;valerian&quot;, but is a different species (&quot;Centranthus ruber&quot;), from the same family but not very closely related. Valerian is also called cat&#x27;s love for its catnip-like effects.

== Description ==
The plant grows up to tall and 1 m wide. The erect stems are unbranched, with pinnately divided, toothed leaves. The flowers are light pink, grouped in both compound and secondary clusters.

In the summer the mature plant can bear sweetly scented pink or white flowers.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The plant is native to Europe and Asia. It is widespread in Britain.

== Ecology ==
The flowers attract many fly species, especially hoverflies of the genus &quot;Eristalis&quot;. The plant is consumed as food by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species, including the grey pug.

=== As an invasive species ===
Valerian is considered an invasive species in many locations outside its natural range, including the U.S. state of Connecticut where it is officially banned, and in New Brunswick, Canada, where it is listed as a plant of concern.

=== Effect on cats ===
Valerian root is a cat attractant, containing attractant semiochemicals in a way similar to catnip, which can lead to a behaviour modification effect in cats. Its roots and leaves are one of three alternatives for the one-third of domesticated or medium-sized cats who do not feel the effects of catnip. Valerian root has also been reported to be attractive to rats and used to attract members of the family Canidae to traps.

== Valerian extract ==

=== Phytochemicals ===
Known compounds detected in valerian include:
* Alkaloids: actinidine, chatinine, shyanthine, valerianine, and valerine
* Isovaleramide may be created in the extraction process.
* Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
* Valeric acid 
* Isovaleric acid
* Iridoids, including valepotriates: isovaltrate and valtrate
* Sesquiterpenes (contained in the volatile oil): valerenic acid, hydroxyvalerenic acid and acetoxyvalerenic acid
* Flavanones: hesperidin, 6-methylapigenin, and linarin

=== Preparation ===
The chief constituent of valerian is a yellowish-green to brownish-yellow oil present in the dried root, varying in content from 0.5 to 2.0%. This variation in quantity may be determined by location; a dry, stony soil yields a root richer in oil than moist, fertile soil.

===Traditional medicine===

Although valerian is a common traditional medicine used for treating insomnia, there is no good evidence it is effective for this purpose. Valerian has not been shown to be helpful in treating restless leg syndrome or anxiety.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the health claim that valerian can be used as a traditional herb to relieve mild nervous tension and to aid sleep; the EMA stated that although there is insufficient evidence from clinical studies, its effectiveness as a dried extract is considered plausible.

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine&#x27;s 2017 clinical practice guidelines recommended against the use of valerian in the treatment of insomnia due to poor effectiveness and low quality of evidence.

==== Oral forms ====

Oral forms are available in both standardized and unstandardized forms. Standardized products may be preferable considering the wide variation of the chemicals in the dried root, as noted above. When standardized, it is done so as a percentage of valerenic acid or valeric acid. For commonly used doses, valerian is generally recognized as safe in the U.S.

==== Adverse effects ====
Because the compounds in valerian produce central nervous system depression, they should not be used with other depressants, such as ethanol (drinking alcohol), benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates, kava, or antihistamine drugs.

As an unregulated product, the concentration, contents, and potential contaminants in valerian preparations cannot be easily determined. Because of this uncertainty and the potential for toxicity in the fetus and hepatotoxicity in the mother, valerian use is discouraged during pregnancy. Headache and diarrhea have occurred among subjects using valerian in clinical studies.

== Other uses ==
The young leaves can be cooked and the roots can be infused in hot beverages like hot chocolate.

== In culture ==

Valerian has been used as a herb in traditional medicine since at least the times of ancient Greece and Rome. Hippocrates described its properties, and Galen later prescribed it as a remedy for insomnia. In medieval Sweden, it was sometimes placed in the wedding clothes of a bridegroom to ward off the &quot;envy&quot; of the elves. In the 16th century, Pilgram Marpeck prescribed valerian tea for a sick woman.

John Gerard&#x27;s &quot;Herball, or Generall Historie of Plantes&quot;, first published in 1597, states that his contemporaries found valerian &quot;excellent for those burdened and for such as be troubled with croup and other like convulsions, and also for those that are bruised with falls&quot;. He says that the dried root was valued as a medicine by the poor in the north of England and the south of Scotland, such that &quot;no brothes, pottages or phisicalle meates are woorth [worth] anything if Setwall [valerian] were not at one end&quot;.

The 17th-century astrological botanist Nicholas Culpeper thought the plant was &quot;under the influence of Mercury, and therefore hath a warming faculty&quot;. He recommended both herb and root, and said that &quot;the root boiled with liquorice, raisons and aniseed is good for those troubled with cough. Also, it is of special value against the plague, the decoction thereof being drunk and the root smelled. The green herb being bruised and applied to the head taketh away pain and pricking thereof.&quot;

<text>La traviata (; &quot;The Fallen Woman&quot;) is an opera in three acts by Giuseppe Verdi set to an Italian libretto by Francesco Maria Piave. It is based on &quot;La Dame aux camélias&quot; (1852), a play by Alexandre Dumas &quot;fils&quot;, which he adapted from his own 1848 novel. The opera was originally titled Violetta, after the main character. It was first performed on 6 March 1853 at La Fenice opera house in Venice.

Piave and Verdi wanted to follow Dumas in giving the opera a contemporary setting, but the authorities at La Fenice insisted that it be set in the past, &quot;c. 1700&quot;. It was not until the 1880s that the composer&#x27;s and librettist&#x27;s original wishes were carried out and &quot;realistic&quot; productions were staged. &quot;La traviata&quot; has become immensely popular and is among the most frequently performed of all operas.

==Composition history==

For Verdi, the years 1851 to 1853 were filled with operatic activity. First, he had agreed with the librettist Salvadore Cammarano on a subject for what would become &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, but work on this opera could not proceed while the composer was writing &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, which premiered in Venice in March 1851. In addition, personal affairs in his home town limited his activities that spring, but after &quot;Rigoletto&quot;″s success in Venice, an additional commission was offered by Brenna, the secretary of La Fenice.

===Verdi sees &quot;The Lady of the Camellias&quot; play===

Verdi and Giuseppina Strepponi visited Paris from late 1851 and into March 1852. In February the couple attended a performance of Alexander Dumas &quot;fils&quot;″s &quot;The Lady of the Camellias&quot;. As a result of this, Verdi&#x27;s biographer Mary Jane Phillips-Matz reports, the composer immediately began to compose music for what would later become &quot;La traviata&quot;. However, Julian Budden notes that Verdi had probably read the Dumas novel some time before, and, after seeing the play and returning to Italy, &quot;he was already setting up an ideal operatic cast for it in his mind&quot;, shown by his dealings with La Fenice.

===Composing for Venice===

Francesco Maria Piave was engaged to write the new libretto and the two men tried to come up with a suitable subject, but the composer complained that his librettist &quot;had not yet offered him an &#x27;original&#x27; or &#x27;provocative&#x27; idea&quot;. Writing to Piave, he added that &quot;I don&#x27;t want any of those everyday subjects that one can find by the hundreds.&quot; But at the same time, the composer expressed concern about censorship in Venice, something with which he was very familiar after his dealings with the censors concerning &quot;Rigoletto&quot;. As the months dragged on into October, it was agreed that Piave would come to Sant&#x27;Agata (Verdi&#x27;s home near Busseto) and work with the composer. One subject was chosen, Piave set to work, and then Verdi threw in another idea, which may have been &quot;La traviata&quot;. Within a short time, a synopsis was dispatched to Venice under the title of &quot;Amore e morte&quot; (&quot;Love and Death&quot;). However, Verdi wrote to his friend De Sanctis telling him that &quot;for Venice I&#x27;m doing &quot;La Dame aux camélias&quot; which will probably be called &quot;La traviata&quot;. A subject for our own age.&quot; Although still bogged down at Sant&#x27;Agata, Piave was sanguine: &quot;Everything will turn out fine, and we&#x27;ll have a new masterpiece from this true wizard of modern harmonies&quot;.

When back at Sant&#x27;Agata in late January 1853 Verdi was reminded that his contract called for him to be in Venice within a week or two and for the premiere to be held on the &quot;first Saturday in March 1853&quot;. However, it soon became clear that a modern-dress staging of the new opera was impossible—the requirement was that it should be set in the 17th century &quot;in the era of Richelieu&quot;—and reports from the opening of the season confirmed the limitations of the chosen soprano, the 38-year-old Fanny Salvini-Donatelli for taking the role of Violetta. Verdi was distraught, for he held on to the notion that the opera could be staged in modern dress—as &quot;Stiffelio&quot; had been done—Piave was sent back to Sant&#x27;Agata to no avail: he could not persuade the composer to back down on his insistence that another soprano be secured, yet the 15 January deadline for securing one had come and gone. Verdi was filled with premonitions of disaster upon his arrival in Venice on 21 February for rehearsals and he made his unhappiness clear to the singers.

==Performance history==

The audience jeered at times during the premiere, directing some of their scorn at the casting of soprano Fanny Salvini-Donatelli in the lead role of Violetta. Though she was an acclaimed singer, they considered her to be too old (at 38) and overweight to credibly play a young woman dying of consumption. (Verdi had previously attempted to persuade the manager of La Fenice to re-cast the role with a younger woman, but with no success.) Nevertheless, the first act was met with applause and cheering at the end; but in the second act, the audience began to turn against the performance, especially after the singing of the baritone Felice Varesi and the tenor Lodovico Graziani. The next day, Verdi wrote to his friend Emanuele Muzio in what has now become perhaps his most famous letter: &quot;&quot;La traviata&quot; last night a failure. Was the fault mine or the singers&#x27;? Time will tell.&quot;

Coincidentally, as Philips-Matz points out, an Italian translation of the play &quot;La Dame aux camélias&quot; was being presented just a short distance from La Fenice.
While there were demands for productions from impresarios in various Italian cities, Verdi was loath to allow them unless he could be sure of the strength of the singers, and in spite of their pleas, the composer refused. As Budden notes, it came to be Venice &quot;that made an honest woman of Violetta&quot; when Verdi allowed a performance at the Teatro San Benedetto. Some revisions took place between 1853 and May 1854, mostly affecting acts 2 and 3, but the opera was performed again on 6 May 1854 and was a great success, largely due to Maria Spezia-Aldighieri&#x27;s portrayal of Violetta. &quot;Then [referring to the La Fenice performances] it was a fiasco; now it has created a furore. Draw your own conclusions!&quot; reported Piave (who had overseen the production in Verdi&#x27;s absence).

The opera (in the revised version) was first performed in Madrid on 1 February 1855 with Spezia-Aldighieri at Teatro Real, in Vienna on 4 May 1855 in Italian and in Barcelona on 25 October at Gran Teatre del Liceu. It was first performed in England on 24 May 1856 in Italian at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in London, where it was considered morally questionable, and &quot;the heads of the Church did their best to put an injunction upon performance; the Queen refrained from visiting the theatre during the performances, though the music, words and all, were not unheard at the palace&quot;. It was first performed in the United States by the Max Maretzek Italian Opera Company on 3 December 1856 in Italian at the Academy of Music in New York. George Templeton Strong noted in his diary: &quot;People say the plot&#x27;s immoral, but I don&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s so much worse than many others, not to speak of &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, which as put on the stage is little but rampant lechery&quot;, while the &quot;Evening Post&quot; critic wrote: &quot;Those who have quietly sat through the glaring improprieties of &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; will hardly blush or frown at anything in &quot;La traviata&quot;.&quot;

The opera was first performed in France on 6 December 1856 in Italian by the Théâtre-Italien at the Salle Ventadour in Paris, and on 27 October 1864 in French as &quot;Violetta&quot; (an adaptation by Édouard Duprez, older brother of the tenor Gilbert Duprez) at the Théâtre Lyrique on the Place du Châtelet with Christina Nilsson in the title role. The French adaptation of the libretto was published in 1865.

According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, &quot;La traviata&quot; became one of the most frequently performed operas during Verdi&#x27;s lifetime. It is often ranked highly on annual lists of most performed operas.

==Roles==

==Synopsis==

:Place: Paris and its vicinity
:Time: Beginning of the 19th century

===Act 1===
&quot;The salon in Violetta&#x27;s house&quot;

Violetta Valéry, a famed courtesan, throws a lavish party at her Paris salon to celebrate her recovery from an illness. Gastone, a viscount, has brought with him a friend, Alfredo Germont, a young bourgeois from a provincial family who has long adored Violetta from afar. While walking to the salon, Gastone tells Violetta that Alfredo loves her, and that while she was ill, he came to her house every day. Alfredo joins them, admitting the truth of Gastone&#x27;s remarks.

Baron Douphol, Violetta&#x27;s current lover, waits nearby to escort her to the salon. Once there, the Baron is asked to give a toast, but refuses, and the crowd turns to Alfredo, who agrees to sing a brindisi – a drinking song (Alfredo, Violetta, chorus: – &quot;Let&#x27;s drink from the joyful cups&quot;).

From the next room, the sound of the orchestra is heard and the guests move there to dance. After a series of severe coughs and almost fainting, Violetta begins to feel dizzy and asks her guests to go ahead and to leave her to rest until she recovers. While the guests dance in the next room, Violetta looks at her pale face in her mirror. Alfredo enters and expresses his concern for her fragile health, later declaring his love for her (Alfredo, Violetta: – &quot;One day, happy and ethereal&quot;). At first, she rejects him because his love means nothing to her, but there is something about Alfredo that touches her heart. He is about to leave when she gives him a flower, telling him to return it when it has wilted, which will be the very next day.
After the guests leave, Violetta wonders if Alfredo could actually be the one in her life (Violetta: – &quot;Ah, perhaps he is the one&quot;). But she concludes that she needs freedom to live her life (Violetta, Alfredo: – &quot;Always free&quot;). From off stage, Alfredo&#x27;s voice is heard singing about love as he walks down the street.

===Act 2===
&quot;Scene 1: Violetta&#x27;s country house outside Paris&quot;

Three months later, Alfredo and Violetta are living together in a peaceful country house outside Paris. Violetta has fallen in love with Alfredo and she has completely abandoned her former life. Alfredo sings of their happy life together (Alfredo: – &quot;The youthful ardor of my ebullient spirits&quot;). Annina, the maid, arrives from Paris, and, when questioned by Alfredo, tells him that she went there to sell the horses, carriages and everything owned by Violetta to support their country lifestyle.

Alfredo is shocked to learn this and leaves for Paris immediately to settle matters himself. Violetta returns home and receives an invitation from her friend, Flora, to a party in Paris that evening. Alfredo&#x27;s father, Giorgio Germont, is announced and demands that she break off her relationship with his son for the sake of his family, since he reveals that Violetta&#x27;s relationship with Alfredo has threatened his daughter&#x27;s engagement (Giorgio: – &quot;Pure as an angel, God gave me a daughter&quot;) because of Violetta&#x27;s reputation. Meanwhile, he reluctantly becomes impressed by Violetta&#x27;s nobility, something which he did not expect from a courtesan. She responds that she cannot end the relationship because she loves Alfredo so much, but Giorgio pleads with her for the sake of his family. With growing remorse, she finally agrees (Violetta, Giorgio: – &quot;Tell the young girl, so beautiful and pure,&quot;) and says goodbye to Giorgio. In a gesture of gratitude for her kindness and sacrifice, Giorgio kisses her forehead before leaving her weeping alone.

Violetta gives a note to Annina to send to Flora accepting the party invitation and, as she is writing a farewell letter to Alfredo, he enters. She can barely control her sadness and tears; she tells him repeatedly of her unconditional love (Violetta: – &quot;Love me, Alfredo, love me as I love you&quot;). Before rushing out and setting off for Paris, she hands the farewell letter to her servant to give to Alfredo.

Soon, the servant brings the letter to Alfredo and, as soon as he has read it, Giorgio returns and attempts to comfort his son, reminding him of his family in Provence (Giorgio: – &quot;Who erased the sea, the land of Provence from your heart?&quot;). Alfredo suspects that the Baron is behind his separation from Violetta, and the party invitation, which he finds on the desk, strengthens his suspicions. He decides to confront Violetta at the party. Giorgio tries to stop Alfredo, but he rushes out.

&quot;Scene 2: Party at Flora&#x27;s house&quot;

At the party, the Marquis tells Flora that Violetta and Alfredo have separated, much to the amazement of everyone who had previously seen the happy couple. She calls for the entertainers to perform for the guests (Chorus: – &quot;We are gypsy girls who have come from afar&quot;; – &quot;We are matadors from Madrid&quot;). Gastone and his friends join the matadors and sing (Gastone, chorus, dancers: – &quot;Piquillo is a bold and handsome matador from Biscay&quot;).

Violetta arrives with Baron Douphol. They see Alfredo at the gambling table. When he sees them, Alfredo loudly proclaims that he will take Violetta home with him. Feeling annoyed, the Baron goes to the gambling table and joins him in a game. As they bet, Alfredo wins some large sums until Flora announces that supper is ready. Alfredo leaves with handfuls of money.

As everyone is leaving the room, Violetta has asked Alfredo to see her. Fearing that the Baron&#x27;s anger will lead him to challenge Alfredo to a duel, she gently asks Alfredo to leave. Alfredo misunderstands her apprehension and demands that she admit that she loves the Baron. In grief, she makes that admission and, furiously, Alfredo calls the guests to witness what he has to say ( – &quot;You know this woman?&quot;). He humiliates and denounces Violetta in front of the guests and then throws his winnings at her feet in payment for her services. She faints onto the floor. The guests reprimand Alfredo ( - &quot;Ignoble insulter of women, go away from here, you fill us with horror!&quot;).

In search of his son, Giorgio enters the hall and, knowing the real significance of the scene, denounces his son&#x27;s behavior (Giorgio, Alfredo, Violetta, chorus: – &quot;A man, who even in anger, offends a woman renders himself deserving of contempt.&quot;).

Flora and the ladies attempt to persuade Violetta to leave the dining room, but Violetta turns to Alfredo (Violetta: – &quot;Alfredo, Alfredo, you can&#x27;t understand all the love in this heart...&quot;).

===Act 3===
&quot;Violetta&#x27;s bedroom&quot;
Dr. Grenvil tells Annina that Violetta will not live long since her tuberculosis has worsened. Alone in her room, Violetta reads a letter from Alfredo&#x27;s father telling her that the Baron was only wounded in his duel with Alfredo. He has informed Alfredo of the sacrifice she has made for him and his sister; and he is sending his son to see her as quickly as possible to ask for her forgiveness. But Violetta senses it is too late (Violetta: – &quot;Farewell, lovely, happy dreams of the past&quot;).

Annina rushes into the room to tell Violetta of Alfredo&#x27;s arrival. The lovers are reunited and Alfredo suggests that they leave Paris (Alfredo, Violetta: – &quot;We will leave Paris, O beloved&quot;).

But it is too late: she knows her death approaches (Alfredo, Violetta: – &quot;Great God!...to die so young&quot;). Alfredo&#x27;s father enters with the doctor, regretting what he has done. After singing a duet with Alfredo, Violetta suddenly revives, exclaiming that the pain and discomfort have left her. A moment later, she dies in Alfredo&#x27;s arms.

==Instrumentation==

The opera uses an orchestra with the following instrumentation: 2 flutes (fl. 2 doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, harp, cimbasso, timpani, cymbals, bass drum, triangle, strings.

Banda: Verdi did not fully orchestrate the parts of the on-stage band, but rather composed it in the style of a piano reduction, leaving the actual realization to the person in charge of the band. Over the years many versions were created, varying from theater to theater depending on the instruments available, but none of them is authoritative. A widespread version is: 1 piccolo, 4 clarinets, 2 horns, flugelhorn, 3 trumpets, at least 2 trombones, low brasses (number unspecified), bass drum.

==Music==

The prelude to the opera begins with very soft, very high strings depicting the frail heroine, followed by the main love theme of the opera, which is then played on lower strings while the higher instruments decorate the melody.

This delicate atmosphere is altered on curtain rise by lively dance tunes in the orchestra. After the famous &quot;Brindisi&quot;, an offstage band plays a series of waltzes (waltz rhythms pervade the first act of the opera, creating a Parisian atmosphere). The concluding part of Violetta&#x27;s solo scene that ends the first act is full of vocal decoration and feverish ornamentation as she swears to stay free (&quot;Sempre libera&quot;). These coloratura effects are not required for the character after the first act.

The lengthy and crucial duet between the elder Germont and Violetta in act 2 is multi-sectioned with the music following the changing dramatic situation.

&quot;La traviata&quot; is the only one of Verdi&#x27;s many operas to be set entirely indoors. Unlike &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, which was composed simultaneously, &quot;La traviata&quot; is an intimate piece, full of tender lyricism. The character of Violetta dominates the work and her music changes as she develops through the drama, from the hectic, almost hysterical coloratura of the first act, to the more dramatic passages of the second, and the spiritual quality of her music as she dies in act 3.

<text>Il trovatore (&#x27;The Troubadour&#x27;) is an opera in four acts by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto largely written by Salvadore Cammarano, based on the Spanish play &quot;El trovador&quot; (1836) by Antonio García Gutiérrez. It was García Gutiérrez&#x27;s most successful play, one which Verdi scholar Julian Budden describes as &quot;a high flown, sprawling melodrama flamboyantly defiant of the Aristotelian unities, packed with all manner of fantastic and bizarre incident.&quot;

The premiere took place at the Teatro Apollo in Rome on 19 January 1853, where it &quot;began a victorious march throughout the operatic world&quot;, a success due to Verdi&#x27;s work over the previous three years. It began with his January 1850 approach to Cammarano with the idea of &quot;Il trovatore&quot;. There followed, slowly and with interruptions, the preparation of the libretto, first by Cammarano until his death in mid-1852 and then with the young librettist Leone Emanuele Bardare, which gave the composer the opportunity to propose significant revisions, which were accomplished under his direction. These revisions are seen largely in the expansion of the role of Leonora.

For Verdi, the three years were filled with musical activity; work on this opera did not proceed while the composer wrote and premiered &quot;Rigoletto&quot; in Venice in March 1851. His personal affairs also limited his professional work. In May 1851, an additional commission was offered by the Venice company after &quot;Rigoletto&quot;&#x27;s success there. Another commission came from Paris while he was visiting that city from late 1851 to March 1852. Before the libretto for &quot;Il trovatore&quot; was completed, before it was scored, and before it premiered, Verdi had four operatic projects in various stages of development.

Today, &quot;Il trovatore&quot; is performed frequently and is a staple of the standard operatic repertoire.

==Composition history==

How and when Verdi acquired a copy of the García Gutiérrez play is uncertain, but Budden notes that it appears that Giuseppina Strepponi, with whom Verdi had been living in Busseto since September 1849, had translated the play, as evidenced in a letter from her two weeks before the premiere urging him to &quot;hurry up and give OUR &quot;Trovatore&quot;&quot;.

When considering setting García Gutiérrez&#x27;s play, Verdi turned to work with Cammarano, &quot;the born operatic poet&quot; (according to Budden). Their correspondence began as early as January 1850, well before Verdi had done anything to develop a libretto with Piave for what later became &quot;Rigoletto&quot; in Venice. At this time, it was also the first since &quot;Oberto&quot; that the composer was beginning to prepare an opera with a librettist but without a commission of any kind from an opera house. In his first letter to Cammarano, Verdi proposed &quot;El Trovador&quot; as the subject with &quot;two feminine roles. The first, the gypsy, a woman of unusual character after whom I want to name the opera.&quot;

With regard to the chosen librettist&#x27;s strength as a poet in preparing verse for opera, Budden also comments that his approach was very traditional, something which began to become clear during the preparation of the libretto and which appears in the correspondence between the two men.

===Relationship with Cammarano===

Verdi&#x27;s time and energy were spent mostly on finishing &quot;Rigoletto,&quot; which premiered at La Fenice in Venice in March 1851. Within a matter of weeks, Verdi was expressing his frustration to a mutual friend, Cesare De Sanctis, at having no communication from Cammarano. His letter emphasized that &quot;the bolder he is, the happier it will make me,&quot; although it appears that Cammarano&#x27;s reply contained several objections, which Verdi answered on 4 April and, in his response, he emphasized certain aspects of the plot which were important to him. These included Leonora taking the veil and also the importance of the Azucena/Manrico relationship. He continued by asking whether the librettist liked the drama and emphasized that &quot;the more unusual and bizarre the better&quot;.

Verdi also writes that if there were no standard forms – &quot;cavatinas, duets, trios, choruses, finales, etc. [...] and if you could avoid beginning with an opening chorus...&quot; he would be quite happy. Correspondence continued between the two men for the following two months or so, including another letter from the composer of 9 April which included three pages of suggestions. But he also made concessions and expresses his happiness in what he is receiving in the way of verse.

During the period to follow, in spite of his preoccupations but especially after he had begun to overcome them, Verdi had kept in touch with the librettist. In a letter around the time of his intended departure for France, he wrote encouragingly to Cammarano: &quot;I beg you with all my soul to finish this &quot;Trovatore&quot; as quickly as you possibly can.&quot;

===Preoccupations and delays in 1851–1852===

There then arose the question of where the opera would eventually be presented. Verdi had turned down an offer from Naples, but became concerned about the availability of his preferred Azucena, Rita Gabussi-De Bassini. She turned out not to be on the Naples roster, but expressed an interest in the possibility of Rome.

Things were put on hold for several months as Verdi became preoccupied with family matters, which included the illnesses of both his mother (who died in July) and father, the estrangement from his parents with communications conducted only between lawyers, and the administration of his newly acquired property at Sant&#x27;Agata (now the Villa Verdi near his hometown of Busseto), where he had established his parents. But his relationship with his parents, albeit legally severed, as well as Strepponi&#x27;s situation living with the composer in an unmarried state, continued to preoccupy him, as did the deterioration of his relationship with his father-in-law, Antonio Barezzi. Finally, in April 1851, agreement was reached with the elder Verdis on the payment of debts mutually owed and the couple were given time to resettle, leaving Sant&#x27;Agata for Verdi and Strepponi to occupy for the next fifty years.

May 1851 brought an offer for a new opera from the Venice authorities, and it was followed by an agreement with the Rome Opera company to present &quot;Trovatore&quot; during the 1852/1853 Carnival season, specifically in January 1853.

By November Verdi and Strepponi left Italy to spend the winter of 1851/52 in Paris, where he concluded an agreement with the Paris Opéra to write what became &quot;Les vêpres siciliennes&quot;, his first grand opera, although he had adapted his earlier &quot;I Lombardi&quot; into &quot;Jérusalem&quot; for the stage. Including work on &quot;Trovatore&quot;, other projects consumed him, but a significant event occurred in February, when the couple attended a performance of &quot;The Lady of the Camellias&quot; by Alexandre Dumas &quot;fils&quot;. What followed is reported by Verdi&#x27;s biographer Mary Jane Phillips-Matz who states that the composer revealed that, after seeing the play, he immediately began to compose music for what would later become &quot;La traviata&quot;.

The couple returned to Sant&#x27;Agata by mid-March 1852 and Verdi immediately began work on &quot;Trovatore&quot; after a year&#x27;s delay.

===Death of Cammarano and work with Bardare===
Then, in July 1852, by way of an announcement in a theatrical journal, Verdi received news of Cammarano&#x27;s death earlier that month. This was both a professional and a personal blow. The composer learned that Cammarano had completed Manrico&#x27;s third-act aria, &quot;Di quella pira&quot; just eight days before his death, but now he turned to De Sanctis to find him another librettist. Leone Emanuele Bardare was a young poet from Naples who was beginning his career; eventually he wrote more than 15 librettos before 1880. Composer and librettist met in Rome around 20 December 1852 and Verdi began work on both &quot;Trovatore&quot; and &quot;La traviata&quot;.

His main aim, having changed his mind about the distribution of characters in the opera, was to enhance the role of Leonora, thus making it &quot;a two-women opera&quot; and he communicated many of these ideas ahead of time via letters to De Sanctis over several months. Leonora now was to have a cantabile for the Miserere as well as retaining &quot;Tacea la Notte&quot; in act 1 with its cabaletta. Changes were also made to Azucena&#x27;s &quot;Stride la vampa&quot; and to the Count&#x27;s lines. Taking into account the last-minute requirements of the censor and the consequent changes, overall, the revisions and changes enhanced the opera, and the result was that it was a critical and a popular success.

==Performance history==
In Italian as &quot;Il trovatore&quot; 


The opera&#x27;s immense popularity – albeit a popular success rather than a critical one – came from some 229 productions worldwide in the three years following its premiere on 19 January 1853, and is illustrated by the fact that &quot;in Naples, for example, where the opera in its first three years had eleven stagings in six theaters, the performances totalled 190&quot;.

First given in Paris in Italian on 23 December 1854 by the Théâtre-Italien at the Salle Ventadour, the cast included Lodovico Graziani as Manrico and Adelaide Borghi-Mamo as Azucena.

&quot;Il trovatore&quot; was first performed in the US by the Max Maretzek Italian Opera Company on 2 May 1855 at the then-recently opened Academy of Music in New York. The cast included Balbina Steffenone as Leonora, Pasquale Brignoli as Manrico, Felicita Vestvali as Azucena, and Alessandro Amodio as the Count di Luna. The work&#x27;s UK premiere took place on 10 May 1855 at Covent Garden in London, with Jenny Bürde-Ney as Leonora, Enrico Tamberlik as Manrico, Pauline Viardot as Azucena and Francesco Graziani as the Conte di Luna.

As the 19th century proceeded there was a decline in interest, but &quot;Il trovatore&quot; saw a revival of interest after Toscanini&#x27;s 1902 revivals. From its performance at the Met on 26 October 1883 the opera has been a staple of its repertoire.

Today, almost all performances use the Italian version and it is one of the world&#x27;s most frequently performed operas.

In French as &quot;Le trouvère&quot; 

After the successful presentation of the opera in Italian in Paris, François-Louis Crosnier, director of l&#x27;Opéra de Paris, proposed that Verdi revise his opera for the Paris audience as a grand opera, which would include a ballet, to be presented on the stage of the major Paris house. While Verdi was in Paris with Giuseppina Strepponi from late July 1855, working on the completion of &quot;Aroldo&quot; and beginning to prepare a libretto with Piave for what would become &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot;, he encountered some legal difficulties in dealing with Toribio Calzado, the impresario of the Théâtre des Italiens, and, with his contacts with the Opėra, agreed to prepare a French version of &quot;Trovatore&quot; on 22 September 1855.

A translation of Cammarano&#x27;s libretto was made by librettist Émilien Pacini under the title of &quot;Le trouvère&quot; and it was first performed at La Monnaie in Brussels on 20 May 1856. There followed the production at the Paris Opera&#x27;s Salle Le Peletier on 12 January 1857 after which Verdi returned to Italy. Emperor Napoleon III and Empress Eugénie attended the latter performance.

For the French premiere, Verdi made some changes to the score of &quot;Le trouvère&quot; including the addition of music for the ballet in act 3 which followed the soldiers&#x27; chorus, where gypsies danced to entertain them. The quality of Verdi&#x27;s ballet music has been noted by scholar Charles Osborne: &quot;He could have been the Tchaikovsky of Italian ballet&quot; he states, continuing to praise it as &quot;perfect ballet music&quot;. In addition, he describes the unusual practice of Verdi having woven in themes from the gypsy chorus of act 2, ballet music for opera rarely connecting with the themes of the work. Several other revisions focused on Azucena&#x27;s music, including an extended version of the finale of act 4, to accommodate the role&#x27;s singer Adelaide Borghi-Mamo. Some of these changes have even been used in modern performances in Italian.

In 1990 Tulsa Opera presented the first staging of &quot;Le trouvère&quot; in the United States using a new critical edition by musicologist, conductor, and Verdi scholar David Lawton. Recorded live for broadcast on NPR, Lawton conducted the premiere with Margaret Jane Wray as Leonore, Craig Sirianni as Manrique, Greer Grimsley as Le Comte de Luna, Barbara Conrad as Azucena, and the Tulsa Philharmonic. This version was published by Ricordi and the University of Chicago Press in 2001. An updated version of this critical edition by Lawton was published by Ricordi in 2018, and given its premiere at the Festival Verdi in Parma that same year.

Rarely given in French, it was presented as part of the 1998 Festival della Valle d&#x27;Itria and in 2002 &quot;Le trouvère&quot; appeared as part of the Sarasota Opera&#x27;s &quot;Verdi Cycle&quot; of all the composer&#x27;s work.

&quot;Scene 1: The guard room in the castle of Luna (The Palace of Aljafería, Zaragoza, Spain)&quot;

Ferrando, the captain of the guards, orders his men to keep watch while Count di Luna wanders restlessly beneath the windows of Leonora, lady-in-waiting to the Princess. Di Luna loves Leonora and is jealous of his successful rival, a troubadour whose identity he does not know. In order to keep the guards awake, Ferrando narrates the history of the count (Racconto: / &quot;The good Count di Luna lived happily, the father of two sons&quot;): many years ago, a gypsy woman was wrongfully accused of having bewitched the youngest of the di Luna children; the child had fallen sick, and for this the gypsy had been burnt alive as a witch, her protests of innocence ignored. Dying, she had commanded her daughter Azucena to avenge her, which she did by abducting the baby. Although the burnt bones of a child were found in the ashes of the pyre, the father refused to believe his son&#x27;s death. Dying, the father commanded his firstborn, the new Count di Luna, to seek Azucena.

&quot;Scene 2: Garden in the palace of the princess&quot;

Leonora confesses her love for the Troubadour to her confidante, Ines (Cavatina (&quot;Tacea la notte placida&quot; / &quot;The peaceful night lay silent&quot;... &quot;Di tale amor&quot; / &quot;A love that words can scarcely describe&quot;), in which she tells how she fell in love with a mystery knight, victor at a tournament; lost track of him when a civil war broke out; then encountered him again, in disguise as a wandering troubadour who sang beneath her window. When they have gone, Count di Luna enters, intending to pay court to Leonora himself, but hears the voice of his rival in the distance: (&quot;Deserto sulla terra&quot; / &quot;Alone upon this earth&quot;). Leonora in the darkness briefly mistakes the count for her lover, until the Troubadour himself enters the garden, and she rushes to his arms. The Count challenges his rival to reveal his true identity, which he does: Manrico, a knight now outlawed and under death sentence for his allegiance to a rival prince. Manrico in turn challenges him to call the guards, but the Count regards this encounter as a personal rather than political matter, and challenges Manrico instead to a duel over their common love. Leonora tries to intervene, but cannot stop them from fighting (Trio: &quot;Di geloso amor sprezzato&quot; / &quot;The fire of jealous love&quot; ).

===Act 2: The Gypsy Woman===
&quot;Scene 1: The gypsies&#x27; camp&quot;

The gypsies sing the &quot;Anvil Chorus&quot;: &quot;Vedi le fosche notturne&quot; / &quot;See! The endless sky casts off her sombre nightly garb...&quot;. Azucena, the daughter of the Gypsy woman burnt by the count, is still haunted by her duty to avenge her mother (Canzone: &quot;Stride la vampa&quot; / &quot;The flames are roaring!&quot;). The Gypsies break camp while Azucena confesses to Manrico that after stealing the di Luna baby she had intended to burn the count&#x27;s little son along with her mother, but overwhelmed by the screams and the gruesome scene of her mother&#x27;s execution, she became confused and threw her own child into the flames instead (Racconto: &quot;Condotta ell&#x27;era in ceppi&quot; / &quot;They dragged her in bonds&quot;).

Manrico realises that he is not the son of Azucena, but loves her as if she were indeed his mother, as she has always been faithful and loving to him – and, indeed, saved his life only recently, discovering him left for dead on a battlefield after being caught in ambush. Manrico tells Azucena that he defeated di Luna in their earlier duel, but was held back from killing him by a mysterious power (Duet: &quot;Mal reggendo&quot; / &quot;He was helpless under my savage attack&quot;): and Azucena reproaches him for having stayed his hand then, especially since it was the Count&#x27;s forces that defeated him in the subsequent battle of Pelilla. A messenger arrives and reports that Manrico&#x27;s allies have taken Castle Castellor, which Manrico is ordered to hold in the name of his prince: and also that Leonora, who believes Manrico dead, is about to enter a convent and take the veil that night. Although Azucena tries to prevent him from leaving in his weak state (&quot;Ferma! Son io che parlo a te!&quot; / &quot;I must talk to you&quot;), Manrico rushes away to prevent her from carrying out this intent.

&quot;Scene 2: In front of the convent&quot;

Di Luna and his attendants intend to abduct Leonora and the Count sings of his love for her (Aria: &quot;Il balen del suo sorriso&quot; / &quot;The light of her smile&quot; ... &quot;Per me ora fatale&quot; / &quot;Fatal hour of my life&quot;). Leonora and the nuns appear in procession, but Manrico prevents di Luna from carrying out his plans and takes Leonora away with him, although once again leaving the Count behind unharmed, as the soldiers on both sides back down from bloodshed, the Count being held back by his own men.

===Act 3: The Son of the Gypsy Woman===
&quot;Scene 1: Di Luna&#x27;s camp&quot;

Di Luna and his army are attacking the fortress Castellor where Manrico has taken refuge with Leonora (Chorus: &quot;Or co&#x27; dadi ma fra poco&quot; / &quot;Now we play at dice&quot;). Ferrando drags in Azucena, who has been captured wandering near the camp. When she hears di Luna&#x27;s name, Azucena&#x27;s reactions arouse suspicion and Ferrando recognizes her as the supposed murderer of the count&#x27;s brother. Azucena cries out to her son Manrico to rescue her and the count realizes that he has the means to flush his enemy out of the fortress. He orders his men to build a pyre and burn Azucena before the walls.

&quot;Scene 2: A chamber in the castle&quot;

Inside the castle, Manrico and Leonora are preparing to be married. She is frightened; the battle with di Luna is imminent and Manrico&#x27;s forces are outnumbered. He assures her of his love (Aria: &quot;Ah sì, ben mio, coll&#x27;essere&quot; / &quot;Ah, yes, my love, in being yours&quot;), even in the face of death. When news of Azucena&#x27;s capture reaches him, he summons his men and desperately prepares to attack (Cabaletta: &quot;Di quella pira l&#x27;orrendo foco&quot; / &quot;The horrid flames of that pyre&quot;). Leonora faints.

===Act 4: The Punishment===
&quot;Scene 1: Before the dungeon keep&quot;

Manrico has failed to free Azucena and has been imprisoned himself. Leonora attempts to free him (Aria: &quot;D&#x27;amor sull&#x27;ali rosee&quot; / &quot;On the rosy wings of love&quot;; Chorus &amp; Duet: &quot;Miserere&quot; / &quot;Lord, thy mercy on this soul&quot;) by begging di Luna for mercy and offers herself in place of her lover. She promises to give herself to the Count, but secretly swallows poison from her ring in order to die before di Luna can possess her (Duet: &quot;Mira, d&#x27;acerbe lagrime&quot; / &quot;See the bitter tears I shed&quot;).

&quot;Scene 2: In the dungeon&quot;

Manrico and Azucena are awaiting their execution. Manrico attempts to soothe Azucena, whose mind wanders to happier days in the mountains (Duet: &quot;Ai nostri monti ritorneremo&quot; / &quot;Again to our mountains we shall return&quot;). At last the gypsy slumbers. Leonora comes to Manrico and tells him that he is saved, begging him to escape. When he discovers she cannot accompany him, he refuses to leave his prison. He believes Leonora has betrayed him until he realizes that she has taken poison to remain true to him. As she dies in agony in Manrico&#x27;s arms, she confesses that she prefers to die with him than to marry another (Trio: &quot;Prima che d&#x27;altri vivere&quot; / &quot;Rather than live as another&#x27;s&quot;). The Count hears Leonora&#x27;s last words and orders Manrico&#x27;s execution. Azucena awakens and tries to stop di Luna. Once she finds out Manrico is dead, she cries: &quot;Egli era tuo fratello! Sei vendicata, o madre.&quot; / &quot;He was your brother ... You are avenged, oh mother!&quot;

==Music==

Today, most opera scholars recognize the expressive musical qualities of Verdi&#x27;s writing. However, musicologist Roger Parker notes that &quot;the extreme formalism of the musical language has been seen as serving to concentrate and define the various stages of the drama, above all channeling them into those key confrontations that mark its inexorable progress&quot;.

Here he, like many other writers, notes the elements of musical form (then often described as &quot;closed forms&quot;) which characterize the opera and make it appear to be something of a return to the language of earlier times, &quot;the veritable apotheosis of &quot;bel canto&quot; with its demands for vocal beauty, agility and range,&quot; notes Charles Osborne. Thus, the cantabile-cabaletta two-part arias, the use of the chorus, etc., which Verdi had originally asked Cammarano to ignore, are evident. But Verdi wanted something else: &quot;the freer the forms he presents me with, the better I shall do,&quot; he wrote to the librettist&#x27;s friend in March 1851. It was not what he received from his librettist, but he certainly demonstrated his total mastery over this style. Osborne&#x27;s take on &quot;&#x27;Il trovatore&quot; is that &quot;it is as though Verdi had decided to do something which he had been perfecting over the years, and to do it so beautifully that he need never to do it again. Formally, it is a step backward after &quot;Rigoletto&quot;&quot;.

Budden describes one of the musical qualities as the relationship between the &quot;consistent dramatic impetus&quot; of the action being caused by the &quot;propulsive quality&quot; of the music which produces a &quot;sense of continuous forward motion&quot;. Parker describes it as &quot;sheer musical energy apparent in all the numbers&quot;. And Budden gives many examples which show Verdi as &quot;the equal of Bellini&quot; as a melodist.

Verdi also clearly recognizes the importance of the role of Azucena. Remembering that the composer&#x27;s initial suggestion to Cammarano was that he wanted to name the opera after her, Budden notes that this character &quot;is the first of a glorious line&quot; and he names Ulrica (from &quot;Ballo&quot;), Eboli (from &quot;Don Carlos&quot;), and Amneris (from &quot;Aida&quot;) as followers in the same vocal range and with the same expressive and distinct qualities which separate them from the other female role in the opera in which they feature. He quotes from a letter which Verdi wrote to Marianna Barbieri-Nini, the soprano who was due to sing the Leonora in Venice after the premiere, and who expressed reservations about her music. Here, Verdi emphasizes the importance of the role of Azucena:
:..it&#x27;s a principal, &quot;the&quot; principal role; finer and more dramatic and more original than the other. If I were a prima donna (a fine thing that would be!), I would always rather sing the part of the Gypsy in &quot;Il trovatore&quot;.

From this position, Budden comments on the distinct differences in an era where vocal registers were less defined and which extend into Leonora&#x27;s and Azucena&#x27;s music &quot;where greater verbal projection of the lower voice [can be] turned to advantage&quot; and where &quot;the polarity between the two female roles [extends] into every field of comparison.&quot; He then sums up the musical relationship which exists between the two female characters, the men having simply been defined as being representative of their own voice types, something evident and very striking in Verdi&#x27;s significant use of voice types in &quot;Ernani&quot; of 1844. Regarding Leonora, Budden describes her music as &quot;mov[ing] in long phrases most characterized by a soaring &#x27;aspiring&#x27; quality&quot; whereas &quot;Azucena&#x27;s melodies evolve in short, often commonplace phrases based on the repetition of short rhythmic patterns&quot;.

==Cultural references==
Enrico Caruso once said that all it takes for a successful performance of &quot;Il trovatore&quot; is the four greatest singers in the world. On many occasions, this opera and its music have been featured in various forms of popular culture and entertainment. Scenes of comic chaos play out over a performance of &quot;Il trovatore&quot; in the Marx Brothers film &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; (including a quotation, in the middle of the act 1 overture, of &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot;). Luchino Visconti used a performance of &quot;Il trovatore&quot; at La Fenice opera house for the opening sequence of his 1954 film &quot;Senso&quot;. As Manrico sings his battle cry in &quot;Di quella pira&quot;, the performance is interrupted by the answering cries of Italian nationalists on the upper balcony who shower the stalls area below with patriotic leaflets. In &quot;Italian Film in the Light of Neorealism&quot;, Millicent Marcus proposes that Visconti used this operatic paradigm throughout &quot;Senso&quot;, with parallels between the opera&#x27;s protagonists, Manrico and Leonora, and the film&#x27;s protagonists, Ussoni and Livia. A staging of act 1, scene 2, of &quot;Il trovatore&quot; is featured in Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s 1979 film &quot;La Luna&quot;. Music from the opera was featured on Kijiji in Canada for commercials.

==Historical references==

While the story and most of the characters are fictitious, it is set towards the end of a real civil war in Aragon. Following the death of King Martin of Aragon in 1410, no fewer than six candidates staked a claim for the throne. A political meeting, the Compromise of Caspe, found in favour of Martin&#x27;s sororal nephew Ferdinand. Count James II of Urgell, King Martin&#x27;s brother-in-law and the closest relative through purely patrilineal line of descent, refused to accept the decision of the Compromise, believing (with some justification) that Martin had intended to adopt him as the heir by appointing him Governor-General after the death of his own son Martin the Younger, and rebelled. A third candidate was Frederic, Count of Luna, bastard son of Martin the Younger, whose legitimization had been sought from the Pope unsuccessfully. As part of the compromise for withdrawing his own claim in favour of Ferdinand, Frederic was granted the County of Luna, one of the lesser titles that his father had held.

While neither of the two princes who actually took part in the war appears in the operaneither is even referred to by name, and only Urgell is referred to by his titlethe fortunes of their followers mirror those of their princes. Thus, with his military success, Ferdinand&#x27;s side has the upper hand in the war and is effectively the Royalist party, with the backing of much of the nobility and the Dowager Queen, and he also has Di Luna as his chief henchman (Luna&#x27;s own connection to the royal family is not mentioned, being not necessary to the drama): while Urgel, losing the war and on the back foot, is forced to recruit among outlaws and the dispossessed, effectively taking the part of a rebel despite having some legal right to his case. Thus the fact that the forces of Urgel, in the opera as in real life, lose every pitched battle: and on the single occasion that they capture a castle (named in the opera as &quot;Castellor&quot;, a fairly generic name for a castle, there being many Castellars in the region), it proves a handicap to them because their only hope in battle lies in speed, mobility, surprise and ambush, all of which are lost when defending a fortress.

Thus it is that the fictitious troubadour Manrico can gain his rags-to-riches background, having risen from the obscurity of a Biscayan gypsy camp to become Urgel&#x27;s chief general, a knight and a master swordsman in his own right, good enough to defeat Di Luna himself in a personal duel, or win a knightly tournament: only to lose it again on the military battlefield, where the odds are perpetually against him, and he is damned as an outlaw even before the opera begins, for no deed of his own but because his master is the rebel. And yet he gets to be a heroic, popular outlaw, who might just escape with his life in return for a vow of future loyalty, if put on trial in front of the Prince himself: a chance that Luna does not want to risk, given that his rivalry with Manrico is personal as well as political. Hence the challenge to the duel over the personal rivalry, instead of calling the guards and making the arrest political, in act 1: and hence also the decision to execute without trial in act 4 even though Luna knows he is abusing his position. Leonora and Azucena are, of course, as fictitious as Manrico, as is the story&#x27;s conceit that the former Count of Luna had not one but two sons.

==Recordings==
Over the last century there has been an increase in interest and appreciation for Verdi&#x27;s music. Remarkably, there has been a lot of interest in the excerpt &quot;Miserere&quot; and &quot;Di Quella Pira&quot;, and since the dawn of recorded music there have been tens of recordings of these fragments, ranging from vocal interpretations to instrumental duets. For the early American market, Giannini&#x27;s and Pryor&#x27;s arrangements may be notable, and for the Russian market Labinskii&#x27;s recording is considered to be the most mature. Though, for the first half of the 20th century, Caruso&#x27;s version would be the most acclaimed.

== In popular culture ==

The Anvil Chorus is one of the most-recognized pieces of classical music. It &quot;has transcended the opera itself&quot; and is often played in non-opera concerts. It appears in many cultural references as well.
A modified sample of an 1899 recording of Ferruccio Giannini&#x27;s performance of &quot;Miserere&quot; appears on The Caretaker recording &quot;Everywhere at the End of Time (Stage 3).&quot;

<doc id="37907" wikidata="Q211279" url="?curid=37907" title="Ernani">
<text>Ernani is an operatic &quot;dramma lirico&quot; in four acts by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto by Francesco Maria Piave, based on the 1830 play &quot;Hernani&quot; by Victor Hugo.

Verdi was commissioned by the Teatro La Fenice in Venice to write an opera, but finding the right subject took some time, and the composer worked with the inexperienced Piave in shaping first one and then another drama by Hugo into an acceptable libretto. As musicologist Roger Parker notes, the composer &quot;intervened on several important points, insisting for example that the role of Ernani be sung by a tenor (rather than by a contralto as had originally been planned)&quot;.

&quot;Ernani&quot; was first performed on 9 March 1844, and it was &quot;immensely popular, and was revived countless times during its early years&quot;.

It became Verdi&#x27;s most popular opera until it was superseded by &quot;Il trovatore&quot; after 1853. In 1903, it became the first opera to be recorded completely.

==Composition history==
Following the success of both &quot;Nabucco&quot; and &quot;I Lombardi&quot;, Verdi was approached by many opera companies wanting to commission him to write an opera for their houses. Rather than prepare another for La Scala, he was interested in a commission for two operas for the 1843–44 season (one of which would be &quot;I Lombardi&quot;) which came from the President of the Teatro la Fenice in Venice, Marquis Nanni Mocenigo.

However, the composer was only willing to accept the terms which he proposed: 12,000 Austrian lire to be paid after the first performance, not the third as proposed by Venice (Verdi recalled what had happened to &quot;Un giorno di regno&quot; with its one and only performance). Amongst other stipulations, he demanded the right to choose his own subject and his own librettist, and also to pay him directly, as well as refusing to accept the requirement that a full orchestral score be available in advance. In addition, he had the right to choose the singers from the assembled company for that season. David Kimbell notes one additional demand:

He explains [to Mocenigo at La Fenice]—and this was rare at the time—that he began to compose only when the libretto was completed to his satisfaction because &quot;when I have a general conception of the whole poem, the music comes of its own accord&quot;

Once this agreement was settled upon, the next step was to choose a subject, something which took some time. Several subjects came to Verdi&#x27;s attention: for example, Byron&#x27;s &quot;The Corsair&quot; was considered, but the right baritone was not available. In thinking about an opera about the Venetian Foscari family, he found that it was forbidden by the censor in order to avoid upsetting any of the descendants of that family who were then living in Venice. (Both of these subjects were to become later Verdi operas, &quot;Il corsaro&quot; and &quot;I due Foscari&quot;, the latter opening in Rome later in 1844.)

An unsolicited manuscript from the unknown Francesco Piave (who was La Fenice&#x27;s resident poet and stage manager in addition to being a friend of Brenna, the company&#x27;s Secretary) proposed an opera, &quot;Cromwell,&quot; based on Victor Hugo&#x27;s play, and on which he had started work. Mocenigo assured the composer of Piave&#x27;s sense of the theatre and of musical forms, and so they agreed to proceed, although by the time of its approval by the Fenice authorities, it had become &quot;Allan Cameron&quot;, a story set in the time just prior to the accession of Britain&#x27;s Charles II. Immediately, Verdi took control and made it clear to Piave what he wanted in the way of a theatrical experience: &quot;...Let&#x27;s have as few words as possible ... Remember that brevity is never a fault ... But I do insist on brevity because that&#x27;s what the public wants...&quot;

=== The idea for &quot;Hernani&quot; ===
The &quot;Cromwell&quot; libretto arrived from Piave in pieces, and Verdi put it away until he had the complete version to work from. However, when the composer and La Fenice&#x27;s president met in Venice in late August, Verdi expressed some dissatisfaction at how the libretto had turned out. Then Mocenigo&#x27;s casual reference to Hugo&#x27;s successful 1830 drama &quot;Hernani&quot; as an idea for a libretto caught Verdi&#x27;s imagination, as seen in a letter which the latter wrote to Mocenigo in early September which expressed concerns about &quot;Allan Cameron&quot; and the way it had turned out, though noting that this was &quot;the fault of the subject and not the poet&quot;. He continues:

But oh, if only we could do &quot;Hernani&quot; instead that would be tremendous. I know that it would mean a great deal of trouble for the poet but my first task would be to try and compensate him... all he would have to do would be to condense and tighten up; the action is already there ready made, and it&#x27;s all immensely good theatre. Tomorrow I&#x27;ll write at length to Piave setting out all the scenes from &quot;Hernani&quot; which seem to me suitable.

At this point he continues with suggestions for the poet. For Verdi, the appeal of Hugo&#x27;s work – which the latter described as &quot;Romanticism or the Liberalism in literature&quot; – was &quot;the struggle between love and honour&quot;, and Budden sums up this appeal as &quot;Within Hugo&#x27;s scheme each illogical action follows logically from the one that precedes it, giving Verdi the pace, the eventfulness and above all the dramatic unity that he has been looking for.&quot;

=== Setting the play as the opera, &quot;Ernani&quot; ===
However, Piave was not at all pleased by this turn of events and felt that an opera based on &quot;Hernani&quot; could not be staged because of censorship. For instance, the King&#x27;s first appearance in the play is from a cupboard where he has been hiding since some time after his arrival and before he meets Elvira. Thus he overhears much of the interaction between Elvira and Ernani before finally revealing himself. Verdi must have realized that no king &quot;would ever be allowed to hide in a cupboard&quot;, according to Budden.

But the La Fenice directorate did approve the concept and the librettist was offered compensation, although he saved his &quot;Allan Cameron&quot; in reserve in case of mishap. As it evolved, the opera – originally titled &quot;Don Ruy Gomez de Silva&quot; in synopsis form – came more and more &quot;to reflect the unique character of the parent drama&quot; as Verdi wished to stick as closely as possible to the original play. For Budden, this &quot;marks a new outlook in Italian opera&quot;, because this would never have occurred to either Rossini or Donizetti, for whom plots were interchangeable.

Although Verdi had agreed to try to accommodate the contralto Carolina Vietti when the opera was &quot;Allan Cameron&quot;, he was against making the leading character of Ernani a musico contralto. However, he compromised somewhat and, by the end of October, it appeared that the four voice types were to be soprano (Elvira), contralto (Ernani), tenor (Don Carlo), and baritone (de Silva), but after the acceptance of the libretto by the Venetian police, Verdi was able to hold firm and ultimately get what he wanted: a soprano, a tenor, a baritone, and – although Rosi was not an experienced enough singer – a bass in the role of de Silva. Thus it became a comprimario role, one to be sung by a second-rung singer in the company. But, as Budden notes, Verdi&#x27;s &quot;difficulties with singers were not yet over&quot;.

The season opened with &quot;I Lombardi&quot; in December 1843. It was a disaster, with terrible singing from the tenor Domenico Conti. Two other operas early in the 1843/44 season were equally poorly received. Having heard one other potential tenor, Vitali, as a possible replacement, the composer presented an ultimatum: either be released from his contract or the company would engage Carlo Guasco in the role of Ernani. With a premiere set for March, two final glitches were overcome: the bass Rosi had disappeared from consideration as de Silva but was replaced by Meini, who then withdrew because he found the part too low. Verdi then engaged a member of the chorus, the bass Antonio Selva who went on to a distinguished career. And, in spite of complaints from the soprano, Sophie Löwe, that she was not to be front and centre for the finale, she became part of the final trio.

==Verdi and theatre==

Budden notes the following in regard to the specific relationship between this opera and the work of Victor Hugo:

...from the first the spirit of Hugo is there. Verdi [ten years younger than the playwright] was part of that youthful audience to which the play &quot;Hernani&quot; is addressed. The bounding energy of Hugo&#x27;s alexandrines is reflected in the spirit of Verdi&#x27;s music, which is far more forceful than anything he had written so far. Victor Hugo, one might say, was good for Verdi; and it significant that both the operas that he based on Hugo&#x27;s plays (the other was of course &quot;Rigoletto&quot;) were landmarks in his career.

But it is the composer himself who, in a letter to Brenna, the La Fenice secretary and a friend of Piave&#x27;s, sums up his own sense of theatre, of what works and what does not. This was written at a time when Piave was unhappy about the shift from his original libretto to the one for what became &quot;Ernani&quot;. With this shift came many changes of direction as issues such as casting came into consideration, and Verdi asks Brenna to communicate his feelings to the librettist:

However little experience I may have had, I do go to the theatre [Verdi is referring to the opera house] all the year round and I pay the most careful attention to what I see and hear. I&#x27;ve been able to put my finger on so many works which wouldn&#x27;t have failed if the pieces had been better laid out, the effects better calculated, the musical forms clearer, etc... in a word, if either the composer or the poet had been more experienced.

In effect, Verdi is taking control over all aspects of the piece, which includes the condensation of the sprawling play into his four acts. (The first two acts of Hugo&#x27;s play become act 1 of the opera). Rather than allow the librettist a free hand in composing his verses, &quot;this would have perpetuated in a diminished form the word-music division that Verdi precisely wanted to get away from. The composer&#x27;s desire to take charge of every aspect of an opera implied that he had the power to decide what weight to give the text and the music, respectively, depending upon the &quot;moment&quot; of the action.

==Performance history==
=== 19th century ===

Budden sums up the opening night success of &quot;Ernani&quot;: nothing &quot;prevented [the opera] from being a tremendous success. With it, Verdi&#x27;s fame took a new leap which carried it at once across the boundaries of Italy. For better or worse, he was now a world composer ... [and] wherever there was an Italian opera house, &quot;Ernani&quot; arrived sooner or later.&quot; However, it was not all smooth sailing: due to Hugo&#x27;s opposition, the first performances in Paris at the Théâtre des Italiens two years later required a change of title – to &quot;Il proscritto&quot; – and a change of characters&#x27; names: &quot;The practice was followed in other cities where the names Victor Hugo and &quot;Hernani&quot; smacked of revolution.&quot; In Palermo in 1845 it became &quot;Elvira d&#x27;Aragona&quot; and in Messina in 1847 the title became &quot;Il proscritto ossia Il corsaro di Venezia&quot;. Overall, &quot;Ernani&quot; was staged in one form or another up to the mid-1850s, with &quot;32 theatres [giving] the work in 1844, 60 in 1845, and at least 65 in 1846, not including revivals in houses that had already presented it.&quot;

The United Kingdom premiere, the first of Verdi&#x27;s operas to be translated into English, took place at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in London on 8 March 1845 followed on 13 April 1847 by its US premiere in New York City.

=== 20th century and beyond ===
&quot;Ernani&quot; appeared on the roster of the Metropolitan Opera as early as 1903 and has been given many times since then. The opera was revived in a series of new productions at the San Francisco Opera (1982), the Met (1983), the Lyric Opera of Chicago (1984), and at La Scala (1984). It was given as part of the 1997 season of the Sarasota Opera&#x27;s &quot;Verdi Cycle&quot;. The Teatro Regio di Parma, another company with the aim of presenting every Verdi opera, gave it in October 2005.
Today &quot;Ernani&quot; receives numerous performances at opera houses around the world.

== Synopsis ==

:Time: 1519.
:Place: Aragon, Aachen, and Zaragoza.

===Act 1===
&quot;Mountains of Aragon&quot;

The bandits demand the reason for Ernani&#x27;s gloom (Chorus: &quot;Evviva! Beviam! Beviam!&quot; / &quot;To you we drink&quot;; &quot;Ernani pensoso!&quot; / &quot;Ernani, so gloomy? Why, oh strong one, does care sit on your brow?&quot;). Ernani replies that he loves Elvira (Recitative: &quot;Thanks, dear friends&quot;; Cavatina: &quot;Come rugiada al cespite&quot; / &quot;As the flower turns to the sun&quot;), who is about to be married against her will to old Gomez de Silva (&quot;O tu che l&#x27;alma adora&quot;). He asks the bandits to abduct her.

&quot;In Elvira&#x27;s chamber&quot;

Elvira worries about her upcoming marriage (Scena: &quot;Now sinks the sun and Silva does not return&quot;; Cavatina: &quot;Ernani, Ernani involami&quot; / &quot;Ernani, Ernani, save me&quot;) as servants deliver Silva&#x27;s wedding presents to her. She reaffirms her love for Ernani (&quot;Tutto sprezzo che d&#x27;Ernani&quot; / &quot;I scorn everything which does not speak to my heart of Ernani&quot;). King Carlo enters, declaring his love for Elvira, who rejects it, admitting she is in love with another man. As Carlo attempts to use force, she grasps a dagger, while Ernani suddenly arrives to defend her. Carlo recognizes Ernani as the leader of the bandits. (Trio: &quot;Tu se&#x27; Ernani! Me &#x27;l dice lo sdegno&quot; / &quot;You are Ernani! The scorn that invades this soul tells that to me&quot;). Ernani replies that Carlo killed his father, robbed him of his lands and forced him into a life of banditry. As he invites Carlo to fight, Silva appears and sees them both, guessing correctly that they are trying to seduce Elvira (&quot;Infelice!... e tu credevi&quot;... &quot;che mai vegg&#x27;io!&quot; / &quot;Dreadful sight&quot;; Silva&#x27;s cavatina: &quot;Unhappy man! You thought this lovely...was yours&quot;).

:[&quot;La Scala, Autumn 1844, Silva&#x27;s cabaletta added&quot;: &quot;Infin che un brando vindice&quot; &quot;using music originally written for Verdi&#x27;s first opera, Oberto&quot;]

Silva wants to fight both the seductors to restore his honour, when Riccardo approaches and recognises the king. Silva is horrified and apologizes to the king, who in turn decides to save Ernani, saying that is one of his servants. Ernani whispers to Elvira to prepare to flee, while Carlo starts talking with Silva about his rights for the Holy Roman Empire.

===Act 2===
&quot;A hall in Silva&#x27;s palace&quot;

Ernani enters disguised as a pilgrim. He asks for shelter, which Silva grants him, and then learns from Silva that he is about to marry Elvira, who believes Ernani to be dead. Ernani reveals his true identity to everyone, begging to be handed to the king. Silva however decides to keep his word and protect Ernani. The bandit then confronts Elvira, who tells him that she was planning to kill herself at the altar (Duet: &quot;Ah, morir potessi adesso&quot; / &quot;Ah, if I could die now&quot;). Silva walks in, discovering the pair, and furiously decides to kill Ernani. However, he is stopped by one of his men, Jago, who tells of the impending arrival of the king. Silva decides to hide Ernani and exact his vengeance on him later. (Trio: &quot;No, vendetta più tremenda&quot; / &quot;No, I want to keep a greater revenge&quot;). Carlo arrives and wishes to know why the castle is barred. Silva refuses to surrender Ernani (Carlo&#x27;s aria: &quot;Lo vedremo, veglio audace&quot; / &quot;We shall see, you bold old man&quot;) and Don Carlo&#x27;s men cannot find Ernani&#x27;s hiding place. Silva keeps his word, even when the king secures Elvira as a hostage. Finally alone, Silva releases Ernani, challenging him to a duel. Ernani refuses to fight, pleading to see on last time Elvira and die. After Silva reveals that the king has taken her as hostage, Ernani reveals that Carlo loves Elvira, too. After that, Silva is convinced to posticipate again his revenge on Ernani. They join forces to retrieve Elvira and kill Carlo. Therefore, Ernani swears to die whenever Silva will sound a horn he gives to him. (&quot;Se uno squillo intenderà, tosto Ernani morirà&quot; / &quot;If Ernani will hear a sound, Ernani will die at moment&quot;)

[&quot;Added for Parma, 26 December 1844: &quot;at Rossini&#x27;s request, Verdi wrote a grand aria for the tenor &quot;. Ernani gathers his men to him. His aria of vengeance: &quot;Sprezzo la vita né più m&#x27;alletta&quot; / &quot;Life means nothing to me, only hope of vengeance&quot; concludes the act]&quot;.

===Act 3===
&quot;In the burial vault of Charles the Great at Aachen&quot;

Carlo visits the grave of the emperor Charlemagne (Carlo Magno), whose successor, the new Holy Roman Emperor, is being elected by delegates from the relevant countries. Carlo resolves to change his life if he is crowned (Cavatina: &quot;Oh, de&#x27; verd&#x27;anni miei&quot;/ &quot;Oh, the dreams and deceits of my youth&quot;). Hiding behind the vault, he overhears a gathering of conspirators including Silva and Ernani. Ernani swears to murder Carlo. (Choir: &quot;Si ridesti il leon di Castiglia&quot; / &quot;Let the lion of Castille awaken&quot;) The conspiracy is foiled when Carlo&#x27;s attendants enter and surprise the conspirators. The king commands that all the traitorous noblemen be executed. Ernani steps forward, declaring that thus he must die too; he is not the bandit Ernani, but Don Juan of Aragon, whose lands were taken from him. Elvira, who had been brought to Carlo as his intended empress, begs mercy for her lover, and Carlo, whose mood has changed, forgives all the conspirators and places Elvira&#x27;s hand in that of Ernani. Silva is furious.

===Act 4===
&quot;Ernani&#x27;s Castle&quot;

Elvira and Ernani have just been married, when, in consternation, Ernani hears a bugle call. Silva arrives, wearing a mask, and hands him a cup of poison and a dagger. Ernani asks for time to &quot;sip from the cup of love&quot; (&quot;Ascolta, ascolta un detto ancor&quot;/ &quot;Listen, just one word...&quot;) but, cursed by Silva as a coward, Ernani keeps his oath and stabs himself in the heart (Trio with Silva: &quot;È vano, o donna, il piangere, è vano&quot; / &quot;Your weeping is in vain, woman&quot;). He dies in Elvira&#x27;s arms, telling her to live.

&quot;Ernani&quot; is scored for one piccolo, one flute, two oboes, two clarinets, one bass clarinet, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, one cimbasso, one harp, timpani, bass drum and cymbals, snare drum, on-stage band with on-stage bass drum, one offstage horn, six offstage trumpets, and strings.

==Music==
Noting that the dramatic structure of this opera &quot;brought about a fresh consideration of the fixed forms of Italian opera, in particular an expansion and enrichment of the solo aria and duet together with a more flexible approach to the musical sequences that bind together lyrical pieces&quot;, Roger Parker continues by stating that of greatest importance was &quot;Verdi&#x27;s gathering sense of musical drama&#x27;s larger rhetoric, his increasing control over the dynamics of entire acts rather than merely of entire numbers. In this respect, the third act of &quot;Ernani&quot; sets up an imposing standard of coherence, one that is rarely equalled until the operas of the early 1850s.&quot;

However, it is writer Gabriele Baldini (whose specialization was in English literature) who in 1980 points to one of the most significant aspects of &quot;Ernani&quot;&#x27;s dramatic and musical structure, the concept of male vocal archetypes, something which is echoed in Budden&#x27;s 1984 chapter on this opera. Baldini writes of the musical conflicts inherent in the drama as a result of the use of certain voice types:

A youthful, passionate female voice is besieged by three male voices, each of whom establishes a specific relationship with her. The siege is fruitless. The male voices, or rather registers, meet with various fates, and each is granted a relationship with the woman, although on different levels. This relationship varies in intensity of passion according to the distance between the soprano register and the particular male voice.

Therefore, it is the lowest voice [the bass, de Silva], which is &quot;farthest away, and thus his relationship is the coldest and most retrained&quot;. The baritone [the King, Don Carlo] &quot;manages to draw somewhat closer, although indirectly and ambiguously&quot;, but Baldini continues by noting that it the highest male voice [the tenor, Ernani] who &quot;gets near a relationship which if not complete ... is at least reciprocated for long periods&quot;.

Finally, while Baldini agrees with Parker that it is act 3 of &quot;Ernani&quot; which is the strongest – &quot;in my opinion it marks the first occasion on which Verdi enclosed within a fairly extended musical space (about twenty five minutes) a perfect structural unit&quot; – he also echoes Budden and De Van in noting the importance of the opening horn motif and references to the horn which recur throughout the opera and which ends with the final horn call, the fatal summons to Ernani by de Silva.

==Recordings==
The first complete recording of an opera was the 1904 recording of &quot;Ernani&quot;, on 40 single-sided discs, by the Gramophone Company in England. Later recordings include:

<doc id="37909" wikidata="Q179110" url="?curid=37909" title="Don Carlos">
<text>Don Carlos is an 1867 five-act grand opera composed by Giuseppe Verdi to a French-language libretto by Joseph Méry and Camille du Locle, based on the 1787 play &quot;Don Karlos, Infant von Spanien&quot; (&quot;Don Carlos, Infante of Spain&quot;) by Friedrich Schiller and several incidents from Eugène Cormon&#x27;s 1846 play &quot;Philippe II, Roi d&#x27;Espagne&quot;. The opera is most often performed in Italian translation, usually under the title Don Carlo.

The opera&#x27;s story is based on conflicts in the life of Carlos, Prince of Asturias (1545–1568). Though he was betrothed to Elisabeth of Valois, part of the peace treaty ending the Italian War of 1551–59 between the Houses of Habsburg and Valois demanded that she be married instead to his father Philip II of Spain. It was commissioned and produced by the Théâtre Impérial de l&#x27;Opéra (Paris Opera) and given its premiere at the Salle Le Peletier on 11 March 1867.

The first performance in Italian was given at Covent Garden in London in June 1867. The first performance in Italy was in Bologna in October 1867, also in Italian translation. After some revisions by Verdi, it was performed in Italian in Naples in November/December 1872. Verdi was also responsible for a short four-act &quot;Milan version&quot; in which the first act was removed and the ballet omitted (performed in Milan in January 1884 in Italian translation) but also apparently approved a five-act &quot;Modena version&quot; in which the first act was restored but the ballet still omitted (performed in Modena in December 1886, also in Italian translation). Around 1970, substantial passages of music cut before the premiere were discovered in Paris archives, giving rise to at least one additional version that can be ascribed to Verdi: the version he prepared for the Paris Opera in 1866, before any cuts were made. No other Verdi opera exists in so many authentic versions. At its full length (including the ballet and the cuts made before the first performance), it contains close to four hours of music and is Verdi&#x27;s longest opera.

==Composition history==
Pre-première cuts and first published edition

Verdi made a number of cuts in 1866, after finishing the opera but before composing the ballet, simply because the work was becoming too long. These were a duet for Elisabeth and Eboli in Act 4, Scene 1; a duet for Carlos and the King after the death of Posa in Act 4, Scene 2; and an exchange between Elisabeth and Eboli during the insurrection in the same scene.

After the ballet had been composed, it emerged during the 1867 rehearsal period that, without further cuts, the opera would not finish before midnight (the time by which patrons would need to leave in order to catch the last trains to the Paris suburbs). Verdi then authorised some further cuts, which were, firstly, the introduction to Act 1 (with a chorus of woodcutters and their wives, and including the first appearance of Elisabeth); secondly, a short entry solo for Posa (&quot;J&#x27;étais en Flandres&quot;) in Act 2, Scene 1; and, thirdly, part of the dialogue between the King and Posa at the end of Act 2, Scene 2.

The opera was first published as given at the première and consisted of Verdi&#x27;s original conception, without the music of the above-named cuts, but with the ballet.

In 1969, at a Verdi congress in Verona, the American musicologist David Rosen presented the missing section from the Philip-Posa duet from the end of Act 2, which he had found folded down in the conductor&#x27;s copy of the score. Other pages with cuts had simply been removed from the autograph score and the conductor&#x27;s copy. Shortly thereafter, the British music critic Andrew Porter found most of these other cut passages could be reconstructed from the individual parts, in which the pages with the &quot;lost&quot; music had been either &quot;pasted, pinned or stitched down.&quot; In all, 21 minutes of missing music was restored. Nearly all of the known music Verdi composed for the opera, including the pre-première cuts and later revisions, can be found in an integral edition prepared by the German musicologist Ursula Günther, first published in 1980 and in a second, revised version in 1986.

==Performance history==

===19th century===

====As &quot;Don Carlos&quot; in French====
After the première and before leaving Paris, Verdi authorised the Opéra authorities to end Act 4, Scene 2 with the death of Posa (thereby omitting the insurrection scene) if they thought fit. This was done, beginning with the second performance on 13 March, after his departure. Further (unauthorised) cuts were apparently made during the remaining performances. Despite a grandiose production designed by scenic artists Charles-Antoine Cambon and Joseph Thierry (Acts I and III), Édouard Desplechin and Jean-Baptiste Lavastre (Acts II and V), and Auguste Alfred Rubé and Philippe Chaperon (Act IV), it appears to have been a &quot;problem opera&quot; for the Opéra—it disappeared from its repertoire after 1869.

====As &quot;Don Carlo&quot; in an Italian translation====
It was common practice at the time for most theatres (other than those in French-speaking communities) to perform operas in Italian, and an Italian translation of &quot;Don Carlos&quot; was prepared in the autumn of 1866 by Achille de Lauzières. On 18 November 1866 Verdi wrote to Giovanni Ricordi, offering the Milan publisher the Italian rights, but insisting that the opera:
:must be performed in its entirety as it will be performed for the first time at the Paris Opéra. &quot;Don Carlos&quot; is an opera in five acts with ballet: if nevertheless the management of Italian theatres would like to pair it with a different ballet, this must be placed either before or after the uncut opera, never in the middle, following the barbarous custom of our day.

However, the Italian translation was first performed not in Italy but in London at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden on 4 June 1867, where it was produced and conducted by Michael Costa. However, it was not as Verdi desired; the opera was given in a cut and altered form, with the first act being removed, the ballet in Act 3 being omitted, and Carlo&#x27;s aria &quot;Io la vidi&quot; (originally in Act 1) being moved to Act 3, just before the terzetto. Additionally, the duet between Philip and the Inquisitor was shortened by four lines, and Elisabeth&#x27;s aria in Act 5 consisted only of part of the middle section and the reprise. The production was initially considered a success, and Verdi sent a congratulatory note to Costa. Later when he learned of the alterations, Verdi was greatly irritated, but Costa&#x27;s version anticipated revisions Verdi himself would make a few years later in 1882–83.

The Italian premiere on 27 October 1867 at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna, conducted by Verdi&#x27;s close friend Angelo Mariani, was an &quot;instant success&quot;, and this version, although produced in Verdi&#x27;s absence, was more complete and included the ballet. For the Rome premiere on 9 February 1868 at the Teatro Apollo, perhaps unsurprisingly, the Papal censor changed the Inquisitor into a Gran Cancelliere (Grand Chancellor) and the Monk/Emperor into a Solitario (Recluse).

This version of the opera was first performed in Milan at La Scala on 25 March 1868, and prestige productions in most other Italian opera houses followed, but it did not become a popular success. The length was a particular problem, and subsequent performances were generally heavily cut. The first production in Naples in 1871 was indisputably a failure.

====1872 revisions for Naples====
Following the unsuccessful performance in Naples in 1871, Verdi was persuaded to visit the city for further performances in November / December 1872, and he made two more modifications to the score: (a) a revision of the closing two-thirds of the Philippe-Rodrigue duet in Act 2, Scene 2 (to Italian verses, almost certainly by Antonio Ghislanzoni), which replaced some of the previously cut material, and (b) the removal of the &quot;allegro marziale&quot; section of the final Elisabeth-Carlos duet (replaced with an 8-bar patch). These are the only portions of the opera that were composed to an Italian rather than a French text. According to Julian Budden, Verdi &quot;was to regret both modifications&quot;. Ricordi incorporated the revisions into later prints of the opera without changing the plate numbers. This subsequently confused some authors, e.g. Francis Toye and Ernest Newman, who dated them to 1883.

====1882/83 and 1886 revisions: &quot;Milan version&quot; and &quot;Modena version&quot;====
The idea of reducing the scope and scale of &quot;Don Carlos&quot; had originally come to Verdi in 1875, partly as a result of his having heard reports of productions, such as Costa&#x27;s, which had removed Act 1 and the ballet and introduced cuts to other parts of the opera. By April 1882, he was in Paris where he was ready to make changes. He was already familiar with the work of Charles-Louis-Étienne Nuitter, who had worked on French translations of &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;La forza del destino&quot; and &quot;Aida&quot; with du Locle, and the three proceeded to spend nine months on major revisions of the French text and the music to create a four-act version. This omitted Act 1 and the ballet, and was completed by March 1883. An Italian translation of this revised French text, re-using much of the original 1866 translation by de Lauzières, was made by . The La Scala première of the 1883 revised version took place on 10 January 1884 in Italian.

Although Verdi had accepted the need to remove the first act, it seems that he changed his mind and allowed a performance which presented the &quot;Fontainebleau&quot; first act along with the revised four-act version. It was given on 29 December 1886 in Modena, and has become known as the &quot;Modena version&quot;, which was published by Ricordi as &quot;a new edition in five acts without ballet&quot;.

===20th century and beyond===
In Italian

Performances of &quot;Don Carlo&quot; in the first half of the twentieth century were rare, but in the post Second World War period it has been regularly performed, particularly in the four-act 1884 &quot;Milan version&quot; in Italian. In 1950, to open Rudolf Bing&#x27;s first season as director of the Metropolitan Opera, the four-act version was performed without the ballet in a production by Margaret Webster with Jussi Björling in the title role, Delia Rigal as Elizabeth, Robert Merrill as Rodrigo, Fedora Barbieri as Eboli, Cesare Siepi as Philip II and Jerome Hines as the Grand Inquisitor. This version was performed there until 1972. The four-act version in Italian continued to be championed by conductors such as Herbert von Karajan (1978 audio recording and 1986 video recording) and Riccardo Muti (1992 video recording).

Also influential was a 1958 staging of the 1886 five-act &quot;Modena version&quot; in Italian by The Royal Opera company, Covent Garden, directed by Luchino Visconti and conducted by Carlo Maria Giulini. The cast included Jon Vickers as Don Carlo, Tito Gobbi as Rodrigo, Boris Christoff as King Phillip and Gré Brouwenstijn as Elizabeth. This version has increasingly been performed elsewhere and has been recorded by, among others, Georg Solti and Giulini.

After the discovery of music cut before the premiere, conductors began performing five-act versions that included some of it. In 1973 at La Fenice, Georges Prêtre conducted a 5-act version in Italian without the ballet that included the discarded woodcutters scene, the first Carlo-Rodrigo duet in a hybrid beginning with the Paris edition but ending with the Milan revision, the discarded Elisabeth-Eboli duet from Act 4, and the Paris finale. In 1975, Charles Mackerras conducted an expanded and modified five-act version (with Verdi&#x27;s original prelude, the woodcutters&#x27; scene and the original Paris ending) in an English translation for English National Opera at the London Coliseum. In 1978, Claudio Abbado mounted an expanded five-act version in Italian at La Scala. The cast included Mirella Freni as Elizabeth, Elena Obraztsova and Viorica Cortez as Eboli, José Carreras in the title role, Piero Cappuccilli as Rodrigo, Nicolai Ghiaurov as King Phillip, and Evgeny Nesterenko as the Grand Inquisitor. On 5 February 1979, James Levine conducted an expanded five-act version in Italian at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. The cast included Renata Scotto as Elizabeth, Marilyn Horne as Eboli, Giuseppe Giacomini as Don Carlo, Sherrill Milnes as Rodrigo, Nicolai Ghiaurov as King Philip, and James Morris as the Grand Inquisitor.

Today, as translated into Italian and presented in four-act and five-act versions, the opera has become part of the standard repertory.

In French

Stagings and broadcasts of five-act French versions of the opera have become more frequent in the later 20th and into the 21st century. Up to 1973, these productions consisted of the revised and abridged four-act score of 1882–83 prefaced by the shortened, revised Act 1 set in Fontainebleau. A radio broadcast by ORTF in France was given in 1967 with a nearly all-French cast, with the exception of the Italian Matteo Manuguerra as Rodrigue. A five-act French version was performed at La Scala Milan in 1970.

On 22 May 1973, the Opera Company of Boston under the direction of Sarah Caldwell presented a nearly complete five-act French version which included the 21 minutes of music cut before the premiere, but not the ballet. The 1867 version was used, since the restored music does not easily fit with the 1886 revised version. The cast included John Alexander in the title role, the French-Canadian Édith Tremblay as Élisabeth, the French singer as Princess Eboli, William Dooley as Rodrigue and Donald Gramm as Philippe. According to Andrew Porter, the Boston production was &quot;the first performance, ever, of the immense opera that Verdi prepared in 1867; and in doing so it opened a new chapter in the stage history of the piece.&quot;

The BBC Concert Orchestra under John Matheson broadcast the opera in June 1973 with the roles of Don Carlos sung by André Turp, Philippe II by Joseph Rouleau, and Rodrigue by Robert Savoie. Julian Budden comments that &quot;this was the first complete performance of what could be called the 1866 conception in French with the addition of the ballet.&quot;

Several notable productions of five-act French versions have been mounted more recently. A five-act French version was performed by the Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels in 1983. A co-production between the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris and the Royal Opera in London in 1996 used Andrew Porter as a consultant and was a &quot;judicious mixture&quot; of music from the 1866 original and the 1883 revision. The production, staged by Luc Bondy, was also shared with the opera houses in Brussels, Nice and Lyon. The performance by the Paris cast (March 1996), was conducted by Antonio Pappano with Roberto Alagna as Don Carlos, Karita Mattila as Elisabeth, Thomas Hampson as Rodrigue, José Van Dam as Philippe II and Waltraud Meier as Eboli. It was recorded on videotape and is now available in a remastered HD video format.

A Vienna State Opera production, staged by Peter Konwitschny and performed in Vienna in October 2004, included all of the music excised during the Paris rehearsal period plus the ballet. Patrick O&#x27;Connor, writing in the &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine, reports the ballet was &quot;staged as &#x27;Eboli&#x27;s Dream&#x27;. She and Don Carlos are living in suburban bliss, and have Philip and Elisabeth round for a pizza, delivered by Rodrigo. Musically, the performance, apart from the Auto-da-fé scene, has a lot going for it under the direction of Bertrand de Billy.&quot; A DVD video recording is available.

On 17 September 2005 a co-production directed by John Caird of the largely uncut Paris version in French between the Welsh National Opera and the Canadian Opera Company (Toronto) was premiered by the WNO at the Wales Millennium Center. The performance was conducted by Carlo Rizzi with Nuccia Focile as Elizabeth, Paul Charles Clarke as Don Carlos, Scott Hendricks as Rodrigue, Guang Yang as Eboli, Andrea Silvestrelli as Philippe II, and Daniel Sumegi as the Grand Inquisitor. The production was taken on tour to Edinburgh, Oxford, Birmingham, Bristol, Southampton and Liverpool. It was performed by the Canadian Opera Company in Toronto in October/November 2007 with a different cast. The production was performed several times by the Houston Grand Opera from 13 April 2012 until 28 April. The Houston production was conducted by Patrick Summers with Brandon Jovanovich as Don Carlos, Tamara Wilson as Elizabeth, Andrea Silvestrelli as Philippe II, Christine Goerke as Eboli, Scott Hendricks as Rodrigue and Samuel Ramey as the Grand Inquisitor.

In 2017, the Opéra National de Paris performed the 1866 French version (before the ballet was composed) in a production staged by Krzysztof Warlikowski at the Bastille. Conducted by Philippe Jordan, the cast included Jonas Kaufmann as Don Carlos, Sonya Yoncheva as Elisabeth, Ludovic Tézier as Rodrigue, Ildar Abdrazakov as Philippe II and Elīna Garanča as Eboli. The Metropolitan Opera presented the opera in French for the first time in 2022 in the Modena version, with tenor Matthew Polenzani in the title role.

==Roles==


== Synopsis ==
:[This synopsis is based on the original five-act version composed for Paris and completed in 1866. Important changes for subsequent versions are noted in indented brackets. First lines of arias, etc., are given in French and Italian].

===Act 1===
:[This act was omitted in the 1883 revision]

&quot;The Forest of Fontainebleau, France in winter&quot;

A prelude and chorus of woodcutters and their wives is heard. They complain of their hard life, made worse by war with Spain. Elisabeth, daughter of the King of France, arrives with her attendants. She reassures the people that her impending marriage to Don Carlos, Infante and son of Philip II, King of Spain, will bring the war to an end, and departs.

:[The preceding prelude and chorus of woodcutters was cut before the Paris première and replaced by a short scene in which Elisabeth crosses the stage and hands out money to the woodcutters; she exits without singing. The prelude and chorus of woodcutters was also omitted when Act 1 was restored in the 1886 five-act Modena version.]

Carlos, coming out from hiding, has seen Elisabeth and fallen in love with her (Aria: &quot;Je l&#x27;ai vue&quot; / &quot;Io la vidi&quot;). When she reappears, he initially pretends to be a member of the Count of Lerma&#x27;s delegation. She asks him about Don Carlos, whom she has not yet met. Before long, Carlos reveals his true identity and his feelings, which she reciprocates (Duet: &quot;De quels transports poignants et doux&quot; / &quot;Di quale amor, di quanto ardor&quot;). A cannon-shot signifies that peace has been declared between Spain and France. Thibault appears and gives Elisabeth the surprising news that her hand is to be claimed not by Carlos but by his father, Philip. When Lerma and his followers confirm this, Elisabeth is devastated but feels bound to accept, in order to consolidate the peace. She departs for Spain, leaving Carlos equally devastated.

===Act 2===
:[This is Act 1 in the 1883 revision]

&quot;Scene 1: The monastery of Saint-Just (San Jerónimo de Yuste) in Spain&quot;

The scene takes place soon after King Philip II and Elisabeth have married. Monks pray before the tomb of the former Emperor Charles V (&quot;Carlo Quinto&quot;). The monks&#x27; leader proclaims that the Emperor was proud but has been humbled through error.

Don Carlos enters, anguished that the woman he loves is now his stepmother.

:[In the 1883 revision, he sings a revised version of the aria &quot;Je l&#x27;ai vue&quot; / &quot;Io la vidi&quot;, which was salvaged from the omitted first act but with some different music and different text to reflect his current situation. In the four-act version he already knows that he cannot marry Elisabeth. In the original, when singing the aria, he was still expecting to marry her]

When Carlos pauses in his lament, the leader of the monks proclaims that the turbulence of the world persists even in sacred places; we cannot rest except in Heaven. The sound of his voice frightens Carlos, who thinks it sounds like that of the Emperor Charles V. Carlos further notices that the monk physically resembles the Emperor, and recalls hearing rumors that the Emperor&#x27;s ghost haunts the monastery.

Carlos&#x27; dear friend Rodrigue, Marquis of Posa, who has just arrived from the oppressed land of Flanders, enters. The two greet each other joyfully (Aria: &quot;J&#x27;étais en Flandres&quot;).

Rodrigue asks for the Infante&#x27;s aid on behalf of the suffering people there. Carlos reveals that he loves his stepmother. Rodrigue is first shocked, but then sympathetic. He encourages Carlos to leave Spain and go to Flanders, and to forget his pain by focusing on political activity there. The two men swear eternal friendship (Duet: &quot;Dieu, tu semas dans nos âmes&quot; / &quot;Dio, che nell&#x27;alma infondere&quot;).

King Philip and his new wife, with their attendants, enter also to do homage at Charles V&#x27;s tomb, while Don Carlos laments his lost love.

&quot;Scene 2: A garden near Saint-Just&quot;

Princess Eboli sings the Veil Song (&quot;Au palais des fées&quot; / &quot;Nel giardin del bello&quot;) about a Moorish King trying to seduce an alluring veiled beauty, who turns out to be his own neglected wife. Elisabeth enters. Rodrigue gives her a letter from France, which covers a secret note from Don Carlos. At his urging (Aria: &quot;L&#x27;Infant Carlos, notre espérance&quot; / &quot;Carlo ch&#x27;è sol il nostro amore&quot;), Elisabeth agrees to see the Infante alone. Unaware of this relationship, Eboli infers that she, Eboli, is the one Don Carlos loves.

When they are alone, Don Carlos tells Elisabeth that he is miserable, and asks her to request the King to send him to Flanders. She promptly agrees, provoking Carlos to renew his declarations of love, which she piously rejects. Don Carlos exits in a frenzy, shouting that he must be under a curse. The King enters and becomes angry because the Queen is alone and unattended. His suspicions are insulting to her. He orders the lady-in-waiting who was meant to be attending her, the Countess of Aremberg, to return to France, prompting Elizabeth to sing a sorrowful farewell-aria. (Aria: &quot;Oh ma chère compagne&quot; / &quot;Non pianger, mia compagna&quot;).

The King now approaches Rodrigue, with whose character and activism he is impressed, and offers to reward him for his loyalty and service. Rodrigue begs the King to stop oppressing the people of Flanders. The King calls Rodrigue&#x27;s idealism unrealistic and warns that the Grand Inquisitor is watching him. The King confides in Rodrigue, telling him that he fears that Carlos is having an affair with Elisabeth. Rodrigue replies that Carlos is innocent, and offers to watch Elisabeth and to be responsible for her good behavior. The King gratefully accepts this offer, and again warns Rodrigue to beware of the Grand Inquisitor.

:[This dialogue was revised three times by Verdi.]
===Act 3===
:[This is Act 2 in the 1883 revision]

&quot;Scene 1: Evening in the Queen&#x27;s garden in Madrid&quot;

Elisabeth is tired, and wishes to concentrate on the following day&#x27;s coronation of the King. To avoid the &quot;divertissement&quot; planned for the evening, she exchanges masks with Eboli, assuming that thereby her absence will not be noticed, and leaves.

:[This scene was omitted from the 1883 revision]

:[In the première, the ballet (choreographed by Lucien Petipa and entitled &quot;La Pérégrina&quot;) took place at this point]

At midnight, Don Carlos enters, clutching a note suggesting a tryst in the gardens. Although he thinks this is from Elisabeth, it is really from Eboli. Eboli, who still thinks Don Carlos loves her, enters. Don Carlos mistakes her for Elisabeth in the dark, and passionately declares his love. When he sees Eboli&#x27;s face, he realizes his error and recoils from her. Eboli guesses his secret—that he was expecting the Queen, whom he loves. She threatens to tell the King that Elisabeth and Carlos are lovers. Carlos, terrified, begs for mercy. Rodrigue enters, and warns her not to cross him; he is the King&#x27;s confidant. Eboli replies by hinting darkly that she is a formidable and dangerous foe, with power which Rodrigue does not yet know about. (Her power is that she is having an affair with the King, but she does not reveal this yet.) Rodrigue draws his dagger, intending to stab her to death, but reconsiders, spares her, and declares his trust in the Lord. Eboli exits in a vengeful rage. Rodrigue advises Carlos to entrust to him any sensitive, potentially incriminating political documents that he may have and, when Carlos agrees, they reaffirm their friendship.

&quot;Scene 2: In front of the Cathedral of Valladolid&quot;
Preparations are being made for an &quot;auto-da-fé&quot;, the public parade and burning of condemned heretics. While the people celebrate, monks drag the condemned to the woodpile. A royal procession follows, and the King addresses the populace, promising to protect them with fire and sword. Don Carlos enters with six Flemish envoys, who plead with the King for their country&#x27;s freedom. Although the people and the court are sympathetic, the King, supported by the monks, orders his guards to arrest the envoys. Carlos demands that the King grant him authority to govern Flanders; the King scornfully refuses. Enraged, Carlos draws his sword against the King. The King calls for help but the guards will not attack Don Carlos. Rodrigue realizes that actually attacking the King would be disastrous for Carlos. He steps forward and defuses the situation by taking Carlos&#x27; sword from him. Carlos, astonished, yields to his friend without resisting. Relieved and grateful, the King raises Rodrigue to the rank of Duke. The guards arrest Carlos, the monks fire the woodpile, and as the flames start to rise, a heavenly voice can be heard promising heavenly peace to the condemned souls.

===Act 4===
:[This is Act 3 in the 1883 revision]

&quot;Scene 1: Dawn in King Philip&#x27;s study in Madrid&quot;

Alone and suffering from insomnia, the King, in a reverie, laments that Elisabeth has never loved him, that his position means that he has to be eternally vigilant and that he will only sleep properly when he is in his tomb in the Escorial (Aria: &quot;Elle ne m&#x27;aime pas&quot; / &quot;Ella giammai m&#x27;amò&quot;). The blind, ninety-year-old Grand Inquisitor is announced and shuffles into the King&#x27;s apartment. When the King asks if the Church will object to him putting his own son to death, the Inquisitor replies that the King will be in good company: God sacrificed &quot;His&quot; own son. In return for his support, the Inquisitor demands that the King have Rodrigue killed. The King refuses at first to kill his friend, whom he admires and likes. However, the Grand Inquisitor reminds the King that the Inquisition can take down any king; he has created and destroyed other rulers before. Frightened and overwhelmed, the King begs the Grand Inquisitor to forget about the past discussion. The latter replies &quot;Peut-être&quot; / &quot;Forse!&quot; – perhaps! – and leaves. The King bitterly muses on his helplessness to oppose the Church.

Elisabeth enters, alarmed at the apparent theft of her jewel casket. However, the King produces it and points to the portrait of Don Carlos which it contains, accusing her of adultery. She protests her innocence but, when the King threatens her, she faints. In response to his calls for help, into the chamber come Eboli and Rodrigue. Their laments of suspicion cause the King to realize that he has been wrong to suspect his wife (Quartet: &quot;Maudit soit le soupçon infâme&quot; / &quot;Ah, sia maledetto, il rio sospetto&quot;). Aside, Rodrigue resolves to save Carlos, though it may mean his own death. Eboli feels remorse for betraying Elisabeth; the latter, recovering, expresses her despair.

:[The quartet was revised by Verdi in 1883 and begins: &quot;Maudit soit, maudit le soupçon infâme&quot; / &quot;Ah! sii maledetto, sospetto fatale&quot;.]

Elisabeth and Eboli are left together. Eboli confesses that it was she who told the King that Elisabeth and Carlos were having an affair, for revenge against Carlos for having rejected her. This is followed by the duet &quot;J&#x27;ai tout compris&quot;. Eboli also confesses that she herself is guilty of that which she accused the Queen, and has become the King&#x27;s mistress. Elisabeth leaves, and the Count di Lerma orders Eboli to choose between exile or the convent, then leaves.

:[At the premiere, the duet &quot;J&#x27;ai tout compris&quot; and Eboli&#x27;s second confession, of her affair with the king, were omitted. Elisabeth orders Eboli to choose between exile or the convent immediately after Eboli&#x27;s first confession. In 1883, the duet was omitted, but Eboli&#x27;s second confession was reinstated in a revised version, and Elisabeth remains on stage to sing the Count di Lerma&#x27;s lines.]

Eboli, left alone, curses her own beauty and pride, and resolves to make amends by trying to save Carlos from the Inquisition (Aria: &quot;O don fatal&quot; / &quot;O don fatale&quot;).

&quot;Scene 2: A prison&quot;

Don Carlos has been imprisoned. Rodrigue arrives and tells Carlos that he (Rodrigue) has saved Carlos from being executed, by allowing himself (Rodrigue) to be incriminated by the politically sensitive documents which he had obtained from Carlos earlier (Aria, part 1: &quot;C&#x27;est mon jour suprême&quot; / &quot;Per me giunto è il dì supremo&quot;). A shadowy figure appears—one of the Grand Inquisitor&#x27;s assassins—and shoots Rodrigue in the chest. As he dies, Rodrigue tells Carlos that Elisabeth will meet him at Saint-Just the following day. He adds that he is content to die if his friend can save Flanders and rule over a happier Spain (Aria, part 2: &quot;Ah, je meurs, l&#x27;âme joyeuse&quot; / &quot;Io morrò, ma lieto in core&quot;). At that moment, the King enters, offering his son freedom, as Rodrigue had arranged. Carlos repulses him for having murdered Rodrigue. The King sees that Rodrigue is dead and cries out in sorrow.

:[Duet: Carlos and the King- &quot;Qui me rendra ce mort ?&quot; /&quot;Chi rende a me quest&#x27;uom&quot; It was cut before the première and, following it, Verdi authorized its optional removal. The music was later re-used by Verdi for the Lacrimosa of his &quot;Messa da Requiem&quot; of 1874]

Bells ring as Elisabeth and Eboli enter. The crowd pushes its way into the prison and threatens the King, demanding the release of Carlos. In the confusion, Eboli escapes with Carlos. The people are brave enough at first in the presence of the King, but they are terrified by the arrival of the Grand Inquisitor, and instantly obey his angry command to quiet down and pay homage to the King.

:[After the première, some productions ended this act with the death of Rodrigue. However, in 1883 Verdi provided a much shortened version of the insurrection, as he felt that otherwise it would not be clear how Eboli had fulfilled her promise to rescue Carlos]

===Act 5===
:[This is Act 4 in the 1883 revision]

&quot;The moonlit monastery of Yuste&quot;

Elisabeth kneels before the tomb of Charles V. She is committed to help Don Carlos on his way to fulfill his destiny in Flanders, but she herself longs only for death (Aria: &quot;Toi qui sus le néant&quot; / &quot;Tu che le vanità&quot;). Carlos appears and tells her that he has overcome his desire for her; he now loves her honorably, as a son loves his mother. They say a final farewell, promising to meet again in Heaven (Duet: &quot;Au revoir dans un monde où la vie est meilleure&quot; / &quot;Ma lassù ci vedremo in un mondo migliore&quot;).

:[This duet was twice revised by Verdi]

The King and the Grand Inquisitor enter, with several armed guards. The King infers that Carlos and Elisabeth have been lovers and demands that they both be immediately killed in a double sacrifice. The Inquisitor confirms that the Inquisition will do its duty. A short summary trial follows, confirming Carlos&#x27;s putative culpability.

:[The trial was omitted in 1883 and does not occur on any commercially available audio recording, although it was performed at La Scala in 1978. It was performed in Vienna in 2004 and recorded on video.]

Carlos, cries &quot;Ah, God will avenge me, this tribunal of blood, His hand will crush.&quot; Defending himself, Carlos retreats towards the tomb of Charles V. The gate opens, the Monk appears, draws Carlos into his arms, covers him with his coat and sings: &quot;My son, the pains of the earth still follow us in this place, the peace your heart hopes for is found only with God.&quot; The King and the Inquisitor recognize the Monk&#x27;s voice: he is the King&#x27;s father, Charles V, who was believed dead. As the curtain slowly falls, the Monk leads the distraught Carlos into the cloister to the chanting of monks in the chapel that &quot;Charles V, the august Emperor is naught but ash and dust.&quot; The opera concludes softly with pianissimo chords and tremolos played by the strings.

:[The ending was revised in 1883, with the Monk singing a tone higher. The score explicitly indicates he is Charles V with royal robe and crown, and the chanting of the monks is no longer sung, but &quot;thundered out as a brass chorale.&quot;]

<doc id="37910" wikidata="Q40218" url="?curid=37910" title="Spacecraft">
<text>A spacecraft is a vehicle that is designed to fly and operate in outer space. Spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes, including communications, Earth observation, meteorology, navigation, space colonization, planetary exploration, and transportation of humans and cargo. All spacecraft except single-stage-to-orbit vehicles cannot get into space on their own, and require a launch vehicle (carrier rocket).

On a sub-orbital spaceflight, a space vehicle enters space and then returns to the surface without having gained sufficient energy or velocity to make a full Earth orbit. For orbital spaceflights, spacecraft enter closed orbits around the Earth or around other celestial bodies. Spacecraft used for human spaceflight carry people on board as crew or passengers from start or on orbit (space stations) only, whereas those used for robotic space missions operate either autonomously or telerobotically. Robotic spacecraft used to support scientific research are space probes. Robotic spacecraft that remain in orbit around a planetary body are artificial satellites. To date, only a handful of interstellar probes, such as &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; and &quot;11&quot;, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;, and &quot;New Horizons,&quot;are on trajectories that leave the Solar System.

Orbital spacecraft may be recoverable or not. Most are not. Recoverable spacecraft may be subdivided by a method of reentry to Earth into non-winged space capsules and winged spaceplanes. Recoverable spacecraft may be reusable (can be launched again or several times, like the SpaceX Dragon and the Space Shuttle orbiters) or expendable (like the Soyuz). In recent years, more space agencies are tending towards reusable spacecraft.

Humanity has achieved space flight, but only a few nations have the technology for orbital launches: Russia (Roscosmos), the United States (NASA), the member states of the European Space Agency, Japan (JAXA), China (CNSA), India (ISRO), Taiwan (TSA), Israel (ISA), Iran (ISA), and North Korea (NADA). In addition, several private companies have developed or are developing the technology for orbital launches independently from government agencies. Two prominent examples of such companies are SpaceX and Blue Origin.

== History ==

A German V-2 became the first spacecraft when it reached an altitude of 189 km in June 1944 in Peenemünde, Germany. Sputnik 1 was the first artificial satellite. It was launched into an elliptical low Earth orbit (LEO) by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957. The launch ushered in new political, military, technological, and scientific developments; while the Sputnik launch was a single event, it marked the start of the Space Age. Apart from its value as a technological first, Sputnik 1 also helped to identify the upper atmospheric layer&#x27;s density, by measuring the satellite&#x27;s orbital changes. It also provided data on radio-signal distribution in the ionosphere. Pressurized nitrogen in the satellite&#x27;s false body provided the first opportunity for meteoroid detection. Sputnik 1 was launched during the International Geophysical Year from Site No.1/5, at the 5th Tyuratam range, in Kazakh SSR (now at the Baikonur Cosmodrome). The satellite travelled at , taking 96.2 minutes to complete an orbit, and emitted radio signals at 20.005 and 40.002 MHz

While Sputnik 1 was the first spacecraft to orbit the Earth, other human-made objects had previously reached an altitude of 100 km, which is the height required by the international organization Fédération Aéronautique Internationale to count as a spaceflight. This altitude is called the Kármán line. In particular, in the 1940s there were several test launches of the V-2 rocket, some of which reached altitudes well over 100 km.

== Crewed and uncrewed spacecraft ==

=== Crewed spacecraft ===
As of 2016, only three nations have flown crewed spacecraft: USSR/Russia, USA, and China.
The first crewed spacecraft was Vostok 1, which carried Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into space in 1961, and completed a full Earth orbit. There were five other crewed missions which used a Vostok spacecraft. The second crewed spacecraft was named &quot;Freedom 7&quot;, and it performed a sub-orbital spaceflight in 1961 carrying American astronaut Alan Shepard to an altitude of just over . There were five other crewed missions using Mercury spacecraft.

Other Soviet crewed spacecraft include the Voskhod, Soyuz, flown uncrewed as Zond/L1, L3, TKS, and the Salyut and &quot;Mir&quot; crewed space stations. Other American crewed spacecraft include the Gemini spacecraft, the Apollo spacecraft including the Apollo Lunar Module, the Skylab space station, the Space Shuttle with undetached European Spacelab and private US Spacehab space stations-modules, and the SpaceX Crew Dragon configuration of their Dragon 2. US company Boeing also developed and flown a spacecraft of their own, the CST-100, commonly referred to as Starliner, but a crewed flight is yet to occur. China developed, but did not fly Shuguang, and is currently using Shenzhou (its first crewed mission was in 2003).

Except for the Space Shuttle and the Buran spaceplane of the Soviet Union, the latter of which only ever had one uncrewed test flight, all of the recoverable crewed orbital spacecraft were space capsules.

The International Space Station, crewed since November 2000, is a joint venture between Russia, the United States, Canada and several other countries.

=== Uncrewed spacecraft ===

Uncrewed spacecraft are spacecraft without people on board. Uncrewed spacecraft may have varying levels of autonomy from human input; they may be remote controlled, remote guided or even autonomous, meaning they have a pre-programmed list of operations, which they will execute unless otherwise instructed.

Many space missions are more suited to telerobotic rather than crewed operation, due to lower cost and lower risk factors. In addition, some planetary destinations such as Venus or the vicinity of Jupiter are too hostile for human survival. Outer planets such as Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are too distant to reach with current crewed spaceflight technology, so telerobotic probes are the only way to explore them. Telerobotics also allows exploration of regions that are vulnerable to contamination by Earth micro-organisms since spacecraft can be sterilized. Humans can not be sterilized in the same way as a spaceship, as they coexist with numerous micro-organisms, and these micro-organisms are also hard to contain within a spaceship or spacesuit. Multiple space probes were sent to study Moon, the planets, the Sun, multiple small Solar System bodies (comets and asteroids).

Special class of uncrewed spacecraft is space telescopes, a telescope in outer space used to observe astronomical objects. The first operational telescopes were the American Orbiting Astronomical Observatory, OAO-2 launched in 1968, and the Soviet Orion 1 ultraviolet telescope aboard space station Salyut 1 in 1971. Space telescopes avoid the filtering and distortion (scintillation) of electromagnetic radiation which they observe, and avoid light pollution which ground-based observatories encounter. The best-known examples are Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope.

Cargo spacecraft are designed to carry cargo, possibly to support space stations&#x27; operation by transporting food, propellant and other supplies. Automated cargo spacecraft have been used since 1978 and have serviced Salyut 6, Salyut 7, Mir, the International Space Station and Tiangong space station.

=== Other ===
Some spacecrafts can operate as both a crewed and uncrewed spacecraft. For example, the Buran spaceplane could operate autonomously but also had manual controls, though it never flew with crew onboard.

Other dual crewed/uncrewed spacecrafts include: SpaceX Dragon 2, Dream Chaser, and Tianzhou.

== Types of spacecraft ==

=== Communications satellite ===
A communications satellite is an artificial satellite that relays and amplifies radio telecommunication signals via a transponder; it creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different locations on Earth. Communications satellites are used for television, telephone, radio, internet, and military applications. Many communications satellites are in geostationary orbit above the equator, so that the satellite appears stationary at the same point in the sky; therefore the satellite dish antennas of ground stations can be aimed permanently at that spot and do not have to move to track the satellite. Others form satellite constellations in low Earth orbit, where antennas on the ground have to follow the position of the satellites and switch between satellites frequently.

The high frequency radio waves used for telecommunications links travel by line of sight and so are obstructed by the curve of the Earth. The purpose of communications satellites is to relay the signal around the curve of the Earth allowing communication between widely separated geographical points. Communications satellites use a wide range of radio and microwave frequencies. To avoid signal interference, international organizations have regulations for which frequency ranges or &quot;bands&quot; certain organizations are allowed to use. This allocation of bands minimizes the risk of signal interference.

=== Cargo spacecraft ===
Cargo or resupply spacecraft are robotic spacecraft that are designed specifically to carry cargo, possibly to support space stations&#x27; operation by transporting food, propellant and other supplies.

Automated cargo spacecraft have been used since 1978 and have serviced Salyut 6, Salyut 7, Mir, the International Space Station and Tiangong space station.

As of 2023, three different cargo spacecraft are used to supply the International Space Station: Russian &quot;Progress&quot;, American SpaceX Dragon 2 and Cygnus. Chinese &quot;Tianzhou&quot; is used to supply Tiangong space station.

=== Space probes ===

Space probes are robotic spacecraft that are sent to explore deep space, or astronomical bodies other than Earth. They are distinguished from landers by the fact that they work in open space, not on planetary surfaces or in planetary atmospheres. Being robotic eliminates the need for expensive, heavy life support systems (the Apollo crewed Moon landings required the use of the Saturn V rocket that cost over a billion dollars per launch, adjusted for inflation) and so allows for lighter, less expensive rockets. Space probes have visited every planet in the Solar System and Pluto, and the Parker Solar Probe has an orbit that, at its closest point, is in the Sun&#x27;s chromosphere. There are five space probes that are escaping the Solar System, these are &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, &quot;Voyager 2&quot;, &quot;Pioneer 10&quot;, &quot;Pioneer 11&quot;, and &quot;New Horizons&quot;.

==== Voyager program ====

The identical Voyager probes, weighing , were launched in 1977 to take advantage of a rare alignment of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune that would allow a spacecraft to visit all four planets in one mission, and get to each destination faster by using gravity assist. In fact, the rocket that launched the probes (the Titan IIIE) could not even send the probes to the orbit of Saturn, yet &quot;Voyager 1&quot; is travelling at roughly and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; moves at about kilometres per second as of 2023. In 2012, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; exited the heliosphere, followed by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; in 2018. &quot;Voyager 1&quot; actually launched 16 days after &quot;Voyager 2&quot; but it reached Jupiter sooner because &quot;Voyager 2&quot; was taking a longer route that allowed it to visit Uranus and Neptune, whereas &quot;Voyager 1&quot; did not visit Uranus or Neptune, instead choosing to fly past Saturn’s satellite Titan. As of August 2023, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; has passed 160 astronomical units, which means it is over 160 times farther from the Sun than Earth is. This makes it the farthest spacecraft from the Sun. &quot;Voyager 2&quot; is 134 AU away from the Sun as of August 2023. NASA provides real time data of their distances and data from the probe’s cosmic ray detectors. Because of the probe’s declining power output and degradation of the RTGs over time, NASA has had to shut down certain instruments to conserve power. The probes may still have some scientific instruments on until the mid-2020s or perhaps the 2030s. After 2036, they will both be out of range of the Deep Space Network.

=== Space telescopes ===

A space telescope or space observatory is a telescope in outer space used to observe astronomical objects. Space telescopes avoid the filtering and distortion of electromagnetic radiation which they observe, and avoid light pollution which ground-based observatories encounter. They are divided into two types: satellites which map the entire sky (astronomical survey), and satellites which focus on selected astronomical objects or parts of the sky and beyond. Space telescopes are distinct from Earth imaging satellites, which point toward Earth for satellite imaging, applied for weather analysis, espionage, and other types of information gathering.

=== Landers ===
A lander is a type of spacecraft that makes a soft landing on the surface of an astronomical body other than Earth. Some landers, such as Philae and the Apollo Lunar Module, land entirely by using their fuel supply, however many landers (and landings of spacecraft on Earth) use aerobraking, especially for more distant destinations. This involves the spacecraft using a fuel burn to change its trajectory so it will pass through a planet (or a moon&#x27;s) atmosphere. Drag caused by the spacecraft hitting the atmosphere enables it to slow down without using fuel, however this generates very high temperatures and so adds a requirement for a heat shield of some sort.

=== Space capsules ===

Space capsules are a type of spacecraft that can return from space at least once. They have a blunt shape, do not usually contain much more fuel than needed, and they do not possess wings unlike spaceplanes. They are the simplest form of recoverable spacecraft, and so the most commonly used. The first such capsule was the Vostok capsule built by the Soviet Union, that carried the first person in space, Yuri Gagarin. Other examples include the Soyuz and Orion capsules, built by the Soviet Union and NASA, respectively.

=== Spaceplanes ===
Spaceplanes are spacecraft that are built in the shape of, and function as, airplanes. The first example of such was the North American X-15 spaceplane, which conducted two crewed flights which reached an altitude of over in the 1960s. This first reusable spacecraft was air-launched on a suborbital trajectory on July 19, 1963.

The first reusable orbital spaceplane was the Space Shuttle orbiter. The first orbiter to fly in space, the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;, was launched by the USA on the 20th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin&#x27;s flight, on April 12, 1981. During the Shuttle era, six orbiters were built, all of which have flown in the atmosphere and five of which have flown in space. &quot;Enterprise&quot; was used only for approach and landing tests, launching from the back of a Boeing 747 SCA and gliding to deadstick landings at Edwards AFB, California. The first Space Shuttle to fly into space was &quot;Columbia&quot;, followed by &quot;Challenger&quot;, &quot;Discovery&quot;, &quot;Atlantis&quot;, and &quot;Endeavour&quot;. &quot;Endeavour&quot; was built to replace &quot;Challenger&quot; when it was lost in January 1986. &quot;Columbia&quot; broke up during reentry in February 2003.

The first autonomous reusable spaceplane was the &quot;Buran&quot;-class shuttle, launched by the USSR on November 15, 1988, although it made only one flight and this was uncrewed. This spaceplane was designed for a crew and strongly resembled the U.S. Space Shuttle, although its drop-off boosters used liquid propellants and its main engines were located at the base of what would be the external tank in the American Shuttle. Lack of funding, complicated by the dissolution of the USSR, prevented any further flights of Buran. The Space Shuttle was subsequently modified to allow for autonomous re-entry in case of necessity.

Per the Vision for Space Exploration, the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011 mainly due to its old age and high cost of program reaching over a billion dollars per flight. The Shuttle&#x27;s human transport role is to be replaced by SpaceX&#x27;s SpaceX Dragon 2 and Boeing&#x27;s CST-100 Starliner. Dragon 2&#x27;s first crewed flight occurred on May 30, 2020. The Shuttle&#x27;s heavy cargo transport role is to be replaced by expendable rockets such as the Space Launch System and ULA&#x27;s Vulcan rocket, as well as the commercial launch vehicles.

Scaled Composites&#x27; SpaceShipOne was a reusable suborbital spaceplane that carried pilots Mike Melvill and Brian Binnie on consecutive flights in 2004 to win the Ansari X Prize. The Spaceship Company built a successor SpaceShipTwo. A fleet of SpaceShipTwos operated by Virgin Galactic was planned to begin reusable private spaceflight carrying paying passengers in 2014, but was delayed after the crash of VSS &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

==== Space Shuttle ====
The Space Shuttle is a retired reusable Low Earth Orbital launch system. It consisted of two reusable Solid Rocket Boosters that landed by parachute, were recovered at sea, and were the most powerful rocket motors ever made until they were superseded by those of NASA’s SLS rocket, with a liftoff thrust of , which soon increased to per booster, and were fueled by a combination of PBAN and APCP, the Space Shuttle Orbiter, with 3 RS-25 engines that used a liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen propellant combination, and the bright orange throwaway Space Shuttle external tank from which the RS-25 engines sourced their fuel. The orbiter was a spaceplane that was launched at NASA’s Kennedy Space Centre and landed mainly at the Shuttle Landing Facility, which is part of Kennedy Space Centre. A second launch site, Vandenberg Space Launch Complex 6 in California, was revamped so it could be used to launch the shuttles, but it was never used. The launch system could lift about into an eastward Low Earth Orbit. Each orbiter weighed roughly , however the different orbiters had differing weights and thus payloads, with &quot;Columbia&quot; being the heaviest orbiter, &quot;Challenger&quot; being lighter than &quot;Columbia but&quot; still heavier than the other three. The orbiter structure was mostly composed of aluminium alloy. The orbiter had seven seats for crew members, though on STS-61-A the launch took place with 8 crew onboard. The orbiters had wide by long payload bays and also were equipped with a CanadaArm1, an upgraded version of which is used on the International Space Station. The heat shield (or Thermal Protection System) of the orbiter, used to protect it from extreme levels of heat during atmospheric reentry and the cold of space, was made up of different materials depending on weight and how much heating a particular area on the shuttle would receive during reentry, which ranged from over to under . The orbiter was manually operated, though an autonomous landing system was added while the shuttle was still on service. It had an in orbit maneouvreing system known as the Orbital Manoeuvring System, which used the hypergolic propellants monomethylhydrazine (MMH) and dinitrogen tetroxide, which was used for orbital insertion, changes to orbits and the deorbit burn.
Though the shuttle’s goals were to drastically decrease launch costs, it did not do so, ending up being much more expensive than similar expendable launchers. This was due to expensive refurbishment costs and the external tank being expended. Once a landing had occurred, the SRBs and many parts of the orbiter had to be disassembled for inspection, which was long and arduous. Furthermore, the RS-25 engines had to be replaced every few flights. Each of the heat shielding tiles had to go in one specific area on the orbiter, increasing complexity more. Adding to this, the shuttle was a rather dangerous system, with fragile heat shielding tiles, some being so fragile that one could easily scrape it off by hand, often having been damaged in many flights. After 30 years in service from 1981 to 2011 and 135 flights, the shuttle was retired from service due to the cost of maintaining the shuttles, and the 3 remaining orbiters (the other two were destroyed in accidents) were prepared to be displayed in museums.

=== Other ===
Some spacecraft do not fit particularly well into any of the general spacecraft categories. This is a list of these spacecraft.

==== SpaceX Starship ====

Starship is a spacecraft and second stage under development by American aerospace company SpaceX. Stacked atop its booster, Super Heavy, it composes the identically named Starship super heavy-lift space vehicle. The spacecraft is designed to transport both crew and cargo to a variety of destinations, including Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and potentially beyond. It is intended to enable long duration interplanetary flights for a crew of up to 100 people. It will also be capable of point-to-point transport on Earth, enabling travel to anywhere in the world in less than an hour. Furthermore, the spacecraft will be used to refuel other Starship vehicles to allow them to reach higher orbits to and other space destinations. Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX, estimated in a tweet that 8 launches would be needed to completely refuel a Starship in low Earth orbit, extrapolating this from Starship&#x27;s payload to orbit and how much fuel a fully fueled Starship contains. To land on bodies without an atmosphere, such as the Moon, Starship will fire its engines and thrusters to slow down.

==== Mission Extension Vehicle ====

The Mission Extension Vehicle is a robotic spacecraft designed to prolong the life on another spacecraft. It works by docking to its target spacecraft, then correcting its orientation or orbit. This also allows it to rescue a satellite which is in the wrong orbit by using its own fuel to move its target to the correct orbit. The project is currently managed by Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems. As of 2023, 2 have been launched. The first launched on a Proton rocket on 9 October 2019, and did a rendezvous with Intelsat-901 on 25 February 2020. It will remain with the satellite until 2025 before the satellite is moved to a final graveyard orbit and the vehicle does a rendezvous with another satellite. The other one launched on an Ariane 5 rocket on 15 August 2020.

== Subsystems ==

A spacecraft astrionics system comprises different subsystems, depending on the mission profile. Spacecraft subsystems are mounted in the satellite bus and may include attitude determination and control (variously called ADAC, ADC, or ACS), guidance, navigation and control (GNC or GN&amp;C), communications (comms), command and data handling (CDH or C&amp;DH), power (EPS), thermal control (TCS), propulsion, and structures. Attached to the bus are typically payloads.

; Life support
: Spacecraft intended for human spaceflight must also include a life support system for the crew.

; Attitude control
: A spacecraft needs an attitude control subsystem to be correctly oriented in space and respond to external torques and forces properly. This may use reaction wheels or it may use small rocket thrusters. The altitude control subsystem consists of sensors and actuators, together with controlling algorithms. The attitude-control subsystem permits proper pointing for the science objective, sun pointing for power to the solar arrays and earth pointing for communications.

; GNC
: Guidance refers to the calculation of the commands (usually done by the CDH subsystem) needed to steer the spacecraft where it is desired to be. Navigation means determining a spacecraft&#x27;s orbital elements or position. Control means adjusting the path of the spacecraft to meet mission requirements.

; Command and data handling
: The C&amp;DH subsystem receives commands from the communications subsystem, performs validation and decoding of the commands, and distributes the commands to the appropriate spacecraft subsystems and components. The CDH also receives housekeeping data and science data from the other spacecraft subsystems and components, and packages the data for storage on a data recorder or transmission to the ground via the communications subsystem. Other functions of the CDH include maintaining the spacecraft clock and state-of-health monitoring.
; Communications
: Spacecraft, both robotic and crewed, have various communications systems for communication with terrestrial stations and for inter-satellite service. Technologies include space radio station and optical communication. In addition, some spacecraft payloads are explicitly for the purpose of ground–ground communication using receiver/retransmitter electronic technologies.

; Power
: Spacecraft need an electrical power generation and distribution subsystem for powering the various spacecraft subsystems. For spacecraft near the Sun, solar panels are frequently used to generate electrical power. Spacecraft designed to operate in more distant locations, for example Jupiter, might employ a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) to generate electrical power. Electrical power is sent through power conditioning equipment before it passes through a power distribution unit over an electrical bus to other spacecraft components. Batteries are typically connected to the bus via a battery charge regulator, and the batteries are used to provide electrical power during periods when primary power is not available, for example when a low Earth orbit spacecraft is eclipsed by Earth.

; Thermal control
: Spacecraft must be engineered to withstand transit through Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and the space environment. They must operate in a vacuum with temperatures potentially ranging across hundreds of degrees Celsius as well as (if subject to reentry) in the presence of plasmas. Material requirements are such that either high melting temperature, low density materials such as beryllium and reinforced carbon–carbon or (possibly due to the lower thickness requirements despite its high density) tungsten or ablative carbon–carbon composites are used. Depending on mission profile, spacecraft may also need to operate on the surface of another planetary body. The thermal control subsystem can be passive, dependent on the selection of materials with specific radiative properties. Active thermal control makes use of electrical heaters and certain actuators such as louvers to control temperature ranges of equipments within specific ranges.

; Spacecraft propulsion
: Spacecraft may or may not have a propulsion subsystem, depending on whether or not the mission profile calls for propulsion. The &quot;Swift&quot; spacecraft is an example of a spacecraft that does not have a propulsion subsystem. Typically though, LEO spacecraft include a propulsion subsystem for altitude adjustments (drag make-up maneuvers) and inclination adjustment maneuvers. A propulsion system is also needed for spacecraft that perform momentum management maneuvers. Components of a conventional propulsion subsystem include fuel, tankage, valves, pipes, and thrusters. The thermal control system interfaces with the propulsion subsystem by monitoring the temperature of those components, and by preheating tanks and thrusters in preparation for a spacecraft maneuver.

; Structures
: Spacecraft must be engineered to withstand launch loads imparted by the launch vehicle, and must have a point of attachment for all the other subsystems. Depending on mission profile, the structural subsystem might need to withstand loads imparted by entry into the atmosphere of another planetary body, and landing on the surface of another planetary body.

; Payload
: The payload depends on the mission of the spacecraft, and is typically regarded as the part of the spacecraft &quot;that pays the bills&quot;. Typical payloads could include scientific instruments (cameras, telescopes, or particle detectors, for example), cargo, or a human crew.

; Ground segment

: The ground segment, though not technically part of the spacecraft, is vital to the operation of the spacecraft. Typical components of a ground segment in use during normal operations include a mission operations facility where the flight operations team conducts the operations of the spacecraft, a data processing and storage facility, ground stations to radiate signals to and receive signals from the spacecraft, and a voice and data communications network to connect all mission elements.

; Launch vehicle
: The launch vehicle propels the spacecraft from Earth&#x27;s surface, through the atmosphere, and into an orbit, the exact orbit being dependent on the mission configuration. The launch vehicle may be expendable or reusable. In a single stage to orbit rocket, the rocket can be considered a spacecraft itself.

<doc id="37913" wikidata="Q166530" url="?curid=37913" title="Escape velocity">
<text>In celestial mechanics, escape velocity or escape speed is the minimum speed needed for an object to escape from contact with or orbit of a primary body, assuming:
* Ballistic trajectory – no other forces are acting on the object, such as propulsion and friction
* No other gravity-producing objects exist.

Although the term &quot;escape velocity&quot; is common, it is more accurately described as a speed than as a velocity because it is independent of direction. Because gravitational force between two objects depends on their combined mass, the escape speed also depends on mass. For artificial satellites and small natural objects, the mass of the object makes a negligible contribution to the combined mass, and so is often ignored.

Escape speed varies with distance from the center of the primary body, as does the velocity of an object traveling under the gravitational influence of the primary. If an object is in a circular or elliptical orbit, its speed is always less than the escape speed at its current distance. In contrast if it is on a hyperbolic trajectory its speed will always be higher than the escape speed at its current distance. (It will slow down as it gets to greater distance, but do so asymptotically approaching a positive speed.) An object on a parabolic trajectory will always be traveling exactly the escape speed at its current distance. It has precisely balanced positive kinetic energy and negative gravitational potential energy; it will always be slowing down, asymptotically approaching zero speed, but never quite stop.

Escape velocity calculations are typically used to determine whether an object will remain in the gravitational sphere of influence of a given body. For example, in solar system exploration it is useful to know whether a probe will continue to orbit the Earth or escape to a heliocentric orbit. It is also useful to know how much a probe will need to slow down in order to be gravitationally captured by its destination body. Rockets do not have to reach escape velocity in a single maneuver, and objects can also use a gravity assist to siphon kinetic energy away from large bodies. 

Precise trajectory calculations require taking into account small forces like atmospheric drag, radiation pressure, and solar wind. A rocket under continuous or intermittent thrust (or an object climbing a space elevator) can attain escape at any non-zero speed, but the minimum amount of energy required to do so is always the same.

== Calculation ==
Escape speed at a distance &quot;d&quot; from the center of a spherically symmetric primary body (such as a star or a planet) with mass &quot;M&quot; is given by the formula
: formula_1
where:
* &quot;G&quot; is the universal gravitational constant ()
* &quot;g&quot; = &quot;GM&quot;/&quot;d&quot;2 is the local gravitational acceleration (or the surface gravity, when ).

The value &quot;GM&quot; is called the standard gravitational parameter, or &quot;μ&quot;, and is often known more accurately than either &quot;G&quot; or &quot;M&quot; separately.

When given an initial speed &quot;V&quot; greater than the escape speed &quot;v&quot;, the object will asymptotically approach the &quot;hyperbolic excess speed&quot; &quot;v&quot;, satisfying the equation:
: formula_2

For example, with the definitional value for standard gravity of , the escape velocity from Earth is . 

=== Energy required ===
For an object of mass formula_3 the energy required to escape the Earth&#x27;s gravitational field is &quot;GMm&quot; / &quot;r&quot;, a function of the object&#x27;s mass (where &quot;r&quot; is radius of the Earth, nominally 6,371 kilometres (3,959 mi), &quot;G&quot; is the gravitational constant, and &quot;M&quot; is the mass of the Earth, ). A related quantity is the specific orbital energy which is essentially the sum of the kinetic and potential energy divided by the mass. An object has reached escape velocity when the specific orbital energy is greater than or equal to zero.

=== Conservation of energy ===
The existence of escape velocity can be thought of as a consequence of conservation of energy and an energy field of finite depth. For an object with a given total energy, which is moving subject to conservative forces (such as a static gravity field) it is only possible for the object to reach combinations of locations and speeds which have that total energy; places which have a higher potential energy than this cannot be reached at all. Adding speed (kinetic energy) to an object expands the region of locations it can reach, until, with enough energy, everywhere to infinity becomes accessible.

The formula for escape velocity can be derived from the principle of conservation of energy. For the sake of simplicity, unless stated otherwise, we assume that an object will escape the gravitational field of a uniform spherical planet by moving away from it and that the only significant force acting on the moving object is the planet&#x27;s gravity. Imagine that a spaceship of mass &quot;m&quot; is initially at a distance &quot;r&quot; from the center of mass of the planet, whose mass is &quot;M&quot;, and its initial speed is equal to its escape velocity, &quot;v&quot;. At its final state, it will be an infinite distance away from the planet, and its speed will be negligibly small. Kinetic energy &quot;K&quot; and gravitational potential energy &quot;U&quot;g are the only types of energy that we will deal with (we will ignore the drag of the atmosphere), so by the conservation of energy,
: formula_4

We can set &quot;K&quot;final = 0 because final velocity is arbitrarily small, and = 0 because final gravitational potential energy is defined to be zero a long distance away from a planet, so
: formula_5

=== Relativistic ===
The same result is obtained by a relativistic calculation, in which case the variable &quot;r&quot; represents the &quot;radial coordinate&quot; or &quot;reduced circumference&quot; of the Schwarzschild metric.

== Scenarios ==

=== From the surface of a body ===
An alternative expression for the escape velocity &quot;v&quot; particularly useful at the surface on the body is:
: formula_6
where &quot;r&quot; is the distance between the center of the body and the point at which escape velocity is being calculated and &quot;g&quot; is the gravitational acceleration at that distance (i.e., the surface gravity).

For a body with a spherically symmetric distribution of mass, the escape velocity &quot;v&quot; from the surface is proportional to the radius assuming constant density, and proportional to the square root of the average density &quot;ρ&quot;.
: formula_7
where formula_8.

This escape velocity is relative to a non-rotating frame of reference, not relative to the moving surface of the planet or moon, as explained below.

=== From a rotating body ===
The escape velocity &quot;relative to the surface&quot; of a rotating body depends on direction in which the escaping body travels. For example, as the Earth&#x27;s rotational velocity is 465 m/s at the equator, a rocket launched tangentially from the Earth&#x27;s equator to the east requires an initial velocity of about 10.735 km/s &quot;relative to the moving surface at the point of launch&quot; to escape whereas a rocket launched tangentially from the Earth&#x27;s equator to the west requires an initial velocity of about 11.665 km/s &quot;relative to that moving surface&quot;. The surface velocity decreases with the cosine of the geographic latitude, so space launch facilities are often located as close to the equator as feasible, e.g. the American Cape Canaveral (latitude 28°28′ N) and the French Guiana Space Centre (latitude 5°14′ N).

=== Practical considerations ===
In most situations it is impractical to achieve escape velocity almost instantly, because of the acceleration implied, and also because if there is an atmosphere, the hypersonic speeds involved (on Earth a speed of 11.2 km/s, or 40,320 km/h) would cause most objects to burn up due to aerodynamic heating or be torn apart by atmospheric drag. For an actual escape orbit, a spacecraft will accelerate steadily out of the atmosphere until it reaches the escape velocity appropriate for its altitude (which will be less than on the surface). In many cases, the spacecraft may be first placed in a parking orbit (e.g. a low Earth orbit at 160–2,000 km) and then accelerated to the escape velocity at that altitude, which will be slightly lower (about 11.0 km/s at a low Earth orbit of 200 km). The required additional change in speed, however, is far less because the spacecraft already has a significant orbital speed (in low Earth orbit speed is approximately 7.8 km/s, or 28,080 km/h).

=== From an orbiting body ===
The escape velocity at a given height is formula_9 times the speed in a circular orbit at the same height, (compare this with the velocity equation in circular orbit). This corresponds to the fact that the potential energy with respect to infinity of an object in such an orbit is minus two times its kinetic energy, while to escape the sum of potential and kinetic energy needs to be at least zero. The velocity corresponding to the circular orbit is sometimes called the first cosmic velocity, whereas in this context the escape velocity is referred to as the second cosmic velocity.

For a body in an elliptical orbit wishing to accelerate to an escape orbit the required speed will vary, and will be greatest at periapsis when the body is closest to the central body. However, the orbital speed of the body will also be at its highest at this point, and the change in velocity required will be at its lowest, as explained by the Oberth effect.

=== Barycentric escape velocity ===
Escape velocity can either be measured as relative to the other, central body or relative to center of mass or barycenter of the system of bodies. Thus for systems of two bodies, the term &quot;escape velocity&quot; can be ambiguous, but it is usually intended to mean the barycentric escape velocity of the less massive body. Escape velocity usually refers to the escape velocity of zero mass test particles. For zero mass test particles we have that the &#x27;relative to the other&#x27; and the &#x27;barycentric&#x27; escape velocities are the same, namely formula_10.

But when we can&#x27;t neglect the smaller mass (say &quot;m&quot;) we arrive at slightly different formulas.

Because the system has to obey the law of conservation of momentum we see that both the larger and the smaller mass must be accelerated in the gravitational field. Relative to the center of mass the velocity of the larger mass (&quot;v&quot;, for planet) can be expressed in terms of the velocity of the smaller mass (&quot;v&quot;, for rocket). We get formula_11.

The &#x27;barycentric&#x27; escape velocity now becomes formula_12, while the &#x27;relative to the other&#x27; escape velocity becomes formula_13.

=== Height of lower-velocity trajectories ===
Ignoring all factors other than the gravitational force between the body and the object, an object projected vertically at speed &quot;v&quot; from the surface of a spherical body with escape velocity &quot;v&quot; and radius &quot;R&quot; will attain a maximum height &quot;h&quot; satisfying the equation
: formula_14
which, solving for &quot;h&quot; results in
: formula_15
where is the ratio of the original speed &quot;v&quot; to the escape velocity &quot;v&quot;.

Unlike escape velocity, the direction (vertically up) is important to achieve maximum height.

== Trajectory ==
If an object attains exactly escape velocity, but is not directed straight away from the planet, then it will follow a curved path or trajectory. Although this trajectory does not form a closed shape, it can be referred to as an orbit. Assuming that gravity is the only significant force in the system, this object&#x27;s speed at any point in the trajectory will be equal to the escape velocity &quot;at that point&quot; due to the conservation of energy, its total energy must always be 0, which implies that it always has escape velocity; see the derivation above. The shape of the trajectory will be a parabola whose focus is located at the center of mass of the planet. An actual escape requires a course with a trajectory that does not intersect with the planet, or its atmosphere, since this would cause the object to crash. When moving away from the source, this path is called an escape orbit. Escape orbits are known as orbits. &quot;C&quot; is the characteristic energy, −&quot;GM&quot;/2&quot;a&quot;, where &quot;a&quot; is the semi-major axis length, which is infinite for parabolic trajectories.

If the body has a velocity greater than escape velocity then its path will form a hyperbolic trajectory and it will have an excess hyperbolic velocity, equivalent to the extra energy the body has. A relatively small extra delta-&quot;v&quot; above that needed to accelerate to the escape speed can result in a relatively large speed at infinity. Some orbital manoeuvres make use of this fact. For example, at a place where escape speed is 11.2 km/s, the addition of 0.4 km/s yields a hyperbolic excess speed of 3.02 km/s:
: formula_16

If a body in circular orbit (or at the periapsis of an elliptical orbit) accelerates along its direction of travel to escape velocity, the point of acceleration will form the periapsis of the escape trajectory. The eventual direction of travel will be at 90 degrees to the direction at the point of acceleration. If the body accelerates to beyond escape velocity the eventual direction of travel will be at a smaller angle, and indicated by one of the asymptotes of the hyperbolic trajectory it is now taking. This means the timing of the acceleration is critical if the intention is to escape in a particular direction.

If the speed at periapsis is , then the eccentricity of the trajectory is given by:
: formula_17
This is valid for elliptical, parabolic, and hyperbolic trajectories. If the trajectory is hyperbolic or parabolic, it will asymptotically approach an angle formula_18 from the direction at periapsis, with
: formula_19
The speed will asymptotically approach
: formula_20

== List of escape velocities ==
In this table, the left-hand half gives the escape velocity from the visible surface (which may be gaseous as with Jupiter for example), relative to the centre of the planet or moon (that is, not relative to its moving surface). In the right-hand half, &quot;V&quot;e refers to the speed relative to the central body (for example the sun), whereas &quot;V&quot;te is the speed (at the visible surface of the smaller body) relative to the smaller body (planet or moon).
The last two columns will depend precisely where in orbit escape velocity is reached, as the orbits are not exactly circular (particularly Mercury and Pluto).

== Deriving escape velocity using calculus ==
Let &quot;G&quot; be the gravitational constant and let &quot;M&quot; be the mass of the earth (or other gravitating body) and &quot;m&quot; be the mass of the escaping body or projectile. At a distance &quot;r&quot; from the centre of gravitation the body feels an attractive force
: formula_21
The work needed to move the body over a small distance &quot;dr&quot; against this force is therefore given by
: formula_22
The total work needed to move the body from the surface &quot;r&quot;0 of the gravitating body to infinity is then
: formula_23
In order to do this work to reach infinity, the body&#x27;s minimal kinetic energy at departure must match this work, so the escape velocity &quot;v&quot;0 satisfies
: formula_24
which results in
: formula_25
