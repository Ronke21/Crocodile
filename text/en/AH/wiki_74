<text>Todd Harry Rundgren (born June 22, 1948) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer who has performed a diverse range of styles as a solo artist and as a member of the bands Nazz and Utopia. He is known for his sophisticated and often unorthodox music, his occasionally lavish stage shows, and his later experiments with interactive art. He also produced music videos and was an early adopter and promoter of various computer technologies, such as using the Internet as a means of music distribution in the late 1990s.

A native of Philadelphia, Rundgren began his professional career in the mid-1960s, forming the psychedelic band Nazz in 1967. After two years, he left Nazz to pursue a solo career and immediately scored his first US top 40 hit with &quot;We Gotta Get You a Woman&quot; (1970). His best-known songs include &quot;Hello It&#x27;s Me&quot; and &quot;I Saw the Light&quot; from &quot;Something/Anything?&quot; (1972), which get frequent air time on classic rock radio stations, the 1978 &quot;Can We Still Be Friends&quot;, and the 1983 single &quot;Bang the Drum All Day&quot;, which is featured in many sports arenas, commercials, and movie trailers. Although lesser known, &quot;Couldn&#x27;t I Just Tell You&quot; (1972) was influential to many artists in the power pop genre. His 1973 album &quot;A Wizard, a True Star&quot; remains an influence on later generations of bedroom musicians.

Rundgren is considered a pioneer in the fields of electronic music, progressive rock, music videos, computer software, and Internet music delivery. He organized the first interactive television concert in 1978, designed the first color graphics tablet in 1980, and created the first interactive album, &quot;No World Order&quot;, in 1994. Additionally, he was one of the first acts to be prominent as both an artist and producer. His notable production credits include Badfinger&#x27;s &quot;Straight Up&quot; (1971), Grand Funk Railroad&#x27;s &quot;We&#x27;re an American Band&quot; (1973), the New York Dolls&#x27; &quot;New York Dolls&quot; (1973), Meat Loaf&#x27;s &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; (1977), and XTC&#x27;s &quot;Skylarking&quot; (1986). He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2021.

==Early influences and Nazz==

Todd Harry Rundgren was born in Philadelphia on June 22, 1948, the son of Ruth (née Fleck; April 29, 1922 – April 6, 2016) and Harry W. Rundgren (1917–1996). His father was of Swedish descent and his mother was of Austrian and German descent. He grew up in the bordering town of Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania and taught himself how to play guitar with little help. As a child, Rundgren was fascinated by his parents&#x27; small record collection, which consisted of show tunes and symphonic pieces, and especially by the operettas of Gilbert and Sullivan. Later, he grew infatuated with the music of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Ventures, and the Yardbirds, as well as the Philadelphia soul of Gamble &amp; Huff, the Delfonics, and the O&#x27;Jays. At the age of 17, he formed his first band, Money, with then-best friend and roommate Randy Reed and Reed&#x27;s younger brother.

After graduating from Upper Darby High School in 1966, Rundgren moved to Philadelphia and began his career in Woody&#x27;s Truck Stop, a blues rock group in the style of Paul Butterfield Blues Band. Rundgren stayed with the band for eight months, and in the process, they became the most popular group in Philadelphia. He and bassist Carson Van Osten left before they released the eponymous first album to form the rock band Nazz in 1967. By then, Rundgren had lost interest in the blues and wanted to pursue a recording career with original songs in the style of newer records by the Beatles and the Who. As a member of the Nazz, he learned his craft as a songwriter and vocal arranger, and was determined to equal the artistry of the Beatles.

In 1968, after recording four demo discs, the Nazz were signed by Atlantic Records subsidiary Screen Gems Columbia (SGC). They were flown to Los Angeles to produce their first album at ID Sound studio. Rundgren had no prior production experience and remembered that the producer, Bill Traut, &quot;just whipped through the mixes in a day or two ... So I got it into my head, &#x27;Well, he&#x27;s gone now, so why don&#x27;t we just mix it again, more like the way we want it?&#x27; Our engineer didn&#x27;t mind if we went and just started diddling around on the board ... It was pretty much trial and error.&quot; He took an experimental approach to the recordings, employing techniques such as varispeed and flanging, and despite having no formal training, scored music charts for string and horn arrangements. Engineer James Lowe, who Rundgren recruited for his involvement with arranger Van Dyke Parks, believed that Rundgren had become the de facto leader of Nazz, and that a producer&#x27;s credit was wrongfully withheld from him.

Nazz gained minor recognition with their debut single, July 1968&#x27;s &quot;Open My Eyes&quot; backed with &quot;Hello It&#x27;s Me&quot;, both songs penned by Rundgren. They subsequently released three albums: &quot;Nazz&quot; (October 1968), &quot;Nazz Nazz&quot; (April 1969), and &quot;Nazz III&quot; (1971). In March 1968, New York singer-songwriter Laura Nyro released her second album, &quot;Eli and the Thirteenth Confession&quot;. When Rundgren heard the record, he was struck by &quot;all the major seventh chords and variations on augmented and suspended chords&quot;, and it had an immediate impact on his songwriting, especially as he began to compose more on piano. He elaborated:

The rest of the band struggled to accommodate his changing tastes, and tensions between all the band members had begun to build up in the interval between recording their first and second albums as a result of their shared living quarters. Tensions further increased during the recording of Nazz&#x27;s second album, as the other members bridled at the formerly unassuming Rundgren asserting complete control of the sessions as the producer. By the time &quot;Nazz Nazz&quot; was released, Rundgren and Van Osten had both left the Nazz, so the track selection was done without any input from them. &quot;Nazz III&quot;, which included leftover tracks from the &quot;Nazz Nazz&quot; sessions, was likewise released without Rundgren&#x27;s involvement.

==Production beginnings==

After departing Nazz, the 21-year-old Rundgren briefly considered working as a computer programmer, and then decided that his calling was as a producer. He moved to New York in the summer of 1969 and involved himself with the clubs of Greenwich Village, particularly Steve Paul&#x27;s Scene, and met a number of Manhattan musicians and fashion designers. Michael Friedman, formerly the assistant of Nazz manager John Kurland, offered Rundgren a job as staff engineer and producer under Albert Grossman, which Rundgren accepted. Grossman, known for his management of folk rock acts, had just founded Ampex Records, a joint business venture with the tape company of the same name, and built Bearsville Studios, near Woodstock. Bearsville soon became its own record imprint. Grossman promised to Rundgren that he would become the &quot;highest-paid producer in the world&quot;, which later came true.

Rundgren said he was initially relegated to &quot;various old folk artists that they had who needed an upgrade: people like Ian &amp; Sylvia, James Cotton, and other artists in Albert&#x27;s stable.&quot; Shortly after producing the eponymous 1969 album by Great Speckled Bird, he was promoted as Bearsville&#x27;s house engineer. Accompanied by Robbie Robertson and Levon Helm of the Band, he traveled to Canada to record Jesse Winchester&#x27;s eponymous 1970 debut album. Immediately afterward, he said, &quot;the Band asked me to engineer their &quot;Stage Fright&quot; sessions. I think &quot;Jesse Winchester&quot; was a kind of run-through for that, because I was pretty quick to get the sounds and they liked that.&quot; Released in August 1970, &quot;Stage Fright&quot; reached number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the highest chart showing the Band had to that point. Rundgren was dubbed Bearsville&#x27;s &quot;boy wonder&quot;.

His work for the Band was followed by a second album for Winchester (which was then shelved for two years) and the album &quot;Taking Care of Business&quot; by the James Cotton Blues Band (1970). This project resulted in Rundgren meeting Cotton&#x27;s keyboard player Mark &quot;Moogy&quot; Klingman, who in turn introduced Rundgren to keyboard player Ralph Schuckett, both of whom worked extensively with Rundgren over the next few years. Rundgren was to produce Janis Joplin&#x27;s third and ultimately final album, &quot;Pearl&quot; (1971), but plans fell through, as the two artists could not get along with each other.

==Solo career==
===1970–1984: Bearsville era===
====&quot;Runt&quot; and &quot;Ballad of Todd Rundgren&quot;====

Following a period where he thought he would never return to being a performing artist, Rundgren approached Grossman with the idea of what would become his debut solo record, &quot;Runt&quot;. Although his general attitude for any project was to &quot;make the record [I] wanted to make and then hope the label can find a way to promote it&quot;, Rundgren ensured that any loss to Grossman would be minimal: &quot;I didn&#x27;t get an actual advance for &quot;Runt&quot;. I just asked for a recording budget to pay the studio costs. ... I had no idea how much money I even had in the bank. If I needed cash, I would show up at the accountants and they would just give me hundreds or thousands of dollars.&quot;

Released in mid-1970, &quot;Runt&quot; was not originally credited to Rundgren due to his anxieties about starting a full-fledged solo career, and instead bore the moniker &quot;Runt&quot;. The album featured a bright sound and songs inspired by Laura Nyro. It was recorded with the 17-year-old bassist Tony Fox Sales and his 14-year-old brother Hunt Sales on drums. &quot;Nazz&quot; engineer James Lowe returned for the sessions and recalled that Rundgren seemed &quot;more able to really lead a group. If you go back and listen to it, it&#x27;s very sophisticated material, especially for a guy so young.&quot; Lead single &quot;We Gotta Get You a Woman&quot; reached number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. As he prepared a follow-up LP, he produced &quot;Halfnelson&quot;, the debut album by the band that would later become Sparks. Members Ron and Russell Mael later credited Rundgren with launching Sparks&#x27; career.

Rundgren&#x27;s industry reputation grew substantially as a result of his success with &quot;Runt&quot;, and for the first time in his life, he began using recreational drugs. Initially this was limited to marijuana. He said that the drug gave him &quot;a whole different sensibility about time and space and order&quot; that influenced the writing for his second album, &quot;Runt. The Ballad of Todd Rundgren&quot;. The material was mostly piano ballads and still largely based on Nyro&#x27;s template, but a more conscious effort by Rundgren was made to refine his music and choice of subject matter, and to distinguish himself from his influences. Released June 1971, &quot;The Ballad of Todd Rundgren&quot; bore two singles, &quot;Be Nice to Me&quot; and &quot;A Long Time, a Long Way To Go&quot;, neither of which repeated the success of &quot;We Gotta Get You a Woman&quot;. While initial reviews of &quot;Ballad&quot; were mixed, it came to be regarded as one of the greatest singer-songwriter albums of the era.

====&quot;Something/Anything?&quot;====
In late 1971, Rundgren was recruited to finish Badfinger&#x27;s third album &quot;Straight Up&quot;, a project George Harrison had abandoned to organize the Concert for Bangladesh, in London. The album was a hit and its two singles were similarly successful, although Rundgren was not credited for the first (&quot;Day After Day&quot;) and thus did not receive production royalties for that single. Rundgren said that the song &quot;didn&#x27;t sound much like what [Harrison had] done&quot; and speculated that the credit to Harrison &quot;may or may not have been something purposeful, just some by-product of a general Beatle hubris&quot;. The &quot;Straight Up&quot; sessions lasted two weeks in September, after which Rundgren returned to Los Angeles to work on his third solo album, originally planned as a single LP.

As with &quot;Ballad&quot;, much of the newer material was written or conceived under the influence of marijuana. However, by this time, he had also begun experimenting with Ritalin. He recalled, &quot;my songwriting process had become almost too second-nature. I was writing songs formulaically, almost without thinking, knocking [them out], reflexively, in about 20 minutes.&quot; The use of Ritalin also helped him focus on the process as he worked up to 12 hours a day to beat the three-week deadline. To keep up the pace, he installed an eight-track recorder, mixer, and synthesizers into his living room so that he could continue recording after leaving the studio. For the first time in his career, Rundgren recorded every part by himself, including bass, drums, and vocals. About &quot;an album and a half&quot; was completed this way. He then decided to stretch the project into a double LP and quickly recorded the last few tracks with musicians, live in the studio.

&quot;Something/Anything?&quot;, the first album officially issued under the name &quot;Todd Rundgren&quot;, was released in February 1972, shortly after Bearsville had signed a long-term distribution deal with Warner Bros. Records. The album included many songs that would become his best-known. Included among straightforward pop songs are extended jams and studio banter, such as the spoken-word track &quot;Intro&quot;, in which he teaches the listener about recording flaws for an egg hunt-type game he calls &quot;Sounds of the Studio&quot;. Magazine ads depicted a smiling Rundgren daring the reader to &quot;ignore me&quot;. The album peaked at number 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified gold in three years. Lead single &quot;I Saw the Light&quot; peaked at number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Hello It&#x27;s Me&quot;, which followed late in 1973, reached number 5.

According to music critic Colin Larkin, &quot;Something/Anything?&quot; has since been &quot;rightly regarded as one of the landmark releases of the early 70s&quot;. &quot;Couldn&#x27;t I Just Tell You&quot; was influential to artists in the power pop genre. Music journalist Paul Lester called the recording a &quot;masterclass in compression&quot; and said that Rundgren &quot;staked his claim to powerpop immortality [and] set the whole ball rolling&quot;. Musician Scott Miller&#x27;s 2010 book &quot;&quot; calls the song &quot;likely the greatest power pop recording ever made,&quot; with lyrics &quot;somehow both desperate and lighthearted at the same time,&quot; and a guitar solo having &quot;truly amazing dexterity and inflection&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Something/Anything?&quot; was ranked number 173 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

====&quot;A Wizard, a True Star&quot;, &quot;Todd&quot;, and Utopia====
Subsequent albums, beginning with &quot;A Wizard, a True Star&quot; and the spin-off group Utopia, saw a dramatic shift away from straightforward three-minute pop. After the success of &quot;Something/Anything?&quot;, Rundgren felt uncomfortable that he was being increasingly tagged as &quot;the male Carole King&quot;. &quot;With all due respect to Carole King,&quot; he said, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t what I was hoping to create as a musical legacy for myself.&quot; Now relocated back to New York and experimenting with a host of psychedelic drugs, he began to think that the writing on &quot;Something/Anything?&quot; was largely formulaic and borne from laziness, and sought to create a &quot;more eclectic and more experimental&quot; follow-up album. His music tastes also started to lean toward the progressive rock of Frank Zappa, Yes, and the Mahavishnu Orchestra. In 2017, while giving a commencement speech at the Berklee College of Music, he described the record as:

The sound and structure of &quot;Wizard&quot; was heavily informed by Rundgren&#x27;s hallucinogenic experiences. It was envisioned as a hallucinogenic-inspired &quot;flight plan&quot; with all the tracks segueing seamlessly into each other, starting with a &quot;chaotic&quot; mood and ending with a medley of his favorite soul songs. He said: &quot;With drugs I could suddenly abstract my thought processes in a certain way, and I wanted to see if I could put them on a record. A lot of people recognized it as the dynamics of a psychedelic trip—it was almost like painting with your head.&quot; Rundgren and Moogy Klingman established a professional recording studio, Secret Sound, to accommodate the &quot;Wizard&quot; sessions. The studio was designed to Rundgren&#x27;s specifications and was created so that he could freely indulge in sound experimentation without having to worry about hourly studio costs, although he maintained that the album still felt &quot;kind of rushed through because the studio wasn&#x27;t finished&quot;. Some of the other influences on the album included musical theater, jazz, and funk.

&quot;A Wizard, a True Star&quot; was released in March 1973. At Rundgren&#x27;s behest, no singles were issued from the album, as he wanted the tracks to be heard in the context of the LP. Its release coincided with the success of the &quot;Hello It&#x27;s Me&quot; single, which gave Rundgren a reputation as a ballad singer, in marked contrast to the content on &quot;Wizard&quot;. Although critical reception to the album was mixed, &quot;Wizard&quot; became highly influential to musicians in the ensuing decades. In 2003, music journalist Barney Hoskyns called the record &quot;the greatest album of all time ... a dizzying, intoxicating rollercoaster ride of emotions and genre mutations [that] still sounds more bravely futuristic than any ostensibly cutting-edge electro-pop being made in the 21st Century.&quot; In 2018, &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Sam Sodomsky wrote that the &quot;fingerprints&quot; of &quot;Wizard&quot; remained &quot;evident on bedroom auteurs to this day&quot;.

In the weeks following the album&#x27;s release, Rundgren produced Grand Funk Railroad&#x27;s &quot;We&#x27;re an American Band&quot; and the New York Dolls&#x27; self-titled debut album, which were among the most significant LPs of the year. The former album reached number two on the US charts, while the latter became a seminal forerunner of punk rock, although Rundgren never became known as a &quot;punk producer&quot;. Rundgren also prepared a technologically ambitious stage show with a band later to be known as Utopia Mark I, consisting of Tony Sales, Hunt Sales, keyboardist Dave Mason, and synthesizer specialist Jean-Yves &quot;M Frog&quot; Labat. The tour began in April and was cancelled after only a couple weeks on the road.

Once Rundgren was finished with his production duties, he began formulating plans for an improved configuration of Utopia, but first returned to Secret Sound to record the more synthesizer-heavy double album &quot;Todd&quot;, which was more material drawing on his hallucinogenic experiences. This time, he had also formed a fascination with religion and spirituality, reading books by authors such as Madame Blavatsky, Rudolf Steiner, and Jiddu Krishnamurti. Originally scheduled for release in December 1973, &quot;Todd&quot; was delayed to the next February due to a vinyl shortage caused by the 1973 oil crisis.

During the making of &quot;Todd&quot;, Rundgren took note of the &quot;fusion jazz sensibility&quot; between session musicians Kevin Ellman (drums) and John Siegler (bass). Rundgren chose them, along with Klingman and keyboardist Ralph Shuckett, to be the new configuration of Utopia. This line-up performed their first show at Central Park on August 25, 1973, sharing the bill with the Brecker Brothers and Hall &amp; Oates. Utopia played more shows throughout November and December, performing material from &quot;Something/Anything?&quot; and &quot;Wizard&quot; after a solo opening set by Rundgren on piano playing along to a pre-recorded track. On December 7, Rundgren appeared by himself on &quot;The Midnight Special&quot; performing &quot;Hello It&#x27;s Me&quot; while dressed in jarringly flamboyant glam attire to the chagrin of some of his bandmates and Bearsville executive Paul Fishkin, who recalled that Rundgren looked &quot;like a fucking drag queen&quot;.

Utopia embarked on their first successful tour between March and April 1974, after which Rundgren produced Hello People&#x27;s &quot;The Handsome Devils&quot; and Hall &amp; Oates&#x27; &quot;War Babies&quot;. The band&#x27;s debut record came in the form of the LP titled &quot;Todd Rundgren&#x27;s Utopia&quot; (November 1974). It marked Rundgren&#x27;s first full-fledged venture into the progressive rock genre. Utopia released several more albums between 1975 and 1985. Although they gradually rebranded toward a rock-pop sound, &quot;Todd Rundgren&#x27;s Utopia&quot; remained their highest album chart showing at number 34. Keyboardist Roger Powell recalled that Bearsville wished Utopia would have &quot;just gone away&quot;, however, &quot;Todd&#x27;s contract called for a certain number of albums over a certain number of years, so he decided that every other album would be a solo album and the next one a Utopia album.&quot; 

====&quot;Initiation&quot;, &quot;Faithful&quot;, and &quot;Hermit of Mink Hollow&quot;====
&quot;A Wizard, a True Star&quot; included &quot;Rock N Roll Pussy&quot;, a song aimed at former Beatle John Lennon. In 1974, Rundgren and Lennon were embroiled in a minor feud over comments Rundgren made in the February edition of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; magazine. In the article, he accused Lennon of striking a waitress at the Troubadour in Hollywood and called him a &quot;fucking idiot&quot; proselytizing revolution and &quot;acting like an ass&quot;. In September, the magazine published Lennon&#x27;s response, in which he denied the charges and referred to the musician as &quot;Turd Runtgreen&quot;: &quot;I have never claimed to be a revolutionary. But I am allowed to sing about anything I want! Right?&quot; Later, Rundgren said, &quot;John and I realized we were being used and I got a phone call from him one day and we just said: &#x27;Let&#x27;s drop this now.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;Initiation&quot; (1975) showed more experimentation with synthesizers, and displayed the musical influence of the avant-garde jazz fusion of contemporary acts such as the Mahavishnu Orchestra and Frank Zappa. Once again the original LP issue saw Rundgren pushing the medium to its physical limits, with the side-long suite &quot;A Treatise on Cosmic Fire&quot; clocking in at over 35 minutes.

Released in May 1976, &quot;Faithful&quot; saw Rundgren celebrating his tenth year as a professional musician. The album featured one side of original songs and one side of covers of significant songs from 1966, including the Yardbirds&#x27; &quot;Happenings Ten Years Time Ago&quot;, the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, and two Lennon-penned Beatles songs. The arrangements of the covers were intended to sound as close to the originals as possible, and Rundgren&#x27;s original songs were written as a reflection of his 1960s influences. He cited the song &quot;The Verb &#x27;To Love&#x27;&quot; as the point in which he made the conscious decision to stop writing superficial love songs and &quot;seek out all other kinds of subject matter to write about&quot;. Despite the lack of sales and promotion for &quot;Faithful&quot;, lead single &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; received regular airplay on American radio.

Following the completion of &quot;Faithful&quot;, Rundgren spent two months on an eastern spiritual retreat, visiting Iran, Afghanistan, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bali, Thailand, Japan, and Hawaii. He also opened Utopia Sound Studios in Lake Hill, New York, just outside of Woodstock, and bought a home nearby, as well as an adjoining property to be taken over as accommodation for artists who used the studio. The Lake Hill complex on Mink Hollow Road remained Rundgren&#x27;s base for the next six years. In the interim until his next solo effort, he recorded three albums with Utopia. The first, &quot;Disco Jets&quot;, was a tongue-in-cheek collection of instrumental disco tracks left unreleased until 2001. &quot;Ra&quot; (February 1977) was a concept album based on Egyptian mythology, which prefaced a lavish tour involving an extravagant stage set with a giant pyramid and Sphynx head. &quot;Oops! Wrong Planet&quot; (September 1977), recorded immediately after the tour, signaled the start of a more pop-oriented direction for the group.

By late 1977, Rundgren was in the midst of separating from then-girlfriend Bebe Buell and their infant daughter Liv Tyler. Rundgren recalled leaving his home in New York City and sequestering himself at Mink Hollow, &quot;after I discovered that I didn&#x27;t want to cohabit any longer with Bebe, in any sense of the word ... A fortunate by-product of being so out of everything all the time and always being the odd man out ... is that you have plenty of time for self-examination.&quot; He intended the songs on his next solo album to be performed on piano with minimal arrangements, apart from the bass, drums and voices. In that sense, he stated that the songwriting process appeared to be &quot;fairly conventional&quot;.

&quot;Hermit of Mink Hollow&quot; was released in May 1978. Popularly viewed as his most immediately accessible work since &quot;Something/Anything?&quot;, it received more public attention and radio airplay than most of Rundgren&#x27;s efforts since &quot;A Wizard, a True Star&quot; and was heralded as a &quot;return to form&quot; after the string of prog records with Utopia. In the US, the LP peaked at number 36, while single &quot;Can We Still Be Friends&quot; reached number 29. The song became Rundgren&#x27;s most-covered, with versions by Robert Palmer, Rod Stewart, Colin Blunstone, and Mandy Moore. To promote the work, Rundgren undertook an American tour playing at smaller venues including The Bottom Line in New York and The Roxy in Los Angeles. These shows resulted in the double live album &quot;Back to the Bars&quot;, which featured a mixture of material from his solo work and Utopia, performed with backing musicians including Utopia, Spencer Davis, Daryl Hall and John Oates and Stevie Nicks.

In 1980, Utopia recorded a Beatles parody album in the form of &quot;Deface the Music&quot;. It included &quot;Everybody Else Is Wrong&quot;, another song perceived to have been aimed at Lennon. Later that year, Lennon was killed by Mark David Chapman, an obsessive Rundgren fan who was incensed by Lennon&#x27;s remarks on religion. When he was apprehended, Chapman was wearing a promotional T-shirt for &quot;Hermit of Mink Hollow&quot; and had left a copy of &quot;Runt. The Ballad of Todd Rundgren&quot; in his hotel room. Rundgren was not aware of the connections until &quot;way after the fact&quot;. When asked about the &quot;Melody Maker&quot; feud, Chapman stated he was not aware of the musicians&#x27; interactions in the press until years after they occurred.

====&quot;Healing&quot; and &quot;Tortured Artist Effect&quot;====
The year 1981 saw the album-long concept work &quot;Healing&quot;. His music video for the song &quot;Time Heals&quot; was among the first videos aired on MTV, and a video he produced for RCA, accompanied by Gustav Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot;, was used as a demo for their videodisc players. Rundgren&#x27;s experience with computer graphics dates back to 1981, when he developed one of the first computer paint programs, dubbed the Utopia Graphics System; it ran on an Apple II with Apple&#x27;s digitizer tablet. He is also the co-developer of the computer screensaver system Flowfazer.

During this period, Rundgren&#x27;s Mink Hollow home was robbed. He and his girlfriend were tied up in the home by the robbers as part of the crime. 

The new wave-tinged &quot;The Ever Popular Tortured Artist Effect&quot; (1982) included a cover of the Small Faces&#x27; hit &quot;Tin Soldier&quot;. &quot;Bang The Drum All Day&quot;, an album single, was a minor chart hit. It later became more prominent and was adopted as an unofficial theme by several professional sports franchises, notably the Green Bay Packers. Disc Jockey Geno Michellini of KLOS in Los Angeles used &quot;Bang The Drum All Day&quot; as an unofficial kick-off to the weekend on Friday afternoons. &quot;Bang The Drum All Day&quot; was also featured in a Carnival Cruise television advertising campaign. It is now considered one of Rundgren&#x27;s most popular songs. &quot;Tortured Artist&quot; marked the end of Rundgren&#x27;s tenure with Bearsville Records.

===1980s–1990s: &quot;A Cappella&quot;, &quot;Nearly Human&quot;, and &quot;2nd Wind&quot;===
Rundgren signed with Warner Bros. Records, who issued his next album, &quot;A Cappella&quot; (1985), which was recorded using Rundgren&#x27;s multi-tracked voice, accompanied by arrangements constructed entirely from programmed vocal samples. Rundgren scored four episodes of the popular children&#x27;s television show &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; in 1986.

&quot;Nearly Human&quot; (1989) and &quot;2nd Wind&quot; (1991) were both recorded live—the former in the studio, the latter in a theater before a live audience, who were instructed to remain silent. Each song on these albums was recorded as a complete single take with no later overdubbing. Both albums marked, in part, a return to his Philly soul roots. &quot;2nd Wind&quot; also included several excerpts from Rundgren&#x27;s musical &quot;Up Against It&quot;, which was adapted from the screenplay (originally titled &quot;Prick Up Your Ears&quot;), that British playwright Joe Orton had originally offered to the Beatles for their never-made follow-up to &quot;Help!&quot;.

Rundgren was an early adopter of the NewTek Video Toaster and made several videos with it. The first, for &quot;Change Myself&quot; from &quot;2nd Wind&quot;, was widely distributed as a demo reel for the Toaster. Later, he set up a company to produce 3D animation using the Toaster; this company&#x27;s first demo, &quot;Theology&quot; (a look at religious architecture through the ages featuring music by former Utopia bandmate Roger Powell) also became a widely circulated item among Toaster users.

In 1989, Rundgren hit the road with &quot;Nearly Human—2nd Wind&quot; band, which included brass and a trio of backup singers (one of whom, Michele Gray, Rundgren married). He also toured during 1992 with Ringo Starr&#x27;s second All-Starr band.
A brief 1992 tour of Japan reunited the Rundgren/Powell/Sulton/Wilcox lineup, and &quot;Redux &#x27;92: Live in Japan&quot; was released on Rhino Records.

===1990s–2000s: TR-I, PatroNet, and &quot;Liars&quot;===
The mid-1990s saw Rundgren recording under the pseudonym TR-i (&quot;Todd Rundgren interactive&quot;) for two albums. The first of these, 1993&#x27;s &quot;No World Order&quot;, consisted of hundreds of seconds-long snippets of music, that could be combined in various ways to suit the listener. Initially targeted for the Philips CD-i platform, &quot;No World Order&quot; featured interactive controls for tempo, mood, and other parameters, along with pre-programmed mixes by Rundgren himself, Bob Clearmountain, Don Was and Jerry Harrison. The disc was also released for PC and Macintosh and in two versions on standard audio CD, the continuous mix disc &quot;No World Order&quot; and, later, the more song-oriented &quot;No World Order Lite&quot;. The music itself was quite a departure from Rundgren&#x27;s previous work, with a dance/techno feel and much rapping by Rundgren. The follow-up, &quot;The Individualist&quot; (1995), featured interactive video content, that could be viewed or in one case, played; it was a simple video game along with the music, which was more rock-oriented than &quot;No World Order&quot;.

Rundgren returned to recording under his own name for &quot;With a Twist...&quot; (1997), an album of bossa-nova covers of his older material. His PatroNet work, which trickled out to subscribers over more than a year, was released in 2000 as &quot;One Long Year&quot;. In 2004, Rundgren released &quot;Liars&quot;, a concept album about &quot;paucity of truth&quot;, that features a mixture of his older and newer sounds.

As the Internet gained mass acceptance, Rundgren, along with longtime manager Eric Gardner and Apple digital music exec Kelli Richards, started PatroNet, which offered fans (patrons) access to his works-in-progress and new unreleased tracks in exchange for a subscription fee, cutting out record labels. The songs from Rundgren&#x27;s first PatroNet run were later released as the album &quot;One Long Year&quot;. Since then, Rundgren has severed his connections with major record labels and continues to offer new music direct to subscribers via his website, although he also continues to record and release CDs through independent labels. As of 2022, the PatroNet.com website was not active.

===2000s–2010s===
In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, Rundgren created the score for the film &quot;A Face to a Name&quot;, directed by Douglas Sloan. The film depicted numerous photographs of missing New Yorkers that were displayed on Bellevue Hospital&#x27;s &#x27;wall of prayers&#x27; following the attacks. The film was part of a special screening at the Woodstock Film Festival in 2002.

In late 2005, the Boston-based band the Cars were planning to re-form despite bassist Benjamin Orr&#x27;s death and lack of interest on the part of former lead singer Ric Ocasek. Rumors followed that Rundgren had joined Elliot Easton and Greg Hawkes in rehearsals for a possible new Cars lineup. Initial speculation pointed to the New Cars being fleshed out with Clem Burke of Blondie and Art Alexakis of Everclear. Eventually the group completed their lineup with former Rundgren bassist Kasim Sulton and studio drummer Prairie Prince of the Tubes, who had played on XTC&#x27;s Rundgren-produced &quot;Skylarking&quot; and who has recorded and toured with Rundgren.

In early 2006, the new lineup played a few private shows for industry professionals, played live on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and made other media appearances before commencing a 2006 summer tour with the re-formed Blondie. Rundgren referred to the project as &quot;an opportunity ... for me to pay my bills, play to a larger audience, work with musicians I know and like, and ideally have some fun for a year.&quot; The New Cars&#x27; first single, &quot;Not Tonight&quot;, was released on March 20, 2006. A live album/greatest hits collection, &quot;The New Cars: It&#x27;s Alive&quot;, was released in June 2006. The album includes classic Cars songs (and two Rundgren hits) recorded live plus three new studio tracks (&quot;Not Tonight&quot;, &quot;Warm&quot;, and &quot;More&quot;)

In April 2011, &quot;Todd Rundgren&#x27;s Johnson&quot;, a collection of Robert Johnson covers, which had been recorded more than a year earlier, was released. In another 2011, an album of covers, &quot;(re)Production&quot;, features Rundgren performing tracks he had previously produced for other acts, including Grand Funk Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Walk Like a Man&quot; and XTC&#x27;s &quot;Dear God&quot;.

In 2017, Rundgren released &quot;White Knight&quot;, which features collaborations with Trent Reznor, Robyn, Daryl Hall, Joe Walsh and Donald Fagen.

In December 2018, Cleopatra Press published his self-penned memoir, &quot;The Individualist: Digressions, Dreams, and Dissertations&quot;. The book contains 181 chapters, each one page long, and each consisting of three paragraphs. He said that &quot;I realized that I have to do this or somebody else will do it. I&#x27;m getting to the point where I could at some point not be able to do it myself, and then someone else would do it and I wouldn&#x27;t be happy with the result.&quot; Its coverage ends at Rundgren&#x27;s 50th birthday in 1998, which was the same time he began writing the book. Since then, he said, &quot;my life has been a lot more boring ... I&#x27;m not doing as much record production as I used to, so interesting tales that go along with those projects don&#x27;t exist anymore.&quot; On October 21, 2019, he stopped by the Library of Congress and signed a braille copy—which was produced for him by a fan and National Library Service for the Blind and Print Disabled patron who is blind.

Rundgren toured in late 2019 with Micky Dolenz, Jason Scheff, Christopher Cross and Joey Molland of Badfinger in celebration of the Beatles&#x27; self-titled 1968 album on the &quot;It Was Fifty Years Ago Today – A Tribute to the Beatles&#x27; White Album&quot;.

===2020s===
Rundgren collaborated with Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo in 2020, releasing the single &quot;Down With The Ship&quot;. In December, he released his English translation of the 1978 song &quot;Flappie&quot;, originally by Dutch comedian Youp van &#x27;t Hek. That April, he reunited with Sparks 50 years after producing their debut album, releasing a single &quot;Your Fandango&quot;. In September 2022, he released the album &quot;Space Force&quot;.

He provided additional vocals along with the Sunday Service Choir, on the track &quot;My Soul&quot;, by hip hop superduo ¥$, from their album &quot;Vultures 2&quot;, released on 3 August 2024.

==Style and recognition==
===As a solo artist===
Writing for AllMusic, music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine recognizes Rundgren thus:

As a solo artist from 1972 to 1978, Rundgren scored four US Top 40 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, including one Top 10 hit with &quot;Hello, It&#x27;s Me&quot;, and three US Top 40 albums on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. He is one of the first acts to be prominent both as an artist and as a producer. and he was also influential in the fields of power pop, lo-fi, overdubbing, and experimental music. Rundgren performed in an eclectic variety of styles, so much so that his singles often contrasted with other tracks from the LPs from which they derived, which curtailed his mass appeal. Of his early incorporation of digital technology, he said &quot;I wasn&#x27;t the first to start recording digitally, because it was so expensive. But once the technology came down to where I could afford it, then I went digital.&quot; Rundgren said that adapting his sound to meet commercial expectations was also never an issue for him since he already made &quot;so much money from production&quot;, a rare luxury for an artist.

===As a producer===

Comparisons are sometimes drawn between Rundgren and producer/artists Brian Wilson and Brian Eno. Biographer Paul Myers attributes the recording studio to be Rundgren&#x27;s &quot;ultimate instrument&quot;. Rundgren acknowledged that, in the case of his own records, he does not think &quot;as a producer&quot;, but uses the studio to &quot;assist in creating a performance&quot;. His recording processes continued in the same tradition as multitrack recording innovator Les Paul as well as the studio experiments of the Beatles and the Beach Boys.

According to biographer Myers, Rundgren himself came to inspire &quot;a generation of self-contained geniuses like Prince ... Ironically, some of his innovations would come to liberate the recording artist in such a way as to lessen the perceived value, or need, for a record producer at all.&quot; Rundgren&#x27;s influence is also cited to Hall &amp; Oates, Björk and Daft Punk. &quot;Slate&quot; writer Marc Weingarten identified &quot;A Cappella&quot; as the precedent for Björk&#x27;s &quot;all vocals, all the time&quot; experiment &quot;Medúlla&quot; (2004) and said that, overall, &quot;The two [artists] share more common ground than their fans might think.&quot;

Rundgren&#x27;s production work for other artists were largely one-off affairs. Exceptions were Grand Funk Railroad, the New York Dolls, the Tubes, Hello People, and the Pursuit of Happiness. He described his typical function as being a &quot;&#x27;songcraft&#x27; agitator&quot;. In cases where the act&#x27;s songs were unfinished, he would complete them and decline a writer&#x27;s credit. Some of his collaborators frequently characterize him as a &quot;genius&quot;, but also &quot;sarcastic&quot; and &quot;aloof&quot;. His most notorious production was for XTC&#x27;s 1986 album &quot;Skylarking&quot;, known for the creative tensions and disagreements that arose during its sessions. The album is sometimes regarded as both the pinnacle of Rundgren&#x27;s production career and of the career of XTC. He commented that, in spite of the turmoil surrounding its making, the record &quot;ultimately ... sounds like we were having a great time doing it. And at times we &quot;were&quot; having a good time.&quot; All three members expressed admiration for the end product.

===The Fool guitar===

During the mid-to-late 1970s, Rundgren regularly played the eye-catching psychedelic Gibson SG (known variously as &quot;Sunny&quot; or &quot;The Fool&quot;), which Eric Clapton had played in Cream. After he had stopped using it ca. 1968, Clapton gave the guitar to George Harrison, who subsequently &#x27;loaned&#x27; it to British singer Jackie Lomax. In 1972, after meeting at a recording session, Lomax sold the guitar to Rundgren for $500 with an option to buy it back, which he never took up. Rundgren played it extensively during the early years of Utopia before retiring the instrument for a short time in the mid to late 1970s, which in that time he had the guitar restored having a lacquer finish applied to protect the paint and replaced the tailpiece and bridge to stabilize tuning, bringing the guitar back out on tour during the 1980 Deface the Music tour and using it on and off throughout the 1980s until 1993 when he permanently retired the guitar, eventually auctioning it off in 1999; he now uses a reproduction given to him in 1988 by a Japanese fan.

==Personal life==
Rundgren began a relationship with model Bebe Buell in 1972. During a break in their relationship, Buell had a brief relationship with Steven Tyler, which resulted in an unplanned pregnancy. Buell gave birth to Liv Tyler on July 1, 1977. Buell initially claimed that Todd Rundgren was the biological father and named the child Liv Rundgren. Shortly after Liv&#x27;s birth, Rundgren and Buell ended their romantic relationship, but Rundgren remained committed to Liv. At age eleven, Liv learned that her biological father was Steven Tyler. According to Liv Tyler, &quot;Todd basically decided when I was born that I needed a father so he signed my birth certificate. He knew that there was a chance that I might not be his, but…&quot; He paid to put her through private school, and she visited him several times a year. As of 2012, Tyler maintains a close relationship with Rundgren. &quot;I&#x27;m so grateful to him, I have so much love for him. You know, when he holds me it feels like Daddy. And he&#x27;s very protective and strong.&quot; Buell&#x27;s stated reason for claiming that Rundgren was Liv&#x27;s father was that Tyler was too heavily addicted to drugs at the time of Liv&#x27;s birth.

Rundgren had a long-term relationship with Karen Darvin, with whom he had two sons, Rex (born 1980) and Randy (born 1985). Rex was a minor league baseball player (infielder) for nine seasons. Darvin had previously been in a relationship with Bruce Springsteen.

Rundgren married Michele Gray in 1998. Gray had been a dancer with the Tubes and had performed with Rundgren as a backup singer on the tour for his album &quot;Nearly Human&quot; which led to a number of appearances on &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot; as one of &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Backup Singers&quot;. Together, they have a son, named Rebop, and an adoptive son, named Keoni.

Paul Myers, in his 2010 book on Rundgren, &quot;A Wizard, a True Star: Todd Rundgren in the Studio&quot;, reported that Rundgren diagnosed himself with attention-deficit disorder.

==Awards and honors==
* 1984: Grammy Award nomination for Best Music Video – &quot;Videosyncracy&quot;
* 1995: Berkeley Lifetime Achievement Award from the Popular Culture Society at UC Berkeley.
* 2017: Honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music, where he delivered the commencement address, and an honorary doctorate from DePauw University.
* 2018: Nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s class of 2019. Since becoming eligible in 1995, he has often been asked about his absence from the Hall of Fame. A 2018 poll conducted by the institution, which is not factored in the final vote, placed Rundgren as the third-most deserving nominee on the ballot. In 2016, Rundgren told an interviewer: &quot;It doesn&#x27;t have the same cachet as a Nobel Peace Prize or some historical foundation. If I told you about how they actually determine who gets into the Hall of Fame, you&#x27;d think that I was bullshitting you, because I&#x27;ve been told what&#x27;s involved. ... It&#x27;s just as corrupt as anything else, and that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t care.&quot;
* 2021: Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

<doc id="36796" wikidata="Q423762" url="?curid=36796" title="Paclitaxel">
<text>Paclitaxel, sold under the brand name Taxol among others, is a chemotherapy medication used to treat ovarian cancer, esophageal cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma, cervical cancer, and pancreatic cancer. It is administered by intravenous injection. There is also an albumin-bound formulation.
Common side effects include hair loss, bone marrow suppression, numbness, allergic reactions, muscle pains, and diarrhea. Other side effects include heart problems, increased risk of infection, and lung inflammation. There are concerns that use during pregnancy may cause birth defects. Paclitaxel is in the taxane family of medications. It works by interference with the normal function of microtubules during cell division.
Paclitaxel was isolated in 1971 from the Pacific yew and approved for medical use in 1993. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It has been made from precursors, and through cell culture.

==Medical use==
Paclitaxel is approved in the UK for ovarian, breast, lung, bladder, prostate, melanoma, esophageal, and other types of solid tumor cancers as well as Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma.

It is recommended in National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance of June 2001 for non-small-cell lung cancer in patients unsuitable for curative treatment, and in first-line and second-line treatment of ovarian cancer. In September 2001, NICE recommended paclitaxel for the treatment of advanced breast cancer after the failure of anthracyclic chemotherapy, but that its first-line use should be limited to clinical trials. In September 2006, NICE recommended paclitaxel should &quot;not&quot; be used in the adjuvant treatment of early node-positive breast cancer.

It is approved in the United States for the treatment of breast, pancreatic, ovarian, Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma and non-small-cell lung cancers.

===Similar compounds===

Albumin-bound paclitaxel (brand name Abraxane, also called nab-paclitaxel) is an alternative formulation where paclitaxel is bound to albumin nanoparticles. Much of the clinical toxicity of paclitaxel is associated with the solvent Cremophor EL in which it is dissolved for delivery.

Abraxis BioScience developed Abraxane, in which paclitaxel is bonded to albumin as an alternative delivery agent to the often toxic solvent delivery method. This was approved by the FDA in January 2005, for the treatment of breast cancer after failure of combination chemotherapy for metastatic disease or relapse within six months of adjuvant chemotherapy. It has since been approved for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas as well.

Taxanes, including paclitaxel, 10-deacetylbaccatin III, baccatin III, paclitaxel C, and 7-epipaclitaxel, have been found in the leaves and shells of hazel. The finding of these compounds in shells, which are considered discarded material and are mass-produced by many food industries, is of interest for the future availability of paclitaxel.

===Restenosis===
Paclitaxel is used as an antiproliferative agent for the prevention of restenosis (recurrent narrowing) of coronary and peripheral stents; locally delivered to the wall of the artery, a paclitaxel coating limits the growth of neointima (scar tissue) within stents. Paclitaxel drug-eluting stents for coronary artery placement are sold under the trade name Taxus by Boston Scientific in the United States. Paclitaxel drug-eluting stents for femoropopliteal artery placement are also available.

==Side effects==
Common side effects include nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, change in taste, thinned or brittle hair, pain in the joints of the arms or legs lasting two to three days, changes in the color of the nails, and tingling in the hands or toes. More serious side effects such as unusual bruising or bleeding, pain, redness or swelling at the injection site, hand-foot syndrome, change in normal bowel habits for more than two days, fever, chills, cough, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, dizziness, shortness of breath, severe exhaustion, skin rash, facial flushing, female infertility by ovarian damage, and chest pain can also occur. Neuropathy may also occur.

Dexamethasone is given prior to paclitaxel infusion to mitigate some of the side effects.

A number of these side effects are associated with the excipient used, Cremophor EL, a polyoxyethylated castor oil. Allergies to cyclosporine, teniposide, and other drugs delivered in polyoxyethylated castor oil may increase the risk of adverse reactions to paclitaxel.

==Mechanism of action==

Paclitaxel is one of several cytoskeletal drugs that target tubulin. Paclitaxel-treated cells have defects in mitotic spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, and cell division. Unlike other tubulin-targeting drugs, such as colchicine, that inhibit microtubule assembly, paclitaxel stabilizes the microtubule polymer and protects it from disassembly. Chromosomes are thus unable to achieve a metaphase spindle configuration. This blocks the progression of mitosis and prolonged activation of the mitotic checkpoint triggers apoptosis or reversion to the G0-phase of the cell cycle without cell division.

The ability of paclitaxel to inhibit spindle function is generally attributed to its suppression of microtubule dynamics, but other studies have demonstrated that suppression of dynamics occurs at concentrations lower than those needed to block mitosis. At the higher therapeutic concentrations, paclitaxel appears to suppress microtubule detachment from centrosomes, a process normally activated during mitosis. Paclitaxel binds to the beta-tubulin subunits of microtubules.

== Chemistry ==

The nomenclature for paclitaxel is structured on a tetracyclic 17-atom skeleton. There are a total of 11 stereocenters. The active stereoisomer is (−)-paclitaxel (shown here).

==Production==
=== Bark processing ===
From 1967 to 1993, almost all paclitaxel produced was derived from bark of the Pacific yew, &quot;Taxus brevifolia&quot;, the harvesting of which kills the tree in the process. The processes used were descendants of the original isolation method of Monroe Wall and Mansukh Wani; by 1987, the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) had contracted Hauser Chemical Research of Boulder, Colorado, to handle bark on the scale needed for phase II and III trials. While both the size of the wild population of the Pacific yew and the magnitude of the eventual demand for paclitaxel were uncertain, it was clear that an alternative, sustainable source of the natural product would be needed. Initial attempts to broaden its sourcing used needles from the tree, or material from other related &quot;Taxus&quot; species, including cultivated ones, but these attempts were challenged by the relatively low and often highly variable yields obtained. Early in the 1990s, coincident with increased sensitivity to the ecology of the forests of the Pacific Northwest, paclitaxel was extracted on a clinically useful scale from these sources.

=== Semisynthesis ===
Concurrently, synthetic chemists in the U.S. and France had been interested in paclitaxel, beginning in the late 1970s. As noted, by 1992 extensive efforts were underway to accomplish the total synthesis of paclitaxel, efforts motivated by the desire to generate new chemical understanding rather than to achieve practical commercial production. In contrast, the French group of Pierre Potier at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) addressed the matter of overall process yield, showing that it was feasible to isolate relatively large quantities of the compound 10-deacetylbaccatin from the European yew, &quot;Taxus baccata&quot;, which grew on the CNRS campus and whose needles were available in large quantity. By virtue of its structure, 10-deacetylbaccatin was seen as a viable starting material for a short semisynthesis to produce paclitaxel. By 1988, Poitier and collaborators had published a semisynthetic route from needles of the European yew to paclitaxel.

The view of the NCI, however, was that even this route was not practical. The group of Robert A. Holton had also pursued a practical semisynthetic production route; by late 1989, Holton&#x27;s group had developed a semisynthetic route to paclitaxel with twice the yield of the Potier process. The main innovation was &quot;Ojima−Holton coupling&quot;, a ring-opening method independently discovered by Holton and Ojima. Florida State University, where Holton worked, signed a deal with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) to license their semisynthesis and future patents. In 1992, Holton patented an improved process with an 80% yield, and BMS took the process in-house and started to manufacture paclitaxel in Ireland from 10-deacetylbaccatin isolated from the needles of the European yew. In early 1993, BMS announced that it would cease reliance on Pacific yew bark by the end of 1995, effectively terminating ecological controversy over its use. This announcement also made good their commitment to develop an alternative supply route, made to the NCI in their cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) application of 1989.

As of 2013, BMS was using the semisynthetic method utilizing needles from the European yew to produce paclitaxel. Another company which worked with BMS until 2012, Phyton Biotech, Inc., uses plant cell fermentation (PCF) technology. By cultivating a specific &quot;Taxus&quot; cell line in fermentation tanks, they no longer need ongoing sourcing of material from actual yew tree plantations. Paclitaxel is then captured directly from the suspension broth by a resin allowing concentration to highly enriched powder containing about 40% paclitaxel. The compound is then purified by one chromatographic step followed by crystallization. Compared to the semisynthesis method, PCF eliminates the need for many hazardous chemicals and saves a considerable amount of energy.

In 1993, paclitaxel was discovered as a natural product in &quot;Taxomyces andreanae&quot;, a newly described endophytic fungus living in the yew tree. It has since been reported in a number of other endophytic fungi, including &quot;Nodulisporium sylviforme&quot;, &quot;Alternaria taxi&quot;, &quot;Cladosporium cladosporioides&quot; MD2, &quot;Metarhizium anisopliae&quot;, &quot;Aspergillus candidus&quot; MD3, &quot;Mucor rouxianus&quot;, &quot;Chaetomella raphigera&quot;, &quot;Phyllosticta tabernaemontanae&quot;, &quot;Phomopsis&quot;, &quot;Pestalotiopsis pauciseta&quot;, &quot;Phyllosticta citricarpa&quot;, &quot;Podocarpus&quot; sp., &quot;Fusarium solani&quot;, &quot;Pestalotiopsis terminaliae&quot;, &quot;Pestalotiopsis breviseta&quot;, &quot;Botryodiplodia theobromae&quot;, &quot;Gliocladium&quot; sp., &quot;Alternaria alternata&quot; var. &quot;monosporus&quot;, &quot;Cladosporium cladosporioides&quot;, &quot;Nigrospora&quot; sp. and &quot;Pestalotiopsis versicolor&quot;. However, there has been contradictory evidence for its production by endophytes, with other studies finding independent production is unlikely.

===Biosynthesis===

Taxol is a tetracyclic diterpene, and the biosynthesis of diterpenes starts with an FPP molecule being elongated by the addition of an IPP molecule in order to form geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP). The biosynthesis of Taxol contains nineteen steps. These 19 steps can be considered in several steps, with the first step being the formation of the taxane skeleton, which then undergoes a series of oxygenations. Following the oxygenations, two acetylations and a benzoylation occur on the intermediate. The oxygenation of the taxane core is believed to occur on C5 and C10, C2 and C9, C13 followed by C7, and a C1 hydroxylation later on in the pathway. Later in the pathway, an oxidation at C9 forms a ketone functional group and an oxetane, forming the intermediate baccatin III. The final steps of the pathway include the formation of a C13-side chain which is attached to baccatin III. The biosynthesis of Taxol is illustrated in more detail in the figure, with steps 1-7 all occurring in the enzyme taxadiene synthase (TS on the figure). Taxol&#x27;s biosynthesis begins with E,E,E-GGPP losing pyrophosphate via an SN1 mechanism (step 1 in the figure). The double-bond attacks the cation via electrophilic addition, yielding a tertiary cation and creating the first ring closure (step 2). Another electrophilic attack occurs, further cyclizing the structure by creating the first 6-membered ring and creating another tertiary cation (step 3). An intramolecular proton transfer occurs, attacking the verticillyl cation (step 4) and creating a double bond, yielding a tertiary cation. An electrophilic cyclization occurs in step 5, and an intramolecular proton transfer attacks the taxenyl cation (step 6). This forms the fused ring structure intermediate known as taxadiene. Taxadiene then undergoes a series of 10 oxidations via NADPH, forming the intermediate taxadiene-5α-acetoxy-10β-ol (multiple steps later in the figure). A series of hydroxylations and esterficiations occur, forming the intermediate 10-deacetyl-baccatin III, which undergoes a further series of esterifications and a side-chain hydroxylation. This finally yields the product taxol.

===Total synthesis===

By 1992, at least thirty academic research teams globally were working to achieve a total synthesis of this natural product, with the synthesis proceeding from simple natural products and other readily available starting materials. This total synthesis effort was motivated primarily by the desire to generate new chemical understanding, rather than with an expectation of the practical commercial production of paclitaxel. The first laboratories to complete the total synthesis from much less complex starting materials were the research groups of Robert A. Holton, who had the first article to be accepted for publication, and of K. C. Nicolaou who had the first article to appear in print (by a week, on 7 February 1994). Though the Holton submission preceded the Nicolaou by a month (21 December 1993 versus 24 January 1994), the near coincidence of the publications arising from each of these massive, multiyear efforts—11–18 authors appearing on each of the February 1994 publications—has led the ending of the race to be termed a &quot;tie&quot; or a &quot;photo finish&quot;, though each group has argued that their synthetic strategy and tactics were superior.

As of 2006, five additional research groups had reported total syntheses of paclitaxel: Wender et al. in 1997, and Kuwajima et al. and Mukaiyama et al. in 1998 with further linear syntheses, and Danishefsky et al. in 1996 and Takahashi et al. in 2006 with further convergent syntheses. As of that date, all strategies had aimed to prepare a 10-deacetylbaccatin-type core containing the ABCD ring system, followed generally by last stage addition of the &quot;tail&quot; to the 13-hydroxyl group.

While the &quot;political climate surrounding [paclitaxel] and [the Pacific yew] in the early 1990s ... helped bolster [a] link between total synthesis and the [paclitaxel] supply problem,&quot; and though total synthesis activities were a requisite to explore the structure-activity relationships of paclitaxel via generation of analogs for testing, the total synthesis efforts were never seen &quot;as a serious commercial route&quot; to provide significant quantities of the natural product for medical testing or therapeutic use.

==History==
The discovery of paclitaxel began in 1962 as a result of a NCI-funded screening program. A number of years later it was isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew, &quot;Taxus brevifolia&quot;, hence its name &quot;taxol&quot;.

The discovery was made by Monroe E. Wall and Mansukh C. Wani at the Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, in 1971. These scientists isolated the natural product from the bark of the Pacific yew tree, determined its structure and named it &quot;taxol&quot;, and arranged for its first biological testing. The compound was then developed commercially by BMS, who had the generic name assigned as &quot;paclitaxel&quot;.

===Plant screening program===
In 1955, the NCI in the United States set up the Cancer Chemotherapy National Service Center (CCNSC) to act as a public screening center for anticancer activity in compounds submitted by external institutions and companies. Although the majority of compounds screened were of synthetic origin, one chemist, Jonathan Hartwell, who was employed there from 1958 onwards, had experience with natural product derived compounds, and began a plant screening operation.

After some years of informal arrangements, in July 1960, the NCI commissioned the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) botanists to collect samples from about 1,000 plant species per year. On 21 August 1962, one of those botanists, Arthur S. Barclay, collected bark from a single Pacific yew tree in a forest north of the town of Packwood, Washington, as part of a four-month trip to collect material from over 200 different species. The material was then processed by a number of specialist CCNSC subcontractors, and one of the tree&#x27;s samples was found to be cytotoxic in a cellular assay on 22 May 1964.

Accordingly, in late 1964 or early 1965, the fractionation and isolation laboratory run by Monroe E. Wall in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, began work on fresh &quot;Taxus&quot; samples, isolating the active ingredient in September 1966 and announcing their findings at an April 1967 American Chemical Society meeting in Miami Beach. They named the pure compound taxol in June 1967. Wall and his colleague Wani published their results, including the chemical structure, in 1971.

The NCI continued to commission work to collect more &quot;Taxus&quot; bark and to isolate increasing quantities of taxol. By 1969, of crude extract had been isolated from almost of bark, although this ultimately yielded only of pure material, but for several years, no use was made of the compound by the NCI. In 1975, it was shown to be active in another &quot;in vitro&quot; system; two years later, a new department head reviewed the data and finally recommended taxol be moved on to the next stage in the discovery process. This required increasing quantities of purified taxol, up to , and in 1977 a further request for of bark was made.

In 1978, two NCI researchers published a report showing that taxol was mildly effective in leukaemic mice. In November 1978, taxol was shown to be effective in xenograft studies. Meanwhile, taxol began to be well known in the cell biology, as well as the cancer communities, with a publication in early 1979 by Susan B. Horwitz, a molecular pharmacologist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, showing that taxol had a previously unknown mechanism of action involving the stabilization of microtubules. Together with formulation problems, this increased interest from researchers meant that, by 1980, the NCI envisaged needing to collect of bark. Animal toxicology studies were completed by June 1982, and in November, the NCI applied for the IND necessary to begin clinical trials in humans.

===Early clinical trials, supply and the transfer to BMS===
Phase I clinical trials began in April 1984, and the decision to start Phase II trials was made a year later. These larger trials needed more bark and collection of a further 12,000 pounds was commissioned, which enabled some phase II trials to begin by the end of 1986. But by then it was recognized that the demand for taxol might be substantial and that more than 60,000 pounds of bark might be needed as a minimum. This unprecedentedly large amount brought ecological concerns about the impact on yew populations into focus for the first time, as local politicians and foresters expressed unease at the program.

The first public report from a phase II trial in May 1988 showed promising effects in melanoma and refractory ovarian cancer. At this point, Gordon Cragg of the NCI&#x27;s Natural Product Branch calculated the synthesis of enough taxol to treat all the ovarian cancer and melanoma cases in the US would require the destruction of 360,000 trees annually. For the first time, serious consideration was given to the problem of supply.
Because of the practical and, in particular, the financial scale of the program needed, the NCI decided to seek association with a pharmaceutical company, and in August 1989, it published a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) offering its current stock and supply from current bark stocks, and proprietary access to the data so far collected, to a company willing to commit to providing the funds to collect further raw material, isolate taxol, and fund a large proportion of clinical trials. In the words of Goodman and Welsh, authors of a substantial scholarly book on taxol, &quot;The NCI was thinking, not of collaboration, ... but of a hand-over of taxol (and its problems)&quot;.

Although the offer was widely advertised, only four companies responded to the CRADA, including the American firm Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS),
which was selected as the partner in December 1989. The choice of BMS later became controversial and was the subject of Congressional hearings in 1991 and 1992. While it seems clear the NCI had little choice but to seek a commercial partner, there was also controversy about the terms of the deal, eventually leading to a report by the General Accounting Office in 2003, which concluded the NIH had failed to ensure value for money. In related CRADAs with the USDA and Department of the Interior, Bristol-Myers Squibb was given exclusive first refusal on all Federal supplies of &quot;Taxus brevifolia&quot;.
This exclusive contract lead to some criticism for giving BMS a &quot;cancer monopoly&quot;.
Eighteen months after the CRADA, BMS filed a new drug application (NDA), which was given FDA approval at the very end of 1992.

Although there was no patent on the compound, the provisions of the Waxman-Hatch Act gave Bristol-Myers Squibb five years exclusive marketing rights.

In 1990, BMS applied to trademark the name taxol as &quot;Taxol(R)&quot;. This was controversially approved in 1992. At the same time, paclitaxel replaced taxol as the generic (INN) name of the compound. Critics, including the journal &quot;Nature&quot;, argued the name taxol had been used for more than two decades and in more than 600 scientific articles and suggested the trademark should not have been awarded and the BMS should renounce its rights to it. BMS argued changing the name would cause confusion among oncologists and possibly endanger the health of patients. BMS has continued to defend its rights to the name in the courts.
BMS has also been criticized for misrepresentation by Goodman and Walsh, who quote from a company report saying &quot;It was not until 1971 that ... testing ... enabled the isolation of paclitaxel, initially described as &#x27;compound 17&quot;. This quote is, strictly speaking, accurate: the objection seems to be that this misleadingly neglects to explain that it was the scientist doing the isolation who named the compound taxol and it was not referred to in any other way for more than twenty years. Annual sales peaked in 2000, reaching US$1.6 billion; paclitaxel is now available in generic form.

== Society and culture ==

=== Legal status ===
Paclitaxel was approved for medical use in the European Union in 2008.

In November 2023, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Naveruclif, intended for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and non-small cell lung cancer. The applicant for this medicinal product is Accord Healthcare S.L.U. Naveruclif was approved for medical use in the European Union in January 2024.

In May 2024, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Apexelsin, intended for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and non-small cell lung cancer. The applicant for this medicinal product is WhiteOak Pharmaceutical B.V. Apexelsin was approved for medical use in the European Union in July 2024.

=== Economics ===
, the cost to the NHS per patient in early breast cancer, assuming four cycles of treatment, was about £4,000 (approx. $6,000).

==Research==
Caffeine has been speculated to inhibit paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells.

In 2016, &quot;in vitro&quot; multi-drug resistant mouse tumor cells were treated with paclitaxel encased in exosomes. Doses 98% less than common dosing had the same effect. Also, dye-marked exosomes were able to mark tumor cells, potentially aiding in diagnosis.

Aside from its direct clinical use, paclitaxel is also used extensively in biological and biomedical research as a microtubule stabilizer. In general, &quot;in vitro&quot; assays involving microtubules, such as motility assays, rely on paclitaxel to maintain microtubule integrity in the absence of the various nucleating factors and other stabilizing elements found in the cell. For example, it is used for &quot;in vitro&quot; tests of drugs that aim to alter the behavior of microtubule motor proteins, or for studies of mutant motor proteins.

Paclitaxel has also been used &quot;in vitro&quot; to inhibit insulin fibrillation. In a molar ratio of 10:1 (insulin:paclitaxel), it hindered insulin fibrillation near 70%. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) findings indicated a spontaneous tendency of paclitaxel to interact with insulin through hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces. The inhibitory role of paclitaxel is attributed to its impact on the colloidal stability of protein solution, as it was observed that paclitaxel inhibited lysozyme fibrillation by inducing the formation of &quot;off-pathway&quot; oligomeric intermediates, subsequently increasing the colloidal stability.

Paclitaxel is sometimes used for &quot;in vivo&quot; studies as well. It can be fed to test organisms, such as fruit flies, or injected into individual cells, to inhibit microtubule disassembly or to increase the number of microtubules in the cell. Paclitaxel induces remyelination in a demyelinating mouse &quot;in vivo&quot; and inhibits human peptidylarginine deiminase 2 (hPAD2) &quot;in vitro&quot; though its methyl ester side chain. In 1999, Angiotech Pharmaceuticals Inc. began phase II clinical trials of micellar paclitaxel as treatment for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, but reported in 2002 that the results showed no statistical significance.

<text>In philosophy, Occam&#x27;s razor (also spelled Ockham&#x27;s razor or Ocham&#x27;s razor; ) is the problem-solving principle that recommends searching for explanations constructed with the smallest possible set of elements. It is also known as the principle of parsimony or the law of parsimony (). Attributed to William of Ockham, a 14th-century English philosopher and theologian, it is frequently cited as , which translates as &quot;Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity&quot;, although Occam never used these exact words. Popularly, the principle is sometimes paraphrased as &quot;of two competing theories, the simpler explanation of an entity is to be preferred.&quot;

This philosophical razor advocates that when presented with competing hypotheses about the same prediction and both hypotheses have equal explanatory power, one should prefer the hypothesis that requires the fewest assumptions, and that this is not meant to be a way of choosing between hypotheses that make different predictions. Similarly, in science, Occam&#x27;s razor is used as an abductive heuristic in the development of theoretical models rather than as a rigorous arbiter between candidate models.

== History ==
The phrase &quot;Occam&#x27;s razor&quot; did not appear until a few centuries after William of Ockham&#x27;s death in 1347. Libert Froidmont, in his &quot;On Christian Philosophy of the Soul&quot;, gives him credit for the phrase, speaking of &quot;novacula occami&quot;. Ockham did not invent this principle, but its fame—and its association with him—may be due to the frequency and effectiveness with which he used it. Ockham stated the principle in various ways, but the most popular version, &quot;Entities are not to be multiplied without necessity&quot; () was formulated by the Irish Franciscan philosopher John Punch in his 1639 commentary on the works of Duns Scotus.

=== Formulations before William of Ockham ===
The origins of what has come to be known as Occam&#x27;s razor are traceable to the works of earlier philosophers such as John Duns Scotus (1265–1308), Robert Grosseteste (1175–1253), Maimonides (Moses ben-Maimon, 1138–1204), and even Aristotle (384–322 BC). Aristotle writes in his &quot;Posterior Analytics&quot;, &quot;We may assume the superiority [other things being equal] of the demonstration which derives from fewer postulates or hypotheses.&quot; Ptolemy () stated, &quot;We consider it a good principle to explain the phenomena by the simplest hypothesis possible.&quot;

Phrases such as &quot;It is vain to do with more what can be done with fewer&quot; and &quot;A plurality is not to be posited without necessity&quot; were commonplace in 13th-century scholastic writing. Robert Grosseteste, in &quot;Commentary on&quot; [Aristotle&#x27;s] &quot;the Posterior Analytics Books&quot; (&quot;Commentarius in Posteriorum Analyticorum Libros&quot;) (), declares: &quot;That is better and more valuable which requires fewer, other circumstances being equal... For if one thing were demonstrated from many and another thing from fewer equally known premises, clearly that is better which is from fewer because it makes us know quickly, just as a universal demonstration is better than particular because it produces knowledge from fewer premises. Similarly in natural science, in moral science, and in metaphysics the best is that which needs no premises and the better that which needs the fewer, other circumstances being equal.&quot;

The &quot;Summa Theologica&quot; of Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) states that &quot;it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many.&quot; Aquinas uses this principle to construct an objection to God&#x27;s existence, an objection that he in turn answers and refutes generally (cf. &quot;quinque viae&quot;), and specifically, through an argument based on causality. Hence, Aquinas acknowledges the principle that today is known as Occam&#x27;s razor, but prefers causal explanations to other simple explanations (cf. also Correlation does not imply causation).

=== William of Ockham ===

William of Ockham (&quot;circa&quot; 1287–1347) was an English Franciscan friar and theologian, an influential medieval philosopher and a nominalist. His popular fame as a great logician rests chiefly on the maxim attributed to him and known as Occam&#x27;s razor. The term &quot;razor&quot; refers to distinguishing between two hypotheses either by &quot;shaving away&quot; unnecessary assumptions or cutting apart two similar conclusions.

While it has been claimed that Occam&#x27;s razor is not found in any of William&#x27;s writings, one can cite statements such as (&quot;Plurality must never be posited without necessity&quot;), which occurs in his theological work on the &quot;Sentences of Peter Lombard&quot; (&quot;Quaestiones et decisiones in quattuor libros Sententiarum Petri Lombardi&quot;; ed. Lugd., 1495, i, dist. 27, qu. 2, K).

Nevertheless, the precise words sometimes attributed to William of Ockham, (Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity), are absent in his extant works; this particular phrasing comes from John Punch, who described the principle as a &quot;common axiom&quot; (&quot;axioma vulgare&quot;) of the Scholastics. William of Ockham himself seems to restrict the operation of this principle in matters pertaining to miracles and God&#x27;s power, considering a plurality of miracles possible in the Eucharist simply because it pleases God.

This principle is sometimes phrased as (&quot;Plurality should not be posited without necessity&quot;). In his &quot;Summa Totius Logicae&quot;, i. 12, William of Ockham cites the principle of economy, (&quot;It is futile to do with more things that which can be done with fewer&quot;; Thorburn, 1918, pp. 352–53; Kneale and Kneale, 1962, p. 243.)

=== Later formulations ===
To quote Isaac Newton, &quot;We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances. Therefore, to the same natural effects we must, as far as possible, assign the same causes.&quot;
In the sentence hypotheses non fingo, Newton affirms the success of this approach.

Bertrand Russell offers a particular version of Occam&#x27;s razor: &quot;Whenever possible, substitute constructions out of known entities for inferences to unknown entities.&quot;

Around 1960, Ray Solomonoff founded the theory of universal inductive inference, the theory of prediction based on observationsfor example, predicting the next symbol based upon a given series of symbols. The only assumption is that the environment follows some unknown but computable probability distribution. This theory is a mathematical formalization of Occam&#x27;s razor.

Another technical approach to Occam&#x27;s razor is ontological parsimony. Parsimony means spareness and is also referred to as the Rule of Simplicity. This is considered a strong version of Occam&#x27;s razor. A variation used in medicine is called the &quot;Zebra&quot;: a physician should reject an exotic medical diagnosis when a more commonplace explanation is more likely, derived from Theodore Woodward&#x27;s dictum &quot;When you hear hoofbeats, think of horses not zebras&quot;.

Ernst Mach formulated the stronger version of Occam&#x27;s razor into physics, which he called the Principle of Economy stating: &quot;Scientists must use the simplest means of arriving at their results and exclude everything not perceived by the senses.&quot;

This principle goes back at least as far as Aristotle, who wrote &quot;Nature operates in the shortest way possible.&quot; The idea of parsimony or simplicity in deciding between theories, though not the intent of the original expression of Occam&#x27;s razor, has been assimilated into common culture as the widespread layman&#x27;s formulation that &quot;the simplest explanation is usually the correct one.&quot;

== Justifications ==

=== Aesthetic ===
Prior to the 20th century, it was a commonly held belief that nature itself was simple and that simpler hypotheses about nature were thus more likely to be true. Thomas Aquinas made this argument in the 13th century, writing, &quot;If a thing can be done adequately by means of one, it is superfluous to do it by means of several; for we observe that nature does not employ two instruments [if] one suffices.&quot;

Beginning in the 20th century, epistemological justifications based on induction, logic, pragmatism, and especially probability theory have become more popular among philosophers.

=== Empirical ===
Occam&#x27;s razor has gained strong empirical support in helping to converge on better theories (see Uses section below for some examples).

In the related concept of overfitting, excessively complex models are affected by statistical noise (a problem also known as the bias–variance tradeoff), whereas simpler models may capture the underlying structure better and may thus have better predictive performance. It is, however, often difficult to deduce which part of the data is noise (cf. model selection, test set, minimum description length, Bayesian inference, etc.).

==== Testing the razor ====

The razor&#x27;s statement that &quot;other things being equal, simpler explanations are generally better than more complex ones&quot; is amenable to empirical testing. Another interpretation of the razor&#x27;s statement would be that &quot;simpler hypotheses are generally better than the complex ones&quot;. The procedure to test the former interpretation would compare the track records of simple and comparatively complex explanations. If one accepts the first interpretation, the validity of Occam&#x27;s razor as a tool would then have to be rejected if the more complex explanations were more often correct than the less complex ones (while the converse would lend support to its use). If the latter interpretation is accepted, the validity of Occam&#x27;s razor as a tool could possibly be accepted if the simpler hypotheses led to correct conclusions more often than not.

Even if some increases in complexity are sometimes necessary, there still remains a justified general bias toward the simpler of two competing explanations. To understand why, consider that for each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there is always an infinite number of possible, more complex, and ultimately incorrect, alternatives. This is so because one can always burden a failing explanation with an ad hoc hypothesis. Ad hoc hypotheses are justifications that prevent theories from being falsified.

For example, if a man, accused of breaking a vase, makes supernatural claims that leprechauns were responsible for the breakage, a simple explanation might be that the man did it, but ongoing ad hoc justifications (e.g., &quot;... and that&#x27;s not me breaking it on the film; they tampered with that, too&quot;) could successfully prevent complete disproof. This endless supply of elaborate competing explanations, called saving hypotheses, cannot be technically ruled out – except by using Occam&#x27;s razor.

Any more complex theory might still possibly be true. A study of the predictive validity of Occam&#x27;s razor found 32 published papers that included 97 comparisons of economic forecasts from simple and complex forecasting methods. None of the papers provided a balance of evidence that complexity of method improved forecast accuracy. In the 25 papers with quantitative comparisons, complexity increased forecast errors by an average of 27 percent.

=== Practical considerations and pragmatism ===
=== Mathematical ===
One justification of Occam&#x27;s razor is a direct result of basic probability theory. By definition, all assumptions introduce possibilities for error; if an assumption does not improve the accuracy of a theory, its only effect is to increase the probability that the overall theory is wrong.

There have also been other attempts to derive Occam&#x27;s razor from probability theory, including notable attempts made by Harold Jeffreys and E. T. Jaynes. The probabilistic (Bayesian) basis for Occam&#x27;s razor is elaborated by David J. C. MacKay in chapter 28 of his book &quot;Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms&quot;, where he emphasizes that a prior bias in favor of simpler models is not required.

William H. Jefferys and James O. Berger (1991) generalize and quantify the original formulation&#x27;s &quot;assumptions&quot; concept as the degree to which a proposition is unnecessarily accommodating to possible observable data. They state, &quot;A hypothesis with fewer adjustable parameters will automatically have an enhanced posterior probability, due to the fact that the predictions it makes are sharp.&quot; The use of &quot;sharp&quot; here is not only a tongue-in-cheek reference to the idea of a razor, but also indicates that such predictions are more accurate than competing predictions. The model they propose balances the precision of a theory&#x27;s predictions against their sharpness, preferring theories that sharply make correct predictions over theories that accommodate a wide range of other possible results. This, again, reflects the mathematical relationship between key concepts in Bayesian inference (namely marginal probability, conditional probability, and posterior probability).

The bias–variance tradeoff is a framework that incorporates the Occam&#x27;s razor principle in its balance between overfitting (associated with lower bias but higher variance) and underfitting (associated with lower variance but higher bias).

=== Other philosophers ===

==== Karl Popper ====
Karl Popper argues that a preference for simple theories need not appeal to practical or aesthetic considerations. Our preference for simplicity may be justified by its falsifiability criterion: we prefer simpler theories to more complex ones &quot;because their empirical content is greater; and because they are better testable&quot;. The idea here is that a simple theory applies to more cases than a more complex one, and is thus more easily falsifiable. This is again comparing a simple theory to a more complex theory where both explain the data equally well.

==== Elliott Sober ====
The philosopher of science Elliott Sober once argued along the same lines as Popper, tying simplicity with &quot;informativeness&quot;: The simplest theory is the more informative, in the sense that it requires less information to a question. He has since rejected this account of simplicity, purportedly because it fails to provide an epistemic justification for simplicity. He now believes that simplicity considerations (and considerations of parsimony in particular) do not count unless they reflect something more fundamental. Philosophers, he suggests, may have made the error of hypostatizing simplicity (i.e., endowed it with a &quot;sui generis&quot; existence), when it has meaning only when embedded in a specific context (Sober 1992). If we fail to justify simplicity considerations on the basis of the context in which we use them, we may have no non-circular justification: &quot;Just as the question &#x27;why be rational?&#x27; may have no non-circular answer, the same may be true of the question &#x27;why should simplicity be considered in evaluating the plausibility of hypotheses?

==== Richard Swinburne ====

Richard Swinburne argues for simplicity on logical grounds:

According to Swinburne, since our choice of theory cannot be determined by data (see Underdetermination and Duhem–Quine thesis), we must rely on some criterion to determine which theory to use. Since it is absurd to have no logical method for settling on one hypothesis amongst an infinite number of equally data-compliant hypotheses, we should choose the simplest theory: &quot;Either science is irrational [in the way it judges theories and predictions probable] or the principle of simplicity is a fundamental synthetic a priori truth.&quot;

==== Ludwig Wittgenstein ====
From the &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot;:
* 3.328 &quot;If a sign is not necessary then it is meaningless. That is the meaning of Occam&#x27;s Razor.&quot;
: (If everything in the symbolism works as though a sign had meaning, then it has meaning.)
* 4.04 &quot;In the proposition, there must be exactly as many things distinguishable as there are in the state of affairs, which it represents. They must both possess the same logical (mathematical) multiplicity (cf. Hertz&#x27;s Mechanics, on Dynamic Models).&quot;
* 5.47321 &quot;Occam&#x27;s Razor is, of course, not an arbitrary rule nor one justified by its practical success. It simply says that unnecessary elements in a symbolism mean nothing. Signs which serve one purpose are logically equivalent; signs which serve no purpose are logically meaningless.&quot;
and on the related concept of &quot;simplicity&quot;:
* 6.363 &quot;The procedure of induction consists in accepting as true the simplest law that can be reconciled with our experiences.&quot;

== Uses ==
=== Science and the scientific method ===

In science, Occam&#x27;s razor is used as a heuristic to guide scientists in developing theoretical models rather than as an arbiter between published models. In physics, parsimony was an important heuristic in the development and application of the principle of least action by Pierre Louis Maupertuis and Leonhard Euler, in Albert Einstein&#x27;s formulation of special relativity, and in the development of quantum mechanics by Max Planck, Werner Heisenberg and Louis de Broglie.

In chemistry, Occam&#x27;s razor is often an important heuristic when developing a model of a reaction mechanism. Although it is useful as a heuristic in developing models of reaction mechanisms, it has been shown to fail as a criterion for selecting among some selected published models. In this context, Einstein himself expressed caution when he formulated Einstein&#x27;s Constraint: &quot;It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.&quot; An often-quoted version of this constraint (which cannot be verified as posited by Einstein himself) reduces this to &quot;Everything should be kept as simple as possible, but not simpler.&quot;

In the scientific method, Occam&#x27;s razor is not considered an irrefutable principle of logic or a scientific result; the preference for simplicity in the scientific method is based on the falsifiability criterion. For each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there may be an extremely large, perhaps even incomprehensible, number of possible and more complex alternatives. Since failing explanations can always be burdened with &quot;ad hoc&quot; hypotheses to prevent them from being falsified, simpler theories are preferable to more complex ones because they tend to be more testable. As a logical principle, Occam&#x27;s razor would demand that scientists accept the simplest possible theoretical explanation for existing data. However, science has shown repeatedly that future data often support more complex theories than do existing data. Science prefers the simplest explanation that is consistent with the data available at a given time, but the simplest explanation may be ruled out as new data become available. That is, science is open to the possibility that future experiments might support more complex theories than demanded by current data and is more interested in designing experiments to discriminate between competing theories than favoring one theory over another based merely on philosophical principles.

When scientists use the idea of parsimony, it has meaning only in a very specific context of inquiry. Several background assumptions are required for parsimony to connect with plausibility in a particular research problem. The reasonableness of parsimony in one research context may have nothing to do with its reasonableness in another. It is a mistake to think that there is a single global principle that spans diverse subject matter.

It has been suggested that Occam&#x27;s razor is a widely accepted example of extraevidential consideration, even though it is entirely a metaphysical assumption. Most of the time, however, Occam&#x27;s razor is a conservative tool, cutting out &quot;crazy, complicated constructions&quot; and assuring &quot;that hypotheses are grounded in the science of the day&quot;, thus yielding &quot;normal&quot; science: models of explanation and prediction. There are, however, notable exceptions where Occam&#x27;s razor turns a conservative scientist into a reluctant revolutionary. For example, Max Planck interpolated between the Wien and Jeans radiation laws and used Occam&#x27;s razor logic to formulate the quantum hypothesis, even resisting that hypothesis as it became more obvious that it was correct.

Appeals to simplicity were used to argue against the phenomena of meteorites, ball lightning, continental drift, and reverse transcriptase. One can argue for atomic building blocks for matter, because it provides a simpler explanation for the observed reversibility of both and chemical reactions as simple separation and rearrangements of atomic building blocks. At the time, however, the atomic theory was considered more complex because it implied the existence of invisible particles that had not been directly detected. Ernst Mach and the logical positivists rejected John Dalton&#x27;s atomic theory until the reality of atoms was more evident in Brownian motion, as shown by Albert Einstein.

In the same way, postulating the aether is more complex than transmission of light through a vacuum. At the time, however, all known waves propagated through a physical medium, and it seemed simpler to postulate the existence of a medium than to theorize about wave propagation without a medium. Likewise, Isaac Newton&#x27;s idea of light particles seemed simpler than Christiaan Huygens&#x27;s idea of waves, so many favored it. In this case, as it turned out, neither the wave—nor the particle—explanation alone suffices, as light behaves like waves and like particles.

Three axioms presupposed by the scientific method are realism (the existence of objective reality), the existence of natural laws, and the constancy of natural law. Rather than depend on provability of these axioms, science depends on the fact that they have not been objectively falsified. Occam&#x27;s razor and parsimony support, but do not prove, these axioms of science. The general principle of science is that theories (or models) of natural law must be consistent with repeatable experimental observations. This ultimate arbiter (selection criterion) rests upon the axioms mentioned above.

If multiple models of natural law make exactly the same testable predictions, they are equivalent and there is no need for parsimony to choose a preferred one. For example, Newtonian, Hamiltonian and Lagrangian classical mechanics are equivalent. Physicists have no interest in using Occam&#x27;s razor to say the other two are wrong. Likewise, there is no demand for simplicity principles to arbitrate between wave and matrix formulations of quantum mechanics. Science often does not demand arbitration or selection criteria between models that make the same testable predictions.

=== Biology ===

Biologists or philosophers of biology use Occam&#x27;s razor in either of two contexts both in evolutionary biology: the units of selection controversy and systematics. George C. Williams in his book &quot;Adaptation and Natural Selection&quot; (1966) argues that the best way to explain altruism among animals is based on low-level (i.e., individual) selection as opposed to high-level group selection. Altruism is defined by some evolutionary biologists (e.g., R. Alexander, 1987; W. D. Hamilton, 1964) as behavior that is beneficial to others (or to the group) at a cost to the individual, and many posit individual selection as the mechanism that explains altruism solely in terms of the behaviors of individual organisms acting in their own self-interest (or in the interest of their genes, via kin selection). Williams was arguing against the perspective of others who propose selection at the level of the group as an evolutionary mechanism that selects for altruistic traits (e.g., D. S. Wilson &amp; E. O. Wilson, 2007). The basis for Williams&#x27;s contention is that of the two, individual selection is the more parsimonious theory. In doing so he is invoking a variant of Occam&#x27;s razor known as Morgan&#x27;s Canon: &quot;In no case is an animal activity to be interpreted in terms of higher psychological processes, if it can be fairly interpreted in terms of processes which stand lower in the scale of psychological evolution and development.&quot; (Morgan 1903).

However, more recent biological analyses, such as Richard Dawkins&#x27;s &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;, have contended that Morgan&#x27;s Canon is not the simplest and most basic explanation. Dawkins argues the way evolution works is that the genes propagated in most copies end up determining the development of that particular species, i.e., natural selection turns out to select specific genes, and this is really the fundamental underlying principle that automatically gives individual and group selection as emergent features of evolution.

Zoology provides an example. Muskoxen, when threatened by wolves, form a circle with the males on the outside and the females and young on the inside. This is an example of a behavior by the males that seems to be altruistic. The behavior is disadvantageous to them individually but beneficial to the group as a whole; thus, it was seen by some to support the group selection theory. Another interpretation is kin selection: if the males are protecting their offspring, they are protecting copies of their own alleles. Engaging in this behavior would be favored by individual selection if the cost to the male musk ox is less than half of the benefit received by his calf – which could easily be the case if wolves have an easier time killing calves than adult males. It could also be the case that male musk oxen would be individually less likely to be killed by wolves if they stood in a circle with their horns pointing out, regardless of whether they were protecting the females and offspring. That would be an example of regular natural selection – a phenomenon called &quot;the selfish herd&quot;.

Systematics is the branch of biology that attempts to establish patterns of relationship among biological taxa, today generally thought to reflect evolutionary history. It is also concerned with their classification. There are three primary camps in systematics: cladists, pheneticists, and evolutionary taxonomists. Cladists hold that classification should be based on synapomorphies (shared, derived character states), pheneticists contend that overall similarity (synapomorphies and complementary symplesiomorphies) is the determining criterion, while evolutionary taxonomists say that both genealogy and similarity count in classification (in a manner determined by the evolutionary taxonomist).

It is among the cladists that Occam&#x27;s razor is applied, through the method of &quot;cladistic parsimony&quot;. Cladistic parsimony (or maximum parsimony) is a method of phylogenetic inference that yields phylogenetic trees (more specifically, cladograms). Cladograms are branching, diagrams used to represent hypotheses of relative degree of relationship, based on synapomorphies. Cladistic parsimony is used to select as the preferred hypothesis of relationships the cladogram that requires the fewest implied character state transformations (or smallest weight, if characters are differentially weighted). Critics of the cladistic approach often observe that for some types of data, parsimony could produce the wrong results, regardless of how much data is collected (this is called statistical inconsistency, or long branch attraction). However, this criticism is also potentially true for any type of phylogenetic inference, unless the model used to estimate the tree reflects the way that evolution actually happened. Because this information is not empirically accessible, the criticism of statistical inconsistency against parsimony holds no force. For a book-length treatment of cladistic parsimony, see Elliott Sober&#x27;s &quot;Reconstructing the Past: Parsimony, Evolution, and Inference&quot; (1988). For a discussion of both uses of Occam&#x27;s razor in biology, see Sober&#x27;s article &quot;Let&#x27;s Razor Ockham&#x27;s Razor&quot; (1990).

Other methods for inferring evolutionary relationships use parsimony in a more general way. Likelihood methods for phylogeny use parsimony as they do for all likelihood tests, with hypotheses requiring fewer differing parameters (i.e., numbers or different rates of character change or different frequencies of character state transitions) being treated as null hypotheses relative to hypotheses requiring more differing parameters. Thus, complex hypotheses must predict data much better than do simple hypotheses before researchers reject the simple hypotheses. Recent advances employ information theory, a close cousin of likelihood, which uses Occam&#x27;s razor in the same way. The choice of the &quot;shortest tree&quot; relative to a not-so-short tree under any optimality criterion (smallest distance, fewest steps, or maximum likelihood) is always based on parsimony.

Francis Crick has commented on potential limitations of Occam&#x27;s razor in biology. He advances the argument that because biological systems are the products of (an ongoing) natural selection, the mechanisms are not necessarily optimal in an obvious sense. He cautions: &quot;While Ockham&#x27;s razor is a useful tool in the physical sciences, it can be a very dangerous implement in biology. It is thus very rash to use simplicity and elegance as a guide in biological research.&quot; This is an ontological critique of parsimony.

In biogeography, parsimony is used to infer ancient vicariant events or migrations of species or populations by observing the geographic distribution and relationships of existing organisms. Given the phylogenetic tree, ancestral population subdivisions are inferred to be those that require the minimum amount of change.

=== Religion ===
In the philosophy of religion, Occam&#x27;s razor is sometimes applied to the existence of God. William of Ockham himself was a Christian. He believed in God, and in the authority of Christian scripture; he writes that &quot;nothing ought to be posited without a reason given, unless it is self-evident (literally, known through itself) or known by experience or proved by the authority of Sacred Scripture.&quot; Ockham believed that an explanation has no sufficient basis in reality when it does not harmonize with reason, experience, or the Bible. Unlike many theologians of his time, though, Ockham did not believe God could be logically proven with arguments. To Ockham, science was a matter of discovery; theology was a matter of revelation and faith. He states: &quot;Only faith gives us access to theological truths. The ways of God are not open to reason, for God has freely chosen to create a world and establish a way of salvation within it apart from any necessary laws that human logic or rationality can uncover.&quot;

Thomas Aquinas, in the &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;, uses a formulation of Occam&#x27;s razor to construct an objection to the idea that God exists, which he refutes directly with a counterargument:

Further, it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many. But it seems that everything we see in the world can be accounted for by other principles, supposing God did not exist. For all natural things can be reduced to one principle which is nature; and all voluntary things can be reduced to one principle which is human reason, or will. Therefore there is no need to suppose God&#x27;s existence.

In turn, Aquinas answers this with the &quot;quinque viae&quot;, and addresses the particular objection above with the following answer:

Since nature works for a determinate end under the direction of a higher agent, whatever is done by nature must needs be traced back to God, as to its first cause. So also whatever is done voluntarily must also be traced back to some higher cause other than human reason or will, since these can change or fail; for all things that are changeable and capable of defect must be traced back to an immovable and self-necessary first principle, as was shown in the body of the Article.

Rather than argue for the necessity of a god, some theists base their belief upon grounds independent of, or prior to, reason, making Occam&#x27;s razor irrelevant. This was the stance of Søren Kierkegaard, who viewed belief in God as a leap of faith that sometimes directly opposed reason. This is also the doctrine of Gordon Clark&#x27;s presuppositional apologetics, with the exception that Clark never thought the leap of faith was contrary to reason (see also Fideism).

Various arguments in favor of God establish God as a useful or even necessary assumption. Contrastingly some anti-theists hold firmly to the belief that assuming the existence of God introduces unnecessary complexity (e.g., the Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit from Dawkins&#x27;s &quot;The God Delusion&quot;).

Another application of the principle is to be found in the work of George Berkeley (1685–1753). Berkeley was an idealist who believed that all of reality could be explained in terms of the mind alone. He invoked Occam&#x27;s razor against materialism, stating that matter was not required by his metaphysics and was thus eliminable. One potential problem with this belief is that it&#x27;s possible, given Berkeley&#x27;s position, to find solipsism itself more in line with the razor than a God-mediated world beyond a single thinker.

Occam&#x27;s razor may also be recognized in the apocryphal story about an exchange between Pierre-Simon Laplace and Napoleon. It is said that in praising Laplace for one of his recent publications, the emperor asked how it was that the name of God, which featured so frequently in the writings of Lagrange, appeared nowhere in Laplace&#x27;s. At that, he is said to have replied, &quot;It&#x27;s because I had no need of that hypothesis.&quot; Though some points of this story illustrate Laplace&#x27;s atheism, more careful consideration suggests that he may instead have intended merely to illustrate the power of methodological naturalism, or even simply that the fewer logical premises one assumes, the stronger is one&#x27;s conclusion.

=== Philosophy of mind ===
In his article &quot;Sensations and Brain Processes&quot; (1959), J. J. C. Smart invoked Occam&#x27;s razor with the aim to justify his preference of the mind-brain identity theory over spirit-body dualism. Dualists state that there are two kinds of substances in the universe: physical (including the body) and spiritual, which is non-physical. In contrast, identity theorists state that everything is physical, including consciousness, and that there is nothing nonphysical. Though it is impossible to appreciate the spiritual when limiting oneself to the physical, Smart maintained that identity theory explains all phenomena by assuming only a physical reality. Subsequently, Smart has been severely criticized for his use (or misuse) of Occam&#x27;s razor and ultimately retracted his advocacy of it in this context. Paul Churchland (1984) states that by itself Occam&#x27;s razor is inconclusive regarding duality. In a similar way, Dale Jacquette (1994) stated that Occam&#x27;s razor has been used in attempts to justify eliminativism and reductionism in the philosophy of mind. Eliminativism is the thesis that the ontology of folk psychology including such entities as &quot;pain&quot;, &quot;joy&quot;, &quot;desire&quot;, &quot;fear&quot;, etc., are eliminable in favor of an ontology of a completed neuroscience.

=== Penal ethics ===
In penal theory and the philosophy of punishment, parsimony refers specifically to taking care in the distribution of punishment in order to avoid excessive punishment. In the utilitarian approach to the philosophy of punishment, Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s &quot;parsimony principle&quot; states that any punishment greater than is required to achieve its end is unjust. The concept is related but not identical to the legal concept of proportionality. Parsimony is a key consideration of the modern restorative justice, and is a component of utilitarian approaches to punishment, as well as the prison abolition movement. Bentham believed that true parsimony would require punishment to be individualised to take account of the sensibility of the individual—an individual more sensitive to punishment should be given a proportionately lesser one, since otherwise needless pain would be inflicted. Later utilitarian writers have tended to abandon this idea, in large part due to the impracticality of determining each alleged criminal&#x27;s relative sensitivity to specific punishments.

=== Probability theory and statistics ===
Marcus Hutter&#x27;s universal artificial intelligence builds upon Solomonoff&#x27;s mathematical formalization of the razor to calculate the expected value of an action.

There are various papers in scholarly journals deriving formal versions of Occam&#x27;s razor from probability theory, applying it in statistical inference, and using it to come up with criteria for penalizing complexity in statistical inference. Papers have suggested a connection between Occam&#x27;s razor and Kolmogorov complexity.

One of the problems with the original formulation of the razor is that it only applies to models with the same explanatory power (i.e., it only tells us to prefer the simplest of equally good models). A more general form of the razor can be derived from Bayesian model comparison, which is based on Bayes factors and can be used to compare models that do not fit the observations equally well. These methods can sometimes optimally balance the complexity and power of a model. Generally, the exact Occam factor is intractable, but approximations such as Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, Variational Bayesian methods, false discovery rate, and Laplace&#x27;s method are used. Many artificial intelligence researchers are now employing such techniques, for instance through work on Occam Learning or more generally on the Free energy principle.

Statistical versions of Occam&#x27;s razor have a more rigorous formulation than what philosophical discussions produce. In particular, they must have a specific definition of the term &quot;simplicity&quot;, and that definition can vary. For example, in the Kolmogorov–Chaitin minimum description length approach, the subject must pick a Turing machine whose operations describe the basic operations &quot;believed&quot; to represent &quot;simplicity&quot; by the subject. However, one could always choose a Turing machine with a simple operation that happened to construct one&#x27;s entire theory and would hence score highly under the razor. This has led to two opposing camps: one that believes Occam&#x27;s razor is objective, and one that believes it is subjective.

==== Objective razor ====
The minimum instruction set of a universal Turing machine requires approximately the same length description across different formulations, and is small compared to the Kolmogorov complexity of most practical theories. Marcus Hutter has used this consistency to define a &quot;natural&quot; Turing machine of small size as the proper basis for excluding arbitrarily complex instruction sets in the formulation of razors. Describing the program for the universal program as the &quot;hypothesis&quot;, and the representation of the evidence as program data, it has been formally proven under Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory that &quot;the sum of the log universal probability of the model plus the log of the probability of the data given the model should be minimized.&quot; Interpreting this as minimising the total length of a two-part message encoding model followed by data given model gives us the minimum message length (MML) principle.

One possible conclusion from mixing the concepts of Kolmogorov complexity and Occam&#x27;s razor is that an ideal data compressor would also be a scientific explanation/formulation generator. Some attempts have been made to re-derive known laws from considerations of simplicity or compressibility.

According to Jürgen Schmidhuber, the appropriate mathematical theory of Occam&#x27;s razor already exists, namely, Solomonoff&#x27;s theory of optimal inductive inference and its extensions. See discussions in David L. Dowe&#x27;s &quot;Foreword re C. S. Wallace&quot; for the subtle distinctions between the algorithmic probability work of Solomonoff and the MML work of Chris Wallace, and see Dowe&#x27;s &quot;MML, hybrid Bayesian network graphical models, statistical consistency, invariance and uniqueness&quot; both for such discussions and for (in section 4) discussions of MML and Occam&#x27;s razor. For a specific example of MML as Occam&#x27;s razor in the problem of decision tree induction, see Dowe and Needham&#x27;s &quot;Message Length as an Effective Ockham&#x27;s Razor in Decision Tree Induction&quot;.

==== Mathematical arguments against Occam&#x27;s razor ====

The no free lunch (NFL) theorems for inductive inference prove that Occam&#x27;s razor must rely on ultimately arbitrary assumptions concerning the prior probability distribution found in our world. Specifically, suppose one is given two inductive inference algorithms, A and B, where A is a Bayesian procedure based on the choice of some prior distribution motivated by Occam&#x27;s razor (e.g., the prior might favor hypotheses with smaller Kolmogorov complexity). Suppose that B is the anti-Bayes procedure, which calculates what the Bayesian algorithm A based on Occam&#x27;s razor will predict – and then predicts the exact opposite. Then there are just as many actual priors (including those different from the Occam&#x27;s razor prior assumed by A) in which algorithm B outperforms A as priors in which the procedure A based on Occam&#x27;s razor comes out on top. In particular, the NFL theorems show that the &quot;Occam factors&quot; Bayesian argument for Occam&#x27;s razor must make ultimately arbitrary modeling assumptions.

=== Software development ===
In software development, the rule of least power argues the correct programming language to use is the one that is simplest while also solving the targeted software problem. In that form the rule is often credited to Tim Berners-Lee since it appeared in his design guidelines for the original Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Complexity in this context is measured either by placing a language into the Chomsky hierarchy or by listing idiomatic features of the language and comparing according to some agreed to scale of difficulties between idioms. Many languages once thought to be of lower complexity have evolved or later been discovered to be more complex than originally intended; so, in practice this rule is applied to the relative ease of a programmer to obtain the power of the language, rather than the precise theoretical limits of the language.

=== Artificial Intelligence ===
Scientists have discovered that Deep Neural Networks (DNN) prefer simpler mathematical functions while learning. This simplicity bias enables DNNs to overcome overfitting - a scenario where the model gets overwhelmed with noise due to the presence of too many parameters.

== Controversial aspects ==
Occam&#x27;s razor is not an embargo against the positing of any kind of entity, or a recommendation of the simplest theory come what may. Occam&#x27;s razor is used to adjudicate between theories that have already passed &quot;theoretical scrutiny&quot; tests and are equally well-supported by evidence. Furthermore, it may be used to prioritize empirical testing between two equally plausible but unequally testable hypotheses; thereby minimizing costs and wastes while increasing chances of falsification of the simpler-to-test hypothesis.

Another contentious aspect of the razor is that a theory can become more complex in terms of its structure (or syntax), while its ontology (or semantics) becomes simpler, or vice versa. Quine, in a discussion on definition, referred to these two perspectives as &quot;economy of practical expression&quot; and &quot;economy in grammar and vocabulary&quot;, respectively.

Galileo Galilei lampooned the &quot;misuse&quot; of Occam&#x27;s razor in his &quot;Dialogue&quot;. The principle is represented in the dialogue by Simplicio. The telling point that Galileo presented ironically was that if one really wanted to start from a small number of entities, one could always consider the letters of the alphabet as the fundamental entities, since one could construct the whole of human knowledge out of them.

Instances of using Occam&#x27;s razor to justify belief in less complex and more simple theories have been criticized as using the razor inappropriately. For instance Francis Crick stated that &quot;While Occam&#x27;s razor is a useful tool in the physical sciences, it can be a very dangerous implement in biology. It is thus very rash to use simplicity and elegance as a guide in biological research.&quot;

== Anti-razors ==
Occam&#x27;s razor has met some opposition from people who consider it too extreme or rash. Walter Chatton () was a contemporary of William of Ockham who took exception to Occam&#x27;s razor and Ockham&#x27;s use of it. In response he devised his own &quot;anti-razor&quot;: &quot;If three things are not enough to verify an affirmative proposition about things, a fourth must be added and so on.&quot; Although there have been several philosophers who have formulated similar anti-razors since Chatton&#x27;s time, no one anti-razor has perpetuated as notably as Chatton&#x27;s anti-razor, although this could be the case of the Late Renaissance Italian motto of unknown attribution (&quot;Even if it is not true, it is well conceived&quot;) when referred to a particularly artful explanation.

Anti-razors have also been created by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716), Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), and Karl Menger (1902–1985). Leibniz&#x27;s version took the form of a principle of plenitude, as Arthur Lovejoy has called it: the idea being that God created the most varied and populous of possible worlds. Kant felt a need to moderate the effects of Occam&#x27;s razor and thus created his own counter-razor: &quot;The variety of beings should not rashly be diminished.&quot;

Karl Menger found mathematicians to be too parsimonious with regard to variables so he formulated his Law Against Miserliness, which took one of two forms: &quot;Entities must not be reduced to the point of inadequacy&quot; and &quot;It is vain to do with fewer what requires more.&quot; A less serious but even more extremist anti-razor is &#x27;Pataphysics, the &quot;science of imaginary solutions&quot; developed by Alfred Jarry (1873–1907). Perhaps the ultimate in anti-reductionism, &quot;&#x27;Pataphysics seeks no less than to view each event in the universe as completely unique, subject to no laws but its own.&quot; Variations on this theme were subsequently explored by the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges in his story/mock-essay &quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot;. Physicist R. V. Jones contrived Crabtree&#x27;s Bludgeon, which states that &quot;[n]o set of mutually inconsistent observations can exist for which some human intellect cannot conceive a coherent explanation, however complicated.&quot;

Recently, American physicist Igor Mazin argued that because high-profile physics journals prefer publications offering exotic and unusual interpretations, the Occam&#x27;s razor principle is being replaced by an &quot;Inverse Occam&#x27;s razor&quot;, implying that the simplest possible explanation is usually rejected.

, &quot;The Skeptic&quot; magazine annually awards the Ockham Awards, or simply the Ockhams, named after Occam&#x27;s razor, at QED. The Ockhams were introduced by editor-in-chief Deborah Hyde to &quot;recognise the effort and time that have gone into the community&#x27;s favourite skeptical blogs, skeptical podcasts, skeptical campaigns and outstanding contributors to the skeptical cause.&quot; The trophies, designed by Neil Davies and Karl Derrick, carry the upper text &quot;&quot;Ockham&#x27;s&quot; and the lower text &quot;The Skeptic. Shaving away unnecessary assumptions since 1285.&quot;&quot; Between the texts, there is an image of a double-edged safety razorblade, and both lower corners feature an image of William of Ockham&#x27;s face.

<doc id="36806" wikidata="Q11457" url="?curid=36806" title="Cotton">
<text>Cotton () is a soft, fluffy staple fiber that grows in a , or protective case, around the seeds of the cotton plants of the genus &quot;Gossypium&quot; in the mallow family Malvaceae. The fiber is almost pure cellulose, and can contain minor percentages of waxes, fats, pectins, and water. Under natural conditions, the cotton bolls will increase the dispersal of the seeds.

The plant is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including the Americas, Africa, Egypt and India. The greatest diversity of wild cotton species is found in Mexico, followed by Australia and Africa. Cotton was independently domesticated in the Old and New Worlds.

The fiber is most often spun into yarn or thread and used to make a soft, breathable, and durable textile. The use of cotton for fabric is known to date to prehistoric times; fragments of cotton fabric dated to the fifth millennium BC have been found in the Indus Valley civilization, as well as fabric remnants dated back to 4200 BC in Peru.
Although cultivated since antiquity, it was the invention of the cotton gin that lowered the cost of production and led to its widespread use, and it is the most widely used natural fiber cloth in clothing today.

Current estimates for world production are about 25 million tonnes or 110 million bales annually, accounting for 2.5% of the world&#x27;s arable land. India is the world&#x27;s largest producer of cotton. The United States has been the largest exporter for many years.

==Types==
There are four commercially grown species of cotton, all domesticated in antiquity:
*&quot;Gossypium hirsutum&quot; – upland cotton, native to Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean and southern Florida (90% of world production)
*&quot;Gossypium barbadense&quot; – known as extra-long staple cotton, native to tropical South America (over 5% of world production)
*&quot;Gossypium arboreum&quot; – tree cotton, native to India and Pakistan (less than 2%)
*&quot;Gossypium herbaceum&quot; – Levant cotton, native to southern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula (less than 2%)

Hybrid varieties are also cultivated. The two New World cotton species account for the vast majority of modern cotton production, but the two Old World species were widely used before the 1900s. While cotton fibers occur naturally in colors of white, brown, pink and green, fears of contaminating the genetics of white cotton have led many cotton-growing locations to ban the growing of colored cotton varieties.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;cotton&quot; has Arabic origins, derived from the Arabic word ( or ). This was the usual word for cotton in medieval Arabic. Marco Polo in chapter 2 in his book, describes a province he calls Khotan in Turkestan, today&#x27;s Xinjiang, where cotton was grown in abundance. The word entered the Romance languages in the mid-12th century, and English a century later. Cotton fabric was known to the ancient Romans as an import, but cotton was rare in the Romance-speaking lands until imports from the Arabic-speaking lands in the later medieval era at transformatively lowered prices.

==History==
===Early history===
====South Asia====

The earliest evidence of the use of cotton in the Old World, dated to 5500 BC and preserved in copper beads, has been found at the Neolithic site of Mehrgarh, at the foot of the Bolan Pass in ancient India, today in Balochistan Pakistan. Fragments of cotton textiles have been found at Mohenjo-daro and other sites of the Bronze Age Indus Valley civilization, and cotton may have been an important export from it.

====Americas====
Cotton bolls discovered in a cave near Tehuacán, Mexico, have been
dated to as early as 5500 BC, but this date has been challenged. More securely dated is the domestication of &quot;Gossypium hirsutum&quot; in Mexico between around 3400 and 2300 BC. During this time, people between the Río Santiago and the Río Balsas grew, spun, wove, dyed, and sewed cotton. What they did not use themselves, they sent to their Aztec rulers as tribute, on the scale of ~ annually.

In Peru, cultivation of the indigenous cotton species &quot;Gossypium barbadense&quot; has been dated, from a find in Ancon, to , and was the backbone of the development of coastal cultures such as the Norte Chico, Moche, and Nazca. Cotton was grown upriver, made into nets, and traded with fishing villages along the coast for large supplies of fish. The Spanish who came to Mexico and Peru in the early 16th century found the people growing cotton and wearing clothing made of it.

====Arabia====
The Greeks and the Arabs were not familiar with cotton until the Wars of Alexander the Great, as his contemporary Megasthenes told Seleucus I Nicator of &quot;there being trees on which wool grows&quot; in &quot;Indica.&quot; This may be a reference to &quot;tree cotton&quot;, &quot;Gossypium arboreum,&quot; which is native to the Indian subcontinent.

According to the &quot;Columbia Encyclopedia&quot;:

====Iran====
In Iran (Persia), the history of cotton dates back to the Achaemenid era (5th century BC); however, there are few sources about the planting of cotton in pre-Islamic Iran. Cotton cultivation was common in Merv, Ray and Pars. In Persian poems, especially Ferdowsi&#x27;s Shahname, there are references to cotton (&quot;panbe&quot; in Persian). Marco Polo (13th century) refers to the major products of Persia, including cotton. John Chardin, a French traveler of the 17th century who visited Safavid Persia, spoke approvingly of the vast cotton farms of Persia.

====Kingdom of Kush====
Cotton (&quot;Gossypium herbaceum&quot; Linnaeus) may have been domesticated 5000 BC in eastern Sudan near the Middle Nile Basin region, where cotton cloth was being produced. Around the 4th century BC, the cultivation of cotton and the knowledge of its spinning and weaving in Meroë reached a high level. The export of textiles was one of the sources of wealth for Meroë. Ancient Nubia had a &quot;culture of cotton&quot; of sorts, evidenced by physical evidence of cotton processing tools and the presence of cattle in certain areas. Some researchers propose that cotton was important to the Nubian economy for its use in contact with the neighboring Egyptians. Aksumite King Ezana boasted in his inscription that he destroyed large cotton plantations in Meroë during his conquest of the region.

In the Meroitic Period (beginning 3rd century BCE), many cotton textiles have been recovered, preserved due to favorable arid conditions. Most of these fabric fragments come from Lower Nubia, and the cotton textiles account for 85% of the archaeological textiles from Classic/Late Meroitic sites. Due to these arid conditions, cotton, a plant that usually thrives moderate rainfall and richer soils, requires extra irrigation and labor in Sudanese climate conditions. Therefore, a great deal of resources would have been required, likely restricting its cultivation to the elite. In the first to third centuries CE, recovered cotton fragments all began to mirror the same style and production method, as seen from the direction of spun cotton and technique of weaving. Cotton textiles also appear in places of high regard, such as on funerary stelae and statues.

====China====
During the Han dynasty (207 BC - 220 AD), cotton was grown by Chinese peoples in the southern Chinese province of Yunnan.

===Middle Ages===
====Eastern world====
Egyptians grew and spun cotton in the first seven centuries of the Christian era.

Handheld roller cotton gins had been used in India since the 6th century, and was then introduced to other countries from there. Between the 12th and 14th centuries, dual-roller gins appeared in India and China. The Indian version of the dual-roller gin was prevalent throughout the Mediterranean cotton trade by the 16th century. This mechanical device was, in some areas, driven by water power.

The earliest clear illustrations of the spinning wheel come from the Islamic world in the eleventh century. The earliest unambiguous reference to a spinning wheel in India is dated to 1350, suggesting that the spinning wheel was likely introduced from Iran to India during the Delhi Sultanate.

====Europe====

During the late medieval period, cotton became known as an imported fiber in northern Europe, without any knowledge of how it was derived, other than that it was a plant. Because Herodotus had written in his &quot;Histories&quot;, Book III, 106, that in India trees grew in the wild producing wool, it was assumed that the plant was a tree, rather than a shrub. This aspect is retained in the name for cotton in several Germanic languages, such as German &quot;&quot;, which translates as &quot;tree wool&quot; (&quot;Baum&quot; means &quot;tree&quot;; &quot;Wolle&quot; means &quot;wool&quot;). Noting its similarities to wool, people in the region could only imagine that cotton must be produced by plant-borne sheep. John Mandeville, writing in 1350, stated as fact that &quot;There grew there [India] a wonderful tree which bore tiny lambs on the endes of its branches. These branches were so pliable that they bent down to allow the lambs to feed when they are hungry.&quot; (See Vegetable Lamb of Tartary.)
Cotton manufacture was introduced to Europe during the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula and Sicily. The knowledge of cotton weaving was spread to northern Italy in the 12th century, when Sicily was conquered by the Normans, and consequently to the rest of Europe. The spinning wheel, introduced to Europe circa 1350, improved the speed of cotton spinning. By the 15th century, Venice, Antwerp, and Haarlem were important ports for cotton trade, and the sale and transportation of cotton fabrics had become very profitable.

===Early modern period===
====Mughal India====


Under the Mughal Empire, which ruled in the Indian subcontinent from the early 16th century to the early 18th century, Indian cotton production increased, in terms of both raw cotton and cotton textiles. The Mughals introduced agrarian reforms such as a new revenue system that was biased in favour of higher value cash crops such as cotton and indigo, providing state incentives to grow cash crops, in addition to rising market demand.

The largest manufacturing industry in the Mughal Empire was cotton textile manufacturing, which included the production of piece goods, calicos, and muslins, available unbleached and in a variety of colours. The cotton textile industry was responsible for a large part of the empire&#x27;s international trade. India had a 25% share of the global textile trade in the early 18th century. Indian cotton textiles were the most important manufactured goods in world trade in the 18th century, consumed across the world from the Americas to Japan. The most important center of cotton production was the Bengal Subah province, particularly around its capital city of Dhaka.

The worm gear roller cotton gin, which was invented in India during the early Delhi Sultanate era of the 13th–14th centuries, came into use in the Mughal Empire some time around the 16th century, and is still used in India through to the present day. Another innovation, the incorporation of the crank handle in the cotton gin, first appeared in India some time during the late Delhi Sultanate or the early Mughal Empire. The production of cotton, which may have largely been spun in the villages and then taken to towns in the form of yarn to be woven into cloth textiles, was advanced by the diffusion of the spinning wheel across India shortly before the Mughal era, lowering the costs of yarn and helping to increase demand for cotton. The diffusion of the spinning wheel, and the incorporation of the worm gear and crank handle into the roller cotton gin, led to greatly expanded Indian cotton textile production during the Mughal era.

It was reported that, with an Indian cotton gin, which is half machine and half tool, one man and one woman could clean of cotton per day. With a modified Forbes version, one man and a boy could produce per day. If oxen were used to power 16 of these machines, and a few people&#x27;s labour was used to feed them, they could produce as much work as 750 people did formerly.

====Egypt====
In the early 19th century, a Frenchman named M. Jumel proposed to the great ruler of Egypt, Mohamed Ali Pasha, that he could earn a substantial income by growing an extra-long staple Maho (&quot;Gossypium barbadense&quot;) cotton, in Lower Egypt, for the French market. Mohamed Ali Pasha accepted the proposition and granted himself the monopoly on the sale and export of cotton in Egypt; and later dictated cotton should be grown in preference to other crops.

Egypt under Muhammad Ali in the early 19th century had the fifth most productive cotton industry in the world, in terms of the number of spindles per capita. The industry was initially driven by machinery that relied on traditional energy sources, such as animal power, water wheels, and windmills, which were also the principal energy sources in Western Europe up until around 1870. It was under Muhammad Ali in the early 19th century that steam engines were introduced to the Egyptian cotton industry.

By the time of the American Civil war annual exports had reached $16 million (120,000 bales), which rose to $56 million by 1864, primarily due to the loss of the Confederate supply on the world market. Exports continued to grow even after the reintroduction of US cotton, produced now by a paid workforce, and Egyptian exports reached 1.2 million bales a year by 1903.

===Britain===
====East India Company====


The English East India Company (EIC) introduced the British to cheap calico and chintz cloth on the restoration of the monarchy in the 1660s. Initially imported as a novelty side line, from its spice trading posts in Asia, the cheap colourful cloth proved popular and overtook the EIC&#x27;s spice trade by value in the late 17th century. The EIC embraced the demand, particularly for calico, by expanding its factories in Asia and producing and importing cloth in bulk, creating competition for domestic woollen and linen textile producers. The impacted weavers, spinners, dyers, shepherds and farmers objected and the calico question became one of the major issues of National politics between the 1680s and the 1730s. Parliament began to see a decline in domestic textile sales, and an increase in imported textiles from places like China and India. Seeing the East India Company and their textile importation as a threat to domestic textile businesses, Parliament passed the 1700 Calico Act, blocking the importation of cotton cloth. As there was no punishment for continuing to sell cotton cloth, smuggling of the popular material became commonplace. In 1721, dissatisfied with the results of the first act, Parliament passed a stricter addition, this time prohibiting the sale of most cottons, imported and domestic (exempting only thread Fustian and raw cotton). The exemption of raw cotton from the prohibition initially saw 2 thousand bales of cotton imported annually, to become the basis of a new indigenous industry, initially producing Fustian for the domestic market, though more importantly triggering the development of a series of mechanised spinning and weaving technologies, to process the material. This mechanised production was concentrated in new cotton mills, which slowly expanded until by the beginning of the 1770s seven thousand bales of cotton were imported annually, and pressure was put on Parliament, by the new mill owners, to remove the prohibition on the production and sale of pure cotton cloth, as they could easily compete with anything the EIC could import.

The acts were repealed in 1774, triggering a wave of investment in mill-based cotton spinning and production, doubling the demand for raw cotton within a couple of years, and doubling it again every decade, into the 1840s.

Indian cotton textiles, particularly those from Bengal, continued to maintain a competitive advantage up until the 19th century. In order to compete with India, Britain invested in labour-saving technical progress, while implementing protectionist policies such as bans and tariffs to restrict Indian imports. At the same time, the East India Company&#x27;s rule in India contributed to its deindustrialization, opening up a new market for British goods, while the capital amassed from Bengal after its 1757 conquest was used to invest in British industries such as textile manufacturing and greatly increase British wealth. British colonization also forced open the large Indian market to British goods, which could be sold in India without tariffs or duties, compared to local Indian producers who were heavily taxed, while raw cotton was imported from India without tariffs to British factories which manufactured textiles from Indian cotton, giving Britain a monopoly over India&#x27;s large market and cotton resources. India served as both a significant supplier of raw goods to British manufacturers and a large captive market for British manufactured goods. Britain eventually surpassed India as the world&#x27;s leading cotton textile manufacturer in the 19th century.

India&#x27;s cotton-processing sector changed during EIC expansion in India in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. From focusing on supplying the British market to supplying East Asia with raw cotton. As the Artisan produced textiles were no longer competitive with those produced Industrially, and Europe preferring the cheaper slave produced, long staple American, and Egyptian cottons, for its own materials.

====Industrial Revolution====

The advent of the Industrial Revolution in Britain provided a great boost to cotton manufacture, as textiles emerged as Britain&#x27;s leading export. In 1738, Lewis Paul and John Wyatt, of Birmingham, England, patented the roller spinning machine, as well as the flyer-and-bobbin system for drawing cotton to a more even thickness using two sets of rollers that traveled at different speeds. Later, the invention of the James Hargreaves&#x27; spinning jenny in 1764, Richard Arkwright&#x27;s spinning frame in 1769 and Samuel Crompton&#x27;s spinning mule in 1775 enabled British spinners to produce cotton yarn at much higher rates. From the late 18th century on, the British city of Manchester acquired the nickname &quot;Cottonopolis&quot; due to the cotton industry&#x27;s omnipresence within the city, and Manchester&#x27;s role as the heart of the global cotton trade.

Production capacity in Britain and the United States was improved by the invention of the modern cotton gin by the American Eli Whitney in 1793. Before the development of cotton gins, the cotton fibers had to be pulled from the seeds tediously by hand. By the late 1700s, a number of crude ginning machines had been developed. However, to produce a bale of cotton required over 600 hours of human labor, making large-scale production uneconomical in the United States, even with the use of humans as slave labor. The gin that Whitney manufactured (the Holmes design) reduced the hours down to just a dozen or so per bale. Although Whitney patented his own design for a cotton gin, he manufactured a prior design from Henry Odgen Holmes, for which Holmes filed a patent in 1796. Improving technology and increasing control of world markets allowed British traders to develop a commercial chain in which raw cotton fibers were (at first) purchased from colonial plantations, processed into cotton cloth in the mills of Lancashire, and then exported on British ships to captive colonial markets in West Africa, India, and China (via Shanghai and Hong Kong).

By the 1840s, India was no longer capable of supplying the vast quantities of cotton fibers needed by mechanized British factories, while shipping bulky, low-price cotton from India to Britain was time-consuming and expensive. This, coupled with the emergence of American cotton as a superior type (due to the longer, stronger fibers of the two domesticated native American species, &quot;Gossypium hirsutum&quot; and &quot;Gossypium barbadense&quot;), encouraged British traders to purchase cotton from plantations in the United States and in the Caribbean. By the mid-19th century, &quot;King Cotton&quot; had become the backbone of the southern American economy. In the United States, cultivating and harvesting cotton became the leading occupation of slaves.

During the American Civil War, American cotton exports slumped due to a Union blockade on Southern ports, and because of a strategic decision by the Confederate government to cut exports, hoping to force Britain to recognize the Confederacy or enter the war. The Lancashire Cotton Famine prompted the main purchasers of cotton, Britain and France, to turn to Egyptian cotton. British and French traders invested heavily in cotton plantations. The Egyptian government of Viceroy Isma&#x27;il took out substantial loans from European bankers and stock exchanges. After the American Civil War ended in 1865, British and French traders abandoned Egyptian cotton and returned to cheap American exports, sending Egypt into a deficit spiral that led to the country declaring bankruptcy in 1876, a key factor behind Egypt&#x27;s occupation by the British Empire in 1882.
During this time, cotton cultivation in the British Empire, especially Australia and India, greatly increased to replace the lost production of the American South. Through tariffs and other restrictions, the British government discouraged the production of cotton cloth in India; rather, the raw fiber was sent to England for processing. The Indian Mahatma Gandhi described the process:

#English people buy Indian cotton in the field, picked by Indian labor at seven cents a day, through an optional monopoly.
#This cotton is shipped on British ships, a three-week journey across the Indian Ocean, down the Red Sea, across the Mediterranean, through Gibraltar, across the Bay of Biscay and the Atlantic Ocean to London. One hundred per cent profit on this freight is regarded as small.
#The cotton is turned into cloth in Lancashire. You pay shilling wages instead of Indian pennies to your workers. The English worker not only has the advantage of better wages, but the steel companies of England get the profit of building the factories and machines. Wages; profits; all these are spent in England.
#The finished product is sent back to India at European shipping rates, once again on British ships. The captains, officers, sailors of these ships, whose wages must be paid, are English. The only Indians who profit are a few lascars who do the dirty work on the boats for a few cents a day.
#The cloth is finally sold back to the kings and landlords of India who got the money to buy this expensive cloth out of the poor peasants of India who worked at seven cents a day.

===United States===
In the United States, growing Southern cotton generated significant wealth and capital for the antebellum South, as well as raw material for Northern textile industries. Before 1865 the cotton was largely produced through the labor of enslaved African Americans. It enriched both the Southern landowners and the new textile industries of the Northeastern United States and northwestern Europe. In 1860 the slogan &quot;Cotton is king&quot; characterized the attitude of Southern leaders toward this monocrop in that Europe would support an independent Confederate States of America in 1861 in order to protect the supply of cotton it needed for its very large textile industry.
Russell Griffin of California was a farmer who farmed one of the biggest cotton operations. He produced over sixty thousand bales.
Cotton remained a key crop in the Southern economy after slavery ended in 1865. Across the South, sharecropping evolved, in which landless farmers worked land owned by others in return for a share of the profits. Some farmers rented the land and bore the production costs themselves. Until mechanical cotton pickers were developed, cotton farmers needed additional labor to hand-pick cotton. Picking cotton was a source of income for families across the South. Rural and small town school systems had split vacations so children could work in the fields during &quot;cotton-picking.&quot;

During the middle 20th century, employment in cotton farming fell, as machines began to replace laborers and the South&#x27;s rural labor force dwindled during the World Wars. Cotton remains a major export of the United States, with large farms in California, Arizona and the Deep South. To acknowledge cotton&#x27;s place in the history and heritage of Texas, the Texas Legislature designated cotton the official &quot;State Fiber and Fabric of Texas&quot; in 1997.

===The Moon===
China&#x27;s Chang&#x27;e 4 spacecraft took cotton seeds to the Moon&#x27;s far side. On 15 January 2019, China announced that a cotton seed sprouted, the first &quot;truly otherworldly plant in history&quot;. Inside the Von Kármán Crater, the capsule and seeds sit inside the Chang&#x27;e 4 lander.

==Cultivation==



Successful cultivation of cotton requires a long frost-free period, plenty of sunshine, and a moderate rainfall, usually from . Soils usually need to be fairly heavy, although the level of nutrients does not need to be exceptional. In general, these conditions are met within the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, but a large proportion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in areas with less rainfall that obtain the water from irrigation. Production of the crop for a given year usually starts soon after harvesting the preceding autumn. Cotton is naturally a perennial but is grown as an annual to help control pests. Planting time in spring in the Northern hemisphere varies from the beginning of February to the beginning of June. The area of the United States known as the South Plains is the largest contiguous cotton-growing region in the world. While dryland (non-irrigated) cotton is successfully grown in this region, consistent yields are only produced with heavy reliance on irrigation water drawn from the Ogallala Aquifer. Since cotton is somewhat salt and drought tolerant, this makes it an attractive crop for arid and semiarid regions. As water resources get tighter around the world, economies that rely on it face difficulties and conflict, as well as potential environmental problems. For example, improper cropping and irrigation practices have led to desertification in areas of Uzbekistan, where cotton is a major export. In the days of the Soviet Union, the Aral Sea was tapped for agricultural irrigation, largely of cotton, and now salination is widespread.

Cotton can also be cultivated to have colors other than the yellowish off-white typical of modern commercial cotton fibers. Naturally colored cotton can come in red, green, and several shades of brown.

=== Water footprint ===
The water footprint of cotton fibers is substantially larger than for most other plant fibers. Cotton is also known as a thirsty crop; on average, globally, cotton requires 8,000–10,000 liters of water for one kilogram of cotton, and in dry areas, it may require even more such as in some areas of India, it may need 22,500 liters.

=== Genetic modification ===

Genetically modified (GM) cotton was developed to reduce the heavy reliance on pesticides. The bacterium &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; (Bt) naturally produces a chemical harmful only to a small fraction of insects, most notably the larvae of moths and butterflies, beetles, and flies, and harmless to other forms of life. The gene coding for Bt toxin has been inserted into cotton, causing cotton, called Bt cotton, to produce this natural insecticide in its tissues. In many regions, the main pests in commercial cotton are lepidopteran larvae, which are killed by the Bt protein in the transgenic cotton they eat. This eliminates the need to use large amounts of broad-spectrum insecticides to kill lepidopteran pests (some of which have developed pyrethroid resistance). This spares natural insect predators in the farm ecology and further contributes to noninsecticide pest management.

However, Bt cotton is ineffective against many cotton pests, such as plant bugs, stink bugs, and aphids; depending on circumstances it may still be desirable to use insecticides against these. A 2006 study done by Cornell researchers, the Center for Chinese Agricultural Policy and the Chinese Academy of Science on Bt cotton farming in China found that after seven years these secondary pests that were normally controlled by pesticide had increased, necessitating the use of pesticides at similar levels to non-Bt cotton and causing less profit for farmers because of the extra expense of GM seeds. However, a 2009 study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Stanford University and Rutgers University refuted this. They concluded that the GM cotton effectively controlled bollworm. The secondary pests were mostly miridae (plant bugs) whose increase was related to local temperature and rainfall and only continued to increase in half the villages studied. Moreover, the increase in insecticide use for the control of these secondary insects was far smaller than the reduction in total insecticide use due to Bt cotton adoption. A 2012 Chinese study concluded that Bt cotton halved the use of pesticides and doubled the level of ladybirds, lacewings and spiders. The International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA) said that, worldwide, GM cotton was planted on an area of 25 million hectares in 2011. This was 69% of the worldwide total area planted in cotton.

GM cotton acreage in India grew at a rapid rate, increasing from 50,000 hectares in 2002 to 10.6 million hectares in 2011. The total cotton area in India was 12.1 million hectares in 2011, so GM cotton was grown on 88% of the cotton area. This made India the country with the largest area of GM cotton in the world. A long-term study on the economic impacts of Bt cotton in India, published in the Journal PNAS in 2012, showed that Bt cotton has increased yields, profits, and living standards of smallholder farmers. The U.S. GM cotton crop was 4.0 million hectares in 2011 the second largest area in the world, the Chinese GM cotton crop was third largest by area with 3.9 million hectares and Pakistan had the fourth largest GM cotton crop area of 2.6 million hectares in 2011. The initial introduction of GM cotton proved to be a success in Australia – the yields were equivalent to the non-transgenic varieties and the crop used much less pesticide to produce (85% reduction). The subsequent introduction of a second variety of GM cotton led to increases in GM cotton production until 95% of the Australian cotton crop was GM in 2009 making Australia the country with the fifth largest GM cotton crop in the world. Other GM cotton growing countries in 2011 were Argentina, Myanmar, Burkina Faso, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, South Africa and Costa Rica.

Cotton has been genetically modified for resistance to glyphosate a broad-spectrum herbicide discovered by Monsanto which also sells some of the Bt cotton seeds to farmers. There are also a number of other cotton seed companies selling GM cotton around the world. About 62% of the GM cotton grown from 1996 to 2011 was insect resistant, 24% stacked product and 14% herbicide resistant.

Cotton has gossypol, a toxin that makes it inedible. However, scientists have silenced the gene that produces the toxin, making it a potential food crop. On 17 October 2018, the USDA deregulated GE low-gossypol cotton.

===Organic production===
Organic cotton is generally understood as cotton from plants not genetically modified and that is certified to be grown without the use of any synthetic agricultural chemicals, such as fertilizers or pesticides. Its production also promotes and enhances biodiversity and biological cycles. In the United States, organic cotton plantations are required to enforce the National Organic Program (NOP). This institution determines the allowed practices for pest control, growing, fertilizing, and handling of organic crops. As of 2007, 265,517 bales of organic cotton were produced in 24 countries, and worldwide production was growing at a rate of more than 50% per year. Organic cotton products are now available for purchase at limited locations. These are popular for baby clothes and diapers; natural cotton products are known to be both sustainable and hypoallergenic.

===Pests and weeds===

The cotton industry relies heavily on chemicals, such as fertilizers, insecticides and herbicides, although a very small number of farmers are moving toward an organic model of production. Under most definitions, organic products do not use transgenic &quot;Bt&quot; cotton which contains a bacterial gene that codes for a plant-produced protein that is toxic to a number of pests especially the bollworms. For most producers, &quot;Bt&quot; cotton has allowed a substantial reduction in the use of synthetic insecticides, although in the long term resistance may become problematic.

====Global pest problems====

Significant global pests of cotton include various species of bollworm, such as &quot;Pectinophora gossypiella&quot;. Sucking pests include cotton stainers, the chili thrips, &quot;Scirtothrips dorsalis&quot;; the cotton seed bug, &quot;Oxycarenus hyalinipennis&quot;. Defoliators include the fall armyworm, &quot;Spodoptera frugiperda&quot;.

Cotton yield is threatened by the evolution of new biotypes of insects and of new pathogens. Maintaining good yield requires strategies to slow these adversaries&#x27; evolution.
====North American insect pests====
Historically, in North America, one of the most economically destructive pests in cotton production has been the boll weevil. Boll weevils are beetles who ate cotton in the 1950s, that slowed the production of the cotton industry drastically. &quot;This bone pile of short budgets, loss of market share, failing prices, abandoned farms, and the new immunity of boll weevils generated a feeling of helplessness&quot; Boll Weevils first appeared in Beeville, Texas wiping out field after field of cotton in south Texas. This swarm of Boll Weevils swept through east Texas and spread to the eastern seaboard, leaving ruin and devastation in its path, causing many cotton farmers to go out of business.
Due to the US Department of Agriculture&#x27;s highly successful Boll Weevil Eradication Program (BWEP), this pest has been eliminated from cotton in most of the United States. This program, along with the introduction of genetically engineered Bt cotton, has improved the management of a number of pests such as cotton bollworm and pink bollworm. Sucking pests include the cotton stainer, &quot;Dysdercus suturellus&quot; and the tarnish plant bug, &quot;Lygus lineolaris&quot;. A significant cotton disease is caused by &quot;Xanthomonas citri&quot; subsp. &quot;malvacearum&quot;.

==Harvesting==

Most cotton in the United States, Europe and Australia is harvested mechanically, either by a cotton picker, a machine that removes the cotton from the boll without damaging the cotton plant, or by a cotton stripper, which strips the entire boll off the plant. Cotton strippers are used in regions where it is too windy to grow picker varieties of cotton, and usually after application of a chemical defoliant or the natural defoliation that occurs after a freeze. Cotton is a perennial crop in the tropics, and without defoliation or freezing, the plant will continue to grow.

Cotton continues to be picked by hand in developing countries and in Xinjiang, China, allegedly by forced labor. Xinjiang produces over 20% of the world&#x27;s cotton.

==Competition from synthetic fibers==
The era of manufactured fibers began with the development of rayon in France in the 1890s. Rayon is derived from a natural cellulose and cannot be considered synthetic, but requires extensive processing in a manufacturing process, and led the less expensive replacement of more naturally derived materials. A succession of new synthetic fibers were introduced by the chemicals industry in the following decades. Acetate in fiber form was developed in 1924. Nylon, the first fiber synthesized entirely from petrochemicals, was introduced as a sewing thread by DuPont in 1936, followed by DuPont&#x27;s acrylic in 1944. Some garments were created from fabrics based on these fibers, such as women&#x27;s hosiery from nylon, but it was not until the introduction of polyester into the fiber marketplace in the early 1950s that the market for cotton came under threat. The rapid uptake of polyester garments in the 1960s caused economic hardship in cotton-exporting economies, especially in Central American countries, such as Nicaragua, where cotton production had boomed tenfold between 1950 and 1965 with the advent of cheap chemical pesticides. Cotton production recovered in the 1970s, but crashed to pre-1960 levels in the early 1990s.

== Competition from natural fibers ==
High water and pesticide use in cotton cultivation has prompted sustainability concerns and created a market for natural fiber alternatives. Other cellulose fibers, such as hemp, are seen as more sustainable options because of higher yields per acre with less water and pesticide use than cotton. Cellulose fiber alternatives have similar characteristics but are not perfect substitutes for cotton textiles with differences in properties like tensile strength and thermal regulation.

==Uses==
Cotton is used to make a number of textile products. These include terrycloth for highly absorbent bath towels and robes; denim for blue jeans; cambric, popularly used in the manufacture of blue work shirts (from which the term &quot;blue-collar&quot; is derived) and corduroy, seersucker, and cotton twill. Socks, underwear, and most T-shirts are made from cotton. Bed sheets often are made from cotton. It is a preferred material for sheets as it is hypoallergenic, easy to maintain and non-irritant to the skin. Cotton also is used to make yarn used in crochet and knitting. Fabric also can be made from recycled or recovered cotton that otherwise would be thrown away during the spinning, weaving, or cutting process. While many fabrics are made completely of cotton, some materials blend cotton with other fibers, including rayon and synthetic fibers such as polyester. It can either be used in knitted or woven fabrics, as it can be blended with elastine to make a stretchier thread for knitted fabrics, and apparel such as stretch jeans. Cotton can be blended also with linen producing fabrics with the benefits of both materials. Linen-cotton blends are wrinkle resistant and retain heat more effectively than only linen, and are thinner, stronger and lighter than only cotton.

In addition to the textile industry, cotton is used in fishing nets, coffee filters, tents, explosives manufacture (see nitrocellulose), cotton paper, and in bookbinding. Fire hoses were once made of cotton.

The cottonseed which remains after the cotton is ginned is used to produce cottonseed oil, which, after refining, can be consumed by humans like any other vegetable oil. The cottonseed meal that is left generally is fed to ruminant livestock; the gossypol remaining in the meal is toxic to monogastric animals. Cottonseed hulls can be added to dairy cattle rations for roughage. During the American slavery period, cotton root bark was used in folk remedies as an abortifacient, that is, to induce a miscarriage. Gossypol was one of the many substances found in all parts of the cotton plant and it was described by the scientists as &#x27;poisonous pigment&#x27;. It also appears to inhibit the development of sperm or even restrict the mobility of the sperm. Also, it is thought to interfere with the menstrual cycle by restricting the release of certain hormones.

Cotton linters are fine, silky fibers which adhere to the seeds of the cotton plant after ginning. These curly fibers typically are less than long. The term also may apply to the longer textile fiber staple lint as well as the shorter fuzzy fibers from some upland species. Linters are traditionally used in the manufacture of paper and as a raw material in the manufacture of cellulose. In the UK, linters are referred to as &quot;cotton wool&quot;.
A less technical use of the term &quot;cotton wool&quot;, in the UK and Ireland, is for the refined product known as &quot;absorbent cotton&quot; (or, often, just &quot;cotton&quot;) in U.S. usage: fluffy cotton in sheets or balls used for medical, cosmetic, protective packaging, and many other practical purposes. The first medical use of cotton wool was by Sampson Gamgee at the Queen&#x27;s Hospital (later the General Hospital) in Birmingham, England.

Long staple (LS cotton) is cotton of a longer fibre length and therefore of higher quality, while Extra-long staple cotton (ELS cotton) has longer fibre length still and of even higher quality. The name &quot;Egyptian cotton&quot; is broadly associated high quality cottons and is often an LS or (less often) an ELS cotton. Nowadays the name &quot;Egyptian cotton&quot; refers more to the way cotton is treated and threads produced rather than the location where it is grown. The American cotton variety &quot;Pima&quot; cotton is often compared to Egyptian cotton, as both are used in high quality bed sheets and other cotton products. While Pima cotton is often grown in the American southwest, the Pima name is now used by cotton-producing nations such as Peru, Australia and Israel. Not all products bearing the Pima name are made with the finest cotton: American-grown ELS Pima cotton is trademarked as &quot;Supima&quot; cotton. &quot;Kasturi&quot; cotton is a brand-building initiative for Indian long staple cotton by the Indian government. The PIB issued a press release announcing the same.

Cottons have been grown as ornamentals or novelties due to their showy flowers and snowball-like fruit. For example, Jumel&#x27;s cotton, once an important source of fiber in Egypt, started as an ornamental. However, agricultural authorities such as the Boll Weevil Eradication Program in the United States discourage using cotton as an ornamental, due to concerns about these plants harboring pests injurious to crops.

==International trade==
The largest producers of cotton, as of 2017, are India and China, with annual production of about and , respectively; most of this production is consumed by their respective textile industries. The largest exporters of raw cotton are the United States, with sales of $4.9 billion, and Africa, with sales of $2.1 billion. The total international trade is estimated to be $12 billion. Africa&#x27;s share of the cotton trade has doubled since 1980. Neither area has a significant domestic textile industry, textile manufacturing having moved to developing nations in Eastern and South Asia such as India and China. In Africa, cotton is grown by numerous small holders. Dunavant Enterprises, based in Memphis, Tennessee, is the leading cotton broker in Africa, with hundreds of purchasing agents. It operates cotton gins in Uganda, Mozambique, and Zambia. In Zambia, it often offers loans for seed and expenses to the 180,000 small farmers who grow cotton for it, as well as advice on farming methods. Cargill also purchases cotton in Africa for export.

The 25,000 cotton growers in the United States are heavily subsidized at the rate of $2 billion per year although China now provides the highest overall level of cotton sector support. The future of these subsidies is uncertain and has led to anticipatory expansion of cotton brokers&#x27; operations in Africa. Dunavant expanded in Africa by buying out local operations. This is only possible in former British colonies and Mozambique; former French colonies continue to maintain tight monopolies, inherited from their former colonialist masters, on cotton purchases at low fixed prices.

To encourage trade and organize discussion about cotton, World Cotton Day is celebrated every October 7.

Cotton is included within World Trade Organization (WTO) activities within two &quot;complementary tracks&quot;:
*trade aspects, around multilateral negotiations aiming to address distorting subsidies and trade barriers affecting cotton; and 
*development assistance provided within the cotton production industry and its value chain.
An agreement on trade in cotton formed part of the ministerial declaration concluding the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 2005.

==Production==
In 2022, world production of cotton was 69.7 million tonnes, led by China with 26% of the total. Other major producers were India (22%) and the United States (12%) (table).

The five leading exporters of cotton in 2019 are (1) India, (2) the United States, (3) China, (4) Brazil, and (5) Pakistan.

In India, the states of Maharashtra (26.63%), Gujarat (17.96%) and Andhra Pradesh (13.75%) and also Madhya Pradesh are the leading cotton producing states, these states have a predominantly tropical wet and dry climate.

In the United States, the state of Texas led in total production as of 2004, while the state of California had the highest yield per acre.

===Fair trade===
Cotton is an enormously important commodity throughout the world. It provides livelihoods for up to 1 billion people, including 100 million smallholder farmers who cultivate cotton. However, many farmers in developing countries receive a low price for their produce, or find it difficult to compete with developed countries.

This has led to an international dispute (see Brazil–United States cotton dispute):

On 27 September 2002, Brazil requested consultations with the US regarding prohibited and actionable subsidies provided to US producers, users and/or exporters of upland cotton, as well as legislation, regulations, statutory instruments and amendments thereto providing such subsidies (including export credits), grants, and any other assistance to the US producers, users and exporters of upland cotton.

On 8 September 2004, the Panel Report recommended that the United States &quot;withdraw&quot; export credit guarantees and payments to domestic users and exporters, and &quot;take appropriate steps to remove the adverse effects or withdraw&quot; the mandatory price-contingent subsidy measures.
While Brazil was fighting the US through the WTO&#x27;s Dispute Settlement Mechanism against a heavily subsidized cotton industry, a group of four least-developed African countries – Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, and Mali – also known as &quot;Cotton-4&quot; have been the leading protagonist for the reduction of US cotton subsidies through negotiations. The four introduced a &quot;Sectoral Initiative in Favour of Cotton&quot;, presented by Burkina Faso&#x27;s President Blaise Compaoré during the Trade Negotiations Committee on 10 June 2003.

In addition to concerns over subsidies, the cotton industries of some countries are criticized for employing child labor and damaging workers&#x27; health by exposure to pesticides used in production. The Environmental Justice Foundation has campaigned against the prevalent use of forced child and adult labor in cotton production in Uzbekistan, the world&#x27;s third largest cotton exporter.

The international production and trade situation has led to &quot;fair trade&quot; cotton clothing and footwear, joining a rapidly growing market for organic clothing, fair fashion or &quot;ethical fashion&quot;. The fair trade system was initiated in 2005 with producers from Cameroon, Mali and Senegal, with the Association Max Havelaar France playing a lead role in the establishment of this segment of the fair trade system in conjunction with Fairtrade International and the French organisation Dagris (&quot;Développement des Agro-Industries du Sud&quot;).

===Trading===


Cotton is bought and sold by investors and price speculators as a tradable commodity on two different commodity exchanges in the United States of America.

*Cotton No. 2 futures contracts are traded on the ICE Futures US Softs (NYI) under the ticker symbol CT. They are delivered every year in March, May, July, October, and December.
*Cotton futures contracts are traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) under the ticker symbol TT. They are delivered every year in March, May, July, October, and December.
===Critical temperatures===
*Favorable travel temperature range: below 
*Optimum travel temperature: 
*Glow temperature: 
*Fire point: 
*Autoignition temperature: 
*Autoignition temperature (for oily cotton): 

A temperature range of is the optimal range for mold development. At temperatures below , rotting of wet cotton stops. Damaged cotton is sometimes stored at these temperatures to prevent further deterioration.

Egypt has a unique climatic temperature that the soil and the temperature provide an exceptional environment for cotton to grow rapidly.

==British standard yarn measures==
*1 thread = 
*1 skein or rap = 80 threads ()
*1 hank = 7 skeins ()
*1 spindle = 18 hanks ()

==Fiber properties==

Depending upon the origin, the chemical composition of cotton is as follows:
*Cellulose 91.00%
*Water 7.85%
*Protoplasm, pectins 0.55%
*Waxes, fatty substances 0.40%
*Mineral salts 0.20%

=== Morphology ===
Cotton has a more complex structure among the other crops. A matured cotton fiber is a single, elongated complete dried multilayer cell that develops in the surface layer of cottonseed. It has the following parts.

# The cuticle is the outer most layer. It is a waxy layer that contains pectins and proteinaceous materials.
# The primary wall is the original thin cell wall. Primary wall is mainly cellulose, it is made up of a network of fine fibrils (small strands of cellulose).
# The winding layer is the first layer of secondary thickening it is also called the S1 layer. It is different in structure from both the primary wall and the remainder of the secondary wall. It consists of fibrils aligned at 40 to 70-degree angles to the fiber axis in an open netting type of pattern.
# The secondary wall consists of concentric layers of cellulose it is also called the S2 layer, that constitute the main portion of the cotton fiber. After the fiber has attained its maximum diameter, new layers of cellulose are added to form the secondary wall. The fibrils are deposited at 70 to 80-degree angles to the fiber axis, reversing angle at points along the length of the fiber.
# The lumen is the hollow canal that runs the length of the fiber. It is filled with living protoplasm during the growth period. After the fiber matures and the boll opens, the protoplast dries up, and the lumen naturally collapses, leaving a central void, or pore space, in each fiber. It separates the secondary wall from the lumen and appears to be more resistant to certain reagents than the secondary wall layers. The lumen wall also called the S3 layer.

==== Dead cotton ====
Dead cotton is a term that refers to unripe cotton fibers that do not absorb dye. Dead cotton is immature cotton that has poor dye affinity and appears as white specks on a dyed fabric. When cotton fibers are analyzed and assessed through a microscope, dead fibers appear differently. Dead cotton fibers have thin cell walls. In contrast, mature fibers have more cellulose and a greater degree of cell wall thickening

==Genome==
There is a public effort to sequence the genome of cotton. It was started in 2007 by a consortium of public researchers. Their aim is to sequence the genome of cultivated, tetraploid cotton. &quot;Tetraploid&quot; means that its nucleus has two separate genomes, called A and D. The consortium agreed to first sequence the D-genome wild relative of cultivated cotton (&quot;G. raimondii&quot;, a Central American species) because it is small and has few repetitive elements. It has nearly one-third of the bases of tetraploid cotton, and each chromosome occurs only once. Then, the A genome of &quot;G. arboreum&quot; would be sequenced. Its genome is roughly twice that of &quot;G. raimondii&quot;. Part of the difference in size is due to the amplification of &quot;retrotransposons&quot; (GORGE). After both diploid genomes are assembled, they would be used as models for sequencing the genomes of tetraploid cultivated species. Without knowing the diploid genomes, the euchromatic DNA sequences of AD genomes would co-assemble, and their repetitive elements would assemble independently into A and D sequences respectively. There would be no way to untangle the mess of AD sequences without comparing them to their diploid counterparts.

The public sector effort continues with the goal to create a high-quality, draft genome sequence from reads generated by all sources. The effort has generated Sanger reads of BACs, fosmids, and plasmids, as well as 454 reads. These later types of reads will be instrumental in assembling an initial draft of the D genome. In 2010, the companies Monsanto and Illumina completed enough Illumina sequencing to cover the D genome of &quot;G. raimondii&quot; about 50x. They announced that they would donate their raw reads to the public. This public relations effort gave them some recognition for sequencing the cotton genome. Once the D genome is assembled from all of this raw material, it will undoubtedly assist in the assembly of the AD genomes of cultivated varieties of cotton, but much work remains.

As of 2014, at least one assembled cotton genome had been reported.

<text>The heart is a muscular organ found in humans and other animals. This organ pumps blood through the blood vessels. Heart and blood vessels together make the circulatory system. The pumped blood carries oxygen and nutrients to the tissue, while carrying metabolic waste such as carbon dioxide to the lungs. In humans, the heart is approximately the size of a closed fist and is located between the lungs, in the middle compartment of the chest, called the mediastinum.
In humans, the heart is divided into four chambers: upper left and right atria and lower left and right ventricles. Commonly, the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart. In a healthy heart, blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves, which prevent backflow. The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains a small amount of fluid. The wall of the heart is made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium. 
The heart pumps blood with a rhythm determined by a group of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node. These generate an electric current that causes the heart to contract, traveling through the atrioventricular node and along the conduction system of the heart. In humans, deoxygenated blood enters the heart through the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle. From here, it is pumped into pulmonary circulation to the lungs, where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium, passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta into systemic circulation, traveling through arteries, arterioles, and capillaries—where nutrients and other substances are exchanged between blood vessels and cells, losing oxygen and gaining carbon dioxide—before being returned to the heart through venules and veins. The adult heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute. Exercise temporarily increases the rate, but lowers it in the long term, and is good for heart health.
Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death globally as of 2008, accounting for 30% of all human deaths. Of these more than three-quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke. Risk factors include: smoking, being overweight, little exercise, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and poorly controlled diabetes, among others. Cardiovascular diseases do not frequently have symptoms but may cause chest pain or shortness of breath. Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a medical history, listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope, as well as with ECG, and echocardiogram which uses ultrasound. Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists, although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment.

==Structure==

===Location and shape===

The human heart is situated in the mediastinum, at the level of thoracic vertebrae T5–T8. A double-membraned sac called the pericardium surrounds the heart and attaches to the mediastinum. The back surface of the heart lies near the vertebral column, and the front surface, known as the sternocostal surface, sits behind the sternum and rib cartilages. The upper part of the heart is the attachment point for several large blood vessels—the venae cavae, aorta and pulmonary trunk. The upper part of the heart is located at the level of the third costal cartilage. The lower tip of the heart, the apex, lies to the left of the sternum (8 to 9 cm from the midsternal line) between the junction of the fourth and fifth ribs near their articulation with the costal cartilages.

The largest part of the heart is usually slightly offset to the left side of the chest (levocardia). In a rare congenital disorder (dextrocardia) the heart is offset to the right side and is felt to be on the left because the left heart is stronger and larger, since it pumps to all body parts. Because the heart is between the lungs, the left lung is smaller than the right lung and has a cardiac notch in its border to accommodate the heart.
The heart is cone-shaped, with its base positioned upwards and tapering down to the apex. An adult heart has a mass of 250–350 grams (9–12 oz). The heart is often described as the size of a fist: 12 cm (5 in) in length, 8 cm (3.5 in) wide, and 6 cm (2.5 in) in thickness, although this description is disputed, as the heart is likely to be slightly larger. Well-trained athletes can have much larger hearts due to the effects of exercise on the heart muscle, similar to the response of skeletal muscle.

===Chambers===

The heart has four chambers, two upper atria, the receiving chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The atria open into the ventricles via the atrioventricular valves, present in the atrioventricular septum. This distinction is visible also on the surface of the heart as the coronary sulcus. There is an ear-shaped structure in the upper right atrium called the right atrial appendage, or auricle, and another in the upper left atrium, the left atrial appendage. The right atrium and the right ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the right heart. Similarly, the left atrium and the left ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the left heart. The ventricles are separated from each other by the interventricular septum, visible on the surface of the heart as the anterior longitudinal sulcus and the posterior interventricular sulcus.

The fibrous cardiac skeleton gives structure to the heart. It forms the atrioventricular septum, which separates the atria from the ventricles, and the fibrous rings, which serve as bases for the four heart valves. The cardiac skeleton also provides an important boundary in the heart&#x27;s electrical conduction system since collagen cannot conduct electricity. The interatrial septum separates the atria, and the interventricular septum separates the ventricles. The interventricular septum is much thicker than the interatrial septum since the ventricles need to generate greater pressure when they contract.

====Valves====


The heart has four valves, which separate its chambers. One valve lies between each atrium and ventricle, and one valve rests at the exit of each ventricle.

The valves between the atria and ventricles are called the atrioventricular valves. Between the right atrium and the right ventricle is the tricuspid valve. The tricuspid valve has three cusps, which connect to chordae tendinae and three papillary muscles named the anterior, posterior, and septal muscles, after their relative positions. The mitral valve lies between the left atrium and left ventricle. It is also known as the bicuspid valve due to its having two cusps, an anterior and a posterior cusp. These cusps are also attached via chordae tendinae to two papillary muscles projecting from the ventricular wall.

The papillary muscles extend from the walls of the heart to valves by cartilaginous connections called chordae tendinae. These muscles prevent the valves from falling too far back when they close. During the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle, the papillary muscles are also relaxed and the tension on the chordae tendineae is slight. As the heart chambers contract, so do the papillary muscles. This creates tension on the chordae tendineae, helping to hold the cusps of the atrioventricular valves in place and preventing them from being blown back into the atria.

Two additional semilunar valves sit at the exit of each of the ventricles. The pulmonary valve is located at the base of the pulmonary artery. This has three cusps which are not attached to any papillary muscles. When the ventricle relaxes blood flows back into the ventricle from the artery and this flow of blood fills the pocket-like valve, pressing against the cusps which close to seal the valve. The semilunar aortic valve is at the base of the aorta and also is not attached to papillary muscles. This too has three cusps which close with the pressure of the blood flowing back from the aorta.

====Right heart====

The right heart consists of two chambers, the right atrium and the right ventricle, separated by a valve, the tricuspid valve.

The right atrium receives blood almost continuously from the body&#x27;s two major veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae. A small amount of blood from the coronary circulation also drains into the right atrium via the coronary sinus, which is immediately above and to the middle of the opening of the inferior vena cava. In the wall of the right atrium is an oval-shaped depression known as the fossa ovalis, which is a remnant of an opening in the fetal heart known as the foramen ovale. Most of the internal surface of the right atrium is smooth, the depression of the fossa ovalis is medial, and the anterior surface has prominent ridges of pectinate muscles, which are also present in the right atrial appendage.

The right atrium is connected to the right ventricle by the tricuspid valve. The walls of the right ventricle are lined with trabeculae carneae, ridges of cardiac muscle covered by endocardium. In addition to these muscular ridges, a band of cardiac muscle, also covered by endocardium, known as the moderator band reinforces the thin walls of the right ventricle and plays a crucial role in cardiac conduction. It arises from the lower part of the interventricular septum and crosses the interior space of the right ventricle to connect with the inferior papillary muscle. The right ventricle tapers into the pulmonary trunk, into which it ejects blood when contracting. The pulmonary trunk branches into the left and right pulmonary arteries that carry the blood to each lung. The pulmonary valve lies between the right heart and the pulmonary trunk.

====Left heart====

The left heart has two chambers: the left atrium and the left ventricle, separated by the mitral valve.

The left atrium receives oxygenated blood back from the lungs via one of the four pulmonary veins. The left atrium has an outpouching called the left atrial appendage. Like the right atrium, the left atrium is lined by pectinate muscles. The left atrium is connected to the left ventricle by the mitral valve.

The left ventricle is much thicker as compared with the right, due to the greater force needed to pump blood to the entire body. Like the right ventricle, the left also has trabeculae carneae, but there is no moderator band. The left ventricle pumps blood to the body through the aortic valve and into the aorta. Two small openings above the aortic valve carry blood to the heart muscle; the left coronary artery is above the left cusp of the valve, and the right coronary artery is above the right cusp.

===Wall===

The heart wall is made up of three layers: the inner endocardium, middle myocardium and outer epicardium. These are surrounded by a double-membraned sac called the pericardium.

The innermost layer of the heart is called the endocardium. It is made up of a lining of simple squamous epithelium and covers heart chambers and valves. It is continuous with the endothelium of the veins and arteries of the heart, and is joined to the myocardium with a thin layer of connective tissue. The endocardium, by secreting endothelins, may also play a role in regulating the contraction of the myocardium.

The middle layer of the heart wall is the myocardium, which is the cardiac muscle—a layer of involuntary striated muscle tissue surrounded by a framework of collagen. The cardiac muscle pattern is elegant and complex, as the muscle cells swirl and spiral around the chambers of the heart, with the outer muscles forming a figure 8 pattern around the atria and around the bases of the great vessels and the inner muscles, forming a figure 8 around the two ventricles and proceeding toward the apex. This complex swirling pattern allows the heart to pump blood more effectively.

There are two types of cells in cardiac muscle: muscle cells which have the ability to contract easily, and pacemaker cells of the conducting system. The muscle cells make up the bulk (99%) of cells in the atria and ventricles. These contractile cells are connected by intercalated discs which allow a rapid response to impulses of action potential from the pacemaker cells. The intercalated discs allow the cells to act as a syncytium and enable the contractions that pump blood through the heart and into the major arteries. The pacemaker cells make up 1% of cells and form the conduction system of the heart. They are generally much smaller than the contractile cells and have few myofibrils which gives them limited contractibility. Their function is similar in many respects to neurons. Cardiac muscle tissue has autorhythmicity, the unique ability to initiate a cardiac action potential at a fixed rate—spreading the impulse rapidly from cell to cell to trigger the contraction of the entire heart.

There are specific proteins expressed in cardiac muscle cells. These are mostly associated with muscle contraction, and bind with actin, myosin, tropomyosin, and troponin. They include MYH6, ACTC1, TNNI3, CDH2 and PKP2. Other proteins expressed are MYH7 and LDB3 that are also expressed in skeletal muscle.

=== Pericardium ===

The pericardium is the sac that surrounds the heart. The tough outer surface of the pericardium is called the fibrous membrane. This is lined by a double inner membrane called the serous membrane that produces pericardial fluid to lubricate the surface of the heart. The part of the serous membrane attached to the fibrous membrane is called the parietal pericardium, while the part of the serous membrane attached to the heart is known as the visceral pericardium. The pericardium is present in order to lubricate its movement against other structures within the chest, to keep the heart&#x27;s position stabilised within the chest, and to protect the heart from infection.

===Coronary circulation===
Heart tissue, like all cells in the body, needs to be supplied with oxygen, nutrients and a way of removing metabolic wastes. This is achieved by the coronary circulation, which includes arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels. Blood flow through the coronary vessels occurs in peaks and troughs relating to the heart muscle&#x27;s relaxation or contraction.

Heart tissue receives blood from two arteries which arise just above the aortic valve. These are the left main coronary artery and the right coronary artery. The left main coronary artery splits shortly after leaving the aorta into two vessels, the left anterior descending and the left circumflex artery. The left anterior descending artery supplies heart tissue and the front, outer side, and septum of the left ventricle. It does this by branching into smaller arteries—diagonal and septal branches. The left circumflex supplies the back and underneath of the left ventricle. The right coronary artery supplies the right atrium, right ventricle, and lower posterior sections of the left ventricle. The right coronary artery also supplies blood to the atrioventricular node (in about 90% of people) and the sinoatrial node (in about 60% of people). The right coronary artery runs in a groove at the back of the heart and the left anterior descending artery runs in a groove at the front. There is significant variation between people in the anatomy of the arteries that supply the heart. The arteries divide at their furthest reaches into smaller branches that join at the edges of each arterial distribution.

The coronary sinus is a large vein that drains into the right atrium, and receives most of the venous drainage of the heart. It receives blood from the great cardiac vein (receiving the left atrium and both ventricles), the posterior cardiac vein (draining the back of the left ventricle), the middle cardiac vein (draining the bottom of the left and right ventricles), and small cardiac veins. The anterior cardiac veins drain the front of the right ventricle and drain directly into the right atrium.

Small lymphatic networks called plexuses exist beneath each of the three layers of the heart. These networks collect into a main left and a main right trunk, which travel up the groove between the ventricles that exists on the heart&#x27;s surface, receiving smaller vessels as they travel up. These vessels then travel into the atrioventricular groove, and receive a third vessel which drains the section of the left ventricle sitting on the diaphragm. The left vessel joins with this third vessel, and travels along the pulmonary artery and left atrium, ending in the inferior tracheobronchial node. The right vessel travels along the right atrium and the part of the right ventricle sitting on the diaphragm. It usually then travels in front of the ascending aorta and then ends in a brachiocephalic node.

===Nerve supply===

The heart receives nerve signals from the vagus nerve and from nerves arising from the sympathetic trunk. These nerves act to influence, but not control, the heart rate. Sympathetic nerves also influence the force of heart contraction. Signals that travel along these nerves arise from two paired cardiovascular centres in the medulla oblongata. The vagus nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system acts to decrease the heart rate, and nerves from the sympathetic trunk act to increase the heart rate. These nerves form a network of nerves that lies over the heart called the cardiac plexus.

The vagus nerve is a long, wandering nerve that emerges from the brainstem and provides parasympathetic stimulation to a large number of organs in the thorax and abdomen, including the heart. The nerves from the sympathetic trunk emerge through the T1–T4 thoracic ganglia and travel to both the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, as well as to the atria and ventricles. The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers. Sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline) at the neuromuscular junction of the cardiac nerves. This shortens the repolarisation period, thus speeding the rate of depolarisation and contraction, which results in an increased heart rate. It opens chemical or ligand-gated sodium and calcium ion channels, allowing an influx of positively charged ions. Norepinephrine binds to the beta–1 receptor.

==Development==


The heart is the first functional organ to develop and starts to beat and pump blood at about three weeks into embryogenesis. This early start is crucial for subsequent embryonic and prenatal development.

The heart derives from splanchnopleuric mesenchyme in the neural plate which forms the cardiogenic region. Two endocardial tubes form here that fuse to form a primitive heart tube known as the tubular heart. Between the third and fourth week, the heart tube lengthens, and begins to fold to form an S-shape within the pericardium. This places the chambers and major vessels into the correct alignment for the developed heart. Further development will include the formation of the septa and the valves and the remodeling of the heart chambers. By the end of the fifth week, the septa are complete, and by the ninth week, the heart valves are complete.

Before the fifth week, there is an opening in the fetal heart known as the foramen ovale. The foramen ovale allowed blood in the fetal heart to pass directly from the right atrium to the left atrium, allowing some blood to bypass the lungs. Within seconds after birth, a flap of tissue known as the septum primum that previously acted as a valve closes the foramen ovale and establishes the typical cardiac circulation pattern. A depression in the surface of the right atrium remains where the foramen ovale was, called the fossa ovalis.

The embryonic heart begins beating at around 22 days after conception (5 weeks after the last normal menstrual period, LMP). It starts to beat at a rate near to the mother&#x27;s which is about 75–80 beats per minute (bpm). The embryonic heart rate then accelerates and reaches a peak rate of 165–185 bpm early in the early 7th week (early 9th week after the LMP). After 9 weeks (start of the fetal stage) it starts to decelerate, slowing to around 145 (±25) bpm at birth. There is no difference in female and male heart rates before birth.

==Physiology==
===Blood flow===

The heart functions as a pump in the circulatory system to provide a continuous flow of blood throughout the body. This circulation consists of the systemic circulation to and from the body and the pulmonary circulation to and from the lungs. Blood in the pulmonary circulation exchanges carbon dioxide for oxygen in the lungs through the process of respiration. The systemic circulation then transports oxygen to the body and returns carbon dioxide and relatively deoxygenated blood to the heart for transfer to the lungs.

The right heart collects deoxygenated blood from two large veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae. Blood collects in the right and left atrium continuously. The superior vena cava drains blood from above the diaphragm and empties into the upper back part of the right atrium. The inferior vena cava drains the blood from below the diaphragm and empties into the back part of the atrium below the opening for the superior vena cava. Immediately above and to the middle of the opening of the inferior vena cava is the opening of the thin-walled coronary sinus. Additionally, the coronary sinus returns deoxygenated blood from the myocardium to the right atrium. The blood collects in the right atrium. When the right atrium contracts, the blood is pumped through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. As the right ventricle contracts, the tricuspid valve closes and the blood is pumped into the pulmonary trunk through the pulmonary valve. The pulmonary trunk divides into pulmonary arteries and progressively smaller arteries throughout the lungs, until it reaches capillaries. As these pass by alveoli carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen. This happens through the passive process of diffusion.

In the left heart, oxygenated blood is returned to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It is then pumped into the left ventricle through the mitral valve and into the aorta through the aortic valve for systemic circulation. The aorta is a large artery that branches into many smaller arteries, arterioles, and ultimately capillaries. In the capillaries, oxygen and nutrients from blood are supplied to body cells for metabolism, and exchanged for carbon dioxide and waste products. Capillary blood, now deoxygenated, travels into venules and veins that ultimately collect in the superior and inferior vena cavae, and into the right heart.

====Cardiac cycle====

The cardiac cycle is the sequence of events in which the heart contracts and relaxes with every heartbeat. The period of time during which the ventricles contract, forcing blood out into the aorta and main pulmonary artery, is known as systole, while the period during which the ventricles relax and refill with blood is known as diastole. The atria and ventricles work in concert, so in systole when the ventricles are contracting, the atria are relaxed and collecting blood. When the ventricles are relaxed in diastole, the atria contract to pump blood to the ventricles. This coordination ensures blood is pumped efficiently to the body.

At the beginning of the cardiac cycle, the ventricles are relaxing. As they do so, they are filled by blood passing through the open mitral and tricuspid valves. After the ventricles have completed most of their filling, the atria contract, forcing further blood into the ventricles and priming the pump. Next, the ventricles start to contract. As the pressure rises within the cavities of the ventricles, the mitral and tricuspid valves are forced shut. As the pressure within the ventricles rises further, exceeding the pressure with the aorta and pulmonary arteries, the aortic and pulmonary valves open. Blood is ejected from the heart, causing the pressure within the ventricles to fall. Simultaneously, the atria refill as blood flows into the right atrium through the superior and inferior vena cavae, and into the left atrium through the pulmonary veins. Finally, when the pressure within the ventricles falls below the pressure within the aorta and pulmonary arteries, the aortic and pulmonary valves close. The ventricles start to relax, the mitral and tricuspid valves open, and the cycle begins again.

====Cardiac output====
Cardiac output (CO) is a measurement of the amount of blood pumped by each ventricle (stroke volume) in one minute. This is calculated by multiplying the stroke volume (SV) by the beats per minute of the heart rate (HR). So that: CO = SV x HR.
The cardiac output is normalized to body size through body surface area and is called the cardiac index.

The average cardiac output, using an average stroke volume of about 70mL, is 5.25 L/min, with a normal range of 4.0–8.0 L/min. The stroke volume is normally measured using an echocardiogram and can be influenced by the size of the heart, physical and mental condition of the individual, sex, contractility, duration of contraction, preload and afterload.

Preload refers to the filling pressure of the atria at the end of diastole, when the ventricles are at their fullest. A main factor is how long it takes the ventricles to fill: if the ventricles contract more frequently, then there is less time to fill and the preload will be less. Preload can also be affected by a person&#x27;s blood volume. The force of each contraction of the heart muscle is proportional to the preload, described as the Frank-Starling mechanism. This states that the force of contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of muscle fiber, meaning a ventricle will contract more forcefully, the more it is stretched.

Afterload, or how much pressure the heart must generate to eject blood at systole, is influenced by vascular resistance. It can be influenced by narrowing of the heart valves (stenosis) or contraction or relaxation of the peripheral blood vessels.

The strength of heart muscle contractions controls the stroke volume. This can be influenced positively or negatively by agents termed inotropes. These agents can be a result of changes within the body, or be given as drugs as part of treatment for a medical disorder, or as a form of life support, particularly in intensive care units. Inotropes that increase the force of contraction are &quot;positive&quot; inotropes, and include sympathetic agents such as adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine. &quot;Negative&quot; inotropes decrease the force of contraction and include calcium channel blockers.

===Electrical conduction===

The normal rhythmical heart beat, called sinus rhythm, is established by the heart&#x27;s own pacemaker, the sinoatrial node (also known as the sinus node or the SA node). Here an electrical signal is created that travels through the heart, causing the heart muscle to contract. The sinoatrial node is found in the upper part of the right atrium near to the junction with the superior vena cava. The electrical signal generated by the sinoatrial node travels through the right atrium in a radial way that is not completely understood. It travels to the left atrium via Bachmann&#x27;s bundle, such that the muscles of the left and right atria contract together. The signal then travels to the atrioventricular node. This is found at the bottom of the right atrium in the atrioventricular septum, the boundary between the right atrium and the left ventricle. The septum is part of the cardiac skeleton, tissue within the heart that the electrical signal cannot pass through, which forces the signal to pass through the atrioventricular node only. The signal then travels along the bundle of His to left and right bundle branches through to the ventricles of the heart. In the ventricles the signal is carried by specialized tissue called the Purkinje fibers which then transmit the electric charge to the heart muscle.

===Heart rate===
The normal resting heart rate is called the sinus rhythm, created and sustained by the sinoatrial node, a group of pacemaking cells found in the wall of the right atrium. Cells in the sinoatrial node do this by creating an action potential. The cardiac action potential is created by the movement of specific electrolytes into and out of the pacemaker cells. The action potential then spreads to nearby cells.

When the sinoatrial cells are resting, they have a negative charge on their membranes. A rapid influx of sodium ions causes the membrane&#x27;s charge to become positive; this is called depolarisation and occurs spontaneously. Once the cell has a sufficiently high charge, the sodium channels close and calcium ions then begin to enter the cell, shortly after which potassium begins to leave it. All the ions travel through ion channels in the membrane of the sinoatrial cells. The potassium and calcium start to move out of and into the cell only once it has a sufficiently high charge, and so are called voltage-gated. Shortly after this, the calcium channels close and potassium channels open, allowing potassium to leave the cell. This causes the cell to have a negative resting charge and is called repolarisation. When the membrane potential reaches approximately −60 mV, the potassium channels close and the process may begin again.

The ions move from areas where they are concentrated to where they are not. For this reason sodium moves into the cell from outside, and potassium moves from within the cell to outside the cell. Calcium also plays a critical role. Their influx through slow channels means that the sinoatrial cells have a prolonged &quot;plateau&quot; phase when they have a positive charge. A part of this is called the absolute refractory period. Calcium ions also combine with the regulatory protein troponin C in the troponin complex to enable contraction of the cardiac muscle, and separate from the protein to allow relaxation.

The adult resting heart rate ranges from 60 to 100 bpm. The resting heart rate of a newborn can be 129 beats per minute (bpm) and this gradually decreases until maturity. An athlete&#x27;s heart rate can be lower than 60 bpm. During exercise the rate can be 150 bpm with maximum rates reaching from 200 to 220 bpm.

====Influences====
The normal sinus rhythm of the heart, giving the resting heart rate, is influenced by a number of factors. The cardiovascular centres in the brainstem control the sympathetic and parasympathetic influences to the heart through the vagus nerve and sympathetic trunk. These cardiovascular centres receive input from a series of receptors including baroreceptors, sensing the stretching of blood vessels and chemoreceptors, sensing the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood and its pH. Through a series of reflexes these help regulate and sustain blood flow.

Baroreceptors are stretch receptors located in the aortic sinus, carotid bodies, the venae cavae, and other locations, including pulmonary vessels and the right side of the heart itself. Baroreceptors fire at a rate determined by how much they are stretched, which is influenced by blood pressure, level of physical activity, and the relative distribution of blood. With increased pressure and stretch, the rate of baroreceptor firing increases, and the cardiac centers decrease sympathetic stimulation and increase parasympathetic stimulation. As pressure and stretch decrease, the rate of baroreceptor firing decreases, and the cardiac centers increase sympathetic stimulation and decrease parasympathetic stimulation. There is a similar reflex, called the atrial reflex or Bainbridge reflex, associated with varying rates of blood flow to the atria. Increased venous return stretches the walls of the atria where specialized baroreceptors are located. However, as the atrial baroreceptors increase their rate of firing and as they stretch due to the increased blood pressure, the cardiac center responds by increasing sympathetic stimulation and inhibiting parasympathetic stimulation to increase heart rate. The opposite is also true. Chemoreceptors present in the carotid body or adjacent to the aorta in an aortic body respond to the blood&#x27;s oxygen, carbon dioxide levels. Low oxygen or high carbon dioxide will stimulate firing of the receptors.

Exercise and fitness levels, age, body temperature, basal metabolic rate, and even a person&#x27;s emotional state can all affect the heart rate. High levels of the hormones epinephrine, norepinephrine, and thyroid hormones can increase the heart rate. The levels of electrolytes including calcium, potassium, and sodium can also influence the speed and regularity of the heart rate; low blood oxygen, low blood pressure and dehydration may increase it.

==Clinical significance==
===Diseases===
Cardiovascular diseases, which include diseases of the heart, are the leading cause of death worldwide. The majority of cardiovascular disease is noncommunicable and related to lifestyle and other factors, becoming more prevalent with ageing. Heart disease is a major cause of death, accounting for an average of 30% of all deaths in 2008, globally. This rate varies from a lower 28% to a high 40% in high-income countries. Doctors that specialise in the heart are called cardiologists. Many other medical professionals are involved in treating diseases of the heart, including doctors, cardiothoracic surgeons, intensivists, and allied health practitioners including physiotherapists and dieticians.

==== Ischemic heart disease ====
Coronary artery disease, also known as ischemic heart disease, is caused by atherosclerosis—a build-up of fatty material along the inner walls of the arteries. These fatty deposits known as atherosclerotic plaques narrow the coronary arteries, and if severe may reduce blood flow to the heart. If a narrowing (or stenosis) is relatively minor then the patient may not experience any symptoms. Severe narrowings may cause chest pain (angina) or breathlessness during exercise or even at rest. The thin covering of an atherosclerotic plaque can rupture, exposing the fatty centre to the circulating blood. In this case a clot or thrombus can form, blocking the artery, and restricting blood flow to an area of heart muscle causing a myocardial infarction (a heart attack) or unstable angina. In the worst case this may cause cardiac arrest, a sudden and utter loss of output from the heart. Obesity, high blood pressure, uncontrolled diabetes, smoking and high cholesterol can all increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.

Heart failure is defined as a condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the demands of the body. Patients with heart failure may experience breathlessness especially when lying flat, as well as ankle swelling, known as peripheral oedema. Heart failure is the result of many diseases affecting the heart, but is most commonly associated with ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, or high blood pressure. Less common causes include various cardiomyopathies. Heart failure is frequently associated with weakness of the heart muscle in the ventricles (systolic heart failure), but can also be seen in patients with heart muscle that is strong but stiff (diastolic heart failure). The condition may affect the left ventricle (causing predominantly breathlessness), the right ventricle (causing predominantly swelling of the legs and an elevated jugular venous pressure), or both ventricles. Patients with heart failure are at higher risk of developing dangerous heart rhythm disturbances or arrhythmias.

==== Cardiomyopathies ====
Cardiomyopathies are diseases affecting the muscle of the heart. Some cause abnormal thickening of the heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), some cause the heart to abnormally expand and weaken (dilated cardiomyopathy), some cause the heart muscle to become stiff and unable to fully relax between contractions (restrictive cardiomyopathy) and some make the heart prone to abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy). These conditions are often genetic and can be inherited, but some such as dilated cardiomyopathy may be caused by damage from toxins such as alcohol. Some cardiomyopathies such as hypertrophic cardiomopathy are linked to a higher risk of sudden cardiac death, particularly in athletes. Many cardiomyopathies can lead to heart failure in the later stages of the disease.

==== Valvular heart disease ====
Healthy heart valves allow blood to flow easily in one direction, and prevent it from flowing in the other direction. A diseased heart valve may have a narrow opening (stenosis), that restricts the flow of blood in the forward direction. A valve may otherwise be leaky, allowing blood to leak in the reverse direction (regurgitation). Valvular heart disease may cause breathlessness, blackouts, or chest pain, but may be asymptomatic and only detected on a routine examination by hearing abnormal heart sounds or a heart murmur. In the developed world, valvular heart disease is most commonly caused by degeneration secondary to old age, but may also be caused by infection of the heart valves (endocarditis). In some parts of the world rheumatic heart disease is a major cause of valvular heart disease, typically leading to mitral or aortic stenosis and caused by the body&#x27;s immune system reacting to a streptococcal throat infection.

==== Cardiac arrhythmias ====
While in the healthy heart, waves of electrical impulses originate in the sinus node before spreading to the rest of the atria, the atrioventricular node, and finally the ventricles (referred to as a normal sinus rhythm), this normal rhythm can be disrupted. Abnormal heart rhythms or arrhythmias may be asymptomatic or may cause palpitations, blackouts, or breathlessness. Some types of arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation increase the long term risk of stroke.

Some arrhythmias cause the heart to beat abnormally slowly, referred to as a bradycardia or bradyarrhythmia. This may be caused by an abnormally slow sinus node or damage within the cardiac conduction system (heart block). In other arrhythmias the heart may beat abnormally rapidly, referred to as a tachycardia or tachyarrhythmia. These arrhythmias can take many forms and can originate from different structures within the heart—some arise from the atria (e.g. atrial flutter), some from the atrioventricular node (e.g. AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia) whilst others arise from the ventricles (e.g. ventricular tachycardia). Some tachyarrhythmias are caused by scarring within the heart (e.g. some forms of ventricular tachycardia), others by an irritable focus (e.g. focal atrial tachycardia), while others are caused by additional abnormal conduction tissue that has been present since birth (e.g. Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome). The most dangerous form of heart racing is ventricular fibrillation, in which the ventricles quiver rather than contract, and which if untreated is rapidly fatal.

==== Pericardial disease ====
The sac which surrounds the heart, called the pericardium, can become inflamed in a condition known as pericarditis. This condition typically causes chest pain that may spread to the back, and is often caused by a viral infection (glandular fever, cytomegalovirus, or coxsackievirus). Fluid can build up within the pericardial sac, referred to as a pericardial effusion. Pericardial effusions often occur secondary to pericarditis, kidney failure, or tumours, and frequently do not cause any symptoms. However, large effusions or effusions which accumulate rapidly can compress the heart in a condition known as cardiac tamponade, causing breathlessness and potentially fatal low blood pressure. Fluid can be removed from the pericardial space for diagnosis or to relieve tamponade using a syringe in a procedure called pericardiocentesis.

==== Congenital heart disease ====

Some people are born with hearts that are abnormal and these abnormalities are known as congenital heart defects. They may range from the relatively minor (e.g. patent foramen ovale, arguably a variant of normal) to serious life-threatening abnormalities (e.g. hypoplastic left heart syndrome). Common abnormalities include those that affect the heart muscle that separates the two side of the heart (a &quot;hole in the heart&quot;, e.g. ventricular septal defect). Other defects include those affecting the heart valves (e.g. congenital aortic stenosis), or the main blood vessels that lead from the heart (e.g. coarctation of the aorta). More complex syndromes are seen that affect more than one part of the heart (e.g. Tetralogy of Fallot).

Some congenital heart defects allow blood that is low in oxygen that would normally be returned to the lungs to instead be pumped back to the rest of the body. These are known as cyanotic congenital heart defects and are often more serious. Major congenital heart defects are often picked up in childhood, shortly after birth, or even before a child is born (e.g. transposition of the great arteries), causing breathlessness and a lower rate of growth. More minor forms of congenital heart disease may remain undetected for many years and only reveal themselves in adult life (e.g., atrial septal defect).

==== Channelopathies ====

Channelopathies can be categorized based on the organ system they affect. In the cardiovascular system, the electrical impulse required for each heart beat is provided by the electrochemical gradient of each heart cell. Because the beating of the heart depends on the proper movement of ions across the surface membrane, cardiac ion channelopathies form a major group of heart diseases. Cardiac ion channelopathies may explain some of the cases of sudden death syndrome and sudden arrhythmic death syndrome. Long QT syndrome is the most common form of cardiac channelopathy.

* Long QT syndrome (LQTS) – Mostly hereditary. On EKG can be observed as longer corrected QT interval (QTc). Characterized by fainting, sudden, life-threatening heart rhythm disturbances – Torsades de pointes type ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation and risk of sudden cardiac death.
* Short QT syndrome.
* Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT).
* Progressive cardiac conduction defect (PCCD).
* Early repolarisation syndrome (BER) – common in younger and active people, especially men, because it is affected by higher testosterone levels, which cause increased potassium currents, which further causes an elevation of the J-point on the EKG. In very rare cases, it can lead to ventricular fibrillation and death.
* Brugada syndrome – a genetic disorder characterized by an abnormal EKG and is one of the most common causes of sudden cardiac death in young men.

===Diagnosis===
Heart disease is diagnosed by the taking of a medical history, a cardiac examination, and further investigations, including blood tests, echocardiograms, electrocardiograms, and imaging. Other invasive procedures such as cardiac catheterisation can also play a role.

====Examination====
The cardiac examination includes inspection, feeling the chest with the hands (palpation) and listening with a stethoscope (auscultation). It involves assessment of signs that may be visible on a person&#x27;s hands (such as splinter haemorrhages), joints and other areas. A person&#x27;s pulse is taken, usually at the radial artery near the wrist, in order to assess for the rhythm and strength of the pulse. The blood pressure is taken, using either a manual or automatic sphygmomanometer or using a more invasive measurement from within the artery. Any elevation of the jugular venous pulse is noted. A person&#x27;s chest is felt for any transmitted vibrations from the heart, and then listened to with a stethoscope.

====Heart sounds====
Typically, healthy hearts have only two audible heart sounds, called S1 and S2. The first heart sound S1, is the sound created by the closing of the atrioventricular valves during ventricular contraction and is normally described as &quot;lub&quot;. The second heart sound, S2, is the sound of the semilunar valves closing during ventricular diastole and is described as &quot;dub&quot;. Each sound consists of two components, reflecting the slight difference in time as the two valves close. S2 may split into two distinct sounds, either as a result of inspiration or different valvular or cardiac problems. Additional heart sounds may also be present and these give rise to gallop rhythms. A third heart sound, S3 usually indicates an increase in ventricular blood volume. A fourth heart sound S4 is referred to as an atrial gallop and is produced by the sound of blood being forced into a stiff ventricle. The combined presence of S3 and S4 give a quadruple gallop.
Heart murmurs are abnormal heart sounds which can be either related to disease or benign, and there are several kinds. There are normally two heart sounds, and abnormal heart sounds can either be extra sounds, or &quot;murmurs&quot; related to the flow of blood between the sounds. Murmurs are graded by volume, from 1 (the quietest), to 6 (the loudest), and evaluated by their relationship to the heart sounds, position in the cardiac cycle, and additional features such as their radiation to other sites, changes with a person&#x27;s position, the frequency of the sound as determined by the side of the stethoscope by which they are heard, and site at which they are heard loudest. Murmurs may be caused by damaged heart valves or congenital heart disease such as ventricular septal defects, or may be heard in normal hearts. A different type of sound, a pericardial friction rub can be heard in cases of pericarditis where the inflamed membranes can rub together.

====Blood tests====
Blood tests play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of many cardiovascular conditions.

Troponin is a sensitive biomarker for a heart with insufficient blood supply. It is released 4–6 hours after injury and usually peaks at about 12–24 hours. Two tests of troponin are often taken—one at the time of initial presentation and another within 3–6 hours, with either a high level or a significant rise being diagnostic. A test for brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) can be used to evaluate for the presence of heart failure, and rises when there is increased demand on the left ventricle. These tests are considered biomarkers because they are highly specific for cardiac disease. Testing for the MB form of creatine kinase provides information about the heart&#x27;s blood supply, but is used less frequently because it is less specific and sensitive.

Other blood tests are often taken to help understand a person&#x27;s general health and risk factors that may contribute to heart disease. These often include a full blood count investigating for anaemia, and basic metabolic panel that may reveal any disturbances in electrolytes. A coagulation screen is often required to ensure that the right level of anticoagulation is given. Fasting lipids and fasting blood glucose (or an HbA1c level) are often ordered to evaluate a person&#x27;s cholesterol and diabetes status, respectively.

====Electrocardiogram====
Using surface electrodes on the body, it is possible to record the electrical activity of the heart. This tracing of the electrical signal is the electrocardiogram (ECG) or (EKG). An ECG is a bedside test and involves the placement of ten leads on the body. This produces a &quot;12 lead&quot; ECG (three extra leads are calculated mathematically, and one lead is electrically ground, or earthed).

There are five prominent features on the ECG: the P wave (atrial depolarisation), the QRS complex (ventricular depolarisation) and the T wave (ventricular repolarisation). As the heart cells contract, they create a current that travels through the heart. A downward deflection on the ECG implies cells are becoming more positive in charge (&quot;depolarising&quot;) in the direction of that lead, whereas an upward inflection implies cells are becoming more negative (&quot;repolarising&quot;) in the direction of the lead. This depends on the position of the lead, so if a wave of depolarising moved from left to right, a lead on the left would show a negative deflection, and a lead on the right would show a positive deflection. The ECG is a useful tool in detecting rhythm disturbances and in detecting insufficient blood supply to the heart. Sometimes abnormalities are suspected, but not immediately visible on the ECG. Testing when exercising can be used to provoke an abnormality or an ECG can be worn for a longer period such as a 24-hour Holter monitor if a suspected rhythm abnormality is not present at the time of assessment.

====Imaging====

Several imaging methods can be used to assess the anatomy and function of the heart, including ultrasound (echocardiography), angiography, CT, MRI, and PET, scans. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart used to measure the heart&#x27;s function, assess for valve disease, and look for any abnormalities. Echocardiography can be conducted by a probe on the chest (transthoracic), or by a probe in the esophagus (transesophageal). A typical echocardiography report will include information about the width of the valves noting any stenosis, whether there is any backflow of blood (regurgitation) and information about the blood volumes at the end of systole and diastole, including an ejection fraction, which describes how much blood is ejected from the left and right ventricles after systole. Ejection fraction can then be obtained by dividing the volume ejected by the heart (stroke volume) by the volume of the filled heart (end-diastolic volume). Echocardiograms can also be conducted under circumstances when the body is more stressed, in order to examine for signs of lack of blood supply. This cardiac stress test involves either direct exercise, or where this is not possible, injection of a drug such as dobutamine.

CT scans, chest X-rays and other forms of imaging can help evaluate the heart&#x27;s size, evaluate for signs of pulmonary oedema, and indicate whether there is fluid around the heart. They are also useful for evaluating the aorta, the major blood vessel which leaves the heart.

===Treatment===
Diseases affecting the heart can be treated by a variety of methods including lifestyle modification, drug treatment, and surgery.

====Ischemic heart disease====
Narrowings of the coronary arteries (ischemic heart disease) are treated to relieve symptoms of chest pain caused by a partially narrowed artery (angina pectoris), to minimise heart muscle damage when an artery is completely occluded (myocardial infarction), or to prevent a myocardial infarction from occurring. Medications to improve angina symptoms include nitroglycerin, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers, while preventative treatments include antiplatelets such as aspirin and statins, lifestyle measures such as stopping smoking and weight loss, and treatment of risk factors such as high blood pressure and diabetes.

In addition to using medications, narrowed heart arteries can be treated by expanding the narrowings or redirecting the flow of blood to bypass an obstruction. This may be performed using a percutaneous coronary intervention, during which narrowings can be expanded by passing small balloon-tipped wires into the coronary arteries, inflating the balloon to expand the narrowing, and sometimes leaving behind a metal scaffold known as a stent to keep the artery open.

If the narrowings in coronary arteries are unsuitable for treatment with a percutaneous coronary intervention, open surgery may be required. A coronary artery bypass graft can be performed, whereby a blood vessel from another part of the body (the saphenous vein, radial artery, or internal mammary artery) is used to redirect blood from a point before the narrowing (typically the aorta) to a point beyond the obstruction.

==== Valvular heart disease ====
Diseased heart valves that have become abnormally narrow or abnormally leaky may require surgery. This is traditionally performed as an open surgical procedure to replace the damaged heart valve with a tissue or metallic prosthetic valve. In some circumstances, the tricuspid or mitral valves can be repaired surgically, avoiding the need for a valve replacement. Heart valves can also be treated percutaneously, using techniques that share many similarities with percutaneous coronary intervention. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is increasingly used for patients consider very high risk for open valve replacement.

==== Cardiac arrhythmias ====
Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) can be treated using antiarrhythmic drugs. These may work by manipulating the flow of electrolytes across the cell membrane (such as calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers, amiodarone, or digoxin), or modify the autonomic nervous system&#x27;s effect on the heart (beta blockers and atropine). In some arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation which increase the risk of stroke, this risk can be reduced using anticoagulants such as warfarin or novel oral anticoagulants.

If medications fail to control an arrhythmia, another treatment option may be catheter ablation. In these procedures, wires are passed from a vein or artery in the leg to the heart to find the abnormal area of tissue that is causing the arrhythmia. The abnormal tissue can be intentionally damaged, or ablated, by heating or freezing to prevent further heart rhythm disturbances. Whilst the majority of arrhythmias can be treated using minimally invasive catheter techniques, some arrhythmias (particularly atrial fibrillation) can also be treated using open or thoracoscopic surgery, either at the time of other cardiac surgery or as a standalone procedure. A cardioversion, whereby an electric shock is used to stun the heart out of an abnormal rhythm, may also be used.

Cardiac devices in the form of pacemakers or implantable defibrillators may also be required to treat arrhythmias. Pacemakers, comprising a small battery powered generator implanted under the skin and one or more leads that extend to the heart, are most commonly used to treat abnormally slow heart rhythms. Implantable defibrillators are used to treat serious life-threatening rapid heart rhythms. These devices monitor the heart, and if dangerous heart racing is detected can automatically deliver a shock to restore the heart to a normal rhythm. Implantable defibrillators are most commonly used in patients with heart failure, cardiomyopathies, or inherited arrhythmia syndromes.

==== Heart failure ====
As well as addressing the underlying cause for a patient&#x27;s heart failure (most commonly ischemic heart disease or hypertension), the mainstay of heart failure treatment is with medication. These include drugs to prevent fluid from accumulating in the lungs by increasing the amount of urine a patient produces (diuretics), and drugs that attempt to preserve the pumping function of the heart (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists).

In some patients with heart failure, a specialised pacemaker known as cardiac resynchronisation therapy can be used to improve the heart&#x27;s pumping efficiency. These devices are frequently combined with a defibrillator. In very severe cases of heart failure, a small pump called a ventricular assist device may be implanted which supplements the heart&#x27;s own pumping ability. In the most severe cases, a cardiac transplant may be considered.

== History ==
=== Ancient ===

Humans have known about the heart since ancient times, although its precise function and anatomy were not clearly understood. From the primarily religious views of earlier societies towards the heart, ancient Greeks are considered to have been the primary seat of scientific understanding of the heart in the ancient world. Aristotle considered the heart to be the organ responsible for creating blood; Plato considered the heart as the source of circulating blood and Hippocrates noted blood circulating cyclically from the body through the heart to the lungs. Erasistratos (304–250 BCE) noted the heart as a pump, causing dilation of blood vessels, and noted that arteries and veins both radiate from the heart, becoming progressively smaller with distance, although he believed they were filled with air and not blood. He also discovered the heart valves.

The Greek physician Galen (2nd century CE) knew blood vessels carried blood and identified venous (dark red) and arterial (brighter and thinner) blood, each with distinct and separate functions. Galen, noting the heart as the hottest organ in the body, concluded that it provided heat to the body. The heart did not pump blood around, the heart&#x27;s motion sucked blood in during diastole and the blood moved by the pulsation of the arteries themselves. Galen believed the arterial blood was created by venous blood passing from the left ventricle to the right through &#x27;pores&#x27; between the ventricles. Air from the lungs passed from the lungs via the pulmonary artery to the left side of the heart and created arterial blood.

These ideas went unchallenged for almost a thousand years.

=== Pre-modern ===
The earliest descriptions of the coronary and pulmonary circulation systems can be found in the &quot;Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna&#x27;s Canon&quot;, published in 1242 by Ibn al-Nafis. In his manuscript, al-Nafis wrote that blood passes through the pulmonary circulation instead of moving from the right to the left ventricle as previously believed by Galen. His work was later translated into Latin by Andrea Alpago.

In Europe, the teachings of Galen continued to dominate the academic community and his doctrines were adopted as the official canon of the Church. Andreas Vesalius questioned some of Galen&#x27;s beliefs of the heart in &quot;De humani corporis fabrica&quot; (1543), but his magnum opus was interpreted as a challenge to the authorities and he was subjected to a number of attacks. Michael Servetus wrote in &quot;Christianismi Restitutio&quot; (1553) that blood flows from one side of the heart to the other via the lungs.

=== Modern ===
A breakthrough in understanding the flow of blood through the heart and body came with the publication of &quot;De Motu Cordis&quot; (1628) by the English physician William Harvey. Harvey&#x27;s book completely describes the systemic circulation and the mechanical force of the heart, leading to an overhaul of the Galenic doctrines. Otto Frank (1865–1944) was a German physiologist; among his many published works are detailed studies of this important heart relationship. Ernest Starling (1866–1927) was an important English physiologist who also studied the heart. Although they worked largely independently, their combined efforts and similar conclusions have been recognized in the name &quot;Frank–Starling mechanism&quot;.

Although Purkinje fibers and the bundle of His were discovered as early as the 19th century, their specific role in the electrical conduction system of the heart remained unknown until Sunao Tawara published his monograph, titled &quot;Das Reizleitungssystem des Säugetierherzens&quot;, in 1906. Tawara&#x27;s discovery of the atrioventricular node prompted Arthur Keith and Martin Flack to look for similar structures in the heart, leading to their discovery of the sinoatrial node several months later. These structures form the anatomical basis of the electrocardiogram, whose inventor, Willem Einthoven, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in 1924.

The first heart transplant in a human ever performed was by James Hardy in 1964, using a chimpanzee heart, but the patient died within 2 hours. The first human to human heart transplantation was performed in 1967 by the South African surgeon Christiaan Barnard at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town. This marked an important milestone in cardiac surgery, capturing the attention of both the medical profession and the world at large. However, long-term survival rates of patients were initially very low. Louis Washkansky, the first recipient of a donated heart, died 18 days after the operation while other patients did not survive for more than a few weeks. The American surgeon Norman Shumway has been credited for his efforts to improve transplantation techniques, along with pioneers Richard Lower, Vladimir Demikhov and Adrian Kantrowitz. As of March 2000, more than 55,000 heart transplantations have been performed worldwide. The first successful transplant of a heart from a genetically modified pig to a human in which the patient lived for a longer time, was performed January 7, 2022 in Baltimore by heart surgeon Bartley P. Griffith, recipient was David Bennett (57) this successfully extended his life until 8 March 2022 (1 month and 30 days).

By the middle of the 20th century, heart disease had surpassed infectious disease as the leading cause of death in the United States, and it is currently the leading cause of deaths worldwide. Since 1948, the ongoing Framingham Heart Study has shed light on the effects of various influences on the heart, including diet, exercise, and common medications such as aspirin. Although the introduction of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers has improved the management of chronic heart failure, the disease continues to be an enormous medical and societal burden, with 30 to 40% of patients dying within a year of receiving the diagnosis.

==Society and culture==

===Symbolism===
As one of the vital organs, the heart was long identified as the center of the entire body, the seat of life, or emotion, or reason, will, intellect, purpose or the mind. The heart is an emblematic symbol in many religions, signifying &quot;truth, conscience or moral courage in many religions—the temple or throne of God in Islamic and Judeo-Christian thought; the divine centre, or atman, and the third eye of transcendent wisdom in Hinduism; the diamond of purity and essence of the Buddha; the Taoist centre of understanding.&quot;

In the Hebrew Bible, the word for heart, &quot;lev&quot;, is used in these meanings, as the seat of emotion, the mind, and referring to the anatomical organ. It is also connected in function and symbolism to the stomach.

An important part of the concept of the soul in Ancient Egyptian religion was thought to be the heart, or &quot;ib&quot;. The &quot;ib&quot; or metaphysical heart was believed to be formed from one drop of blood from the child&#x27;s mother&#x27;s heart, taken at conception. To ancient Egyptians, the heart was the seat of emotion, thought, will, and intention. This is evidenced by Egyptian expressions which incorporate the word &quot;ib&quot;, such as &quot;Awi-ib&quot; for &quot;happy&quot; (literally, &quot;long of heart&quot;), &quot;Xak-ib&quot; for &quot;estranged&quot; (literally, &quot;truncated of heart&quot;). In Egyptian religion, the heart was the key to the afterlife. It was conceived as surviving death in the nether world, where it gave evidence for, or against, its possessor. The heart was therefore not removed from the body during mummification, and was believed to be the center of intelligence and feeling, and needed in the afterlife. It was thought that the heart was examined by Anubis and a variety of deities during the &quot;Weighing of the Heart&quot; ceremony. If the heart weighed more than the feather of Maat, which symbolized the ideal standard of behavior. If the scales balanced, it meant the heart&#x27;s possessor had lived a just life and could enter the afterlife; if the heart was heavier, it would be devoured by the monster Ammit.

The Chinese character for &quot;heart&quot;, 心, derives from a comparatively realistic depiction of a heart (indicating the heart chambers) in seal script. The Chinese word &quot;xīn&quot; also takes the metaphorical meanings of &quot;mind&quot;, &quot;intention&quot;, or &quot;core&quot;, and is often translated as &quot;heart-mind&quot; as the ancient Chinese believed the heart was the center of human cognition. In Chinese medicine, the heart is seen as the center of 神 &quot;shén&quot; &quot;spirit, consciousness&quot;. The heart is associated with the small intestine, tongue, governs the six organs and five viscera, and belongs to fire in the five elements.

The Sanskrit word for heart is &quot;hṛd&quot; or &quot;hṛdaya&quot;, found in the oldest surviving Sanskrit text, the Rigveda. In Sanskrit, it may mean both the anatomical object and &quot;mind&quot; or &quot;soul&quot;, representing the seat of emotion. &quot;Hrd&quot; may be a cognate of the word for heart in Greek, Latin, and English.

Many classical philosophers and scientists, including Aristotle, considered the heart the seat of thought, reason, or emotion, often disregarding the brain as contributing to those functions. The identification of the heart as the seat of emotions in particular is due to the Roman physician Galen, who also located the seat of the passions in the liver, and the seat of reason in the brain.

The heart also played a role in the Aztec system of belief. The most common form of human sacrifice practiced by the Aztecs was heart-extraction. The Aztec believed that the heart (&quot;tona&quot;) was both the seat of the individual and a fragment of the Sun&#x27;s heat (&quot;istli&quot;). To this day, the Nahua consider the Sun to be a heart-soul (&quot;tona-tiuh&quot;): &quot;round, hot, pulsating&quot;.

Indigenous leaders from Alaska to Australia came together in 2020 to deliver a message to the world that humanity needs to shift from the mind to the heart, and let our heart be in charge of what we do. The message was made into a film, which highlighted that humanity must open their hearts to restore balance to the world. Kumu Sabra Kauka, a Hawaiian studies educator and tradition bearer summed up the message of the film saying &quot;Listen to your heart. Follow your path. May it be clear, and for the good of all.&quot; The film was led by Illarion Merculieff from the Aleut (Unangan) tribe. Merculieff has written that Unangan Elders referred to the heart as a &quot;source of wisdom&quot;, &quot;a deeper portal of profound interconnectedness and awareness that exists between humans and all living things&quot;.

In Catholicism, there has been a long tradition of veneration of the heart, stemming from worship of the wounds of Jesus Christ which gained prominence from the mid sixteenth century. This tradition influenced the development of the medieval Christian devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the parallel veneration of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, made popular by John Eudes. There are also many references to the heart in the Christian Bible, including &quot;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God&quot;, &quot;Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it&quot;, &quot;For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also&quot;, &quot;For as a man thinks in his heart, so shall he be.&quot;

The expression of a broken heart is a cross-cultural reference to grief for a lost one or to unfulfilled romantic love.

The notion of &quot;Cupid&#x27;s arrows&quot; is ancient, due to Ovid, but while Ovid describes Cupid as wounding his victims with his arrows, it is not made explicit that it is the &quot;heart&quot; that is wounded. The familiar iconography of Cupid shooting little heart symbols is a Renaissance theme that became tied to Valentine&#x27;s Day.

In certain Trans-New Guinea languages, such as Foi and Momoona, the heart and seat of emotions are colexified, meaning they share the same word.

===Food===

Animal hearts are widely consumed as a type of offal. As they are almost entirely muscle, they are high in protein. They are often included in dishes with other internal organs, for example in the pan-Ottoman kokoretsi.

Chicken hearts are considered to be giblets, and are often grilled on skewers; examples of this are Japanese &quot;hāto yakitori&quot;, Brazilian &quot;churrasco de coração&quot;, and Indonesian chicken heart satay. They can also be pan-fried, as in Jerusalem mixed grill. In Egyptian cuisine, they can be used, finely chopped, as part of stuffing for chicken. Many recipes combined them with other giblets, such as the Mexican &quot;pollo en menudencias&quot; and the Russian &quot;ragu iz kurinyikh potrokhov&quot;.

The hearts of beef, pork, and mutton can generally be interchanged in recipes. As heart is a hard-working muscle, it makes for &quot;firm and rather dry&quot; meat, so is generally slow-cooked. Another way of dealing with toughness is to julienne the meat, as in Chinese stir-fried heart.

Beef heart is valued for its high meat quality and low price, being commonly disregarded in conventional meat pricing. It can be cut into steaks, comparable in quality to the more expensive cuts of meat from the same animal, though it is distinguished by a lack of a discernible grain. It was historically eaten in the United States as a cost-saving measure, but is today also eaten as an independently desirable ingredient. Beef heart may be grilled or braised. In the Peruvian &quot;anticuchos de corazón&quot;, barbecued beef hearts are grilled after being tenderized through long marination in a spice and vinegar mixture. An Australian recipe for &quot;mock goose&quot; is actually braised stuffed beef heart.

Pork heart can be stewed, poached, braised, or made into sausage. The Balinese &quot;oret&quot; is a sort of blood sausage made with pig heart and blood. A French recipe for &quot;cœur de porc à l&#x27;orange&quot; is made of braised heart with an orange sauce.

==Other animals==
===Vertebrates===
The size of the heart varies among the different animal groups, with hearts in vertebrates ranging from those of the smallest mice (12 mg) to the blue whale (600 kg). In vertebrates, the heart lies in the middle of the ventral part of the body, surrounded by a pericardium. which in some fish may be connected to the peritoneum. In all vertebrates, the heart has an asymmetric orientation, almost always on the left side. According to one theory, this is caused by a developmental axial twist in the early embryo.

The sinoatrial node is found in all amniotes but not in more primitive vertebrates. In these animals, the muscles of the heart are relatively continuous, and the sinus venosus coordinates the beat, which passes in a wave through the remaining chambers. Since the sinus venosus is incorporated into the right atrium in amniotes, it is likely homologous with the SA node. In teleosts, with their vestigial sinus venosus, the main centre of coordination is, instead, in the atrium. The rate of heartbeat varies enormously between different species, ranging from around 20 beats per minute in codfish to around 600 in hummingbirds and up to 1,200 bpm in the ruby-throated hummingbird.

===Double circulatory systems===
Adult amphibians and most reptiles have a double circulatory system, meaning a circulatory system divided into arterial and venous parts. However, the heart itself is not completely separated into two sides. Instead, it is separated into three chambers—two atria and one ventricle. Blood returning from both the systemic circulation and the lungs is returned, and blood is pumped simultaneously into the systemic circulation and the lungs. The double system allows blood to circulate to and from the lungs which deliver oxygenated blood directly to the heart.

In reptiles, other than snakes, the heart is usually situated around the middle of the thorax. In terrestrial and arboreal snakes, it is usually located nearer to the head; in aquatic species the heart is more centrally located. There is a heart with three chambers: two atria and one ventricle. The form and function of these hearts are different from mammalian hearts due to the fact that snakes have an elongated body, and thus are affected by different environmental factors. In particular, the snake&#x27;s heart relative to the position in their body has been influenced greatly by gravity. Therefore, snakes that are larger in size tend to have a higher blood pressure due to gravitational change. The ventricle is incompletely separated into two-halves by a wall (septum), with a considerable gap near the pulmonary artery and aortic openings. In most reptilian species, there appears to be little, if any, mixing between the bloodstreams, so the aorta receives, essentially, only oxygenated blood. The exception to this rule is crocodiles, which have a four-chambered heart.

In the heart of lungfish, the septum extends partway into the ventricle. This allows for some degree of separation between the de-oxygenated bloodstream destined for the lungs and the oxygenated stream that is delivered to the rest of the body. The absence of such a division in living amphibian species may be partly due to the amount of respiration that occurs through the skin; thus, the blood returned to the heart through the venae cavae is already partially oxygenated. As a result, there may be less need for a finer division between the two bloodstreams than in lungfish or other tetrapods. Nonetheless, in at least some species of amphibian, the spongy nature of the ventricle does seem to maintain more of a separation between the bloodstreams. Also, the original valves of the conus arteriosus have been replaced by a spiral valve that divides it into two parallel parts, thereby helping to keep the two bloodstreams separate.

=== Full division ===
Archosaurs (crocodilians and birds) and mammals show complete separation of the heart into two pumps for a total of four heart chambers; it is thought that the four-chambered heart of archosaurs evolved independently from that of mammals. In crocodilians, there is a small opening, the foramen of Panizza, at the base of the arterial trunks and there is some degree of mixing between the blood in each side of the heart, during a dive underwater; thus, only in birds and mammals are the two streams of blood—those to the pulmonary and systemic circulations—permanently kept entirely separate by a physical barrier.

===Fish===
The heart evolved no less than 380 million years ago in fish. Fish have what is often described as a two-chambered heart, consisting of one atrium to receive blood and one ventricle to pump it. However, the fish heart has entry and exit compartments that may be called chambers, so it is also sometimes described as three-chambered or four-chambered, depending on what is counted as a chamber. The atrium and ventricle are sometimes considered &quot;true chambers&quot;, while the others are considered &quot;accessory chambers&quot;.

Primitive fish have a four-chambered heart, but the chambers are arranged sequentially so that this primitive heart is quite unlike the four-chambered hearts of mammals and birds. The first chamber is the sinus venosus, which collects deoxygenated blood from the body through the hepatic and cardinal veins. From here, blood flows into the atrium and then to the powerful muscular ventricle where the main pumping action will take place. The fourth and final chamber is the conus arteriosus, which contains several valves and sends blood to the &quot;ventral aorta&quot;. The ventral aorta delivers blood to the gills where it is oxygenated and flows, through the dorsal aorta, into the rest of the body. (In tetrapods, the ventral aorta has divided in two; one half forms the ascending aorta, while the other forms the pulmonary artery).

In the adult fish, the four chambers are not arranged in a straight row but instead form an S-shape, with the latter two chambers lying above the former two. This relatively simple pattern is found in cartilaginous fish and in the ray-finned fish. In teleosts, the conus arteriosus is very small and can more accurately be described as part of the aorta rather than of the heart proper. The conus arteriosus is not present in any amniotes, presumably having been absorbed into the ventricles over the course of evolution. Similarly, while the sinus venosus is present as a vestigial structure in some reptiles and birds, it is otherwise absorbed into the right atrium and is no longer distinguishable.

===Invertebrates===
Arthropods and most mollusks have an open circulatory system. In this system, deoxygenated blood collects around the heart in cavities (sinuses). This blood slowly permeates the heart through many small one-way channels. The heart then pumps the blood into the hemocoel, a cavity between the organs. The heart in arthropods is typically a muscular tube that runs the length of the body, under the back and from the base of the head. Instead of blood the circulatory fluid is haemolymph which carries the most commonly used respiratory pigment, copper-based haemocyanin as the oxygen transporter. Haemoglobin is only used by a few arthropods.

In some other invertebrates such as earthworms, the circulatory system is not used to transport oxygen and so is much reduced, having no veins or arteries and consisting of two connected tubes. Oxygen travels by diffusion and there are five small muscular vessels that connect these vessels that contract at the front of the animals that can be thought of as &quot;hearts&quot;.

Squids and other cephalopods have two &quot;gill hearts&quot; also known as branchial hearts, and one &quot;systemic heart&quot;. The branchial hearts have two atria and one ventricle each, and pump to the gills, whereas the systemic heart pumps to the body.
Only the chordates (including vertebrates) and the hemichordates have a central &quot;heart&quot;, which is a vesicle formed from the thickening of the aorta and contracts to pump blood. This suggests a presence of it in the last common ancestor of these groups (may have been lost in the echinoderms).

<text>The subset sum problem (SSP) is a decision problem in computer science. In its most general formulation, there is a multiset formula_1 of integers and a target-sum formula_2, and the question is to decide whether any subset of the integers sum to precisely formula_2&quot;.&quot; The problem is known to be NP-complete. Moreover, some restricted variants of it are NP-complete too, for example:

* The variant in which all inputs are positive.
* The variant in which inputs may be positive or negative, and formula_4. For example, given the set formula_5, the answer is &quot;yes&quot; because the subset formula_6 sums to zero. 
* The variant in which all inputs are positive, and the target sum is exactly half the sum of all inputs, i.e., formula_7 . This special case of SSP is known as the partition problem.

SSP can also be regarded as an optimization problem: find a subset whose sum is at most &quot;T&quot;, and subject to that, as close as possible to &quot;T&quot;. It is NP-hard, but there are several algorithms that can solve it reasonably quickly in practice.

SSP is a special case of the knapsack problem and of the multiple subset sum problem.

== Computational hardness ==

The run-time complexity of SSP depends on two parameters: 

* - the number of input integers. If &quot;n&quot; is a small fixed number, then an exhaustive search for the solution is practical.
* - the precision of the problem, stated as the number of binary place values that it takes to state the problem. If &quot;L&quot; is a small fixed number, then there are dynamic programming algorithms that can solve it exactly.

As both &quot;n&quot; and &quot;L&quot; grow large, SSP is NP-hard. The complexity of the best known algorithms is exponential in the smaller of the two parameters &quot;n&quot; and &quot;L&quot;. The problem is NP-hard even when all input integers are positive (and the target-sum &quot;T&quot; is a part of the input). This can be proved by a direct reduction from 3SAT. It can also be proved by reduction from 3-dimensional matching (3DM):

* We are given an instance of 3DM, where the vertex sets are W, X, Y. Each set has &quot;n&quot; vertices. There are &quot;m&quot; edges, where each edge contains exactly one vertex from each of W, X, Y. Denote &quot;L&quot; := ceiling(log2(&quot;m&quot;+1)), so that &quot;L&quot; is larger than the number of bits required to represent the number of edges.
* We construct an instance of SSP with &quot;m&quot; positive integers. The integers are described by their binary representation. Each input integer can be represented by 3&quot;nL&quot; bits, divided into 3&quot;n&quot; zones of &quot;L&quot; bits. Each zone corresponds to a vertex.
* For each edge (w,x,y) in the 3DM instance, there is an integer in the SSP instance, in which exactly three bits are &quot;1&quot;: the least-significant bits in the zones of the vertices w, x, and y. For example, if &quot;n&quot;=10 and L=3, and W=(0...,9), X=(10...,19), Y=(20...,29), then the edge (0, 10, 20) is represented by the number (20+230+260).
* The target sum &quot;T&quot; in the SSP instance is set to an integer with &quot;1&quot; in the least-significant bit of every zone, that is, (20+21+...+23n-1).
* If the 3DM instance has a perfect matching, then summing the corresponding integers in the SSP instance yields exactly T.
* Conversely, if the SSP instance has a subset with sum exactly T, then, since the zones are sufficiently large so that there are no &quot;carries&quot; from one zone to the next, the sum must correspond to a perfect matching in the 3DM instance.

The following variants are also known to be NP-hard:

* The input integers can be both positive and negative, and the target-sum &quot;T&quot; = 0. This can be proved by reduction from the variant with positive integers. Denote that variant by SubsetSumPositive and the current variant by SubsetSumZero. Given an instance (&quot;S&quot;, &quot;T&quot;) of SubsetSumPositive, construct an instance of SubsetSumZero by adding a single element with value −&quot;T&quot;. Given a solution to the SubsetSumPositive instance, adding the −&quot;T&quot; yields a solution to the SubsetSumZero instance. Conversely, given a solution to the SubsetSumZero instance, it must contain the −&quot;T&quot; (since all integers in S are positive), so to get a sum of zero, it must also contain a subset of S with a sum of +&quot;T&quot;, which is a solution of the SubsetSumPositive instance.
*The input integers are positive, and &quot;T&quot; = sum(&quot;S&quot;)/2. This can also be proved by reduction from the general variant; see partition problem.

The analogous counting problem #SSP, which asks to enumerate the number of subsets summing to the target, is #P-complete.

== Exponential time algorithms ==

There are several ways to solve SSP in time exponential in &quot;n&quot;.

=== Inclusion–exclusion ===
The most naïve algorithm would be to cycle through all subsets of &quot;n&quot; numbers and, for every one of them, check if the subset sums to the right number. The running time is of order formula_8, since there are formula_9 subsets and, to check each subset, we need to sum at most &quot;n&quot; elements.

The algorithm can be implemented by depth-first search of a binary tree: each level in the tree corresponds to an input number; the left branch corresponds to excluding the number from the set, and the right branch corresponds to including the number (hence the name Inclusion-Exclusion). The memory required is formula_10. The run-time can be improved by several heuristics:

* Process the input numbers in descending order.
* If the integers included in a given node exceed the sum of the best subset found so far, the node is pruned.
* If the integers included in a given node, plus all remaining integers, are less than the sum of the best subset found so far, the node is pruned.

=== Horowitz and Sahni ===
In 1974, Horowitz and Sahni published a faster exponential-time algorithm, which runs in time formula_11, but requires much more space - formula_12. The algorithm splits arbitrarily the &quot;n&quot; elements into two sets of formula_13 each. For each of these two sets, it stores a list of the sums of all formula_14 possible subsets of its elements. Each of these two lists is then sorted. Using even the fastest comparison sorting algorithm, Mergesort for this step would take time formula_15. However, given a sorted list of sums for formula_16 elements, the list can be expanded to two sorted lists with the introduction of a (formula_17)th element, and these two sorted lists can be merged in time formula_18. Thus, each list can be generated in sorted form in time formula_19. Given the two sorted lists, the algorithm can check if an element of the first array and an element of the second array sum up to &quot;T&quot; in time formula_19. To do that, the algorithm passes through the first array in decreasing order (starting at the largest element) and the second array in increasing order (starting at the smallest element). Whenever the sum of the current element in the first array and the current element in the second array is more than &quot;T&quot;, the algorithm moves to the next element in the first array. If it is less than &quot;T&quot;, the algorithm moves to the next element in the second array. If two elements that sum to &quot;T&quot; are found, it stops. (The sub-problem for two elements sum is known as two-sum.)

=== Schroeppel and Shamir ===
In 1981, Schroeppel and Shamir presented an algorithm based on Horowitz and Sanhi, that requires similar runtime - formula_21, much less space - formula_22. Rather than generating and storing all subsets of &quot;n&quot;/2 elements in advance, they partition the elements into 4 sets of &quot;n&quot;/4 elements each, and generate subsets of &quot;n&quot;/2 element pairs dynamically using a min heap, which yields the above time and space complexities since this can be done in formula_23 and space formula_24 given 4 lists of length k.

Due to space requirements, the HS algorithm is practical for up to about 50 integers, and the SS algorithm is practical for up to 100 integers.

=== Howgrave-Graham and Joux ===
In 2010, Howgrave-Graham and Joux presented a probabilistic algorithm that runs faster than all previous ones - in time formula_25 using space formula_26. It solves only the decision problem, cannot prove there is no solution for a given sum, and does not return the subset sum closest to &quot;T&quot;.

The techniques of Howgrave-Graham and Joux were subsequently extended bringing the time complexity to formula_27. A more recent generalization lowered the time complexity to formula_28.

== Pseudo-polynomial time dynamic programming solutions ==

SSP can be solved in pseudo-polynomial time using dynamic programming. Suppose we have the following sequence of elements in an instance:

:formula_29

We define a &quot;state&quot; as a pair (&quot;i&quot;, &quot;s&quot;) of integers. This state represents the fact that

:&quot;there is a nonempty subset of formula_30 which sums to .&quot;

Each state (&quot;i&quot;, &quot;s&quot;) has two next states:

* (&quot;i&quot;+1, &quot;s&quot;), implying that formula_31 is not included in the subset;
* (&quot;i&quot;+1, &quot;s&quot;+formula_31), implying that formula_31 is included in the subset.

Starting from the initial state (0, 0), it is possible to use any graph search algorithm (e.g. BFS) to search the state (&quot;N&quot;, &quot;T&quot;). If the state is found, then by backtracking we can find a subset with a sum of exactly &quot;T&quot;.

The run-time of this algorithm is at most linear in the number of states. The number of states is at most &quot;N&quot; times the number of different possible sums. Let be the sum of the negative values and the sum of the positive values; the number of different possible sums is at most &quot;B&quot;-&quot;A&quot;, so the total runtime is in formula_34. For example, if all input values are positive and bounded by some constant &quot;C&quot;, then &quot;B&quot; is at most &quot;N C&quot;, so the time required is formula_35.

This solution does not count as polynomial time in complexity theory because formula_36 is not polynomial in the &quot;size&quot; of the problem, which is the number of bits used to represent it. This algorithm is polynomial in the values of and , which are exponential in their numbers of bits. However, Subset Sum encoded in &quot;unary&quot; is in P, since then the size of the encoding is linear in B-A. Hence, Subset Sum is only &quot;weakly&quot; NP-Complete.

For the case that each formula_37 is positive and bounded by a fixed constant , in 1999, Pisinger found a linear time algorithm having time complexity formula_38 (note that this is for the version of the problem where the target sum is not necessarily zero, as otherwise the problem would be trivial). In 2015, Koiliaris and Xu found a deterministic formula_39 algorithm for the subset sum problem where is the sum we need to find. In 2017, Bringmann found a randomized formula_40 time algorithm.

In 2014, Curtis and Sanches found a simple recursion highly scalable in SIMD machines having formula_41 time and formula_42 space, where is the number of processing elements, formula_43 and formula_44 is the lowest integer. This is the best theoretical parallel complexity known so far.

A comparison of practical results and the solution of hard instances of the SSP is discussed by Curtis and Sanches.

== Polynomial time approximation algorithms ==

Suppose all inputs are positive. An approximation algorithm to SSP aims to find a subset of &quot;S&quot; with a sum of at most &quot;T&quot; and at least &quot;r&quot; times the optimal sum, where &quot;r&quot; is a number in (0,1) called the &quot;approximation ratio&quot;.

=== Simple 1/2-approximation ===
The following very simple algorithm has an approximation ratio of 1/2:

* Order the inputs by descending value;
* Put the next-largest input into the subset, as long as it fits there.

When this algorithm terminates, either all inputs are in the subset (which is obviously optimal), or there is an input that does not fit. The first such input is smaller than all previous inputs that are in the subset and the sum of inputs in the subset is more than &quot;T&quot;/2 otherwise the input also is less than T/2 and it would fit in the set. Such a sum greater than T/2 is obviously more than OPT/2.

=== Fully-polynomial time approximation scheme ===
The following algorithm attains, for every formula_45, an approximation ratio of formula_46. Its run time is polynomial in and formula_47. Recall that &quot;n&quot; is the number of inputs and &quot;T&quot; is the upper bound to the subset sum.
 initialize a list &quot;L&quot; to contain one element 0.
 for each &quot;i&quot; from 1 to &quot;n&quot; do
 let &quot;Ui&quot; be a list containing all elements &quot;y&quot; in &quot;L&quot;, and all sums &quot;xi&quot; + &quot;y&quot; for all &quot;y&quot; in &quot;L&quot;.
 sort &quot;Ui&quot; in ascending order
 make &quot;L&quot; empty 
 let &quot;y&quot; be the smallest element of &quot;Ui&quot;
 add &quot;y&quot; to &quot;L&quot;
 for each element &quot;z&quot; of &quot;Ui&quot; in increasing order do
 // Trim the list by eliminating numbers close to one another
 // and throw out elements greater than the target sum &quot;T&quot;.
 if &quot;y&quot; + &quot;ε T&quot;/&quot;n&quot; &lt; &quot;z&quot; ≤ &quot;T&quot; then
 &quot;y&quot; = &quot;z&quot;
 add &quot;z&quot; to &quot;L&quot;
 return the largest element in &quot;L.&quot;

Note that without the trimming step (the inner &quot;for each&quot; loop), the list &quot;L&quot; would contain the sums of all formula_9 subsets of inputs. The trimming step does two things:

* It ensures that all sums remaining in &quot;L&quot; are below &quot;T&quot;, so they are feasible solutions to the subset-sum problem.
* It ensures that the list L is &quot;sparse&quot;, that is, the difference between each two consecutive partial-sums is at least formula_49. 

These properties together guarantee that the list contains no more than formula_50 elements; therefore the run-time is polynomial in formula_50.

When the algorithm ends, if the optimal sum is in , then it is returned and we are done. Otherwise, it must have been removed in a previous trimming step. Each trimming step introduces an additive error of at most formula_49, so steps together introduce an error of at most formula_53. Therefore, the returned solution is at least formula_54 which is at least formula_55 .

The above algorithm provides an &quot;exact&quot; solution to SSP in the case that the input numbers are small (and non-negative). If any sum of the numbers can be specified with at most bits, then solving the problem approximately with formula_56 is equivalent to solving it exactly. Then, the polynomial time algorithm for approximate subset sum becomes an exact algorithm with running time polynomial in and formula_57 (i.e., exponential in ).

Kellerer, Mansini, Pferschy and Speranza and Kellerer, Pferschy and Pisinger present other FPTASes for subset sum.

<text>Pericles (, ; –429 BC) was a Greek politician and general during the Golden Age of Athens. He was prominent and influential in Ancient Athenian politics, particularly between the Greco-Persian Wars and the Peloponnesian War, and was acclaimed by Thucydides, a contemporary historian, as &quot;the first citizen of Athens&quot;. Pericles turned the Delian League into an Athenian empire and led his countrymen during the first two years of the Peloponnesian War. The period during which he led Athens as Archon (ruler), roughly from 461 to 429 BC, is sometimes known as the &quot;Age of Pericles&quot;, but the period thus denoted can include times as early as the Persian Wars or as late as the following century.

Pericles promoted the arts and literature, and it was principally through his efforts that Athens acquired the reputation of being the educational and cultural center of the ancient Greek world. He started an ambitious project that generated most of the surviving structures on the Acropolis, including the Parthenon. This project beautified and protected the city, exhibited its glory, and gave work to its people. Pericles also fostered Athenian democracy to such an extent that critics called him a populist. Pericles was descended, through his mother, from the powerful and historically influential Alcmaeonid family. He, along with several members of his family, succumbed to the Plague of Athens in 429 BC, which weakened the city-state during a protracted conflict with Sparta.

== Early years ==
Pericles was born , in Athens, Greece. He was the son of the politician Xanthippus, who, though ostracized in 485–484 BC, returned to Athens to command the Athenian contingent in the Greek victory at Mycale just five years later. Pericles&#x27; mother, Agariste, was a member of the powerful and controversial noble family of the Alcmaeonidae, and her familial connections played a crucial role in helping start his political career. Agariste was the great-granddaughter of the tyrant of Sicyon, Cleisthenes, and the niece of the Athenian reformer Cleisthenes. Pericles belonged to the Attic &quot;phyle&quot; (clan) of Acamantis (). His early years were quiet; the introverted young Pericles avoided public appearances, instead preferring to devote his time to his studies.

According to Herodotus and Plutarch, Agariste dreamed, a few nights before Pericles&#x27; birth, that she had borne a lion. Legends say that Philip II of Macedon had a similar dream before the birth of his son, Alexander the Great. One interpretation of the dream treats the lion as a traditional symbol of greatness, but the story may also allude to the unusually large size of Pericles&#x27; skull, which became a popular target of contemporary comedians (who called him &quot;Squill-head&quot;, after the squill or sea-onion). Although Plutarch claims that this deformity was the reason that Pericles was always depicted wearing a helmet, this is not the case; the helmet was actually the symbol of his official rank as strategos (general).

His family&#x27;s nobility and wealth allowed him to fully pursue his inclination toward education. He learned music from the masters of the time (Damon or Pythocleides could have been his teacher) and he is considered to have been the first politician to attribute importance to philosophy. He enjoyed the company of the philosophers Protagoras, Zeno of Elea, and Anaxagoras. Anaxagoras, in particular, became a close friend and influenced him greatly.

Pericles&#x27; manner of thought and rhetorical charisma may have possibly been in part products of Anaxagoras&#x27; emphasis on emotional calm in the face of trouble, and skepticism about divine phenomena. His proverbial calmness and self-control are also often regarded as products of Anaxagoras&#x27; influence.

== Political career until 431 BC ==
=== Entering politics ===

In the spring of 472 BC, Pericles presented &quot;The Persians&quot; of Aeschylus at the Greater Dionysia as a liturgy, demonstrating that he was one of the wealthier men of Athens. Simon Hornblower has argued that Pericles&#x27; selection of this play, which presents a nostalgic picture of Themistocles&#x27; famous victory at Salamis, shows that the young politician was supporting Themistocles against his political opponent Cimon, whose faction succeeded in having Themistocles ostracized shortly afterward.

Plutarch says that Pericles stood first among the Athenians for forty years. If this was so, Pericles must have taken up a position of leadership by the early 460s BC in his early or mid-thirties. Throughout these years he endeavored to protect his privacy and to present himself as a model for his fellow citizens. For example, he would often avoid banquets, trying to be frugal.

In 463 BC, Pericles was the leading prosecutor of Cimon, the leader of the conservative faction who was accused of neglecting Athens&#x27; vital interests in Macedon. Although Cimon was acquitted, this confrontation proved that Pericles&#x27; major political opponent was vulnerable.

=== Ostracizing Cimon ===
Around 461 BC, the leadership of the democratic party decided it was time to take aim at the Areopagus, a traditional council controlled by the Athenian aristocracy, which had once been the most powerful body in the state. The leader of the party and mentor of Pericles, Ephialtes, proposed a reduction of the Areopagus&#x27; powers. The Ecclesia (the Athenian Assembly) adopted Ephialtes&#x27; proposal without opposition. This reform signaled the beginning of a new era of &quot;radical democracy&quot;.

The democratic party gradually became dominant in Athenian politics, and Pericles seemed willing to follow a populist policy to cajole the public. According to Aristotle, Pericles&#x27; stance can be explained by the fact that his principal political opponent, Cimon, was both rich and generous, and was able to gain public favor by lavishly handing out portions of his sizable personal fortune. The historian Loren J. Samons II argues, however, that Pericles had enough resources to make a political mark by private means, had he so chosen.

In 461 BC, Pericles achieved the political elimination of this opponent using ostracism. The accusation was that Cimon betrayed his city by aiding Sparta.

After Cimon&#x27;s ostracism, Pericles continued to promote a populist social policy. He first proposed a decree that permitted the poor to watch theatrical plays without paying, with the state covering the cost of their admission. With other decrees he lowered the property requirement for the archonship in 458–457 BC and bestowed generous wages on all citizens who served as jurymen in the Heliaia (the supreme court of Athens) some time just after 454 BC. His most controversial measure, however, was a law of 451 BC limiting Athenian citizenship to those of Athenian parentage on both sides.

Such measures impelled Pericles&#x27; critics to hold him responsible for the gradual degeneration of the Athenian democracy. Constantine Paparrigopoulos, a major modern Greek historian, argues that Pericles sought for the expansion and stabilization of all democratic institutions. Accordingly, he enacted legislation granting the lower classes access to the political system and the public offices, from which they had previously been barred.

According to Samons, Pericles believed that it was necessary to raise the &quot;demos&quot;, in which he saw an untapped source of Athenian power and the crucial element of Athenian military dominance. (The fleet, backbone of Athenian power since the days of Themistocles, was manned almost entirely by members of the lower classes.)

Cimon, in contrast, apparently believed that no further free space for democratic evolution existed. He was certain that democracy had reached its peak and Pericles&#x27; reforms were leading to the stalemate of populism. According to Paparrigopoulos, history vindicated Cimon, because Athens, after Pericles&#x27; death, sank into the abyss of political turmoil and demagogy. Paparrigopoulos maintains that an unprecedented regression descended upon the city, whose glory perished as a result of Pericles&#x27; populist policies.

According to another historian, Justin Daniel King, radical democracy benefited people individually, but harmed the state. In contrast, Donald Kagan asserts that the democratic measures Pericles put into effect provided the basis for an unassailable political strength. After all, Cimon finally accepted the new democracy and did not oppose the citizenship law, after he returned from exile in 451 BC.

=== Leading Athens ===
Ephialtes&#x27; murder in 461 BC paved the way for Pericles to consolidate his authority. Without opposition after the expulsion of Cimon, the unchallengeable leader of the democratic party became the unchallengeable ruler of Athens. He remained in power until his death in 429 BC.

==== First Peloponnesian War ====

Pericles made his first military excursions during the First Peloponnesian War, which was caused in part by Athens&#x27; alliance with Megara and Argos and the subsequent reaction of Sparta. In 454 BC he attacked Sicyon and Acarnania. He then unsuccessfully tried to conquer Oeniadea on the Corinthian gulf, before returning to Athens. In 451 BC, Cimon returned from exile and negotiated a five years&#x27; truce with Sparta after a proposal of Pericles, an event which indicates a shift in Pericles&#x27; political strategy. Pericles may have realized the importance of Cimon&#x27;s contribution during the ongoing conflicts against the Peloponnesians and the Persians. Anthony J. Podlecki argues, however, that Pericles&#x27; alleged change of position was invented by ancient writers to support &quot;a tendentious view of Pericles&#x27; shiftiness&quot;.

Plutarch states that Cimon struck a power-sharing deal with his opponents, according to which Pericles would carry through the interior affairs and Cimon would be the leader of the Athenian army, campaigning abroad. If it were actually made, this bargain would constitute a concession on Pericles&#x27; part that he was not a great strategist. Kagan&#x27;s view is that Cimon adapted himself to the new conditions and promoted a political marriage between Periclean liberals and Cimonian conservatives.

In the mid-450s the Athenians launched an unsuccessful attempt to aid an Egyptian revolt against Persia, which led to a prolonged siege of a Persian fortress in the Nile Delta. The campaign culminated in disaster; the besieging force was defeated and destroyed. In 451–450 BC the Athenians sent troops to Cyprus. Cimon defeated the Persians in the Battle of Salamis-in-Cyprus, but died of disease in 449 BC. Pericles is said to have initiated both expeditions in Egypt and Cyprus, although some researchers, such as Karl Julius Beloch, argue that the dispatch of such a great fleet conforms with the spirit of Cimon&#x27;s policy.

Complicating the account of this period is the issue of the Peace of Callias, which allegedly ended hostilities between the Greeks and the Persians. The very existence of the treaty is hotly disputed, and its particulars and negotiation are ambiguous. Ernst Badian believes that a peace between Athens and Persia was first ratified in 463 BC (making the Athenian interventions in Egypt and Cyprus violations of the peace), and renegotiated at the conclusion of the campaign in Cyprus, taking force again by 449–448 BC.

John Fine, in contrast, suggests that the first peace between Athens and Persia was concluded in 450–449 BC, due to Pericles&#x27; calculation that ongoing conflict with Persia was undermining Athens&#x27; ability to spread its influence in Greece and the Aegean. Kagan believes that Pericles used Callias, a brother-in-law of Cimon, as a symbol of unity and employed him several times to negotiate important agreements.

In the spring of 449 BC, Pericles proposed the Congress Decree, which led to a meeting (&quot;Congress&quot;) of all Greek states to consider the question of rebuilding the temples destroyed by the Persians. The Congress failed because of Sparta&#x27;s stance, but Pericles&#x27; intentions remain unclear. Some historians think that he wanted to prompt a confederation with the participation of all the Greek cities; others think he wanted to assert Athenian pre-eminence. According to the historian Terry Buckley the objective of the Congress Decree was a new mandate for the Delian League and for the collection of &quot;phoros&quot; (taxes).

During the Second Sacred War Pericles led the Athenian army against Delphi and reinstated Phocis in its sovereign rights on the oracle. In 447 BC Pericles engaged in his most admired excursion, the expulsion of barbarians from the Thracian peninsula of Gallipoli, to establish Athenian colonists in the region. At this time, however, Athens was seriously challenged by a number of revolts among its subjects. In 447 BC the oligarchs of Thebes conspired against the democratic faction. The Athenians demanded their immediate surrender, but after the Battle of Coronea, Pericles was forced to concede the loss of Boeotia to recover the prisoners taken in that battle. With Boeotia in hostile hands, Phocis and Locris became untenable and quickly fell under the control of hostile oligarchs.

In 446 BC, a more dangerous uprising erupted. Euboea and Megara revolted. Pericles crossed over to Euboea with his troops, but was forced to return when the Spartan army invaded Attica. Through bribery and negotiations, Pericles defused the imminent threat, and the Spartans returned home. When Pericles was later audited for the handling of public money, an expenditure of 10 talents was not sufficiently justified, since the official documents just referred that the money was spent for a &quot;very serious purpose&quot;. Nonetheless, the &quot;serious purpose&quot; (namely the bribery) was so obvious to the auditors that they approved the expenditure without official meddling and without even investigating the mystery.

After the Spartan threat had been removed, Pericles crossed back to Euboea to crush the revolt there. He then punished the landowners of Chalcis, who lost their properties. The residents of Histiaea, meanwhile, who had butchered the crew of an Athenian trireme, were uprooted and replaced by 2,000 Athenian settlers. The crisis was brought to an official end by the Thirty Years&#x27; Peace (winter of 446–445 BC), in which Athens relinquished most of the possessions and interests on the Greek mainland which it had acquired since 460 BC, and both Athens and Sparta agreed not to attempt to win over the other state&#x27;s allies.

==== Final battle with the conservatives ====
In 444 BC, the conservative and the democratic factions confronted each other in a fierce struggle. The ambitious new leader of the conservatives, Thucydides (not to be confused with the historian of the same name), accused Pericles of profligacy, criticizing the way he spent the money for the ongoing building plan. Thucydides initially managed to incite the passions of the ecclesia regarding these charges in his favor. However, when Pericles took the floor, his resolute arguments put Thucydides and the conservatives firmly on the defensive. Finally, Pericles proposed to reimburse the city for all questionable expenses from his private property, with the proviso that he would make the inscriptions of dedication in his own name. His stance was greeted with applause, and Thucydides was soundly, if unexpectedly, defeated. In 442 BC, the Athenian public voted to ostracize Thucydides from the city for 10 years and Pericles was once again the unchallenged ruler of the Athenian political arena.

==== Athens&#x27; rule over its alliance ====

Pericles wanted to stabilize Athens&#x27; dominance over its alliance and to enforce its pre-eminence in Greece. The process by which the Delian League transformed into an Athenian empire is generally considered to have begun well before Pericles&#x27; time, as various allies in the league chose to pay tribute to Athens instead of manning ships for the league&#x27;s fleet, but the transformation was speeded and brought to its conclusion by Pericles.

The final steps in the shift to empire may have been triggered by Athens&#x27; defeat in Egypt, which challenged the city&#x27;s dominance in the Aegean and led to the revolt of several allies, such as Miletus and Erythrae. Either because of a genuine fear for its safety after the defeat in Egypt and the revolts of the allies, or as a pretext to gain control of the League&#x27;s finances, Athens transferred the treasury of the alliance from Delos to Athens in 454–453 BC.

By 450–449 BC the revolts in Miletus and Erythrae were quelled and Athens restored its rule over its allies. Around 447 BC Clearchus proposed the Coinage Decree, which imposed Athenian silver coinage, weights and measures on all of the allies. According to one of the decree&#x27;s most stringent provisions, surplus from a minting operation was to go into a special fund, and anyone proposing to use it otherwise was subject to the death penalty.

It was from the alliance&#x27;s treasury that Pericles drew the funds necessary to enable his ambitious building plan, centered on the &quot;Periclean Acropolis&quot;, which included the Propylaea, the Parthenon and the golden statue of Athena, sculpted by Pericles&#x27; friend, Phidias. In 449 BC Pericles proposed a decree allowing the use of 9,000 talents to finance the major rebuilding program of Athenian temples. Angelos Vlachos, a Greek Academician, points out the use of the alliance&#x27;s treasury, initiated and executed by Pericles, as one of the largest embezzlements in human history; this misappropriation financed, however, some of the most marvellous artistic creations of the ancient world.

==== Samian War ====
The Samian War was one of the last significant military events before the Peloponnesian War. After Thucydides&#x27; ostracism, Pericles was re-elected yearly to the generalship, the only office he ever officially occupied, although his influence was so great as to make him the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the state. In 440 BC Samos went to war against Miletus over control of Priene, an ancient city of Ionia on the foot-hills of Mycale. Worsted in the war, the Milesians came to Athens to plead their case against the Samians.

When the Athenians ordered the two sides to stop fighting and submit the case to arbitration in Athens, the Samians refused. In response, Pericles passed a decree dispatching an expedition to Samos, &quot;alleging against its people that, although they were ordered to break off their war against the Milesians, they were not complying&quot;.

In a naval battle the Athenians led by Pericles and nine other generals defeated the forces of Samos and imposed on the island an Athenian administration. When the Samians revolted against Athenian rule, Pericles compelled the rebels to capitulate after a tough siege of eight months, which resulted in substantial discontent among the Athenian sailors. Pericles then quelled a revolt in Byzantium and, when he returned to Athens, gave a funeral oration to honor the soldiers who died in the expedition.

Between 438 and 436 BC Pericles led Athens&#x27; fleet in Pontus and established friendly relations with the Greek cities of the region. Pericles focused also on internal projects, such as the fortification of Athens (the building of the &quot;middle wall&quot; about 440 BC), and on the creation of new cleruchies, such as Andros, Naxos and Thurii (444 BC) as well as Amphipolis (437–436 BC).

==== Personal attacks ====

Pericles and his friends were never immune from attack, as preeminence in democratic Athens was not equivalent to absolute rule. Just before the eruption of the Peloponnesian War, Pericles and two of his closest associates, Phidias and his companion, Aspasia, faced a series of personal and judicial attacks.

Phidias, who had been in charge of all building projects, was first accused of embezzling gold meant for the statue of Athena and then of impiety, because, when he wrought the battle of the Amazons on the shield of Athena, he carved out a figure that suggested himself as a bald old man, and also inserted a very fine likeness of Pericles fighting with an Amazon.

Aspasia, who was noted for her ability as a conversationalist and adviser, was accused of corrupting the women of Athens to satisfy Pericles&#x27; perversions. The accusations against her were probably nothing more than unproven slanders, but the whole experience was very bitter for Pericles. Although Aspasia was acquitted thanks to a rare emotional outburst of Pericles, his friend Phidias died in prison according to Plutarch; however, he is also credited with the later statue of Zeus at Olympia, therefore this is debated, and another friend of his, Anaxagoras, was attacked by the ecclesia for his religious beliefs.

Beyond these initial prosecutions, the ecclesia attacked Pericles himself by asking him to justify his ostensible profligacy with, and maladministration of, public money. According to Plutarch, Pericles was so afraid of the oncoming trial that he did not let the Athenians yield to the Lacedaemonians. Beloch also believes that Pericles deliberately brought on the war to protect his political position at home. Thus, at the start of the Peloponnesian War, Athens found itself in the awkward position of entrusting its future to a leader whose pre-eminence had just been seriously shaken for the first time in over a decade.

== Peloponnesian War ==

The causes of the Peloponnesian War have been much debated, but many ancient historians lay the blame on Pericles and Athens. Plutarch seems to believe that Pericles and the Athenians incited the war, scrambling to implement their belligerent tactics &quot;with a sort of arrogance and a love of strife&quot;. Thucydides hints at the same thing, believing the reason for the war was Sparta&#x27;s fear of Athenian power and growth. However, as he is generally regarded as an admirer of Pericles, Thucydides has been criticized for bias against Sparta.

=== Prelude to the war ===
Pericles was convinced that the war against Sparta, which could not conceal its envy of Athens&#x27; pre-eminence, was inevitable if unfortunate. Therefore, he did not hesitate to send troops to Corcyra to reinforce the Corcyraean fleet, which was fighting against Corinth. In 433 BC the enemy fleets confronted each other at the Battle of Sybota and a year later the Athenians fought Corinthian colonists at the Battle of Potidaea; these two events contributed greatly to Corinth&#x27;s lasting hatred of Athens. During the same period, Pericles proposed the Megarian decree, which resembled a modern trade embargo. According to the provisions of the decree, Megarian merchants were excluded from the market of Athens and the ports in its empire. This ban strangled the Megarian economy and strained the fragile peace between Athens and Sparta, which was allied with Megara. According to George Cawkwell, a praelector in ancient history, with this decree Pericles breached the Thirty Years&#x27; Peace &quot;but, perhaps, not without the semblance of an excuse&quot;. The Athenians&#x27; justification was that the Megarians had cultivated the sacred land consecrated to Demeter and had given refuge to runaway slaves, a behavior which the Athenians considered to be impious.

After consultations with its allies, Sparta sent a deputation to Athens demanding certain concessions, such as the immediate expulsion of the Alcmaeonidae family including Pericles and the retraction of the Megarian Decree, threatening war if the demands were not met. The obvious purpose of these proposals was the instigation of a confrontation between Pericles and the people; this event, indeed, would come about a few years later. At that time, the Athenians unhesitatingly followed Pericles&#x27; instructions. In the first legendary oration Thucydides puts in his mouth, Pericles advised the Athenians not to yield to their opponents&#x27; demands, since they were militarily stronger. Pericles was not prepared to make unilateral concessions, believing that &quot;if Athens conceded on that issue, then Sparta was sure to come up with further demands&quot;. Consequently, Pericles asked the Spartans to offer a &quot;quid pro quo&quot;. In exchange for retracting the Megarian Decree, the Athenians demanded from Sparta to abandon their practice of periodic expulsion of foreigners from their territory (xenelasia) and to recognize the autonomy of its allied cities, a request implying that Sparta&#x27;s hegemony was also ruthless. The terms were rejected by the Spartans, and with neither side willing to back down, the two cities prepared for war. According to Athanasios G. Platias and Constantinos Koliopoulos, professors of strategic studies and international politics, &quot;rather than to submit to coercive demands, Pericles chose war&quot;. Another consideration that may well have influenced Pericles&#x27; stance was the concern that revolts in the empire might spread if Athens showed itself weak.

=== First year of the war (431 BC) ===

In 431 BC, while peace already was precarious, Archidamus II, Sparta&#x27;s king, sent a new delegation to Athens, demanding that the Athenians submit to Sparta&#x27;s demands. This deputation was not allowed to enter Athens, as Pericles had already passed a resolution according to which no Spartan deputation would be welcomed if the Spartans had previously initiated any hostile military actions. The Spartan army was at this time gathered at Corinth, and, citing this as a hostile action, the Athenians refused to admit their emissaries. With his last attempt at negotiation thus declined, Archidamus invaded Attica, but found no Athenians there; Pericles, aware that Sparta&#x27;s strategy would be to invade and ravage Athenian territory, had previously arranged to evacuate the entire population of the region to within the walls of Athens.

No definite record exists of how exactly Pericles managed to convince the residents of Attica to agree to move into the crowded urban areas. For most, the move meant abandoning their land and ancestral shrines and completely changing their lifestyle. Therefore, although they agreed to leave, many rural residents were far from happy with Pericles&#x27; decision. Pericles also gave his compatriots some advice on their present affairs and reassured them that, if the enemy did not plunder his farms, he would offer his property to the city. This promise was prompted by his concern that Archidamus, who was a friend of his, might pass by his estate without ravaging it, either as a gesture of friendship or as a calculated political move aimed to alienate Pericles from his constituents.

In any case, seeing the pillage of their farms, the Athenians were outraged, and they soon began to indirectly express their discontent towards their leader, who many of them considered to have drawn them into the war. Even when in the face of mounting pressure, Pericles did not give in to the demands for immediate action against the enemy or revise his initial strategy. He also avoided convening the ecclesia, fearing that the populace, outraged by the unopposed ravaging of their farms, might rashly decide to challenge the vaunted Spartan army in the field. As meetings of the assembly were called at the discretion of its rotating presidents, the &quot;prytani&quot; (singular, &quot;prytaneis&quot;), Pericles had no formal control over their scheduling; rather, the respect in which Pericles was held by the prytanies was apparently sufficient to persuade them to do as he wished. While the Spartan army remained in Attica, Pericles sent a fleet of 100 ships to loot the coasts of the Peloponnese and charged the cavalry to guard the ravaged farms close to the walls of the city. When the enemy retired and the pillaging came to an end, Pericles proposed a decree according to which the authorities of the city should put aside 1,000 talents and 100 ships, in case Athens was attacked by naval forces. According to the most stringent provision of the decree, even proposing a different use of the money or ships would entail the penalty of death. During the autumn of 431 BC, Pericles led the Athenian forces that invaded Megara and a few months later (winter of 431–430 BC) he delivered his monumental and emotional Funeral Oration, honoring the Athenians who died for their city.

=== Last military operations and death ===
In 430 BC, the army of Sparta looted Attica for a second time, but Pericles was not daunted and refused to revise his initial strategy. Unwilling to engage the Spartan army in battle, he again led a naval expedition to plunder the coasts of the Peloponnese, this time taking 100 Athenian ships with him. According to Plutarch, just before the sailing of the ships an eclipse of the sun frightened the crews, but Pericles used the astronomical knowledge he had acquired from Anaxagoras to calm them. In the summer of the same year an epidemic broke out and devastated the Athenians. The exact identity of the disease is uncertain; typhus or typhoid fever are suspected, but this has been the source of much debate. In any case, the city&#x27;s plight, caused by the epidemic, triggered a new wave of public uproar, and Pericles was forced to defend himself in an emotional final speech, a rendition of which is presented by Thucydides. This is considered to be a monumental oration, revealing Pericles&#x27; virtues but also his bitterness towards his compatriots&#x27; ingratitude. Temporarily, he managed to tame the people&#x27;s resentment and to ride out the storm, but his internal enemies&#x27; final bid to undermine him came off; they managed to deprive him of the generalship and to fine him at an amount estimated between 15 and 50 talents. Ancient sources mention Cleon, a rising and dynamic protagonist of the Athenian political scene during the war, as the public prosecutor in Pericles&#x27; trial.
Nevertheless, within just a year, in 429 BC, the Athenians not only forgave Pericles but also re-elected him as strategos. He was reinstated in command of the Athenian army and led all its military operations during 429 BC, having once again under his control the levers of power. In that year, however, Pericles witnessed in the epidemic the death of both Paralus and Xanthippus, his legitimate sons from his first wife. His morale undermined, overwhelmed with grief, Pericles wept copiously for his loss and not even the companionship of Aspasia could console him. He himself died of the plague later in the year.

Just before his death, Pericles&#x27; friends were concentrated around his bed, enumerating his virtues during peace and underscoring his nine war trophies. Pericles, though moribund, heard them and interrupted them, pointing out that they forgot to mention his fairest and greatest title to their admiration; &quot;for&quot;, said he, &quot;no living Athenian ever put on mourning because of me&quot;. Pericles lived during the first two and a half years of the Peloponnesian War and, according to Thucydides, his death was a disaster for Athens, since his successors were inferior to him; they preferred to incite all the bad habits of the rabble and followed an unstable policy, endeavoring to be popular rather than useful. With these bitter comments, Thucydides not only laments the loss of a man he admired, but he also heralds the flickering of Athens&#x27; unique glory and grandeur.

Pausanias (c. 150 AD) records (I.29) seeing the tomb of Pericles along a road near the Academy.

== Personal life ==
Pericles, following Athenian custom, was first married to one of his closest relatives, with whom he had two sons, Paralus and Xanthippus, but around 445 BC, Pericles divorced his wife. He offered her to another husband, with the agreement of her male relatives. The name of his first wife is not known; the only information about her is that she was the wife of Hipponicus, before being married to Pericles, and the mother of Callias from this first marriage.

After Pericles divorced his wife, he had a long-term relationship with Aspasia of Miletus, with whom he had a son, Pericles the Younger. While Aspasia was held in high regard by many of Athens&#x27; socialites, her status as a non-Athenian led many to attack their relationship. Even Pericles&#x27; son, Xanthippus, who had political ambitions, did not hesitate to slander his father. Nonetheless, such objections did not greatly undermine the popularity of the couple and Pericles readily fought back against accusations that his relationship with Aspasia was corrupting of Athenian society.

His sister and both his legitimate sons, Xanthippus and Paralus, died during the Plague of Athens. Just before his death, the Athenians allowed a change in the law of 451 BC that made his half-Athenian son with Aspasia, Pericles the Younger, a citizen, and legitimate heir, a striking decision considering that Pericles himself had proposed the law confining citizenship to those of Athenian parentage on both sides.

== Assessments ==
Pericles marked a whole era and inspired conflicting judgments about his significant decisions. The fact that he was at the same time a vigorous statesman, general and orator only tends to make an objective assessment of his actions more difficult.

=== Political leadership ===
Some contemporary scholars call Pericles a populist, a demagogue and a hawk, while other scholars admire his charismatic leadership. According to Plutarch, after assuming the leadership of Athens, &quot;he was no longer the same man as before, nor alike submissive to the people and ready to yield and give in to the desires of the multitude as a steersman to the breezes&quot;. It is told that when his political opponent, Thucydides, was asked by Sparta&#x27;s king, Archidamus, whether he or Pericles was the better fighter, Thucydides answered without any hesitation that Pericles was better, because even when he was defeated, he managed to convince the audience that he had won. In matters of character, Pericles was above reproach in the eyes of the ancient historians, since &quot;he kept himself untainted by corruption, although he was not altogether indifferent to money-making&quot;.

Thucydides (the historian), an admirer of Pericles, maintains that Athens was &quot;in name a democracy but, in fact, governed by its first citizen&quot;. Through this comment, the historian illustrates what he perceives as Pericles&#x27; charisma to lead, convince and, sometimes, to manipulate. Although Thucydides mentions the fining of Pericles, he does not mention the accusations against Pericles but instead focuses on Pericles&#x27; integrity. On the other hand, in one of his dialogues, Plato rejects the glorification of Pericles and declares: &quot;as I know, Pericles made the Athenians slothful, garrulous and avaricious, by starting the system of public fees&quot;.
Plutarch mentions other criticism of Pericles&#x27; leadership: &quot;many others say that the people were first led on by him into allotments of public lands, festival-grants, and distributions of fees for public services, thereby falling into bad habits, and becoming luxurious and wanton under the influence of his public measures, instead of frugal and self-sufficing&quot;.

Thucydides argues that Pericles &quot;was not carried away by the people, but he was the one guiding the people&quot;. His judgement is not unquestioned; some 20th-century critics, such as Malcolm F. McGregor and John S. Morrison, proposed that he may have been a charismatic public face acting as an advocate on the proposals of advisors, or the people themselves. According to King, by increasing the power of the people, the Athenians left themselves with no authoritative leader. During the Peloponnesian War, Pericles&#x27; dependence on popular support to govern was obvious.

=== Military achievements ===
For more than 20 years Pericles led many expeditions, mainly naval ones. Being always cautious, he never undertook of his own accord a battle involving much uncertainty and peril and he did not accede to the &quot;vain impulses of the citizens&quot;. He based his military policy on Themistocles&#x27; principle that Athens&#x27; predominance depends on its superior naval power and believed that the Peloponnesians were near-invincible on land. Pericles also tried to minimize the advantages of Sparta by rebuilding the walls of Athens, which, it has been suggested, radically altered the use of force in Greek international relations.

During the Peloponnesian War, Pericles initiated a defensive &quot;grand strategy&quot; whose aim was the exhaustion of the enemy and the preservation of the &quot;status quo&quot;. According to Platias and Koliopoulos, Athens as the strongest party did not have to beat Sparta in military terms and &quot;chose to foil the Spartan plan for victory&quot;. The two basic principles of the &quot;Periclean Grand Strategy&quot; were the rejection of appeasement (in accordance with which he urged the Athenians not to revoke the Megarian Decree) and the avoidance of overextension. According to Kagan, Pericles&#x27; vehement insistence that there should be no diversionary expeditions may well have resulted from the bitter memory of the Egyptian campaign, which he had allegedly supported. His strategy is said to have been &quot;inherently unpopular&quot;, but Pericles managed to persuade the Athenian public to follow it. It is for that reason that Hans Delbrück called him one of the greatest statesmen and military leaders in history. Although his countrymen engaged in several aggressive actions soon after his death, Platias and Koliopoulos argue that the Athenians remained true to the larger Periclean strategy of seeking to preserve, not expand, the empire, and did not depart from it until the Sicilian Expedition. For his part, Ben X. de Wet concludes his strategy would have succeeded had he lived longer.

Critics of Pericles&#x27; strategy, however, have been just as numerous as its supporters. A common criticism is that Pericles was always a better politician and orator than strategist. Donald Kagan called the Periclean strategy &quot;a form of wishful thinking that failed&quot;, Barry S. Strauss and Josiah Ober have stated that &quot;as strategist he was a failure and deserves a share of the blame for Athens&#x27; great defeat&quot;, and Victor Davis Hanson believes that Pericles had not worked out a clear strategy for an effective offensive action that could possibly force Thebes or Sparta to stop the war. Kagan criticizes the Periclean strategy on four counts: first that by rejecting minor concessions it brought about war; second, that it was unforeseen by the enemy and hence lacked credibility; third, that it was too feeble to exploit any opportunities; and fourth, that it depended on Pericles for its execution and thus was bound to be abandoned after his death. Kagan estimates Pericles&#x27; expenditure on his military strategy in the Peloponnesian War to be about 2,000 talents annually, and based on this figure concludes that he would have only enough money to keep the war going for three years. He asserts that since Pericles must have known about these limitations he probably planned for a much shorter war. Others, such as Donald W. Knight, conclude that the strategy was too defensive and would not succeed.

In contrast, Platias and Koliopoulos reject these criticisms and state that &quot;the Athenians lost the war only when they dramatically reversed the Periclean grand strategy that explicitly disdained further conquests&quot;. Hanson stresses that the Periclean strategy was not innovative, but could lead to a stagnancy in favor of Athens. It is a popular conclusion that those succeeding him lacked his abilities and character.

=== Oratorical skill ===

Modern commentators of Thucydides, with other modern historians and writers, take varying stances on the issue of how much of the speeches of Pericles, as given by this historian, do actually represent Pericles&#x27; own words and how much of them is free literary creation or paraphrase by Thucydides. Since Pericles never wrote down or distributed his orations, no historians are able to answer this with certainty; Thucydides recreated three of them from memory and, thereby, it cannot be ascertained that he did not add his own notions and thoughts.

Although Pericles was a main source of his inspiration, some historians have noted that the passionate and idealistic literary style of the speeches Thucydides attributes to Pericles is completely at odds with Thucydides&#x27; own cold and analytical writing style. This might, however, be the result of the incorporation of the genre of rhetoric into the genre of historiography. That is to say, Thucydides could simply have used two different writing styles for two different purposes.

Ioannis Kakridis and Arnold Gomme were two scholars who debated the originality of Pericles&#x27; oratory and last speech. Kakridis believes that Thucydides altered Pericles words. Some of his strongest arguments included in the Introduction of the speech, (Thuc.11.35). Kakridis proposes that it is impossible to imagine Pericles deviating away from the expected funeral orator addressing the mourning audience of 430 after the Peloponnesian war. The two groups addressed were the ones who were prepared to believe him when he praised the dead, and the ones who did not. Gomme rejects Kakridis&#x27;s position, defending the fact that &quot;Nobody of men has ever been so conscious of envy and its workings as the Greeks, and that the Greeks and Thucydides in particular had a passion for covering all ground in their generalizations, not always relevantly.&quot;
Kagan states that Pericles adopted &quot;an elevated mode of speech, free from the vulgar and knavish tricks of mob-orators&quot; and, according to Diodorus Siculus, he &quot;excelled all his fellow citizens in skill of oratory&quot;. According to Plutarch, he avoided using gimmicks in his speeches, unlike the passionate Demosthenes, and always spoke in a calm and tranquil manner. The biographer points out, however, that the poet Ion reported that Pericles&#x27; speaking style was &quot;a presumptuous and somewhat arrogant manner of address, and that into his haughtiness there entered a good deal of disdain and contempt for others&quot;.

Gorgias, in Plato&#x27;s homonymous dialogue, uses Pericles as an example of powerful oratory. In Menexenus, however, Socrates (through Plato) casts aspersions on Pericles&#x27; rhetorical fame, claiming ironically that, since Pericles was educated by Aspasia, a trainer of many orators, he would be superior in rhetoric to someone educated by Antiphon. He also attributes authorship of the Funeral Oration to Aspasia and attacks his contemporaries&#x27; veneration of Pericles.

Sir Richard C. Jebb concludes that &quot;unique as an Athenian statesman, Pericles must have been in two respects unique also as an Athenian orator; first, because he occupied such a position of personal ascendancy as no man before or after him attained; secondly, because his thoughts and his moral force won him such renown for eloquence as no one else ever got from Athenians&quot;.

Ancient Greek writers call Pericles &quot;Olympian&quot; and extol his talents; referring to him &quot;thundering and lightning and exciting Greece&quot; and carrying the weapons of Zeus when orating. According to Quintilian, Pericles would always prepare assiduously for his orations and, before going on the rostrum, he would always pray to the gods, so as not to utter any improper word.

=== Pericles and the city gods ===
Nothing was more alien to the Greeks than the notion of a Separation between church and state. In Athens, the community provided a tight framework for religious manifestations while, symmetrically, religion was deeply embedded in civic life. Within this context, participation in the rituals was an action highly political in the broadest sense of the term.

To analyze Pericles&#x27;s relations with gods, one has to position oneself at the intersection of the general and the particular, where what was personal and what was shared by the whole community came together. On the one hand, the career of the &quot;strategos&quot; will illuminate the Athenians&#x27; collective relationship to all that was divine. As a reelected &quot;strategos&quot; and a persuasive orator, Pericles was the spokesman of a civic religion that was undergoing a mutation. He was implicated in a policy of making constant offerings and of launching huge architectural religious works not only on the Acropolis but also throughout Attica; and, furthermore, he was engaged in such activities at a time when city was introducing profound changes into its religious account of its origins—that is, autochthony—within a context of strained diplomatic relations.

On the other hand, the ancient sources made it possible to glimpse the personal relations that Pericles had developed with gods. These were relations of proximity in the first place: he was sometimes depicted as a protégé of goddess Athena, but in Attic comedies he was also assimilated to god Zeus, in an analogy that was in no way flattering. But then, there were also relations that emphasized distance: some philosophical accounts presented him as a man close to the sophists or even as a freethinker. Finally, there were relations involving irreverence: some later and less trustworthy sources made much of several trials for impiety in which those close to him were involved, and this raises the question of religious tolerance in fifth-century Athens and, in particular, how far individuals enjoyed freedom of thought when faced with the civic community.

=== Legacy ===
Pericles&#x27; most visible legacy can be found in the literary and artistic works of the Golden Age, much of which survive to this day. The Acropolis, though in ruins, still stands and is a symbol of modern Athens. Paparrigopoulos wrote that these masterpieces are &quot;sufficient to render the name of Greece immortal in our world&quot;.

In politics, Victor L. Ehrenberg argues that a basic element of Pericles&#x27; legacy is Athenian imperialism, which denies true democracy and freedom to the people of all but the ruling state. The promotion of such an arrogant imperialism is said to have ruined Athens. Pericles and his &quot;expansionary&quot; policies have been at the center of arguments promoting democracy in oppressed countries.

Other analysts maintain an Athenian humanism illustrated in the Golden Age. The freedom of expression is regarded as the lasting legacy deriving from this period. Pericles is lauded as &quot;the ideal type of the perfect statesman in ancient Greece&quot; and his Funeral Oration is nowadays synonymous with the struggle for participatory democracy and civic pride.

In 1932, botanist Albert Charles Smith published &quot;Periclesia&quot;, a monotypic genus of flowering plants from Ecuador belonging to the family Ericaceae and named after Pericles.

The exterior of the ETH Zurich University Archives has a wall painting with the face of Pericles, together with Homer and Aristotle.

=== In popular culture ===

In the 1968 &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Plato&#x27;s Stepchildren&quot;, Captain Kirk is presented with the shield of Pericles by the leader of the Platonian race.

In the 2001 TV Movie &quot;Black River&quot; Pericles is the pseudonym used by the mysterious voice on the phone.

In the 2016 video game &quot;Civilization VI&quot; Pericles is one of the two playable leaders for the Greek civilization, the other being Gorgo.

In the 2018 video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey&quot; Pericles&#x27;s life as a politician and his death are both presented, although his death being from injuries sustained during a violent attack is not historically accurate.

<text>The Three Stooges were an American vaudeville and comedy team active from 1922 until 1970, best remembered for their 190 short-subject films by Columbia Pictures. Their hallmark styles were physical, farce, and slapstick comedy. Six total Stooges appeared over the act&#x27;s run (with only three active at any given time); Moe Howard (born Moses Horwitz) and Larry Fine (born Louis Feinberg) were mainstays throughout the ensemble&#x27;s nearly 50-year run, while the &quot;third stooge&quot; was played in turn by Shemp Howard (born Samuel Horwitz), Curly Howard (born Jerome Horwitz), Shemp Howard again, Joe Besser, and &quot;Curly Joe&quot; DeRita (born Joseph Wardell).

The act began in the early 1920s as part of a vaudeville comedy act billed as &quot;Ted Healy and His Stooges&quot;, consisting originally of Ted Healy and Moe Howard. Over time, they were joined by Moe&#x27;s brother, Shemp Howard, and then Larry Fine. The four appeared in one feature film, &quot;Soup to Nuts&quot;, before Shemp left to pursue a solo career. He was replaced by Moe&#x27;s younger brother, Jerome &quot;Curly&quot; Howard, in 1932. Two years later, after appearing in several movies, the trio left Healy and signed on to appear in their own short-subject comedies for Columbia Pictures, now billed as &quot;The Three Stooges&quot;. From 1934 to 1946, Moe, Larry, and Curly produced over 90 short films for Columbia.

Curly suffered a debilitating stroke in May 1946. Shemp returned, reconstituting the original lineup, until his death of a heart attack on November 22, 1955, three years and ten months after Curly&#x27;s death of a cerebral hemorrhage. Film actor Joe Palma stood in (shot from behind to obscure his face) to complete four Shemp-era shorts under contract. The procedure of disguising one actor as another outside of stunt shots became known as the &quot;fake Shemp&quot;. Columbia contract player Joe Besser joined as the third Stooge for two years (1956–1957), departing in 1958 to nurse his ill wife after Columbia terminated its shorts division. The studio then released all the shorts via Screen Gems, Columbia&#x27;s television studio and distribution unit. Screen Gems then syndicated the shorts to television, whereupon the Stooges became one of the most popular comedy acts of the early 1960s.

Comic actor Joe DeRita became &quot;Curly Joe&quot; in 1958, replacing Besser for a new series of full-length theatrical films. With intense television exposure in the United States, the act regained momentum throughout the 1960s as popular kids&#x27; fare, until Larry&#x27;s paralyzing stroke in the midst of filming a pilot for a &quot;Three Stooges&quot; TV series in January 1970. He died in January 1975 after a further series of strokes. Unsuccessful attempts were made in 1970 and 1975 to revive the act with longtime supporting actor Emil Sitka in Fine&#x27;s role, but they were each cut short—the first by a movie deal falling through and Moe&#x27;s wife persuading him to retire, the second by Moe&#x27;s death.

== History ==

=== Ted Healy and His Stooges (1922–1934) ===
The Three Stooges began in 1922 as part of a raucous vaudeville act called &quot;Ted Healy and His Stooges&quot;. The act was also known as &quot;Ted Healy and His Southern Gentlemen&quot; and &quot;Ted Healy and His Racketeers&quot;. Moe Howard joined Healy&#x27;s act in 1922, and his brother Shemp Howard came aboard a few months later. After several shifts and changes in the Stooges membership, violinist-comedian Larry Fine also joined the group sometime between 1925 and 1928. In the act, lead comedian Healy would attempt to sing or tell jokes while his noisy assistants would keep interrupting him, causing Healy to retaliate with verbal and physical abuse.

In 1930, Ted Healy and His Stooges (plus comedian Fred Sanborn) appeared in &quot;Soup to Nuts&quot;, their first Hollywood feature film, released by Fox Film Corporation. The film was not a critical success, but the Stooges&#x27; performances were singled out as memorable, leading Fox to offer the trio a contract, minus Healy. This enraged Healy, who told studio executives the Stooges were his employees, whereupon the offer was withdrawn. Howard, Fine, and Howard learned of the offer and subsequent withdrawal, and left Healy to form their own act (billed as &quot;Howard, Fine &amp; Howard&quot; or &quot;Three Lost Souls&quot;). The act quickly took off with a tour of the theater circuit. Healy attempted to stop the new act with legal action, claiming that they were using his copyrighted material. Accounts exist of Healy threatening to bomb theaters if Howard, Fine, and Howard ever performed there, which worried Shemp so much that he almost left the act; reportedly, only a pay raise kept him on board.

Healy tried to save his act by hiring replacement stooges, but they were inexperienced and not as well-received as their predecessors. Healy reached a new agreement with his former Stooges in 1932, with Moe now acting as business manager, and they were booked in a production of Jacob J. Shubert&#x27;s &quot;The Passing Show of 1932&quot;. During rehearsals, Healy received a more lucrative offer and found a loophole in his contract allowing him to leave the production. Shemp, fed up with Healy&#x27;s abrasiveness, bad temper, and heavy drinking, decided to quit the act and toured in his own comedy revue for several months.

Shemp had been working for the Vitaphone studio in Brooklyn, New York since 1931. He first appeared in movie comedies playing small roles and bits in the Roscoe Arbuckle shorts, and gradually worked his way up to star comedian. Shemp stayed with Vitaphone through 1937.

With Shemp gone, Healy and the two remaining stooges (Moe and Larry) needed a replacement, so Moe suggested his younger brother Jerry Howard. Healy reportedly took one look at Jerry, who had long chestnut-red hair and a handlebar mustache, and remarked that Jerry did not look like he was funny. Jerry left the room and returned a few minutes later with his head shaved (although his mustache remained for a time), saying: &quot;Boy, do I look girly.&quot; Healy heard &quot;Curly&quot;, and the name stuck. Other accounts have been given for how the Curly character actually came about.

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) signed Healy and his stooges to a movie contract in 1933. They appeared in feature films and short subjects together, individually, or with various combinations of actors. The trio was featured in a series of musical comedy shorts, beginning with &quot;Nertsery Rhymes&quot;. It was one of a few shorts to be made with an early two-color Technicolor process. These also included one featuring Curly without Healy or the other Stooges, &quot;Roast Beef and Movies&quot; (1934), and the recently rediscovered Technicolor short &quot;Hello Pop!&quot;. &quot;Jail Birds of Paradise&quot; (1934) was also shot in Technicolor, but as of 2022, no print has been found. The short films were built around recycled Technicolor film footage of production numbers cut from MGM musicals, such as &quot;Children of Pleasure&quot;, &quot;Lord Byron of Broadway&quot;, and the unfinished &quot;March of Time&quot; (all 1930). The studio concluded the series with standard, black-and-white two-reel subjects: &quot;Beer and Pretzels&quot; (1933) &quot;Plane Nuts&quot; (1933), and &quot;The Big Idea&quot; (1934).

Healy and company also appeared in several MGM feature films as comic relief, including:

* &quot;Turn Back the Clock&quot; (1933)
* &quot;Meet the Baron&quot; (1933)
* &quot;Dancing Lady&quot; (1933) (with Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, Fred Astaire and Robert Benchley)
* &quot;Fugitive Lovers&quot; (1934)
* &quot;Hollywood Party&quot; (1934).

Healy and the Stooges also appeared together in &quot;Myrt and Marge&quot; for Universal Pictures.

In 1934, the team&#x27;s contract expired with MGM, and the Stooges&#x27; professional association with Healy came to an end. According to Moe Howard&#x27;s autobiography, the split was precipitated by Healy&#x27;s alcoholism and abrasiveness. Their final film with Healy was MGM&#x27;s &quot;Hollywood Party&quot; (1934). Healy and the Stooges went on to separate successes, with Healy dying under mysterious circumstances in 1937.

=== Columbia years (1934–1958) ===

==== Moe, Larry, and Curly (1934–1946) ====

In 1934, the trio—now officially named &quot;The Three Stooges&quot;—contracted with Columbia Pictures for a series of two-reel comedy short subjects. Moe wrote in his autobiography that they each received $600 per week (equal to $ today) on a one-year contract with a renewable option; in the Ted Okuda–Edward Watz book &quot;The Columbia Comedy Shorts&quot;, the Stooges are said to have received $1,000 among them for their first Columbia effort, &quot;Woman Haters&quot; (1934), and then signed a term contract for $7,500 per film (equal to $ today), to be divided among the trio.

Within their first year at Columbia, theater bookings for the Stooges films took off. Columbia Pictures president Harry Cohn was able to use the Stooges as leverage, as the demand for their films was so great that he eventually refused to supply exhibitors with the trio&#x27;s shorts unless they also agreed to book some of the studio&#x27;s mediocre B movies. Cohn also saw to it that the Stooges remained unaware of their popularity. During their 23 years at Columbia, the Stooges were never completely aware of their drawing power. Their contracts with the studio included an open option that had to be renewed yearly, and Cohn would tell them that the short subjects were in decline, which was not a complete fabrication (Cohn&#x27;s yearly mantra was &quot;the market for comedy shorts is dying out, fellas&quot;).

The Stooges thought that their days were numbered and would sweat it out each year, with Cohn renewing their contract at the last moment. This deception kept the insecure Stooges unaware of their true value, resulting in them having second thoughts about asking for a better contract without a yearly option. Cohn&#x27;s scare tactics worked for all 23 years that the Stooges were at Columbia; the team never once asked for or received a salary increase.

After they stopped making the shorts in December 1957, Moe learned of Cohn&#x27;s tactics, what a valuable commodity the Stooges had been for the studio, and how many millions more the act could have earned. Columbia offered theater owners an entire program of two-reel comedies (15–25 titles annually) featuring such stars as Buster Keaton, Andy Clyde, Charley Chase, and Hugh Herbert, but the Stooge shorts were the most popular of all.

The Stooges&#x27; release schedule was eight short subjects per year, filmed within a 40-week period; for the remaining 12 weeks, they were free to pursue other employment, time that was either spent with their families or touring the country with their live act. The Stooges appeared in 190 film shorts and five features while at Columbia, outlasting every one of their contemporaries employed in the short-film genre. Del Lord directed more than three dozen Stooge films, Jules White directed dozens more, and his brother Jack White directed several under the pseudonym &quot;Preston Black&quot;. Silent-comedy star Charley Chase also shared directorial responsibilities with Lord and White.

The Stooge films made between 1935 and 1941 captured the team at their peak, according to film historians Ted Okuda and Edward Watz, authors of &quot;The Columbia Comedy Shorts&quot;; nearly every film produced became a classic in its own right. &quot;Hoi Polloi&quot; (1935) adapted the premise of &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, with a stuffy professor making a bet that he can transform the uncultured trio into refined gentlemen; the plotline worked so well that it was reused twice, as &quot;Half-Wits Holiday&quot; (1947) and &quot;Pies and Guys&quot; (1958). &quot;Three Little Beers&quot; (1935) featured the Stooges running amok on a golf course to win prize money. &quot;Disorder in the Court&quot; (1936) features the team as star witnesses in a murder trial. &quot;Violent Is the Word for Curly&quot; (1938) was a quality Chase-directed short that featured the musical interlude &quot;Swingin&#x27; the Alphabet&quot;.

In &quot;A Plumbing We Will Go&quot; (1940)—one of the team&#x27;s quintessential comedies—the Stooges are cast as plumbers who nearly destroy a socialite&#x27;s mansion, causing water to exit every appliance in the home, including an early television set. This was remade twice, as &quot;Vagabond Loafers&quot; and &quot;Scheming Schemers&quot;. Other entries of the era are considered among the team&#x27;s finest work, including &quot;Uncivil Warriors&quot; (1935), &quot;A Pain in the Pullman&quot; and &quot;False Alarms&quot; (both 1936), &quot;Grips, Grunts and Groans&quot;, &quot;The Sitter Downers&quot;, &quot;Dizzy Doctors&quot; (all 1937), &quot;Tassels in the Air&quot; (1938), &quot;We Want Our Mummy&quot; (1939), &quot;Nutty but Nice&quot; (1940), and &quot;An Ache in Every Stake&quot; and &quot;In the Sweet Pie and Pie&quot; (both 1941).

With the onset of World War II, the Stooges released several entries that poked fun at the rising Axis powers. &quot;You Nazty Spy!&quot; (1940) and its sequel &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Heil Again&quot; (1941) lampooned Hitler and the Nazis at a time when America was still neutral. Moe was cast as &quot;Moe Hailstone&quot;, an Adolf Hitler-like character, with Curly playing a Hermann Göring character, replete with medals, and Larry a Joseph Goebbels-type propaganda minister. Moe, Larry, and director Jules White considered &quot;You Nazty Spy!&quot; their best film. Yet, these efforts indulged in a deliberately formless, non-sequitur style of verbal humor that was not the Stooges&#x27; forte, according to Okuda and Watz.

Other wartime entries have their moments, such as &quot;They Stooge to Conga&quot; (considered the most violent Stooge short), &quot;Higher Than a Kite&quot;, &quot;Back from the Front&quot; (all 1943), &quot;Gents Without Cents&quot; (1944) and the anti-Japanese &quot;The Yoke&#x27;s on Me&quot; (also 1944). However, taken in bulk, the wartime films are considered less funny than what preceded them. &quot;No Dough Boys&quot; (1944) is often considered the best of these farces. The team, made up as Japanese soldiers for a photo shoot, is mistaken for genuine saboteurs by a Nazi ringleader (Vernon Dent, the Stooges&#x27; primary foil). The highlight of the film features the Stooges engaging in nonsensical gymnastics for a skeptical group of enemy agents expecting renowned acrobats.

Wartime also brought on rising production costs that resulted in fewer elaborate gags and outdoor sequences, Del Lord&#x27;s stock in trade; as a result, the quality of the team&#x27;s films, particularly those directed by Lord, began to slip after 1942. According to Okuda and Watz, entries such as &quot;Loco Boy Makes Good&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s the Matador?&quot;, &quot;Sock-a-Bye Baby&quot; (all 1942), &quot;I Can Hardly Wait&quot; and &quot;A Gem of a Jam&quot; (both 1943) are considered to be lesser-quality works than previous films. &quot;Spook Louder&quot; (1943), a remake of Mack Sennett&#x27;s &quot;The Great Pie Mystery&quot; (1931), is sometimes considered one of their weakest shorts because of its repetitious and rehashed jokes. &quot;Three Smart Saps&quot; (1942), was an improvement, reworking a routine from Harold Lloyd&#x27;s &quot;The Freshman&quot; (1925), in which Curly&#x27;s loosely stitched suit begins to fall apart at the seams while he is on the dance floor.

The Stooges made occasional supporting appearances in feature films. Most of the Stooges&#x27; peers had either made the transition from shorts to feature films (Laurel and Hardy, The Ritz Brothers) or starred in their own feature films from the onset (Marx Brothers, Abbott and Costello). However, Moe believed that the team&#x27;s slapstick style worked better in short form. In 1935, Columbia proposed to star them in their own full-length feature, but Moe rejected the idea, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s a hard job inventing, rewriting, or stealing gags for our two-reel comedies for Columbia Pictures without having to make a seven-reeler (feature film). We can make short films out of material needed for a starring feature, and then we wouldn&#x27;t know whether it would be funny enough to click.&quot;

Film critics have cited Curly as the most popular member of the team. His childlike mannerisms, natural comedic charm, and uncouth, juvenile humor made him a hit with audiences, particularly women and children. However, Curly having to shave his head for the act led him to feel unappealing to women. To mask his insecurities, he ate and drank to excess and caroused whenever the Stooges made personal appearances, which was around seven months of each year. His weight ballooned in the 1940s, and his blood pressure became dangerously high. Curly&#x27;s wild lifestyle and constant drinking eventually caught up with him in 1945, and his performances suffered.

During a five-month hiatus from August 1945 through January 1946, the trio committed themselves to making a feature film at Monogram, followed by two months of live appearances in New York City, with performances seven days a week. Curly also entered a disastrous third marriage in October 1945, leading to a separation in January 1946 and divorce in July 1946, at great cost to his already fragile health. Upon the Stooges&#x27; return to Los Angeles in late November 1945, Curly was a shell of his former self. They had two months to rest before reporting back to Columbia in late January 1946, but Curly&#x27;s condition was irreversible. They had only 24 days of work over the next three months, but eight weeks of time off could not help the situation. In those last six shorts, ranging from &quot;Monkey Businessmen&quot; (1946) through &quot;Half-Wits Holiday&quot; (1947), Curly was seriously ill, struggling to get through even the most basic scenes.

During the final day of filming &quot;Half-Wits Holiday&quot; (1947) on May 6, 1946, Curly suffered a debilitating stroke on the set, ending his 14-year career. They hoped for a full recovery, but Curly never appeared in a film again except for a single cameo appearance in the third film after Shemp returned to the trio, &quot;Hold That Lion!&quot; (1947). It was the only film that contained all four of the original Stooges (the three Howard brothers and Larry) on screen simultaneously. According to Jules White, this came about when Curly visited the set one day, and White had him do this bit for fun. Curly&#x27;s cameo appearance was recycled in the remake &quot;Booty and the Beast&quot;, released in 1953.

In 1949, Curly filmed a brief scene for &quot;Malice in the Palace&quot; (1949) as the restaurant&#x27;s cook, but it was not used. Jules White&#x27;s copy of the script contained the dialogue for this missing scene, and a production still of Curly does exist, appearing on both the film&#x27;s original one-sheet and lobby card. Larry played the role of the cook in the final print.

==== Shemp&#x27;s return (1946–1955) ====

Moe asked his older brother Shemp to take Curly&#x27;s place, but Shemp was hesitant to rejoin the Stooges, as he was enjoying a successful solo career. He realized, however, that not rejoining the Stooges would mean the end of Moe and Larry&#x27;s film careers. Shemp wanted assurances that rejoining them would be only temporary and that he could leave the Stooges once Curly recovered. However, Curly&#x27;s health continued to deteriorate, and it became clear that he could not return. As a result, Shemp resumed being a Stooge full-time for nearly a decade. Curly remained ill until his death of a cerebral hemorrhage from additional strokes on January 18, 1952.

Shemp appeared with the Stooges in 76 shorts and a low-budget Western comedy feature titled &quot;Gold Raiders&quot; (1951) in which the screen time was evenly divided with cowboy hero George O&#x27;Brien. Shemp&#x27;s return improved the quality of the films, as the previous few had been marred by Curly&#x27;s sluggish performances. Entries such as &quot;Out West&quot; (1947), &quot;Squareheads of the Round Table&quot; (1948), and &quot;Punchy Cowpunchers&quot; (1950) proved that Shemp could hold his own. New director Edward Bernds, who joined the team in 1945 when Curly was failing, sensed that routines and plotlines that worked well with Curly as the comic focus did not fit Shemp&#x27;s persona, and allowed the comedian to develop his own Stooge character. Jules White, however, persisted in employing the &quot;living cartoon&quot; style of comedy that reigned during the Curly era, forcing either Shemp or Moe to perform lackluster imitations of gags and mannerisms that originated from Curly. Most acutely, it created the &quot;Curly vs. Shemp&quot; debate that overshadowed the act upon Curly&#x27;s departure. The Stooges lost some of their charm and inherent appeal to children after Curly retired, but some excellent films were produced with Shemp, an accomplished solo comedian who often performed best when allowed to improvise on his own.

The films from the Shemp era contrast sharply with those from the Curly era, largely owing to the individual directing styles of Edward Bernds and Jules White. From 1947 to 1952, Bernds hit a string of successes, including &quot;Fright Night&quot; (1947), &quot;The Hot Scots&quot;, &quot;Mummy&#x27;s Dummies&quot;, &quot;Crime on Their Hands&quot; (all 1948), &quot;Three Arabian Nuts&quot; (1951), and &quot;Gents in a Jam&quot; (1952). Three of the team&#x27;s finest efforts were directed by Bernds: &quot;Brideless Groom&quot; (1947), &quot;Who Done It?&quot; (1949), and &quot;Punchy Cowpunchers&quot; (Bernds&#x27;s own favorite, 1950). White also contributed a few fair entries, such as &quot;Hold That Lion!&quot; (1947), &quot;Hokus Pokus&quot; (1949), &quot;Scrambled Brains&quot; (1951), &quot;A Missed Fortune&quot;, and &quot;Corny Casanovas&quot; (both 1952).

Another benefit from the Shemp era was that Larry was given more time on screen. Throughout most of the Curly era, Larry was relegated to a background role, but by the time that Shemp rejoined the Stooges, Larry was allotted equal time, even becoming the focus of several films, in particular &quot;Fuelin&#x27; Around&quot; (1949) and &quot;He Cooked His Goose&quot; (1952).

The Shemp years also marked a major milestone: the Stooges&#x27; first appearance on television. In 1948, they guest-starred on Milton Berle&#x27;s popular &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot; and Morey Amsterdam&#x27;s &quot;The Morey Amsterdam Show&quot;. By 1949, the team filmed a pilot for ABC-TV for their own weekly television series, titled &quot;Jerks of All Trades&quot;. Columbia Pictures blocked the series from going into production, but allowed the Stooges to make television guest appearances. The team went on to appear on &quot;Camel Comedy Caravan&quot; (also known as &quot;The Ed Wynn Show&quot;), &quot;The Kate Smith Hour&quot;, &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot;, &quot;The Frank Sinatra Show&quot;, and &quot;The Eddie Cantor Comedy Theatre&quot;, among others.

In 1952, the Stooges lost some key players at Columbia Pictures. The studio decided to downsize its short-subject division, resulting in producer Hugh McCollum being discharged and director Edward Bernds resigning out of loyalty to McCollum, and having had creative differences with Jules White. Screenwriter Elwood Ullman, who had worked closely with Bernds, also resigned. Bernds&#x27;s departure left only White to direct the Stooges&#x27; remaining Columbia comedies. Not long after, the quality of the team&#x27;s output markedly declined, with producer-director White now assuming complete control over production. &quot;DVD Talk&quot; critic Stuart Galbraith IV commented that &quot;the Stooges&#x27; shorts became increasingly mechanical...and frequently substituted violent sight gags for story and characterization.&quot; Production was also significantly faster, with the former four-day filming schedules now tightened to two or three days. In another cost-cutting measure, White created a &quot;new&quot; Stooge short by borrowing footage from old ones, setting it in a slightly different storyline and filming a few new scenes, often with the same actors in the same costumes. White was initially very subtle when recycling older footage; he would reuse only a single sequence of old film, re-edited so cleverly that it was not easy to detect. The later shorts were cheaper and the recycling more obvious, with as much as 75% of the running time consisting of old footage. White came to rely so much on older material that he could film the &quot;new&quot; shorts in a single day. New footage filmed to link older material suffered from White&#x27;s heavy-handed directing style and penchant for telling his actors how to act. Shemp, in particular, disliked working with White after 1952, when White was the Stooges&#x27; only director.

Three years after Curly&#x27;s death, Shemp Howard died of a heart attack at age 60 on November 22, 1955, during a taxi ride home with a friend after attending a boxing match. Moe was stunned and contemplated disbanding the Stooges. Columbia, though, had promised exhibitors eight Stooge shorts for the year but only four had been completed, forcing producer Jules White to manufacture four more shorts &quot;with Shemp&quot;. Old footage of Shemp was combined with new footage of Columbia supporting player Joe Palma doubling for him (see Fake Shemp). These last four films were &quot;Rumpus in the Harem&quot;, &quot;Hot Stuff&quot;, &quot;Scheming Schemers&quot;, and &quot;Commotion on the Ocean&quot; (all released in 1956).

==== Joe Besser replaces Shemp (1956–1958) ====
Columbia was the last studio still producing live-action two-reel comedies; Warner Bros. ended its one-reel &quot;Joe McDoakes&quot; series in 1956, and the market for comedy shorts had all but ceased. As a result, Jules White told Columbia president Harry Cohn that he was shutting down the two-reel-comedy department. White canceled all of his comedy-shorts series in 1956, but Cohn insisted on keeping the Stooge comedies coming. In his own way, Cohn was sentimental about the team; Larry Fine recalled that Cohn once told the Stooges, &quot;As long as I&#x27;m president, you&#x27;ve got a job at Columbia.&quot;

By this time, Moe Howard and Larry Fine were carrying the short-subject series as a two-man team, with Shemp Howard seen entirely in older footage. Larry suggested that he and Moe could continue working as &quot;The Two Stooges.&quot; Columbia flatly refused, having promoted the team as &quot;The Three Stooges&quot; for decades, and Moe was forced to recruit a third Stooge. Several comedians were considered, including burlesque comic and former Ted Healy stooge Paul &quot;Mousie&quot; Garner, and noted African-American comedian Mantan Moreland, but Columbia insisted on a comedian already under contract to the studio. They agreed on Joe Besser, who appeared in the final 16 Stooge shorts at Columbia. Besser had been starring in his own short-subject comedies for the studio since 1949 and appeared in supporting roles in a variety of movies, making his persona sufficiently well known.

Besser had observed how one side of Larry Fine&#x27;s face appeared &quot;calloused&quot;, so he had a clause in his contract specifically prohibiting him from being hit beyond an infrequent tap, though this restriction was later lifted. &quot;I usually played the kind of character who would hit others back,&quot; Besser recalled.

Despite Besser&#x27;s prolific film and stage career, Stooge entries featuring him have often been considered the team&#x27;s weakest. During his tenure, the films were assailed as questionable models for youth, and in response began to resemble television sitcoms. Sitcoms, however, were available for free on television, quickly making the short film an artifact of a bygone era. Besser was a talented comic, and was quite popular as &quot;Stinky&quot; on &quot;The Abbott and Costello Show&quot;, but his whining mannerisms and resistance to slapstick punishment did not match the films&#x27; established format of continuous physical comedy. His presence, though, did create verbal friction between Moe and Larry, improving their mutually insulting banter.

The Besser Stooge shorts were of inconsistent quality, alternating between fresh, original material and tired rehashes. Fully half of these shorts contained all-new scripts, experimenting with science-fiction, fantasy, and musical-comedy formats. The other eight scripts were remakes, based on earlier Stooge comedies. Budgets were lower than ever, and Moe and Larry&#x27;s advanced ages prohibited them from performing much of their trademark physical comedy. Besser had suggested that Moe and Larry comb their hair back to give them a more gentlemanly appearance; while both Moe and Jules White approved of the idea, they used it sparingly. Their other films—remakes of older comedies—required the familiar Stooge haircuts to match the older footage.

In general, the remakes among the Besser shorts had the traditional Stooges knockabout, such as 1958&#x27;s &quot;Pies and Guys&quot; (a scene-for-scene remake of &quot;Half-Wits Holiday&quot;, which itself was a reworking of the earlier &quot;Hoi Polloi&quot;), &quot;Guns a Poppin&quot; (1957), &quot;Rusty Romeos&quot; (1957), and &quot;Triple Crossed&quot; (1959). In contrast, &quot;Hoofs and Goofs&quot; and &quot;Horsing Around&quot;, both featuring a trained horse, and &quot;Muscle Up a Little Closer&quot; (all 1957) mostly resembled the sitcoms of the era. &quot;A Merry Mix Up&quot; (1957) cast the Stooges as three sets of triplets, and &quot;Oil&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot; (1958) had no supporting cast at all, with the Stooges working entirely by themselves for the only time in their Columbia career. The musical &quot;Sweet and Hot&quot; (1958) deserves some credit for straying from the norm. The American science-fiction craze also led to three entries focusing on space travel: &quot;Space Ship Sappy&quot;, &quot;Outer Space Jitters&quot; (both 1957), and &quot;Flying Saucer Daffy&quot; (1958).

Jules White finally closed the comedy-shorts unit at the end of 1957. His final Stooge comedy was &quot;Flying Saucer Daffy&quot;, filmed December 19–20, 1957. Within the week, the Stooges were fired from Columbia Pictures after 24 years of employment.

No formal goodbyes or congratulatory celebrations occurred in recognition of their work and of the money that their comedies had earned for the studio. Moe visited Columbia several weeks after the dismissal to say goodbye to several executives, but was refused entry without the current year&#x27;s studio pass. He later stated that it was a crushing blow to his pride.

The studio had enough completed Stooge films to be released over the next 18 months, though not in the order in which they were produced. The final Stooge release, &quot;Sappy Bull Fighters&quot;, did not reach theaters until June 4, 1959. With no active contract in place, Moe and Larry discussed plans for a personal-appearance tour. In the meantime, Besser&#x27;s wife suffered a minor heart attack and he preferred to stay local, leading him to withdraw from the act.

=== Comeback with Joe DeRita (1958–1970) ===
After Besser&#x27;s departure, Moe and Larry began looking for potential replacements. Larry suggested former Ted Healy stooge Paul &quot;Mousie&quot; Garner, but based on his tryout performance, Moe later remarked that he was &quot;completely unacceptable.&quot; Weeks later, Larry came across burlesque performer Joe DeRita, who had starred in his own series of shorts at Columbia back in the 1940s, and thought he would be a good fit.

The early days of television provided movie studios a place to unload a backlog of short films that they thought no longer marketable, and the Stooge films seemed perfect for the burgeoning genre. ABC had even expressed interest as far back as 1949, purchasing exclusive rights to 30 of the trio&#x27;s shorts and commissioning a pilot for a potential series, &quot;Jerks of All Trades&quot;. However, the success of television revivals for such names as Laurel and Hardy, Woody Woodpecker, Popeye, Tom and Jerry, and the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series in the late 1950s led Columbia to cash in again on the Stooges. In September 1958, Columbia&#x27;s television subsidiary Screen Gems offered a package consisting of 78 Stooge shorts (primarily from the Curly era), which were well received.

An additional 40 shorts hit the market in April 1959. By September 1959, all 190 Stooge shorts were airing regularly. With so many films available for broadcast, daily television airings provided heavy exposure aimed squarely at children. Parents who had grown up seeing the same films in the theaters began to watch alongside their children. 

After the Curly-era shorts were found to be the most popular, Moe suggested that DeRita shave his head to accentuate his slight resemblance to Curly Howard. He adopted first a crew cut and later a completely shaven head, thus becoming &quot;Curly Joe&quot;. Howard, Fine, and DeRita found themselves in great demand for personal appearances and guest shots on television. DeRita made his first nationwide appearance with the Stooges on Sunday, January 11, 1959, on the Steve Allen variety show on NBC; the Stooges re-created their &quot;Stand-In&quot; sketch, with Moe and Larry making a western movie and Curly Joe (who did not speak) as the hapless double who takes all the punishment. 

Columbia, which was still releasing Stooge shorts to theaters, cashed in on the Stooges&#x27; spectacular show-business comeback by signing the team for new feature-length films. The first, &quot;Have Rocket, Will Travel&quot; (1959), was produced by the Stooges&#x27; agent, Harry Romm. The second was a quickie compilation film produced by Romm, &quot;Stop! Look! and Laugh!&quot; (1960), with &quot;The Original Three Stooges&quot; seen entirely in old short-subject extracts with Curly Howard, and new footage with ventriloquist Paul Winchell and animal act The Marquis Chimps. 

The Stooges were hired by Twentieth Century-Fox to co-star in a Technicolor feature with Olympic skater Carol Heiss; &quot;Snow White and the Three Stooges&quot; (1961), co-written by Noel Langley of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, fell short of box office expectations, ultimately losing $2,300,000 when the domestic and international returns were tallied. The Stooges resumed making their new kiddie-matinée features, which were now produced independently by Moe&#x27;s son-in-law Norman Maurer and released through Columbia: &quot;The Three Stooges Meet Hercules&quot; (1962), &quot;The Three Stooges in Orbit&quot; (1962), &quot;The Three Stooges Go Around the World in a Daze&quot; (1963), and &quot;The Outlaws is Coming!&quot; (1965).

The team had an extremely brief cameo in the film &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963), appearing as firemen. They appeared in a larger capacity in 1963 in &quot;4 for Texas&quot; starring Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. Throughout the early 1960s, the Stooges were one of the most popular and highest-paid live acts in America. They played theaters, summer festivals, fairgrounds, and other venues, and twice performed as the featured act at the Canadian National Exhibition. In 1968, they toured Hawaii where they starred in the International 3-Ring Circus at the Honolulu International Center.

The Stooges also tried their hand at another weekly television series in 1960 titled &quot;The Three Stooges Scrapbook&quot;, filmed in color and with a laugh track. The first episode, &quot;Home Cooking&quot;, featured the boys rehearsing for a new television show. Like &quot;Jerks of All Trades&quot; in 1949, the pilot did not sell, though Norman Maurer was able to reuse the footage (reprocessed in black and white) for the first 10 minutes of &quot;The Three Stooges in Orbit&quot;.

The trio also filmed 41 short comedy skits for &quot;The New 3 Stooges&quot; in 1965, which features a series of 156 animated cartoons produced for television. The Stooges appeared in live-action color footage, which preceded and followed each animated adventure in which they voiced their respective characters.

During this period, the Stooges appeared on numerous television shows, including &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;, &quot;Here&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Masquerade Party&quot;, &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;Danny Thomas Meets the Comics&quot;, &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot;, &quot;Off to See the Wizard&quot;, and &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot;.

=== Final years (1970–1975) ===
In late 1969, Howard, Fine, and DeRita began production on another half-hour pilot, this time for a syndicated 39-episode TV series titled &quot;Kook&#x27;s Tour&quot;, a combination travelogue-sitcom that had the &quot;retired&quot; Stooges traveling to various parts of the world with the episodes filmed on location. On January 9, 1970, during production of the pilot, Larry suffered a paralyzing stroke, ending his acting career along with plans for the television series. The pilot was unfinished and several key shots were missing, but producer Norman Maurer edited the available footage and made the pilot a 52-minute special that was released to the home-movie and Cartrivision videocassette home-video markets in 1973. It is the last film in which the Stooges appeared and the last known performance of the team.

Following Larry Fine&#x27;s stroke, plans were made for Emil Sitka (a longtime &quot;straight man&quot; in the Stooges films) to replace him in a new feature film, written by Moe Howard&#x27;s grandson, Jeffrey Scott [Maurer], titled &quot;Make Love, Not War&quot;. Moe Howard, Joe DeRita, and Emil Sitka were cast as POWs in a World War II Japanese prison camp, plotting an escape with fellow prisoners. The film would have been a departure from typical Stooge fare, with dark-edged humor and scenes of war violence, but insufficient funding prevented production from advancing beyond the script stage. 

Also in 1970, Joe DeRita recruited vaudeville veterans Frank Mitchell and Mousie Garner to tour as &quot;The New Three Stooges&quot;. Garner had worked with Ted Healy as one of his &quot;replacement stooges&quot; decades earlier and was briefly considered as Joe Besser&#x27;s replacement in 1958. Mitchell had appeared in two of the Stooges&#x27; short subjects in 1953. The act fared poorly, with minimal bookings. By this time, Moe&#x27;s wife had prevailed on him to retire from performing slapstick due to his age. For the next several years, Moe appeared regularly on talk shows and did speaking engagements at colleges, while DeRita quietly retired.

Larry suffered another stroke in mid-December 1974, and another one in January 1975, even more severe. After slipping into a coma, he died a week later from a cerebral hemorrhage on January 24, 1975.

Before Larry&#x27;s death, the Stooges were scheduled to co-star in the R-rated comedy &quot;Blazing Stewardesses,&quot; featuring Moe and Curly Joe with Emil Sitka in the middle spot as Harry, Larry&#x27;s brother. The team was signed and publicity shots were taken, but one week prior to March&#x27;s filming date, Moe was diagnosed with lung cancer and the Stooges had to back out; he died on May 4, 1975. Producer Sam Sherman briefly considered having former Stooge Joe Besser appear in his place, but ultimately decided against it. Another veteran comedy team, The Ritz Brothers, Harry and Jimmy, replaced the Stooges and performed much of their own schtick, including the precision dance routine first seen in &quot;Sing, Baby, Sing&quot; (1936), co-starring original Stooge leader Ted Healy.

As for the remaining original replacement stooges, Joe Besser died of heart failure on March 1, 1988, followed by Joe DeRita&#x27;s death of pneumonia on July 3, 1993. Emil Sitka was announced as a Stooge, but never performed as such beyond posing for a few publicity photographs in character; he died on January 16, 1998, six months after being disabled by a stroke.

== Legacy and perspective ==
Over 60 years since their last short film was released, the Three Stooges remain popular. Their films have never left American television since first appearing in 1958. Authors Ted Okuda and Edward Watz assess the Stooges as hard-working comedians who were never critics&#x27; favorites, a durable act that endured several personnel changes in careers that would have permanently sidelined a less persistent act. They would not have lasted as long as they did as a unit without Moe Howard&#x27;s guiding hand.

Okuda and Watz&#x27;s book &quot;The Columbia Comedy Shorts&quot; puts the Stooges&#x27; act in critical perspective:

Beginning in the 1980s, the Stooges finally began to receive critical recognition. The release of nearly all their films on DVD by 2010 allowed critics of Joe Besser and Joe DeRita—often the recipients of significant fan backlash—to appreciate both men&#x27;s unique styles of comedy. The DVD market has also allowed fans to view the entire Stooge film corpus as distinct periods in their long career, rather than unfairly comparing one Stooge to another (the Curly vs. Shemp debate continues to this day, with Joe Besser not even mentioned in the same breath).

The team appeared in 220 films, but authors Okuda and Watz agree that their series of 190 two-reel comedies for Columbia is their enduring legacy. In 1984, American television personality Steve Allen said, &quot;Although they never achieved widespread critical acclaim, they did succeed in accomplishing what they had always intended to do: They made people laugh.&quot;

==Social commentary, satire, and use of language==

Although the Three Stooges&#x27; slapstick comedy was primarily arranged around basic plots dealing with mundane issues of daily life, a number of their shorts featured social commentary or satire. They were often antiheroical commentators on class divisions and economic hardships of the Great Depression in the United States. They were usually under- or unemployed and sometimes homeless or living in shanty towns.

The language used by the Three Stooges was more slang-laden than that of typical feature films of the period and deliberately affected a lower-class status with use of crude terms, ethnic mannerisms, and inside jokes.

An example is the use of the initials A.K. for big shots and pretentious people. A.K. was an inside joke which stood for &quot;Alte Kocker&quot; (an elderly person who is defecating), a Yiddish idiom that means an old man or woman of diminished capacity who can no longer do things they used to do.

Much of the seeming &quot;gibberish&quot; that the Stooges sometimes spoke was actually the Yiddish language of their Jewish ancestry. The most famous example occurs 15 minutes into the 1938 short &quot;Mutts to You&quot;. Moe and Larry were impersonating Chinese laundrymen in an attempt to fool the local cop. While being questioned, Larry says &quot;&quot;Ech bin &quot;a China &quot;Boychic&quot; from Slobatkya-Gebernya &quot;hak mir nisht Ken Tshaynik&quot; and I don&#x27;t mean &quot;Efsher&quot;&quot;. This translates as &quot;I&#x27;m a China boy from Slobatkya Gebernya [a made-up area in eastern Russia], so stop annoying me and I don&#x27;t mean maybe.&quot;

A third &quot;in-Yiddish&quot; joke is in the episode &quot;Pardon My Scotch&quot;, when the liquor supplier prepares to consume the Stooges&#x27; volatile concoction, and they wish him well in a triad pattern saying &quot;Over the river,&quot; &quot;Skip the gutter,&quot; and concluding with &quot;&quot;Ver geharget&quot;,&quot; a Yiddish expression meaning &quot;get killed&quot; or &quot;drop dead&quot;.

One important area of political commentary was in the area of the rise of totalitarianism in Europe, notably in the directly satirical &quot;You Nazty Spy!&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Heil Again&quot;, both released before United States&#x27; entry into World War II, despite an industry Production Code that advocated avoiding social and political issues and the negative portrayal of foreign countries.

In their classic 1940 short &quot;No Census, No Feelings&quot;, the Stooges refer to Will H. Hays and his position as Hollywood&#x27;s censor, when Moe tells Curly, &quot;We have a job now, we&#x27;re working for the census&quot;, and Curly replies, &quot;You mean Will Hays?&quot;

== Lineups on film ==
=== Timeline ===
== Filmography ==
The Three Stooges appeared in 220 films through their career. Of those, 190 short films were made for Columbia Pictures, for which the trio are best known today. Their first Columbia film, &quot;Woman Haters&quot;, premiered on May 5, 1934. Their contract was extended each year until the final one expired on December 31, 1957. Columbia continued to release the Stooge shorts filmed in 1957; the final release, &quot;Sappy Bull Fighters&quot;, premiered on June 4, 1959.

== C3 Entertainment, Inc. ==

In 1959, Comedy III Productions (later, C3 Entertainment) was formed by Moe, Larry, and Joe DeRita to manage all business and merchandise transactions. Now controlled by DeRita&#x27;s heirs, it has diversified into a brand-management company licensing personality rights to various nostalgia acts, including the Stooges.

== Television ==

A handful of Three Stooges shorts first aired on television in 1949, on the ABC network. By 1958, Screen Gems packaged 78 shorts for national syndication; the package was gradually enlarged to encompass the entire library of 190 shorts. In 1959, KTTV in Los Angeles purchased the Three Stooges films for air, but by the early 1970s, rival station KTLA began airing the Stooges films, keeping them in the schedule until early 1994. The Family Channel ran the shorts as part of their &quot;Stooge TV&quot; block from February 19, 1996, to January 2, 1998. In the late 1990s, AMC had held the rights to the Three Stooges shorts, originally airing them under a programming block called &quot;Stooges Playhouse&quot;. In 1999, it was replaced with a program called &quot;N.Y.UK (New Yuk University of Knuckleheads)&quot;, which starred actor/comedian Leslie Nielsen. The program would show three random Stooge shorts. Nielsen hosts the program as a college instructor, known as the Professor of Stoogelogy, who teaches to the students lectures on the Three Stooges before the Stooges&#x27; shorts air. The block aired several shorts often grouped by a theme, such as similar schtick used in different films. Although the block was discontinued after AMC revamped their format in 2002, the network still ran Stooges shorts occasionally. The AMC run ended when Spike TV (now Paramount Network) picked them up in 2004, airing them in their &quot;Stooges Slap-Happy Hour&quot; every Saturday and Sunday mornings. On June 6, 2005, the network began running the &quot;Stooges Slap-Happy&quot; as a one-hour summer comedy block, which ended on September 2, 2005. By 2007, the network had discontinued the block. Although Spike did air Stooges shorts for a brief time after the block was canceled, as of late April 2008, the Stooges had disappeared from the network&#x27;s schedule entirely. The Three Stooges returned on December 31, 2009, on AMC, starting with the &quot;Countdown with the Stooges&quot; New Year&#x27;s Eve marathon. AMC planned to put several episodes on their website in 2010. As of 2009 AMC still airs The Three Stooges every weekday midnights and mornings. Also as of 2022 AMC&#x27;s other sister channel BBC America also airs The Three Stooges on midnights each weekday. The &quot;Stooges&quot; shorts were best known in Chicago as a part of a half-hour, late-afternoon show on WGN-TV hosted by Bob Bell as &quot;Andy Starr&quot; in the 1960s. In the 1990s, Stooges films were aired as part of The Koz Zone movie segment on Chicago television.

Since the 2000s, Columbia and its television division&#x27;s successor, Sony Pictures Television, has preferred to license the Stooges shorts to cable networks, which left the films off local broadcast TV for several years until they were licensed to nationally broadcast classic TV networks. The last time the Stooges were offered in traditional broadcast syndication was in 1999, when Columbia TriStar Television Distribution put together a new package of 130 half-hour episodes compiling the shorts into themed installments, with new interstitial material created by Evolution Media and voiced by Jeff Bennett (in a similar fashion to the Screen Gems Network, a syndicated block of classic television series also offered around the same time by CTTD with Evolution&#x27;s involvement).

Two stations in Chicago and Boston, however, signed long-term syndication contracts with Columbia years ago and had declined to terminate them. WMEU-CD in Chicago aired all 190 Three Stooges shorts on Saturday afternoons and Sunday evenings until 2014. WSBK-TV in Boston aired Stooges shorts and feature films, including an annual New Year&#x27;s Eve marathon until their contract expired in September 2022; WSBK wanted to renew the contract, but Sony was unwilling to do so. KTLA in Los Angeles dropped the shorts in 1994, but brought them back in 2007 as part of a special retro-marathon commemorating the station&#x27;s 60th anniversary. Since that time, the station&#x27;s original 16 mm Stooges film prints have aired occasionally as part of minimarathons on holidays. Antenna TV, a network broadcasting on the digital subchannels of local broadcast stations (owned by Tribune Broadcasting, which also owns KTLA), began airing the Stooges shorts upon the network&#x27;s January 1, 2011, launch, which ran in multi-hour blocks on weekends through December 29, 2012; most of the Three Stooges feature films are also broadcast on the network, through Antenna TV&#x27;s distribution agreement with Sony Pictures Entertainment (whose Columbia Pictures subsidiary released most of the films). While the network stopped airing Stooges shorts regularly from 2013 to 2015, they were occasionally shown as filler if a movie ran short, as well as in holiday marathons. The shorts returned to Antenna TV&#x27;s regular lineup on January 10, 2015. In 2019, the Three Stooges were picked up by MeTV as part of their lineup.

Columbia&#x27;s library of 190 Stooge shorts has been modified for television distribution. Sony no longer offers the shorts on motion-picture film, and now includes only 100 titles in the television package. All 190 shorts, however, have been released to home video.

Some films have been colorized by two separate companies. The first colorized DVD releases, distributed by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, were prepared by West Wing Studios in 2004, using actual costumes and props for reference. The following year, Legend Films colorized the public-domain shorts &quot;Malice in the Palace&quot;, &quot;Sing a Song of Six Pants&quot;, &quot;Disorder in the Court&quot;, and &quot;Brideless Groom&quot;. &quot;Disorder in the Court&quot; and &quot;Brideless Groom&quot; also appear on two of West Wing&#x27;s colorized releases. In any event, the Columbia-produced shorts (aside from the public domain films) are handled by Sony Pictures Entertainment, while the MGM Stooges shorts are owned by Warner Bros. via their Turner Entertainment division. Sony previously offered 21 of the shorts on their streaming platform Crackle, along with 11 minisodes. Meanwhile, the rights to the Stooges&#x27; feature films rest with the studios that originally produced them (Columbia/Sony for the Columbia films, and The Walt Disney Company for the Fox Film/20th Century Fox films). In January 2024, C3 Entertainment announced that it licensed all 190 Columbia shorts from Sony Pictures Television to establish a new streaming channel, the Three Stooges+ Channel, which would also offer other Three Stooges content.

AMC at one time would air what became known as mini-episodes: five-minute chunks from the Columbia shorts, broadcast with their original theatrical titles.

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==Home media==
Between 1980 and 1985, Columbia Pictures Home Entertainment and RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video released 13 Three Stooges volumes in various formats. The original 13 volume titles were later reissued on VHS by its successor, Columbia TriStar Home Video, between 1993 and 1996, with a DVD reissue between 2000 and 2004.

=== &quot;The Three Stooges Collection&quot; ===
On October 30, 2007, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released a two-disc DVD set titled &quot;The Three Stooges Collection, Volume One: 1934–1936&quot;. The set contains shorts from the first three years the Stooges worked at Columbia Pictures, marking the first time that all 19 shorts were released in their original theatrical order to DVD. Additionally, every short was remastered in high definition, a first for the Stooge films. Previous DVD releases were based on themes (wartime, history, work, etc.), and sold poorly.

The chronological series proved successful, and Sony wasted little time preparing the next set for release. &quot;Volume Two: 1937–1939&quot; was released on May 27, 2008, followed by &quot;Volume Three: 1940–1942&quot; three months later on August 26, 2008. Demand exceeded supply, proving to Sony that they had a hit on their hands. In response, &quot;Volume Four: 1943–1945&quot; was released on October 7, 2008, a mere two months after its predecessor. Volume Four, and &quot;Volume Five: 1946–1948&quot; was belatedly released on March 17, 2009 after delays during the Great Recession. &quot;Volume Five&quot; is the first in the series to feature Shemp Howard with the Stooges and the final volume to feature Curly Howard. &quot;Volume Six: 1949–1951&quot; was released June 16, 2009, and &quot;Volume Seven: 1952–1954&quot; was released on November 10, 2009. &quot;Volume Seven&quot; included 3-D glasses for the two shorts: &quot;Spooks!&quot; and &quot;Pardon My Backfire&quot;. As of 2013, the three-dimensional versions of the two shorts in this volume have been removed. &quot;Volume Eight: 1955–1959&quot; was released on June 1, 2010. This was the final volume of the Stooges collection, bringing the series to a close. &quot;Volume Eight&quot; comprised three discs, and was the only volume to feature Joe Besser and the final volume to feature Shemp Howard. With the release of the eighth volume, for the first time in history, all 190 Three Stooges short subjects had become available to the public, uncut and unedited.

Two years later, on June 5, 2012, these discs were reissued in a DVD boxed set entitled &quot;The Three Stooges: The Ultimate Collection&quot; - now with a ninth volume (three discs) entitled &quot;Rare Treasures from the Columbia Picture Vault&quot;. This volume is not available separately, and comprises two feature films and three cartoons featuring all three Stooges, and also some of their solo work (14 shorts featuring Shemp Howard, 10 shorts featuring Joe Besser, and four shorts featuring Joe DeRita). The 2012 Ultimate Collection consists of all 8 individual original boxsets as they sold before, plus the 3 bonus discs, housed in a thin cardboard box with embossed artwork. On October 18, 2016, The Three Stooges: The Complete DVD Collection was released. It had all the DVDs from volumes 1 through 8 but it did not include the &quot;Rare Treasures from the Columbia Picture Vault&quot; discs. The packaging is much smaller as all 17 of the original discs are stacked on a spindle. All eight volumes are also available on iTunes. On June 15, 2020, iTunes released The Three Stooges: The Complete Series, which features all 190 shorts in an entire collection.

On July 23, 2024, 100 of the shorts were released on Blu-ray for the 100th anniversary (this boxset omits 90 shorts which are still only available on DVD at present time).

== Music ==

* Several instrumental tunes were played over the opening credits of the short features. The most commonly used were:
** The verse portion of the Civil War-era song &quot;Listen to the Mockingbird&quot;, played in a comical way, complete with sounds of birds and such. It was first used in &quot;Pardon My Scotch&quot;, their ninth short film, in 1935. (Prior to this, the opening theme varied and was typically connected to the storyline in some way.)
** &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot;, beginning in 1939, was a slow but straightforward presentation (dubbed the &quot;sliding strings&quot; version), often breaking into a &quot;jazzy&quot; style before ending. In mid-1942, a faster version was used, featuring accordion.
* The Columbia short &quot;Woman Haters&quot; was done completely in rhyme, mostly recited (not sung), in rhythm with a Jazz-age underscore running throughout the film, but with some key lines sung. It was sixth in a &quot;Musical Novelties&quot; short-subject series, and appropriated its musical score from the first five films. The memorable &quot;My Life, My Love, My All&quot;, was originally &quot;At Last!&quot; from the film &quot;Um-Pa&quot;.
* &quot;Swinging the Alphabet&quot; from &quot;Violent Is the Word for Curly&quot; is perhaps the best-known song performed by the Stooges on film.
* The Stooges broke into a three-part harmonized version of &quot;Tears&quot; (&quot;You&#x27;ll Never Know Just What Tears Are&quot;) in &quot;Horses&#x27; Collars&quot;, &quot;A Ducking They Did Go&quot; (where the melody was sung by Bud Jamison), and &quot;Half Shot Shooters&quot;. The song, written by Moe, Larry, Shemp, and one-time Ted Healy Stooge Fred Sanborn, first appeared in the 1930 feature film &quot;Soup to Nuts&quot;.
* The &quot;Lucia Sextet&quot; (&quot;Chi mi frena in tal momento?&quot;), from the opera &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; by Gaetano Donizetti (announced by Larry as &quot;the Sextet from Lucy&quot;) is played on a record player and lip-synched by the Stooges in &quot;Micro-Phonies&quot;. The same melody reappears in &quot;Squareheads of the Round Table&quot; as the tune of &quot;Oh, Elaine, Can You Come Out Tonight?&quot;. &quot;Micro-Phonies&quot; also includes the Johann Strauss II waltz &quot;Voices of Spring&quot; (&quot;Frühlingsstimmen&quot;) Op. 410. Another Strauss waltz, &quot;The Blue Danube&quot;, is featured in &quot;Ants in the Pantry&quot; and &quot;Punch Drunks&quot;.
* The original song &quot;Frederick March&quot; (named for actor Fredric March, but misspelled) was composed by staff musicians at the insistence of studio chief Harry Cohn. Weary of paying royalties for existing marches, Cohn wanted an original march that Columbia could own outright. &quot;Frederick March&quot; became a favorite of director Jules White; it appears in at least seven different Columbia shorts:
** &quot;Termites of 1938&quot; – The Stooges &quot;play&quot; this song on a violin, flute, and string bass at a dinner party in an attempt to attract mice.
** &quot;Dutiful But Dumb&quot; – Curly is hidden inside a floor-standing radio, and plays the song on a modified harmonica.
** &quot;Three Little Twirps&quot; – Heard as background music at the circus while Moe and Curly sell tickets.
** &quot;Idle Roomers&quot; – Curly plays the song on a trombone to calm a wolf man—who goes berserk when he hears music.
** &quot;Gents Without Cents&quot; – Three girls perform acrobatics on stage while this song is playing.
** &quot;Gents in a Jam&quot; – Shemp and Moe have a problem with a radio that will not stop playing this song.
** &quot;Pardon My Backfire&quot; – The song plays on a car radio.
* The Moe/Larry/Curly Joe lineup of the Stooges recorded several musical record albums in the early 1960s. Most of their songs were adaptations of nursery rhymes. Among their more popular recordings were &quot;Making a Record&quot; (a surreal trip to a recording studio built around the song &quot;Go Tell Aunt Mary&quot;), &quot;Three Little Fishes&quot;, &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth&quot;, &quot;Wreck the Halls with Boughs of Holly&quot;, &quot;Mairzy Doats&quot; and &quot;I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas&quot;.
* In 1983, a group called the Jump &#x27;n the Saddle Band recorded a track called &quot;The Curly Shuffle&quot;, which featured the narrator singing about his love of the Stooges mixed with a chorus of many of Curly&#x27;s catchphrases and sound effects. In the mid-1980s, the song became a popular mid-game hit for New York Mets fans in the Shea Stadium bleachers, who danced in small groups when the song was played between innings. The music video, which featured clips of the classic Stooges shorts, was also included as a bonus feature on one of the RCA/Columbia VHS releases.

Three feature-length Columbia releases were actually packages of older Columbia shorts. &quot;Columbia Laff Hour&quot; (introduced in 1956) was a random assortment that included the Stooges among other Columbia comedians like Andy Clyde, Hugh Herbert, and Vera Vague; the content and length varied from one theater to the next. &quot;Three Stooges Fun-o-Rama&quot; (introduced in 1959) was an all-Stooges show capitalizing on their TV fame, again with shorts chosen at random for individual theaters. &quot;The Three Stooges Follies&quot; (1974) was similar to &quot;Laff Hour&quot;, with a trio of Stooge comedies augmented by Buster Keaton and Vera Vague shorts, a Batman serial chapter, and a Kate Smith musical.

== Museum ==
Gary Lassin, grandnephew-in-law of Larry Fine, opened the Stoogeum in 2004 in Spring House, Pennsylvania, north of Philadelphia. It features three floors of exhibits and an 85-seat theater. Peter Seely, editor of the book &quot;Stoogeology: Essays on the Three Stooges,&quot; said that the Stoogeum has &quot;more stuff than I even imagined existed.&quot; Some 2,500 people visit it yearly, many during the annual Three Stooges Fan Club gathering in April.

=== Comic books ===

Over the years, several Three Stooges comics were produced.
* St. John Publications published the first Three Stooges comics in 1949 with two issues, then again in 1953–54 with seven issues.
* Dell Comics published a Three Stooges series first as one-shots in their &quot;Four Color Comics&quot; line for five issues, then gave them a numbered series for four more issues (#6–9). With #10, the title would be published by Gold Key Comics. Under Gold Key, the series lasted through issue #55 in 1972.
* Gold Key Comics then published a series called &quot;The Little Stooges&quot; (seven issues, 1972–74) with story and art by Norman Maurer, Moe&#x27;s son-in-law. This series featured the adventures of three fictional sons of the Three Stooges, as sort of modern-day teen-age versions of the characters.
* Eclipse Comics published the &quot;Three-D Three Stooges&quot; series (three issues, 1986–1987), which reprinted stories from the St. John Publications series.
* Malibu Comics did two one-shot comics, reprinting stories from the Gold Key Comics in 1989 and 1991.
* Eternity Comics published a one-shot comic book called &quot;The Three Stooges in 3-D&quot; in 1991, reprinting four stories from the Gold Key series.
* Bluewater Comics issued a biographical comic in 2011, which followed the lives and careers of the group.
* American Mythology Production publishes comics in 2017 which shows the Three Stooges in the modern times. In 2021, American Mythology announced it was launching two new books: &quot;The Three Stooges Thru The Ages&quot; and &quot;The Robonic Stooges&quot;. Both new series are written by S.A. Check and Jordan Gershowitz.

=== Phonograph records ===
Beginning in 1959, the Three Stooges began appearing in a series of novelty records. Their first recording was a 45 rpm single of the title song from &quot;Have Rocket, Will Travel.&quot; The trio released additional singles and LPs on the Golden, Peter Pan, and Coral labels, mixing comedy adventure albums and off-beat renditions of children&#x27;s songs and stories. Their final recording was the 1966 &quot;Yogi Bear and the Three Stooges Meet the Mad, Mad, Mad Dr. No-No&quot;, which incorporated the Three Stooges into the cast of the Yogi Bear cartoons.

=== Radio ===
Sirius XM Radio aired a special about the Stooges hosted by Tom Bergeron on Friday, July 31, 2009, at 2:00 pm on the Sirius Howard 101 channel. Bergeron had conducted the interviews at the age of 16 when he was still in high school in 1971. The television host had the tapes in storage for many years and was convinced on-air during an interview with Howard Stern to bring them in and turn them into a special.

After finding &quot;the lost tapes&quot;, Bergeron brought them into Stern&#x27;s production studio. He stated that the tapes were so old that the tapes with the Larry Fine interviews began to shred as Stern&#x27;s radio engineers ran them on their tape players. They really had only one shot, but the tapes were saved.

&quot;The Lost Stooges Tapes&quot; was hosted by Tom Bergeron, with modern commentary on the almost 40-year-old interviews that he had conducted with Larry Fine and Moe Howard. At the times of these interviews, Moe was still living at home, while Larry had suffered a stroke and was living in a senior citizen&#x27;s home.

==== &quot;The New Three Stooges&quot; (1965–66) ====

In addition to the unsuccessful television series pilots &quot;Jerks of All Trades&quot;, &quot;The Three Stooges Scrapbook&quot;, and the incomplete &quot;Kook&#x27;s Tour&quot;, the Stooges appeared in an animated series, &quot;The New Three Stooges&quot;, which ran from 1965 to 1966. This series featured a mix of 41 live-action segments that were used as wraparounds to 156 animated Stooges shorts. &quot;The New Three Stooges&quot; became the only regularly scheduled television show for the Stooges. Unlike other films shorts that aired on television, like the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;, &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;, and &quot;Popeye&quot;, the film shorts of the Stooges never had a regularly scheduled national television program in which to air. When Columbia/Screen Gems licensed the film library to television, the shorts aired in any fashion the local stations chose (examples: late-night &quot;filler&quot; material between the end of the late movie and the channel&#x27;s sign-off time; in &quot;marathon&quot; sessions running shorts back-to-back for one, one-and-a-half, or two hours; etc.) By the 1970s, some local stations showed a Columbia short and a &quot;New Three Stooges&quot; cartoon in the same broadcast.

==== &quot;The Robonic Stooges&quot; (1977–78) ====

Another animated series also produced by Hanna-Barbera, titled &quot;The Robonic Stooges&quot;, originally seen as a featured segment on &quot;The Skatebirds&quot; (CBS, 1977–1978), featuring Moe, Larry, and Curly (voiced by Paul Winchell, Joe Baker, and Frank Welker, respectively) as bionic cartoon superheroes with extendable limbs, similar to the later &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot;. &quot;The Robonic Stooges&quot; later aired as a separate half-hour series, retitled &quot;The Three Robonic Stooges&quot; (each half-hour featured two segments of &quot;The Three Robonic Stooges&quot; and one segment of &quot;Woofer &amp; Whimper, Dog Detectives&quot;, the latter re-edited from episodes of &quot;Clue Club&quot;, an earlier Hanna-Barbera cartoon series).

==== &quot;The Three Stooges&quot; (TBA) ====
On June 9, 2015, C3 Entertainment announced it is partnering with London-based production company Cake Entertainment and animation house Titmouse, Inc. to produce a new animated Three Stooges series, consisting of 52 11-minute episodes. Christy Karacas (co-creator of &quot;Superjail!&quot;) directed the pilot episode, with Earl and Robert Benjamin, Chris Prynoski, Tom van Waveren, and Edward Galton executive producing. The series was to be launched to potential buyers at the market of the Annecy International Animated Film Festival.

==== Other appearances ====
In the October 13, 1967, &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Mother Goose?&quot; episode of ABC&#x27;s &quot;World-of-Disney&quot;-like anthology series &quot;Off to See the Wizard&quot;, the Three Stooges made a short appearance as &quot;the three men in a tub&quot;.

Two episodes of Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot; aired on CBS featuring animated Stooges as guest stars - the premiere, &quot;Ghastly Ghost Town&quot; (September 9, 1972) and &quot;The Ghost of the Red Baron&quot; (November 18, 1972).

In a 1980 episode of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, Charles Winchester shows disrespect for three Korean doctors by calling them &quot;Moe, Larry, and Curly&quot;, and says that they are &quot;highly respected individuals in the States&quot;. After Winchester throws out his back and is unable to relieve the pain through conventional methods (in real life, Winchester would have received an automatic medical discharge from the United States Army), Colonel Potter has the Korean doctors try acupuncture (much to Winchester&#x27;s dismay), which cures Winchester. After the treatment, one of the doctors tells Winchester &quot;Not bad for Three Stooges, huh?&quot;, having caught on to his mistreatment of them.

In the episode &quot;Beware the Creeper&quot; of &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot;, the Joker retreats to his hideout after a quick fight with Batman. He yells out for his three henchmen &quot;Moe? Larr? Cur?&quot;, only to find that they are not there. Shortly after that, Batman comes across these three goons in a pool hall; they have distinctive accents and hairstyles similar to those of Moe, Larry, and Curly. These henchmen are briefly seen throughout the rest of the season.

==== Television film (2000) ====
In 2000, long-time Stooge fan Mel Gibson executive-produced a TV film (&quot;The Three Stooges&quot;) about the lives and careers of the comedians. Playing Moe was Paul Ben-Victor, Evan Handler was Larry, John Kassir was Shemp, and Michael Chiklis was Curly. It was filmed in Australia and was produced for and broadcast on ABC. It was based on Michael Fleming&#x27;s authorized biography of the Stooges, &quot;The Three Stooges: From Amalgamated Morons to American Icons&quot;. Its unflattering portrayal of Ted Healy led Healy&#x27;s son to give media interviews calling the film inaccurate. Additional errors of fact included the portrayal that Moe Howard was down on his luck after Columbia canceled their contract and worked as a gofer at the studio, where his brothers, Larry, and he had formerly worked as actors. In reality, Moe was the most careful with his money, which he invested well. His wife Helen and he owned a comfortable house in Toluca Lake, in which they raised their children.

=== Film ===

==== &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963) ====

The Three Stooges (in their Curly Joe period) made a brief cameo appearance as airport firemen in the 1963 film &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot;. An epic comedy with an all-star cast, this film contains many cameo appearances by famous comedians.

==== &quot;The Three Stooges&quot; (2012) ====
A film featuring the Three Stooges, titled &quot;The Three Stooges&quot;, started production on March 14, 2011, with 20th Century Fox and was directed by the Farrelly brothers. The film had been in what one critic has dubbed &quot;development hell&quot;. The Farrellys, who wanted to make the film since 1996, said that they were not going to do a biopic or remake, but instead new Three Stooges episodes set in the present day. The film is broken up into three continuous episodes that revolves around the Stooges characters.

Casting the title characters proved difficult for the studio. Originally slated were Sean Penn to play Larry, Benicio del Toro to play Moe, and Jim Carrey to play Curly. Both Penn and del Toro left the project, but returned while no official confirmation had been made about Jim Carrey. When del Toro was interviewed on MTV News for &quot;The Wolfman&quot;, he spoke about playing Moe. He was later asked who was going to play Larry and Curly in the film and commented that he still thought that Sean Penn and Jim Carrey were going to play them, though he added, &quot;Nothing is for sure yet.&quot;
A story in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; stated that Will Sasso would play Curly in the upcoming comedy and that Hank Azaria was the frontrunner to play Moe. Sasso was ultimately cast as Curly; Sean Hayes of &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; was cast as Larry Fine, while Chris Diamantopoulos was cast as Moe. Jane Lynch later joined the cast, playing a nun. The film was released on April 13, 2012, and grossed over $54 million worldwide. The film received mixed reviews, but Diamantopoulos, Hayes, and Sasso were praised for their performances as Moe, Larry, and Curly.

==== Sequel ====
On May 7, 2015, a sequel was announced, with Sean Hayes, Chris Diamantopoulos, and Will Sasso all reprising their roles. Cameron Fay has been hired to write the script. Production was scheduled to begin in 2018.

==== &quot;The Three Little Stooges&quot; (TBA) ====
On February 3, 2016, C3 announced a new action/adventure film titled &quot;The Three Little Stooges&quot;. It was to star Gordy De StJeor, Liam Dow, and Luke Clark as 12-year-old versions of Moe, Larry, and Curly. The first film, which set the foundation for future films and television spin-offs, was set to begin production in November 2017, and was expected to be released in 2018. The screenplay was written by Harris Goldberg, with Sean McNamara set to direct. The film&#x27;s budget is $5.8 million. On July 19, 2017, C3 began seeking crowdfunding to pay for a portion of the budget. In August 2017, they exceeded their minimum goal of $50,000.

=== Video games ===
In 1984, Gottlieb released an arcade game featuring the Stooges trying to find three kidnapped brides.

Later in 1987, game developer Cinemaware released a successful Three Stooges computer game, available for Apple IIGS, Amiga, Commodore 64, MS-DOS, and Nintendo Entertainment System. Based on the Stooges earning money by doing odd jobs to prevent the foreclosure of an orphanage, it incorporated audio from the original films and was popular enough to be reissued for the Game Boy Advance in 2002, and for PlayStation in 2004.

The Three Stooges also have a slot-game adaptation created by Realtime Gaming.

=== VCR game ===
A VCR game was released by Pressman Toy Corporation in 1986, which used a number of classic Stooges clips.

== In foreign languages ==
In most other languages, the Three Stooges are known by some corresponding variant of their English name. In Chinese, however, the trio is known idiomatically as &quot;Sānge Chòu Píjiàng&quot; (三個臭皮匠) or &quot;Huóbǎo Sānrénzǔ&quot; (活寶三人組). &quot;Sānge Chòu Píjiàng&quot;, literally &quot;Three Smelly Shoemakers&quot;, which derives from a saying in the &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;: &quot;Sāngè chòu píjiàng shèngguò yīgè Zhūgě Liàng&quot; (三個臭皮匠，勝過一個諸葛亮) or &quot;Three smelly shoemakers (are enough to) overcome one Zhuge Liang [a hero of the story]&quot;, i.e. three inferior people can overpower a superior person when they combine their strength. &quot;Huóbǎo Sānrénzǔ&quot; translates as &quot;Trio of Buffoons&quot;. Likewise in Japanese they are known as &quot;San Baka Taishō&quot; (三ばか大将) meaning &quot;Three Idiot Generals&quot; or &quot;Three &quot;Baka&quot; Generals&quot;.

In Spanish, they are known as &quot;Los tres chiflados&quot; or, roughly, &quot;The Three Crackpots&quot;. In French and German usage, the name of the trio is partially translated as &quot;Les Trois Stooges&quot; (though the French version of the movie adaptation used a fully translated name, &quot;Les Trois Corniauds&quot;) and &quot;Die drei Stooges&quot; respectively. In Italy they are known as &quot;I tre marmittoni&quot;. In Thai, the trio is known as &quot;3 สมุนจอมป่วน&quot; (, ) or &quot;3 พี่น้องจอมยุ่ง&quot; (, ). In Portuguese, they are known as &quot;Os Três Patetas&quot; in Brazil, and &quot;Os Três Estarolas&quot; in Portugal, &quot;estarola&quot; being a direct translation of &quot;stooge&quot;, while &quot;pateta&quot; being more related to &quot;goofy&quot;. In Persian the trio are dubbed as &quot;سه نخاله&quot;. In Turkish, they are dubbed as &quot;Üç Ahbap Çavuş&quot; (&quot;The Three Cronies&quot;).

== Awards and nominations ==
In 1993, the Three Stooges won the MTV Lifetime Achievement Award.

They received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1560 Vine Street on August 30, 1983.

Casta became a &quot;GUESS? Girl&quot; in 1993 and gained further recognition as a Victoria&#x27;s Secret Angel from 1998 to 2000 and as a spokesperson for cosmetics company L&#x27;Oréal. She has appeared on over 250 covers of such popular magazines as &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot; and &quot;Glamour&quot;, and has walked runways for designers such as Yves Saint Laurent, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Chanel, Dior, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Paco Rabanne, Kenzo, Louis Vuitton, Christian Lacroix, Roberto Cavalli, Jacquemus, Ralph Lauren and Vivienne Westwood.

As an actress, Casta appeared in such films as &quot;Asterix and Obelix vs. Caesar&quot; (1999), &quot;Born in 68&quot; (2008), &quot;Face&quot; (2009), &quot;&quot; (2010), which earned her a nomination for the César Award for Best Supporting Actress, &quot;Arbitrage&quot; (2012), &quot;A Faithful Man&quot; (2018) and &quot;The Crusade&quot; (2021).

==Early life==
Laetitia Casta was born in Pont-Audemer, Normandy. Her mother, Line Blin, is from Normandy. Her father, Dominique Casta, is from Corsica. Casta has an older brother, Jean-Baptiste, and a younger sister, Marie-Ange. She spent her childhood in Normandy and Corsica.

Laetitia has one quarter Italian ancestry from her father.

== Career ==
=== Modeling ===
Casta&#x27;s modeling career reportedly began when she was discovered by the photographer Frédéric Cresseaux, during a family holiday in her father&#x27;s native Corsica, at age 15. After her brother Jean-Baptiste entered her without her prior knowledge, Casta was elected Miss Lumio &#x27;93.

Casta has been the L&#x27;Oréal Paris brand ambassador since 1998. She has been featured in Pantene, Guess?, Tommy Hilfiger, Valentino, Givenchy, Ralph Lauren, Cacharel, Lolita Lempicka, Chanel, Dolce and Gabbana, Nina Ricci, Swarovski, Yves Saint Laurent, Louis Vuitton, Roberto Cavalli, Jacquemus, J.

Casta was the last muse of fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent, serving as the bride in his fashion shows from 1998 to 2001. She walked down the annual Victoria&#x27;s Secret Fashion Show in 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000. She was one of the company&#x27;s signature Victoria&#x27; Secret Angels from 1998 to 2000. She claims that her career with Victoria&#x27;s Secret ended because she was &quot;too much of [a] rebel&quot;. She also appeared in &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot; three consecutive times, as well at the Pirelli Calendar 1999 by Herb Ritts, 2000 by Annie Leibovitz and 2019 by Albert Watson.

The Parisians could follow her Adventures in the Galeries Lafayette by Jean-Paul Goude. For Christmas 2011, Peter Lindbergh shot &quot;True Love&quot;, the very thought of Casta at the summit of Manhattan and between the snowy lions of marble of the New York Public Library for Tiffany &amp; Co.

=== Acting ===
Her first role was as Falbala in &quot;Asterix &amp; Obelix Take On Caesar&quot; directed by Claude Zidi, a live-action adaptation of the comic book &quot;Asterix&quot;, in which Obelix, portrayed by Gérard Depardieu, plays Casta&#x27;s love interest. Casta appeared in &quot;Les Ames Fortes&quot;, directed by Raul Ruiz. Her performance as Brigitte Bardot in the movie &quot;Gainsbourg (Vie heroique)&quot; earned her a Cesar Award nomination. Casta served as a jury member at the 69th Venice International Film Festival in 2012.

=== Marianne controversy ===
In 1999, Casta was ranked first in a national survey ordered by the French Mayors&#x27; Association to decide who should be the new model for the bust of &quot;Marianne&quot;, an allegorical symbol of the French Republic, which stands inside every French town hall. Casta became the focus of a controversy when, after being selected to be Marianne, newspapers in Britain and France reported that she had relocated to London where taxes on high earners are lower. Casta&#x27;s father said she went to London for professional reasons; on a TV show, she also said that she rented a flat in London to be near her boyfriend. The French minister of the interior spoke about Casta on the radio; comparing the advantages of living in France with regard to the drawbacks of London after political opponents used Casta&#x27;s relocation to London as an opportunity to criticise the government.

==Political involvement==
On 6 April 2008, Casta demonstrated in a White March of nonviolent protest to ask for the immediate release of Ingrid Betancourt, presidential candidate kidnapped since 2002 by the FARC.
On 30 April 2002, she attended the demonstration &quot;Vive la République&quot; after the first round election of the 2002 presidential election.

She was appointed as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador on 9 December 2016.

<text>Sutter&#x27;s Mill was a water-powered sawmill on the bank of the South Fork American River in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada in California. It was named after its owner John Sutter. A worker constructing the mill, James W. Marshall, found gold there in 1848. This discovery set off the California gold rush (1848–1855), a major event in the history of the United States.

The mill was later reconstructed in the original design and today forms part of Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park in Coloma, California. A meteorite fall in 2012 landed close to the mill; the recovered fragments were named the Sutter&#x27;s Mill meteorite.

==History==

The territory of Alta California, which includes modern-day California, was settled by the Viceroyalty of New Spain from 1683 onwards. It became part of an independent Mexico in 1821. John Sutter, a German-Swiss settler, arrived in the region in 1839. He established a colony at New Helvetia (now part of Sacramento), in the Central Valley. The United States conquered the region during the Mexican–American War (1846–1848): California was overrun by US forces in 1846 and a ceasefire in the region was agreed in January 1847. A peace treaty for the wider war had not yet been completed when Sutter decided to begin construction of a sawmill in the forest about 30 miles northeast of his existing colony. Sutter employed James Wilson Marshall, a carpenter originally from New Jersey, to supervise construction of the new building.

On January 24, 1848, while working on construction of the mill, Marshall found flakes of gold in the South Fork American River. On February 2, 1848, before news of the discovery had arrived, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed in Mexico City. This peace treaty formally transferred sovereignty over the region to the United States. Two workers at the mill, Henry Bigler and Azariah Smith, were veterans of the Mormon Battalion and recorded their experience in journals. Bigler recorded the date when gold was discovered, January 24, 1848, in his diary. Sutter&#x27;s claim to the US government for mineral rights was investigated by Joseph Libbey Folsom, who issued confirmation of the gold discovery in June. The first flake found by Marshall was shipped to President James K. Polk in Washington D.C., arriving in August 1848. It is now on display in the National Museum of American History, part of the Smithsonian Institution.

As news of the gold spread, settlers flocked to the new US territory of California. The population expanded from 14,000 non-natives in 1848 to 224,000 in 1852. There were over 80,000 newcomers in 1849 and another 91,000 in 1850. Many settled at the new town of Coloma, California, which sprung up close to Sutter&#x27;s Mill. Numerous further discoveries of gold in California were made. During the next seven years, approximately 300,000 people came to California (half by land and half by sea) to seek their fortunes from either mining for gold or selling supplies to the prospectors. This California Gold Rush permanently changed the territory, both through mass immigration and the economic effects of the gold. California became a US state in 1850.

==Current status==
The site of the mill is part of the Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park, registered as California Historical Landmark number 530.

On September 8, 1965, a groundbreaking was held to begin the construction of a replica of the original structure, based on Marshall&#x27;s own drawings and a photograph of the mill taken circa 1850. The replica was nearly completed by the following year, and while not built at the exact spot as the original, it was designed to be moved there if the river returned to its 1848 stream bed. The newly completed replica was officially dedicated on January 21, 1968. In 2014, the 1960s structure was replaced with a new replica, built closer to the original site.

==Meteorite==
On April 22, 2012 a meteor entered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and exploded, showering meteorite fragments over parts of California and Nevada. The first samples of this meteorite fall were recovered close to Sutter&#x27;s Mill, so it was named the Sutter&#x27;s Mill meteorite. Several dozen fragments were eventually identified, with a total weight of about a kilogram. The meteorite is classified as a carbonaceous chondrite and contains some of the oldest known material in the Solar System.

==In popular culture==
The mill was the namesake and inspiration for a song by singer-songwriter Dan Fogelberg. The mill was also the namesake for a song by the New Riders of the Purple Sage, and for Herb Sutter&#x27;s blog. In Beverly Cleary&#x27;s novel &quot;Mitch and Amy&quot;, the protagonists build a model of Sutter&#x27;s Mill out of toothpicks. The mill is referenced heavily in an episode of the television series &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; titled &quot;At the End of the Rainbow,&quot; in which Laura Ingalls Wilder and a friend believe they have found gold in a stream near Walnut Grove.

<text>Sutter&#x27;s Fort was a 19th-century agricultural and trade colony in the Mexican &quot;Alta California&quot; province. Established in 1839, the site of the fort was originally part of a utopian colonial project called New Helvetia (&quot;New Switzerland&quot;) by its builder John Sutter, though construction of the fort proper would not begin until 1841. The fort was the first non-Indigenous community in the California Central Valley, and saw grave mistreatment of Indigenous laborers in plantation or feudal style conditions. The fort is famous for its association with the Donner Party, the California Gold Rush, and the formation of the city of Sacramento, surrounding the fort. It is notable for its proximity to the end of the California and Siskiyou Trails, which it served as a waystation.

In modern times, the adobe structure has been restored to its original condition () and is now administered by California Department of Parks and Recreation. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961.

==History==
To build his colony, John Sutter secured a 50,000 acre land grant in the Central Valley from the Mexican governor. The main building of the fort is a two-story adobe structure built between 1841 and 1843 using Indigenous forced labor. This building is the only original surviving structure at the reconstructed Sutter&#x27;s Fort State Historic Park. It was in here on January 28, 1848, that James Marshall met privately with John Sutter in order to show him the gold that Marshall had found during the construction of Sutter&#x27;s sawmill along the American River only four days earlier. Sutter built the original fort with walls thick and 15 to high. Pioneers took residence at Sutter&#x27;s Fort around 1841. Following word of the California gold rush, the fort was largely deserted by the 1850s and fell into disrepair. 

===Construction===
The party led by John Sutter landed on the bank of the American River in August 1839. The group included three Europeans and a Native American boy, probably to serve as interpreter. Some of the first people brought to the colony were Native Hawaiian workers, called Kanakas. Sutter had entered a contract with the governor of Hawaii to import and use the labor of these eight men and two women for three years. Once the first camp was set up, Sutter used local Miwok, Nisenan, and &quot;missionized&quot; Native Californians to build the first building, a three-room adobe.

===Agricultural colony===
Once the fort was built, Sutter established an agricultural colony with labor structures similar to Southern plantations and European feudalism. The colony relied on ranching and growing wheat crops. European colonists oversaw Native Californian and Native Hawaiian workers, who were often gravely mistreated. Sutter employed a caste system to ensure that the minority European settlers maintained control over the colony. Although some of the laborers worked voluntarily, many were subjected to brutal conditions that resembled enslavement or serfdom. 

===Decline===
After gold was discovered at Sutter&#x27;s Mill (also owned by John Sutter) in Coloma on January 24, 1848, the fort was abandoned.

===Preservation===
In 1891, the Native Sons of the Golden West, who sought to safeguard many of the landmarks of California&#x27;s pioneer days, purchased and rehabilitated Sutter&#x27;s Fort when the City of Sacramento sought to demolish it. Repair efforts were completed in 1893 and the fort was given by the Native Sons of the Golden West to the State of California. In 1947, the fort was transferred to the authority of California State Parks as Sutter&#x27;s Fort State Historic Park.

Most of the original neighborhood structures were initially built in the late 1930s as residences, many of which have been converted to commercial uses such as private medical practices. The history of the neighborhood is largely residential.

==Geography and hydrology==
Sutter&#x27;s Fort is located on level ground at an elevation of approximately above mean sea datum. The slope elevation decreases northward toward the American River and westward toward the Sacramento River. Slope elevation gradually increases to the south and east, away from the rivers. All surface drainage flows toward the Sacramento River. Groundwater in the vicinity flows south-southwest toward the Sacramento Delta. However, after peak rainfall, the Sacramento River swells and the groundwater flow can actually reverse away from the river.

===Sutter&#x27;s Landing===
Sutter&#x27;s Landing is the spot the Captain John A. Sutter landed in August 1839 at the American River after coming up the Sacramento River from Yerba Buena at . After landing, Sutter built a base camp, then Sutter&#x27;s Fort. The site of the landing is California Historical Landmark #591 that was listed on May 22, 1957.

===Coloma Road===
The old Coloma Road opened in 1847, it ran from Sutter&#x27;s Fort to the city of Coloma. Marshall traveled the road to tell of his gold find to Captain John A. Sutter. During the 49ers gold rush thousands of miners traveled the road heading out to look for gold and claims. Coloma Road at Sutter&#x27;s Fort is a California Historical Landmark No. 745. There are two other Coloma Road California Historical Landmarks: Coloma Road, Rescue California Historical Landmark, No. 748, in Coloma and California Historical Landmark No. 747 at Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park. California&#x27;s first stage line, California Stage Company, traveled the road starting in 1849, the line was founded by James E. Birch.

<text>Dekker&#x27;s algorithm is the first known correct solution to the mutual exclusion problem in concurrent programming where processes only communicate via shared memory. The solution is attributed to Dutch mathematician Th. J. Dekker by Edsger W. Dijkstra in an unpublished paper on sequential process descriptions and his manuscript on cooperating sequential processes. It allows two threads to share a single-use resource without conflict, using only shared memory for communication.

It avoids the strict alternation of a naïve turn-taking algorithm, and was one of the first mutual exclusion algorithms to be invented.

== Overview ==

If two processes attempt to enter a critical section at the same time, the algorithm will allow only one process in, based on whose it is. If one process is already in the critical section, the other process will busy wait for the first process to exit. This is done by the use of two flags, and , which indicate an intention to enter the critical section on the part of processes 0 and 1, respectively, and a variable that indicates who has priority between the two processes.

Dekker&#x27;s algorithm can be expressed in pseudocode, as follows.

Processes indicate an intention to enter the critical section which is tested by the outer while loop. If the other process has not flagged intent, the critical section can be entered safely irrespective of the current turn. Mutual exclusion will still be guaranteed as neither process can become critical before setting their flag (implying at least one process will enter the while loop). This also guarantees progress as waiting will not occur on a process which has withdrawn intent to become critical. Alternatively, if the other process&#x27;s variable was set, the while loop is entered and the turn variable will establish who is permitted to become critical. Processes without priority will withdraw their intention to enter the critical section until they are given priority again (the inner while loop). Processes with priority will break from the while loop and enter their critical section.

Dekker&#x27;s algorithm guarantees mutual exclusion, freedom from deadlock, and freedom from starvation. Let us see why the last property holds. Suppose p0 is stuck inside the loop forever. There is freedom from deadlock, so eventually p1 will proceed to its critical section and set (and the value of turn will remain unchanged as long as p0 doesn&#x27;t progress). Eventually p0 will break out of the inner loop (if it was ever stuck on it). After that it will set to true and settle down to waiting for to become false (since , it will never do the actions in the while loop). The next time p1 tries to enter its critical section, it will be forced to execute the actions in its loop. In particular, it will eventually set to false and get stuck in the loop (since turn remains 0). The next time control passes to p0, it will exit the loop and enter its critical section.

If the algorithm were modified by performing the actions in the loop without checking if , then there is a possibility of starvation. Thus all the steps in the algorithm are necessary.

== Notes ==

One advantage of this algorithm is that it doesn&#x27;t require special test-and-set (atomic read/modify/write) instructions and is therefore highly portable between languages and machine architectures. One disadvantage is that it is limited to two processes and makes use of busy waiting instead of process suspension. (The use of busy waiting suggests that processes should spend a minimum amount of time inside the critical section.)

Modern operating systems provide mutual exclusion primitives that are more general and flexible than Dekker&#x27;s algorithm. However, in the absence of actual contention between the two processes, the entry and exit from critical section is extremely efficient when Dekker&#x27;s algorithm is used.

Many modern CPUs execute their instructions in an out-of-order fashion; even memory accesses can be reordered (see memory ordering). This algorithm won&#x27;t work on SMP machines equipped with these CPUs without the use of memory barriers.

Additionally, many optimizing compilers can perform transformations that will cause this algorithm to fail regardless of the platform. In many languages, it is legal for a compiler to detect that the flag variables and are never accessed in the loop. It can then remove the writes to those variables from the loop, using a process called loop-invariant code motion. It would also be possible for many compilers to detect that the &quot;turn&quot; variable is never modified by the inner loop, and perform a similar transformation, resulting in a potential infinite loop. If either of these transformations is performed, the algorithm will fail, regardless of architecture.

To alleviate this problem, volatile variables should be marked as modifiable outside the scope of the currently executing context. For example, in C, C++, C# or Java, one would annotate these variables as &#x27;volatile&#x27;. Note however that the C/C++ &quot;volatile&quot; attribute only guarantees that the compiler generates code with the proper ordering; it does not include the necessary memory barriers to guarantee in-order &quot;execution&quot; of that code. C++11 atomic variables can be used to guarantee the appropriate ordering requirements — by default, operations on atomic variables are sequentially consistent so if the wants_to_enter and turn variables are atomic a naive implementation will &quot;just work&quot;. Alternatively, ordering can be guaranteed by the explicit use of separate fences, with the load and store operations using a relaxed ordering.

<text>In computer science, mutual exclusion is a property of concurrency control, which is instituted for the purpose of preventing race conditions. It is the requirement that one thread of execution never enters a critical section while a concurrent thread of execution is already accessing said critical section, which refers to an interval of time during which a thread of execution accesses a shared resource or shared memory.

The shared resource is a data object, which two or more concurrent threads are trying to modify (where two concurrent read operations are permitted but, no two concurrent write operations or one read and one write are permitted, since it leads to data inconsistency). Mutual exclusion algorithms ensure that if a process is already performing write operation on a data object [critical section] no other process/thread is allowed to access/modify the same object until the first process has finished writing upon the data object [critical section] and released the object for other processes to read and write upon.

The requirement of mutual exclusion was first identified and solved by Edsger W. Dijkstra in his seminal 1965 paper &quot;Solution of a problem in concurrent programming control&quot;, which is credited as the first topic in the study of concurrent algorithms.

A simple example of why mutual exclusion is important in practice can be visualized using a singly linked list of four items, where the second and third are to be removed. The removal of a node that sits between two other nodes is performed by changing the &quot;next&quot; pointer of the previous node to point to the next node (in other words, if node is being removed, then the &quot;next&quot; pointer of node is changed to point to node , thereby removing from the linked list any reference to node ). When such a linked list is being shared between multiple threads of execution, two threads of execution may attempt to remove two different nodes simultaneously, one thread of execution changing the &quot;next&quot; pointer of node to point to node , while another thread of execution changes the &quot;next&quot; pointer of node to point to node . Although both removal operations complete successfully, the desired state of the linked list is not achieved: node remains in the list, because the &quot;next&quot; pointer of node points to node .

This problem (called a &quot;race condition&quot;) can be avoided by using the requirement of mutual exclusion to ensure that simultaneous updates to the same part of the list cannot occur.

The term mutual exclusion is also used in reference to the simultaneous writing of a memory address by one thread while the aforementioned memory address is being manipulated or read by one or more other threads.

==Problem description==

The problem which mutual exclusion addresses is a problem of resource sharing: how can a software system control multiple processes&#x27; access to a shared resource, when each process needs exclusive control of that resource while doing its work? The mutual-exclusion solution to this makes the shared resource available only while the process is in a specific code segment called the critical section. It controls access to the shared resource by controlling each mutual execution of that part of its program where the resource would be used.

A successful solution to this problem must have at least these two properties:
* It must implement &quot;mutual exclusion&quot;: only one process can be in the critical section at a time.
* It must be free of &quot;deadlocks&quot;: if processes are trying to enter the critical section, one of them must eventually be able to do so successfully, provided no process stays in the critical section permanently.

Deadlock freedom can be expanded to implement one or both of these properties:
* &quot;Lockout-freedom&quot; guarantees that any process wishing to enter the critical section will be able to do so eventually. This is distinct from deadlock avoidance, which requires that &quot;some&quot; waiting process be able to get access to the critical section, but does not require that every process gets a turn. If two processes continually trade a resource between them, a third process could be locked out and experience resource starvation, even though the system is not in deadlock. If a system is free of lockouts, it ensures that every process can get a turn at some point in the future.
* A &quot;k-bounded waiting property&quot; gives a more precise commitment than lockout-freedom. Lockout-freedom ensures every process can access the critical section eventually: it gives no guarantee about how long the wait will be. In practice, a process could be overtaken an arbitrary or unbounded number of times by other higher-priority processes before it gets its turn. Under a &quot;k&quot;-bounded waiting property, each process has a finite maximum wait time. This works by setting a limit to the number of times other processes can cut in line, so that no process can enter the critical section more than &quot;k&quot; times while another is waiting.

Every process&#x27;s program can be partitioned into four sections, resulting in four states. Program execution cycles through these four states in order:
;Non-Critical Section: Operation is outside the critical section; the process is not using or requesting the shared resource.

;Trying: The process attempts to enter the critical section.

;Critical Section: The process is allowed to access the shared resource in this section.

;Exit: The process leaves the critical section and makes the shared resource available to other processes.

If a process wishes to enter the critical section, it must first execute the trying section and wait until it acquires access to the critical section. After the process has executed its critical section and is finished with the shared resources, it needs to execute the exit section to release them for other processes&#x27; use. The process then returns to its non-critical section.

==Enforcing mutual exclusion==

===Hardware solutions===
On uni-processor systems, the simplest solution to achieve mutual exclusion is to disable interrupts during a process&#x27;s critical section. This will prevent any interrupt service routines from running (effectively preventing a process from being preempted). Although this solution is effective, it leads to many problems. If a critical section is long, then the system clock will drift every time a critical section is executed because the timer interrupt is no longer serviced, so tracking time is impossible during the critical section. Also, if a process halts during its critical section, control will never be returned to another process, effectively halting the entire system. A more elegant method for achieving mutual exclusion is the busy-wait.

Busy-waiting is effective for both uniprocessor and multiprocessor systems. The use of shared memory and an atomic test-and-set instruction provide the mutual exclusion. A process can test-and-set on a location in shared memory, and since the operation is atomic, only one process can set the flag at a time. Any process that is unsuccessful in setting the flag can either go on to do other tasks and try again later, release the processor to another process and try again later, or continue to loop while checking the flag until it is successful in acquiring it. Preemption is still possible, so this method allows the system to continue to function—even if a process halts while holding the lock.

Several other atomic operations can be used to provide mutual exclusion of data structures; most notable of these is compare-and-swap (CAS). CAS can be used to achieve wait-free mutual exclusion for any shared data structure by creating a linked list where each node represents the desired operation to be performed. CAS is then used to change the pointers in the linked list during the insertion of a new node. Only one process can be successful in its CAS; all other processes attempting to add a node at the same time will have to try again. Each process can then keep a local copy of the data structure, and upon traversing the linked list, can perform each operation from the list on its local copy.

===Software solutions===
In addition to hardware-supported solutions, some software solutions exist that use busy waiting to achieve mutual exclusion. Examples include:
* Dekker&#x27;s algorithm
* Peterson&#x27;s algorithm
* Lamport&#x27;s bakery algorithm
* Szymański&#x27;s algorithm
* Taubenfeld&#x27;s black-white bakery algorithm
* Maekawa&#x27;s algorithm

These algorithms do not work if out-of-order execution is used on the platform that executes them. Programmers have to specify strict ordering on the memory operations within a thread.

It is often preferable to use synchronization facilities provided by an operating system&#x27;s multithreading library, which will take advantage of hardware solutions if possible but will use software solutions if no hardware solutions exist. For example, when the operating system&#x27;s lock library is used and a thread tries to acquire an already acquired lock, the operating system could suspend the thread using a context switch and swap it out with another thread that is ready to be run, or could put that processor into a low power state if there is no other thread that can be run. Therefore, most modern mutual exclusion methods attempt to reduce latency and busy-waits by using queuing and context switches. However, if the time that is spent suspending a thread and then restoring it can be proven to be always more than the time that must be waited for a thread to become ready to run after being blocked in a particular situation, then spinlocks are an acceptable solution (for that situation only).

==Bound on the mutual exclusion problem==

One binary test&amp;set register is sufficient to provide the deadlock-free solution to the mutual exclusion problem. But a solution built with a test&amp;set register can possibly lead to the starvation of some processes which become caught in the trying section. In fact, formula_1 distinct memory states are required to avoid lockout. To avoid unbounded waiting, &quot;n&quot; distinct memory states are required.

==Recoverable mutual exclusion==
Most algorithms for mutual exclusion are designed with the assumption that no failure occurs while a process is running inside the critical section. However, in reality such failures may be commonplace. For example, a sudden loss of power or faulty interconnect might cause a process in a critical section to experience an unrecoverable error or otherwise be unable to continue. If such a failure occurs, conventional, non-failure-tolerant mutual exclusion algorithms may deadlock or otherwise fail key liveness properties. To deal with this problem, several solutions using crash-recovery mechanisms have been proposed.

==Types of mutual exclusion devices==
The solutions explained above can be used to build the synchronization primitives below:
* Locks (mutexes)
* Readers–writer locks
* Recursive locks
* Semaphores
* Monitors
* Message passing
* Tuple space

Many forms of mutual exclusion have side-effects. For example, classic semaphores permit deadlocks, in which one process gets a semaphore, another process gets a second semaphore, and then both wait till the other semaphore to be released. Other common side-effects include starvation, in which a process never gets sufficient resources to run to completion; priority inversion, in which a higher-priority thread waits for a lower-priority thread; and high latency, in which response to interrupts is not prompt.

Much research is aimed at eliminating the above effects, often with the goal of guaranteeing non-blocking progress. No perfect scheme is known. Blocking system calls used to sleep an entire process. Until such calls became threadsafe, there was no proper mechanism for sleeping a single thread within a process (see polling).

<doc id="36832" wikidata="Q842490" url="?curid=36832" title="Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons">
<text>The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is an intergovernmental organisation and the implementing body for the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which entered into force on 29 April 1997. The OPCW, with its 193 member states, has its seat in The Hague, Netherlands; it oversees the global endeavour for the permanent and verifiable elimination of chemical weapons.

The organisation promotes and verifies the adherence to the Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits the use of chemical weapons and requires their destruction. Verification consists both of evaluation of declarations by member states and onsite inspections.

The organisation was awarded the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize &quot;for its extensive efforts to eliminate chemical weapons&quot;. Nobel Committee chairman Thorbjørn Jagland said, &quot;The conventions and the work of the OPCW have defined the use of chemical weapons as a taboo under international law&quot;.

==History==
The Hague was chosen as the location for the seat of the organisation after a successful lobby of the Dutch government, competing against Vienna and Geneva. The organisation has its headquarters next to the World Forum Convention Centre (where it holds its yearly Conference of States Parties) and an equipment store and laboratory facility in Rijswijk. The headquarters were officially opened by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands on 20 May 1998. and consist of an eight-story building built in a semi-circle. A &quot;permanent memorial to all victims&quot; is present at the back of the building and is open to the public.

The OPCW headquarters building was designed by American architect Gerhard Kallmann of Kallmann McKinnell &amp; Wood.

The first Director-General only served about one year of his second term, after which, in April 2002, he was removed from office on grounds of lack of confidence by the member states. It was argued by &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s columnist George Monbiot that Director-General José Bustani was being forced out by the U.S. government, despite the convention insisting the OPCW &quot;shall not seek or receive instructions from any government&quot;; the US had tried to persuade Brazil to recall Bustani. Monbiot wrote that the U.S. had tried other measures, although the convention also indicates that states should &quot;not seek to influence&quot; staff. In line with his mandate, Bustani wanted Iraq to sign the convention thus allowing international chemical weapons monitors into Iraq and thus potentially impeding the U.S. push for war against Iraq. The U.S. gave three main arguments for the removal of Bustani&#x27;s from his position: &quot;polarising and confrontational conduct&quot;, &quot;mismanagement issues&quot; and &quot;advocacy of inappropriate roles for the OPCW&quot;. The removal was subsequently determined to be improper by an Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organization and consequently Bustani was awarded €50,000 in moral damages, his pay for the remainder of his second term, and his legal costs.

On 11 October 2013, the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that the OPCW had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for &quot;extensive work to eliminate chemical weapons&quot;. The committee further indicated how &quot;Recent events in Syria, where chemical weapons have again been put to use, have underlined the need to enhance the efforts to do away with such weapons.&quot; In the year ending September 2014, the OPCW had overseen the destruction of some 97 per cent of Syria&#x27;s declared chemical weapons.

In 2014, The OPCW–The Hague Award was established to honour select individuals and institutions by highlighting their exceptional contributions towards the goal of a world permanently free of chemical weapons. The award was created as a legacy of the OPCW winning the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize. The OPCW—The Hague Award fund was created using the approximately €900,000 monetary prize which accompanied the Nobel Peace Prize, and is also supported financially by the City of The Hague, where the OPCW is based.

In June 2018, the OPCW voted to expand its own powers, allowing itself to assign blame for a contravention of its regulations.

In November 2019, a unanimous agreement of OPCW member states allowed the addition of the Novichok agents to &quot;list of controlled substances&quot; of the CWC &quot;in one of the first major changes to the treaty since it was agreed in the 1990s&quot; in response to the 2018 poisonings in the UK.

==Organisational structure==
The activities of the OPCW and its core organisational structure are described in the Chemical Weapons Convention (whose members are all in OPCW). The principal body is the Conference of the States Parties (CSP), which normally is convened yearly, and in which all countries can participate, with equal voting rights. Countries are generally represented in the conference by a permanent representative to the organisation, which in most cases is also the ambassador to the Netherlands. The conference decides on all main topics regarding the organisation (for example, taking retaliation measures) and the convention (approving guidelines, imposing retaliating measures against members).

The Executive Council (EC) is the executive organ of the organisation and consists of 41 states parties, which are appointed by the conference on a two-year term. The council amongst others oversees the budget and cooperates with the General Secretariat on all matters related to the convention.

The Technical Secretariat (TS) applies most of the activities mandated by the council and is the body where most of the employees of the organisation work. The main activities of the OPCW are performed by the inspection and the verification divisions.

All states parties make contributions to the OPCW budget, based on a modified UN scale of assessments. The OPCW budget for 2020 is €70,958,760
== Powers ==
The OPCW has the power to report on whether chemical weapons were used in an attack it has investigated.

&quot;The OPCW has the power to send inspectors to any signatory country to search for evidence of production of banned chemicals. It also can send experts to help countries to investigate crime scenes where chemical agents may have been used.&quot;

In June 2018 following the Skripal poisoning the UK convinced other members despite the Russian opposition that the OPCW needed to grant itself new powers to assign blame for attacks. The vote was won by a margin of 82 to 24, which exceeded the two-thirds majority needed for the motion to pass.

==Inspections==

===Chemical weapons destruction facilities===
At all operational chemical weapons destruction facilities, 24/7 inspections by the OPCW take place on site to verify the success of the destruction as well as the amounts of weapons being destroyed. In light of the hazardous environment in which the inspections take place, they are generally performed by evaluation via CCTV-systems.

===Industry inspections===
Inspections are designed to verify compliance of States Parties with the requirements imposed on production and use of scheduled chemicals and to verify that industrial activities of member states have been correctly declared according to the obligation set by the CWC. The intensity and frequency of the inspections is dependent on the type of chemical produced (in descending order: Schedule 1, Schedule 2, Schedule 3 or DOC, see Scheduled Chemicals), but is regardless of the standing of the member state.
For Schedule 1 and 2 facilities, a mass balance is prepared to identify whether all produced chemicals can be accounted for and whether the amounts are consistent with the declarations made by member states. Furthermore, at Schedule 2 and 3 facilities clues are investigated whether, contrary to the declaration and to the rules in the convention, Schedule 1 chemicals are produced. At Schedule 3 and DOC, the main aim is to check the declaration and to verify the absence of Schedule 2 and Schedule 1 production units. The time limit Schedule 2 inspections is 96 hours while Schedule 3 and DOC inspections can take a maximum of 24 hours. There is no time limit on Schedule 1 inspections.

===Challenge inspections and investigations of alleged use===
In case of allegation of use of chemical weapons or the prohibited production, a fact-finding inspection can be employed according to the convention. None of those activities have taken place, although the OPCW contributed to investigations of alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria as part of a United Nations mission. The OPCW only undertakes these inspections on request of another member state, after verification of the presented proof. To avoid misuse, a majority of three-quarters can block a challenge inspection request.

==Relations with the United Nations==
While the OPCW is not a specialised agency of the United Nations, it cooperates both on policy and practical issues as a related organisation. On 7 September 2000, the OPCW and the United Nations signed a cooperation agreement outlining how they were to coordinate their activities. The inspectors furthermore travel on the United Nations Laissez-Passer in which a sticker is placed explaining their position, and privileges and immunities. The United Nations Regional Groups also operate at the OPCW to govern the rotations on the Executive Council and provide informal discussion platform.

==Membership==

All 193 parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention are automatically members of the OPCW. Other states which are eligible to become members are UN member states: Israel is a signatory state that has not ratified the Convention; and Egypt, North Korea and South Sudan, which have neither signed nor acceded to the Convention. Palestine was the most recent state to submit its instrument of accession to the Convention. On 21 April 2021, Syria was stripped of its voting rights at the OPCW after Syrian forces were found to have repeatedly used poison gas during the Syrian civil war. A two-thirds majority of members voted to immediately revoke Syria&#x27;s privileges at the agency.

==Leadership==

The Organisation is currently led by Director-General Ambassador Fernando Arias of Spain.

The Director-General is directly appointed by the Conference for a maximum of two four-year terms. A historical list of Directors-General is shown below.

The appointment of Ambassador Arias followed a consensus recommendation by the OPCW Executive Council in October 2017.

Ambassador Arias is a career diplomat with extensive experience in multilateral diplomacy. Previously, he served as Ambassador of Spain to the Netherlands and the Permanent Representative of Spain to the OPCW. He also has served as Permanent Representative of Spain to the United Nations in New York and Ambassador of Spain to Mali, Mauritania, former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Bulgaria.

== Findings by the Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organization ==
In 2002, the United States convened an extraordinary session of the Conference of the States Parties of the OPCW to request the dismissal of José Bustani, then Director General of the OPCW. Bustani was dismissed following the vote, held on 22 April 2002, with 48 states voting in favor, 7 against and 43 abstaining. Subsequently, Bustani accused the United States of having provoked his impeachment because he had succeeded in convincing Saddam Hussein to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention, which implied inspection of the Iraqi arsenal by OPCW investigators and would have thwarted the American plan of an invasion of Iraq. He also lodged a complaint before the Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organization, which, by a judgment of 16 July 2003, quashed the dismissal and condemned the OPCW to compensation for material and moral damage. Bustani did not seek to be reinstated in office.

<text>The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) is an international financial institution and a specialised agency of the United Nations that works to address poverty and hunger in rural areas of developing countries. It is the only multilateral development organization that focuses solely on rural economies and food security.

IFAD is involved in over 200 projects across nearly 100 countries. It funds and sponsors initiatives that improve land and water management, develop rural infrastructure, train and educate farmers in more efficient technologies, build up resilience against climate change, enhancing market accessibility, and more.

IFAD has 180 member states with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). As of 2021, since its foundation, IFAD has provided US$23.2 billion in loans and grants and coordinated an addition US$31 billion in international and domestic co-financing.

==History==
In the early 1970s, global food shortages led to widespread famine, malnutrition, and mortality, particularly affecting the Sahel region of Africa. The world required long-term, coordinated approaches to the structural issues that were causing destitution and food shortages. IFAD was established as an international financial institution in 1977 through United Nations General Assembly Resolution 32/107 (15 December 1977) as one of the major outcomes of the 1974 World Food Conference. The conference highlighted the vital importance of addressing food insecurity and poverty in emerging countries&#x27; rural communities. IFAD officially opened its headquarters in Rome, Italy and convened its first governing council with 120 member states and it is a member of the United Nations Development Group.

==Vision==
The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) envisions rural communities that are inclusive, prosperous, and resilient, free from poverty and hunger. Acknowledging that agriculture is the primary livelihood for millions of rural people, IFAD addresses the challenges these communities face, such as climate adaptation, economic instability, and food insecurity.

Through strategic partnerships and financing, IFAD supports initiatives that enable rural populations to enhance productivity, access resources, and build resilience. Its vision includes fostering innovation and advancing policies that promote equity, with a focus on empowering groups often overlooked, such as women, Indigenous Peoples, and youth.

==Structure==
The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) relies on three key entities for governance: the governing council, the executive board, and the president.

=== Governing Council ===
The IFAD is governed by its primary decision-making body, the Governing Council, which holds full powers to make decisions. This council is composed of representatives from all IFAD Member States and gathers on an annual basis. It is attended by official delegates such as Governors, Alternate Governors, and other appointed advisors. Observers, including representatives from non-member states seeking membership, the Holy See, the Sovereign Order of Malta, and approved UN agencies, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, are also invited to attend.

The Governing Council has full authority over the fund&#x27;s operations and makes decisions on important matters such as the approval of new members, the election of the President, issues concerning the permanent seat, the administrative budget, and the establishment of policies, criteria, and regulations.

Sessions of the Governing Council are led by the Chairperson of the Bureau, which is made up of one Chairperson and two Vice-chairpersons, all elected from among the Governors of member states for a two-year period. The President also participates in Governing Council meetings without voting rights.

=== Executive Board ===
The general operations of the fund are managed by the Executive Board, which exercises authority either directly provided by Agreement of Establishing the IFAD or delegated by the Governing Council. The Board is made up of 18 members and as many as 18 alternate members, all elected from the fund&#x27;s members at the annual session of the Governing Council. Each member serves a three-year term within allocated Lists and Sub-Lists. The fund&#x27;s president chairs the executive board, attending its meetings without voting privileges.

==== Current framework of the Executive Board ====

=== President ===
The President of the IFAD is appointed by the Governing Council with a two-thirds majority vote and serves a term of four years, renewable once. Under exceptional circumstances, the term may be extended by up to six months on the recommendation of the executive board. The president oversees the fund&#x27;s operations, including organizing the staff and managing appointments and dismissals, following regulations set by the executive board.

The President may appoint a Vice-president to assist with assigned responsibilities and serves as the fund&#x27;s legal representative. The current President of the IFAD is Alvaro Lario from Spain, who took over from Gilbert Houngbo in late 2022. His term of office began on 1 October 2022, and will run until 31 March 2027. As 2024, Álvaro Lario, who serves as the President of IFAD, took on the additional role of Chair of UN-Water, the United Nations Inter-Agency Mechanism on All Freshwater Related Issues, Including Sanitation.
==Membership==
&quot;Membership of the Fund shall be open to any State member of the United Nations, or of any of its specialized agencies, or of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Membership shall also be open to any groupings of States whose members have delegated to it powers in fields falling within the competence of the fund, and which is able to fulfil all the obligations of a Member of the Fund&quot; (Art. 3, sec. 1 of the Agreement Establishing IFAD).

IFAD currently has 180 member states, categorized into three main groups that reflect the economic diversity and development priorities of its members.

List A includes high-income countries that contribute significantly to IFAD&#x27;s financial resources. These nations have declared themselves ineligible for IFAD financing and do not qualify for Official Development Assistance (ODA) as defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Their role is crucial in providing funding for global agricultural development initiatives.

List B includes member states from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) that also contribute to IFAD&#x27;s resources. This category comprises oil-rich countries that may be eligible for particular agricultural development initiatives, demonstrating development aid.

List C includes developing nations eligible for IFAD money and services, many of which also contribute to the organization&#x27;s resources. This list is divided into three regional sub-lists: C1 (countries in Africa), C2 (countries in Europe, Asia, and the Pacific) and C3 (countries in Latin America and Caribbean).

<text>Auger electron spectroscopy (AES; pronounced in French) is a common analytical technique used specifically in the study of surfaces and, more generally, in the area of materials science. It is a form of electron spectroscopy that relies on the Auger effect, based on the analysis of energetic electrons emitted from an excited atom after a series of internal relaxation events. The Auger effect was discovered independently by both Lise Meitner and Pierre Auger in the 1920s. Though the discovery was made by Meitner and initially reported in the journal &quot;Zeitschrift für Physik&quot; in 1922, Auger is credited with the discovery in most of the scientific community. Until the early 1950s Auger transitions were considered nuisance effects by spectroscopists, not containing much relevant material information, but studied so as to explain anomalies in X-ray spectroscopy data. Since 1953 however, AES has become a practical and straightforward characterization technique for probing chemical and compositional surface environments and has found applications in metallurgy, gas-phase chemistry, and throughout the microelectronics industry.

==Electron transitions and the Auger effect==

The Auger effect is an electronic process at the heart of AES resulting from the inter- and intrastate transitions of electrons in an excited atom. When an atom is probed by an external mechanism, such as a photon or a beam of electrons with energies in the range of several eV to 50 keV, a core state electron can be removed leaving behind a hole. As this is an unstable state, the core hole can be filled by an outer shell electron, whereby the electron moving to the lower energy level loses an amount of energy equal to the difference in orbital energies. The transition energy can be coupled to a second outer shell electron, which will be emitted from the atom if the transferred energy is greater than the orbital binding energy. An emitted electron will have a kinetic energy of:

:formula_1

where formula_2, formula_3, formula_4 are respectively the core level, first outer shell, and second outer shell electron binding energies (measured from the vacuum level) which are taken to be positive. The apostrophe (tic) denotes a slight modification to the binding energy of the outer shell electrons due to the ionized nature of the atom; often however, this energy modification is ignored in order to ease calculations. Since orbital energies are unique to an atom of a specific element, analysis of the ejected electrons can yield information about the chemical composition of a surface. Figure 1 illustrates two schematic views of the Auger process.

The types of state-to-state transitions available to electrons during an Auger event are dependent on several factors, ranging from initial excitation energy to relative interaction rates, yet are often dominated by a few characteristic transitions. Because of the interaction between an electron&#x27;s spin and orbital angular momentum (spin-orbit coupling) and the concomitant energy level splitting for various shells in an atom, there are a variety of transition pathways for filling a core hole. Energy levels are labeled using a number of different schemes such as the j-j coupling method for heavy elements (&quot;Z&quot; ≥ 75), the Russell-Saunders L-S method for lighter elements (&quot;Z&quot; &lt; 20), and a combination of both for intermediate elements. The j-j coupling method, which is historically linked to X-ray notation, is almost always used to denote Auger transitions. Thus for a formula_5 transition, formula_6 represents the core level hole, formula_7 the relaxing electron&#x27;s initial state, and formula_8 the emitted electron&#x27;s initial energy state. Figure 1(b) illustrates this transition with the corresponding spectroscopic notation. The energy level of the core hole will often determine which transition types will be favored. For single energy levels, i.e. &quot;K&quot;, transitions can occur from the L levels, giving rise to strong KLL type peaks in an Auger spectrum. Higher level transitions can also occur, but are less probable. For multi-level shells, transitions are available from higher energy orbitals (different &quot;n, ℓ&quot; quantum numbers) or energy levels within the same shell (same &quot;n&quot;, different &quot;ℓ&quot; number). The result are transitions of the type LMM and KLL along with faster Coster–Kronig transitions such as LLM. While Coster–Kronig transitions are faster, they are also less energetic and thus harder to locate on an Auger spectrum. As the atomic number Z increases, so too does the number of potential Auger transitions. Fortunately, the strongest electron-electron interactions are between levels that are close together, giving rise to characteristic peaks in an Auger spectrum. KLL and LMM peaks are some of the most commonly identified transitions during surface analysis. Finally, valence band electrons can also fill core holes or be emitted during KVV-type transitions.

Several models, both phenomenological and analytical, have been developed to describe the energetics of Auger transitions. One of the most tractable descriptions, put forth by Jenkins and Chung, estimates the energy of Auger transition ABC as:

:formula_9

formula_10 are the binding energies of the formula_11th level in element of atomic number &quot;Z&quot; and formula_12 are the energies of the same levels in the next element up in the periodic table. While useful in practice, a more rigorous model accounting for effects such as screening and relaxation probabilities between energy levels gives the Auger energy as:

:formula_13

where formula_14 is the energy of interaction between the &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; level holes in a final atomic state &quot;x&quot; and the &quot;R&quot;&#x27;s represent intra- and extra-atomic transition energies accounting for electronic screening. Auger electron energies can be calculated based on measured values of the various formula_15 and compared to peaks in the secondary electron spectrum in order to identify chemical species. This technique has been used to compile several reference databases used for analysis in current AES setups.

==Experimental setup and quantification==

===Instrumentation===

Surface sensitivity in AES arises from the fact that emitted electrons usually have energies ranging from 50 eV to 3 keV and at these values, electrons have a short mean free path in a solid. The escape depth of electrons is therefore localized to within a few nanometers of the target surface, giving AES an extreme sensitivity to surface species. Because of the low energy of Auger electrons, most AES setups are run under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. Such measures prevent electron scattering off of residual gas atoms as well as the formation of a thin &quot;gas (adsorbate) layer&quot; on the surface of the specimen, which degrades analytical performance. A typical AES setup is shown schematically in figure 2. In this configuration, focused electrons are incident on a sample and emitted electrons are deflected into a cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA). In the detection unit, Auger electrons are multiplied and the signal sent to data processing electronics. Collected Auger electrons are plotted as a function of energy against the broad secondary electron background spectrum. The detection unit and data processing electronics are collectively referred to as the electron energy analyzer.

Since the intensity of the Auger peaks may be small compared to the noise level of the background, AES is often run in a derivative mode that serves to highlight the peaks by modulating the electron collection current via a small applied AC voltage. Since this formula_16, the collection current becomes formula_17. Taylor expanding gives:

:formula_18

Using the setup in figure 2, detecting the signal at frequency ω will give a value for formula_19 or formula_20. Plotting in derivative mode also emphasizes Auger fine structure, which appear as small secondary peaks surrounding the primary Auger peak. These secondary peaks, not to be confused with high energy satellites, which are discussed later, arise from the presence of the same element in multiple different chemical states on a surface (i.e. Adsorbate layers) or from relaxation transitions involving valence band electrons of the substrate. Figure 3 illustrates a derivative spectrum from a copper nitride film clearly showing the Auger peaks. The peak in derivative mode is not the true Auger peak, but rather the point of maximum slope of &quot;N(E)&quot;, but this concern is usually ignored.
===Quantitative analysis===

Semi-quantitative compositional and element analysis of a sample using AES is dependent on measuring the yield of Auger electrons during a probing event. Electron yield, in turn, depends on several critical parameters such as electron-impact cross-section and fluorescence yield. Since the Auger effect is not the only mechanism available for atomic relaxation, there is a competition between radiative and non-radiative decay processes to be the primary de-excitation pathway. The total transition rate, ω, is a sum of the non-radiative (Auger) and radiative (photon emission) processes. The Auger yield, formula_21, is thus related to the fluorescence (x-ray) yield, formula_22, by the relation,

:formula_23

where formula_24 is the X-ray transition probability and formula_25 is the Auger transition probability. Attempts to relate the fluorescence and Auger yields to atomic number have resulted in plots similar to figure 4. A clear transition from electron to photon emission is evident in this chart for increasing atomic number. For heavier elements, x-ray yield becomes greater than Auger yield, indicating an increased difficulty in measuring the Auger peaks for large Z-values. Conversely, AES is sensitive to the lighter elements, and unlike X-ray fluorescence, Auger peaks can be detected for elements as light as lithium (&quot;Z&quot; = 3). Lithium represents the lower limit for AES sensitivity since the Auger effect is a &quot;three state&quot; event necessitating at least three electrons. Neither H nor He can be detected with this technique. For K-level based transitions, Auger effects are dominant for &quot;Z&quot; &lt; 15 while for L- and M-level transitions, AES data can be measured for &quot;Z&quot; ≤ 50. The yield limits effectively prescribe a cutoff for AES sensitivity, but complex techniques can be utilized to identify heavier elements, such as uranium and americium, using the Auger effect.

Another critical quantity that determines yield of Auger electrons at a detector is the electron impact cross-section. Early approximations (in cm2) of the cross-section were based on the work of Worthington and Tomlin,

:formula_26

with &quot;b&quot; acting as a scaling factor between 0.25 and 0.35, and &quot;C&quot; a function of the primary electron beam energy, formula_27. While this value of formula_28 is calculated for an isolated atom, a simple modification can be made to account for matrix effects:

:formula_29

where α is the angle to the surface normal of the incident electron beam; &quot;rm&quot; can be established empirically and encompasses electron interactions with the matrix such as ionization due to backscattered electrons. Thus the total yield can be written as:
:formula_30

Here &quot;Nx&quot; is the number of &quot;x&quot; atoms per volume, λ the electron escape depth, θ the analyzer angle, &quot;T&quot; the transmission of the analyzer, &quot;I(t)&quot; the electron excitation flux at depth &quot;t&quot;, dΩ the solid angle, and δt is the thickness of the layer being probed. Encompassed in these terms, especially the Auger yield, which is related to the transition probability, is the quantum mechanical overlap of the initial and final state wave functions. Precise expressions for the transition probability, based on first-order perturbation Hamiltonians, can be found in Thompson and Baker. Often, all of these terms are not known, so most analyses compare measured yields with external standards of known composition. Ratios of the acquired data to standards can eliminate common terms, especially experimental setup characteristics and material parameters, and can be used to determine element composition. Comparison techniques work best for samples of homogeneous binary materials or uniform surface layers, while elemental identification is best obtained from comparison of pure samples.

==Uses==

There are a number of electron microscopes that have been specifically designed for use in Auger spectroscopy; these are termed scanning Auger microscopes (SAMs) and can produce high resolution, spatially resolved chemical images. SAM images are obtained by stepping a focused electron beam across a sample surface and measuring the intensity of the Auger peak above the background of scattered electrons. The intensity map is correlated to a gray scale on a monitor with whiter areas corresponding to higher element concentration. In addition, sputtering is sometimes used with Auger spectroscopy to perform depth profiling experiments. Sputtering removes thin outer layers of a surface so that AES can be used to determine the underlying composition. Depth profiles are shown as either Auger peak height vs. sputter time or atomic concentration vs. depth. Precise depth milling through sputtering has made profiling an invaluable technique for chemical analysis of nanostructured materials and thin films. AES is also used extensively as an evaluation tool on and off fab lines in the microelectronics industry, while the versatility and sensitivity of the Auger process makes it a standard analytical tool in research labs. Theoretically, Auger spectra can also be utilized to distinguish between protonation states. When a molecule is protonated or deprotonated, the geometry and electronic structure is changed, and AES spectra reflect this. In general, as a molecule becomes more protonated, the ionization potentials increase and the kinetic energy of the emitted outer shell electrons decreases.

Despite the advantages of high spatial resolution and precise chemical sensitivity attributed to AES, there are several factors that can limit the applicability of this technique, especially when evaluating solid specimens. One of the most common limitations encountered with Auger spectroscopy are charging effects in non-conducting samples. Charging results when the number of secondary electrons leaving the sample is different from the number of incident electrons, giving rise to a net positive or negative electric charge at the surface. Both positive and negative surface charges severely alter the yield of electrons emitted from the sample and hence distort the measured Auger peaks. To complicate matters, neutralization methods employed in other surface analysis techniques, such as secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), are not applicable to AES, as these methods usually involve surface bombardment with either electrons or ions (i.e. flood gun). Several processes have been developed to combat the issue of charging, though none of them is ideal and still make quantification of AES data difficult. One such technique involves depositing conductive pads near the analysis area to minimize regional charging. However, this type of approach limits SAM applications as well as the amount of sample material available for probing. A related technique involves thinning or &quot;dimpling&quot; a non-conductive layer with Ar+ ions and then mounting the sample to a conductive backing prior to AES. This method has been debated, with claims that the thinning process leaves elemental artifacts on a surface and/or creates damaged layers that distort bonding and promote chemical mixing in the sample. As a result, the compositional AES data is considered suspect. The most common setup to minimize charging effects includes use of a glancing angle (~10°) electron beam and a carefully tuned bombarding energy (between 1.5 keV and 3 keV). Control of both the angle and energy can subtly alter the number of emitted electrons vis-à-vis the incident electrons and thereby reduce or altogether eliminate sample charging.

In addition to charging effects, AES data can be obscured by the presence of characteristic energy losses in a sample and higher order atomic ionization events. Electrons ejected from a solid will generally undergo multiple scattering events and lose energy in the form of collective electron density oscillations called plasmons. If plasmon losses have energies near that of an Auger peak, the less intense Auger process may become dwarfed by the plasmon peak. As Auger spectra are normally weak and spread over many eV of energy, they are difficult to extract from the background and in the presence of plasmon losses; deconvolution of the two peaks becomes extremely difficult. For such spectra, additional analysis through chemical sensitive surface techniques like x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is often required to disentangle the peaks. Sometimes an Auger spectrum can also exhibit &quot;satellite&quot; peaks at well-defined off-set energies from the parent peak. Origin of the satellites is usually attributed to multiple ionization events in an atom or ionization cascades in which a series of electrons is emitted as relaxation occurs for core holes of multiple levels. The presence of satellites can distort the true Auger peak and/or small peak shift information due to chemical bonding at the surface. Several studies have been undertaken to further quantify satellite peaks.

Despite these sometimes substantial drawbacks, Auger electron spectroscopy is a widely used surface analysis technique that has been successfully applied to many diverse fields ranging from gas phase chemistry to nanostructure characterization. A new class of high-resolving electrostatic energy analyzers, face-field analyzers (FFA) can be used for remote electron spectroscopy of distant surfaces or surfaces with large roughness or even with deep dimples. These instruments are designed as if to be specifically used in combined scanning electron microscopes (SEMs). &quot;FFA&quot; in principle have no perceptible end-fields, which usually distort focusing in most of analysers known, for example, well known CMA.

<doc id="36840" wikidata="Q730017" url="?curid=36840" title="P. J. O'Rourke">
<text>Patrick Jake O&#x27;Rourke (November 14, 1947 – February 15, 2022) was an American author, journalist, and political satirist who wrote twenty-two books on subjects as diverse as politics, cars, etiquette, and economics. &quot;Parliament of Whores&quot; and &quot;Give War a Chance&quot; both reached No. 1 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list.

After beginning his career writing for the &quot;National Lampoon&quot;, O&#x27;Rourke went on to serve as foreign affairs desk chief for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; where he reported from far-flung places. Later he wrote for a number of publications, including &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, the &quot;Daily Beast&quot;, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, and the &quot;Weekly Standard&quot;, and was a longtime panelist on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot;.

The &quot;Forbes Media Guide Five Hundred, 1994&quot; states, &quot;O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s original reporting, irreverent humor, and crackerjack writing makes for delectable reading. He never minces words or pulls his punches, whatever the subject.&quot;

==Life and career==
O&#x27;Rourke was born in Toledo, Ohio, the son of Delphine (née Loy), a housewife, and Clifford Bronson O&#x27;Rourke, a car salesman. O&#x27;Rourke had Irish ancestry that traces back to County Roscommon. He graduated from Toledo&#x27;s DeVilbiss High School in 1965, received his undergraduate degree from Miami University in 1969 and earned a Master of Arts in English at Johns Hopkins University. Many of O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s essays recount that during his student days he was a leftist, anti-war hippie, but that in the 1970s his political views underwent a &quot;volte-face&quot;. He emerged as a political observer and humorist rooted in libertarian conservatism.

O&#x27;Rourke wrote articles for several publications, including &quot;A.J. at N.Y.U.&quot; for &quot;The Rip Off Review of Western Culture&quot;, an underground magazine/comic book, in 1972, as well as pieces for the Baltimore underground newspaper &quot;Harry&quot; and the &quot;New York Ace&quot;, before joining &quot;National Lampoon&quot; in 1973, where he served as editor-in-chief, among other roles, and authored articles such as &quot;Foreigners Around the World&quot; and &quot;How to Drive Fast on Drugs While Getting Your Wing-Wang Squeezed and Not Spill Your Drink&quot;.

O&#x27;Rourke received a writing credit for &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Lemmings&quot; which helped launch the careers of Chevy Chase and Christopher Guest. He also co-wrote &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s 1964 High School Yearbook&quot; with Douglas Kenney. This inspired the cult comedy, &quot;Animal House&quot;, which launched the career of John Belushi.

Going freelance in 1981, O&#x27;Rourke had his work published in &quot;Playboy,&quot; &quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; &quot;Car and Driver&quot;, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. He became foreign-affairs desk chief at &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, where he remained until 2001. In 1996, he served as the conservative commentator in the point-counterpoint segment of &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. During the Bosnian genocide, O&#x27;Rourke referred to the American public&#x27;s lack of interest in Bosnia as a way to joke about &quot;the unspellables killing the unpronounceables&quot;.

O&#x27;Rourke published over 20 books, including three &quot;New York Times&quot; bestsellers. &quot;Parliament of Whores&quot; and &quot;Give War a Chance&quot; reached No. 1 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. He also wrote &quot;Modern Manners&quot; and &quot;Holidays in Hell.&quot; O&#x27;Rourke was a &quot;Real Time Real Reporter&quot; for &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot; covering the 2008 presidential election. In the UK, he was known as the face of a long-running series of television advertisements for British Airways in the 1990s.

O&#x27;Rourke also worked on screenplays in Hollywood, including Rodney Dangerfield&#x27;s &quot;Easy Money&quot;.

In 2009, O&#x27;Rourke described the nascent presidency of Barack Obama as &quot;the Carter administration in better sweaters&quot;. However, in 2016, he endorsed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. O&#x27;Rourke stated that his endorsement included her &quot;lies and empty promises&quot; and added &quot;She&#x27;s wrong about absolutely everything, but she&#x27;s wrong within normal parameters&quot;.

==Personal life==
From 1990 to 1993, O&#x27;Rourke was married to Amy Lumet, a daughter of movie director Sidney Lumet and a granddaughter of Lena Horne. In 1995, he married Tina Mallon; they had three children: daughters Elizabeth and Olivia and son Clifford. In an interview with the &quot;New Statesman&quot; published in January 2012, O&#x27;Rourke said, &quot;Despite my name, I wasn&#x27;t raised a Catholic. My mother was a Protestant, of a traditional American, vague kind: she belonged to the church that the nice people in the neighbourhood went to. My wife is a Catholic, the kids are Catholic, so I&#x27;m a Catholic fellow-traveller.&quot;

In September 2008, O&#x27;Rourke announced that he had been diagnosed with treatable rectal cancer, from which he expected &quot;a 95% chance of survival&quot;. O&#x27;Rourke died from lung cancer at his home in Sharon, New Hampshire, on February 15, 2022, at the age of 74.

==Writing==

O&#x27;Rourke was a proponent of gonzo journalism; one of his earliest and best-regarded pieces was &quot;How to Drive Fast on Drugs While Getting Your Wing-Wang Squeezed and Not Spill Your Drink&quot;, a &quot;National Lampoon&quot; article in March 1979. The article was republished in two of his books, &quot;Republican Party Reptile&quot; (1987) and &quot;Driving Like Crazy&quot; (2009).

O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s best-received book is &quot;Parliament of Whores,&quot; subtitled &quot;A Lone Humorist Attempts to Explain the Entire U.S. Government&quot;, whose main argument, according to the author, &quot;is that politics are boring&quot;. He described himself as a libertarian.

O&#x27;Rourke typed his manuscripts on an IBM Selectric typewriter, though he denied being a Luddite, asserting that his short attention span would have made focusing on writing on a computer difficult.

<doc id="36842" wikidata="Q719312" url="?curid=36842" title="Gossypium">
<text>Gossypium () is a genus of flowering plants in the tribe Gossypieae of the mallow family, Malvaceae, from which cotton is harvested. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Old and New Worlds. There are about 50 &quot;Gossypium&quot; species, making it the largest genus in the tribe Gossypieae, and new species continue to be discovered. The name of the genus is derived from the Arabic word &quot;goz&quot;, which refers to a soft substance. 

Cotton is the primary natural fibre used by humans today, amounting to about 80% of world natural fibre production. Where cotton is cultivated, it is a major oilseed crop and a main protein source for animal feed. Cotton is thus of great importance for agriculture, industry and trade, especially for tropical and subtropical countries in Africa, South America and Asia. Consequently, the genus &quot;Gossypium&quot; has long attracted the attention of scientists.

The origin of the genus &quot;Gossypium&quot; is dated to around 5–10 million years ago. &quot;Gossypium&quot; species are distributed in arid to semiarid regions of the tropics and subtropics. Generally shrubs or shrub-like plants, the species of this genus are extraordinarily diverse in morphology and adaptation, ranging from fire-adapted, herbaceous perennials in Australia to trees in Mexico. Most wild cottons are diploid, but a group of five species from America and Pacific islands are tetraploid, apparently due to a single hybridization event around 1.5 to 2 million years ago. The tetraploid species are &quot;G. hirsutum&quot;, &quot;G. tomentosum&quot;, &quot;G. mustelinum&quot;, &quot;G. barbadense&quot;, and &quot;G. darwinii&quot;.

Cultivated cottons are perennial shrubs, most often grown as annuals. Plants are 1–2 m high in modern cropping systems, sometimes higher in traditional, multiannual cropping systems, now largely disappearing. The leaves are broad and lobed, with three to five (or rarely seven) lobes. The seeds are contained in a capsule called a &quot;boll&quot;, each seed surrounded by fibres of two types. These fibres are the more commercially interesting part of the plant and they are separated from the seed by a process called ginning. At the first ginning, the longer fibres, called staples, are removed and these are twisted together to form yarn for making thread and weaving into high quality textiles. At the second ginning, the shorter fibres, called &quot;linters&quot;, are removed, and these are woven into lower quality textiles (which include the eponymous lint). Commercial species of cotton plant are &quot;G. hirsutum&quot; (97% of world production), &quot;G. barbadense&quot; (1–2%), &quot;G. arboreum&quot; and &quot;G. herbaceum&quot; (together, ~1%). Many varieties of cotton have been developed by selective breeding and hybridization of these species. Experiments are ongoing to cross-breed various desirable traits of wild cotton species into the principal commercial species, such as resistance to insects and diseases, and drought tolerance. Cotton fibres occur naturally in colours of white, brown, green, and some mixing of these.

==&quot;Gossypium&quot; genome==

A public genome sequencing effort of cotton was initiated in 2007 by a consortium of public researchers. They agreed on a strategy to sequence the genome of cultivated, allotetraploid cotton. &quot;Allotetraploid&quot; means that the genomes of these cotton species comprise two distinct subgenomes, referred to as the At and Dt (the &#x27;t&#x27; for tetraploid, to distinguish them from the A and D genomes of the related diploid species). The strategy is to sequence first the D-genome relative of allotetraploid cottons, &quot;G. raimondii&quot;, a wild South American (Peru, Ecuador) cotton species, because of its smaller size due essentially to less repetitive DNA (retrotransposons mainly). It has nearly one-third the number of bases of tetraploid cotton (AD), and each chromosome is only present once. The A genome of &quot;G. arboreum&quot;, the &#x27;Old-World&#x27; cotton species (grown in India in particular), would be sequenced next. Its genome is roughly twice the size of &quot;G. raimondii&quot;&#x27;s. Once both A and D genome sequences are assembled, then research could begin to sequence the actual genomes of tetraploid cultivated cotton varieties. This strategy is out of necessity; if one were to sequence the tetraploid genome without model diploid genomes, the euchromatic DNA sequences of the AD genomes would co-assemble and the repetitive elements of AD genomes would assemble independently into A and D sequences, respectively. Then there would be no way to untangle the mess of AD sequences without comparing them to their diploid counterparts.

The public sector effort continues with the goal to create a high-quality, draft genome sequence from reads generated by all sources. The public-sector effort has generated Sanger reads of BACs, fosmids, and plasmids, as well as 454 reads. These later types of reads will be instrumental in assembling an initial draft of the D genome. In 2010, two companies (Monsanto and Illumina), completed enough Illumina sequencing to cover the D genome of &quot;G. raimondii&quot; about 50x. They announced they would donate their raw reads to the public. This public relations effort gave them some recognition for sequencing the cotton genome. Once the D genome is assembled from all of this raw material, it will undoubtedly assist in the assembly of the AD genomes of cultivated varieties of cotton, but a lot of hard work remains.

<doc id="36845" wikidata="Q12091" url="?curid=36845" title="Henry Dunant">
<text>Henry Dunant (born Jean-Henri Dunant; 8 May 182830 October 1910), also known as Henri Dunant, was a Swiss humanitarian, businessman, social activist, and co-founder of the Red Cross. His humanitarian efforts won him the first Nobel Peace Prize in 1901.

Dunant was born in Geneva to a devout Calvinist family and had business interests in French Algeria and Tunisia. In 1859, while on his way to petition Napoleon III, he witnessed the aftermath of the Battle of Solferino in northern Italy. Horrified by the suffering of the wounded and the lack of care they received, Dunant took the initiative to organize the local population in providing aid for the soldiers. After returning to Geneva, he recorded his experiences in the book &quot;A Memory of Solferino&quot;, in which he advocated the formation of an organization that would provide relief for the wounded without discrimination in times of war. In February 1863, Dunant was a member of a five-person committee that sought to put his plan into action, which in effect founded the organization that would become the International Committee of the Red Cross. A year later, he took part in a diplomatic conference organized by the Swiss government that led to the signing of the First Geneva Convention.

Dunant became embroiled in a business scandal in 1867 which resulted in his bankruptcy and expulsion from the International Committee. He spent the next decades in poverty and obscurity, living in various places across Europe before settling in the Swiss village of Heiden. In 1895, Dunant was rediscovered by a journalist, which brought him renewed attention and support, and in 1901 he was awarded the first Nobel Peace Prize alongside French pacifist Frédéric Passy. He died in Heiden in 1910.

== Early life and education ==

Dunant was born in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1828 as the first son of businessman Jean-Jacques Dunant and Antoinette Dunant-Colladon. His family was devoutly Calvinist and had significant influence in Geneva society. His parents stressed the value of social work, and his father was active in helping orphans and parolees, while his mother worked with the sick and the poor.

Dunant grew up during the period of religious awakening known as the &quot;Réveil&quot;, and at age 18 he joined the Geneva Society for Almsgiving. In the following year, together with friends, he founded the so-called &quot;Thursday Association&quot;, a loose band of young men that met to study the Bible and help the poor, and he spent much of his free time engaged in prison visits and social work. On 30 November 1852, he founded the Geneva chapter of the YMCA and three years later he took part in the Paris meeting devoted to the founding of its international organization.

In 1849, at age 21, Dunant left the Collège de Genève due to poor grades and began an apprenticeship with the money-changing firm &quot;Lullin et Sautter&quot;. After its successful conclusion, he stayed as an employee of the bank.

== Algeria ==
In 1853, Dunant visited Algeria, Tunisia, and Sicily, on assignment with a company devoted to the &quot;colonies of Setif&quot; (&quot;Compagnie genevoise des Colonies de Sétif&quot;). Despite little experience, he successfully fulfilled the assignment. Inspired by the trip, he wrote his first book with the title &quot;An Account of the Regency in Tunis&quot; (&quot;Notice sur la Régence de Tunis&quot;), published in 1858.

In 1856, he created a business to operate in foreign colonies, and, after being granted a land concession by French-occupied Algeria, a corn-growing and trading company called the Financial and Industrial Company of Mons-Djémila Mills (&quot;Société financière et industrielle des Moulins des Mons-Djémila&quot;). However, the land and water rights were not clearly assigned, and the colonial authorities were not especially cooperative. As a result, in 1859 Dunant decided to appeal directly to French emperor Napoléon III, who was with his army in Lombardy at the time. France was fighting on the side of Piedmont-Sardinia against Austria in the Austro-Sardinian War. Napoleon&#x27;s headquarters were located in the small city of Solferino. Dunant wrote a flattering book full of praise for Napoleon III with the intention to present it to the emperor and then travelled to Solferino to meet with him personally.

== Battle of Solferino ==

Dunant arrived in Solferino on the evening of 24 June 1859, on the same day a battle between the two sides had occurred nearby. Forty thousand wounded, dying and dead remained on the battlefield, and there appeared to be little attempt to provide care. Shocked, Dunant himself took the initiative to organize the civilian population, especially the women and girls, to provide assistance to the injured and sick soldiers. They lacked sufficient materials and supplies, and Dunant himself organized the purchase of needed materials and helped erect makeshift hospitals. He convinced the population to service the wounded without regard to their side in the conflict as per the slogan &quot;Tutti fratelli&quot; (All are brothers) coined by the women of the nearby city Castiglione delle Stiviere. He also succeeded in gaining the release of Austrian doctors captured by the French and British.

== Red Cross founding history ==

After returning to Geneva early in July, Dunant decided to write a book about his experiences, which he titled &quot;Un Souvenir de Solferino&quot; (&quot;A Memory of Solferino&quot;). It was published in 1862 in an edition of 1,600 copies and was printed at Dunant&#x27;s own expense. In the book, he described the battle, its costs, and the chaotic circumstances afterwards. He also developed the idea that in the future a neutral organization should exist to provide care to wounded soldiers. He distributed the book to many leading political and military figures in Europe.

Dunant also began to travel through Europe to promote his ideas. His book was largely positively received, and the President of the Geneva Society for Public Welfare, jurist Gustave Moynier, made the book and its suggestions the topic of the 9 February 1863 meeting of the organization. Dunant&#x27;s recommendations were examined and positively assessed by the members. They created a five-person Committee to further pursue the possibility of their implementation and made Dunant one of the members. The others were Moynier, the Swiss army general Henri Dufour, and doctors Louis Appia and Théodore Maunoir. Their first meeting on 17 February 1863 is now considered the founding date of the International Committee of the Red Cross.

From early on, Moynier and Dunant had increasing disagreements and conflicts regarding their respective visions and plans. Moynier considered Dunant&#x27;s idea to establish neutrality protections for care providers unfeasible and advised Dunant not to insist upon this concept. However, Dunant continued to advocate this position in his travels and conversations with high-ranking political and military figures. This intensified the personal conflict between Moynier, who took a rather pragmatic approach to the project, and Dunant, who was the idealist among the five.

In October 1863, 14 states took part in a meeting in Geneva organized by the committee to discuss improving care for wounded soldiers. Dunant was a protocol leader during the meeting. A year later, on 22 August 1864, a diplomatic conference organized by the Swiss government led to the signing of the First Geneva Convention by 12 states. Dunant was in charge of organizing accommodation for the attendees.

== Forgotten period ==

Dunant&#x27;s businesses in Algeria had suffered. In April 1867, the bankruptcy of the financial firm &quot;Crédit Genevois&quot; led to a scandal involving Dunant. He declared bankruptcy. The social outcry in Geneva, a city deeply rooted in Calvinist traditions, also led to calls for him to separate himself from the International Committee. Already on 25 August 1867, he resigned as Secretary and, on 8 September 1867, he was fully removed from the committee. Dunant was condemned by the Geneva Trade Court on 17 August 1868 for deceptive practices in the bankruptcies. Due to their investments in the firm, his family and many of his friends were also heavily affected by the downfall of the company.

In February 1868, Dunant&#x27;s mother died. Later that year he was expelled from the YMCA, because he was the Geneva founder of it, and they felt his business failure tainted the group. In March 1867, he left his home city of Geneva, and would not return for the rest of his life. In the following years, Moynier likely used his influence to attempt to ensure that Dunant would not receive assistance and support from his friends. For example, the gold medal prize of &quot;Sciences Morales&quot; at the Paris World&#x27;s Fair did not go to Dunant as originally planned but to Moynier, Dufour, and Dunant together so that the prize money would only go to the committee as a whole. Napoléon III&#x27;s offer to take over half of Dunant&#x27;s debts if Dunant&#x27;s friends would secure the other half was also thwarted by Moynier&#x27;s efforts.

Dunant moved to Paris, where he lived in meagre conditions. However, he continued to pursue his humanitarian ideas and plans. During the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), he founded the Common Relief Society (&quot;Allgemeine Fürsorgegesellschaft&quot;) and soon after the Common Alliance for Order and Civilisation (&quot;Allgemeine Allianz für Ordnung und Zivilisation&quot;). He argued for disarmament negotiations and for the erection of an international court to mediate international conflicts. Later he worked for the creation of a world library, an idea which had echoes in future projects such as UNESCO.

In his continued pursuit and advocacy of his ideas, he further neglected his personal situation and income, falling further into debt and being shunned by his acquaintances. Despite being appointed an honorary member of the national Red Cross societies of Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden, Prussia and Spain, he was nearly forgotten in the official discourse of the Red Cross Movement, even as it was rapidly expanding to new countries. He lived in poverty, moving to various places between 1874 and 1886, including Stuttgart, Rome, Corfu, Basel, and Karlsruhe. In Stuttgart, he met the Tübingen University student Rudolf Müller with whom he would have a close friendship. In 1881, together with friends from Stuttgart, he went to the small Swiss resort village Heiden for the first time. In 1887 while living in London, he began to receive some monthly financial support from some distant family members. This enabled him to live a somewhat more secure existence, and he moved to Heiden in July. He spent the rest of his life there, and after 30 April 1892, he lived in a hospital and nursing home led by Dr. Hermann Altherr.

In Heiden, he met the young teacher Wilhelm Sonderegger and his wife Susanna; they encouraged him to record his life experiences. Sonderegger&#x27;s wife founded a branch of the Red Cross in Heiden and in 1890 Dunant became its honorary president. With Sonderegger, Dunant hoped to further promote his ideas, including publishing a new edition of his book. However, their friendship later was strained by Dunant&#x27;s unjustified accusations that Sonderegger, with Moynier in Geneva, was somehow conspiring against Dunant. Sonderegger died in 1904 at age 42. Despite their strained relationship, Dunant was deeply moved by the unexpected death. Wilhelm and Susanna Sonderegger&#x27;s admiration for Dunant, felt by both even after Dunant&#x27;s allegations, was passed on to their children. In 1935, their son René published a compilation of letters from Dunant to his father.

== Return to public memory ==
In September 1895, Georg Baumberger, the chief editor of the St. Gall newspaper &quot;Die Ostschweiz&quot;, wrote an article about the Red Cross founder, whom he had met and conversed with during a walk in Heiden a month earlier. The article entitled &quot;Henri Dunant, the founder of the Red Cross&quot;, appeared in the German Illustrated Magazine &quot;Über Land und Meer&quot;, and the article was soon reprinted in other publications throughout Europe. The article struck a chord, and he received renewed attention and support. He received the Swiss Binet-Fendt Prize and a note from Pope Leo XIII. Because of support from Russian tsarist widow Maria Feodorovna and other donations, his financial situation improved remarkably.

In 1897, Rudolf Müller, who was now working as a teacher in Stuttgart, wrote a book about the origins of the Red Cross, altering the official history to stress Dunant&#x27;s role. The book also contained the text of &quot;A Memory of Solferino&quot;. Dunant began an exchange of correspondence with Bertha von Suttner and wrote numerous articles and writings. He was especially active in writing about women&#x27;s rights, and in 1897 facilitated the founding of a &quot;Green Cross&quot; women&#x27;s organization whose only section was briefly active in Brussels.

== Nobel Peace Prize ==

In 1901, Dunant was awarded the first-ever Nobel Peace Prize for his role in founding the International Red Cross Movement and initiating the Geneva Convention. By public and private means, Müller, and later Norwegian military physician Hans Daae (who had received a copy of Müller&#x27;s book), advocated Dunant&#x27;s case to the Nobel committee over the course of 4 years. The award was jointly given to French pacifist Frédéric Passy, founder of the Peace League and active with Dunant in the Alliance for Order and Civilization. The official congratulations which he received from the International Committee finally represented the rehabilitation of Dunant&#x27;s reputation:

&quot;There is no man who more deserves this honour, for it was you, forty years ago, who set on foot the international organization for the relief of the wounded on the battlefield. Without you, the Red Cross, the supreme humanitarian achievement of the nineteenth century would probably have never been undertaken.&quot;

Moynier and the International Committee as a whole had also been nominated for the prize. Although Dunant was supported by a broad spectrum in the selection process, he was still a controversial candidate. Some argued that the Red Cross and the Geneva Convention had made war more attractive and imaginable by eliminating some of its suffering. Therefore, Müller, in a letter to the committee, argued that the prize should be divided between Dunant and Passy, who for some time in the debate had been the leading candidate to be the sole recipient of the prize. Müller also suggested that if a prize were to be warranted for Dunant, it should be given immediately because of his advanced age and ill health.

By dividing the prize between Passy, a pacifist, and Dunant, a humanitarian, the Nobel Committee set a precedent for the conditions of the Nobel Peace Prize selection which would have significant consequences in later years. A section of Nobel&#x27;s will had indicated that the prize should go to an individual who had worked to reduce or eliminate standing armies, or directly to promote peace conferences, which made Passy a natural choice for his peace work. On the other hand, the arguably distinct bestowal for humanitarian effort alone was seen by some as a wide interpretation of Nobel&#x27;s will. However, another part of Nobel&#x27;s testament marked the prize for the individual who had best enhanced the &quot;brotherhood of people,&quot; which could be interpreted more generally as seeing humanitarian work like Dunant&#x27;s as connected to peacemaking as well. Many recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize in later years can be assigned to either of these two categories first roughly established by the Nobel committee&#x27;s decision in 1901.

Hans Daae succeeded in placing Dunant&#x27;s part of the prize money, 104,000 Swiss Francs, in a Norwegian Bank and preventing access by his creditors. Dunant himself never spent any of the money during his lifetime, continuing to live simply and reserving it for bequests in his will to those who cared for him and charitable causes.

== Death and legacy ==

Among several other awards in the following years, in 1903 Dunant was given an honorary doctorate by the medical faculty of the University of Heidelberg. He lived in the nursing home in Heiden until his death. In the final years of his life, he suffered from depression and paranoia about pursuit by his creditors and Moynier. There were even days when Dunant insisted that the cook of the nursing home first taste his food before his eyes to protect him against possible poisoning. In his final years, he spurned and attacked Calvinism and organized religion generally. He was said to be agnostic.

According to his nurses, the final act of his life was to send a copy of Müller&#x27;s book to the Italian queen with a personal dedication. He died on 30 October 1910, and his final words were &quot;Where has humanity gone?&quot;

According to his wishes, he was buried without ceremony in the Sihlfeld Cemetery in Zürich. In his will, he donated funds to secure a &quot;free bed&quot; in the Heiden nursing home always to be available for a poor citizen of the region and deeded some money to friends and charitable organizations in Norway and Switzerland. The remaining funds went to his creditors partially relieving his debt; his inability to fully erase his debts was a major burden to him until his death.
His birthday, 8 May, is celebrated as the World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day. The former nursing home in Heiden now houses the Henry Dunant Museum. In Geneva and other places there are numerous streets, squares, and schools named after him. The Henry Dunant Medal, awarded every two years by the standing commission of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is its highest decoration.
His life is represented, with some fictional elements, in the film &quot;D&#x27;homme à hommes&quot; (1948), starring Jean-Louis Barrault, and the period of his life when the Red Cross was founded in the international film coproduction &quot;Henry Dunant: Red on the Cross&quot; (2006). In 2010 the Takarazuka Revue staged a musical based on his time in Solferino and the founding of the Red Cross entitled &quot;Dawn at Solferino, or Where has Humanity Gone?&quot;.
* In honour of Henry Dunant, the second highest peak in Switzerland was renamed from to (Peak Dunant) by Swiss Federal President Didier Burkhalter on 6 October 2014.
* Henry Dunant Hospital is a general hospital in Athens, Greece.
* The road where the headquarters of the Thai Red Cross Society is located is named Henri Dunant Road.
* In 2020 a submarine internet cable named &quot;Dunant&quot; was laid between Virginia Beach, (United States) and Saint-Hilaire-de-Riez, (France) financed by two private firms

<doc id="36847" wikidata="Q2485448" url="?curid=36847" title="Sports governing body">
<text>A sports governing body is a sports organization that has a regulatory or sanctioning function.

Sports governing bodies come in various forms and have a variety of regulatory functions, including disciplinary action for rule infractions and deciding on rule
changes in the sport that they govern. Governing bodies have different scopes. They may cover a range of sport at an internationally acceptable level, such as the International Olympic Committee and the International Paralympic Committee, or only a single sport at a national level, such as the Rugby Football League. National bodies will largely have to be affiliated with international bodies for the same sport. The first international federations were formed at the end of the 19th century.

== Types of sports governing bodies ==

Every sport has a different governing body that can define the way that the sport operates through its affiliated clubs and societies. This is because sports have different levels of difficulty and skill, so they can try to organize the people playing their sport by ability and by age. The different types of sport governing bodies are all shown below:

=== International sports federations ===
International sports federations are non-governmental non-profit organizations for a given sport (or a group of similar sport disciplines, such as aquatics or skiing) and administers its sport at the highest level. These federations work to create a common set of rules, promote their sport, and organize international competitions. International sports federations represent their sport at the Olympic level where applicable.

About 30 international sport federations are located in Switzerland, with about 20 or so in the Lausanne area, where the International Olympic Committee is located.

International federations for sports that do not participate in the Olympic Games are managed by equivalent organizations to the International Olympic Committee, such as the SportAccord.

International federations are typically organized with legislative and executive branches at the top. The legislative body is usually referred to as a congress or general assembly of the international federation and is responsible for defining its sports policies. It consists of all of the national federations, each of which receives one vote. On the other hand, the executive branch, which is often referred to as the council or executive committee, consists of elected members by the legislative branch and is responsible for directing, managing, and representing their federation.

=== Trusts ===
Trusts are organizations or groups that have control over the money that will be used to help someone else, such as the Youth Sport Trust.

=== National governing bodies ===

National governing bodies have the same objectives as those of an international federation, but within the scope of one country, or even part of a country, as the name implies. They support local clubs and are often responsible for national teams. National Olympic Committees and National Paralympic Committees are both a type of national federation, as they are responsible for a country&#x27;s participation in the Olympic Games and in the Paralympic Games respectively. However, a national governing body (NGB) can be different from a national federation due to government recognition requirements. Also, national governing bodies can be a supraorganization representing a range of unrelated organizations operating in a particular sport, as evident in the example of the Northern Ireland Federation of Sub-Aqua Clubs.

=== Event organizers ===
Multi-sport event organizers are responsible for the organization of an event that includes more than one sport. The best-known example is the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the organizer of the modern Olympic Games. General sports organizations are responsible for sports-related topics, usually for a certain group, such as the Catholic or Jewish sports groups. General sports organizations and multi-sport events also exist for other groups such as the Invictus Games for military veterans.

=== Professional leagues ===
Professional sports leagues are usually the highest level of play in sport, specifically if they consist of the best players around the world in a certain sport. Because of this, they usually work with national or international federations, but there is usually a separation between the different federations. Most North American professional leagues usually do not have amateur divisions, as the amateur divisions are mostly run in separate leagues. Also, most professional leagues are related to other leagues, as players usually attempt to play in the league with the highest level of play. Because of this, promotion and relegation can occur; or, in league systems without promotion and relegation, clubs in professional leagues can have a team in the minor leagues. This enables them to shuffle players who are not doing well to the minor leagues, which will inspire them to contribute more to the team by playing better.

== Criticisms ==
A 2014 study by the Institute for Human Rights and Business (IHRB) criticized major international sports governing bodies including the International Olympic Committee and FIFA for not having sufficient provisions for human and labor rights.

<text>The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS; also known as CEDEAO in French and Portuguese) is a regional political and economic union of twelve countries of West Africa. Collectively, the present and former members comprise an area of and have an estimated population of over 424.34 million.

Considered one of the pillar regional blocs of the continent-wide African Economic Community (AEC), the stated goal of ECOWAS is to achieve &quot;collective self-sufficiency&quot; for its member states by creating a single large trade bloc by building a full economic and trading union. Additionally, ECOWAS aims to raise living standards and promote economic development. The union was established on 28 May 1975, with the signing of the Treaty of Lagos, with its stated mission to promote economic integration across the region. A revised version of the treaty was agreed and signed on 24 July 1993 in Cotonou, the largest city in Benin.

ECOWAS&#x27;s published principles include equality and inter-dependence of member states, solidarity, self-reliance, cooperation and harmonization of policies, nonaggression, promotion of human rights, economic and social justice, and democratic governance.

Notably among ECOWAS&#x27;s protocols and plans are the ECOWAS Free Movement of Persons, Residences and Establishment Protocol and the Ecotour Action Plan 2019–2029. The &quot;Free Movement of Persons Protocol&quot; permits citizens the right to enter and reside in any member state&#x27;s territory, and the &quot;Ecotour Action Plan&quot; aims to develop and integrate the tourist industry of each member state.

ECOWAS also serves as a peacekeeping force in the region, with member states occasionally sending joint military forces to intervene in the bloc&#x27;s member countries at times of political instability and unrest.

In 2024, the military governments of Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali jointly announced their withdrawal from the bloc, after having been suspended following respective military takeovers in these countries. The withdrawal took effect on 29 January 2025.

== Member states ==
ECOWAS currently has 12 member states: five French-speaking, five English-speaking, and two Portuguese-speaking. All current members joined the community as founding members in May 1975, except Cape Verde which joined in 1977.

Morocco officially requested to join ECOWAS in February 2017. The application was endorsed in principle at the Summit of Heads of State in June 2017. However, Morocco&#x27;s bid for membership was stalled as West African economic actors feared goods imported through Morocco&#x27;s free trade agreements would flood the market of states within ECOWAS.

=== States that have withdrawn or been suspended ===
Arabic-speaking Mauritania was one of the founding members of ECOWAS in 1975 and decided to withdraw in December 2000. Mauritania signed a new associate-membership agreement in August 2017.

Mali was suspended from ECOWAS on 30 May 2021, following its second military coup within nine months. Guinea was also suspended on 8 September 2021, shortly after a military coup took place in the country. Sanctions were placed on both countries on 16 September. On 10 January 2022, Mali announced its decision to close its borders and recalled several ambassadors with ECOWAS in response to sanctions imposed for deferring elections for four years. On 28 January 2022, Burkina Faso was suspended from ECOWAS following a military coup. Niger was suspended from ECOWAS after the 2023 coup d&#x27;état and threatened with military intervention if President Mohamed Bazoum is not restored to office, causing the Nigerien crisis. Additionally, ECOWAS closed all land and air borders between other member states and Niger and instituted a no-fly zone on all commercial flights to and from Niger. The suspension removed all commercial and financial transactions and froze Niger&#x27;s assets in ECOWAS central banks. On 16 September 2023, Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso formed a military alliance, the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), following ECOWAS&#x27;s threat to intervene to restore civilian rule in Niger. On 21 November 2023, Niger&#x27;s military government asked the ECOWAS regional court to order the lifting of sanctions imposed on the country. Until the coup, aid from countries like the United States and international organizations like ECOWAS accounted for almost half of Niger&#x27;s annual budget. Following Niger&#x27;s ECOWAS suspension, Niger&#x27;s neighbours closed their borders to the country and 70 percent of its electricity, coming from Nigeria, was cut off. While these sanctions and consequences that have followed have impacted the individuals and economy of Niger, the government is not backing down. As a result of the suspension, children have not been able to attend school due to lack of supplies, and businesses are shutting down due to rising costs. Further, the ECOWAS lawyer pointed out that the Nigerien government is not recognized by ECOWAS and therefore does not have the power to ask the regional court for a removal of these sanctions.

On 28 January 2024, Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso announced via a joint statement that they were withdrawing from ECOWAS &quot;without delay&quot;. The three nations, all of which are currently ruled by military juntas, accused ECOWAS of implementing &quot;inhumane&quot; sanctions in order to reverse the coups in each nation. Under the ECOWAS protocol, immediate withdrawal is not possible, and the three member states could remain in the bloc for up to a year. ECOWAS said in a statement that &quot;Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali remain important members of the Community and the Authority remains committed to finding a negotiated solution to the political impasse.&quot;

On 24 February 2024, ECOWAS announced that it was lifting some sanctions against Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso. For Niger this included the border closures, the freezing of central bank and state assets, the suspension of commercial transactions, and the no-fly-zone for commercial flights to and from Niger. However, the political sanctions and targeted sanctions would remain in force. The communiqué said this was done for humanitarian reasons, but it was seen as a gesture of appeasement to dissuade the three junta-led states from withdrawing from the bloc. ECOWAS also lifted sanctions on Guinea and Guinea-Bissau.

In December 2024, ECOWAS heads of state of the member countries met finalize the decision regarding the withdrawal of Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, united under the AES. President of Senegal, Basirou Diomaye Faye, stated on December 8, 2024 that he was continuing to discuss with the three countries remaining in ECOWAS, while maintaining the Alliance of Sahel States, which he recognized as a security response in the Sahel region. On December 12, 2024, ECOWAS President Bola Tinubu confirmed the political will of ECOWAS leaders to reintegrate the three countries from the Alliance of Sahel States. On December 15, 2024, the Conference of Heads of State of ECOWAS adopted an exit transition period for Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, which begins on January 29, 2025 and ends on July 29, 2025. During this transition period, ECOWAS has indicated that any exit would be reversible. The AES rejected the proposal. Celebrations were held in the three countries to mark the formal exit on 29 January. ECOWAS noted the withdrawal, while calling for the continuance of existing arrangements for the free movement of people and goods, including requesting its own members still accept documents from the departing countries.

The Foreign Ministers of the Alliance of Sahel States met on January 26, 2025, in Ouagadougou &quot;in anticipation of future talks with ECOWAS&quot;, The Ministers reached a consensus on the overall approach to future negotiations with ECOWAS, in the best interest of the Sahelian populations. From January 29, 2025, begins the beginning of a six-month &quot;transition period&quot; after the official separation with the three Sahelian countries. The three Sahelian countries rejected any possibility of reversing their decision.

== History ==

ECOWAS was formed initially from the region&#x27;s former French, British and Portuguese colonies, and independent Liberia, following post-colonial independence throughout the region (particularly in the 1960s and 1970s). At independence, many African states were challenged in increasing economic development. Because these states could not address problems individually, there was a need for a regional approach and thus ECOWAS was founded. ECOWAS was formed to provide regional economic cooperation, but has since evolved to include political and military cooperation, as well.

The union was established on 28 May 1975, with the signing of the Treaty of Lagos, with its stated mission to promote economic integration across the region. A revised version of the treaty was agreed and signed on 24 July 1993 in Cotonou. Considered one of the pillar regional blocs of the continent-wide African Economic Community (AEC), the stated goal of ECOWAS is to achieve &quot;collective self-sufficiency&quot; for its member states by creating a single large trade bloc by building a full economic and trading union.

ECOWAS also serves as a peacekeeping force in the region, with member states occasionally sending joint military forces to intervene in the bloc&#x27;s member countries at times of political instability and unrest. ECOWAS facilitates peacekeeping through systematic collaboration with civil society, cooperation with development policies, and other activities with the goal to meet sub-regional security challenges. It has played an important role in monitoring transitional election in West Africa, and these mediation efforts have even been recognized within and outside the continent of Africa. In recent years these included interventions in Ivory Coast in 2003, Liberia in 2003, Guinea-Bissau in 2012, Mali in 2013, The Gambia in 2017, and Guinea-Bissau in 2022. Since its creation, ECOWAS has sent peacekeeping forces seven times.

In 2011, ECOWAS adopted its development blueprint for the next decade, &quot;Vision 2020&quot;, and, to accompany it, a Policy on Science and Technology (ECOPOST). However, it has had trouble achieving the goals outlined in the policy.

Covering a region known as a &quot;coup belt&quot;, ECOWAS, since the 1990s, has attempted to defend the region&#x27;s shift towards democracy against authoritarian attacks. According to the BBC, since 1990, 78% of the 27 coups in sub-Saharan Africa have taken place in former French colonies. This has led some to question whether French influence in Africa has a destabilising impact. The transition governments in Mali and Burkina Faso cancelled military agreements that allow for French troops to operate on their territory, and in the case of Mali, removed French as an official language. However, the group has been cited for mild and ineffective responses in the early 2020s, when three member countries experienced military coups d&#x27;état – two in Mali, one in Guinea, and two in Burkina Faso. When a fourth member, Niger, experienced a coup d&#x27;état in July 2023, ECOWAS was vocal in its condemnation and raised the possibility of military action if the deposed president was not reinstated by 7 August 2023. Due to the Nigerien military&#x27;s refusal to restore civilian rule, ECOWAS activated its standby force composed of all other members except for Mali, Burkina Faso, Guinea and Cape Verde.

On 6 July 2024, the military leaders of Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso signed a new pact to form a confederation, a political union of sovereign states. The confederation&#x27;s stated goal is to provide mutual defense, pool resources to build energy and communications infrastructure, establish a common market, implement a monetary union under proposed currency &quot;the Sahel&quot;, allow free movement of persons, enable industrialization, and invest in agriculture, mines and energy sectors, with the end goal of federalizing into a single sovereign state. The move is seen as a strong move away from ECOWAS, which has been pressing for a return to civilian rule.

== Structure ==

=== Overall ===
ECOWAS consists of two operating institutions to implement policies: the ECOWAS Commission and the ECOWAS Bank for Investment and Development (EBID) – formerly known as the Fund for Cooperation, until it was renamed in 2001.

In addition, ECOWAS includes the following institutions: ECOWAS Commission, Community Court of Justice, Community Parliament, ECOWAS Bank for Investment and Development (EBID), West African Health Organisation (WAHO), and the Inter-Governmental Action Group against Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing in West Africa (GIABA).

ECOWAS includes two sub-regional blocks:

* The West African Economic and Monetary Union (also known by its French-language acronym UEMOA) is an organisation of eight, mainly French-speaking, states within ECOWAS which share a customs union and currency union. Established in 1994 and intended to counterbalance the dominance of English-speaking economies in the bloc (such as Nigeria and Ghana), members of UEMOA are mostly former territories of French West Africa. The currency they all use is the CFA franc, which is pegged to the euro.
* The West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ), established in 2000, comprises six mainly English-speaking countries within ECOWAS which plan to work towards adopting their own common currency, the eco.

ECOWAS operates in three co-official languages—French, English, and Portuguese.

=== Executive secretaries and presidents of the commission ===
=== Chairpersons===
=== Regional security co-operation ===

ECOWAS nations signed a non-aggression protocol in 1990 along with two earlier agreements in 1978 and 1981. They also signed a Protocol on Mutual Defence Assistance in Freetown, Sierra Leone, on 29 May 1981, that provided for the establishment of an Allied Armed Force of the Community.

=== Community Parliament ===
The Community Parliament consists of 115 members, distributed based on the population of each member state. This body is headed by the Speaker of the Parliament, who is above the Secretary General.

=== Expanded ECOWAS Commission ===
For the third time since its inception in 1975, ECOWAS is undergoing institutional reforms. The first was when it revised its treaty on 24 July 1993; the second was in 2007 when the Secretariat was transformed into a Commission. As of July 2013, ECOWAS now has six new departments (Human Resources Management; Education, Science and Culture; Energy and Mines; Telecommunications and IT; Industry and Private Sector Promotion). Finance and Administration to Sierra Leone has been decoupled, to give the incoming Ghana Commissioner the new portfolio of Administration and Conferences.

=== Community Court of Justice ===
ECOWAS Community Court of Justice was created by a protocol signed in 1991 and was later included in Article 6 of the Revised Treaty of the Community in 1993. However, the Court did not officially begin operations until the 1991 protocol came into effect on 5 November 1996. The jurisdiction of the court is outlined in Article 9 and Articles 76 of the Revised Treaty and allows rulings on disputes between states over interpretations of the Revised Treaty. It also provides ECOWAS Council with advisory opinions on legal issues (Article 10). Like its companion courts, the European Court of Human Rights and East African Court of Justice, it has jurisdiction to rule on fundamental human rights breaches.

=== Sporting and cultural exchange ===
ECOWAS nations organise a broad array of cultural and sports events under the auspices of the body, including the CEDEAO Cup in football, the 2012 ECOWAS Games and the Miss CEDEAO beauty pageant.

The Community Heads of State and Government adopted African Traditional Wrestling as the Community sport, and through its specialised agency in charge of youth and sports development, the Ouagadougou-based ECOWAS Youth and Sports Development Centre (EYSDC), has consistently organised the yearly ECOWAS African Wrestling Tournament mainly in Dakar (Senegal) and Niamey (Niger) based on a harmonized African wrestling code.

The Community, through the EYSDC, also organized 2 editions of ECOWAS International Cycling tour, taking close to 100 riders from all member states, from Lagos to Accra and then from Lagos to Abidjan. In addition to the sports and well-being objective of the tour, the race also served to demonstrate and put into practice ECOWAS protocol on free movement of goods and persons.

In 2019, the EYSDC instituted ECOWAS Abuja International Marathon. The first edition brought together international marathoners from West Africa, Kenya, Ethiopia and Cameroon.

Similarly, the Community, through its specialised agency, promotes regional sports development by offering sponsorship to regional sports federations and specialized disciplines such as the West African Deaf Sports Union (WADSU), the West African Liaison Office of the International Council for Military Sports (WALO-CISM), the Region 2 of the African Athletics Federation, and the West African University Games (WAUG), among others.

=== Youth ===
The ECOWAS Youth Policy Strategic Plan of Action (SPAO) is a 10-year plan that aims to promote youth development and empowerment in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The SPAO was adopted in 2016 and is based on the pillars of education and training, employment and entrepreneurship, health and well-being, peace and security, and governance and participation.

The SPAO identifies a number of challenges facing youth in ECOWAS, including high unemployment rates, lack of access to education and training, and poor health outcomes. The plan sets out a number of strategies to address these challenges, including investing in education and training, creating jobs and supporting entrepreneurship, improving access to health care, promoting peace and security, and strengthening youth participation in governance.

== Economic integration ==

=== West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA) ===

Formed in 1994 on the basis of earlier arrangements whose roots lie in the colonial era of French West Africa, the West African Economic and Monetary Union, often referred to by its French acronym UEMOA, brings together eight West African states of which seven were French colonies until the late 1950s. The member countries use the West African CFA franc as their currency and share common institutions including the Central Bank of West African States, Banking Commission of the West African Monetary Union, Financial Markets Authority of the West African Monetary Union, and (together with other African countries of the Franc Zone) Regional Insurance Control Commission.

=== West African Monetary Zone ===

Formed in 2000, the West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) is a group of six countries within ECOWAS that plan to introduce a common currency called the eco. The six member states of WAMZ are Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria and Sierra Leone who founded the organisation together in 2000 and Liberia who joined on 16 February 2010. Apart from Guinea, which is francophone, they are all English-speaking countries. Along with Mauritania, Guinea opted out of the CFA franc currency shared by all other former French colonies in West and Central Africa.

The WAMZ attempts to establish a strong stable currency to rival the CFA franc, whose exchange rate is tied to that of the euro and is guaranteed by the French Treasury. The eventual goal is for the CFA franc and eco to merge, giving all of West and Central Africa a single, stable currency. The launch of the new currency is being developed by the West African Monetary Institute based in Accra, Ghana.

=== The Free Movement of Persons, Residence and Establishment Protocol ===
In May 1979, ECOWAS adopted a Free Movement of Persons, Residence and Establishment Protocol, which permits citizens to enter, reside, and establish economic activities in the territory of member states. There were three phases of implementation to achieve the goals of the protocol. Over the course of five years, Phase I eliminated the need for visas for stays of up to 90 days within the ECOWAS territory. Phase II attempted to extend residency to citizens in host ECOWAS states to seek income-earning employment after obtaining an ECOWAS residence card. Phase II also required member states to grant migrant workers equal treatment in areas such as employment, participation, social and cultural activities, and in certain cases of job loss, re-employment, and training. Phase III centered on the facilitation and establishment of business through the right of citizens to manage economic activities in countries other than their country of origin. However, this right has not been fully established in the ECOWAS region. While these three phases promoting freedom of movement within the ECOWAS region is more advanced than in any other regional grouping in Africa, only the first phase has been fully implemented by all ECOWAS countries. The complete implementation of the 90-day visa-free window enhanced human mobility in the region, creating positive impacts on trade and economic development.

In December 2000, the ECOWAS passport was introduced as a common passport that functions as an international travel document, and member states are currently in the process of implementing a joint visa for non-ECOWAS citizens. Additionally, ECOWAS has worked to ease the movement of people transported in private and commercial vehicles by implementing policies that enable vehicles to enter and reside in a State for up to ninety days. Most ECOWAS states have instituted an ECOWAS brown card, which provides prompt, fair, and immediate compensation for any motor accident which occurs outside a motorist&#x27;s home-country.

While monitoring committees exist to ensure all three phases of the protocol are successfully implemented, their work is vague and has not been credited with effective and efficient production of data. The largest challenges assosicated within the implementation of the protocol occur due to lack of commitment and enforceability. More so, there is a lack of access to readily available migrant information in the ECOWAS region. This poses a barrier to freedom of movement as immigration officials in member states are unaware that individuals who hold valid travel documents can enter their country freely. Therefore, West African migrants, who are entitled to enter through regular channels, leave their countries without proper travel documents and enter other countries illegally. This illegal and irregular entry poses a barrier towards gaining reliable travel statistics.

For example, Francophone countries in the region have issued national identity cards that can be used similarly to a passport. These cards permit citizens to cross borders after presenting their identity cards. However, Anglophone countries have only just begun distributing a similar form of identification. Consequently, immigration officials in Anglophone countries commonly reject Francophone national identity cards and do not permit Francophone citizens to cross into their borders. Further, these structural barriers are exasperated between different social classes. Middle-class individuals typically experience a smoother border-crossing process than working-class individuals and impoverished citizens who do not have travel documents and are not fluent in the language of the countries they are crossing into.

== Transport ==
A Trans-ECOWAS project, established in 2007, plans to upgrade railways in this zone.

==Tourism==
In 2019, ECOWAS unveiled its Ecotour Action Plan 2019 – 2029. It focuses on tourism heritage protection and development and on the development of standards, regulations, and control systems. The plan includes five programs for implementation, and detailed mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation. Ecotourism is not specifically developed, yet it has been mentioned that the program has the opportunity to create linkages between institutions and stakeholder collaboration to suit ecotourism projects that prioritize community, biodiversity, and socioeconomics. The Ecotour Plan prioritizes local development, especially in generating skilled and unskilled jobs for marginalized individuals, and aims to make the ECOWAS region a first-class tourist destination in Africa. During its creation, ECOWAS ministers also called on ecotourism programs to protect threatened biodiversity in the Guinean Forests, which span into seven ECOWAS member states. Similar to the Free Movement of People Protocol, Ecotour aims to integrate aviation and ground transportation. ECOWAS hopes that this regional approach will allow states to fight against pandemics such as COVID-19 to restore tourism and ecosystems. Ecotour works to create increasing returns to its members&#x27; economies by lowering transport costs, developing hospitality training centers and creating a more integrated use of digital technology.

As of March 2023, Council members mentioned that phases one and two of the Ecotour Action Plan have come to an end and that the community is moving into phase three and four, which focuses on the development of tourist accommodations establishments, and a proposal for a regional mechanism to enforce tourist regulations. By the end of phase five, ECOWAS hopes to have unified accommodations in hotels, ecolodges, motels, apart hotels, and hostels. In April 2023, tourism experts met to amend the new text for tourist accommodations in the ECOWAS region. This phase is critical to the success of the Ecotour plan as the lack of a regulatory system has been a barrier to the development of the tourism sector, despite its ability to increase member states&#x27; economies. During this conference, ministers improved the tourism industry by adopting standards for hotel services. Mrs. Massandjé Toure-Liste, the ECOWAS Commission&#x27;s Commissioner for Economic Affairs and Agriculture, pointed out the improvements in the tourist sector due to the African Continental Free Trade Area, a trade agreement signed by 44 members of the African Union which creates a single market for goods and services. Mrs. Toure-Liste praised the trade area for providing development opportunities, economic growth, and boosting regional integration.

<text>Paweł Jasienica was the pen name of Leon Lech Beynar (10 November 1909 – 19 August 1970), a Polish historian, journalist, essayist and soldier.

During World War II, Jasienica (then, Leon Beynar) fought in the Polish Army, and later, the Home Army resistance. Near the end of the war, he was also working with the anti-Soviet resistance, which later led to him taking up a new name, Paweł Jasienica, to hide from the communist government of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland. He was associated with the &quot;Tygodnik Powszechny&quot; weekly and several other newspapers and magazines. He is best known for his 1960s books on Polish historyon the Kingdom of Poland under the Piast dynasty, the Jagiellon dynasty, and the elected kings of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Those books, still popular, played an important role in popularizing Polish history among several generations of readers.

Jasienica became an outspoken critic of the censorship in the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland, and as a notable dissident, he was persecuted by the government. He was subject to significant invigilation (oversight) by the security services, and his second wife was in fact an agent of the communist secret police. For a brief period marking the end of his life, his books were prohibited from being distributed or printed.

==Life==

===Youth===
Beynar was born on 10 November 1909 in Simbirsk, Russia, to Polish parents, Mikołaj Beynar and Helena Maliszewska. His paternal grandfather, Ludwik Beynar, fought in the January Uprising and married a Spanish woman, Joanna Adela Feugas. His maternal grandfather, Wiktor Maliszewski, fought in the November uprising. Both of his grandfathers eventually settled in the Russian Empire. His father, Mikołaj, worked as an agronomist. Beynar&#x27;s family lived in Russia and Ukrainethey moved from Simbirsk to a location near Bila Tserkva and Uman, then to Kyiv until the Russian Revolution of 1917, after which they decided to settle in the independent Poland. After a brief stay in Warsaw, during the Polish–Soviet War, his family settled in Opatów, and in 1924, moved to Grodno.

Beynar graduated from &quot;gymnasium&quot; (secondary school) in Wilno (Vilnius) and graduated in history from Stefan Batory University in Wilno (his thesis concerned the January Uprising). At the university he was an active member of several organizations including &quot;Klub Intelektualistów&quot; (Intellectuals&#x27; Club) and &quot;Akademicki Klub Włóczęgów&quot; (Academic Club of Vagabonds). After graduating, he finished training for the officer cadet (&quot;podchorąży&quot;) in the Polish Army. From 1928 to 1937 he lived in Grodno, where he worked as a history teacher in a gymnasium; later he was employed as an announcer for Polish Radio Wilno. Here also, Beynar embarked on his career as author and essayist, writing for a Vilnius conservative newspaper, &quot;Słowo&quot; (The Word). On 11 November 1934 he married Władysława Adamowicz, and in 1938 his daughter Ewa was born. In 1935 he published his first history book – about King Sigismund II Augustus, &quot;Zygmunt August na ziemiach dawnego Wielkiego Księstwa&quot; (Sigismund Augustus on the Lands of the Former Grand Duchy [of Lithuania]).

===World War II===
During World War II, Beynar was a soldier in the Polish Army, fighting the German &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; when it invaded Poland in September 1939. He commanded a platoon near Sandomierz and was eventually taken prisoner by the Germans. While in a temporary prisoner-of-war camp in Opatów, he was able to escape with the help of some old school friends from the time his family lived there in the early 1920s. He joined the Polish underground organization, &quot;Związek Walki Zbrojnej&quot; (Association for Armed Combat), later transformed into the &quot;Armia Krajowa&quot; (&quot;AK&quot;; the Home Army), and continued the fight against the Germans. In the resistance he had the rank of lieutenant, worked in the local Wilno headquarters and was an editor of an underground newspaper &quot;Pobudka&quot;. He was also involved in the underground teaching. In July 1944 he took part in the operation aimed at the liberation of Wilno from the Germans (Operation Ostra Brama). In the wake of this operation, around 19–21 August, his partisan unit, like many others, was intercepted and attacked by the Soviets. He was taken prisoner; sources vary as to whether he was to be exiled to Siberia or conscripted into the Polish People&#x27;s Army. Either way he escaped and rejoined AK partisans (the Home Army 5th Wilno Brigade). For a while, he was an aide to Major Zygmunt Szendzielarz (&quot;Łupaszko&quot;) and was member of the anti-Soviet resistance, &quot;Wolność i Niezawisłość&quot; (&quot;WiN&quot;, Freedom and Independence). He was promoted to the rank of captain. Wounded in August 1945, he left the Brigade before it was destroyed by the Soviets, and avoided the fate of most of its officers who were sentenced to death. While recovering from his wounds, he found shelter in the village of Jasienica.

===Post-war===
After recovering from his wounds in 1945, Beynar decided to leave the resistance, and instead began publishing in an independent Catholic weekly &quot;Tygodnik Powszechny&quot;. It was then that he took the pen-name Jasienica (from the name of the place where he had received treatment for his injuries) in order not to endanger his wife, who was still living in Soviet-controlled Vilnius, Lithuania. Soon he became a member of the weekly&#x27;s staff and then an editor. In 1948 he was arrested by the Polish secret police () but after several weeks was released after the intervention of Bolesław Piasecki from the PAX Association. In gratitude to Piasecki, thereafter he worked with PAX, leaving &quot;Tygodnik Powszechny&quot; for PAX in 1950. In 1950, he became a director of the Polish Caritas charity. Jasienica became a member of the Crooked Circle Club, which espoused free speech and open discussion. His essays were published in &quot;Dziś i Jutro&quot;, &quot;Słowo Powszechne&quot;, &quot;Życie Warszawy&quot;, &quot;Po Prostu&quot;. From at least this period until his death he would live in Warsaw. His wife Władysława died 29 March 1965.

Over time, he became increasingly involved in various dissident organizations. In December 1959, he became a vice president of the Union of Polish Writers (&quot;Związek Literatów Polskich&quot;, ZLP). He also published in the magazine &quot;Świat&quot; (1951–1969). In 1962 he was the last president of the literary discussion society, Crooked Circle Club. In 1966 he was a vice president of the PEN Club. While in the late 1940s and 1950s he focused mostly on journalistic activity, later he turned to writing popular history in book format. In the 1960s he wrote his most famous works, historical books about history of Poland – the Kingdom of Poland in the times of the Piast dynasty, the Jagiellonian dynasty, and the era of elected kings (the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth). His book on Jagiellonian Poland was recognized as the best book of the year by the readers.

Jasienica was, however, very outspoken in his criticism of the censorship in the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland. On 29 February 1968 during a ZLP meeting, Jasienia presented a harsh critique of the government. These acts, and in particular his signing of the dissident Letter of 34 in 1964 against censorship and his involvement in the 1968 protests led to his being labeled a political dissident, for which he suffered government persecution. Partly as a response to government&#x27;s persecution of Jasienica, in 1968 the satirist Janusz Szpotański dedicated one of his anti-government poems, &quot;Ballada o Łupaszce&quot; (The Ballad of Łupaszko), written while Szpotański was in Mokotów Prison, to the writer. In the aftermath of the 1968 events, Polish communist media, and communist leader, Władysław Gomułka, on 19 March 1968, alleged that in 1948 Jasienica was freed because he collaborated with the communist regime; this allegation caused much controversy and damaged Jasienica&#x27;s reputation. He was subject to much invigilation (oversight) by the security services. In December 1969, five years after his first wife&#x27;s death, he remarried. This marriage proved to be highly controversial as it was discovered after his death that his second wife, Zofia Darowska O’Bretenny, had been a secret police informant before their marriage, and continued to write reports about him throughout their marriage. From 1968 until his death, his books were prohibited from being distributed or printed.

Jasienica died from cancer on 19 August 1970 in Warsaw. Some publicists later speculated to what extent his death was caused by &quot;hounding from the party establishment&quot;. He is buried in Warsaw&#x27;s Powązki Cemetery. His funeral was attended by many dissidents and became a political manifestation; Adam Michnik recalls seeing Antoni Słonimski, Stefan Kisielewski, Stanisław Stomma, Jerzy Andrzejewski, Jan Józef Lipski and Władysław Bartoszewski. Bohdan Cywiński read a letter from Antoni Gołubiew.

==Work==
Jasienica book publishing begun with a historical book, &quot;Zygmunt August na ziemiach dawnego Wielkiego Księstwa&quot; (Sigismund Augustus in the lands of the former Grand Duchy; 1935). He is best known for his highly acclaimed and popular historical books from the 1960s about Piast Poland, Jagiellon Poland and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth: &quot;Polska Piastów&quot; (Piast Poland, 1960), &quot;Polska Jagiellonów&quot; (Jagiellon Poland, 1963) and the trilogy &quot;Rzeczpospolita Obojga Narodów&quot; (The Commonwealth of Both Nations, 1967–1972). This trilogy made him one of the most popular Polish history writers. Throughout his life he avoided writing about modern history, to minimize the influence that the official, communist Marxist historiography would have on his works. This was also one of the reasons for the popularity of his works, which were seen as a rare, legally obtainable alternative to the official version of history. His books, publication of which resumed once again after his death, were labeled as &quot;best-selling&quot;, and became the most reprinted postwar history of Poland.

His (Two ways, 1959) about the January Uprising of the 1860s represent the latest historical period he has tackled. His other popular historical books include , (Three chroniclers; 1964), a book about three medieval chroniclers of Polish history (Thietmar of Merseburg, Gallus Anonymus and Wincenty Kadłubek), in which he discusses the Polish society through ages; and (Last of the Family; 1965) about the last queen of the Jagiellon dynasty, Anna Jagiellonka. His (1978; Thoughts on Civil War) were the last book he has finished; unlike the majority of his other works, this book is ostensibly about the civil war (Chouannerie) in Brittany, France. This work does however contains numerous arguments applicable to more modern Polish history; arguments that Jasienica thought would not be allowed by the censors if the book discussed Polish history.

In addition to historical books, Jasienica, wrote a series of essays about archeology – (Slavic genealogy; 1961) and (Archeological excerpts: reports; 1956), journalistic travel reports () and science and technology (). Those works were mostly created around the 1950s and 1960s.

His (Memoirs) was the work that he began shortly before his death, and that was never completely finished.

In 2006, Polish journalist and former dissident Adam Michnik said that:
Polish historian Henryk Samsonowicz echoes Michnik&#x27;s essay in his introduction to a recent (2008) edition of &quot;Trzej kronikarze&quot;, describing Jasienica as a person who did much to popularize Polish history. Hungarian historian Balázs Trencsényi notes that &quot;Jasienica&#x27;s impact of the formation of the popular interpretation of Polish history is hard to overestimate&quot;. British historian Norman Davies, himself an author of a popular account of Polish history (&quot;God&#x27;s Playground&quot;), notes that Jasienica, while more of &quot;a historical writer than an academic historian&quot;, had &quot;formidable talents&quot;, gained &quot;much popularity&quot; and that his works would find no equals in the time of communist Poland. Samsonowicz notes that Jasienica &quot;was a brave writer&quot;, going against prevailing system, and willing to propose new hypotheses and reinterpret history in innovative ways. Michnik notes how Jasienica was willing to write about Polish mistakes, for example in the treatment of Cossacks. Ukrainian historian Stephen Velychenko also positively commented on Jasienica&#x27;s extensive coverage of the Polish-Ukrainian history. Both Michnik and Samsonowicz note how Jasienica&#x27;s works contain hidden messages in which Jasienica discusses more contemporary history, such as in his &quot;Rozważania...&quot;.

<doc id="36856" wikidata="Q25241" url="?curid=36856" title="Vertebrate">
<text>Vertebrates () are animals with a vertebral column (backbone or spine), and a cranium, or skull. The vertebral column surrounds and protects the spinal cord, while the cranium protects the brain. 

The vertebrates make up the subphylum Vertebrata with some 65,000 species, by far the largest grouping in the phylum Chordata. The vertebrates include mammals, birds, amphibians, and various classes of fish and reptiles. The fish include the jawless Agnatha, and the jawed Gnathostomata. The jawed fish include both the cartilaginous fish and the bony fish. Bony fish include the lobe-finned fish, which gave rise to the tetrapods, the animals with four limbs. Despite their success, vertebrates still only make up less than five percent of all described animal species.

The first vertebrates appeared in the Cambrian explosion some 518 million years ago. Jawed vertebrates evolved in the Ordovician, followed by bony fishes in the Devonian. The first amphibians appeared on land in the Carboniferous. During the Triassic, mammals and dinosaurs appeared, the latter giving rise to birds in the Jurassic. Extant species are roughly equally divided between fishes of all kinds, and tetrapods. Populations of many species have been in steep decline since 1970 because of land-use change, overexploitation of natural resources, climate change, pollution and the impact of invasive species.

== Characteristics ==

=== Unique features ===

Vertebrates belong to Chordata, a phylum characterised by five synapomorphies (unique characteristics): namely a notochord, a hollow nerve cord along the back, an endostyle (often as a thyroid gland), and pharyngeal gills arranged in pairs. Vertebrates share these characteristics with other chordates. 

Vertebrates are distinguished from all other animals, including other chordates, by multiple synapomorphies: namely the vertebral column, skull of bone or cartilage, large brain divided into 3 or more sections, a muscular heart with multiple chambers; an inner ear with semicircular canals; sense organs including eyes, ears, and nose; and digestive organs including intestine, liver, pancreas, and stomach.

=== Physical ===

Vertebrates (and other chordates) belong to the Bilateria, a group of animals with mirror symmetrical bodies. They move, typically by swimming, using muscles along the back, supported by a strong but flexible skeletal structure, the spine or vertebral column. The name &#x27;vertebrate&#x27; derives from the Latin , &#x27;jointed&#x27;, from &quot;vertebra&quot;, &#x27;joint&#x27;, in turn from Latin , &#x27;to turn&#x27;.

As embryos, vertebrates still have a notochord; as adults, all but the jawless fishes have a vertebral column, made of bone or cartilage, instead. Vertebrate embryos have pharyngeal arches; in adult fish, these support the gills, while in adult tetrapods they develop into other structures. 

In the embryo, a layer of cells along the back folds and fuses into a hollow neural tube. This develops into the spinal cord, and at its front end, the brain. The brain receives information about the world through nerves which carry signals from sense organs in the skin and body. Because the ancestors of vertebrates usually moved forwards, the front of the body encountered stimuli before the rest of the body, favouring cephalisation, the evolution of a head containing sense organs and a brain to process the sensory information.

Vertebrates have a tubular gut that extends from the mouth to the anus. The vertebral column typically continues beyond the anus to form an elongated tail.

The ancestral vertebrates, and most extant species, are aquatic and carry out gas exchange in their gills. The gills are finely-branched structures which bring the blood close to the water. They are positioned just behind the head, supported by cartilaginous or bony branchial arches. In jawed vertebrates, the first gill arch pair evolved into the jaws. In amphibians and some primitive bony fishes, the larvae have external gills, branching off from the gill arches. Oxygen is carried from the gills to the body in the blood, and carbon dioxide is returned to the gills, in a closed circulatory system driven by a chambered heart. The tetrapods have lost the gills of their fish ancestors; they have adapted the swim bladder (that fish use for buoyancy) into lungs to breathe air, and the circulatory system is adapted accordingly. At the same time, they adapted the bony fins of the lobe-finned fishes into two pairs of walking legs, carrying the weight of the body via the shoulder and pelvic girdles. 

Vertebrates vary in size from the smallest frog species such as &quot;Brachycephalus pulex&quot;, with a minimum adult snout–vent length of to the blue whale, at up to and weighing some 150 tonnes.

=== Molecular ===

Molecular markers known as conserved signature indels in protein sequences have been identified and provide distinguishing criteria for the vertebrate subphylum. Five molecular markers are exclusively shared by all vertebrates and reliably distinguish them from all other animals; these include protein synthesis elongation factor-2, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, adenosine kinase and a protein related to ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase). A specific relationship between vertebrates and tunicates is supported by two molecular markers, the proteins Rrp44 (associated with the exosome complex) and serine C-palmitoyltransferase. These are exclusively shared by species from these two subphyla, but not by cephalochordates.

== Evolutionary history ==

=== Cambrian explosion: first vertebrates ===

Vertebrates originated during the Cambrian explosion at the start of the Paleozoic, which saw a rise in animal diversity. The earliest known vertebrates belong to the Chengjiang biota and lived about 518 million years ago. These include &quot;Haikouichthys&quot;, &quot;Myllokunmingia&quot;, &quot;Zhongjianichthys&quot;, and probably &quot;Yunnanozoon&quot;. Unlike other Cambrian animals, these groups had the basic vertebrate body plan: a notochord, rudimentary vertebrae, and a well-defined head and tail, but lacked jaws. A vertebrate group of uncertain phylogeny, small eel-like conodonts, are known from microfossils of their paired tooth segments from the late Cambrian to the end of the Triassic. Zoologists have debated whether teeth mineralized first, given the hard teeth of the soft-bodied conodonts, and then bones, or vice versa, but it seems that the mineralized skeleton came first.

=== Paleozoic: from fish to amphibians ===

The first jawed vertebrates may have appeared in the late Ordovician (~445 mya) and became common in the Devonian period, often known as the &quot;Age of Fishes&quot;. The two groups of bony fishes, Actinopterygii and Sarcopterygii, evolved and became common. By the middle of the Devonian, a lineage of sarcopterygii with both gills and air-breathing lungs adapted to life in swampy pools used their muscular paired fins to propel themselves on land. The fins, already possessing bones and joints, evolved into two pairs of walking legs. These established themselves as amphibians, terrestrial tetrapods, in the next geological period, the Carboniferous. A group of vertebrates, the amniotes, with membranes around the embryo allowing it to survive on dry land, branched from amphibious tetrapods in the Carboniferous.

=== Mesozoic: from reptiles to mammals and birds ===
At the onset of the Mesozoic, all larger vertebrate groups were devastated after the largest mass extinction in earth history. The following recovery phase saw the emergence of many new vertebrate groups that are still around today, and this time has been described as the origin of modern ecosystems. On the continents, the ancestors of modern lissamphibians, turtles, crocodilians, lizards, and mammals appeared, as well as dinosaurs, which gave rise to birds later in the Mesozoic. In the seas, various groups of marine reptiles evolved, as did new groups of fish. At the end of the Mesozoic, another extinction event extirpated dinosaurs (other than birds) and many other vertebrate groups.

=== Cenozoic: Age of Mammals ===

The Cenozoic, the current era, is sometimes called the &quot;Age of Mammals&quot;, because of the dominance of the terrestrial environment by that group. Placental mammals have predominantly occupied the Northern Hemisphere, with marsupial mammals in the Southern Hemisphere.

== Approaches to classification ==

=== Taxonomic history ===

In 1811, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck defined the vertebrates as a taxonomic group, a phylum distinct from the invertebrates he was studying. He described them as consisting of four classes, namely fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals, but treated the cephalochordates and tunicates as molluscs. In 1866, Ernst Haeckel called both his &quot;Craniata&quot; (vertebrates) and his &quot;Acrania&quot; (cephalochordates) &quot;Vertebrata&quot;. In 1877, Ray Lankester grouped the Craniates, cephalochordates, and &quot;Urochordates (tunicates) as &quot;Vertebrata&quot;. In 1880–1881, Francis Maitland Balfour placed the Vertebrata as a subphylum within the Chordates. In 2018, Naoki Irie and colleagues proposed making Vertebrata a full phylum.

=== Traditional taxonomy ===

Conventional evolutionary taxonomy groups extant vertebrates into seven classes based on traditional interpretations of gross anatomical and physiological traits. The commonly held classification lists three classes of fish and four of tetrapods. This ignores some of the natural relationships between the groupings. For example, the birds derive from a group of reptiles, so &quot;Reptilia&quot; excluding &quot;Aves&quot; is not a natural grouping; it is described as paraphyletic.

* Subphylum Vertebrata
** Class Agnatha (jawless fishes, paraphyletic)
** Class Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fishes)
** Class Osteichthyes (bony fishes, paraphyletic)
** Class Amphibia (amphibians)
** Class Reptilia (reptiles, paraphyletic)
** Class Aves (birds)
** Class Mammalia (mammals)

In addition to these, there are two classes of extinct armoured fishes, Placodermi and Acanthodii, both paraphyletic.

Other ways of classifying the vertebrates have been devised, particularly with emphasis on the phylogeny of early amphibians and reptiles. An example based on work by M.J. Benton in 2004 is given here († = extinct):

* Subphylum Vertebrata
**&quot;Palaeospondylus&quot;
** Infraphylum Agnatha or Cephalaspidomorphi (lampreys and other jawless fishes)
***Superclass Anaspidomorphi (anaspids and relatives)
** Infraphylum Gnathostomata (vertebrates with jaws)
*** Class Placodermi (extinct armoured fishes)
*** Class Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fishes)
*** Class Acanthodii (extinct spiny &quot;sharks&quot;)
*** Superclass Osteichthyes (bony fishes)
**** Class Actinopterygii (ray-finned bony fishes)
**** Class Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fishes, including the tetrapods)
*** Superclass Tetrapoda (four-limbed vertebrates)
**** Class Amphibia (amphibians, some ancestral to the amniotes)—now a paraphyletic group
**** Class Synapsida (mammals and their extinct relatives)
**** Class Sauropsida (reptiles and birds)

While this traditional taxonomy is orderly, most of the groups are paraphyletic, meaning that the structure does not accurately reflect the natural evolved grouping. For instance, descendants of the first reptiles include modern reptiles, mammals and birds; the agnathans have given rise to the jawed vertebrates; the bony fishes have given rise to the land vertebrates; a group of amphibians, the labyrinthodonts, have given rise to the reptiles (traditionally including the mammal-like synapsids), which in turn have given rise to the mammals and birds. Most scientists working with vertebrates use a classification based purely on phylogeny, organized by their known evolutionary history.

=== External phylogeny ===

The closest relatives of vertebrates have been debated over the years. It was once thought that the Cephalochordata was the sister taxon to Vertebrata. This group, Notochordata, was taken to be sister to the Tunicata. Since 2006, analysis has shown that the tunicates + vertebrates form a clade, the Olfactores, with Cephalochordata as its sister (the Olfactores hypothesis), as shown in the following phylogenetic tree.

=== Internal phylogeny ===

The internal phylogeny of the vertebrates is shown in the below tree.

The placement of hagfishes within the vertebrates has been controversial. Their lack of proper vertebrae (among other characteristics of jawless lampreys and jawed vertebrates) led phylogenetic analyses based on morphology to place them outside Vertebrata. Molecular data however indicates that they are vertebrates, being most closely related to lampreys. An older view is that they are a sister group of vertebrates in the common taxon of Craniata. In 2019, Tetsuto Miyashita and colleagues reconciled the two types of analysis, supporting the Cyclostomata hypothesis using only morphological data.

== Diversity ==

=== Species by group ===

Described and extant vertebrate species are split roughly evenly but non-phylogenetically between non-tetrapod &quot;fish&quot; and tetrapods. The following table lists the number of described extant species for each vertebrate class as estimated in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, 2014.3. Paraphyletic groups are shown in quotation marks.

The IUCN estimates that 1,305,075 extant invertebrate species have been described, which means that less than 5% of the described animal species in the world are vertebrates.

=== Population trends ===

The Living Planet Index, following 16,704 populations of 4,005 species of vertebrates, shows a decline of 60% between 1970 and 2014. Since 1970, freshwater species declined 83%, and tropical populations in South and Central America declined 89%. The authors note that &quot;An average trend in population change is not an average of total numbers of animals lost.&quot; According to WWF, this could lead to a sixth major extinction event. The five main causes of biodiversity loss are land-use change, overexploitation of natural resources, climate change, pollution and invasive species.

<doc id="36857" wikidata="Q41741" url="?curid=36857" title="Thrace">
<text>Thrace (, ; ; ; ) is a geographical and historical region in Southeast Europe roughly corresponding to the Province of Thrace in the Roman Empire. Bounded by the Balkan Mountains to the north, the Aegean Sea to the south, and the Black Sea to the east, it comprises present-day southeastern Bulgaria (Northern Thrace), northeastern Greece (Western Thrace), and the European part of Turkey (East Thrace). Lands also inhabited by ancient Thracians extended in the north to modern-day Northern Bulgaria and Romania and to the west into Macedonia.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Thrace&quot;, from ancient Greek &quot;Thrake&quot; (Θρᾴκη), referred originally to the Thracians (ancient Greek &quot;Thrakes&quot; Θρᾷκες), an ancient people inhabiting Southeast Europe. The name &quot;Europe&quot; (ancient Greek Εὐρώπη), also at first referred to this region, before that term expanded to include its modern sense. 

It has been suggested that the name &quot;Thrace&quot; derives from the name of the principal river of the region, the Hebros. The river&#x27;s name may be derived from from the Indo-European &quot;arg&quot; &quot;white river&quot; (the opposite of Vardar, meaning &quot;black river&quot;). According to an alternative theory, Hebros means &quot;goat&quot; in Thracian.

Sixth century geographer Stephanus of Byzantium claimed that, long before the ancient Greeks started referring to the region as &quot;Thrace&quot;, it was known as Aria (Αρια) and Perki (Περκη).

In Turkish, Thrace is commonly referred to as &quot;Rumeli&quot;, meaning &quot;Land of the Romans&quot;, which was the name traditionally given by Turkic societies to the Byzantine Empire and Orthodox Christians.

In Greek mythology, Thrace is named after the heroine and sorceress Thrace, who was the daughter of Oceanus and Parthenope, and sister of Europa.

==Geography==
===Borders===
The historical boundaries of Thrace have varied. The ancient Greeks employed the term &quot;Thrace&quot; to refer to all of the territory which lay north of Thessaly inhabited by the Thracians, a region which &quot;had no definite boundaries&quot; and to which other regions (like Macedonia and even Scythia) were added. In one ancient Greek source, the very Earth is divided into &quot;Asia, Libya, Europa and Thracia&quot;. As the Greeks gained knowledge of world geography, &quot;Thrace&quot; came to designate the area bordered by the Danube on the north, by the Euxine Sea (Black Sea) on the east, by northern Macedonia in the south, and by Illyria to the west. This largely coincided with the Thracian Odrysian kingdom, whose borders varied over time. After the Macedonian conquest, this region&#x27;s former border with Macedonia was shifted from the Struma River to the Mesta River. This usage lasted until the Roman conquest. Henceforth, (classical) Thrace referred only to the tract of land largely covering the same extent of space as the modern geographical region. In its early period, the Roman province of Thrace was of this extent, but after the administrative reforms of the late 3rd century, Thracia&#x27;s much reduced territory became the six small provinces which constituted the Diocese of Thrace. The medieval Byzantine theme of Thrace contained only what today is East Thrace.

===Cities===

The largest cities of Thrace are: Istanbul, Plovdiv, Çorlu, Tekirdağ, Burgas, Edirne, Stara Zagora, Sliven, Yambol, Haskovo, Komotini, Alexandroupoli, Xanthi, and Kırklareli.

==Demographics and religion==
Most of the Bulgarian and Greek population are Orthodox Christians, while most of the Turkish inhabitants of Thrace are Sunni Muslims.

===Ancient Greek mythology===
Ancient Greek mythology provides the Thracians with a mythical ancestor Thrax, the son of the war-god Ares, who was said to reside in Thrace. The Thracians appear in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; as Trojan allies, led by Acamas and Peiros. Later in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Rhesus, another Thracian king, makes an appearance. Cisseus, father-in-law to the Trojan elder Antenor, is also given as a Thracian king.

Homeric Thrace was vaguely defined, and stretched from the River Axios in the west to the Hellespont and Black Sea in the east. The Catalogue of Ships mentions three separate contingents from Thrace: Thracians led by Acamas and Peiros, from Aenus; Cicones led by Euphemus, from southern Thrace, near Ismaros; and from the city of Sestus, on the Thracian (northern) side of the Hellespont, which formed part of the contingent led by Asius. Ancient Thrace was home to numerous other tribes, such as the Edones, Bisaltae, Cicones, and Bistones in addition to the tribe that Homer specifically calls the &quot;Thracians&quot;.

Greek mythology is replete with Thracian kings, including Diomedes, Tereus, Lycurgus, Phineus, Tegyrius, Eumolpus, Polymnestor, Poltys, and Oeagrus (father of Orpheus).

Thrace is mentioned in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, in the episode of Philomela, Procne, and Tereus: Tereus, the King of Thrace, lusts after his sister-in-law, Philomela. He kidnaps her, holds her captive, rapes her, and cuts out her tongue. Philomela manages to get free, however. She and her sister, Procne, plot to get revenge, by killing her son Itys (by Tereus) and serving him to his father for dinner. At the end of the myth, all three turn into birds – Procne into a swallow, Philomela into a nightingale, and Tereus into a hoopoe.

The city of Dicaea in Thrace was named after the son of Poseidon, Dicaeus.

==History==
=== Ancient and Roman history ===

Indigenous Thracians were divided into numerous tribes. The first to take greater control of Thrace, in part or whole, were the Achaemenian Persians in the late 6th century BC. The region was incorporated into their empire as the Satrapy of Skudra, after the Scythian campaign of Darius the Great. Thracian soldiers were used in Persian armies and are depicted in carvings of the Persepolis and Naqsh-e Rostam. Persians&#x27; presence in Thracia lasted for more than a century, ending with the conquests in the 4th century BC by Alexander the Great of Macedon, who divided the vast realm between his generals. Notably, Thracian troops are known to have accompanied Alexander when he crossed the Hellespont which abuts Thrace, during the invasion of the Persian Empire itself.

The Thracians recorded no collective name for themselves; terms such as &quot;Thrace&quot; and &quot;Thracians&quot; were assigned by the Greeks.

Divided into separate tribes, the Thracians did not form any lasting political organizations until the founding of the Odrysian state in the 4th century BC. Like Illyrians, the locally ruled Thracian tribes of the mountainous regions maintained a warrior tradition, while the tribes based in the plains were purportedly more peaceable. Recently discovered funeral mounds in Bulgaria suggest that Thracian kings did rule regions of Thrace with distinct Thracian national identity.

During this period, a subculture of celibate ascetics called the Ctistae lived in Thrace, where they served as philosophers, priests, and prophets.

Sections of Thrace particularly in the south started to become hellenized before the Peloponnesian War as Athenian and Ionian colonies were set up in Thrace before the war. Spartan and other Doric colonists followed them after the war. The special interest of Athens to Thrace is underlined by the numerous finds of Athenian silverware in Thracian tombs. In 168 BC, after the Third Macedonian war and the subjugation of Macedonia to the Romans, Thrace also lost its independence and became tributary to Rome. Towards the end of the 1st century BC Thrace lost its status as a client kingdom as the Romans began to directly appoint their kings. This situation lasted until 46 AD, when the Romans finally turned Thrace into a Roman province (Romana provincia Thracia).

During the Roman domination, within the geographical borders of ancient Thrace, there were two separate Roman provinces, namely Thrace (&quot;provincia Thracia&quot;) and Lower Moesia (&quot;Moesia inferior&quot;). Later, in the times of Diocletian, the two provinces were joined and formed the so-called &quot;Dioecesis Thracia&quot;. The establishment of Roman colonies and mostly several Greek cities, as was Nicopolis, Topeiros, Traianoupolis, Plotinoupolis, and Hadrianoupolis resulted from the Roman Empire&#x27;s urbanization. The Roman provincial policy in Thrace favored mainly not the Romanization but the Hellenization of the country, which had started as early as the Archaic period through the Greek colonisation and was completed by the end of Roman antiquity. As regards the competition between the Greek and Latin language, the very high rate of Greek inscriptions in Thrace extending south of Haemus Mountains proves the complete language Hellenization of this region. The boundaries between the Greek and Latin speaking Thrace are placed just above the northern foothills of Haemus Mountains.

During the imperial period many Thracians – particularly members of the local aristocracy of the cities – had been granted the right of the Roman citizenship (civitas Romana) with all its privileges. Epigraphic evidence show a large increase in such naturalizations in the times of Trajan and Hadrian, while in 212 AD the emperor Caracalla granted, with his well-known decree (constitutio Antoniniana), the Roman citizenship to all the free inhabitants of the Roman Empire.
During the same period (in the 1st–2nd century AD), a remarkable presence of Thracians is testified by the inscriptions outside the borders (extra fines) both in the Greek territory and in all the Roman provinces, especially in the provinces of Eastern Roman Empire.

===Medieval history===

By the mid-5th century, as the Western Roman Empire began to crumble, Thracia fell from the authority of Rome and into the hands of Germanic tribal rulers. With the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Thracia turned into a battleground territory for the better part of the next 1,000 years. The surviving eastern portion of the Roman Empire in the Balkans, later known as the Byzantine Empire, retained control over Thrace until the 7th century when the northern half of the entire region was incorporated into the First Bulgarian Empire and the remainder was reorganized in the Thracian theme. The Empire regained the lost regions in the late 10th century until the Bulgarians regained control of the northern half at the end of the 12th century. Throughout the 13th century and the first half of the 14th century, the region was changing in the hands of the Bulgarian and the Byzantine Empire (excluding Constantinople). In 1265 the area suffered a Mongol raid from the Golden Horde, led by Nogai Khan, and between 1305 and 1307 was raided by the Catalan company.

===Ottoman period===

In 1352, the Ottoman Turks conducted their first incursion into the region subduing it completely within a matter of two decades and ruled it for five centuries in general peace. In 1821, several parts of Thrace, such as Lavara, Maroneia, Sozopolis, Aenos, Callipolis, and Samothraki rebelled during the Greek War of Independence.

===Modern history===

With the Congress of Berlin in 1878, Northern Thrace was incorporated into the semi-autonomous Ottoman province of Eastern Rumelia, which united with Bulgaria in 1885. The rest of Thrace was divided among Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece at the beginning of the 20th century, following the Balkan Wars, World War I and the Greco-Turkish War. In Summer 1934, up to 10,000 Jews were maltreated, bereaved, and then forced to quit the region (see 1934 Thrace pogroms). From Bulgaria and Romania between 1934 and 1938 a large wave of Muslims immigrants called &quot;Göçmenler&quot; went to East Thrace.

Today, &quot;Thracian&quot; is a geographical term used in Bulgaria, Turkey, and Greece.

==Notable Thracians==
*Orpheus was, in Ancient Greek mythology, the chief representative of the art of song and playing the lyre.
*Protagoras (c. 490–420 BC) was a Greek philosopher from Abdera, Thrace. An expert in rhetorics and subjects connected to virtue and political life, often regarded as the first sophist. He is known primarily for three claims: (1) that man is the measure of all things, often interpreted as a sort of moral relativism, (2) that he could make the &quot;worse (or weaker) argument appear the better (or stronger)&quot; (see Sophism), and (3) that one could not tell if the gods existed or not (see Agnosticism).
*Herodicus was a Greek physician of the fifth century BC who is considered the founder of sports medicine. He is believed to have been one of Hippocrates&#x27;s tutors.
*Democritus (c. 460–370 BC) was a Greek philosopher and mathematician from Abdera, Thrace. His main contribution is the atomic theory, the belief that all matter is made up of various imperishable indivisible elements which he called atoms.
*Spartacus was a Thracian who led a large slave uprising in what is now Italy in 73–71 BC. His army of escaped gladiators and slaves defeated several Roman legions in what is known as the Third Servile War.
*A number of Roman emperors of the 3rd–5th century were of Thraco-Roman backgrounds (Maximinus Thrax, Licinius, Galerius, Aureolus, Leo the Thracian, etc.). These emperors were elevated via a military career (hence the resultant nickname for them, Barracks Emperor), from the condition of common soldiers in one of the Roman legions to the foremost positions of political power.

==Legacy==
The Trakiya Heights in Antarctica &quot;are named after the historical region.&quot;
