<text>William II (; – 2 August 1100) was King of England from 26 September 1087 until his death in 1100, with powers over Normandy and influence in Scotland. He was less successful in extending control into Wales. The third son of William the Conqueror, he is commonly referred to as William Rufus (&quot;&quot; being Latin for &quot;the Red&quot;), perhaps because of his ruddy appearance or, more likely, due to having red hair.

William was a figure of complex temperament, capable of both bellicosity and flamboyance. He did not marry or have children, which – along with contemporary accounts – has led some historians to speculate on homosexuality or bisexuality. He died after being hit by an arrow while hunting. Circumstantial evidence in the behaviour of those around him – including his younger brother Henry I – raises strong, but unproven, suspicions of murder. Henry immediately seized the treasury and had himself crowned king.

Historian Frank Barlow observed William was &quot;[a] rumbustious, devil-may-care soldier, without natural dignity or social graces, with no cultivated tastes and little show of conventional religious piety or morality – indeed, according to his critics, addicted to every kind of vice, particularly lust and especially sodomy.&quot; On the other hand, he was a wise ruler and victorious general. Barlow noted, &quot;His chivalrous virtues and achievements were all too obvious. He had maintained good order and satisfactory justice in England and restored good peace to Normandy. He had extended Anglo-Norman rule in Wales, brought Scotland firmly under his lordship, recovered Maine, and kept up the pressure on the Vexin.&quot;

== Early years ==
William&#x27;s exact date of birth is not known, but according to Frank Barlow it occurred by 1060. He was the third of four sons born to William the Conqueror and Matilda of Flanders, the eldest being Robert Curthose, the second Richard, and the youngest Henry. Richard died around 1075 while hunting in the New Forest. William succeeded to the throne of England on his father&#x27;s death in 1087, but Robert inherited Normandy.

William had five or six sisters. The existence of sisters Adeliza and Matilda is not absolutely certain, but four sisters are more securely attested:
* Adela, who married Stephen, Count of Blois;
* Cecily, who became a nun;
* Agatha, who died unmarried;
* Constance, who married Alan IV, Duke of Brittany.

Records indicate strained relations between the three surviving sons of William I. William&#x27;s contemporary, chronicler Orderic Vitalis, wrote about an incident that took place at L&#x27;Aigle in Normandy in 1077 or 1078: William and Henry, having grown bored with casting dice, decided to make mischief by emptying a chamber pot onto their brother Robert from an upper gallery, thus infuriating and shaming him. A brawl broke out, and their father had to intercede to restore order.

According to William of Malmesbury, writing in the 12th century, William Rufus was &quot;well set; his complexion florid, his hair yellow; of open countenance; different coloured eyes, varying with certain glittering specks; of astonishing strength, though not very tall, and his belly rather projecting.&quot;

== England and France ==

The division of William the Conqueror&#x27;s lands into two parts upon his death presented a dilemma for those nobles who held land on both sides of the English Channel. Since the younger William and his brother Robert were natural rivals, these nobles worried that they could not hope to please both of their lords, and thus ran the risk of losing the favour of one ruler or the other, or both. The only solution, as they saw it, was to unite England and Normandy once more under one ruler. The pursuit of this aim led them to revolt against William in favour of Robert in the Rebellion of 1088, under the leadership of the powerful Bishop Odo of Bayeux, who was a half-brother of William the Conqueror. As Robert failed to appear in England to rally his supporters, William won the support of the English with silver and promises of better government, and defeated the rebellion, thus securing his authority. In 1091 he invaded Normandy, crushing Robert&#x27;s forces and forcing him to cede a portion of his lands. The two made up their differences and William agreed to help Robert recover lands lost to France, notably Maine. This plan was later abandoned, but William continued to pursue a ferociously warlike defence of his French possessions and interests to the end of his life, exemplified by his response to the attempt by Elias de la Flèche, Count of Maine, to take Le Mans in 1099.

William Rufus was thus secure in his kingdom. As in Normandy, his bishops and abbots were bound to him by feudal obligations, and his right of investiture in the Norman tradition prevailed within his kingdom during the age of the Investiture Controversy that brought excommunication upon the Salian Emperor Henry IV. The king&#x27;s personal power, through an effective and loyal chancery, penetrated to the local level to an extent unmatched in France. The king&#x27;s administration and law unified the realm, rendering him relatively impervious to papal condemnation. In 1097 he commenced the original Westminster Hall, built &quot;to impress his subjects with the power and majesty of his authority&quot;.

== Religion ==
Less than two years after becoming king, William II lost his father&#x27;s adviser and confidant, the Italian-Norman Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury. After Lanfranc&#x27;s death in 1089, the king delayed appointing a new archbishop for many years, appropriating ecclesiastical revenues in the interim. In panic, owing to serious illness in 1093, William nominated as archbishop another Norman-Italian, Anselm – considered the greatest theologian of his generation – but this led to a long period of animosity between Church and State, Anselm being a stronger supporter of the Gregorian reforms in the Church than Lanfranc. William and Anselm disagreed on a range of ecclesiastical issues, in the course of which the king declared of Anselm that, &quot;Yesterday I hated him with great hatred, today I hate him with yet greater hatred and he can be certain that tomorrow and thereafter I shall hate him continually with ever fiercer and more bitter hatred.&quot; The English clergy, beholden to the king for their preferments and livings, were unable to support Anselm publicly. In 1095 William called a council at Rockingham to bring Anselm to heel, but the archbishop remained firm. In October 1097, Anselm went into exile, taking his case to the Pope. The diplomatic and flexible Urban II, a new pope, was involved in a major conflict with Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV, who supported Antipope Clement III. Reluctant to make another enemy, Urban came to a concordat with William, whereby William recognised Urban as pope, and Urban gave sanction to the Anglo-Norman ecclesiastical &quot;status quo&quot;. Anselm remained in exile, and William was able to claim the revenues of the archbishop of Canterbury to the end of his reign.

However, this conflict was symptomatic of medieval English politics, as exemplified by the murder of Thomas Becket during the reign of the later Plantagenet king Henry II (his great-nephew through his brother Henry) and Henry VIII&#x27;s actions centuries later, and as such should not be seen as a defect of William&#x27;s reign in particular. Of course, contemporary churchmen were themselves not above engaging in such politics: it is reported that, when Archbishop Lanfranc suggested to William I that he imprison the rebellious bishop Odo of Bayeux, he exclaimed &quot;What! He is a clergyman.&quot; Lanfranc retorted that &quot;You will not seize the bishop of Bayeux, but confine the earl of Kent.&quot; (Odo held both titles.)

While there are complaints of contemporaries regarding William&#x27;s personal behaviour, he was instrumental in assisting the foundation of Bermondsey Abbey, endowing it with the manor of Bermondsey, and it is reported that his &quot;customary oath&quot; was &quot;By the Face at Lucca!&quot;

== War and rebellion ==
William Rufus inherited the Anglo-Norman settlement detailed in the Domesday Book of 1086, a survey undertaken at his father&#x27;s command, essentially for the purposes of taxation, which was an example of the control of the English monarchy. If he was less effective than his father in containing the Norman lords&#x27; propensity for rebellion and violence, through charisma or political skills, he was forceful in overcoming the consequences. In 1095, Robert de Mowbray, the earl of Northumbria, refused to attend the &quot;Curia Regis&quot;, the thrice-annual court where the King announced his governmental decisions to the great lords. William led an army against Robert and defeated him. Robert was dispossessed and imprisoned, and another noble, William of Eu, accused of treachery, was blinded and castrated.

In external affairs, William had some successes. In 1091 he repulsed an invasion by King Malcolm III of Scotland, forcing Malcolm to pay homage. In 1092 he built Carlisle Castle, taking control of Cumberland and Westmorland, which had previously been claimed by the Scots. Subsequently, the two kings quarrelled over Malcolm&#x27;s possessions in England, and Malcolm again invaded, ravaging Northumbria. At the Battle of Alnwick, on 13 November 1093, Malcolm was ambushed by Norman forces led by Robert de Mowbray. Malcolm and his son Edward were killed and Malcolm&#x27;s brother Donald seized the Scottish throne. William supported Malcolm&#x27;s son Duncan II, who held power for a short time, and then another of Malcolm&#x27;s sons, Edgar. Edgar conquered Lothian in 1094 and eventually removed Donald in 1097 with William&#x27;s aid in a campaign led by Edgar Ætheling. The new king recognised William&#x27;s authority over Lothian and attended William&#x27;s court.

William made two forays into Wales in 1097. Nothing decisive was achieved, but a series of castles were constructed as a marchland defensive barrier.

In 1096, William&#x27;s brother Robert Curthose joined the First Crusade. He needed money to fund this venture and pledged his Duchy of Normandy to William in return for a payment of 10,000 marks, which equates to about a quarter of William&#x27;s annual revenue. In a display of the effectiveness of English taxation, William raised the money by levying a special, heavy, and much-resented tax upon the whole of England. He then ruled Normandy as regent in Robert&#x27;s absence. Robert did not return until September 1100, one month after William&#x27;s death.

As regent in Normandy, William campaigned in France from 1097 to 1099. He secured northern Maine but failed to seize the French-controlled part of the Vexin region. According to William of Malmesbury he was planning to invade the Duchy of Aquitaine at the time of his death.

== Death ==
William went hunting on 2 August 1100 in the New Forest, probably near Brockenhurst, and was killed by an arrow through the lung, although the circumstances remain unclear. The earliest statement of the event was in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, which noted that the king was &quot;shot by an arrow by one of his own men.&quot; Later chroniclers added the name of the killer, a nobleman named Walter Tirel, although the description of events was later embroidered with other details that may or may not be true. The first mention of any location more exact than the New Forest comes from John Leland, who wrote in 1530 that William died at Thorougham, a placename that is no longer used, but that probably referred to a location on what is now Park Farm on the Beaulieu estates. A memorial stone in the grounds of Beaulieu Abbey, Hampshire, states &quot;Remember King William Rufus who died in these parts then known as Truham whilst hunting on 2nd August 1100&quot;.

The king&#x27;s body was abandoned by the nobles at the place where he fell. An arrow maker, Eli Parratt, later found the body. William&#x27;s younger brother, Henry, hastened to Winchester to secure the royal treasury (initially defended by the Norman St William of Breteuil in deference to the claims of Duke Robert), then to London, where he was crowned within days before either archbishop could arrive. William of Malmesbury, in his account of William&#x27;s death, stated that the body was taken to Winchester Cathedral by a few countrymen, including Eli who discovered the body.

To the chroniclers, men of the Church, such an &quot;act of God&quot; was a just end for a wicked king, and was regarded as a fitting demise for a ruler who came into conflict with the religious orders to which they belonged. Over the following centuries, the obvious suggestion that one of William&#x27;s enemies had a hand in this event has repeatedly been made: chroniclers of the time point out themselves that Tirel was renowned as a keen bowman, and thus was unlikely to have loosed such an impetuous shot. Moreover, Bartlett says that rivalry between brothers was the pattern of political conflict in this period. William&#x27;s brother Henry was among the hunting party that day and succeeded him as king.

Modern scholars have reopened the question, and some have found the assassination theory credible or compelling, but the theory is not universally accepted. Barlow says that accidents were common and there is not enough hard evidence to prove murder. Bartlett notes that hunting was dangerous. Poole says the facts &quot;look ugly&quot; and &quot;seem to suggest a plot.&quot; John Gillingham points out that if Henry had planned to murder William it would have been in his interest to wait until a later time. It looked as though there would soon be a war between William and his brother Robert, which would result in one of them being eliminated, thus opening the way for Henry to acquire both England and Normandy through a single assassination. Tirel fled immediately. Henry had the most to gain by his brother&#x27;s death. Indeed, Henry&#x27;s actions &quot;seem to be premeditated: wholly disregarding his dead brother, he rode straight for Winchester, seized the treasury (always the first act of a usurping king), and the next day had himself elected.&quot;

William&#x27;s remains are in Winchester Cathedral. The tomb long thought to be his is now thought to belong to William&#x27;s nephew, Henry of Blois. Presently, his remains are scattered among royal mortuary chests positioned on the presbytery screen, flanking the choir. His skull appears to be missing, but some long bones may remain.

== Rufus Stone ==
A stone known as the &quot;Rufus Stone&quot;, close to the A31 near the village of Minstead (), is claimed to mark the spot where William fell. The claim that this is the location of his death appears to date from no earlier than a 17th century visit by Charles II to the forest. At the time the most popular account of William&#x27;s death involved the fatal arrow deflecting off a tree, and Charles appears to have been shown a suitable tree. Letters in &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; reported that the tree was cut down and burned during the 18th century. Later in that century the Rufus Stone was set up. Originally it was around tall with a stone ball on top. King George III visited the stone in 1789, along with Queen Charlotte, and an inscription was added to the stone to commemorate the visit. It was protected with a cast iron cover in 1841 after repeated vandalism.

The inscription on the Rufus Stone reads:
Here stood the Oak Tree, on which an arrow shot by Sir Walter Tyrrell at a Stag, glanced and struck King William the Second, surnamed Rufus, on the breast, of which he instantly died, on the second day of August, anno 1100.

That the spot where an Event so Memorable might not hereafter be forgotten; the enclosed stone was set up by John Lord Delaware who had seen the Tree growing in this place. This Stone having been much mutilated, and the inscriptions on each of its three sides defaced, this more Durable Memorial, with the original inscriptions, was erected in the year 1841, by Wm [William] Sturges Bourne Warden.

King William the Second, surnamed Rufus being slain, as before related, was laid in a cart, belonging to one Purkis, and drawn from hence, to Winchester, and buried in the Cathedral Church, of that City.

== Contemporary assessment ==
William was an effective soldier, but he was a ruthless ruler and, it seems, was little liked by those he governed. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, he was &quot;hated by almost all his people and abhorrent to God.&quot; Chroniclers tended to take a dim view of William&#x27;s reign, arguably on account of his long and difficult struggles with the Church: these chroniclers were themselves generally clerics, and so might be expected to report him somewhat negatively. His chief minister was Ranulf Flambard, whom he appointed Bishop of Durham in 1099: this was a political appointment, to a see that was also a great fiefdom. The particulars of the king&#x27;s relationship with the people of England are not credibly documented. Contemporaries of William, as well as those writing after his death, roundly denounced him for presiding over what these dissenters considered a dissolute court. In keeping with the tradition of Norman leaders, William scorned the English and the English culture.

== Sexuality ==
Contemporaries of William raised concerns about a court dominated by homosexuality and effeminacy, epitomised through seemingly &quot;luxurious&quot; attire and unusual footwear than with sexual practices.

Citing the traditions of Wilton Abbey in the 1140s, Herman of Tournai wrote that the abbess had ordered the Scottish princess Edith (later Matilda, wife of Henry I) to become a nun in order to protect her from the lust of William Rufus, which angered Edith&#x27;s father because of the effect it might have on her prospects of marriage.

The historian Emma Mason has noted that while during his reign William himself was never openly accused of homosexuality, in the decades after his death numerous medieval writers spoke of this and a few began to describe him as a &quot;sodomite&quot;. Modern historians cannot state with certainty whether William was homosexual or not; however, he never took a wife or a mistress, or fathered any children. As a bachelor king without an heir, William would have been pressed to take a wife and would have had numerous proposals for marriage. That he never accepted any of these proposals nor had any relations with women may show that he either had no desire for women, or he may have taken a vow of chastity or celibacy.

Barlow said that the Welsh chronicles claim that Henry was able to succeed to the throne because his brother had made use of concubines and thus died childless, although no illegitimate offspring are named. Barlow also allows that William may have been sterile. Noting that no &quot;favourites&quot; were identified, and that William&#x27;s &quot;baronial friends and companions were mostly married men&quot;, despite having concluded that the chroniclers were &quot;hostile and biased witnesses&quot;, Barlow considers that &quot;there seems no reason why they should have invented this particular charge&quot; (of homosexuality) and states that, in his opinion, &quot;On the whole the evidence points to the king&#x27;s bisexuality&quot;.

<text>West Bromwich Albion Football Club (), commonly known as West Brom or The Albion, is a professional association football club based in West Bromwich, West Midlands, England. They compete in the EFL Championship, the second level of the English football league. The club was formed in 1878 and has played at its home ground, The Hawthorns, since 1900.

Albion were a founder member of the Football League in 1888, the first professional football league in the world. The club has spent the majority of its existence in the top tier of English football, where it has played for 82 seasons, most recently competing in the Premier League in 2021. They have been champions of England once, in 1919–20, and have been runner-up twice, in 1924–25 and 1953–54. Albion have reached ten FA Cup finals and won the Cup on five occasions. The first win came in 1888, the year the league was founded, followed by wins in 1892, 1931, 1954 and most recently in 1968, the club&#x27;s last major trophy. Albion also won the Football League Cup at the first attempt in 1966, and have reached a further two finals. The club&#x27;s longest continuous period in the top division spanned 24 years between 1949 and 1973, and from 1986 to 2002 it had its longest spell out of the top division.

The team have played in navy blue and white stripes for most of the club&#x27;s history, and the club badge features a throstle perched on a hawthorn branch. Albion have long-standing rivalries with their traditional local rivals Aston Villa and Wolverhampton Wanderers. Albion contest the Black Country derby with the latter.

==History==


===Early years (1878–1950)===

The club was founded as West Bromwich Strollers in 1878 by workers from George Salter&#x27;s Spring Works in West Bromwich, in the Black Country. They were renamed West Bromwich Albion in 1880, becoming the first team to adopt the &quot;Albion&quot; suffix; Albion was a district of West Bromwich where some of the players lived or worked, close to what is today Greets Green. The club joined the Birmingham &amp; District Football Association in 1881 and became eligible for their first competition, the Birmingham Cup. They reached the quarter-finals, beating several longer-established clubs on the way. In 1883, Albion won their first trophy, the Staffordshire Cup. Albion joined the Football Association in the same year; this enabled them to enter the FA Cup for the first time in the 1883–84 season. In 1885 the club turned professional, and in 1886 the team reached the FA Cup final for the first time, losing 2–0 to Blackburn Rovers in a replay. They reached the final again in 1887, but lost 2–0 to Aston Villa. In 1888 the team won the trophy for the first time, beating strong favourites Preston North End 2–1 in the final. As FA Cup winners, they qualified to play in a Football World Championship game against Scottish Cup winners Renton, which ended in a 4–1 defeat.

In March 1888, William McGregor wrote to what he considered to be the top five English teams, including Albion, informing them of his intention to form an association of clubs that would play each other home and away each season. Thus when the Football League started later that year, Albion became one of the twelve founder members. Albion&#x27;s second FA Cup success came in 1892, beating Aston Villa 3–0. They met Villa again in the 1895 final, but lost 1–0. The team suffered relegation to Division Two in 1900–01, their first season at The Hawthorns. They were promoted as champions the following season but relegated again in 1903–04. The club won the Division Two championship once more in 1910–11, and the following season reached another FA Cup Final, where they were defeated by Second Division Barnsley in a replay.

Albion won the Football League title in 1919–20 for the only time in their history following the end of World War I, their totals of 104 goals and 60 points both breaking the previous league records. The team finished as Division One runners-up in 1924–25, narrowly losing out to Huddersfield Town, but were relegated in 1926–27. In 1930–31, they won promotion as well as the FA Cup, beating Birmingham 2–1 in the final. The &quot;double&quot; of winning the FA Cup and promotion has not been achieved before or since. Albion reached the final again in 1935, losing to Sheffield Wednesday, but were relegated three years later. They gained promotion in 1948–49, and there followed the club&#x27;s longest unbroken spell in the top flight of English football, a total of 24 years.

===Success and decline (1950–1992)===

In 1953–54, Albion came close to being the first team in the 20th century to win the League and Cup double. They succeeded in winning the FA Cup, beating Preston North End 3–2, but injuries and a loss of form towards the end of the season meant that they finished as runners-up to fierce rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers in the league. Nonetheless, Albion became known for their brand of fluent, attacking football, with the 1953–54 side being hailed as the &quot;Team of the Century&quot;. One national newspaper went so far as to suggest that the team be chosen &quot;en masse&quot; to represent England at the 1954 FIFA World Cup finals. They remained one of the top English sides for the remainder of the decade, reaching the semi-final of the 1957 FA Cup and achieving three consecutive top five finishes in Division One between 1957–58 and 1959–60.

Although their league form was less impressive during the 1960s, the second half of the decade saw West Brom establish a reputation as a successful cup side. Albion entered the Football League Cup for the first time in 1965–66 and, under manager Jimmy Hagan, won the final by defeating West Ham United 5–3 on aggregate. That was the last two-legged final and, the following year, Albion reached the final again, the first played at Wembley. They lost 3–2 to Third Division Queens Park Rangers after being 2–0 up at half-time. Albion&#x27;s cup form continued under Hagan&#x27;s successor Alan Ashman. He guided the club to their last major trophy to date, the 1968 FA Cup, when they beat Everton in extra time thanks to a single goal from Jeff Astle. Albion reached the FA Cup semi-final and European Cup Winners Cup quarter-final in 1969, and were defeated 2–1 by Manchester City in the 1970 League Cup Final. 

The club were less successful during the reign of Don Howe, and were relegated to Division Two at the end of 1972–73, but gained promotion three years later under the guidance of player-manager Johnny Giles. Under Ron Atkinson, Albion reached the 1978 FA Cup semi-final but lost to Ipswich Town. In May of that year, Albion became the first English professional team to play in China, going unbeaten on their five-game trip. In 1978–79, the team finished third in Division One, their highest placing for over 20 years, and also reached the UEFA Cup quarter-final, where they were defeated by Red Star Belgrade. The team around this time was notable for simultaneously fielding three black players: Cyrille Regis, Laurie Cunningham and Brendon Batson; and is considered to be an integral part of the acceptance of black footballers in the English leagues. In his second spell as manager, Ronnie Allen guided the team to both domestic cup semi-finals in 1981–82. The mid-1980s saw the start of Albion&#x27;s longest and deepest decline. They were relegated in 1985–86 with the worst record in the club&#x27;s history, beginning a period of 16 years outside the top flight. Five years later, the club were relegated to the Third Division for the first and only time.

===Recent years (1992–present)===

Albion had spent the majority of their history in the top-flight of English football, but when the Premier League was founded in 1992 the club found themselves in the third tier, which had been renamed Division Two. In 1992–93, Albion finished fourth and entered the play-offs for the first time. Albion&#x27;s first appearance at Wembley for over 20 years – and their last at the original stadium – saw them beat Port Vale 3–0 to return to the second level – now renamed the First Division. Manager Ossie Ardiles then joined Tottenham Hotspur, however, and a succession of managers over the next few seasons saw Albion consolidate their Division One status without mounting a serious promotion challenge.

The appointment of Gary Megson in March 2000 heralded an upturn in the club&#x27;s fortunes. Megson guided Albion to Division One safety in 1999–2000, and to the play-offs a year later. He went on to lead the club to promotion to the Premier League in 2001–02. After being relegated in their first Premier League season, they made an immediate return to the top flight in 2003–04. In 2004–05, Megson&#x27;s successor, former Albion midfielder Bryan Robson, led the team to a last-day &quot;Great Escape&quot;, when Albion became the first Premier League club to avoid relegation having been bottom of the table at Christmas, as well as bottom on the final day of the season. They failed to avoid the drop the following season, and Robson was replaced by Tony Mowbray in October 2006. The club competed in the Championship play-off final at Wembley Stadium on 28 May 2007, but lost 1–0 to Derby County. The following season, Mowbray led the Baggies to Wembley again, this time in the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where they lost 1–0 to Portsmouth. One month later, Albion were promoted to the Premier League as winners of the Championship, but were relegated at the end of the 2008–09 campaign. Mowbray left the club and was replaced by Roberto Di Matteo, who led the club back to the Premier League at the first attempt, but was dismissed in February 2011 and replaced by Roy Hodgson.

Hodgson guided Albion to an 11th-place finish for the 2010–11 season. Then followed an eight-season continuous run in the Premier League. It included an 8th-place finish in 2012–13 under Steve Clarke, and 10th-place finishes under Roy Hodgson in 2011–12 and Tony Pulis in 2016–17. In August 2016, it was announced that long-term owner Jeremy Peace had sold the club to a Chinese investment group headed up by Lai Guochuan. By this time, the club had begun to fall into a state of torpor, and were relegated at the end of the 2017–18 season, ending their eight-year Premier League stay. Pulis and his replacement Alan Pardew were both dismissed during the season. Albion finished fourth in their first season back in the Championship under the management of Darren Moore, losing the Championship play-off semi-final on penalties. 

Slaven Bilić took over as manager in June 2019, and led Albion to automatic promotion back to the Premier League during the 2019–20 season. Back in the Premier League, Bilić was controversially sacked on 16 December 2020, with Sam Allardyce named as his replacement the same day. After Albion were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 2020–21 season, Allardyce resigned from his position. The club endured disappointing results back in the Championship during the tenures of Valérien Ismaël and Steve Bruce, who left the club in the relegation places in the 2022–23 season. Carlos Corberán was named as successor on 25 October 2022. He guided Albion to a 5th-place finish and the play-off semi-finals at the end of the 2023–24 season.

In February 2024, the English Football League approved a takeover of the club by American entrepreneur Shilen Patel.

==Crest and colours==

===Badge===

Albion&#x27;s main club badge dates back to the late 1880s, when club secretary Tom Smith suggested that a throstle (song thrush) sitting on a crossbar be adopted for the badge. The badge has been subject to various revisions since then. It has always featured a throstle, usually on a blue and white striped shield, although the crossbar was replaced with a hawthorn branch at some point after the club&#x27;s move to the Hawthorns. The throstle was chosen because the public house in which the team used to change kept a pet thrush in a cage. It also gave rise to Albion&#x27;s early nickname, &quot;the Throstles&quot;. The hawthorn bush is also a favourite bush of throstles, which were regularly seen on the pre-stadium estate and local area. As late as the 1930s, a caged throstle was placed beside the touchline during matches and it was said that it only used to sing if Albion were winning. In 1979, an effigy of a throstle was erected above the half-time scoreboard of the Woodman corner at the Hawthorns, and was returned to the same area of the ground following redevelopment in the early 2000s.

In 1975, a version of the badge (on a roundel rather than a shield) was granted by the College of Arms to the Football League for licensing to the club. The badge was described in heraldic blazon as, &quot;On a roundel paly of thirteen argent and azure a mistle thrush perched on a raspberry branch leaved and fructed proper.&quot; This is the only known occasion on which the branch has been described as a raspberry branch rather than a hawthorn branch: Rodney Dennys, the officer of arms responsible, may have been imperfectly briefed.

The badge was re-designed in 2006, incorporating the name of the club for the first time. The new design aimed to safeguard and consolidate the club&#x27;s identity. Prior to this, the main club badge rarely coincided with that worn on the first team strip. No badge appeared on the kit for most of the club&#x27;s history, although the Stafford knot featured on the team jerseys for part of the 1880s. The West Bromwich town arms were worn on the players&#x27; shirts for the 1931, 1935 and 1954 FA Cup finals. The town&#x27;s Latin motto, &quot;Labor omnia vincit&quot;, translates as &quot;labour conquers all things&quot; or &quot;work conquers all&quot;. The town arms were revived as the shirt badge from 1994 until 2000, with the throstle moved to the collar of the shirts.

Albion&#x27;s first regular shirt badge appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s where it was blue. Although it featured the throstle, it did not include the blue and white striped shield of the club badge. A similar design was also used during the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the mid-1970s, a more abstract version of the throstle was used on the club&#x27;s shirts, while in the late 1970s through to the mid-1980s, an embroidered WBA logo was displayed, a common abbreviation of the club&#x27;s name in print. Not until the early 21st century did the full club badge appear on the team&#x27;s shirts.

===Colours===

West Brom have played in navy blue and white striped shirts for the majority of their existence, usually with white shorts and white socks. The team is occasionally referred to as &quot;the Stripes&quot; by supporters. A number of different colours were trialled during the club&#x27;s formative years however, including cardinal red and blue quarters in 1880–81, yellow and white quarters in 1881–82, chocolate and blue halves in 1881–82 and 1882–83, red and white hoops in 1882–83, chocolate and white in 1883–84 and cardinal red and blue halves in 1884–85. The blue and white stripes made their first appearance in the 1885–86 season, although at that time they were of a lighter shade of blue; the navy blue stripes did not appear until after the First World War. For the regional leagues played during the Second World War, Albion were forced to switch to all-blue shirts, as rationing meant that striped material was considered a luxury.

Like all football clubs, Albion sport a secondary or &quot;change&quot; strip when playing away from home against a team whose colours clash with their own. As long ago as the 1890s, and throughout much of the club&#x27;s early history, a change strip of white jerseys with black shorts was worn. The away shirt additionally featured a large &#x27;V&#x27; during the First World War. In the 1935 FA Cup Final, however, when both of Albion and Sheffield Wednesday&#x27;s kits clashed, a switch was made to plain navy blue shirts. An all-red strip was adopted at the end of the 1950s, but was dropped following defeat in the 1967 League Cup Final, to be replaced by the all-white design that was worn during the club&#x27;s FA Cup run of 1967–68. Since then the away strip has changed regularly, with yellow and green stripes the most common of a number of different designs used. In the 1990s and 2000s a third kit has occasionally been introduced.

Albion players – along with those of other Football League teams – first wore numbers on the back of their shirts in the abandoned season of 1939–40, and names on the back of their shirts from 1999–2000. Red numbers were added to the side of Albion players&#x27; shorts in 1969.

====Kit sponsors====
BSR Housewares became the club&#x27;s first shirt sponsor during the 1981–82 season. The club&#x27;s shirts have been sponsored for the majority of the time since then, although there was no shirt sponsor at the end of the 1993–94 season, after local solicitors Coucher &amp; Shaw were closed down by the Law Society of England and Wales. Unusually for a Premier League club, Albion were again without a shirt sponsor for the start of the 2008–09 campaign, as negotiations with a new sponsor were still ongoing when the season began. The longest-running shirt sponsorship deal agreed by the club ran for seven seasons between 1997 and 2004 with the West Bromwich Building Society. Today the club&#x27;s principal sponsor is Ideal Heating.

Since June 2024, West Brom&#x27;s kit has been manufactured by Macron. Previous manufacturers have included Scoreline, Influence, Pelada, Patrick, Diadora, Umbro, Adidas and Puma.
==Stadium==
The speed with which the club became established following its foundation is illustrated by the fact that it outgrew four successive grounds in its first seven years. The first was Cooper&#x27;s Hill, where they played from 1878 to 1879. From 1879 to 1881, they appear to have alternated between Cooper&#x27;s Hill and Dartmouth Park. During the 1881–82 season, they played at Bunn&#x27;s Field, also known as the Birches. This had a capacity of between 1,500 and 2,000, and was Albion&#x27;s first enclosed ground, allowing the club to charge an entrance fee for the first time. From 1882 to 1885, as the popularity of football increased, Albion rented the Four Acres ground from the well-established West Bromwich Dartmouth Cricket Club. But they quickly outgrew this new home and soon needed to move again. From 1885 to 1900, Albion played at Stoney Lane; their tenure of this ground was arguably the most successful period in the club&#x27;s history, as they won the FA Cup twice and were runners-up three times.
By 1900, when the lease on Stoney Lane expired, the club needed a bigger ground yet again and so made its last move to date. All of Albion&#x27;s previous grounds had been close to the centre of West Bromwich, but on this occasion they took up a site on the town&#x27;s border with Handsworth and Smethwick. The new ground was named The Hawthorns, after the hawthorn bushes that covered the area and were cleared to make way for it. Albion drew 1–1 with Derby County in the first match at the stadium, on 3 September 1900. The record attendance at the Hawthorns was on 6 March 1937, when 64,815 spectators saw Albion beat Arsenal 3–1 in the FA Cup quarter-final. The Hawthorns became an all-seater stadium in the 1990s, in order to comply with the recommendations of the Taylor Report. Its capacity today is 26,688, the four stands being known respectively as the Birmingham Road End, Smethwick End, East Stand and West Stand (Halfords Lane). At an altitude of 551 feet (168 m) above sea level, the Hawthorns is the highest of all the 92 Premier League and Football League grounds.
The Hawthorns is certificated under the highest UEFA pitch surfaces which means it is ready to host almost any competition if required. The stadium&#x27;s West Stand has the potential to be developed over the Halfords Lane at the back of the stand to allow for an upper tier, bringing the capacity of The Hawthorns to around 30,000.

West Bromwich Albion own retail outlets around The Hawthorns, including its Stadium Megastore and seasonally a club store in West Bromwich town centre. They also own the former Hawthorns Pub, a Grade II listed building behind the West Stand on the corner of Halfords Lane and the Birmingham Road. This has served as the official club fanzone with licensed bars, live music, fan favourites – such as mascots and children activities – as well as being shared with a high street food outlet. The pub competes with The Vine pub in Roebuck Lane, a popular destination for visiting and home football fans year-round.
==Supporters==
===Fan culture===

The official West Bromwich Albion Supporters Club was founded on 4 October 1951. In the years since then, over 30 branches have been established throughout the United Kingdom, and internationally in Jersey, Ireland, Spain, Malta, Croatia, USA, UAE, India, Thailand and Australia. There are also supporters groups for those with disabilities, for mental health support, Punjabi supporters, supporters in the emergency services and armed forces, and LGBT people.

Albion&#x27;s &quot;club anthem&quot; is &quot;The Lord&#x27;s my Shepherd&quot;, a setting of Psalm 23. The song originated following a rare Sunday game in the 1970s and has been sung at matches ever since. Supporters of the team celebrate goals by bouncing up and down and chanting &quot;Boing Boing&quot;. This dates back to the 1992–93 season, when the team was promoted from the new Second Division, with the origin of the chant still unclear. &quot;The Liquidator&quot; instrumental by the Harry J. Allstars has also been popularly played in the stadium and sung to since the late 1960s. The reggae song &quot;West Bromwich Albion&quot; by Ray King is another club anthem popularly played before matches. In recent years fans of the team have celebrated the end of each season by adopting a fancy dress theme for the final away match, including dressing as Vikings in 2004 in honour of Player of the Season Thomas Gaardsøe.

In 2002–03 Albion&#x27;s fans were voted the best in the Premier League by their peers, while in the BBC&#x27;s 2002 &quot;national intelligence test&quot; &quot;Test the Nation&quot;, they were found to be &quot;more likely to be smarter than any other football supporters, registering an average score of 138&quot;.

Famous fans include goalkeepers Aaron Ramsdale and Ben Foster, comedian Frank Skinner, TV presenter Adrian Chiles, One Direction singer Liam Payne, comedian Lenny Henry, actress Julie Walters, The Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, tennis players Ann Jones and Goran Ivanišević, television presenter Cat Deeley, DJ Dave Haslam, boxers Richie Woodhall and Tommy Langford, and guitarist Eric Clapton.

===Publications===
The club has published an official matchday programme for supporters since 1905. The publication was entitled &quot;Albion News&quot; for many years, but was renamed &quot;Albion&quot; from the 2002–03 season until the close season of 2013, when it was renamed back to &quot;Albion News&quot;. It won Premier League Programme of the Year in 2002–03 and Third Division Programme of the Year in 1991–92. In 2007–08, it was awarded Championship Programme of the Year by both Programme Monthly and the Football Programme Directory. The programme has a circulation in excess of 8,000 copies. The first West Bromwich Albion fanzine, &quot;Fingerpost&quot;, was published from 1983 until 1992, and was followed by several others, most notably &quot;Grorty Dick&quot; (1989–2005) and &quot;Last Train to Rolfe Street&quot; (1992–1995). Since &quot;Grorty Dick&quot; ceased publication in 2005, the club now only has one fanzine dedicated to it; &#x27;Baggie Shorts&#x27; which is produced by the West Bromwich Albion Supporters&#x27; Club London Branch.

===&quot;Baggies&quot; nickname===

Although known in their early days as &quot;the Throstles&quot;, the club&#x27;s more popular nickname among supporters came to be &quot;the Baggies&quot;, a term which the club itself looked down upon for many years but later embraced. The phrase was first heard at the Hawthorns in the 1900s, but its exact origins are uncertain. One suggestion is that the name was bestowed on Albion supporters by their rivals at Aston Villa, because of the large baggy trousers that many Albion fans wore at work to protect themselves from molten iron in the factories and foundries of the Black Country. Club historian Tony Matthews, however, suggests that it derives from the &quot;bagmen&quot;, who carried the club&#x27;s matchday takings in big leather bags from the turnstiles to the cash office on the halfway line. Other theories relate to the baggy shorts worn by various players during the club&#x27;s early years. The official club mascots are named &quot;Baggie Bird&quot; and &quot;Albi&quot;; both are based on the throstle depicted on the club crest.

==Rivalries==
Historically, Albion&#x27;s greatest rivals were Aston Villa from nearby Birmingham. The two clubs contested three FA Cup Finals between 1887 and 1895 (Villa winning two and Albion one). More recently, however, some Albion fans tend to see Wolverhampton Wanderers as their main rivals, particularly as between 1989 and 2002 Albion and Villa were never in the same division, but Albion were in the same division as Wolves for 11 out of 14 seasons. This had led to Aston Villa supporters now considering Birmingham City to be their fiercest rivals. A less-heated rivalry also exists with Birmingham City, with whom Albion contested the 1931 FA Cup final, as well as a semi-final in 1968.

A number of hooligan firms associate themselves with Albion, including Section 5, Clubhouse and the Smethwick Mob.

===Black Country derby===
Albion and Wolves contest the Black Country derby, one of the longest standing derbies in world football. It is considered one of the fiercest rivalries in English football. A 2008 survey found it to be the most intense rivalry in the country, with one in four fans from both clubs claiming that their rivalry went much deeper than football. The two sides have played each other 160 times, with their first major clash being an FA Cup tie in 1886. Both Albion and Wolves were founding members of the Football League in 1888, making the derby the joint oldest in English league football. 

The rivalry came to prominence when the two clubs contested the league title in 1953–54, and during the 1990s it intensified to new heights among supporters, with both clubs languishing in Division One for much of the decade and only local pride at stake. Moreover, in 2002 Albion came from being 11 points adrift to overhaul Wolves to gain promotion. The rivalry was further heightened after the sides met in the play-offs in 2007. A 2004 survey by Planetfootball.com confirmed that the majority of both Albion and Wolves supporters consider the other to be their main rival. In February 2012 the Baggies beat Wolves 5–1 away from home, with Peter Odemwingie scoring a hat-trick. The game became known as the &#x27;demolition derby&#x27;, and remains the highest scoring Black Country derby of the 21st century. Despite their geographical location, fellow Black Country club Walsall are seen as lesser rivals, having played in a lower division than Albion for most of their history.

===Rivalry with Aston Villa===
Ranked by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2010 as the most fierce in the region, games between Aston Villa and West Brom are particularly ferocious. The two first met on 9 December 1882, in the second round of the Staffordshire Cup: Villa hosted a 3–3 draw in front of 13,900 fans, while in the replay West Brom won by a single goal with an attendance of 10,500. On 3 January 1885, they met for the first time in the third round of the FA Cup: a goalless draw at West Brom was followed by a 3–0 victory for them away at Villa. The following year, both teams became founder members of the Football League. They met first in a league fixture on 19 January 1889, Villa winning 2–0 at home, before a draw the next week ending 3–3. The two teams met in two further FA Cup finals in the 19th century, a 3–0 win for West Brom in 1892 and a 1–0 win for Aston Villa in 1895.

Birmingham City were relegated from the Premier League in 2011 and Wolverhampton Wanderers a season later, leaving Aston Villa and West Brom as the only West Midlands teams in England&#x27;s top division. Without their respective main rivals and with Albion finishing above their nearest rivals for the second season in a row, the historic rivalry was rekindled to pre-1990s competitiveness. At the end of the 2015–16 season, Aston Villa were relegated, leaving West Brom as the only West Midlands team in the top flight for the 2016–17 season. After Albion&#x27;s relegation at the end of the 2017–18 Premier League, the teams faced each other in the Championship. In the 2018–19 EFL Championship play-off semi-finals, Villa controversially knocked out Albion on penalties, after the Albion had two men sent-off over both legs.

===History of Albion&#x27;s ownership and governance===
In the club&#x27;s formative years, West Bromwich Albion were run by a seven-man playing committee, and funded by each member contributing a weekly subscription of 6d (six pence) (2p). Albion&#x27;s first chairman was Henry Jackson, appointed in 1885, with the club becoming a limited company in June 1891. Other early chairmen of Albion included Jem Bayliss and Billy Bassett, both of whom had earlier played for the club. Indeed, from 1878 to 1986 there was always an Albion player or ex-player on the club&#x27;s committee or board of directors. Bassett became an Albion director in 1905, following the resignation of the previous board in its entirety. The club was in deep financial trouble and had had a writ served upon them by their bank, but Bassett and returning chairman Harry Keys rescued the club, aided by local fund-raising activities. Bassett became chairman in 1908, and helped the club to avoid bankruptcy once more in 1910 by paying the players&#x27; summer wages from his own pocket. He remains Albion&#x27;s longest-serving chairman, having held the position until his death in 1937. The club&#x27;s longest-serving director was Major H. Wilson Keys, during the period 1930–1965, including 15 years as chairman. He became vice-president of the Football Association in 1969. Sir Bert Millichip served as Albion chairman from 1974 to 1983, after which he chose to concentrate on his role as chairman of the Football Association. 

In 1996, the club became a public limited company, issuing shares to supporters at £500 and £3,000 each, under the Chairmanship of Paul Thompson. The shares were quoted on the Alternative Investment Market, but the club withdrew from the stock exchange in order to become a private company again in 2004. The name of the company thus reverted from West Bromwich Albion plc to West Bromwich Albion Limited, the latter becoming a subsidiary of West Bromwich Albion Holdings Limited. Jeremy Peace took up the post in 2002, after a rift between previous chairman Paul Thompson and manager Gary Megson forced Thompson to quit the club.

In September 2007, Peace acquired additional shares in West Bromwich Albion Holdings Limited, taking his total stake in the company to 50.56%. This triggered a requirement, under the Takeover Code, for him to make a mandatory cash offer for the remaining shares in both WBA Holdings Ltd and WBA Ltd. Later that year, Michelle Davies became Albion&#x27;s first female director. She stepped down in 2010. Jeremy Peace announced in June 2008 that he was looking for a major new investor for the club, but no firm proposals were received by the 31 July deadline. On 24 July 2015, Jeremy Peace announced that his sale exclusivity deal was called off after a potential buyer was unable to fulfil the terms of sale.

In July 2016, Peace announced that he had found a buyer in the form of a Chinese investment group headed by Lai Guochuan. The figure agreed upon is believed to have been in the region of £175 million – £200 million. The takeover was successfully completed on 15 September the same year. John Williams was originally appointed Chairman of the club before Lai replaced him with associate Li Piyue after the club&#x27;s relegation in the 2017–18 season. Lai himself took over as Chairman on 2 February 2022. The 2022–23 season saw increased scrutiny of the club&#x27;s ownership, and the practices of majority shareholder Guochuan Lai. The club&#x27;s financial situation began to receive national media attention, having already been commented on frequently in local press. Supporter action groups and in-stadium protests by fans to raise awareness of the club&#x27;s off-field issues took shape during the season, but were briefly paused in April 2023 as the club&#x27;s fans supported the side&#x27;s promotion push.

On 15 February 2024, it was announced that Florida-based entrepreneur Shilen Patel and his father, philanthropist Kiran C Patel had reached an agreement to acquire an 87.8% stake in the club, under the name Bilkul Football WBA. Shilen Patel would also be named as the Chairman of the club.

==Notable former players==

As part of the club&#x27;s 125th anniversary celebrations in 2004, a survey was commissioned via the official West Bromwich Albion website and the &quot;Express &amp; Star&quot; newspaper to determine the greatest West Brom players of all time. A modern-day, 16-man squad was compiled from the results; all selected players are depicted on a commemorative mural displayed at The Hawthorns. Fourteen of the sixteen players are English-born, with a fifteenth, Cyrille Regis, a French Guiana-born full England international. The list of 16 is as follows:

Other notable honours bestowed upon West Brom players include the PFA Young Player of the Year award, which was presented to Cyrille Regis in 1979. In 1998, Billy Bassett and Bryan Robson were named among the list of Football League 100 Legends, along with Arthur Rowley, Geoff Hurst and Johnny Giles. Bryan Robson was also an inaugural inductee into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002, to be joined two years later by Geoff Hurst. Bobby Robson, a player with Albion, has also been inducted, although this was for his achievements as a manager. In 1919–20, Fred Morris became the first Albion player to finish as top goalscorer in Division One, a feat which has since been repeated by Ronnie Allen, Derek Kevan, Jeff Astle and Tony Brown. Brown, who holds the club records for goals and appearances, was voted into the PFA Centenary Hall of Fame in July 2007.

===Player of the Year===

==Partial list of managers==

The following managers have all led West Bromwich Albion to at least one of the following achievements while in charge of the club: winning a major trophy or reaching the final, achieving a top three league finish in the top flight, winning promotion or reaching the quarter-finals of a major European competition.
==Records==
West Bromwich Albion&#x27;s record victory was their 12–0 league win against Darwen on 4 April 1892. This is still the widest margin of victory for a game in the top-flight of English football, although the record was equalled by Nottingham Forest when they beat Leicester Fosse by the same scoreline in 1909. Albion&#x27;s biggest FA Cup victory came when they beat Chatham 10–1 on 2 March 1889. The club&#x27;s record league defeat was a 3–10 loss against Stoke City on 4 February 1937, while a 0–5 defeat to Leeds United on 18 February 1967 represents Albion&#x27;s heaviest FA Cup loss.

Tony Brown holds a number of Albion&#x27;s club records. He has made the most appearances overall for the club (720), as well as most appearances in the league (574), FA Cup (54) and in European competition (17). Brown is the club&#x27;s top scorer in the league (218), the FA Cup (27) and in Europe (8). He is also the club&#x27;s record scorer overall, with 279 goals. W. G. Richardson scored 328 goals for the club, but this includes 100 during World War II, which are not normally counted towards competitive totals. Richardson holds the club record for most league goals in a single season, scoring 39 times in 1935–36.

Albion&#x27;s most capped international player, taking into account only those caps won whilst at the club, is Chris Brunt. He appeared 55 times for Northern Ireland as an Albion player, earning 65 caps in total before retiring from international football in 2017. Jesse Pennington is the club&#x27;s most capped England international, with 25 caps. The highest transfer fee paid by the club is £15 million to RB Leipzig for Oliver Burke on 25 August 2017. The record transfer fee received by Albion from another club was for the transfer of Salomón Rondón to Dalian Yifang in July 2019 for £16.5 million.

<doc id="33924" wikidata="Q134949" url="?curid=33924" title="Winter War">
<text>The Winter War was a war between the Soviet Union and Finland. It began with a Soviet invasion of Finland on 30 November 1939, three months after the outbreak of World War II, and ended three and a half months later with the Moscow Peace Treaty on 13 March 1940. Despite superior military strength, especially in tanks and aircraft, the Soviet Union suffered severe losses and initially made little headway. The League of Nations deemed the attack illegal and expelled the Soviet Union from its organization.

The Soviets made several demands, including that Finland cede substantial border territories in exchange for land elsewhere, claiming security reasonsprimarily the protection of Leningrad, from the Finnish border. When Finland refused, the Soviets invaded. Most sources conclude that the Soviet Union had intended to conquer all of Finland, and cite the establishment of the puppet Finnish Communist government and the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact&#x27;s secret protocols as evidence of this, while other sources argue against the idea of a full Soviet conquest. Finland repelled Soviet attacks for more than two months and inflicted substantial losses on the invaders in temperatures as low as . The battles focused mainly on Taipale along the Karelian Isthmus, on Kollaa in Ladoga Karelia and on Raate Road in Kainuu, but there were also battles in Salla and Petsamo in Lapland.

Following the initial setbacks, the Soviets reduced their strategic objectives and put an end to the puppet Finnish communist government in late January 1940, informing the Finnish government that they were willing to negotiate peace. After the Soviet military reorganized and adopted different tactics, they renewed their offensive in February 1940 and overcame the Finnish defences on the Karelian Isthmus. This left the Finnish army in the main theatre of war near the breaking point, with a retreat seeming inevitable. Consequently, Finnish commander-in-chief Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim urged a peace deal with the Soviets, while the Finns still retained bargaining power.

Hostilities ceased in March 1940 with the signing of the Moscow Peace Treaty in which Finland ceded 9% of its territory to the Soviet Union. Soviet losses were heavy, and the country&#x27;s international reputation suffered. Their gains exceeded their pre-war demands, and the Soviets received substantial territories along Lake Ladoga and further north. Finland retained its sovereignty and enhanced its international reputation. The poor performance of the Red Army encouraged German Chancellor Adolf Hitler to believe that an attack on the Soviet Union would be successful and confirmed negative Western opinions of the Soviet military. After 15 months of Interim Peace, in June 1941, Germany commenced Operation Barbarossa, and the Continuation War between Finland and the Soviets began.

==Background==
=== Finnish-Soviet relations and politics ===

Until the early nineteenth century, Finland was the eastern part of the Kingdom of Sweden. From 21 February 1808 to 17 September 1809, the Russian Empire waged the Finnish War against the Kingdom of Sweden, ostensibly to protect the Russian capital, Saint Petersburg. Eventually Russia conquered and annexed Finland, and converted it into an autonomous buffer state. The resulting Grand Duchy of Finland enjoyed wide autonomy within Russia until the end of the nineteenth century, when Russia began attempts to assimilate Finland as part of a general policy to strengthen the central government and unify the Empire by Russification. Those attempts were aborted because of Russia&#x27;s internal strife, but they ruined Russia&#x27;s relationship with Finland. In addition, support increased in Finland for self-determination movements.

World War I led to the collapse of the Russian Empire during the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Russian Civil War. On 15 November 1917, the Bolshevik Russian government declared that national minorities possessed the right of self-determination, including the right to secede and form a separate state, which gave Finland a window of opportunity. On 6 December 1917, the Senate of Finland declared the nation&#x27;s independence. Soviet Russia, later the Soviet Union, recognised the new Finnish government just three weeks after the declaration. Finland achieved full sovereignty in May 1918 after a four-month civil war in which the conservative Whites defeated the socialist Reds with the help of the Imperial German Army, pro-German Jägers, and some Swedish troops, in addition to the expulsion of Bolshevik troops.

Finland joined the League of Nations in 1920 and sought security guarantees, but Finland&#x27;s primary goal was co-operation with the Scandinavian countries, mainly Sweden, and it focused on the exchange of information and on defence planning (the joint defence of Åland, for example), rather than on military exercises or on the stockpiling and the deployment of materiel. Nevertheless, Sweden carefully avoided committing itself to Finnish foreign policy. Finland&#x27;s military policy included clandestine defence co-operation with Estonia.

The period after the Finnish Civil War to the early 1930s was a politically unstable time in Finland because of the continued rivalry between the conservatives and the socialists. The Communist Party of Finland was declared illegal in 1931, and the nationalist Lapua Movement organised anticommunist violence, which culminated in a failed coup attempt in 1932. The successor of the Lapua Movement, the Patriotic People&#x27;s Movement, had a minor presence in national politics and never had more than 14 seats of the 200 in the Finnish Parliament. By the late 1930s, the export-oriented Finnish economy was growing and the nation&#x27;s extreme political movements had diminished.
After Soviet involvement in the Finnish Civil War in 1918, no formal peace treaty was signed. In 1918 and 1919, Finnish volunteers conducted two unsuccessful military incursions across the Soviet border, the Viena and Aunus expeditions, to annex areas in Karelia that according to the Greater Finland ideology would combine all Baltic Finnic peoples into a single state. In 1920, Finnish communists based in Soviet Russia attempted to assassinate the former Finnish White Guard Commander-in-Chief, Marshal Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim. On 14 October 1920, Finland and Soviet Russia signed the Treaty of Tartu, confirming the old border between the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland and Imperial Russia proper as the new Finnish–Soviet border. Finland also received Petsamo Province, with its ice-free harbour on the Arctic Ocean. Despite the signing of the treaty, relations between the two countries remained strained. The Finnish government allowed volunteers to cross the border to support the East Karelian uprising in Russia in 1921, and Finnish communists in the Soviet Union continued to prepare for revenge and staged a cross-border raid into Finland, the Pork Mutiny, in 1922. In 1932, the Soviet–Finnish Non-Aggression Pact was signed between both countries, and it was reaffirmed for ten years in 1934. Foreign trade in Finland was booming, but less than 1% of it was with the Soviet Union. In 1934, the Soviet Union also joined the League of Nations.

=== Justification ===
Soviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin regarded it a disappointment that the Soviet Union could not halt the Finnish Revolution. He thought that the pro-Finland movement in Karelia posed a direct threat to Leningrad and that the area and defences of Finland could be used to invade the Soviet Union or restrict fleet movements. Soviet propaganda then painted Finland&#x27;s leadership as a &quot;vicious and reactionary fascist clique&quot;. Field Marshal Mannerheim and Väinö Tanner, the leader of the Finnish Social Democratic Party, were targeted for particular scorn. When Stalin gained absolute power through the Great Purge of 1938, the Soviets changed their foreign policy toward Finland and began to pursue the reconquest of the provinces of Tsarist Russia that had been lost during the chaos of the October Revolution of 1917 and the Russian Civil War almost two decades earlier. Soviet leaders believed that the old empire&#x27;s extended borders provided territorial security and wanted Leningrad, only from the Finnish border, to enjoy a similar level of security against the rising power of Nazi Germany.

=== Negotiations ===

In April 1938, NKVD agent Boris Yartsev contacted Finnish Foreign Minister Rudolf Holsti and Finnish Prime Minister Aimo Cajander, stating that the Soviets did not trust Germany and that war was considered possible between the two countries. The Red Army would not wait passively behind the border but would rather &quot;advance to meet the enemy&quot;. Finnish representatives assured Yartsev that Finland was committed to a policy of neutrality and that the country would resist any armed incursion. Yartsev suggested that Finland cede or lease some islands in the Gulf of Finland along the seaward approaches to Leningrad, but Finland refused.

Negotiations continued throughout 1938 without results. The Finnish reception of Soviet entreaties was decidedly cool, as the violent collectivisation and purges in Stalin&#x27;s Soviet Union resulted in a poor opinion of the country. Most of the Finnish communist elite in the Soviet Union had been executed during the Great Purge, further tarnishing the Soviets&#x27; image in Finland. Meanwhile, Finland was attempting to negotiate a military co-operation plan with Sweden and hoping to jointly defend Åland.

The Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in August 1939. It was publicly a non-aggression treaty, but it included a secret protocol in which Central and Eastern European countries were divided into spheres of influence. Finland fell into the Soviet sphere. On 1 September 1939, Germany began its invasion of Poland, and two days later, the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany. On 17 September, the Soviet invasion of Poland began. After the fall of Poland, Germany and the Soviet Union exchanged occupied Polish lands to establish a new border in accordance with the provisions of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were soon forced to accept treaties that allowed the Soviets to establish military bases on their soil. Estonia accepted the ultimatum by signing the agreement on 28 September. Latvia and Lithuania followed in October. Unlike the three Baltic countries, Finland started a gradual mobilisation under the guise of &quot;additional refresher training&quot;. The Soviets had already started intensive mobilisation near the Finnish border in 1938–39. Assault troops thought to be necessary for the invasion did not begin deployment until October 1939. Operational plans made in September called for the invasion to start in November.

On 5 October 1939, the Soviets invited a Finnish delegation to Moscow for negotiations. Juho Kusti Paasikivi, the Finnish envoy to Sweden, was sent to Moscow to represent the Finnish government Furthermore, the negotiations were attended by Stalin in person, signalling the seriousness of the effort. Paasikivi would later recount his surprise over the friendly atmosphere in which the delegation was received, and mentioned the pleasant manners of Stalin towards them.

The meetings began on 12 October, with Molotov&#x27;s offer of a mutual assistance pact, which the Finns immediately refused. To the Finns&#x27; surprise, Molotov dropped the offer and instead proposed an exchange of territory. The offer stipulated that the Finnish-Soviet border on the Karelian Isthmus be moved westward to a point only east of Viipuri () and that Finland destroy all existing fortifications on the Karelian Isthmus. Likewise, the delegation demanded the cession of islands in the Gulf of Finland as well as Rybachy Peninsula (). The Finns would also have to lease the Hanko Peninsula for 30 years and to permit the Soviets to establish a military base there. In exchange, the Soviet Union would cede Repola and Porajärvi from Eastern Karelia (2120 square miles), an area twice the size as that of the territory demanded from Finland (1000 square miles).

The Soviet offer divided the Finnish government: Gustaf Mannerheim had argued for an agreement, being pessimistic of the Finnish prospects in a war against the Soviet Union. But the Finnish government was reticent in reaching an agreement out of mistrust for Stalin: there was a fear of repeated follow-up demands, which would have put the future of Finnish sovereignty in danger. There were also those, such as Foreign Minister Eljas Erkko and Prime Minister Aimo Cajander, and the Finnish intelligence in general, who mistook the demands and the Soviet military build-up as a mere bluff on the part of Stalin, and were thus disinclined to reach an agreement.

The Finns made two counteroffers to cede the Terijoki area to the Soviet Union. That would double the distance between Leningrad and the Finnish border but was far less than the Soviets had demanded. The Finns would also cede the islands in the Gulf of Finland, but they would not agree to lease any territory to the USSR for military purposes.

On the next meeting on 23 October, Stalin conceded to lessen his demands: a reduction in the amount of land demanded in Karelia; a reduction of the Hanko garrison from 5000 to 4000 men; and reducing the length of lease from 30 years to whatever date the ongoing (second world) war in Europe would end. However, this sudden change, contrary to previous statements that Soviet demands were minimalist and thus unalterable, had surprised the Finnish government, and lead them to believe more concession may be forthcoming. Thus, Paasikivi&#x27;s idea of reaching some sort of compromise by offering the Soviets the island of Jussarö and the fort of Ino were refused by Helsinki.

On 31 October, Molotov publicly announced the Soviet demands to the Supreme Soviet. This surprised the Finns, and lent credibility to Soviet claims that their demands were minimalist and thus unalterable, as it would have been impossible to reduce them without a loss of prestige after having made them public. However, the Soviet offer was eventually rejected with respect to the opinion of the public and Parliament.

At the meeting on 9 November, Paasikivi announced to the attending Stalin and Molotov the Finnish refusal to accept even their reduced demands. The Soviets were visibly surprised. Finnish Foreign Minister Vaino Tanner later wrote that &quot;the eyes of our opposite numbers opened wide&quot;. Stalin had asked &quot;You don&#x27;t even offer Ino?&quot; This would become the final meeting: the Soviets stopped responding to further Finnish letters and on 13 November, when the Finnish delegation was recalled from Moscow, no Soviet officials came to see them off. The Finns had left under the expectation that the negotiations would continue. Instead, the Soviet Union ramped up its military preparations.

The negotiations had failed, as neither side was willing to substantially reduce their demands, nor was either side able to fully trust the other. The Finns were fearful of an encroachment on their sovereignty, while the Soviets were (claiming to be) fearful of a springboard for international enemies in Finland, in close proximity to Leningrad. No promises to the contrary managed to persuade the other. Additionally, both sides had misunderstood the others position: the Finns had assumed that the Soviets had opened up on a maximalist demand, ready to be traded down smaller. The Soviets instead had stressed the minimalist nature of their demands, and were incredulous over Finnish reluctance to agree. Finally, there was also Stalin&#x27;s unwillingness or inability to accept that any territorial concessions on the part of Finland would have only been possible by a 4/5th majority in the Finnish parliament. He had mocked such a requirement, proposing that they count his and Molotov&#x27;s votes, too.

===Shelling of Mainila and Soviet intentions===
On 26 November 1939, an incident was reported near the Soviet village of Mainila, near the border with Finland. A Soviet border guard post had been shelled by an unknown party resulting, according to Soviet reports, in the deaths of four and injuries of nine border guards. Research conducted by several Finnish and Russian historians later concluded that the shelling was a false flag operation since there were no artillery units there, and it was carried out from the Soviet side of the border by an NKVD unit with the purpose of providing the Soviets with a &quot;casus belli&quot; and a pretext to withdraw from the non-aggression pact. Soviet war games held in March 1938 and 1939 had been based on a scenario in which border incidents taking place at the village of Mainila would spark the war.

Molotov claimed that the incident was a Finnish artillery attack. He demanded that Finland apologise for the incident and to move its forces beyond a line from the border. Finland denied responsibility for the attack, rejected the demands and called for a joint Finnish–Soviet commission to examine the incident. In turn, the Soviet Union claimed that the Finnish response was hostile, renounced the non-aggression pact and severed diplomatic relations with Finland on 28 November. In the following years, Soviet historiography described the incident as Finnish provocation. Doubt on the official Soviet version was cast only in the late 1980s, during the policy of &quot;glasnost&quot;. The issue has continued to divide Russian historiography even after the end of the Soviet Union in 1991.

====Soviet intentions====
In 2013, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated at a meeting with military historians that the Soviets had launched the Winter War to &quot;correct mistakes&quot; made in determining the border with Finland after 1917. Opinion on the scale of the initial Soviet invasion decision is divided. The puppet Finnish communist government and the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact&#x27;s secret protocol is used as proof that the Soviet Union had intended to conquer all of Finland.

On 1 December 1939, the Soviet Union formed a puppet government, named the Finnish Democratic Republic, to govern Finland after Soviet conquest. A declaration delivered via TASS stated:

Soviet leaflets dropped over Helsinki on the first day of the war stated: &quot;Finnish Comrades! We come to you not as conquerors, but as liberators of the Finnish people from the oppression of the capitalists and the landlords&quot;.

In 1939, Soviet military leadership had formulated a realistic and comprehensive plan for the occupation of Finland. However, Joseph Stalin was not pleased with the conservative pace that the operation required and demanded new plans be drawn up. With the new plans, the key deadline for Finland&#x27;s capitulation was to be Stalin&#x27;s 60th birthday on 21 December. Convinced of the invasion&#x27;s forthcoming success, Andrei Zhdanov, chairman of the highest legislative body in the Soviet Union, commissioned a celebratory piece of music from Dmitri Shostakovich, &quot;Suite on Finnish Themes&quot;, intended to be performed as the marching bands of the Red Army paraded through Helsinki. The Soviets were confident that the Western powers would not come to Finland&#x27;s aid. Ivan Maisky, the Soviet ambassador to the UK, said: &quot;Who would help? The Swedes? The British? The Americans? There&#x27;s no way in hell. There will be a fuss in the press, moral support, moaning and whining. But troops, aircraft, cannons, and machine guns – no.&quot;

Hungarian historian István Ravasz wrote that the Soviet Central Committee had set out in 1939 that the former borders of the Tsarist Empire were to be restored, including Finland. American political scientist Dan Reiter stated that the Soviets &quot;sought to impose a regime change&quot; and thus &quot;achieve absolute victory&quot;. He quoted Molotov, who had commented in November 1939 on the regime change plan to a Soviet ambassador that the new government &quot;will not be Soviet, but one of a democratic republic. Nobody is going to set up Soviets over there, but we hope it will be a government we can come to terms with as to ensure the security of Leningrad&quot;. According to Russian historian Yuri Kilin, the Soviet terms encompassed the strongest fortified approaches of the Finnish defences for a reason. He claimed that Stalin had little hope for such a deal but would play for time for the ongoing mobilisation. He stated the objective as being to secure Finland from being used as a staging ground by means of regime change.

Others argue against the idea of a complete Soviet conquest. American historian William R. Trotter asserted that Stalin&#x27;s objective was to secure Leningrad&#x27;s flank from a possible German invasion through Finland. He stated that &quot;the strongest argument&quot; against a Soviet intention of full conquest is that it did not happen in either 1939 or during the Continuation War in 1944 even though Stalin &quot;could have done so with comparative ease&quot;. Bradley Lightbody wrote that the &quot;entire Soviet aim had been to make the Soviet border more secure&quot;. In 2002, Russian historian A. Chubaryan stated that no documents had been found in Russian archives that support a Soviet plan to annex Finland. Rather, the objective was to gain Finnish territory and to reinforce Soviet influence in the region.

Another American historian Stephen Kotkin also shares the position that the Soviet Union did not aim for annexation. He points out the different treatment Finland was given, compared to the Baltics: unlike the pacts of mutual assistance that the Baltics were pressured into, resulting in their total Sovietization, the Soviets demanded limited territorial concessions from Finland, and even offered land in return, which would not have made sense if full Sovietization was intended. And according to Kotkin, Stalin seemed to be genuinely interested in reaching an agreement during the negotiations: he had personally attended six of the seven meetings with the Finns, and had multiple times reduced his demands. However, mutual mistrust and misunderstandings would mar the negotiations, producing an impasse.

==Opposing forces==
===Soviet military plan===
Before the war, Soviet leadership had expected total victory within a few weeks. The Red Army had just completed the invasion of eastern Poland at a cost of fewer than 4,000 casualties after Germany attacked Poland from the west. Stalin&#x27;s expectations of a quick Soviet triumph were backed up by politician Andrei Zhdanov and military strategist Kliment Voroshilov, but other generals were more reserved. Red Army Chief of Staff Boris Shaposhnikov advocated a narrow-front assault right on the Karelian isthmus. Additionally, Shaposhnikov argued for a fuller build-up, extensive fire support and logistical preparations, a rational order of battle and the deployment of the army&#x27;s best units. Zhdanov&#x27;s military commander, Kirill Meretskov, reported, &quot;The terrain of coming operations is split by lakes, rivers, swamps, and is almost entirely covered by forests... The proper use of our forces will be difficult&quot;. These doubts were not reflected in Meretskov&#x27;s troop deployments, and he publicly announced that the Finnish campaign would take two weeks at most. Soviet soldiers had even been warned not to cross the border mistakenly into Sweden.

Stalin&#x27;s purges in the 1930s had devastated the officer corps of the Red Army; those purged included three of its five marshals, 220 of its 264 division or higher-level commanders and 36,761 officers of all ranks. Fewer than half of all the officers remained. They were commonly replaced by soldiers who were less competent but more loyal to their superiors. Unit commanders were overseen by political commissars, whose approval was needed to approve and ratify military decisions, which they evaluated based on their political merits. The dual system further complicated the Soviet chain of command and annulled the independence of commanding officers.

After the Soviet success at the Battles of Khalkhin Gol against Japan, on the USSR&#x27;s eastern border, Soviet High Command had divided into two factions. One side was represented by the Spanish Civil War veterans General Pavel Rychagov from the Soviet Air Forces; the tank expert General Dmitry Pavlov and Stalin&#x27;s favourite general, Marshal Grigory Kulik, the chief of artillery. The other faction was led by Khalkhin Gol veterans General Georgy Zhukov of the Red Army and General Grigory Kravchenko of the Soviet Air Forces. Under this divided command structure, the lessons of the Soviet Union&#x27;s &quot;first real war on a massive scale using tanks, artillery, and aircraft&quot; at Khalkin Gol went unheeded. As a result, Russian BT tanks were less successful during the Winter War, and it took the Soviet Union three months and over a million men to accomplish what Zhukov had managed at Khalkhin Gol in ten days (albeit in completely different circumstances).

===Soviet order of battle===

Soviet generals were impressed by the success of German &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; tactics, but they had been tailored to conditions in Central Europe, with its dense well-mapped network of paved roads. Armies fighting there had recognised supply and communications centres, which could be easily targeted by armoured vehicle regiments. Finnish Army centres, in contrast, were deep inside the country. There were no paved roads, and even gravel or dirt roads were scarce. Most of the terrain consisted of trackless forests and swamps. The war correspondent John Langdon-Davies observed the landscape: &quot;Every acre of its surface was created to be the despair of an attacking military force&quot;. Waging &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; in Finland was a highly-difficult proposition, and according to Trotter, the Red Army failed to meet the level of tactical co-ordination and local initiative that would be required to execute such tactics in Finland.

Commander of the Leningrad Military District Kiril Meretskov initially ran the overall operation against the Finns. The command was passed on 9 December 1939 to the General Staff Supreme Command (later known as Stavka), directly under Kliment Voroshilov (chairman), Nikolai Kuznetsov, Stalin and Boris Shaposhnikov. On 28 December, when Stalin asked for volunteers to take over military command, Semyon Timoshenko offered himself on the condition that he be allowed to implement Shaposhnikov&#x27;s initial plan of a focused attack on the Karelian Isthmus to break the Mannerheim Line; it was accepted. In January 1940, the Leningrad Military District was reformed and renamed &quot;North-Western Front&quot;.

The Soviet forces were organised as follows:

* The 7th Army, comprising nine divisions, a tank corps and three tank brigades, was located on the Karelian Isthmus. Its objective was to quickly overrun the Finnish defenses on the Karelian Isthmus and conquer Viipuri. From there, the 7th Army was to continue towards Lappeenranta, then turn west towards Lahti, before the final push to the capital Helsinki. The force was later divided into the 7th and 13th Armies.
* The 8th Army, comprising six divisions and a tank brigade, was north of Lake Ladoga. Its mission was to execute a flanking manoeuvre around the northern shore of Lake Ladoga to strike at the rear of the Mannerheim Line.
* The 9th Army was positioned to strike into Central Finland through the Kainuu region. It was composed of three divisions with one more on its way. Its mission was to thrust westward to cut Finland in half.
* The 14th Army, comprising three divisions, was based in Murmansk. Its objectives were to capture the Arctic port of Petsamo and then advance to the town of Rovaniemi.

===Finnish order of battle===

The Finnish strategy was dictated by geography. The border with the Soviet Union was mostly impassable except along a handful of unpaved roads. In prewar calculations, the Finnish Defence Command, which had established its wartime headquarters at Mikkeli, had estimated seven Soviet divisions on the Karelian Isthmus and no more than five along the whole border north of Lake Ladoga. In the estimation, the manpower ratio would have favoured the attacker by three to one. The true ratio was much higher, however, since for example, 12 Soviet divisions were deployed north of Lake Ladoga.

Finland had a large force of reservists, which was trained in regular maneuvers, some of which had experience from the recent Finnish Civil War. The soldiers were also almost universally trained in basic survival techniques, such as skiing. The Finnish Army was not able to equip all its soldiers with proper uniforms at the outbreak of war, but its reservists were equipped with warm civilian clothing. However, the sparsely-populated highly-agrarian Finland had to draft so many of its working men that the Finnish economy was massively strained because of a lack of workers. An even greater problem than lack of soldiers was the lack of materiel since foreign shipments of anti-tank weapons and aircraft were arriving only in small quantities. The ammunition situation was alarming, as stockpiles had cartridges, shells and fuel to last only 19 to 60 days. The ammunition shortage meant the Finns could seldom afford counter-battery or saturation fire. Finnish tank forces were operationally nonexistent. The ammunition situation was alleviated somewhat since Finns were largely armed with Mosin–Nagant rifles dating from the Finnish Civil War, which used the same 7.62×54mmR cartridge that was used by Soviet forces. The situation was so severe that Finnish soldiers sometimes had to maintain their ammunition supply by looting the bodies of dead Soviet soldiers.

The Finnish forces were positioned as follows:

* The Army of the Isthmus was composed of six divisions under the command of Hugo Österman. The II Army Corps was positioned on its right flank and the III Army Corps, on its left flank.
* The IV Army Corps was located north of Lake Ladoga. It was composed of two divisions under Juho Heiskanen, who was soon replaced by Woldemar Hägglund.
* The North Finland Group was a collection of White Guards, border guards and drafted reservist units under Wiljo Tuompo.

==Soviet invasion==
=== Start of invasion and political operations ===
On 30 November 1939, Soviet forces invaded Finland with 21 divisions, totalling 450,000 men, and bombed Helsinki, killing about 100 citizens and destroying more than 50 buildings. In response to international criticism, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov stated that the Soviet Air Force was not bombing Finnish cities but rather dropping humanitarian aid to the starving Finnish population; the bombs were sarcastically dubbed Molotov bread baskets by Finns. The Finnish statesman J. K. Paasikivi commented that the Soviet attack without a declaration of war violated three separate non-aggression pacts: the Treaty of Tartu, which was signed in 1920, the non-aggression pact between Finland and the Soviet Union, which was signed in 1932 and again in 1934; and also the Covenant of the League of Nations, which the Soviet Union signed in 1934. Field Marshal C.G.E. Mannerheim was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Defence Forces after the Soviet attack. In a further reshuffling, Aimo Cajander&#x27;s caretaker cabinet was replaced by Risto Ryti and his cabinet, with Väinö Tanner as foreign minister because of opposition to Cajander&#x27;s prewar politics. Finland brought the matter of the Soviet invasion before the League of Nations. The League expelled the Soviet Union on 14 December 1939 and exhorted its members to aid Finland.

Headed by Otto Wille Kuusinen, the Finnish Democratic Republic puppet government operated in the parts of Finnish Karelia occupied by the Soviets, and was also referred to as the &quot;Terijoki Government&quot;, after the village of Terijoki, the first settlement captured by the advancing Red Army. After the war, the puppet government was reabsorbed into the Soviet Union. From the very outset of the war, working-class Finns stood behind the legitimate government in Helsinki. Finnish national unity against the Soviet invasion was later called the spirit of the Winter War.

===First battles and Soviet advance to Mannerheim Line===
The array of Finnish defence structures that during the war started to be called the Mannerheim Line was located on the Karelian Isthmus approximately from the Soviet border. The Red Army soldiers on the Isthmus numbered 250,000, facing 130,000 Finns. The Finnish command deployed a defence in depth of about 21,000 men in the area in front of the Mannerheim Line to delay and damage the Red Army before it reached the line. In combat, the most severe cause of confusion among Finnish soldiers was Soviet tanks. The Finns had few anti-tank weapons and insufficient training in modern anti-tank tactics. According to Trotter, the favoured Soviet armoured tactic was a simple frontal charge, the weaknesses of which could be exploited. The Finns learned that at close range, tanks could be dealt with in many ways; for example, logs and crowbars jammed into the bogie wheels would often immobilise a tank. Soon, Finns fielded a better ad hoc weapon, the Molotov cocktail, a glass bottle filled with flammable liquids and with a simple hand-lit fuse. Molotov cocktails were eventually mass-produced by the Finnish &quot;Alko&quot; alcoholic-beverage corporation and bundled with matches with which to light them. 80 Soviet tanks were destroyed in the border zone engagements.

By 6 December, all of the Finnish covering forces had withdrawn to the Mannerheim Line. The Red Army began its first major attack against the Line in Taipalethe area between the shore of Lake Ladoga, the Taipale river and the Suvanto waterway. Along the Suvanto sector, the Finns had a slight advantage of elevation and dry ground to dig into. The Finnish artillery had scouted the area and made fire plans in advance, anticipating a Soviet assault. The Battle of Taipale began with a forty-hour Soviet artillery preparation. After the barrage, Soviet infantry attacked across open ground but was repulsed with heavy casualties. From 6 to 12 December, the Red Army continued to try to engage using only a single division. Next, the Red Army strengthened its artillery and deployed tanks and the 150th Rifle Division forward to the Taipale front. On 14 December, the bolstered Soviet forces launched a new attack but were pushed back again. A third Soviet division entered the fight but performed poorly and panicked under shell fire. The assaults continued without success, and the Red Army suffered heavy losses. One typical Soviet attack during the battle lasted just an hour but left 1,000 dead and 27 tanks strewn on the ice. North of Lake Ladoga on the Ladoga Karelia front, the defending Finnish units relied on the terrain. Ladoga Karelia, a large forest wilderness, did not have road networks for the modern Red Army. The Soviet 8th Army had extended a new railroad line to the border, which could double the supply capability on the front. On 12 December, the advancing Soviet 139th Rifle Division, supported by the 56th Rifle Division, was defeated by a much smaller Finnish force under Paavo Talvela in Tolvajärvi, the first Finnish victory of the war.

In Central and Northern Finland, roads were few and the terrain hostile. The Finns did not expect large-scale Soviet attacks, but the Soviets sent eight divisions, heavily supported by armour and artillery. The 155th Rifle Division attacked at Lieksa, and further north the 44th attacked at Kuhmo. The 163rd Rifle Division was deployed at Suomussalmi and ordered to cut Finland in half by advancing on the Raate road. In Finnish Lapland, the Soviet 88th and 122nd Rifle Divisions attacked at Salla. The Arctic port of Petsamo was attacked by the 104th Mountain Rifle Division by sea and land, supported by naval gunfire.

==Operations from December to January==
===Weather conditions===

The winter of 1939–40 was exceptionally cold with the Karelian Isthmus experiencing a record low temperature of on 16 January 1940. At the beginning of the war, only those Finnish soldiers who were in active service had uniforms and weapons. The rest had to make do with their own clothing, which for many soldiers was their normal winter clothing with a semblance of insignia added. Finnish soldiers were skilled in cross-country skiing. The cold, snow, forest, and long hours of darkness were factors that the Finns could use to their advantage. The Finns dressed in layers, and the ski troopers wore a lightweight white snow cape. This snow-camouflage made the ski troopers almost invisible so that they could more easily execute guerrilla attacks against Soviet columns. At the beginning of the war, Soviet tanks were painted in standard olive drab and men dressed in regular khaki uniforms. Not until late January 1940 did the Soviets paint their equipment white and issue snowsuits to their infantry.

Most Soviet soldiers had proper winter clothes, but this was not the case with every unit. In the Battle of Suomussalmi, thousands of Soviet soldiers died of frostbite. The Soviet troops also lacked skill in skiing, so soldiers were restricted to movement by road and were forced to move in long columns. The Red Army lacked proper winter tents, and troops had to sleep in improvised shelters. Some Soviet units incurred frostbite casualties as high as ten per cent even before crossing the Finnish border. However, the cold weather did give an advantage to Soviet tanks, as they could move over frozen terrain and bodies of water, rather than being immobilised in swamps and mud. According to Krivosheev, at least 61,506 Soviet troops were sick or frostbitten during the war.

===Finnish guerrilla tactics===

In battles from Ladoga Karelia to the Arctic port of Petsamo, the Finns used guerrilla tactics. The Red Army was superior in numbers and material, but Finns used the advantages of speed, manoeuvre warfare and economy of force. Particularly on the Ladoga Karelia front and during the Battle of Raate Road, the Finns isolated smaller portions of numerically superior Soviet forces. With Soviet forces divided into smaller groups, the Finns dealt with them individually and attacked from all sides.

For many of the encircled Soviet troops in a pocket (called a &quot;motti&quot; in Finnish, originally meaning of firewood), staying alive was an ordeal comparable to combat. The men were freezing and starving and endured poor sanitary conditions. Historian William R. Trotter described these conditions as follows: &quot;The Soviet soldier had no choice. If he refused to fight, he would be shot. If he tried to sneak through the forest, he would freeze to death. And surrender was no option for him; Soviet propaganda had told him how the Finns would torture prisoners to death.&quot; The problem however was that the Finns were mostly too weak to fully exploit their success. Some of the pockets of encircled Soviet soldiers held out for weeks and even months, binding a huge number of Finnish forces.

===Battles of the Mannerheim Line===
The terrain on the Karelian Isthmus did not allow guerrilla tactics, so the Finns were forced to resort to the more conventional Mannerheim Line, with its flanks protected by large bodies of water. Soviet propaganda claimed that it was as strong as or even stronger than the Maginot Line. Finnish historians, for their part, have belittled the line&#x27;s strength, insisting that it was mostly conventional trenches and log-covered dugouts. The Finns had built 221 strong-points along the Karelian Isthmus, mostly in the early 1920s. Many were extended in the late 1930s. Despite these defensive preparations, even the most fortified section of the Mannerheim Line had only one reinforced-concrete bunker per kilometre. Overall, the line was weaker than similar lines in mainland Europe. According to the Finns, the real strength of the line was the &quot;stubborn defenders with a lot of &quot;sisu&quot;&quot; – a Finnish idiom roughly translated as &quot;guts, fighting spirit&quot;.

On the eastern side of the Isthmus, the Red Army attempted to break through the Mannerheim Line at the battle of Taipale. On the western side, Soviet units faced the Finnish line at Summa, near the city of Viipuri, on 16 December. The Finns had built 41 reinforced-concrete bunkers in the Summa area, making the defensive line in this area stronger than anywhere else on the Karelian Isthmus. Because of a mistake in planning, the nearby Munasuo swamp had a -wide gap in the line. During the First Battle of Summa, a number of Soviet tanks broke through the thin line on 19 December, but the Soviets could not benefit from the situation because of insufficient co-operation between branches of service. The Finns remained in their trenches, allowing the Soviet tanks to move freely behind the Finnish line, as the Finns had no proper anti-tank weapons. The Finns succeeded in repelling the main Soviet assault. The tanks, stranded behind enemy lines, attacked the strongpoints at random until they were eventually destroyed, 20 in all. By 22 December, the battle ended in a Finnish victory.

The Soviet advance was stopped at the Mannerheim Line. Red Army troops suffered from poor morale and a shortage of supplies, eventually refusing to participate in more suicidal frontal attacks. The Finns, led by General Harald Öhquist, decided to launch a counter-attack and encircle three Soviet divisions into a &quot;motti&quot; near Viipuri on 23 December. Öhquist&#x27;s plan was bold; however it failed. The Finns lost 1,300 men, and the Soviets were later estimated to have lost a similar number.

===Battles in Ladoga Karelia and North Karelia===
The strength of the Red Army north of Lake Ladoga in Ladoga Karelia surprised the Finnish Headquarters. Two Finnish divisions were deployed there, the 12th Division led by Lauri Tiainen and the 13th Division led by Hannu Hannuksela. They also had a support group of three brigades, bringing their total strength to over 30,000. The Soviets deployed a division for almost every road leading west to the Finnish border. The 8th Army was led by Ivan Khabarov, who was replaced by Grigory Shtern on 13 December. The Soviets&#x27; mission was to destroy the Finnish troops in the area of Ladoga Karelia and advance into the area between Sortavala and Joensuu within 10 days. The Soviets had a 3:1 advantage in manpower and a 5:1 advantage in artillery, as well as air supremacy.

Finnish forces panicked and retreated in front of the overwhelming Red Army. The commander of the Finnish IV Army Corps Juho Heiskanen was replaced by Woldemar Hägglund on 4 December. On 7 December, in the middle of the Ladoga Karelian front, Finnish units retreated near the small stream of Kollaa. The waterway itself did not offer protection, but alongside it, there were ridges up to high. The ensuing battle of Kollaa lasted until the end of the war. A memorable quote, &quot;Kollaa holds&quot; () became a legendary motto among Finns. Further contributing to the legend of Kollaa was the sniper Simo Häyhä, dubbed &quot;the White Death&quot; in Finnish media. and credited with over 500 kills. Captain Aarne Juutilainen, dubbed &quot;the Terror of Morocco&quot;, also became a living legend in the Battle of Kollaa. To the north, the Finns retreated from Ägläjärvi to Tolvajärvi on 5 December and then repelled a Soviet offensive in the battle of Tolvajärvi on 11 December.

In the south, two Soviet divisions were united on the northern side of the Lake Ladoga coastal road. As before, these divisions were trapped as the more mobile Finnish units counterattacked from the north to flank the Soviet columns. On 19 December, the Finns temporarily ceased their assaults due to exhaustion. It was not until the period of 6–16 January 1940 that the Finns resumed their offensive, dividing Soviet divisions into smaller &quot;mottis.&quot; Contrary to Finnish expectations, the encircled Soviet divisions did not try to break through to the east but instead entrenched. They were expecting reinforcements and supplies to arrive by air. As the Finns lacked the necessary heavy artillery equipment and were short of men, they often did not directly attack the &quot;mottis&quot; they had created; instead, they worked to eliminate only the most dangerous threats. Often the &quot;motti&quot; tactic was not applied as a strategy, but as a Finnish adaptation to the behaviour of Soviet troops under fire. In spite of the cold and hunger, the Soviet troops did not surrender easily but fought bravely, often entrenching their tanks to be used as pillboxes and building timber dugouts. Some specialist Finnish soldiers were called in to attack the &quot;mottis&quot;; the most famous of them was Major Matti Aarnio, or &quot;Motti-Matti&quot; as he became known.

In North Karelia, Soviet forces were outmanoeuvred at Ilomantsi and Lieksa. The Finns used effective guerrilla tactics, taking special advantage of their superior skiing skills and snow-white layered clothing and executing surprise ambushes and raids. By the end of December, the Soviets decided to retreat and transfer resources to more critical fronts.

===Battles in Kainuu===
The Suomussalmi–Raate engagement was a double operation which would later be used by military academics as a classic example of what well-led troops and innovative tactics can do against a much larger adversary. Suomussalmi was a municipality of 4,000 with long lakes, wild forests and few roads. The Finnish command believed that the Soviets would not attack there, but the Red Army committed two divisions to the Kainuu area with orders to cross the wilderness, capture the city of Oulu and effectively cut Finland in two. There were two roads leading to Suomussalmi from the frontier: the northern Juntusranta road and the southern Raate road.

The Battle of Raate Road, which occurred during the month-long Battle of Suomussalmi, resulted in one of the largest Soviet losses in the Winter War. The Soviet 44th and parts of the 163rd Rifle Division, comprising about 14,000 troops, were almost completely destroyed by a Finnish ambush as they marched along the forest road. A small unit blocked the Soviet advance while Finnish Colonel Hjalmar Siilasvuo and his 9th Division cut off the retreat route, split the enemy force into smaller &quot;mottis&quot;, and then proceeded to destroy the remnants in detail as they retreated. The Soviets suffered 7,000–9,000 casualties; the Finnish units, 400. The Finnish troops captured dozens of tanks, artillery pieces, anti-tank guns, hundreds of trucks, almost 2,000 horses, thousands of rifles, and much-needed ammunition and medical supplies. So sure of their victory had the Soviets been that a military band, complete with instruments, banners and notes, was traveling with the 44th Division to perform in a victory parade. The Finns found their instruments among the captured materiel.

===Battles in Finnish Lapland===
The Finnish area of Lapland, bestriding the Arctic Circle, is sparsely developed, with little daylight and persistent snow-cover during winter; the Finns expected nothing more than raiding parties and reconnaissance patrols. Instead, the Soviets sent full divisions. On 11 December, the Finns rearranged the defence of Lapland and detached the Lapland Group from the North Finland Group. The group was placed under the command of Kurt Wallenius.

In southern Lapland, near the village of Salla, the Soviet 88th and 122nd Divisions, totaling 35,000 men, advanced. In the Battle of Salla, the Soviets proceeded easily to Salla, where the road split. Further ahead was Kemijärvi, while the fork to Pelkosenniemi led northwest. On 17 December, the Soviet northern group, comprising an infantry regiment, a battalion, and a company of tanks, was outflanked by a Finnish battalion. The 122nd retreated, abandoning much of its heavy equipment and vehicles. Following this success, the Finns shuttled reinforcements to the defensive line in front of Kemijärvi. The Soviets hammered the defensive line without success. The Finns counter-attacked, and the Soviets retreated to a new defensive line where they stayed for the rest of the war.

To the north was Finland&#x27;s only ice-free port in the Arctic, Petsamo. The Finns lacked the manpower to defend it fully, as the main front was distant at the Karelian Isthmus. In the battle of Petsamo, the Soviet 104th Division attacked the Finnish 104th Independent Cover Company. The Finns abandoned Petsamo and concentrated on delaying actions. The area was treeless, windy, and relatively low, offering little defensible terrain. The almost constant darkness and extreme temperatures of the Lapland winter benefited the Finns, who executed guerrilla attacks against Soviet supply lines and patrols. As a result, the Soviet movements were halted by the efforts of one-fifth as many Finns.

==Aerial warfare==
===Soviet Air Force===
The USSR enjoyed air superiority throughout the war. The Soviet Air Force, supporting the Red Army&#x27;s invasion with about 2,500 aircraft (the most common type being Tupolev SB), was not as effective as the Soviets might have hoped. The material damage by the bomb raids was slight as Finland offered few valuable targets for strategic bombing. For example, the city of Tampere was one of the most important targets because it was an important railway junction, and also housed State Aircraft Factory and the Tampere Linen and Iron Industry premises, which manufactured munitions and weapons, including grenade launchers. Often, targets were village depots with little value. The country had few modern highways in the interior, therefore making the railways the main targets for bombers. Rail tracks were cut thousands of times but the Finns hastily repaired them and service resumed within a matter of hours. The Soviet Air Force learned from its early mistakes, and by late February instituted more effective tactics.

The largest bombing raid against the capital of Finland, Helsinki, occurred on the first day of the war. The capital was bombed only a few times thereafter. All in all, Soviet bombings cost Finland five per cent of its total man-hour production. Nevertheless, Soviet air attacks affected thousands of civilians, killing 957. The Soviets recorded 2,075 bombing attacks in 516 localities. The city of Viipuri, a major Soviet objective close to the Karelian Isthmus front, was almost levelled by nearly 12,000 bombs. No attacks on civilian targets were mentioned in Soviet radio or newspaper reports. In January 1940, the Soviet &quot;Pravda&quot; newspaper continued to lie that no civilian targets in Finland had been struck, even accidentally. It is estimated that the Soviet air force lost about 400 aircraft because of inclement weather, lack of fuel and tools, and during transport to the front. The Soviet Air Force flew approximately 44,000 sorties during the war.

===Finnish Air Force===
At the beginning of the war, Finland had a small air force, with only 114 combat planes fit for duty. Missions were limited, and fighter aircraft were mainly used to repel Soviet bombers. Strategic bombings doubled as opportunities for military reconnaissance. Old-fashioned and few in number, aircraft offered little support for Finnish ground troops. In spite of losses, the number of planes in the Finnish Air Force rose by over 50 per cent by the end of the war. The Finns received shipments of British, French, Italian, Swedish and American aircraft.

Finnish fighter pilots often flew their motley collection of planes into Soviet formations that outnumbered them 10 or even 20 times. Finnish fighters shot down 200 Soviet aircraft, while losing 62 of their own on all causes. Finnish anti-aircraft guns downed more than 300 enemy aircraft. Often, a Finnish forward air base consisted of a frozen lake, a windsock, a telephone set and some tents. Air-raid warnings were given by Finnish women organised by the Lotta Svärd. The top scoring fighter ace was Jorma Sarvanto, with 12.83 victories. He would increase his tally during the Continuation War.

==Naval warfare==
===Naval activity===
There was little naval activity during the Winter War. The Baltic Sea began to freeze over by the end of December, impeding the movement of warships; by mid-winter, only ice breakers and submarines could still move. The other reason for low naval activity was the nature of Soviet Navy forces in the area. The Baltic Fleet was a coastal defence force which did not have the training, logistical structure, or landing craft to undertake large-scale operations. The Baltic Fleet possessed two battleships, one heavy cruiser, almost 20 destroyers, 50 motor torpedo boats, 52 submarines, and other miscellaneous vessels. The Soviets used naval bases in Paldiski, Tallinn and Liepāja for their operations.

The Finnish Navy was a coastal defence force with two coastal defence ships, five submarines, four gunboats, seven motor torpedo boats, one minelayer and six minesweepers and at least 5 icebreakers. The two coastal defence ships, and , were moved to harbour in Turku where they were used to bolster the air defence. Their anti-aircraft guns shot down one or two planes over the city, and the ships remained there for the rest of the war. At 18 January, Finnish armed icebreaker &quot;Tarmo&quot; was severely damaged at Kotka, received 2 bombs from a Soviet bomber with 39 Finnish troops killed in action. As well as coastal defence, the Finnish Navy protected the Ålandish and Finnish merchant vessels in the Baltic Sea.

Soviet aircraft bombed Finnish vessels and harbours and dropped mines into Finnish seaways. Still, only five merchant ships were lost to Soviet action. World War II, which had started before the Winter War, proved more costly for the Finnish merchant vessels, with 26 lost due to hostile action in 1939 and 1940.

===Coastal artillery===
Finnish coastal artillery batteries defended important harbours and naval bases. Most batteries were left over from the Imperial Russian period, with guns being the most numerous. Finland attempted to modernise its old guns and installed a number of new batteries, the largest of which featured a gun battery on the island of Kuivasaari in front of Helsinki, originally intended to block the Gulf of Finland to Soviet ships with the help of batteries on the Estonian side.

The first naval battle occurred in the Gulf of Finland on 1 December, near the island of Russarö, south of Hanko. That day, the weather was fair and visibility was excellent. The Finns spotted the Soviet cruiser and two destroyers. When the ships were at a range of , the Finns opened fire with four coastal guns. After five minutes of firing by the coastal guns, the cruiser had been damaged by near misses and retreated. The destroyers remained undamaged, but the &quot;Kirov&quot; suffered 17 dead and 30 wounded. The Soviets already knew the locations of the Finnish coastal batteries, but were surprised by their range.

Coastal artillery had a greater effect on land by reinforcing defence in conjunction with army artillery. Two sets of fortress artillery made significant contributions to the early battles on the Karelian Isthmus and in Ladoga Karelia. These were located at Kaarnajoki on the Eastern Isthmus and at Mantsi on the northeastern shore of Lake Ladoga. The fortress of Koivisto provided similar support from the southwestern coast of the Isthmus.

==Soviet breakthrough in February==
===Red Army reforms and offensive preparations===
Joseph Stalin was not pleased with the results of December 1939 in the Finnish campaign. The Red Army had been humiliated in defeats by smaller Finnish forces. By the third week of the war, Soviet propaganda was already working to explain the failures of the Soviet military to the populace: blaming bad terrain and harsh climate, and falsely claiming that the Mannerheim Line was stronger than the Maginot Line, and that the Americans had sent 1,000 of their best pilots to Finland. However, the Soviets were confronted with the unavoidable reality of the poor performance of their troops against the Finns. Stalin in particular was concerned about the effects of the war on Soviet reputation. In late December, the Soviets decided to reduce their strategic objectives and focused on bringing the war to an end.

Chief of Staff Boris Shaposhnikov was given full authority over operations in the Finnish theatre, and he ordered the suspension of frontal assaults in late December. Kliment Voroshilov was replaced with Semyon Timoshenko as the commander of the Soviet forces in the war on 7 January 1940. The main focus of the Soviet attack was switched to the Karelian Isthmus. Timoshenko and Zhdanov reorganised and tightened control between different branches of service in the Red Army. They also changed tactical doctrines to meet the realities of the situation.

The Soviet forces on the Karelian Isthmus were divided into two armies: the 7th and the 13th Army. The 7th Army, now under Kirill Meretskov, would concentrate 75 per cent of its strength against the stretch of the Mannerheim Line between Taipale and the Munasuo swamp. Tactics would be basic: an armoured wedge for the initial breakthrough, followed by the main infantry and vehicle assault force. The Red Army would prepare by pinpointing the Finnish frontline fortifications. The 123rd Rifle Division then rehearsed the assault on life-size mock-ups. The Soviets shipped large numbers of new tanks and artillery pieces to the theatre. Troops were increased from ten divisions to 25–26 divisions with six or seven tank brigades and several independent tank platoons as support, totalling 600,000 soldiers. On 1 February, the Red Army began a large offensive, firing 300,000 shells into the Finnish line in the first 24 hours of the bombardment.

===Soviet offensive on the Karelian Isthmus===
Although the Karelian Isthmus front was less active in January than in December, the Soviets increased bombardments, wearing down the defenders and softening their fortifications. During daylight hours, the Finns took shelter inside their fortifications from the bombardments and repaired damage during the night. The situation led quickly to war exhaustion among the Finns, who lost over 3,000 soldiers in trench warfare. The Soviets also made occasional small infantry assaults with one or two companies. Because of the shortage of ammunition, Finnish artillery emplacements were under orders to fire only against directly threatening ground attacks. On 1 February, the Soviets further escalated their artillery and air bombardments.

Although the Soviets refined their tactics and morale improved, the generals were still willing to accept massive losses to reach their objectives. Soviet attacks were now being screened by smoke, heavy artillery, and armour support, but the infantry charged in the open and in dense formations. Unlike their tactics in December, Soviet tanks advanced in smaller numbers. The Finns could not easily eliminate tanks if infantry troops protected them. After 10 days of constant artillery barrage, the Soviets achieved a breakthrough on the Western Karelian Isthmus in the Second Battle of Summa.

By 11 February, the Soviets had approximately 460,000 soldiers, 3,350 artillery pieces, 3,000 tanks and 1,300 aircraft deployed on the Karelian Isthmus. The Red Army was constantly receiving new recruits after the breakthrough. Opposing them, the Finns had eight divisions, totalling about 150,000 soldiers. One by one, the defenders&#x27; strongholds crumbled under the Soviet attacks and the Finns were forced to retreat. On 15 February, Mannerheim authorised a general retreat of the II Corps to a fallback line of defence. On the eastern side of the isthmus, the Finns continued to resist Soviet assaults, achieving a stalemate in the battle of Taipale.

===Peace negotiations===
Although the Finns attempted to re-open negotiations with Moscow by every means during the war, the Soviets did not respond. In early January, Finnish communist Hella Wuolijoki contacted the Finnish Government. She offered to contact Moscow through the Soviet Union&#x27;s ambassador to Sweden, Alexandra Kollontai. Wuolijoki departed for Stockholm and met Kollontai secretly at a hotel. On 29 January, Molotov put an end to the puppet Terijoki Government and recognized the Ryti–Tanner government as the legal government of Finland, informing it that the USSR was willing to negotiate peace.

By mid-February, it became clear that the Finnish forces were rapidly approaching exhaustion. For the Soviets, casualties were high, the situation was a source of political embarrassment to the Soviet regime, and there was a risk of Franco-British intervention (which was overestimated by Soviet intelligence in February and March 1940). With the spring thaw approaching, the Soviet forces risked becoming bogged down in the forests. Finnish Foreign Minister Väinö Tanner arrived in Stockholm on 12 February and negotiated the peace terms with the Soviets through the Swedes. German representatives, not aware that the negotiations were underway, suggested on 17 February that Finland negotiate with the Soviet Union.

Both Germany and Sweden were keen to see an end to the Winter War. The Germans feared losing the iron ore fields in Northern Sweden and threatened to attack at once if the Swedes granted the Allied forces right of passage. The German invasion plan, named &quot;Studie Nord&quot;, was later implemented as Operation Weserübung. Leon Trotsky opined after the war that Hitler would view a Soviet occupation of Finland as a threat to this plan. Any potential German plans for bases in Finland would also be thwarted if the Soviets occupied Finland, though Trotsky himself believed that Hitler was not interested in occupying Finland, but rather its role as a buffer between Germany and the USSR.

As the Finnish Cabinet hesitated in the face of harsh Soviet conditions, Sweden&#x27;s King Gustav V made a public statement on 19 February in which he confirmed having declined Finnish pleas for support from Swedish troops. On 25 February, the Soviet peace terms were spelt out in detail. On 29 February, the Finnish Government accepted the Soviet terms in principle and was willing to enter into negotiations. Red Army commanders wished to continue the war as their forces were starting to make progress against the Finns, whereas the Communist Party pointed out that the war was becoming too costly and called for the signing of a peace treaty. The party believed that Finland could be taken over later by means of a revolution. The heated discussion that ensued failed to yield any clear result and the matter went to a vote, in which the party&#x27;s opinion prevailed and the decision was taken to bring hostilities to an end.

===End of war in March===
On 5 March, the Red Army advanced past the Mannerheim Line and entered the suburbs of Viipuri. The same day, the Red Army established a beachhead on the Western Gulf of Viipuri. The Finns proposed an armistice on 6 March, but the Soviets, wanting to keep the pressure on the Finnish government, declined the offer. The Finnish peace delegation travelled to Moscow via Stockholm and arrived on 7 March. They were disappointed to find that Stalin was not present during peace negotiations, likely due to the Red Army&#x27;s humiliation by the Finns. The Soviets had further demands, as their military position was strong and improving. On 9 March, the Finnish military situation on the Karelian Isthmus was dire, as troops were experiencing heavy casualties. Artillery ammunition was exhausted and weapons were wearing out. The Finnish government, realizing that the hoped-for Franco-British military expedition would not arrive in time, as Norway and Sweden had not given the Allies right of passage, had little choice but to accept the Soviet terms. Finnish President Kyösti Kallio resisted the idea of giving up any territory to the Soviet Union, but eventually agreed to sign the Moscow Peace Treaty. When he signed the document, the tormented president uttered the well-known words: &quot;Let the hand wither that signs this monstrous treaty!&quot;

===Moscow Peace Treaty===

The Moscow Peace Treaty was signed in Moscow on 12 March 1940. A cease-fire took effect the next day at noon Leningrad time, 11 a.m. Helsinki time. With it, Finland ceded the Karelian Isthmus and most of Ladoga Karelia. The area included Viipuri (Finland&#x27;s second-largest city [Population Register] or fourth-largest city [Church and Civil Register], depending on the census data), much of Finland&#x27;s industrialised territory, and significant land still held by Finland&#x27;s militaryall in all, nine per cent of Finnish territory. The ceded territory included 13 per cent of Finland&#x27;s economic assets. 12 per cent of Finland&#x27;s population, 422,000 to 450,000 Karelians, were evacuated and lost their homes. Finland also ceded a part of the region of Salla, the Rybachy Peninsula in the Barents Sea, and four islands in the Gulf of Finland. The Hanko peninsula was leased to the Soviet Union as a military base for 30 years. The region of Petsamo, captured by the Red Army during the war, was returned to Finland according to the treaty.

Finnish concessions and territorial losses exceeded Soviet pre-war demands. Before the war, the Soviet Union demanded for the frontier with Finland on the Karelian Isthmus to be moved westward to a point east of Viipuri to the line between Koivisto and Lipola; for existing fortifications on the Karelian Isthmus to be demolished and for the islands of Suursaari, Tytärsaari, and Koivisto in the Gulf of Finland and Rybachy Peninsula to be ceded. In exchange, the Soviet Union proposed to cede Repola and Porajärvi from Eastern Karelia, an area twice as large as the territories that were originally demanded from the Finns.

==Foreign support==
===Foreign volunteers===
World opinion largely supported the Finnish cause, and the Soviet aggression was generally deemed unjustified. World War II had not yet directly affected France, the United Kingdom or the United States; the Winter War was practically the only conflict in Europe at that time and thus held major world interest. Several foreign organisations sent material aid, and many countries granted credit and military materiel to Finland. Nazi Germany allowed arms to pass through its territory to Finland, but after a Swedish newspaper made this public, Adolf Hitler initiated a policy of silence towards Finland, as part of improved German–Soviet relations following the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact.

The largest foreign contingent came from neighboring Sweden, which provided nearly 8,760 volunteers during the war. The Volunteer Corps was formed of predominantly Swedes, as well as 1,010 Danes and 727 Norwegians. They fought on the northern front at Salla during the last days of the war. A Swedish unit of Gloster Gladiator fighters, named &quot;the Flight Regiment 19&quot; also participated. Swedish anti-air batteries with Bofors guns were responsible for air defence in northern Finland and the city of Turku. Volunteers arrived from Hungary, Italy and Estonia. 350 American nationals of Finnish background volunteered, and 210 volunteers of other nationalities arrived in Finland before the war ended. Max Manus, a Norwegian, fought in the Winter War before returning to Norway and later achieved fame as a resistance fighter during the German occupation of Norway. In total, Finland received 12,000 volunteers, 50 of whom died during the war. The British actor Christopher Lee volunteered in the war for two weeks, but did not face combat.

==== White émigrés and Russian prisoners-of-war ====
Finland officially refused overtures from the anti-Soviet Russian All-Military Union (ROVS) for aid. Nevertheless, Mannerheim eventually agreed to establish a small Russian detachment (&quot;Russkaya narodnaya armiya&quot;, RNA) of 200 men after being introduced to Boris Bazhanov, a high-ranking ROVS member, in person in January 1940. The project was deemed top secret, and was under the auspices of the intelligence division of the Finnish army headquarters.

The ranks of RNA were to be filled by prisoners-of-war, but it would be commanded by White émigrés instead of captured Soviet Army officers, who were deemed unreliable. Bazhanov&#x27;s Finnish assistant Feodor Schulgin chose Captain Vladimir Kiseleff, Lieutenant Vladimir Lugovskoy, Anatoly Budyansky and brothers Nikolay and Vladimir Bastamov as officers for the unit. Of the five, the Bastamovs were not Finnish citizens, but had Nansen passports. The prisoners-of-war were trained in Huittinen, although it is possible that some were also trained in Lempäälä.

RNA never participated in battle, despite Boris Bazhanov&#x27;s later claims to the contrary in his memoirs. About 35 to 40 members of it were present during a battle in Ruskeala in early March 1940, where they spread flyers and broadcast propaganda to encircled Soviet troops, but did not carry weapons. The men were subsequently detained by Finnish forces, who mistook them for Soviet infiltrators. After the war&#x27;s end, Bazhanov was immediately asked to leave Finland, which he did. Finnish military historian Carl Geust presumes that most members of the RNA were executed after they were returned to the Soviet Union after the war. Additionally, Vladimir Bastamov was later extradited into the Soviet Union as one of the Leino prisoners in 1945, and was sentenced to 20 years of hard labour. He was released after Stalin&#x27;s death and returned to Finland in 1956.

===Franco-British intervention plans===

France had been one of the earliest supporters of Finland during the Winter War. The French saw an opportunity to weaken Germany&#x27;s resource imports via a Finnish counteroffensive, as both Sweden and the Soviet Union were strategic trading partners to Germany. France had another motive, preferring to have a major war in a remote part of Europe rather than on French soil. France planned to re‑arm the Polish exile units and transport them to the Finnish Arctic port of Petsamo. Another proposal was a massive air strike with Turkish co-operation against the Caucasus oil fields.

The British, for their part, wanted to block the flow of iron ore from Swedish mines to Germany as the Swedes supplied up to 40 per cent of Germany&#x27;s iron demand. The matter was raised by British Admiral Reginald Plunkett on 18 September 1939, and the next day Winston Churchill brought up the subject in the Chamberlain War Cabinet. On 11 December, Churchill opined that the British should gain a foothold in Scandinavia with the objective to help the Finns, but without a war with the Soviet Union. Because of the heavy German reliance on Northern Sweden&#x27;s iron ore, Hitler had made it clear to the Swedish government in December that any Allied troops on Swedish soil would immediately provoke a German invasion.

On 19 December, French Prime Minister Édouard Daladier introduced his plan to the General Staff and the War Cabinet. In his plan, Daladier created linkage between the war in Finland and the iron ore in Sweden. There was a danger of Finland&#x27;s possible fall under Soviet hegemony. In turn, Nazi Germany could occupy both Norway and Sweden. These two powers could divide Scandinavia between them, as they had already done with Poland. The main motivation of the French and the British was to reduce German war-making ability.

The Military Co-ordination Committee met on 20 December in London, and two days later the French plan was put forward. The Anglo-French Supreme War Council elected to send notes to Norway and Sweden on 27 December, urging the Norwegians and Swedes to help Finland and offer the Allies their support. Norway and Sweden rejected the offer on 5 January 1940. The Allies came up with a new plan, in which they would demand that Norway and Sweden give them right of passage by citing a League of Nations resolution as justification. The expedition troops would disembark at the Norwegian port of Narvik and proceed by rail toward Finland, passing through the Swedish ore fields on the way. This demand was sent to Norway and Sweden on 6 January, but it was likewise rejected six days later.

Stymied but not yet dissuaded from the possibility of action, the Allies formulated a final plan on 29 January. First, the Finns would make a formal request for assistance. Then, the Allies would ask Norway and Sweden for permission to move the &quot;volunteers&quot; across their territory. Finally, to protect the supply line from German actions, the Allies would send units ashore at Namsos, Bergen, and Trondheim. The operation would have required 100,000 British and 35,000 French soldiers with naval and air support. The supply convoys would sail on 12 March and the landings would begin on 20 March. The end of the war on 13 March cancelled Franco-British plans to send troops to Finland through Northern Scandinavia.

==Aftermath and casualties==

===Finland===
The 105-day war had a profound and depressing effect in Finland. Meaningful international support was minimal and arrived late, and the German blockade had prevented most armament shipments. The 15-month period between the Winter War and Operation Barbarossa, part of which was the Continuation War, was later called the Interim Peace. After the end of the war, the situation of the Finnish Army on the Karelian Isthmus became a subject of debate in Finland. Orders had already been issued to prepare a retreat to the next line of defence in the Taipale sector. Estimates of how long the Red Army could have been delayed by retreat-and-stand operations varied from a few days to a few weeks, or to a couple of months at most.

Immediately after the war, Helsinki officially announced 19,576 dead. According to revised estimates in 2005 by Finnish historians, 25,904 people died or went missing and 43,557 were wounded on the Finnish side during the war. Finnish and Russian researchers have estimated that there were 800–1,100 Finnish prisoners of war, of whom between 10 and 20 per cent died. The Soviet Union repatriated 847 Finns after the War. Air raids killed 957 civilians. Between 20 and 30 tanks were destroyed and 62 aircraft were lost. Also, Finland had to cede all ships of the Finnish Ladoga Naval Detachment to the Soviet Union by virtue of the Moscow Peace Treaty.

During the Interim Peace, Finland aimed to improve its defensive capabilities and conducted negotiations with Sweden on a military alliance, but negotiations ended once it became clear that both Germany and the Soviet Union opposed such an alliance. On 31 July 1940, German Chancellor Adolf Hitler gave the order to plan an assault on the Soviet Union and so Germany had to reassess its position regarding Finland. Until then, Germany had rejected Finnish appeals to purchase arms. However, the prospect of an invasion of the Soviet Union reversed the policy. In August, the secret sale of weapons to Finland was permitted.

Karelian evacuees established an interest group, the Finnish Karelian League, to defend Karelian rights and interests and to find a way to return ceded regions of Karelia to Finland. Finland wished to re-enter the war mainly because of the Soviet invasion of Finland during the Winter War, which had taken place after Finland had failed by relying on the League of Nations and on Nordic neutrality. Finland aimed primarily to reverse its territorial losses from the Moscow Peace Treaty and, depending on the success of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, possibly to expand its borders, especially into East Karelia. Some right-wing groups, such as the Academic Karelia Society, supported a Greater Finland ideology. The Continuation War began in June 1941 and led to Finnish participation in the Siege of Leningrad as well as the Finnish occupation of East Karelia.

===Soviet Union===
The Soviet General Staff Supreme Command (&quot;Stavka&quot;) met in April 1940, reviewed the lessons of the Finnish campaign and recommended reforms. The role of frontline political commissars was reduced, and old-fashioned ranks and forms of discipline were reintroduced. Clothing, equipment and tactics for winter operations were improved. Not all of the reforms had been completed when Germans initiated Operation Barbarossa 14 months later.

Between the Winter War and &quot;perestroika&quot; in the late 1980s, Soviet historiography relied solely on Molotov&#x27;s speeches on the Winter War. In his radio speech of 29 November 1939, Molotov argued that the Soviet Union had tried to negotiate guarantees of security for Leningrad for two months. The Finns had taken a hostile stance to &quot;please foreign imperialists&quot;. Finland had undertaken military provocation, and the Soviet Union could no longer abide by the non-aggression pacts. According to Molotov, the Soviet Union did not want to occupy or annex Finland, but the goal was purely to secure Leningrad.

The official Soviet figure, with reference to the command of the Leningrad Military District, was published at a session of the Supreme Soviet on 26 March 1940, with 48,475 dead and 158,863 sick and wounded. More recent Russian estimates vary: in 1990, Mikhail Semiryaga claimed 53,522 dead, and N. I. Baryshnikov, 53,500. In 1997, Grigoriy Krivosheyev claimed 126,875 dead and missing and total casualties of 391,783, with 188,671 wounded. In 1991, Yuri Kilin claimed 63,990 dead and total casualties of 271,528. In 2007, he revised the estimate of dead to 134,000 and in 2012, he updated the estimate to 138,533. In 2013, Pavel Petrov stated that the Russian State Military Archive has a database confirming 167,976 killed or missing along with the soldiers&#x27; names, dates of birth and ranks. Nikita Khrushchev stated in his memoirs that over one million Soviet soldiers were killed.

There were 5,572 Soviet prisoners of war in Finland. After the Winter War, the Soviet prisoners were returned to the USSR in accordance with the Moscow Peace Treaty. Of these, 450 were released, 4,354 were sentenced to imprisonment in labour camps ranging from 3 to 10 years and 414 were exposed to be &quot;active in traitorous activities while in captivity&quot;, with 334 criminal cases being transferred to the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union; 232 of those cases ended in a death penalty.

Between 1,200 and 3,543 Soviet tanks were destroyed. The official figure was 611 tank casualties, but Yuri Kilin found a note received by the head of the Soviet General Staff, Boris Shaposhnikov, reporting 3,543 tank casualties and 316 tanks destroyed. According to Finnish historian Ohto Manninen, the 7th Soviet Army lost 1,244 tanks during the breakthrough battles of the Mannerheim Line in mid-winter. In the immediate aftermath of the war, the Finnish estimate of the number of lost Soviet tanks was 1,000 to 1,200. The Soviet Air Forces lost around 1,000 aircraft, but fewer than half of them were combat casualties. According to Carl Fredrik Geust, based on the studies of Soviet air force units, Finnish anti-aircraft units shot down 119 and Finnish fighter pilots 131 Soviet aircraft, though all Soviet aircraft losses had been more than 900.

===Germany===
The Winter War was a political success for the Germans. Both the Red Army and the League of Nations were humiliated, and the Anglo-French Supreme War Council had been revealed to be chaotic and powerless. The German policy of neutrality was unpopular in the homeland, and relations with Italy had suffered. After the Moscow Peace Treaty, Germany improved its ties with Finland, and within two weeks, Finnish-German relations were at the top of the agenda. More importantly, the very poor performance of the Red Army convinced Hitler that an invasion of the Soviet Union would be successful. In June 1941, Hitler declared, &quot;we have only to kick in the door and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down&quot;.

===Allies===
The Winter War laid bare the disorganisation and ineffectiveness of the Red Army and that of the Allies. The Anglo-French Supreme War Council was unable to formulate a workable plan, revealing its unsuitability to make effective war in either Britain or France. This failure led to the collapse of the Third Daladier Government in France and the nomination of Paul Reynaud as the new Prime Minister of France.

<text>William Wordsworth (7 April 177023 April 1850) was an English Romantic poet who, with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, helped to launch the Romantic Age in English literature with their joint publication &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot; (1798).

Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot; is generally considered to be &quot;The Prelude&quot;, a semi-autobiographical poem of his early years that he revised and expanded a number of times. It was posthumously titled and published by his wife in the year of his death, before which it was generally known as &quot;The Poem to Coleridge&quot;.

Wordsworth was Poet Laureate from 1843 until his death from pleurisy on 23 April 1850. He remains one of the most recognizable names in English poetry and was a key figure of the Romantic poets.

==Early life==
=== Family and education ===
The second of five children born to John Wordsworth and Ann Cookson, William Wordsworth was born on 7 April 1770 in what is now named Wordsworth House in Cockermouth, Cumberland (now in Cumbria), part of the scenic region in northwestern England known as the Lake District. William&#x27;s sister, the poet and diarist Dorothy Wordsworth, to whom he was close all his life, was born the following year, and the two were baptised together. They had three other siblings: Richard, the eldest, who became a lawyer; John Wordsworth, born after Dorothy, who went to sea and died in 1805 when the ship of which he was captain, the &quot;Earl of Abergavenny&quot;, was wrecked off the south coast of England; and Christopher, the youngest, who entered the Church and rose to be Master of Trinity College, Cambridge.

Wordsworth&#x27;s father was a legal representative of James Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale and, through his connections, lived in a large mansion in the small town. He was frequently away from home on business, so the young William and his siblings had little involvement with him and remained distant until he died in 1783. However, he did encourage William in his reading, and in particular, set him to commit large portions of verse to memory, including works by Milton, Shakespeare and Spenser which William would pore over in his father&#x27;s library. William also spent time at his mother&#x27;s parents&#x27; house in Penrith, Cumberland, where he was exposed to the moors but did not get along with his grandparents or uncle, who also lived there. His hostile interactions with them distressed him to the point of contemplating suicide.

Wordsworth was taught to read by his mother, and he first attended a tiny school of low quality in Cockermouth, then a school in Penrith for the children of upper-class families. He was taught there by Ann Birkett, who instilled in her students traditions that included pursuing scholarly and local activities, especially the festivals around Easter, May Day and Shrove Tuesday. Wordsworth was taught both the Bible and the &quot;Spectator&quot;, but little else. At the school in Penrith, he met the Hutchinsons, including Mary Hutchinson, who later became his wife.

After the death of Wordsworth&#x27;s mother, in 1778, his father sent him to Hawkshead Grammar School in Lancashire (now in Cumbria) and sent Dorothy to live with relatives in Yorkshire. She and William did not meet again for nine years.

Wordsworth debuted as a writer in 1787 when he published a sonnet in &quot;The European Magazine&quot;. That same year he began attending St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He received his BA degree in 1791. He returned to Hawkshead for the first two summers of his time at Cambridge and often spent later holidays on walking tours, visiting places famous for the beauty of their landscape. In 1790, he went on a walking tour of Europe, during which he toured the Alps extensively and visited nearby areas of France, Switzerland, and Italy.

===Relationship with Annette Vallon===
In November 1791, Wordsworth visited Revolutionary France and became enchanted with the Republican movement. He fell in love with a French woman, Annette Vallon, who, in 1792, gave birth to their daughter Caroline. Financial problems and Britain&#x27;s tense relations with France forced him to return to England alone the following year. The circumstances of his return and subsequent behaviour raised doubts about his declared wish to marry Annette. However, he supported her and his daughter as best he could in later life. The Reign of Terror left Wordsworth thoroughly disillusioned with the French Revolution, and the outbreak of armed hostilities between Britain and France prevented him from seeing Annette and his daughter for some years.
With the Peace of Amiens again allowing travel to France, in 1802, Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy visited Annette and Caroline in Calais. The purpose of the visit was to prepare Annette for the fact of his forthcoming marriage to Mary Hutchinson. Afterwards, he wrote the sonnet &quot;It is a beauteous evening, calm and free&quot;, recalling a seaside walk with the nine-year-old Caroline, whom he had never seen before that visit. Mary was anxious that Wordsworth should do more for Caroline. Upon Caroline&#x27;s marriage, in 1816, Wordsworth settled £30 a year on her (equivalent to £ in 2021), payments which continued until 1835, when they were replaced by a capital settlement.

== Early career == 
===First publication and &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot;=== 
 The year 1793 saw the first publication of poems by Wordsworth in the collections &quot;An Evening Walk&quot; and &quot;Descriptive Sketches&quot;. In 1795, he received a legacy of £900 from Raisley Calvert and was able to pursue a career as a poet.

It was also in 1795 that he met Samuel Taylor Coleridge in Somerset. The two poets quickly developed a close friendship. For two years from 1795, William and his sister Dorothy lived at Racedown House in Dorset—a property of the Pinney family—to the west of Pilsdon Pen. They walked in the area for about two hours daily, and the nearby hills consoled Dorothy as she pined for the fells of her native Lakeland. She wrote,
&quot;We have hills which, seen from a distance, almost take the character of mountains, some cultivated nearly to their summits, others in their wild state covered with furze and broom. These delight me the most as they remind me of our native wilds.&quot;

In 1797, the pair moved to Alfoxton House, Somerset, just a few miles away from Coleridge&#x27;s home in Nether Stowey. Together Wordsworth and Coleridge (with insights from Dorothy) produced &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot; (1798), an important work in the English Romantic movement. The volume gave neither Wordsworth&#x27;s nor Coleridge&#x27;s name as author. One of Wordsworth&#x27;s most famous poems, &quot;Tintern Abbey&quot;, was published in this collection, along with Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;. The second edition, published in 1800, had only Wordsworth listed as the author and included a preface to the poems. It was augmented significantly in the next edition, published in 1802. In this preface, which some scholars consider a central work of Romantic literary theory, Wordsworth discusses what he sees as the elements of a new type of verse, one that is based on the ordinary language &quot;really used by men&quot; while avoiding the poetic diction of much 18th-century verse. Wordsworth also gives his famous definition of poetry as &quot;the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility&quot;, and calls his own poems in the book &quot;experimental&quot;. A fourth and final edition of &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot; was published in 1805.

===&quot;The Borderers&quot;===
Between 1795 and 1797, Wordsworth wrote his only play, &quot;The Borderers&quot;, a verse tragedy set during the reign of King Henry III of England, when Englishmen in the North Country came into conflict with Scottish border reivers. He attempted to get the play staged in November 1797. However, it was rejected by Thomas Harris, the manager of the Covent Garden Theatre, who proclaimed it &quot;impossible that the play should succeed in the representation&quot;. The rebuff was not received lightly by Wordsworth, and the play was not published until 1842, after substantial revisions.

==Germany and move to the Lake District==

Wordsworth, Dorothy, and Coleridge travelled to Germany in the autumn of 1798. While Coleridge was intellectually stimulated by the journey, its main effect on Wordsworth was to produce homesickness. During the harsh winter of 1798–99, Wordsworth lived with Dorothy in Goslar, and, despite extreme stress and loneliness, began work on the autobiographical piece that was later titled &quot;The Prelude&quot;. He wrote several other famous poems in Goslar, including &quot;The Lucy poems&quot;. In the Autumn of 1799, Wordsworth and his sister returned to England and visited the Hutchinson family at Sockburn. When Coleridge arrived back in England, he travelled to the North with their publisher, Joseph Cottle, to meet Wordsworth and undertake a proposed tour of the Lake District. This was the immediate cause of the brother and sister&#x27;s settling at Dove Cottage in Grasmere in the Lake District, this time with another poet, Robert Southey, nearby. Wordsworth, Coleridge and Southey came to be known as the &quot;Lake Poets&quot;. Throughout this period, many of Wordsworth&#x27;s poems revolved around themes of death, endurance, separation and grief.

==Married life==

In 1802, Lowther&#x27;s heir, William Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale, paid the £4,000 () owed to Wordsworth&#x27;s father through Lowther&#x27;s failure to pay his aide. It was this repayment that afforded Wordsworth the financial means to marry. On 4 October, following his visit with Dorothy to France to arrange matters with Annette, Wordsworth married his childhood friend, Mary Hutchinson, at All Saints&#x27; Church, Brompton. Dorothy continued to live with the couple and grew close to Mary. The following year, Mary gave birth to the first of five children, three of whom predeceased her and William:
* Rev. John Wordsworth MA (18 June 180325 July 1875). Vicar of Brigham, Cumberland and Rector of Plumbland, Cumberland. Buried at Highgate Cemetery (west side). Married four times:
*# Isabella Curwen (died 1848) had six children: Jane Stanley, Henry, William, John, Charles and Edward.
*## Jane Stanley (1833–1912), who married the Rev. Bennet Sherard Kennedy (an illegitimate son of Robert Sherard, 6th Earl of Harborough) and their son Robert Harborough Sherard became first biographer to his friend, Oscar Wilde.
*# Helen Ross (died 1854). No children.
*# Mary Ann Dolan (died after 1858) had one daughter Dora.
*## Dora Wordsworth (1858–1934)
*# Mary Gamble. No children.
* Dora Wordsworth (16 August 18049 July 1847). Married Edward Quillinan in 1841.
* Thomas Wordsworth (15 June 18061 December 1812).
* Catherine Wordsworth (6 September 18084 June 1812).
* William &quot;Willy&quot; Wordsworth (12 May 18101883). He married Fanny Graham and had four children: Mary Louisa, William, Reginald, and Gordon.

== Later career ==
===Autobiographical work and &quot;Poems, in Two Volumes&quot;===
Wordsworth had for years been making plans to write a long philosophical poem in three parts, which he intended to call &quot;The Recluse&quot;. In 1798–99 he started an autobiographical poem, which he referred to as the &quot;poem to Coleridge&quot; and which he planned would serve as an appendix to a larger work called &quot;The Recluse&quot;. In 1804, he began expanding this autobiographical work, having decided to make it a prologue rather than an appendix. He completed this work, now generally referred to as the first version of &quot;The Prelude&quot;, in 1805, but refused to publish such a personal work until he had completed the whole of &quot;The Recluse&quot;. The death of his brother John, also in 1805, affected him strongly and may have influenced his decisions about these works.

Wordsworth&#x27;s philosophical allegiances, as articulated in &quot;The Prelude&quot; and in such shorter works as &quot;Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey&quot; have been a source of critical debate. It was long supposed that Wordsworth relied chiefly on Coleridge for philosophical guidance. However, scholars have recently suggested that Wordsworth&#x27;s ideas may have been formed years before he and Coleridge became friends in the mid-1790s. In particular, while he was in revolutionary Paris in 1792, the 22-year-old Wordsworth met the mysterious traveller John &quot;Walking&quot; Stewart (1747–1822), who was nearing the end of his thirty years of wandering, on foot, from Madras, India, through Persia and Arabia, across Africa and Europe, and up through the fledgling United States. By the time of their association, Stewart had published an ambitious work of original materialist philosophy entitled &quot;The Apocalypse of Nature&quot; (London, 1791), to which many of Wordsworth&#x27;s philosophical sentiments may well be indebted.

In 1807, Wordsworth published &quot;Poems, in Two Volumes&quot;, including &quot;&quot;. Until now, Wordsworth was known only for &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot;, and he hoped this new collection would cement his reputation. Its reception was lukewarm.

In 1810, Wordsworth and Coleridge were estranged over the latter&#x27;s opium addiction, and in 1812, his son Thomas died at the age of 6, six months after the death of 3-year-old Catherine. The following year, he received an appointment as Distributor of Stamps for Westmorland, and the stipend of £400 a year made him financially secure, albeit at the cost of political independence. In 1813, he and his family, including Dorothy, moved to Rydal Mount, Ambleside (between Grasmere and Rydal Water), where he spent the rest of his life.

===The Prospectus===
In 1814, Wordsworth published &quot;The Excursion&quot; as the second part of the three-part work &quot;The Recluse&quot; even though he never completed the first or third parts. He did, however, write a poetic Prospectus to &quot;The Recluse&quot; in which he laid out the structure and intention of the whole work. The Prospectus contains some of Wordsworth&#x27;s most famous lines on the relation between the human mind and nature:

Some modern critics suggest that there was a decline in his work beginning around the mid-1810s, perhaps because most of the concerns that characterised his early poems (loss, death, endurance, separation and abandonment) had been resolved in his writings and his life. By 1820, he was enjoying considerable success accompanying a reversal in the contemporary critical opinion of his earlier works.

The poet and artist William Blake, who knew Wordsworth&#x27;s work, was struck by Wordsworth&#x27;s boldness in centring his poetry on the human mind. In response to Wordsworth&#x27;s poetic program that, “when we look / Into our Minds, into the Mind of Man- / My haunt, and the main region of my song” (&quot;The Excursion&quot;), William Blake wrote to his friend Henry Crabb Robinson that the passage &quot; caused him a bowel complaint which nearly killed him”.

Following the death of his friend, the painter William Green in 1823, Wordsworth also mended his relations with Coleridge. The two were fully reconciled by 1828 when they toured the Rhineland together. Dorothy suffered from a severe illness in 1829 that rendered her an invalid for the remainder of her life. Coleridge and Charles Lamb both died in 1834, their loss being a difficult blow to Wordsworth. The following year saw the passing of James Hogg. Despite the death of many contemporaries, the popularity of his poetry ensured a steady stream of young friends and admirers to replace those he lost.

==Religious and philosophical beliefs==
Wordsworth&#x27;s youthful political radicalism, unlike Coleridge&#x27;s, never led him to rebel against his religious upbringing. He remarked in 1812 that he was willing to shed his blood for the established Church of England, reflected in his &quot;Ecclesiastical Sketches&quot; of 1822. This religious conservatism also colours &quot;The Excursion&quot; (1814), a long poem that became extremely popular during the nineteenth century. It features three central characters: the Wanderer, the Solitary, who has experienced the hopes and miseries of the French Revolution, and the Pastor, who dominates the last third of the poem.

=== Wordsworth&#x27;s poetic philosophy ===
Behler has pointed out the fact that Wordsworth wanted to invoke the basic feeling that a human heart possesses and expresses. He had reversed the philosophical standpoint expressed by his friend S. T. Coleridge, of &#x27;creating the characters in such an environment so that the public feels them belonging to the distant place and time&#x27;. And this philosophical realisation by Wordsworth indeed allowed him to choose the language and structural patterning of the poetry that a common person used every day. Kurland wrote that the conversational aspect of a language emerges through social necessity. Social necessity posits the theme of possessing the proper knowledge, interest and biases also among the speakers. William Wordsworth has used conversation in his poetry to let the poet &#x27;I&#x27; merge into &#x27;We&#x27;. The poem &quot;Farewell&quot; exposes the identical emotion that the poet and his sister nourish:

&quot;We leave you here in solitude to dwell/ With these our latest gifts of tender thought; 

Thou, like the morning, in thy saffron coat,/ Bright gowan, and marsh-marigold, farewell!&quot; (L.19–22). 

This kind of conversational tone persists throughout the poet&#x27;s poetic journey, which positions him as a man in society who speaks to the purpose of communion with the very common mass of that society. Again; &quot;&quot;Preface to Lyrical Ballads&quot; &quot; is the evidence where the poet expresses why he is writing and what he is writing and what purpose it will serve humanity.

== Laureateship and other honours ==
Wordsworth remained a formidable presence in his later years. In 1837, the Scottish poet and playwright Joanna Baillie reflected on her long acquaintance with Wordsworth. &quot;He looks like a man that one must not speak to unless one has some sensible thing to say. However, he does occasionally converse cheerfully &amp; well, and when one knows how benevolent &amp; excellent he is, it disposes one to be very much pleased with him.&quot;

In 1838, Wordsworth received an honorary doctorate in Civil Law from the University of Durham. The following year he was awarded the same honorary degree by the University of Oxford, when John Keble praised him as the &quot;poet of humanity&quot;, praise greatly appreciated by Wordsworth. (It has been argued that Wordsworth was a significant influence on Keble&#x27;s immensely popular book of devotional poetry, &quot;The Christian Year&quot; (1827).) In 1842, the government awarded him a Civil List pension of £300 a year.

Following the death of Robert Southey in 1843, Wordsworth became Poet Laureate. He initially refused the honour, saying that he was too old, but accepted when the Prime Minister, Robert Peel, assured him that &quot;you shall have nothing required of you&quot;. Wordsworth thus became the only poet laureate to write no official verses. The sudden death of his daughter Dora in 1847 at age 42 was difficult for the ageing poet to take, and in his depression, he ultimately gave up writing new material.

==Death==

William Wordsworth died at home at Rydal Mount from an aggravated case of pleurisy on 23 April 1850, and was buried at St Oswald&#x27;s Church, Grasmere. His widow, Mary, published his lengthy autobiographical &quot;Poem to Coleridge&quot; as &quot;The Prelude&quot; several months after his death. Though it failed to interest people at the time, it has since come to be widely recognised as his masterpiece.

== In popular culture ==
Margaret Louisa Woods portrayed the young Wordsworth in her novel &quot;A Poet&#x27;s Youth&quot; (1923).

Ken Russell&#x27;s 1978 film &quot;William and Dorothy&quot; portrays the relationship between William and his sister Dorothy.

Wordsworth and Coleridge&#x27;s friendship is examined by Julien Temple in his 2000 film &quot;Pandaemonium&quot;.

Wordsworth has appeared as a character in works of fiction, including:
* William Kinsolving – &quot;Mister Christian&quot;. 1996
* Jasper Fforde – &quot;The Eyre Affair&quot;. 2001
* Val McDermid – &quot;The Grave Tattoo&quot;. 2006
* Sue Limb – &quot;The Wordsmiths at Gorsemere&quot;. 2008

Isaac Asimov&#x27;s 1966 novelisation of the 1966 film &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; sees Dr. Peter Duval quoting Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;The Prelude&quot; as the miniaturised submarine sails through the cerebral fluid surrounding a human brain, comparing it to the &quot;strange seas of thought&quot;.

Taylor Swift&#x27;s 2020 album &quot;Folklore&quot; alludes to Wordsworth in her bonus track &quot;The Lakes&quot;, which is thought to be about the Lake District.

==Commemoration==
In April 2020, the Royal Mail issued a series of postage stamps to mark the 250th anniversary of the birth of Wordsworth. Ten 1st class stamps were issued featuring Wordsworth and all the major British Romantic poets, including William Blake, John Keats, Lord Byron, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Percy Bysshe Shelley and Walter Scott. Each stamp included an extract from one of their most popular and enduring works, with Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;The Rainbow&quot; selected for the poet.

<text>Walnut ink is an ink made from the green husk surrounding the nut of walnuts. The black walnut &quot;Juglans nigra&quot; is usually used. The ink may be liquid or made of crystals that are mixed with water before use. It can be used to produce stains and darken paper to make it look older.
The ink has good archival properties.

An ancient use of walnut ink was to stain the hands of criminals in Romani communities. Once stained, it is impossible to wash off and remains in the skin for a long period of time.

<text>West Side Story is a musical conceived by Jerome Robbins with music by Leonard Bernstein, lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, and a book by Arthur Laurents.

Inspired by William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, the story is set in the mid-1950s in the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City, then a multiracial, blue-collar neighborhood. The musical explores the rivalry between the Jets and the Sharks, two teenage street gangs of different ethnic backgrounds. The Sharks, who are recent migrants from Puerto Rico, and the Jets, who are white, vie for dominance of the neighborhood, and the police try to keep order. The young protagonist, Tony, a former member of the Jets and best friend of the gang&#x27;s leader, Riff, falls in love with Maria, the sister of Bernardo, the leader of the Sharks. The dark theme, sophisticated music, extended dance scenes, tragic love story, and focus on social problems marked a turning point in musical theatre.

The original 1957 Broadway production, directed and choreographed by Robbins, marked Sondheim&#x27;s Broadway debut. It ran for 732 performances before going on tour. The production was nominated for six Tony Awards, including Best Musical, in 1958, winning two. The show had an even longer-running West End production, a number of revivals, and international productions. A 1961 musical film adaptation, co-directed by Robert Wise and Robbins, was nominated for eleven Academy Awards and won ten, including Best Picture. A 2021 film adaptation, directed by Steven Spielberg was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, along with six additional nominations, winning for Best Supporting Actress.

==Background==
===Genesis===
In 1949, Jerome Robbins approached Leonard Bernstein and Arthur Laurents about collaborating on a contemporary musical adaptation of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. He proposed that the plot focus on the conflict between an Irish Catholic family and a Jewish family living on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, during the Easter–Passover season. The girl has survived the Holocaust and emigrated from Israel; the conflict was to be centered on antisemitism of the Catholic &quot;Jets&quot; towards the Jewish &quot;Emeralds&quot; (a name that made its way into the script as a reference). Eager to write his first musical, Laurents immediately agreed. Bernstein wanted to present the material in operatic form, but Robbins and Laurents resisted the suggestion. They described the project as &quot;lyric theater&quot;, and Laurents wrote a first draft he called &quot;East Side Story&quot;. Only after he completed it did the group realize it was little more than a musicalization of themes that had already been covered in plays like &quot;Abie&#x27;s Irish Rose&quot;. When Robbins opted to drop out, the three men went their separate ways, and the piece was shelved for almost five years.

In 1955, theatrical producer Martin Gabel was working on a stage adaptation of the James M. Cain novel &quot;Serenade&quot;, about an opera singer who comes to the realization he is homosexual, and he invited Laurents to write the book. Laurents accepted and suggested Bernstein and Robbins join the creative team. Robbins felt if the three were going to join forces, they should return to &quot;East Side Story&quot;, and Bernstein agreed. Laurents, however, was committed to Gabel, who introduced him to the young composer/lyricist Stephen Sondheim. Sondheim auditioned by playing the score for &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, his musical that was scheduled to open in the fall. Laurents liked the lyrics but was not impressed with the music. Sondheim did not care for Laurents&#x27; opinion. &quot;Serenade&quot; ultimately was shelved.

Laurents was soon hired to write the screenplay for a remake of the 1934 Greta Garbo film &quot;The Painted Veil&quot; for Ava Gardner. While in Hollywood, he contacted Bernstein, who was in town conducting at the Hollywood Bowl. The two met at The Beverly Hills Hotel, and the conversation turned to juvenile delinquent gangs, a fairly recent social phenomenon that had received major coverage on the front pages of the morning newspapers due to a Chicano turf war. Bernstein suggested they rework &quot;East Side Story&quot; and set it in Los Angeles, but Laurents felt he was more familiar with Puerto Ricans in the United States and Harlem than he was with Mexican Americans and Olvera Street. The two contacted Robbins, who was enthusiastic about a musical with a Latin beat. He arrived in Hollywood to choreograph the dance sequences for the 1956 film &quot;The King and I&quot;, and he and Laurents began developing the musical while working on their respective projects, keeping in touch with Bernstein, who had returned to New York. When the producer of &quot;The Painted Veil&quot; replaced Gardner with Eleanor Parker and asked Laurents to revise his script with her in mind, he backed out of the film, freeing him to devote all his time to the stage musical. Bernstein and Laurents, who had been blacklisted for alleged communist activities, worked with Robbins even though he had cooperated with the House Un-American Activities Committee.

===Collaboration and development===
In New York City, Laurents went to the opening night party for a new play by Ugo Betti. There he met Sondheim, who had heard that &quot;East Side Story&quot;, now retitled &quot;West Side Story&quot;, was back on track. Bernstein had decided he needed to concentrate solely on the music, and he and Robbins had invited Betty Comden and Adolph Green to write the lyrics, but the team opted to work on &quot;Peter Pan&quot; instead. Laurents asked Sondheim if he would be interested in tackling the task. Initially he resisted, because he was determined to write the full score for his next project (&quot;Saturday Night&quot; had been scrapped). But Oscar Hammerstein convinced him that he would benefit from the experience, and he accepted. Meanwhile, Laurents had written a new draft of the book changing the characters&#x27; backgrounds: the male lead, once an Irish American, was now of Polish and Irish descent, and the formerly Jewish female lead had become Puerto Rican.

The original book Laurents wrote closely adhered to &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, but the characters based on Shakespeare&#x27;s Rosaline and the parents of the doomed lovers were eliminated early on. Later the scenes related to Juliet&#x27;s faking her death and committing suicide also were deleted. Language posed a problem; profanity was uncommon in the theater at the time, and slang expressions were avoided for fear they would be dated by the time the production opened. Laurents ultimately invented what sounded like real street talk but actually was not: &quot;cut the frabba-jabba&quot;, for example. Sondheim converted long passages of dialogue, and sometimes just a simple phrase like &quot;A boy like that would kill your brother&quot;, into lyrics. With the help of Oscar Hammerstein, Laurents convinced Bernstein and Sondheim to move &quot;One Hand, One Heart&quot;, which he considered too pristine for the balcony scene, to the scene set in the bridal shop, and as a result &quot;Tonight&quot; was written to replace it. Laurents felt that the building tension needed to be alleviated in order to increase the impact of the play&#x27;s tragic outcome, so comic relief in the form of Officer Krupke was added to the second act. He was outvoted on other issues: he felt the lyrics to &quot;America&quot; and &quot;I Feel Pretty&quot; were too witty for the characters singing them, but they stayed in the score and proved to be audience favorites. Another song, &quot;Kid Stuff&quot;, was added and quickly removed during the Washington, D.C., tryout when Laurents convinced the others it was helping tip the balance of the show into typical musical comedy.

Bernstein composed &quot;West Side Story&quot; and &quot;Candide&quot; concurrently, which led to some switches of material between the two works. Tony and Maria&#x27;s duet, &quot;One Hand, One Heart&quot;, was originally intended for Cunegonde in &quot;Candide&quot;. The music of &quot;Gee, Officer Krupke&quot; was pulled from the Venice scene in &quot;Candide&quot;. Laurents explained the style that the creative team finally decided on:
The show was nearly complete in the fall of 1956, but almost everyone on the creative team needed to fulfill other commitments first. Robbins was involved with &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot;, then Bernstein with &quot;Candide&quot;, and in January 1957 &quot;A Clearing in the Woods&quot;, Laurents&#x27; latest play, opened and quickly closed. When a backers&#x27; audition failed to raise any money for &quot;West Side Story&quot; late in the spring of 1957, only two months before the show was to begin rehearsals, producer Cheryl Crawford pulled out of the project. Every other producer had already turned down the show, deeming it too dark and depressing. Bernstein was despondent, but Sondheim convinced his friend Hal Prince, who was in Boston overseeing the out-of-town tryout of the new George Abbott musical &quot;New Girl in Town&quot;, to read the script. He liked it but decided to ask Abbott, his longtime mentor, for his opinion, and Abbott advised him to turn it down. Prince, aware that Abbott was the primary reason &quot;New Girl&quot; was in trouble, decided to ignore him, and he and his producing partner Robert E. Griffith flew to New York to hear the score. In his memoirs, Prince recalled: &quot;Sondheim and Bernstein sat at the piano playing through the music, and soon I was singing along with them&quot;.

===Production period===
Prince began cutting the budget and raising money. Robbins then announced he did not want to choreograph the show, but changed his mind when Prince agreed to an eight-week dance rehearsal period (instead of the customary four), since there was to be more dancing in &quot;West Side Story&quot; than in any previous Broadway show, and allowed Robbins to hire Peter Gennaro as his assistant. Originally, when considering the cast, Laurents wanted James Dean for the lead role of Tony, but the actor soon died. Sondheim found Larry Kert and Chita Rivera, who created the roles of Tony and Anita, respectively. Getting the work on stage was still not easy. Bernstein said:
Throughout the rehearsal period, the New York newspapers were filled with articles about gang warfare, keeping the show&#x27;s plot timely. Robbins kept the cast members playing the Sharks and the Jets separate to discourage them from socializing with each other and reminded everyone of the reality of gang violence by posting news stories on the bulletin board backstage. Robbins wanted a gritty realism from his sneaker- and jeans-clad cast. He gave the ensemble more freedom than Broadway dancers had previously been given to interpret their roles, and the dancers were thrilled to be treated like actors instead of just choreographed bodies. Robbins gave each dancer a unique gesture repertoire specific to their character. As the rehearsals wore on, Bernstein fought to keep his score together, as other members of the team called on him to cut out more and more of the sweeping or complex &quot;operatic&quot; passages. Columbia Records initially declined to record the cast album, saying the score was too depressing and too difficult.

There were problems with Oliver Smith&#x27;s designs. His painted backdrops were stunning, but the sets were, for the most part, either shabby looking or too stylized. Prince refused to spend money on new construction, and Smith was obliged to improve what he had as best he could with very little money to do it. The pre-Broadway run in Washington, D.C., was a critical and commercial success, although none of the reviews mentioned Sondheim, listed as co-lyricist, who was overshadowed by the better-known Bernstein. Bernstein magnanimously removed his name as co-author of the lyrics, although Sondheim was uncertain he wanted to receive sole credit for what he considered to be overly florid contributions by Bernstein. Robbins demanded and received a &quot;Conceived by&quot; credit, and used it to justify his making major decisions regarding changes in the show without consulting the others. As a result, by opening night on Broadway, none of his collaborators were talking to him.

It has been rumored that while Bernstein was off trying to fix the musical &quot;Candide&quot;, Sondheim wrote some of the music for &quot;West Side Story&quot;, and that Bernstein&#x27;s co-lyricist billing mysteriously disappeared from the credits of &quot;West Side Story&quot; during the tryout, presumably as a trade-off. However, Steven Suskin writes in &quot;Show Tunes&quot; that &quot;as the writing progressed and the extent of Bernstein&#x27;s lyric contributions became less, the composer agreed to rescind his credit. ... Contrary to rumor, Sondheim did not write music for the show; his only contribution came on &#x27;Something&#x27;s Coming&#x27;&quot;, where he developed the main strain of the chorus from music Bernstein wrote for the verse.

==Synopsis==
===Act 1===
Two rival teenage gangs, the Jets (white Americans) and the Sharks (Puerto Ricans), struggle for control of their neighborhood on the Upper West Side of Manhattan (Prologue). Police officers Krupke and Lt. Schrank warn them to stop fighting on their beat. The police chase the Sharks off, and then the Jets plan how they can assure their continued dominance of the street. The Jets&#x27; leader, Riff, suggests setting up a rumble with the Sharks. He plans to make the challenge to Bernardo, the Sharks&#x27; leader, that night at the neighborhood dance. Riff wants to convince his best friend and former member of the Jets, Tony, to meet the Jets at the dance. Some of the Jets are unsure of his loyalty, but Riff is adamant that Tony is still one of them (&quot;Jet Song&quot;). Riff meets Tony while he&#x27;s working at Doc&#x27;s Drugstore to persuade him to come. Tony initially refuses, but Riff wins him over. Tony is convinced that something important is round the corner (&quot;Something&#x27;s Coming&quot;).

Maria works in a bridal shop with Anita, the girlfriend of her brother, Bernardo. Maria has just arrived from Puerto Rico for her arranged marriage to Chino, a friend of Bernardo&#x27;s. Maria confesses to Anita that she is not in love with Chino. Anita makes Maria a dress to wear to the neighborhood dance.
At the dance, after introductions, the teenagers begin to dance; soon a challenge dance is called (&quot;Dance at the Gym&quot;), during which Tony and Maria (who aren&#x27;t taking part in the challenge dance) see each other across the room and are drawn to each other. They dance together, forgetting the tension in the room, and fall in love, but Bernardo pulls his sister from Tony and sends her home. Riff and Bernardo agree to meet for a War Council at Doc&#x27;s, a drug store which is considered neutral ground, but meanwhile, an infatuated and happy Tony finds Maria&#x27;s building and serenades her outside her bedroom (&quot;Maria&quot;). She appears on her fire escape, and the two profess their love for one another (&quot;Tonight&quot;). Meanwhile, Anita, Rosalia, and the other Shark girls discuss the differences between the territory of Puerto Rico and the mainland United States of America, with Anita defending America, and Rosalia yearning for Puerto Rico (&quot;America&quot;).

The Jets get antsy while waiting for the Sharks inside Doc&#x27;s drugstore. Riff helps them let out their aggression (&quot;Cool&quot;). The Sharks arrive to discuss weapons to use in the rumble. Tony suggests &quot;a fair fight&quot; (fists only), which the leaders agree to, despite the other members&#x27; protests. Bernardo believes that he will fight Tony, but must settle for fighting Diesel, Riff&#x27;s second-in-command, instead. This is followed by a monologue by the ineffective Lt. Schrank trying to find out the location of the rumble. Tony tells Doc about Maria. Doc is worried for them while Tony is convinced that nothing can go wrong; he is in love.
The next day, Maria is in a very happy mood at the bridal shop, as she anticipates seeing Tony again, but she is dismayed when she learns about the upcoming rumble from Anita. When Tony arrives, Maria insists that he must stop the fight altogether, which he agrees to do. Before he goes, they dream of their wedding (&quot;One Hand, One Heart&quot;). Tony, Maria, Anita, Bernardo and the Sharks, and Riff and the Jets all anticipate the events to come that night (&quot;Tonight Quintet&quot;). The gangs meet under the highway and, as the fight between Bernardo and Diesel begins, Tony arrives and tries to stop it. Though Bernardo taunts and provokes Tony, ridiculing his attempt to make peace, Tony keeps his composure. When Bernardo pushes Tony, Riff punches him in Tony&#x27;s defense. The two draw their switchblades and get in a fight (&quot;The Rumble&quot;). Tony attempts to intervene, inadvertently leading to Riff being fatally stabbed by Bernardo. Tony kills Bernardo in a fit of rage, which in turn provokes an all-out fight like the fight in the Prologue. The sound of approaching police sirens is heard, and everyone scatters, except Tony, who stands in shock at what he has done. The tomboy Anybodys, who stubbornly wishes that she could become a Jet, tells Tony to flee from the scene at the last moment and leaves with the knives. Only the bodies of Riff and Bernardo remain.

===Act 2===

Blissfully unaware that the rumble has taken place with fatal consequences, Maria giddily sings to her friends Rosalia, Teresita, and Francisca that she is in love (&quot;I Feel Pretty&quot;). Chino brings the news that Tony has killed Bernardo, then leaves. Maria prays that what he has told her is a lie. Tony arrives to see Maria and she initially pounds on his chest with rage, but she still loves him. They plan to run away together. As the walls of Maria&#x27;s bedroom disappear, they find themselves in a dreamlike world of peace (&quot;Somewhere&quot;).

Two of the Jets, A-Rab and Baby John, are set on by Officer Krupke, but they manage to escape him. They meet the rest of the gang. To cheer themselves up, they lampoon Krupke and the other adults who don&#x27;t understand them (&quot;Gee, Officer Krupke&quot;). Anybodys arrives and tells the Jets that she has been spying on the Puerto Ricans; she has discovered that Chino has a gun and is looking for Tony. The gang separates to find Tony and protect him. Action has taken charge; he accepts Anybodys into the Jets and includes her in the search.

A grieving Anita arrives at Maria&#x27;s apartment. As Tony leaves, he tells Maria to meet him at Doc&#x27;s so they can run away to the country. In spite of her attempts to conceal it, Anita sees that Tony has been with Maria, and launches an angry tirade against him (&quot;A Boy Like That&quot;). Maria counters by telling Anita how powerful love is (&quot;I Have a Love&quot;), and Anita realizes that Maria loves Tony as much as she had loved Bernardo. She admits that Chino has a gun and is looking for Tony. Lt. Schrank arrives to question Maria about her brother&#x27;s death, and Anita agrees to go to Doc&#x27;s to warn Tony that Maria will be late. Unfortunately, the Jets, who have found Tony, have congregated at Doc&#x27;s, and they taunt Anita with racist slurs and eventually attempt rape. Doc arrives and stops them. Furious, Anita spitefully delivers the wrong message, telling the Jets that Chino has shot Maria dead.

Doc relates the news to Tony, who has been dreaming of heading to the countryside to have children with Maria. Feeling there is no longer anything to live for, Tony leaves to find Chino, begging for him to shoot him as well. Just as Tony sees Maria alive, Chino arrives and shoots Tony. The Jets, Sharks, and adults flock around the lovers. Maria holds Tony in her arms (and sings a quiet, brief reprise of &quot;Somewhere&quot;) as he dies. Angry at the death of another friend, the Jets move towards the Sharks but Maria takes Chino&#x27;s gun and tells everyone that &quot;all of [them]&quot; killed Tony and the others because of their hate for each other, and, &quot;Now I can kill too, because now I have hate!&quot; she yells. However, she is unable to bring herself to fire the gun and drops it, crying in grief. Gradually, all the members of both gangs assemble on either side of Tony&#x27;s body, showing that the feud is over. The Jets and Sharks form a procession, and together carry Tony away, with Maria the last one in the procession.

==Productions==
===Original Broadway production===

After tryouts in Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia beginning in August 1957, the original Broadway production opened at the Winter Garden Theatre on September 26, to positive reviews. The production was directed and choreographed by Jerome Robbins, orchestrated by Sid Ramin and Irwin Kostal, and produced by Robert E. Griffith and Harold Prince, with lighting designed by Jean Rosenthal. The cast starred Larry Kert as Tony, Carol Lawrence as Maria, Chita Rivera as Anita and David Winters as Baby John. The other notable cast members in the original production were: Riff: Michael Callan, A-Rab: Tony Mordente, Big Deal: Martin Charnin, Gee-Tar: Tommy Abbott, Chino: Jamie Sanchez, Rosalia: Marilyn Cooper, Consuela: Reri Grist, Doc: Art Smith and Francisca: Elizabeth Taylor. The production closed on June 27, 1959, after 732 performances. Robbins won the Tony Award for Best Choreographer, and Oliver Smith won the Tony for Best Scenic Designer. Also nominated were Carol Lawrence as Best Actress in a Supporting Role in a Musical, Max Goberman as Best Musical Director and Conductor, and Irene Sharaff for Best Costume Design. Carol Lawrence received the 1958 Theatre World Award.

The production&#x27;s national tour was launched on July 1, 1959, in Denver and then played in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Detroit, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Boston. It returned to the Winter Garden Theater in New York in April 1960 for another 249 performance engagement, closing in December.

===UK productions===
A 1958 production at the Manchester Opera House transferred to London, where it opened at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in the West End on December 12, and ran until June 1961 with a total of 1,039 performances. Robbins directed and choreographed, and it was co-choreographed by Peter Gennaro, with scenery by Oliver Smith. Featured performers were George Chakiris, who won an Academy Award as Bernardo in the 1961 film version, as Riff, Marlys Watters as Maria, Don McKay as Tony, and Chita Rivera reprising her Broadway role as Anita. David Holliday, who had been playing Gladhand since the London opening, took over as Tony.

The refurbished Shaftesbury Theatre reopened with a run of &quot;West Side Story&quot; from December 19, 1974, to mid-1975. It was directed by Bill Kenwright, choreographed by Roger Finch, and starred Lionel Morton as Tony and Christiana Matthews as Maria. A London production originated at Leicester Haymarket Theatre in early 1984 and transferred on May 16, to Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre. It closed on September 28, 1985. The 1980 Broadway production was recreated by Tom Abbott. The cast starred Steven Pacey as Tony and Jan Hartley as Maria. Maxine Gordon was Anybodys.

A UK national tour started in 1997 and starred David Habbin as Tony, Katie Knight Adams as Maria and Anna-Jane Casey as Anita. The production transferred to London&#x27;s West End opening at the Prince Edward Theatre in October 1998, transferring to the Prince of Wales Theatre where it closed in January 2000. The production subsequently toured the UK for a second time.

A production at the Curve Theatre, starring Jamie Muscato as Tony and Adriana Ivelisse as Maria, ran from November 23, 2019, to January 11, 2020.

===1980 Broadway revival===
A Broadway revival opened at the Minskoff Theatre on February 14, 1980, and closed on November 30, after 333 performances. It was directed and choreographed by Robbins, with the book scenes co-directed by Gerald Freedman; produced by Gladys Nederlander and Tom Abbott; Lee Theodore assisted in the choreography reproduction. The original scenic, lighting, and costume designs were used. It starred Ken Marshall as Tony, Josie de Guzman as Maria and Debbie Allen as Anita. Both de Guzman and Allen received Tony Award nominations as Best Featured Actress in a Musical, and the musical was nominated as Best Reproduction (Play or Musical). Allen won the Drama Desk Award as Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical. Other notable cast members included Brent Barrett as Diesel, Harolyn Blackwell as Francisca, Stephen Bogardus as Mouth Piece and Reed Jones as Big Deal.

The Minskoff production subsequently opened the Nervi Festival in Genoa, Italy, in July 1981 with Josie de Guzman as Maria and Brent Barrett as Tony.

===2009 Broadway revival===
In 2007, Arthur Laurents stated: &quot;I&#x27;ve come up with a way of doing [&quot;West Side Story&quot;] that will make it absolutely contemporary without changing a word or a note&quot;. He directed a pre-Broadway production of &quot;West Side Story&quot; at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C., that ran from December 15, 2008, through January 17, 2009. The Broadway revival began previews at the Palace Theatre on February 23, 2009, and opened on March 19. The production wove Spanish lyrics and dialogue into the English libretto. The translations are by Tony Award winner Lin-Manuel Miranda. Laurents said: &quot;The musical theatre and cultural conventions of 1957 made it next to impossible for the characters to have authenticity. Every member of both gangs was always a potential killer even then. Now they actually will be. Only Tony and Maria try to live in a different world&quot;. In August 2009, some of the lyrics for &quot;A Boy Like That&quot; (&quot;Un Hombre Asi&quot;) and &quot;I Feel Pretty&quot; (&quot;Me Siento Hermosa&quot;), which were previously sung in Spanish in the revival, were changed back to the original English. The Spanish lyrics sung by the Sharks in the &quot;Tonight&quot; (Quintet) remained in Spanish.
The cast featured Matt Cavenaugh as Tony, Josefina Scaglione as Maria, and Karen Olivo as Anita. Olivo won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress, while Scaglione was nominated for the award for Leading Actress. Jeremy Jordan later was an alternate as Tony. The cast recording won the Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album. In July 2010, the producers reduced the size of the orchestra, replacing five musicians with an off-stage synthesizer. The production closed on January 2, 2011, after 748 performances and 27 previews. The revival sold 1,074,462 tickets on Broadway over the course of nearly two years and was a financial success.

===2020 Broadway revival===

A Broadway revival of &quot;West Side Story&quot; began previews on December 10, 2019, and officially opened on February 20, 2020, at the Broadway Theatre. It was directed by Ivo van Hove, with choreography by Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker and was produced by Scott Rudin, Barry Diller and David Geffen. The cast included Shereen Pimentel as Maria, Isaac Cole Powell as Tony, Amar Ramasar as Bernardo, Thomas Jay Ryan as Lt. Schrank and Yesenia Ayala as Anita. Scenic and lighting design were by Jan Versweyveld, with costumes by An d&#x27;Huys.

The production cut the song &quot;I Feel Pretty&quot; and trimmed the book to one hour and forty-five minutes (with no intermission). The setting was &quot;loosely updated to the present&quot;, and direction was &quot;determined to snuff out any lightness that might temper the full-blown tragedy to come&quot;. The original balletic, finger snapping choreography was replaced by swaggering, hip-hop and latin-influenced dancing. The set consisted mostly of large screens featuring video, several cast members carried iPhones, and the Jets were not all white. Some theatergoers felt that the set turned the theatre into a cinema, but critic Charles McNulty argued that it wove technology into a multimedia &quot;performance work that defies our usual vocabulary&quot;. The production also drew criticism for its casting of Ramasar, who had been accused of sexually inappropriate behavior and was fired from the New York City Ballet and suspended from &quot;Carousel&quot;, as well as the graphic staging of the Jets&#x27; assault and attempted rape of Anita which, together, &quot;sends a message that women’s bodies are collateral damage in male artistic success&quot;. Van Hove&#x27;s casting of African American Jets, &quot;dangerously, shifts our focus away from the enduring problem of white supremacist violence&quot;. While praising the cast, except for Ramasar, Alexandra Schwartz, writing in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, felt that the use of the videos &quot;dwarfs the actors with their own gigantic images... the technique is banal&quot;, while the mixed casting of the Jets creates &quot;a bitter, unintended irony in the context of African-American history&quot;.

March 11, 2020, was the show&#x27;s last performance before production was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of its opening date, it was not eligible for 2020 Tony Award consideration. The production did not reopen, and so its total run was 78 previews and 24 performances.

===Other notable US productions and tours===
The New York City Center Light Opera Company production played for a limited engagement of 31 performances from April 8 to May 3, 1964. The cast featured Don McKay (Tony), Julia Migenes (Maria) and Luba Lisa (Anita). It was staged by Gerald Freedman with choreography re-mounted by Tom Abbott. The Musical Theater of Lincoln Center and Richard Rodgers production opened at the New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, in June 1968 and closed in September after 89 performances. Direction and choreography were reproduced by Lee Theodore, and scenery was by Oliver Smith. Tony was played by Kurt Peterson, with Victoria Mallory as Maria. A 1987 US tour starred Jack Wagner as Tony, with Valarie Pettiford as Anita and was directed by Alan Johnson.

A national tour, directed by Alan Johnson, was produced in 2002. A national tour of the 2009 Broadway revival began in October 2010 at the Fisher Theatre in Detroit, Michigan, and toured for two seasons. The cast featured Kyle Harris as Tony and Ali Ewoldt as Maria. Chicago Lyric Opera staged the musical in 2019 and again in 2023, directed by Francesca Zambello and choreographed by Joshua Bergasse; Ryan McCartan starred as Tony.

The musical has also been adapted to be performed as &quot;Deaf Side Story&quot; using both English and American Sign Language, with deaf Sharks and hearing Jets.

===International productions===
The first Australian production opened in October 1960 at the Princess Theatre in Melbourne, before touring to the Tivoli Theatre in Sydney in February 1961. Subsequent Australian tours have been staged in 1983, 1994, 2010 and twice in 2019. It returned to Handa Opera on Sydney Harbour in 2024.

==Critical reaction==
The creators&#x27; innovations in dance, music and theatrical style drew enthusiastic reactions from the critics. Walter Kerr wrote in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; on September 27, 1957:

The other reviews generally joined in speculation about how the new work would influence the course of musical theater. Typical was John Chapman&#x27;s review in the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; on September 27, 1957, headed: &quot;&quot;West Side Story&quot; a Splendid and Super-Modern Musical Drama&quot;.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine found the dance and gang warfare more compelling than the love story and noted that the show&#x27;s &quot;putting choreography foremost, may prove a milestone in musical-drama history&quot;. One writer noted: &quot;The story appealed to society&#x27;s undercurrent of rebellion from authority that surfaced in 1950s films like &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;. ... Robbins&#x27; energetic choreography and Bernstein&#x27;s grand score accentuated the satiric, hard-edged lyrics of Sondheim, and Laurents&#x27; capture of the angry voice of urban youth. The play was criticized for glamorizing gangs, and its portrayal of Puerto Ricans and lack of authentic Latin casting were weaknesses. Yet, the same writer commented, the song &quot;America&quot; shows the triumph of the spirit over the obstacles often faced by immigrants. The musical also made points in its description of troubled youth and the devastating effects of poverty and racism. Juvenile delinquency is seen as an ailment of society: &quot;No one wants a fella with a social disease!&quot; The writer concluded: &quot;On the cusp of the 1960s, American society, still recovering from the enormous upheaval of World War II, was seeking stability and control&quot;.

==Score==
Bernstein&#x27;s score for &quot;West Side Story&quot; blends &quot;jazz, Latin rhythms, symphonic sweep and musical-comedy conventions in groundbreaking ways for Broadway&quot;. It was orchestrated by Sid Ramin and Irwin Kostal following detailed instructions from Bernstein, who then wrote revisions on their manuscript (the original, heavily annotated by Ramin, Kostal and Bernstein, is in the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at Columbia University). Ramin, Kostal and Bernstein are billed as orchestrators for the show. The original orchestra consisted of 31 players: a large Broadway pit orchestra enhanced to include 5 percussionists, a guitarist and a piano/celesta player.

In 1960, Bernstein prepared a suite of orchestral music from the show, the &quot;Symphonic Dances from West Side Story&quot;. It consists of nine movements: Prologue (&quot;Allegro moderato&quot;), &quot;Somewhere&quot; (&quot;Adagio&quot;), Scherzo (&quot;Vivace e leggero&quot;), Mambo (&quot;Meno presto&quot;), Cha-Cha (&quot;Andantino con grazia&quot;), Meeting Scene (&quot;Meno mosso&quot;), &quot;Cool&quot; Fugue (&quot;Allegretto&quot;), Rumble (&quot;Molto allegro&quot;), and Finale (&quot;Adagio&quot;). It premiered on February 13, 1961, at Carnegie Hall with the New York Philharmonic conducted by Lukas Foss. The suite was later included as bonus tracks on the original Broadway cast recording.

==Analysis of the book==

As in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, the love between members of two rival groups in &quot;West Side Story&quot; leads to violent confrontations &quot;and a tragic ending with an underlying message: Violence breeds violence, so make peace and learn to share turf&quot;. Among the social themes explored in the musical are &quot;bigotry, cultural misunderstanding and the social failure to fully integrate and empower young people in constructive ways&quot;.

Misha Berson names four key differences from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in the musical: the feud derives from cultural difference; the plot omits the parents and former romances; the assault on Anita leads her to withhold the news of Maria&#x27;s death from Tony; and Maria survives at the end. Carla Della Gatta adds an additional three: the Jets are the holders of public space (whereas the Capulets begin Shakespeare&#x27;s play); Tony does not kill Chino (whereas Romeo kills Paris); and Chino kills Tony (whereas Paris does not kill Romeo).

==Films==
===1961===
The 1961 film adaptation of the musical received praise from critics and the public and became the second-highest-grossing film of the year in the United States. The film won ten Academy Awards in its eleven nominated categories, including Best Picture. It received the most Academy Awards (10 wins) of any musical film, including Best Picture. Rita Moreno, as Anita, was the first Latina actress ever to win an Oscar. The soundtrack album won a Grammy Award and was ranked No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart for a record 54 weeks. Differences in the film from the stage version include moving &quot;Tonight&quot; to follow &quot;America&quot; and &quot;I Feel Pretty&quot; to precede the rumble. Diesel is renamed Ice. &quot;Gee, Officer Krupke&quot; is moved before &quot;Cool&quot; and is sung by Riff instead of Action, and &quot;Cool&quot; is sung by Ice instead of Riff. After Riff is killed, Ice takes control of the Jets, rather than Action.

===1979===
A 1979 Egyptian adaptation ( transliterated as &quot;Quessat al-Ay al-Gharby&quot;) was directed by Adel Sadeq based on the musical and the 1961 film. The cast features Hussein Fahmy as Sami, Soheir Ramzi as Amal, Samir Ghanem as Talib, Hassan Youssef as Recep, Saeed Saleh and Soheir Zaki.

===2021===

A 2021 film adaptation, written by Tony Kushner, directed by Steven Spielberg and choreographed by Justin Peck, is based more closely on the Broadway musical than the 1961 film. The cast includes Ansel Elgort as Tony, newcomer Rachel Zegler as Maria, Ariana DeBose as Anita and Mike Faist as Riff. Moreno, who played Anita in the 1961 film, plays Valentina, a reconceived and expanded version of the character Doc, who serves as a mentor to the teenage characters, and sings &quot;Somewhere&quot; in this version. A new Black character, Abe, makes the cast &quot;more representative of ... 1950s New York&quot;. Peck&#x27;s choreography does not attempt to replicate Robbins&#x27; choreography. &quot;Gee, Officer Krupke&quot; and &quot;Cool&quot; are performed in the first half; &quot;One Hand, One Heart&quot; appears in between the two. The film received seven nominations at the 94th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning one Oscar for DeBose&#x27;s performance.

==References in popular culture==
The television show &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; extensively referenced &quot;West Side Story&quot; in the 2009 season seven episode &quot;Officer Krupke&quot;. In the third season of the series &quot;Glee&quot;, three episodes feature characters auditioning, rehearsing and performing a school production of &quot;West Side Story&quot;. The 2005 short musical comedy film &quot;West Bank Story&quot;, which won the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film, concerns a love story between a Jew and a Palestinian and parodies several aspects of &quot;West Side Story&quot;.

In 1963, the magazine &quot;Mad&quot; published &quot;East Side Story&quot; which was set at the United Nations building on the East Side of Manhattan, a parody of the Cold War, with the two rival gangs led by John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev, by writer Frank Jacobs and illustrator Mort Drucker. In the &quot;Discworld&quot; series of books by Terry Pratchett, two feuding noble families are named Selachii and Venturi, the scientific names for &quot;sharks&quot; and &quot;jets&quot;.

From 1973 to 2004, &quot;Wild Side Story&quot;, a camp parody musical, based loosely on &quot;West Side Story&quot; and adapting parts of the musical&#x27;s music and lyrics, was performed a total of more than 500 times in Miami Beach, Florida, Stockholm, Gran Canaria and Los Angeles. The show lampoons the musical&#x27;s tragic love story, and also lip-synching and drag shows.

<text>In science and engineering, the weight of an object is a quantity associated with the gravitational force exerted on the object by other objects in its environment, although there is some variation and debate as to the exact definition.

Some standard textbooks define weight as a vector quantity, the gravitational force acting on the object. Others define weight as a scalar quantity, the magnitude of the gravitational force. Yet others define it as the magnitude of the reaction force exerted on a body by mechanisms that counteract the effects of gravity: the weight is the quantity that is measured by, for example, a spring scale. Thus, in a state of free fall, the weight would be zero. In this sense of weight, terrestrial objects can be weightless: so if one ignores air resistance, one could say the legendary apple falling from the tree, on its way to meet the ground near Isaac Newton, was weightless.

The unit of measurement for weight is that of force, which in the International System of Units (SI) is the newton. For example, an object with a mass of one kilogram has a weight of about 9.8 newtons on the surface of the Earth, and about one-sixth as much on the Moon. Although weight and mass are scientifically distinct quantities, the terms are often confused with each other in everyday use (e.g. comparing and converting force weight in pounds to mass in kilograms and vice versa).

Further complications in elucidating the various concepts of weight have to do with the theory of relativity according to which gravity is modeled as a consequence of the curvature of spacetime. In the teaching community, a considerable debate has existed for over half a century on how to define weight for their students. The current situation is that a multiple set of concepts co-exist and find use in their various contexts.

==History==
Discussion of the concepts of heaviness (weight) and lightness (levity) date back to the ancient Greek philosophers. These were typically viewed as inherent properties of objects. Plato described weight as the natural tendency of objects to seek their kin. To Aristotle, weight and levity represented the tendency to restore the natural order of the basic elements: air, earth, fire and water. He ascribed absolute weight to earth and absolute levity to fire. Archimedes saw weight as a quality opposed to buoyancy, with the conflict between the two determining if an object sinks or floats. The first operational definition of weight was given by Euclid, who defined weight as: &quot;the heaviness or lightness of one thing, compared to another, as measured by a balance.&quot; Operational balances (rather than definitions) had, however, been around much longer.

According to Aristotle, weight was the direct cause of the falling motion of an object, the speed of the falling object was supposed to be directly proportionate to the weight of the object. As medieval scholars discovered that in practice the speed of a falling object increased with time, this prompted a change to the concept of weight to maintain this cause-effect relationship. Weight was split into a &quot;still weight&quot; or , which remained constant, and the actual gravity or , which changed as the object fell. The concept of was eventually replaced by Jean Buridan&#x27;s impetus, a precursor to momentum.

The rise of the Copernican view of the world led to the resurgence of the Platonic idea that like objects attract but in the context of heavenly bodies. In the 17th century, Galileo made significant advances in the concept of weight. He proposed a way to measure the difference between the weight of a moving object and an object at rest. Ultimately, he concluded weight was proportionate to the amount of matter of an object, not the speed of motion as supposed by the Aristotelean view of physics.

===Newton===
The introduction of Newton&#x27;s laws of motion and the development of Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation led to considerable further development of the concept of weight. Weight became fundamentally separate from mass. Mass was identified as a fundamental property of objects connected to their inertia, while weight became identified with the force of gravity on an object and therefore dependent on the context of the object. In particular, Newton considered weight to be relative to another object causing the gravitational pull, e.g. the weight of the Earth towards the Sun.

Newton considered time and space to be absolute. This allowed him to consider concepts as true position and true velocity. Newton also recognized that weight as measured by the action of weighing was affected by environmental factors such as buoyancy. He considered this a false weight induced by imperfect measurement conditions, for which he introduced the term &quot;apparent weight&quot; as compared to the &quot;true weight&quot; defined by gravity.

Although Newtonian physics made a clear distinction between weight and mass, the term weight continued to be commonly used when people meant mass. This led the 3rd General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) of 1901 to officially declare &quot;The word &quot;weight&quot; denotes a quantity of the same nature as a &quot;force&quot;: the weight of a body is the product of its mass and the acceleration due to gravity&quot;, thus distinguishing it from mass for official usage.

===Relativity===
In the 20th century, the Newtonian concepts of absolute time and space were challenged by relativity. Einstein&#x27;s equivalence principle put all observers, moving or accelerating, on the same footing. This led to an ambiguity as to what exactly is meant by the force of gravity and weight. A scale in an accelerating elevator cannot be distinguished from a scale in a gravitational field. Gravitational force and weight thereby became essentially frame-dependent quantities. This prompted the abandonment of the concept as superfluous in the fundamental sciences such as physics and chemistry. Nonetheless, the concept remained important in the teaching of physics. The ambiguities introduced by relativity led, starting in the 1960s, to considerable debate in the teaching community as how to define weight for their students, choosing between a nominal definition of weight as the force due to gravity or an operational definition defined by the act of weighing.

==Definitions==

Several definitions exist for &quot;weight&quot;, not all of which are equivalent.

===Gravitational definition===
The most common definition of weight found in introductory physics textbooks defines weight as the force exerted on a body by gravity. This is often expressed in the formula , where &quot;W&quot; is the weight, &quot;m&quot; the mass of the object, and &quot;g&quot; gravitational acceleration.

In 1901, the 3rd General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) established this as their official definition of &quot;weight&quot;:

This resolution defines weight as a vector, since force is a vector quantity. However, some textbooks also take weight to be a scalar by defining:
The gravitational acceleration varies from place to place. Sometimes, it is simply taken to have a standard value of , which gives the standard weight.

The force whose magnitude is equal to &quot;mg&quot; newtons is also known as the m kilogram weight (which term is abbreviated to kg-wt)

===Operational definition===

In the operational definition, the weight of an object is the force measured by the operation of weighing it, which is the force it exerts on its support. Since &quot;W&quot; is the downward force on the body by the centre of earth and there is no acceleration in the body, there exists an opposite and equal force by the support on the body. Also it is equal to the force exerted by the body on its support because action and reaction have same numerical value and opposite direction. This can make a considerable difference, depending on the details; for example, an object in free fall exerts little if any force on its support, a situation that is commonly referred to as weightlessness. However, being in free fall does not affect the weight according to the gravitational definition. Therefore, the operational definition is sometimes refined by requiring that the object be at rest. However, this raises the issue of defining &quot;at rest&quot; (usually being at rest with respect to the Earth is implied by using standard gravity). In the operational definition, the weight of an object at rest on the surface of the Earth is lessened by the effect of the centrifugal force from the Earth&#x27;s rotation.

The operational definition, as usually given, does not explicitly exclude the effects of buoyancy, which reduces the measured weight of an object when it is immersed in a fluid such as air or water. As a result, a floating balloon or an object floating in water might be said to have zero weight.

===ISO definition===
In the ISO International standard ISO 80000-4:2006, describing the basic physical quantities and units in mechanics as a part of the International standard ISO/IEC 80000, the definition of &quot;weight&quot; is given as:
The definition is dependent on the chosen frame of reference. When the chosen frame is co-moving with the object in question then this definition precisely agrees with the operational definition. If the specified frame is the surface of the Earth, the weight according to the ISO and gravitational definitions differ only by the centrifugal effects due to the rotation of the Earth.

=== Apparent weight ===
In many real world situations the act of weighing may produce a result that differs from the ideal value provided by the definition used. This is usually referred to as the apparent weight of the object. A common example of this is the effect of buoyancy, when an object is immersed in a fluid the displacement of the fluid will cause an upward force on the object, making it appear lighter when weighed on a scale. The apparent weight may be similarly affected by levitation and mechanical suspension. When the gravitational definition of weight is used, the operational weight measured by an accelerating scale is often also referred to as the apparent weight.

==Mass==

In modern scientific usage, weight and mass are fundamentally different quantities: mass is an intrinsic property of matter, whereas weight is a &quot;force&quot; that results from the action of gravity on matter: it measures how strongly the force of gravity pulls on that matter. However, in most practical everyday situations the word &quot;weight&quot; is used when, strictly, &quot;mass&quot; is meant. For example, most people would say that an object &quot;weighs one kilogram&quot;, even though the kilogram is a unit of mass.

The distinction between mass and weight is unimportant for many practical purposes because the strength of gravity does not vary too much on the surface of the Earth. In a uniform gravitational field, the gravitational force exerted on an object (its weight) is directly proportional to its mass. For example, object A weighs 10 times as much as object B, so therefore the mass of object A is 10 times greater than that of object B. This means that an object&#x27;s mass can be measured indirectly by its weight, and so, for everyday purposes, weighing (using a weighing scale) is an entirely acceptable way of measuring mass. Similarly, a balance measures mass indirectly by comparing the weight of the measured item to that of an object(s) of known mass. Since the measured item and the comparison mass are in virtually the same location, so experiencing the same gravitational field, the effect of varying gravity does not affect the comparison or the resulting measurement.

The Earth&#x27;s gravitational field is not uniform but can vary by as much as 0.5% at different locations on Earth (see Earth&#x27;s gravity). These variations alter the relationship between weight and mass, and must be taken into account in high-precision weight measurements that are intended to indirectly measure mass. Spring scales, which measure local weight, must be calibrated at the location at which the objects will be used to show this standard weight, to be legal for commerce.

This table shows the variation of acceleration due to gravity (and hence the variation of weight) at various locations on the Earth&#x27;s surface.

The historical use of &quot;weight&quot; for &quot;mass&quot; also persists in some scientific terminology – for example, the chemical terms &quot;atomic weight&quot;, &quot;molecular weight&quot;, and &quot;formula weight&quot;, can still be found rather than the preferred &quot;atomic mass&quot;, etc.

In a different gravitational field, for example, on the surface of the Moon, an object can have a significantly different weight than on Earth. The gravity on the surface of the Moon is only about one-sixth as strong as on the surface of the Earth. A one-kilogram mass is still a one-kilogram mass (as mass is an intrinsic property of the object) but the downward force due to gravity, and therefore its weight, is only one-sixth of what the object would have on Earth. So a man of mass 180 pounds weighs only about 30 pounds-force when visiting the Moon. If an object with a mass of one hundred kilograms was suspended by a cable off from a truss bolted to the ground on the surface of the Moon and Earth, it would still be as difficult to make the object on the Moon start to move as it would be on Earth, and likewise, it would be as difficult to stop or slow such an object in motion.

===SI units===
In most modern scientific work, physical quantities are measured in SI units. The SI unit of weight is the same as that of force: the newton (N) – a derived unit which can also be expressed in SI base units as kg⋅m/s2 (kilograms times metres per second squared).

In commercial and everyday use, the term &quot;weight&quot; is usually used to mean mass, and the verb &quot;to weigh&quot; means &quot;to determine the mass of&quot; or &quot;to have a mass of&quot;. Used in this sense, the proper SI unit is the kilogram (kg).

===Pound and other non-SI units===
In United States customary units, the pound can be either a unit of force or a unit of mass. Related units used in some distinct, separate subsystems of units include the poundal and the slug. The poundal is defined as the force necessary to accelerate an object of one-pound &quot;mass&quot; at 1ft/s2, and is equivalent to about 1/32.2 of a pound-&quot;force&quot;. The slug is defined as the amount of mass that accelerates at 1ft/s2 when one pound-force is exerted on it, and is equivalent to about 32.2 pounds (mass).

The kilogram-force is a non-SI unit of force, defined as the force exerted by a one-kilogram mass in standard Earth gravity (equal to 9.80665 newtons exactly). The dyne is the cgs unit of force and is not a part of SI, while weights measured in the cgs unit of mass, the gram, remain a part of SI.

==Sensation==

The sensation of weight is caused by the force exerted by fluids in the vestibular system, a three-dimensional set of tubes in the inner ear. It is actually the sensation of g-force, regardless of whether this is due to being stationary in the presence of gravity, or, if the person is in motion, the result of any other forces acting on the body such as in the case of acceleration or deceleration of a lift, or centrifugal forces when turning sharply.

== Measuring ==

Weight is commonly measured using one of two methods. A spring scale or hydraulic or pneumatic scale measures local weight, the local force of gravity on the object (strictly &quot;apparent&quot; weight force). Since the local force of gravity can vary by up to 0.5% at different locations, spring scales will measure slightly different weights for the same object (the same mass) at different locations. To standardize weights, scales are always calibrated to read the weight an object would have at a nominal standard gravity of 9.80665m/s2 (approx. 32.174ft/s2). However, this calibration is done at the factory. When the scale is moved to another location on Earth, the force of gravity will be different, causing a slight error. So to be highly accurate and legal for commerce, spring scales must be re-calibrated at the location at which they will be used.

A &quot;balance&quot; on the other hand, compares the weight of an unknown object in one scale pan to the weight of standard masses in the other, using a lever mechanism – a lever-balance. The standard masses are often referred to, non-technically, as &quot;weights&quot;. Since any variations in gravity will act equally on the unknown and the known weights, a lever-balance will indicate the same value at any location on Earth. Therefore, balance &quot;weights&quot; are usually calibrated and marked in mass units, so the lever-balance measures mass by comparing the Earth&#x27;s attraction on the unknown object and standard masses in the scale pans. In the absence of a gravitational field, away from planetary bodies (e.g. space), a lever-balance would not work, but on the Moon, for example, it would give the same reading as on Earth. Some balances are marked in weight units, but since the weights are calibrated at the factory for standard gravity, the balance will measure standard weight, i.e. what the object would weigh at standard gravity, not the actual local force of gravity on the object.

If the actual force of gravity on the object is needed, this can be calculated by multiplying the mass measured by the balance by the acceleration due to gravity – either standard gravity (for everyday work) or the precise local gravity (for precision work). Tables of the gravitational acceleration at different locations can be found on the web.

Gross weight is a term that is generally found in commerce or trade applications, and refers to the total weight of a product and its packaging. Conversely, net weight refers to the weight of the product alone, discounting the weight of its container or packaging; and tare weight is the weight of the packaging alone.

==Relative weights on the Earth and other celestial bodies==

The table below shows comparative gravitational accelerations at the surface of the Sun, the Earth&#x27;s moon, each of the planets in the solar system. The &quot;surface&quot; is taken to mean the cloud tops of the giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune). For the Sun, the surface is taken to mean the photosphere. The values in the table have not been de-rated for the centrifugal effect of planet rotation (and cloud-top wind speeds for the giant planets) and therefore, generally speaking, are similar to the actual gravity that would be experienced near the poles.

<text>The is one of the traditionally made Japanese swords (&quot;&quot;) worn by the samurai in feudal Japan. Its name refers to the practice of wearing it inserted through one&#x27;s &quot;obi&quot; or sash at one&#x27;s side, whereas the larger &quot;tachi&quot; sword was worn slung from a cord.

==History and use==
The production of swords in Japan is divided into specific time periods:

* &quot;Jokotō&quot; (ancient swords, until around AD 900)
* &quot;Kotō&quot; (old swords from around 900–1596)
* &quot;Shintō&quot; (new swords 1596–1780)
* &quot;Shinshintō&quot; (newer swords 1781–1876)
* &quot;Gendaitō&quot; (modern or contemporary swords 1876–present)

The &quot;wakizashi&quot; has a blade between in length. &quot;Wakizashi&quot; close to the length of a &quot;katana&quot; are called &quot;ō-wakizashi&quot; and &quot;wakizashi&quot; closer to &quot;tantō&quot; length are called &quot;ko-wakizashi&quot;. &quot;Wakizashi&quot; are not necessarily just a smaller version of the &quot;katana&quot;; they could be forged differently and have a different cross-section.

&quot;Wakizashi&quot; have been in use as far back as the 15th or 16th century. The &quot;wakizashi&quot; was used as a backup or auxiliary sword; it was also used for close quarters fighting, to behead a defeated opponent and sometimes to commit seppuku. The &quot;wakizashi&quot; was one of several short swords available for use by samurai including the &quot;yoroi tōshi&quot;, and the &quot;chisa-katana&quot;. The term &quot;wakizashi&quot; did not originally specify swords of any official blade length and was an abbreviation of &quot;wakizashi no katana&quot; (&quot;sword thrust at one&#x27;s side&quot;); the term was applied to companion swords of all sizes.
During the Edo period, the Tokugawa shogunate required samurai to wear &quot;Katana&quot; and shorter swords in pairs. These short swords were &quot;wakizashi&quot; and &quot;tanto&quot;, and &quot;wakizashi&quot; were mainly selected. The &quot;wakizashi&quot; being worn together with the &quot;katana&quot; was the official sign that the wearer was a samurai. When worn together, the pair of swords were called &quot;daishō&quot;, which translates literally as &quot;big-little&quot;. Only &quot;samurai&quot; could wear the &quot;daishō&quot;: it represented their social power and personal honour. During this period, commoners were allowed to wear one legal-length &quot;ko-wakizashi&quot;, which made it popular for the general public to wear wakizashi. This was common when traveling because of the risk of encountering bandits. &quot;Wakizashi&quot; were worn on the left side, secured to the waist sash (&quot;&quot;). It was not until the Edo period in 1638 when the rulers of Japan tried to regulate the types of swords and the social strata which were allowed to wear them that the lengths of &quot;katana&quot; and &quot;wakizashi&quot; were officially set.
Kanzan Satō, in his book titled &quot;The Japanese Sword&quot;, notes that there did not seem to be any particular need for the &quot;wakizashi&quot; and suggests that the &quot;wakizashi&quot; may have become more popular than the &quot;tantō&quot; because it was more suited for indoor fighting. He mentions the custom of leaving the &quot;katana&quot; at the door of a castle or palace when entering, while continuing to wear the &quot;wakizashi&quot; inside.

<text>Windows 2000 is a major release of the Windows NT operating system developed by Microsoft and oriented towards businesses. It is the direct successor to Windows NT 4.0, and was released to manufacturing on December 15, 1999, officially released to retail on February 17, 2000 for all versions, and on September 26, 2000 for Windows 2000 Datacenter Server. It was Microsoft&#x27;s primary business-oriented operating system until the introduction of Windows XP Professional in 2001.

Windows 2000 introduces NTFS 3.0, Encrypting File System, and basic and dynamic disk storage. Support for people with disabilities is improved over Windows NT 4.0 with a number of new assistive technologies, and Microsoft increased support for different languages and locale information. The Windows 2000 Server family has additional features, most notably the introduction of Active Directory, which in the years following became a widely used directory service in business environments.

Four editions of Windows 2000 have been released: &quot;Professional&quot;, &quot;Server&quot;, &quot;Advanced Server&quot;, and &quot;Datacenter Server&quot;; the latter was both released to manufacturing and launched months after the other editions. While each edition of Windows 2000 is targeted at a different market, they share a core set of features, including many system utilities such as the Microsoft Management Console and standard system administration applications.

Microsoft marketed Windows 2000 as the most secure Windows version ever at the time; however, it became the target of a number of high-profile virus attacks such as Code Red and Nimda. For ten years after its release, it continued to receive patches for security vulnerabilities nearly every month until reaching the end of support on July 13, 2010, the same day that support ended for Windows XP SP2.

Windows 2000 and Windows 2000 Server were succeeded by Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, released in 2001 and 2003, respectively.

Although unreleased, it was developed on Alpha in alpha, beta, and release candidate versions. Its successor, Windows XP, only supports x86, x64 and Itanium processors.

Both the Original Xbox and the Xbox 360 use a modified version of Windows 2000 as their system software.

== History ==

Windows 2000, originally named Windows NT 5.0, is a continuation of the Microsoft Windows NT family of operating systems, replacing Windows NT 4.0. Chairman and CEO Bill Gates was originally &quot;pretty confident&quot; Windows NT 5.0 would ship in the first half of 1998, revealing that the first set of beta builds had been shipped in early 1997; these builds were identical to Windows NT 4.0. The first official beta was released in September 1997, followed by Beta 2 in August 1998. On October 27, 1998, Microsoft announced that the name of the final version of the operating system would be Windows 2000, a name which referred to its projected release date. Windows 2000 Beta 3 was released in May 1999. Windows NT 5.0 Beta 1 was similar to Windows NT 4.0, including a very similarly themed logo. Windows NT 5.0 Beta 2 introduced a new &#x27;mini&#x27; boot screen, and removed the &#x27;dark space&#x27; theme in the logo. The Windows NT 5.0 betas had very long startup and shutdown sounds, though these were changed in the early Windows 2000 beta, but during Beta 3, a new piano-made startup and shutdown sounds were made, composed by Steven Ray Allen. It was featured in the final version as well as in Windows Me. The new login prompt from the final version made its first appearance in Beta 3 build 1946 (the first build of Beta 3). The new, updated icons (for &quot;My Computer&quot;, &quot;Recycle Bin&quot; etc.) first appeared in Beta 3 build 1964. The Windows 2000 boot screen in the final version first appeared in Beta 3 build 1983. Windows 2000 did not have an actual codename because, according to Dave Thompson of Windows NT team, &quot;Jim Allchin didn&#x27;t like codenames&quot;., although Windows 2000 Service Pack 1 was codenamed &quot;Asteroid&quot;.

During development, builds for the Alpha architecture were compiled, but the project was abandoned in the final stages of development (between RC1 and RC2) after Compaq announced they had dropped support for Windows NT on Alpha. From here, Microsoft issued three release candidates between July and November 1999, and finally released the operating system to partners on December 12, 1999, followed by manufacturing three days later on December 15. The public could buy the full version of Windows 2000 on February 17, 2000. Three days before this event, which Microsoft advertised as &quot;a standard in reliability,&quot; a leaked memo from Microsoft reported on by Mary Jo Foley revealed that Windows 2000 had &quot;over 63,000 potential known defects.&quot; After Foley&#x27;s article was published, she claimed that Microsoft blacklisted her for a considerable time. However, Abraham Silberschatz et al. claim in their computer science textbook that &quot;Windows 2000 was the most reliable, stable operating system Microsoft had ever shipped to that point. Much of this reliability came from maturity in the source code, extensive stress testing of the system, and automatic detection of many serious errors in drivers.&quot; InformationWeek summarized the release &quot;our tests show the successor to Windows NT 4.0 is everything we hoped it would be. Of course, it isn&#x27;t perfect either.&quot; &quot;Wired News&quot; later described the results of the February launch as &quot;lackluster.&quot; Novell criticized Microsoft&#x27;s Active Directory, the new directory service architecture, as less scalable or reliable than its own Novell Directory Services (NDS) alternative.

Windows 2000 was initially planned to replace both Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0. However, this would be changed later, as an updated version of Windows 98 called Windows 98 Second Edition was released in 1999.

On or shortly before February 12, 2004, &quot;portions of the Microsoft Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4.0 source code were illegally made available on the Internet.&quot; The source of the leak was later traced to Mainsoft, a Windows Interface Source Environment partner. Microsoft issued the following statement:
 &quot;Microsoft source code is both copyrighted and protected as a trade secret. As such, it is illegal to post it, make it available to others, download it or use it.&quot; 
Despite the warnings, the archive containing the leaked code spread widely on the file-sharing networks. On February 16, 2004, an exploit &quot;allegedly discovered by an individual studying the leaked source code&quot; for certain versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer was reported. On April 15, 2015, GitHub took down a repository containing a copy of the Windows NT 4.0 source code that originated from the leak.

Microsoft planned to release in 2000 a version of Windows 2000, specially codenamed &quot;Janus&quot;, which would run on 64-bit Intel Itanium microprocessors. However, the first officially released 64-bit version of Windows was &quot;Windows XP 64-Bit Edition&quot;, released alongside the 32-bit editions of Windows XP on October 25, 2001, followed by the server versions &quot;Windows Datacenter Server Limited Edition&quot; and later &quot;Windows Advanced Server Limited Edition&quot;, which were based on the pre-release Windows Server 2003 (then known as &quot;Windows .NET Server&quot;) codebase. These editions were released in 2002, were shortly available through the OEM channel and then were superseded by the final versions of Server 2003.

== New and updated features ==
Windows 2000 introduced many of the new features of Windows 98 and 98 SE into the NT line, such as the Windows Desktop Update, Internet Explorer 5 (Internet Explorer 6, which followed in 2001, is also available for Windows 2000), Outlook Express, NetMeeting, FAT32 support, SSE and SSE2 support, Windows Driver Model, Internet Connection Sharing, Windows Media Player 6.4, WebDAV support etc. Certain new features are common across all editions of Windows 2000, among them NTFS 3.0, the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), UDF support, the Encrypting File System (EFS), Logical Disk Manager, Image Color Management 2.0, support for PostScript 3-based printers, OpenType codice_1 and Type 1 PostScript codice_2 font support (including a new font—Palatino Linotype—to showcase some OpenType features), the Data protection API (DPAPI), an LDAP/Active Directory-enabled Address Book, usability enhancements and multi-language and locale support. Windows 2000 also introduced USB device class drivers for USB printers, Mass storage class devices, and improved FireWire SBP-2 support for printers and scanners, along with a &quot;Safe removal&quot; applet for removable storage devices. Windows 2000 SP4 added native USB 2.0 support, Wireless Zero Configuration support and SSE3 support. Windows 2000 is also the first Windows version to support hibernation at the operating system level (OS-controlled ACPI S4 sleep state) unlike Windows 98 which required special drivers from the hardware manufacturer or driver developer.

A new capability designed to protect critical system files called Windows File Protection was introduced. This protects critical Windows system files by preventing programs other than Microsoft&#x27;s operating system update mechanisms such as the &quot;Package Installer&quot;, Windows Installer and other update components from modifying them. The System File Checker utility provides users the ability to perform a manual scan of the integrity of all protected system files, and optionally repair them, either by restoring from a cache stored in a separate &quot;DLLCACHE&quot; directory, or from the original install media.

Microsoft recognized that a serious error (a Blue Screen of Death or stop error) could cause problems for servers that needed to be constantly running and so provided a system setting that would allow the server to automatically reboot when a stop error occurred. Also included is an option to dump any of the first 64 KB of memory to disk (the smallest amount of memory that is useful for debugging purposes, also known as a minidump), a dump of only the kernel&#x27;s memory, or a dump of the entire contents of memory to disk, as well as write that this event happened to the Windows 2000 event log. In order to improve performance on servers running Windows 2000, Microsoft gave administrators the choice of optimizing the operating system&#x27;s memory and processor usage patterns for background services or for applications. Windows 2000 also introduced core system administration and management features, such as the Windows Installer, Windows Management Instrumentation and Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) into the operating system.

=== Plug and Play and hardware support improvements ===
The most notable improvement from Windows NT 4.0 is the addition of Plug and Play with full ACPI and Windows Driver Model support. Similar to Windows 9x, Windows 2000 supports automatic recognition of installed hardware, hardware resource allocation, loading of appropriate drivers, PnP APIs and device notification events. The addition of the kernel PnP Manager along with the Power Manager are two significant subsystems added in Windows 2000.

Windows 2000 introduced version 3 print drivers (user mode printer drivers) based on Unidrv, which made it easier for printer manufacturers to write device drivers for printers. Generic support for 5-button mice is also included as standard and installing IntelliPoint allows reassigning the programmable buttons. Windows 98 lacked generic support. Driver Verifier was introduced to stress test and catch device driver bugs.

===Shell===
Windows 2000 introduces layered windows that allow for transparency, translucency and various transition effects like shadows, gradient fills and alpha-blended GUI elements to top-level windows. Menus support a new &quot;Fade&quot; transition effect.
The Start menu in Windows 2000 introduces &quot;personalized menus&quot;, expandable special folders and the ability to launch multiple programs without closing the menu by holding down the codice_3 key. A &quot;Re-sort&quot; button forces the entire Start Menu to be sorted by name. The Taskbar introduces support for balloon notifications which can also be used by application developers. Windows 2000 Explorer introduces customizable Windows Explorer toolbars, auto-complete in Windows Explorer address bar and Run box, advanced file type association features, displaying comments in shortcuts as tooltips, extensible columns in Details view (IColumnProvider interface), icon overlays, integrated search pane in Windows Explorer, sort by name function for menus, and &quot;Places bar&quot; in common dialogs for &quot;Open&quot; and &quot;Save&quot;.

Windows Explorer has been enhanced in several ways in Windows 2000. It is the first Windows NT release to include Active Desktop, first introduced as a part of Internet Explorer 4.0 (specifically Windows Desktop Update), and only pre-installed in Windows 98 by that time. It allowed users to customize the way folders look and behave by using HTML templates, having the file extension codice_4. This feature was abused by computer viruses that employed malicious scripts, Java applets, or ActiveX controls in folder template files as their infection vector. Two such viruses are VBS/Roor-C&lt;ref name=&quot;VBS/Roor-C&quot;&gt;&quot;Sophos&quot;, VBS/Roor-C threat analysis . Retrieved August 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and VBS.Redlof.a.

The &quot;Web-style&quot; folders view, with the left Explorer pane displaying details for the object currently selected, is turned on by default in Windows 2000. For certain file types, such as pictures and media files, the preview is also displayed in the left pane. Until the dedicated interactive preview pane appeared in Windows Vista, Windows 2000 had been the only Windows release to feature an interactive media player as the previewer for sound and video files, enabled by default. However, such a previewer can be enabled in previous versions of Windows with the Windows Desktop Update installed through the use of folder customization templates. The default file tooltip displays file title, author, subject and comments; this metadata may be read from a special NTFS stream, if the file is on an NTFS volume, or from an OLE structured storage stream, if the file is a structured storage document. All Microsoft Office documents since Office 4.0 make use of structured storage, so their metadata is displayable in the Windows 2000 Explorer default tooltip. File shortcuts can also store comments which are displayed as a tooltip when the mouse hovers over the shortcut. The shell introduces extensibility support through metadata handlers, icon overlay handlers and column handlers in Explorer &quot;Details view&quot;.

The right pane of Windows 2000 Explorer, which usually just lists files and folders, can also be customized. For example, the contents of the system folders aren&#x27;t displayed by default, instead showing in the right pane a warning to the user that modifying the contents of the system folders could harm their computer. It&#x27;s possible to define additional Explorer panes by using DIV elements in folder template files. This degree of customizability is new to Windows 2000; neither Windows 98 nor the Desktop Update could provide it. The new DHTML-based search pane is integrated into Windows 2000 Explorer, unlike the separate search dialog found in all previous Explorer versions. The Indexing Service has also been integrated into the operating system and the search pane built into Explorer allows searching files indexed by its database.

=== NTFS 3.0 ===
Microsoft released the version 3.0 of NTFS (sometimes incorrectly called &quot;NTFS 5&quot; in relation to the kernel version number) as part of Windows 2000; this introduced disk quotas (provided by QuotaAdvisor), file-system-level encryption, sparse files and reparse points. Sparse files allow for the efficient storage of data sets that are very large yet contain many areas that only have zeros. Reparse points allow the object manager to reset a file namespace lookup and let file system drivers implement changed functionality in a transparent manner. Reparse points are used to implement volume mount points, junctions, Hierarchical Storage Management, Native Structured Storage and Single Instance Storage. Volume mount points and directory junctions allow for a file to be transparently referred from one file or directory location to another.

Windows 2000 also introduces a &quot;Distributed Link Tracking&quot; service to ensure file shortcuts remain working even if the target is moved or renamed. The target object&#x27;s unique identifier is stored in the shortcut file on NTFS 3.0 and Windows can use the Distributed Link Tracking service for tracking the targets of shortcuts, so that the shortcut file may be silently updated if the target moves, even to another hard drive.

=== Encrypting File System ===
The Encrypting File System (EFS) introduced strong file system-level encryption to Windows. It allows any folder or drive on an NTFS volume to be encrypted transparently by the user. EFS works together with the EFS service, Microsoft&#x27;s CryptoAPI and the EFS File System Runtime Library (FSRTL). To date, its encryption has not been compromised.

EFS works by encrypting a file with a bulk symmetric key (also known as the File Encryption Key, or FEK), which is used because it takes less time to encrypt and decrypt large amounts of data than if an asymmetric key cipher were used. The symmetric key used to encrypt the file is then encrypted with a public key associated with the user who encrypted the file, and this encrypted data is stored in the header of the encrypted file. To decrypt the file, the file system uses the private key of the user to decrypt the symmetric key stored in the file header. It then uses the symmetric key to decrypt the file. Because this is done at the file system level, it is transparent to the user.

For a user losing access to their key, support for recovery agents that can decrypt files is built into EFS. A Recovery Agent is a user who is authorized by a public key recovery certificate to decrypt files belonging to other users using a special &quot;private key&quot;. By default, local administrators are &quot;recovery agents&quot; however they can be customized using Group Policy.

=== Basic and dynamic disk storage ===
Windows 2000 introduced the Logical Disk Manager and the diskpart command line tool for dynamic storage. All versions of Windows 2000 support three types of dynamic disk volumes (along with basic disks): &quot;simple volumes&quot;, &quot;spanned volumes&quot; and &quot;striped volumes&quot;:
* Simple volume, a volume with disk space from one disk.
* Spanned volumes, where up to 32 disks show up as one, increasing it in size but not enhancing performance. When one disk fails, the array is destroyed. Some data may be recoverable. This corresponds to SPAN and not to RAID-1.
* Striped volumes, also known as RAID-0, store all their data across several disks in &quot;stripes&quot;. This allows better performance because disk reads and writes are balanced across multiple disks. Like spanned volumes, when one disk in the array fails, the entire array is destroyed (some data may be recoverable).

In addition to these disk volumes, Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Advanced Server, and Windows 2000 Datacenter Server support &quot;mirrored volumes&quot; and &quot;striped volumes with parity&quot;:
* Mirrored volumes, also known as RAID-1, store identical copies of their data on 2 or more identical disks (&quot;mirrored&quot;). This allows for fault tolerance; in the event one disk fails, the other disk(s) can keep the server operational until the server can be shut down for replacement of the failed disk.
* Striped volumes with parity, also known as RAID-5, functions similar to striped volumes/RAID-0, except &quot;parity data&quot; is written out across each of the disks in addition to the data. This allows the data to be &quot;rebuilt&quot; in the event a disk in the array needs replacement.

=== Accessibility ===
With Windows 2000, Microsoft introduced the Windows 9x accessibility features for people with visual and auditory impairments and other disabilities into the NT-line of operating systems. These included:
* StickyKeys: makes modifier keys (codice_5, codice_6 and codice_3) become &quot;sticky&quot;: a user can press the modifier key, and then release it before pressing the combination key. (Activated by pressing Shift five times quickly.)
* FilterKeys: a group of keyboard-related features for people with typing issues, including:
** Slow Keys: Ignore any keystroke not held down for a certain period.
** Bounce Keys: Ignore repeated keystrokes pressed in quick succession.
** Repeat Keys: lets users slow down the rate at which keys are repeated via the keyboard&#x27;s key-repeat feature.
* Toggle Keys: when turned on, Windows will play a sound when the codice_8, codice_9 or codice_10 key is pressed.
* SoundSentry: designed to help users with auditory impairments, Windows 2000 shows a visual effect when a sound is played through the sound system.
* MouseKeys: lets users move the cursor around the screen via the numeric keypad.
* SerialKeys: lets Windows 2000 support speech augmentation devices.
* High contrast theme: to assist users with visual impairments.
* Microsoft Magnifier: a screen magnifier that enlarges a part of the screen the cursor is over.

Additionally, Windows 2000 introduced the following new accessibility features:
* On-screen keyboard: displays a virtual keyboard on the screen and allows users to press its keys using a mouse or a joystick.
* Microsoft Narrator: introduced in Windows 2000, this is a screen reader that utilizes the Speech API 4, which would later be updated to Speech API 5 in Windows XP
* Utility Manager: an application designed to start, stop, and manage when accessibility features start. This was eventually replaced by the Ease of Access Center in Windows Vista.
* Accessibility Wizard: a control panel applet that helps users set up their computer for people with disabilities.

=== Languages and locales ===
Windows 2000 introduced the Multilingual User Interface (MUI). Besides English, Windows 2000 incorporates support for Arabic, Armenian, Baltic, Central European, Cyrillic, Georgian, Greek, Hebrew, Indic, Japanese, Korean, simplified Chinese, Thai, traditional Chinese, Turkic, Vietnamese and Western European languages. It also has support for many different locales.

=== Games ===
Windows 2000 included version 7.0 of the DirectX API, commonly used by game developers on Windows 98. The last version of DirectX that was released for Windows 2000 was DirectX 9.0c (Shader Model 3.0), which shipped with Windows XP Service Pack 2. Microsoft published quarterly updates to DirectX 9.0c through the February 2010 release after which support was dropped in the June 2010 SDK. These updates contain bug fixes to the core runtime and some additional libraries such as D3DX, XAudio 2, XInput and Managed DirectX components. The majority of games written for versions of DirectX 9.0c (up to the February 2010 release) can therefore run on Windows 2000.

Windows 2000 included the same games as Windows NT 4.0 did: FreeCell, Minesweeper, Pinball, and Solitaire.

=== System utilities ===
Windows 2000 introduced the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), which is used to create, save, and open administrative tools. Each of these is called a &quot;console&quot;, and most allow an administrator to administer other Windows 2000 computers from one centralised computer. Each console can contain one or many specific administrative tools, called &quot;snap-ins&quot;. These can be either standalone (with one function), or an extension (adding functions to an existing snap-in). In order to provide the ability to control what snap-ins can be seen in a console, the MMC allows consoles to be created in &quot;author mode&quot; or &quot;user mode&quot;. Author mode allows snap-ins to be added, new windows to be created, all portions of the console tree to be displayed and consoles to be saved. User mode allows consoles to be distributed with restrictions applied. User mode consoles can grant full access to the user for any change, or they can grant limited access, preventing users from adding snapins to the console though they can view multiple windows in a console. Alternatively users can be granted limited access, preventing them from adding to the console and stopping them from viewing multiple windows in a single console.

The main tools that come with Windows 2000 can be found in the &quot;Computer Management&quot; console (in Administrative Tools in the Control Panel). This contains the Event Viewer—a means of viewing system or application-related events and the Windows equivalent of a log file, a system information utility, a backup utility, Task Scheduler and management consoles to view open shared folders and shared folder sessions, configure and manage COM+ applications, configure Group Policy, manage all the local users and user groups, and a device manager. It contains &quot;Disk Management&quot; and &quot;Removable Storage&quot; snap-ins, a disk defragmenter as well as a performance diagnostic console, which displays graphs of system performance and configures data logs and alerts. It also contains a service configuration console, which allows users to view all installed services and to stop and start them, as well as configure what those services should do when the computer starts. CHKDSK has significant performance improvements.

Windows 2000 comes with two utilities to edit the Windows registry, &quot;REGEDIT.EXE&quot; and &quot;REGEDT32.EXE&quot;. REGEDIT has been directly ported from Windows 98, and therefore does not support editing registry permissions. REGEDT32 has the older multiple document interface (MDI) and can edit registry permissions in the same manner that Windows NT&#x27;s REGEDT32 program could. REGEDIT has a left-side tree view of the Windows registry, lists all loaded hives and represents the three components of a value (its name, type, and data) as separate columns of a table. REGEDT32 has a left-side tree view, but each hive has its own window, so the tree displays only keys and it represents values as a list of strings. REGEDIT supports right-clicking of entries in a tree view to adjust properties and other settings. REGEDT32 requires all actions to be performed from the top menu bar. Windows XP is the first system to integrate these two programs into a single utility, adopting the REGEDIT behavior with the additional NT features.

The System File Checker (SFC) also comes with Windows 2000. It is a command line utility that scans system files and verifies whether they were signed by Microsoft and works in conjunction with the Windows File Protection mechanism. It can also repopulate and repair all the files in the &quot;Dllcache&quot; folder.

=== Recovery Console ===


The Recovery Console is run from outside the installed copy of Windows to perform maintenance tasks that can neither be run from within it nor feasibly be run from another computer or copy of Windows 2000. It is usually used to recover the system from problems that cause booting to fail, which would render other tools useless, like Safe Mode or Last Known Good Configuration, or codice_11. It includes commands like codice_12, which are not present in MS-DOS.

It has a simple command-line interface, used to check and repair the hard drive(s), repair boot information (including NTLDR), replace corrupted system files with fresh copies from the CD, or enable/disable services and drivers for the next boot.

The console can be accessed in either of the two ways:
# Booting from the Windows 2000 CD, and choosing to start the Recovery Console from the CD itself instead of continuing with setup. The Recovery Console is accessible as long as the installation CD is available.
# Preinstalling the Recovery Console on the hard disk as a startup option in codice_13, via WinNT32.exe, with the /cmdcons switch. In this case, it can only be started as long as NTLDR can boot from the system partition.

=== Windows Scripting Host 2.0 ===

Windows 2000 introduced Windows Script Host 2.0 which included an expanded object model and support for logon and logoff scripts.

=== Networking ===
* Starting with Windows 2000, the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol directly interfaces with TCP/IP. In Windows NT 4.0, SMB requires the NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT) protocol to work on a TCP/IP network.
* Windows 2000 introduces a client-side DNS caching service. When the Windows DNS resolver receives a query response, the DNS resource record is added to a cache. When it queries the same resource record name again and it is found in the cache, then the resolver does not query the DNS server. This speeds up DNS query time and reduces network traffic.

=== Server family features ===
The Windows 2000 Server family consists of Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Advanced Server, Windows 2000 Small Business Server, and Windows 2000 Datacenter Server.

All editions of Windows 2000 Server have the following services and features built in:
* Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) support, facilitating dial-up and VPN connections using IPsec, L2TP or L2TP/IPsec, support for RADIUS authentication in Internet Authentication Service, network connection sharing, Network Address Translation, unicast and multicast routing schemes.
* Remote access security features: Remote Access Policies for setup, verify Caller ID (IP address for VPNs), callback and Remote access account lockout
* Autodial by location feature using the &quot;Remote Access Auto Connection Manager&quot; service
* Extensible Authentication Protocol support in IAS (EAP-MD5 and EAP-TLS) later upgraded to PEAPv0/EAP-MSCHAPv2 and PEAP-EAP-TLS in Windows 2000 SP4
* DNS server, including support for Dynamic DNS. Active Directory relies heavily on DNS.
* IPsec support and TCP/IP filtering
* Smart card support
* Microsoft Connection Manager Administration Kit (CMAK) and Connection Point Services
* Support for distributed file systems (DFS)
* Hierarchical Storage Management support including remote storage, a service that runs with NTFS and automatically transfers files that are not used for some time to less expensive storage media
* Fault tolerant volumes, namely Mirrored and RAID-5
* Group Policy (part of Active Directory)
* &quot;IntelliMirror&quot;, a collection of technologies for fine-grained management of Windows 2000 Professional clients that duplicates users&#x27; data, applications, files, and settings in a centralized location on the network. IntelliMirror employs technologies such as Group Policy, Windows Installer, Roaming profiles, Folder Redirection, &quot;Offline Files&quot; (also known as &quot;Client Side Caching&quot; or CSC), File Replication Service (FRS), Remote Installation Services (RIS) to address desktop management scenarios such as user data management, user settings management, software installation and maintenance.
* COM+, Microsoft Transaction Server and Distributed Transaction Coordinator
* MSMQ 2.0
* TAPI 3.0
* Integrated Windows Authentication (including Kerberos, Secure channel and SPNEGO (Negotiate) SSP packages for Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI)).
* MS-CHAP v2 protocol
* Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Enterprise Certificate Authority support
* Terminal Services and support for the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
* Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 and Windows Media Services 4.1
* Network quality of service features
* A new &quot;Windows Time service&quot; which is an implementation of Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) as detailed in IETF . The Windows Time service synchronizes the date and time of computers in a domain running on Windows 2000 Server or later. Windows 2000 Professional includes an SNTP client.

The Server editions include more features and components, including the Microsoft Distributed File System (DFS), Active Directory support and fault-tolerant storage.

==== Distributed File System ====
The Distributed File System (DFS) allows shares in multiple different locations to be logically grouped under one folder, or &quot;DFS root&quot;. When users try to access a network share off the DFS root, the user is really looking at a &quot;DFS link&quot; and the DFS server transparently redirects them to the correct file server and share. A DFS root can only exist on a Windows 2000 version that is part of the server family, and only one DFS root can exist on that server.

There can be two ways of implementing a DFS namespace on Windows 2000: either through a standalone DFS root or a domain-based DFS root. Standalone DFS allows for only DFS roots on the local computer, and thus does not use Active Directory. Domain-based DFS roots exist within Active Directory and can have their information distributed to other domain controllers within the domain – this provides fault tolerance to DFS. DFS roots that exist on a domain must be hosted on a domain controller or on a domain member server. The file and root information is replicated via the Microsoft File Replication Service (FRS).

==== Active Directory ====
A new way of organizing Windows network domains, or groups of resources, called Active Directory, is introduced with Windows 2000 to replace Windows NT&#x27;s earlier domain model. Active Directory&#x27;s hierarchical nature allowed administrators a built-in way to manage user and computer policies and user accounts, and to automatically deploy programs and updates with a greater degree of scalability and centralization than provided in previous Windows versions. User information stored in Active Directory also provided a convenient phone book-like function to end users. Active Directory domains can vary from small installations with a few hundred objects, to large installations with millions. Active Directory can organise and link groups of domains into a contiguous domain name space to form &quot;trees&quot;. Groups of trees outside of the same namespace can be linked together to form &quot;forests.&quot;

Active Directory services could always be installed on a Windows 2000 Server Standard, Advanced, or Datacenter computer, and cannot be installed on a Windows 2000 Professional computer. However, Windows 2000 Professional is the first client operating system able to exploit Active Directory&#x27;s new features. As part of an organization&#x27;s migration, Windows NT clients continued to function until all clients were upgraded to Windows 2000 Professional, at which point the Active Directory domain could be switched to native mode and maximum functionality achieved.

Active Directory requires a DNS server that supports SRV resource records, or that an organization&#x27;s existing DNS infrastructure be upgraded to support this. There should be one or more domain controllers to hold the Active Directory database and provide Active Directory directory services.

==== Volume fault tolerance ====
Along with support for simple, spanned and striped volumes, the Windows 2000 Server family also supports fault-tolerant volume types. The types supported are &quot;mirrored volumes&quot; and &quot;RAID-5 volumes&quot;:
* Mirrored volumes: the volume contains several disks, and when data is written to one it is also written to the other disks. This means that if one disk fails, the data can be totally recovered from the other disk. Mirrored volumes are also known as RAID-1.
* RAID-5 volumes: a RAID-5 volume consists of multiple disks, and it uses block-level striping with parity data distributed across all member disks. Should a disk fail in the array, the parity blocks from the surviving disks are combined mathematically with the data blocks from the surviving disks to reconstruct the data on the failed drive &quot;on-the-fly.&quot;

== Deployment ==
Windows 2000 can be deployed to a site via various methods. It can be installed onto servers via traditional media (such as CD) or via distribution folders that reside on a shared folder. Installations can be attended or unattended. During a manual installation, the administrator must specify configuration options. Unattended installations are scripted via an answer file, or a predefined script in the form of an INI file that has all the options filled in. An answer file can be created manually or using the graphical &quot;Setup manager&quot;. The Winnt.exe or Winnt32.exe program then uses that answer file to automate the installation. Unattended installations can be performed via a bootable CD, using Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS), via the System Preparation Tool (Sysprep), via the Winnt32.exe program using the /syspart switch or via Remote Installation Services (RIS). The ability to slipstream a service pack into the original operating system setup files is also introduced in Windows 2000.

The Sysprep method is started on a standardized reference computer – though the hardware need not be similar – and it copies the required installation files from the reference computer to the target computers. The hard drive does not need to be in the target computer and may be swapped out to it at any time, with the hardware configured later. The Winnt.exe program must also be passed a /unattend switch that points to a valid answer file and a /s file that points to one or more valid installation sources.

Sysprep allows the duplication of a disk image on an existing Windows 2000 Server installation to multiple servers. This means that all applications and system configuration settings will be copied across to the new installations, and thus, the reference and target computers must have the same HALs, ACPI support, and mass storage devices – though Windows 2000 automatically detects &quot;plug and play&quot; devices. The primary reason for using Sysprep is to quickly deploy Windows 2000 to a site that has multiple computers with standard hardware. (If a system had different HALs, mass storage devices or ACPI support, then multiple images would need to be maintained.)

Systems Management Server can be used to upgrade multiple computers to Windows 2000. These must be running Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 98 or Windows 95 OSR2.x along with the SMS client agent that can receive software installation operations. Using SMS allows installations over a wide area and provides centralised control over upgrades to systems.

Remote Installation Services (RIS) are a means to automatically install Windows 2000 Professional (and not Windows 2000 Server) to a local computer over a network from a central server. Images do not have to support specific hardware configurations and the security settings can be configured after the computer reboots as the service generates a new unique security ID (SID) for the machine. This is required so that local accounts are given the right identifier and do not clash with other Windows 2000 Professional computers on a network.
RIS requires that client computers are able to boot over the network via either a network interface card that has a Pre-Boot Execution Environment (PXE) boot ROM installed or that the client computer has a network card installed that is supported by the remote boot disk generator. The remote computer must also meet the Net PC specification. The server that RIS runs on must be Windows 2000 Server and it must be able to access a network DNS Service, a DHCP service and the Active Directory services.

== Editions ==
Microsoft released various editions of Windows 2000 for different markets and business needs: Professional, Server, Advanced Server and Datacenter Server. Each was packaged separately.
Windows 2000 Professional was designed as the desktop operating system for businesses and power users. It is the client version of Windows 2000. It offers greater security and stability than many of the previous Windows desktop operating systems. It supports up to two processors, and can address up to 4GB of RAM. The system requirements are a Pentium processor (or equivalent) of 133MHz or greater, at least 32MB of RAM, 650MB of hard drive space, and a CD-ROM drive (recommended: Pentium II, 128MB of RAM, 2GB of hard drive space, and CD-ROM drive). However, despite the official minimum processor requirements, it is still possible to install Windows 2000 on 4th-generation x86 CPUs such as the 80486.
Windows 2000 Embedded and Windows 2000 Professional For Embedded Systems was designed for ATMs, vending machine and other larger embedded devices.

Windows 2000 Server shares the same user interface with Windows 2000 Professional, but contains additional components for the computer to perform server roles and run infrastructure and application software. A significant new component introduced in the server versions is Active Directory, which is an enterprise-wide directory service based on LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol). Additionally, Microsoft integrated Kerberos network authentication, replacing the often-criticised NTLM (NT LAN Manager) authentication system used in previous versions. This also provided a purely transitive-trust relationship between Windows 2000 Server domains in a &quot;forest&quot; (a collection of one or more Windows 2000 domains that share a common schema, configuration, and global catalog, being linked with two-way transitive trusts). Furthermore, Windows 2000 introduced a Domain Name Server which allows dynamic registration of IP addresses. Windows 2000 Server supports up to 4 processors and 4GB of RAM, with a minimum requirement of 128MB of RAM and 1GB hard disk space, however requirements may be higher depending on installed components.
Windows 2000 Advanced Server is a variant of Windows 2000 Server operating system designed for medium-to-large businesses. It offers the ability to create clusters of servers, support for up to 8 CPUs, a main memory amount of up to 8GB on Physical Address Extension (PAE) systems and the ability to do 8-way SMP. It supports TCP/IP load balancing and builds on Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS) in Windows NT Enterprise Server 4.0, adding enhanced functionality for two-node clusters. System requirements are similar to those of Windows 2000 Server, however they may need to be higher to scale to larger infrastructure.
Windows 2000 Datacenter Server is a variant of Windows 2000 Server designed for large businesses that move large quantities of confidential or sensitive data frequently via a central server. Like Advanced Server, it supports clustering, failover and load balancing. Its minimum system requirements are similar to those of Advanced Server, but it was designed to be capable of handing advanced, fault-tolerant and scalable hardware—for instance computers with up to 32 CPUs and 32GBs RAM, with rigorous system testing and qualification, hardware partitioning, coordinated maintenance and change control. Windows 2000 Datacenter Server was released to manufacturing on August 11, 2000 and launched on September 26, 2000. This edition was based on Windows 2000 with Service Pack 1 and was not available at retail.

== Service packs ==

Windows 2000 has received four full service packs and one rollup update package following SP4, which is the last service pack. Microsoft phased out all development of its Java Virtual Machine (JVM) from Windows 2000 in SP3. Internet Explorer 5.01 has also been upgraded to the corresponding service pack level.

Service Pack 4 with Update Rollup was released on September 13, 2005, nearly four years following the release of Windows XP and sixteen months prior to the release of Windows Vista.

Microsoft had originally intended to release a fifth service pack for Windows 2000, but cancelled this project early in its development, and instead released Update Rollup 1 for SP4, a collection of all the security-related hotfixes and some other significant issues. The Update Rollup does not include all non-security related hotfixes and is not subjected to the same extensive regression testing as a full service pack. Microsoft states that this update will meet customers&#x27; needs better than a whole new service pack, and will still help Windows 2000 customers secure their PCs, reduce support costs, and support existing computer hardware.

== Upgradeability ==
Several Windows 2000 components are upgradable to latest versions, which include new versions introduced in later versions of Windows, and other major Microsoft applications are available. These latest versions for Windows 2000 include:
* ActiveSync 4.5
* DirectX 9.0c (5 February 2010 Redistributable)
* Internet Explorer 6 SP1 and Outlook Express 6 SP1
* Microsoft Agent 2.0
* Microsoft Data Access Components 2.81
* Microsoft NetMeeting 3.01
* Microsoft Virtual PC 2004 SP1
* Office 2003 SP3
* MSN Messenger 7.0 (Windows Messenger)
* MSXML 6.0 SP2
* .NET Framework 2.0 SP2
* Tweak UI 1.33
* Visual C++ 2008
* Visual Studio 2005
* Windows Desktop Search 2.66
* Windows Script Host 5.7
* Windows Installer 3.1
* Windows Media Format Runtime and Windows Media Player 9 Series (including Windows Media Encoder 7.1 and the Windows Media 8 Encoding Utility)

== Security ==
During the Windows 2000 period, the nature of attacks on Windows servers changed: more attacks came from remote sources via the Internet. This has led to an overwhelming number of malicious programs exploiting the IIS services – specifically a notorious buffer overflow tendency. This tendency is not operating-system-version specific, but rather configuration-specific: it depends on the services that are enabled. Following this, a common complaint is that &quot;by default, Windows 2000 installations contain numerous potential security problems. Many unneeded services are installed and enabled, and there is no active local security policy.&quot; In addition to insecure defaults, according to the SANS Institute, the most common flaws discovered are remotely exploitable buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Other criticized flaws include the use of vulnerable encryption techniques.

Code Red and Code Red II were famous (and much discussed) worms that exploited vulnerabilities of the Windows Indexing Service of Windows 2000&#x27;s Internet Information Services (IIS). In August 2003, security researchers estimated that two major worms called Sobig and Blaster infected more than half a million Microsoft Windows computers. The 2005 Zotob worm was blamed for security compromises on Windows 2000 machines at ABC, CNN, the New York Times Company, and the United States Department of Homeland Security.

On September 8, 2009, Microsoft skipped patching two of the five security flaws that were addressed in the monthly security update, saying that patching one of the critical security flaws was &quot;infeasible.&quot; According to Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-048: &quot;The architecture to properly support TCP/IP protection does not exist on Microsoft Windows 2000 systems, making it infeasible to build the fix for Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 to eliminate the vulnerability. To do so would require re-architecting a very significant amount of the Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 operating system, there would be no assurance that applications designed to run on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 would continue to operate on the updated system.&quot; No patches for this flaw were released for the newer Windows XP (32-bit) and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition either, despite both also being affected; Microsoft suggested turning on Windows Firewall in those versions.

== Support lifecycle ==

Windows 2000 and Windows 2000 Server were superseded by newer Microsoft operating systems: Windows 2000 Server products by Windows Server 2003, and Windows 2000 Professional by Windows XP Professional.

The Windows 2000 family of operating systems moved from mainstream support to the extended support phase on June 30, 2005. Microsoft says that this marks the progression of Windows 2000 through the Windows lifecycle policy. Under mainstream support, Microsoft freely provides design changes if any, service packs and non-security related updates in addition to security updates, whereas in extended support, service packs are not provided and non-security updates require contacting the support personnel by e-mail or phone. Under the extended support phase, Microsoft continued to provide critical security updates every month for all components of Windows 2000 (including Internet Explorer 5.0 SP4) and paid per-incident support for technical issues. Because of Windows 2000&#x27;s age, updated versions of components such as Windows Media Player 11 and Internet Explorer 7 have not been released for it. In the case of Internet Explorer, Microsoft said in 2005 that, &quot;some of the security work in IE 7 relies on operating system functionality in XP SP2 that is non-trivial to port back to Windows 2000.&quot;

While users of Windows 2000 Professional and Server were eligible to purchase the upgrade license for Windows Vista Business or Windows Server 2008, neither of these operating systems can directly perform an upgrade installation from Windows 2000; a clean installation must be performed instead or a two-step upgrade through XP/2003. Microsoft has dropped the upgrade path from Windows 2000 (and earlier) to Windows 7. Users of Windows 2000 must buy a full Windows 7 license.

Although Windows 2000 is the last NT-based version of Microsoft Windows which does not include product activation, Microsoft has introduced Windows Genuine Advantage for certain downloads and non-critical updates from the Download Center for Windows 2000.

Windows 2000 reached the end of its lifecycle (EoL) on July 13, 2010 (alongside Service Pack 2 of Windows XP). It will not receive new security updates and new security-related hotfixes after this date. In Japan, over 130,000 servers and 500,000 PCs in local governments were affected; many local governments said that they will not update as they do not have funds to cover a replacement.

As of 2011, Windows Update still supports the Windows 2000 updates available on Patch Tuesday in July 2010, e.g., if older optional Windows 2000 features are enabled later. Microsoft Office products under Windows 2000 have their own product lifecycles. While Internet Explorer 6 for Windows XP did receive security patches up until it lost support, this is not the case for IE6 under Windows 2000. The Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool installed monthly by Windows Update for XP and later versions can be still downloaded manually for Windows 2000.

In 2020, Microsoft announced that it would disable the Windows Update service for SHA-1 endpoints for older Windows versions. Since Windows 2000 did not get an update for SHA-2, Windows Update Services are no longer available on the OS as of late July 2020. As of March 2024, many of the old updates for Windows 2000 are available on the Microsoft Update Catalog. A third-party tool named Legacy Update allows previously-released updates for Windows 2000 to be installed from the Update Catalog. An independent project named Windows Update Restored is also available since 2022 and aims to restore the Windows Update websites for older versions of Windows, including Windows 2000.

== Total cost of ownership ==
In October 2002, Microsoft commissioned IDC to determine the total cost of ownership (TCO) for enterprise applications on Windows 2000 versus the TCO of the same applications on Linux. IDC&#x27;s report is based on telephone interviews of IT executives and managers of 104 North American companies in which they determined what they were using for a specific workload for file, print, security and networking services.
IDC determined that the four areas where Windows 2000 had a better TCO than Linux – over a period of five years for an average organization of 100 employees – were file, print, network infrastructure and security infrastructure. They determined, however, that Linux had a better TCO than Windows 2000 for web serving. The report also found that the greatest cost was not in the procurement of software and hardware, but in staffing costs and downtime. While the report applied a 40% productivity factor during IT infrastructure downtime, recognizing that employees are not entirely unproductive, it did not consider the impact of downtime on the profitability of the business. The report stated that Linux servers had less unplanned downtime than Windows 2000 servers. It found that most Linux servers ran less workload per server than Windows 2000 servers and also that none of the businesses interviewed used 4-way SMP Linux computers. The report also did not take into account specific application servers – servers that need low maintenance and are provided by a specific vendor. The report did emphasize that TCO was only one factor in considering whether to use a particular IT platform, and also noted that as management and server software improved and became better packaged the overall picture shown could change.

<text>William (929 – 2 March 968) was Archbishop of Mainz from 17 December 954 until his death. He was the son of the Emperor Otto I the Great and a Wendish mother.

On 17 December 954, he was appointed to the archbishopric of Mainz following the death of the rebellious former archbishop Frederick. William received confirmation from Pope Agapetus II and also the title of Apostolic Vicar of Germany, a title which made the archbishops of Mainz the pope&#x27;s deputies in Germany and granted the archdiocese of Mainz the title of Holy See. From his father, William also received the title of &quot;Arch-Chaplain of the Empire.&quot;

William died at Rottleberode in 968 and was buried in St. Alban&#x27;s Abbey, Mainz.

<text>Walloons (; ; ) are a Gallo-Romance ethnic group native to Wallonia and the immediate adjacent regions of Flanders, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Walloons primarily speak &quot;langues d&#x27;oïl&quot; such as Belgian French, Picard and Walloon. Walloons are primarily Roman Catholic, with a historical minority of Protestantism which dates back to the Reformation era.

In modern Belgium, Walloons are, by law, termed a &quot;distinctive linguistic and ethnic community&quot; within the country, as are the neighbouring Flemish, a Dutch (Germanic) speaking community.

When understood as a regional identification, the ethnonym is also extended to refer to the inhabitants of the Walloon region in general, regardless of ethnicity or ancestry.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Walloon&quot; is derived from &quot;*walha&quot;, a Proto-Germanic term used to refer to Celtic and Latin speakers.

&quot;Walloon&quot; originated in Romance languages alongside other related terms, but it supplanted them. Its oldest written trace is found in Jean de Haynin&#x27;s &quot;Mémoires de Jean, sire de Haynin et de Louvignies&quot; in 1465, where it refers to Roman populations of the Burgundian Netherlands. Its meaning narrowed yet again during the French and Dutch periods and, at Belgian independence, the term designated only Belgians speaking a Romance language (French, Walloon, Picard, etc.) The linguistic cleavage in the politics of Belgium adds a political content to &quot;the emotional cultural, and linguistic concept&quot;. The words &quot;Walloon&quot; and &quot;Wallons&quot; can be seen in the book of Charles White, &quot;The Belgic Revolution&quot; (1835): &quot;The restless Wallons, with that adventurous daring which is their historical characteristic, abandoned their occupations, and eagerly seizing the pike and the musket marched towards the centre of the commotion.&quot; The Spanish terms of Walon and Walona from the 17th century referred to a Royal Guard Corps recruited in the Spanish Flanders. They were involved in many of the most significant battles of the Spanish Empire.

Albert Henry wrote that although in 1988 the word &quot;Walloon&quot; evoked a constitutional reality, it originally referred to Roman populations of the Burgundian Netherlands and was also used to designate a territory by the terms &quot;provinces wallonnes&quot; or &quot;pays wallon&quot; (Walloon country), from the 16th century to the Belgian revolution, and later Wallonia. The term &#x27;Walloon country&#x27; was also used in Dutch viz. &quot;Walsch land&quot;. The term existed also in German, perhaps &quot;Wulland&quot; in Hans Heyst&#x27;s 1571 book, where that word is later (1814) translated to Wallonia in English. In German it is however generally &quot;Wallonenland&quot;. In English, it is Walloon country (see further James Shaw). In French it is &quot;le Pays wallon&quot;. For Félix Rousseau, Walloon country is, after &quot;le Roman pays&quot; the old name of the country of the Walloons.

===Institutional aspects===

The term &quot;state reform&quot; in the Belgian context indicates a process towards finding constitutional and legal solutions for the problems and tensions among the different segments of the Belgian population, mostly Dutch-speakers of Flanders and French-speakers of Wallonia. In general, Belgium evolved from a unitary state to a federal state with communities, regions and language areas.

==Conceptual aspects==

===Wallonia===

The area now known as Wallonia has been settled by various Celtic tribes and later by Roman and Frankish settlers. From the early Middle Ages up until the early modern period, the region has been separated between many city-states and external powers. Such changing rule brought variations to borders, culture, and language. The Walloon language, widespread in use up until the Second World War, has been dying out of common use due in part to its prohibition by the public school system, in favor of French.

Starting from the end of the 19th century, the Walloon Movement, aiming to assert the identity of Walloons as French-speaking (rather than Walloon speaking) people of Belgium. In this context, the concept of Wallonia, as a heartland of the Walloon people was invented in 1886.

Later, this was complicated by the federal structure given to Belgium, which splits Belgium into three communities with the privilege of using their own tongues in official correspondence, but also into three autonomous regions. The communities are: French community (though not Walloon, but sometimes controversially called &quot;Wallonia-Brussels&quot;), Flemish community (which uses Dutch), and German-speaking community. The division into political regions does not correspond with the communities: Flemish Region, Walloon Region (including the German community but generally called Wallonia), and the bilingual (French-Dutch) Brussels-Capital Region.

===Brussels - not Walloon and mostly French-speaking===
Many non-French-speaking observers (over)generalize &quot;Walloons&quot; as a term of convenience for all Belgian French-speakers (even those born and living in the Brussels-Capital Region). The mixing of the population over the centuries means that most families can trace ancestors on both sides of the linguistic divide. But, the fact that Brussels is around 85% French-speaking, but is located in Dutch-speaking Flanders, has led to friction between the regions and communities. The local dialect in Brussels, &quot;Brussels Vloms&quot;, is a Brabantic dialect, reflecting the Dutch heritage of the city.

Walloons are historically credited with pioneering the Industrial Revolution in Continental Europe in the early 19th century. In modern history, Brussels has been the major town or the capital of the region. Because of long Spanish and minor French rule, French became the sole official language. After a brief period with Dutch as the official language while the region was part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, the people reinstated French after achieving independence in 1830. The Walloon region, a major coal and steel-producing area, developed rapidly into the economic powerhouse of the country. Walloons (in fact French-speaking elites who were called &quot;Walloons&quot;) became politically dominant. Many Flemish immigrants came to work in Wallonia. Between the 1930s and the 1970s, the gradual decline of steel and more especially coal, coupled with too little investment in service industries and light industry (which came to predominate in Flanders), started to tip the balance in the other direction. Flanders became gradually politically and economically dominant. In their turn, Walloon families have moved to Flanders in search of jobs. This evolution has not been without political repercussions.

===Walloon identity===
The heartland of Walloon culture are the Meuse and Sambre river valleys, Charleroi, Dinant, Namur (the regional capital), Huy, Verviers, and Liège.

====Regional language statistics====
The Walloon language is an element of Walloon identity. However, the entire French-speaking population of Wallonia cannot be culturally considered Walloon, since a significant portion in the west (around Tournai and Mons) and smaller portions in the extreme south (around Arlon) possess other languages as mother tongues (namely, Picard, Champenois, Lorrain, Flemish, German and Luxembourgish).

A survey of the &quot;Centre liégeois d&#x27;étude de l&#x27;opinion&quot; pointed out in 1989 that 71.8% of the younger people of Wallonia understand and speak only a little or no Walloon language; 17.4% speak it well; and only 10.4% speak it exclusively. Based on other surveys and figures, Laurent Hendschel wrote in 1999 that between 30 and 40% people were bilingual in Wallonia (Walloon, Picard), among them 10% of the younger population (18–30 years old). According to Hendschel, there are 36 to 58% of young people have a passive knowledge of the regional languages. On the other hand, Givet &quot;commune&quot;, several villages in the Ardennes &quot;département&quot; in France, which publishes the journal &quot;Causons wallon&quot; (Let us speak Walloon); and two villages in Luxembourg are historically Walloon-speaking.

====Walloons in the Renaissance====
In 1572 Jean Bodin made a funny play on words which has been well known in Wallonia to the present:
Translation: &quot;We are called &quot;Walloons&quot; by the Belgians because when the ancient people of Gallia were travelling the length and breadth of the earth, it happened that they asked each other: &#x27;Où allons-nous?&#x27; [Where are we going? : the pronunciation of these French words is the same as the French word &quot;Wallons&quot; (plus &#x27;us&#x27;)], i.e. &#x27;To which goal are we walking?.&#x27; It is probable they took from it the name &quot;Ouallons&quot; (&quot;Wallons&quot;), which the Latin speaking are not able to pronounce without changing the word by the use of the letter G.&quot; One of the best translations of his (humorous) sayings used daily in Wallonia is &quot;These are strange times we are living in.&quot;

Shakespeare used the word Walloon: &quot;A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin&#x27;s grace/Thrust Talbot with a spear in the back.&quot; A note in &quot;Henry VI, Part I&quot; says, &quot;At this time, the Walloons [were] the inhabitants of the area, now in south Belgium, still known as the &#x27;Pays wallon&#x27;.&quot; Albert Henry agrees, quoting Maurice Piron, also quoted by A.J. Hoenselaars: &quot;&#x27;Walloon&#x27; meaning &#x27;Walloon country&#x27; in Shakespeare&#x27;s &#x27;Henry VI&#x27;...&quot;

====Walloons and the Enlightenment====

A 1786 history of the Netherlands noted, &quot;[The] Haynault and Namur, with Artois, now no longer an Austrian Province, compose the Walloon country. The Walloon name and language are also extended into the adjacent districts of the neighbouring Provinces. A large part of Brabant, where that Province borders on Haynault and Namur, is named Walloon Brabant. The affinity of language seems also on some occasions to have wrought a nearer relation.&quot;

====The Belgian revolution of 1830====

The Belgian revolution was recently described as firstly a conflict between the Brussels municipality which was secondly disseminated in the rest of the country, &quot;particularly in the Walloon provinces&quot;. We read the nearly same opinion in Edmundson&#x27;s book: The royal forces, on the morning of September 23, entered the city at three gates and advanced as far as the Park. But beyond that point they were unable to proceed, so desperate was the resistance, and such the hail of bullets that met them from barricades and from the windows and roofs of the houses. For three days almost without cessation the fierce contest went on, the troops losing ground rather than gaining it. On the evening of the 26th the prince gave orders to retreat, his troops having suffered severely. The effect of this withdrawal was to convert a street insurrection into a national revolt. The moderates now united with the liberals, and a Provisional Government was formed, having amongst its members Charles Rogier, Van de Weyer, Gendebien, , Félix de Mérode and Louis de Potter, who a few days later returned triumphantly from banishment. The Provisional Government issued a series of decrees declaring Belgium independent, releasing the Belgian soldiers from their allegiance, and calling upon them to abandon the Dutch standard. They were obeyed. The revolt, which had been confined mainly to the Walloon districts, now spread rapidly over Flanders. Jacques Logie wrote: &quot;On the 6th October, the whole Wallonia was under the Provisional Government&#x27;s control. In the Flemish part of the country the collapse of the Royal Government was as total and quick as in Wallonia, except Ghent and Antwerp.&quot; Robert Demoulin, who was professor at the University of Liège, wrote: &quot;Liège is in the forefront of the battle for liberty&quot;, more than Brussels but with Brussels. He wrote the same thing for Leuven. According to Demoulin, these three cities are the &quot;républiques municipales&quot; at the head of the Belgian revolution. In this chapter VI of his book, &quot;Le soulèvement national&quot; (pp. 93–117), before writing &quot;On the 6th October, the whole Wallonia is free&quot;, he quotes the following municipalities from which volunteers were going to Brussels, the &quot;centre of the commotion&quot;, in order to take part in the battle against the Dutch troops: Tournai, Namur, Wavre (p. 105) Braine-l&#x27;Alleud, Genappe, Jodoigne, Perwez, Rebecq, Grez-Doiceau, , Nivelles (p. 106), Charleroi (and its region), Gosselies, Lodelinsart (p. 107), Soignies, Leuze, Thuin, Jemappes (p. 108), Dour, Saint-Ghislain, (p. 109) and he concluded: &quot;So, from the Walloon little towns and countryside, people came to the capital..&quot; The Dutch fortresses were liberated in Ath ( 27 September), Mons (29 September), Tournai (2 October), Namur (4 October) (with the help of people coming from Andenne, Fosses, Gembloux), Charleroi (5 October) (with people who came in their thousands).The same day that was also the case for Philippeville, Mariembourg, Dinant, Bouillon. In Flanders, the Dutch troops capitulated at the same time in Bruges, Ypres, Ostend, Menen, Oudenaarde, Geeraardsbergen (pp. 113–114), but nor in Ghent nor in Antwerp (only liberated on 17 October and 27 October).
Against these interpretation, in any case for the troubles in Brussels, John W. Rooney Jr wrote: It is clear from the quantitative analysis that an overwhelming majority of revolutionaries were domiciled in Brussels or in the nearby suburbs and that the aid came from outside was minimal. For example, for the day of 23 September, 88% of dead and wounded lived in Brussels identified and if we add those residing in Brabant, it reached 95%. It is true that if you look at the birthplace of revolutionary given by the census, the number of Brussels falls to less than 60%, which could suggest that there was support &quot;national&quot; (to different provinces Belgian), or outside the city, more than 40%.But it is nothing, we know that between 1800 and 1830 the population of the capital grew by 75,000 to 103,000, this growth is due to the designation in 1815 in Brussels as a second capital of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the rural exodus that accompanied the Industrial Revolution. It is therefore normal that a large part of the population of Brussels be originating provinces. These migrants came mainly from Flanders, which was hit hard by the crisis in the textile 1826-1830. This interpretation is also nationalist against the statements of witnesses: Charles Rogier said that there were neither in 1830 nor nation Belgian national sentiment within the population. The revolutionary Jean-Baptiste Nothomb ensures that &quot;the feeling of national unity is born today.&quot; As for Joseph Lebeau, he said that &quot;patriotism Belgian is the son of the revolution of 1830..&quot; Only in the following years as bourgeois revolutionary will &quot;legitimize ideological state power.

====In the Belgian State====

A few years after the Belgian revolution in 1830, the historian Louis Dewez underlined that &quot;Belgium is shared into two people, Walloons and Flemings. The former are speaking French, the latter are speaking Flemish. The border is clear (...) The provinces which are back the Walloon line, i.e.: the Province of Liège, the Brabant wallon, the Province of Namur, the Province of Hainaut are Walloon [...] And the other provinces throughout the line [...] are Flemish. It is not an arbitrarian division or an imagined combination in order to support an opinion or create a system: it is a fact...&quot; Jules Michelet traveled in Wallonia in 1840 and mentions many times in his &quot;History of France&quot; his interest for Wallonia and the Walloons (this page on the Culture of Wallonia), 476 (1851 edition published online)

====Relationship with the German-speaking community====

The Walloon Region institutionally comprises also the German-speaking community of Belgium around Eupen, in the east of the region, next to Germany which ceded the area to Belgium after the First World War. Many of the 60,000 or so inhabitants of this very small community reject being considered as Walloon and – with their community executive leader Karl-Heinz Lambertz want to remain a federating unit, and to have all the powers of the Belgian Regions and Communities. Even if they do not want them absolutely and immediately (10 July 2008, official speech for the Flanders&#x27; national holiday).

===Walloon diaspora===
*Département des Ardennes
*Quebec and other parts of Canada
*United Kingdom
*South Africa
*Wisconsin: it is estimated that between 5,000 and 7,500 Brabantines and Hesbignons answered the call of the New World from 1852 to 1856. Algoma, Brussels, Casco, Forestville, Green Bay, Kewaunee, Luxemburg, Namur, Sturgeon Bay (Françoise L&#x27;Empereur found 700 Walloon family names in the phone books of these towns). The Walloon population of the Door Peninsula have historically spoken a distinctive dialect of Walloon known as Wisconsin Walloon or &quot;Belgian&quot;.
*Sweden
*Italy

====Walloons in Germany====
Since the 11th century, the great towns along the river Meuse, for example, Dinant, Huy, and Liège, traded with Germany, where &quot;Wallengassen&quot; (Walloons&#x27; neighborhoods) were founded in certain cities. In Cologne, the Walloons were the most important foreign community, as noted by three roads named &quot;Walloonstreet&quot; in the city. The Walloons traded for materials they lacked, such as copper, found in Germany, especially at Goslar.

====Walloons in Poland====
Walloons were one of the first foreign immigrant groups in Poland, with Walloons settling in Wrocław probably since the 12th century, however, the first written mention of Walloon immigrants in Wrocław comes from . In the 12th century, Walloon brothers Aleksander and Walter from Malonne served as Catholic bishops of Płock and Wrocław in Poland, respectively, and there is a possibility that it was Bishop Walter who brought the first Walloon settlers to Poland. In the early 13th century Duke Henry the Bearded invited further Walloon immigrants to the area of Oława and Wierzbno to the south of Wrocław, and some descendants of Walloons from Wrocław also moved to Oława, Wierzbno, and Kraków. The guild of Walloon clothiers in Wrocław ceased to exist after 1422.

====Walloons in Transylvania====
In the 13th century, the medieval German colonization of Transylvania, then part of the Kingdom of Hungary, now central and north-western Romania, also included numerous Walloons. Place names such as &quot;Wallendorf&quot; (Walloon Village) and family names such as &quot;Valendorfean&quot; (Wallon peasant) can be found among the Romanian citizens of Transylvania.

====Walloons in Sweden====

Starting from the 1620s, numerous Walloon miners and iron-workers, with their families, settled in Sweden to work in iron mining and refining. Walloon methods of iron production were incorporated into Swedish practice, to supplement the existing German techniques. Many Walloon workers settled around the mine at Dannemora producing Öregrund iron which represented 15 per cent of Sweden&#x27;s iron production at that time.

They were originally led by the entrepreneur Louis de Geer, who commissioned them to work in the iron mines of Uppland and Östergötland. The wave of migration continued substantially into the 18th century. Walloon ancestry is traceable through Walloon surnames. Some people of Walloon descent belong to the &quot;Sällskapet Vallonättlingar&quot; (Society of Walloon Descendants).

====Walloons in Finland====
During the 17th century Walloons from Sweden started arriving in Finland, during which Finland was part of Sweden. Some also came directly from Wallonia. Most of them settled along the coast in ironworks. Many of the ironworks in Finland were established by Walloons. Walloons largely used the same methods as in Sweden, although Walloon forging was not used, instead Walloon smiths used the German method. As in Sweden, the Walloon population in Finland eventually integrated to the wider society. Former Finnish prime minister Paavo Lipponen is of Walloon descent.

====Walloons in South Africa====
===Walloon culture===
The Manifesto for Walloon culture in 1983 was a major event of the History of Wallonia quoted in the important books about the region&#x27;s history.

<text>Emil Hans Willi Hennig (20 April 1913 – 5 November 1976) was a German biologist and zoologist who is considered the founder of phylogenetic systematics, otherwise known as cladistics. In 1945 as a prisoner of war, Hennig began work on his theory of cladistics, which he published in German in 1950, with a substantially revised English translation published in 1966. With his works on evolution and systematics he revolutionised the view of the natural order of beings. As a taxonomist, he specialised in dipterans (true flies).

Hennig coined the key terms synapomorphy, symplesiomorphy, and paraphyly. He also asserted, in his &quot;auxiliary principle&quot;, that &quot;the presence of apomorphous characters in different species &#x27;is always reason for suspecting kinship [i.e., that species belong to a monophyletic group], and that their origin by convergence should not be presumed a priori&#x27; (Hennig, 1953). This was based on the conviction that &#x27;phylogenetic systematics would lose all ground on which it stands&#x27; if the presence of apomorphous characters in different species were considered first of all as convergences (or parallelisms), with proof to the contrary required in each case.&quot; This has been viewed as an application of the parsimony principle to the interpretation of characters, an important component of phylogenetic inference.

He is also remembered for Hennig&#x27;s progression rule in cladistics, which argues controversially that the most primitive species are found in the earliest, central part of a group&#x27;s area.

==Biography==

===Early years and studies===
Hennig was born in Dürrhennersdorf, Upper Lusatia. His mother Marie Emma, née Groß, worked as a maid and, later, factory worker. His father Karl Ernst Emil Hennig was a rail worker. Willi had two brothers, Fritz Rudolf Hennig, who became a minister, and Karl Herbert, who went missing at the Battle of Stalingrad in 1943.

In the spring of 1919, Willi Hennig started school in Dürrhennersdorf, and subsequently was at school in Taubenheim an der Spree and Oppach. Rudolf Hennig described the family as calm; his father possessed an even temperament.

As of 1927, Willi Hennig continued his education at the Realgymnasium and boarding school in Klotzsche near Dresden. Here he met his first mentor M. Rost, a science teacher, whom he lived with in a house known as the &quot;Abteilung&quot;. Rost had an interest in insects and introduced Hennig to Wilhelm Meise, who worked as a scientist at the Dresdener Museum für Tierkunde (State Museum of Zoology, Dresden). In 1930, Hennig skipped a year, and graduated on 26 February 1932. As early as 1931, Willi Hennig composed an essay entitled &quot;Die Stellung der Systematik in der Zoologie&quot; (&quot;The state of systematics in zoology&quot;) as part of his school work, published posthumously in 1978. It showed his interest as well as his deliberate treatment of systematic problems. Besides school, Hennig worked as a volunteer at the museum and, in collaboration with Meise, saw to the systematic and biogeographical investigation of the &quot;flying&quot; snakes of the genus &quot;Dendrophis&quot; that became his first published work.

From the summer semester of 1932 onwards, Hennig read zoology, botany and geology at the University of Leipzig. He would continue to visit the Museum in Dresden. There, he met the curator of the entomological collection, the Dipteran expert Fritz Isidor van Emden. Hennig saw him regularly until van Emden was expelled from National Socialist Germany for having a Jewish mother and wife.

Hennig developed a deep friendship with Emden&#x27;s successor, Klaus Günther. Hennig concluded his studies with a dissertation entitled, &quot;&quot;. By this time, Hennig had published eight scientific papers. Besides his 300-page revision of the &quot;Tylidae&quot; (now classed as Micropezidae), there were further papers on Diptera and the agamid genus &quot;Draco&quot; of gliding lizards. After his studies, Hennig was Volontär at the State Museum for Zoology in Dresden. On 1 January 1937, he obtained a scholarship from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) to work at the German Entomological Institute of the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft in Berlin-Dahlem. On 13 May 1939, Hennig married his former fellow student Irma Wehnert. By 1945, they had three sons, Wolfgang (born 1941), Bernd (born 1943) and Gerd (born 1945).

===As a military entomologist===
Willi Hennig was drafted in 1938 to train for the infantry and concluded this course in 1939. As of the start of World War II, he was deployed in the infantry in Poland, France, Denmark and Russia. He was injured by grenade shrapnel in 1942 and was subsequently used as entomologist at the Institute for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in Berlin, carrying the rank of a Sonderführer (Z). Just before the war ended, he was sent to Italy to the 10th Army, Heeresgruppe C, to fight malaria and other epidemic diseases. At the end of the war in May 1945, he was captured by the British while he was with the Malaria training corps at the Gulf of Trieste, and was only released in the autumn.

Through his active participation in war as soldier and scientist Hennig was later subjected to accusations that he had been a member of the National Socialist party, especially by the Italian biologist and founder of panbiogeography, Leon Croizat. No evidence has been officially presented to support the claim. There is no report of Hennig supporting the National Socialist party views publicly on any occasion. Hennig did believe that Nazi Germany would win World War II.

During his time as prisoner of war, Hennig began to draft his most important contribution to systematics, not published until 1950. The rough draft was composed with pencil and ballpoint pen into an A4 exercise book, spanning 170 pages. During the war, he also published a further 25 scientific papers. Most of the correspondence and literature research was conducted by his wife, Irma.

===1950s: &quot;Basic outline of a theory of phylogenetic systematics&quot;===
From 1 December 1945, to 31 March 1947, Willi Hennig stood in for his thesis supervisor Paul Buchner as assistant to Professor Friedrich Hempelmann at the University of Leipzig, giving lectures in general biology, zoology and special zoology of insects. He returned to the German Entomological Institute in Berlin on 1 April 1947, and gave up his position in Leipzig. From 1 November 1949, he led the section for systematic entomology and was second director of the institute. On 1 August 1950, he habilitated in zoology at the Brandenburgische Landeshochschule in Potsdam. On 10 October that year he was offered a professorship with teaching responsibilities, which he fulfilled lecturing on special zoology of invertebrates, systematic zoology and taxonomic practicals. In the same year, he published his &quot;Basic outline of a theory of phylogenetic systematics&quot;, and further works on the methodology of phylogenetic systematics followed in the ensuing years, accompanied by numerous taxonomic works about Diptera. His two-volume &quot;Pocket book of zoology&quot;, in which he applied phylogenetic systematics to invertebrates for the first time, was particularly successful.

He continued working at the German Entomological Institute in the Soviet Sector of Berlin, Berlin-Friedrichshagen, all the while living in the American sector in Berlin-Steglitz. On a trip to France with his son on 13 August 1961, he heard of the impending Berlin Wall and returned to Berlin immediately to quit his appointment. Moving to East Berlin was out of the question, as Hennig held anti-communist views and already had a troubled relationship with the Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands (Socialist Unity Party of Germany, SED) that was the ruling political party of East Germany, as Hennig had repeatedly helped employees of the institute gain employment in the West.

===1961 to 1976===
In West Berlin, Hennig was given an interim post at the Technische Universität Berlin as Distinguished Professor. He rejected offers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C., and an offer made by his friend Elmo Hardy, to become a Research Fellow at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, citing as reasons that the education of his sons took priority for him, and that he needed to have the &quot;cultural witnesses of the antique Greek-Roman Europe within ready access&quot;. He instead decided on a post at the State Museum of Natural History in Stuttgart, where he was given a department for phylogenetic research. In April 1963, he moved to Ludwigsburg-Pflugfelden for this position. The scientific collections of the museum had been provisorily kept in Ludwigsburg and remained here until their re-housing at the new site of the museum at Stuttgart&#x27;s Löwentor, in 1985.

Hennig&#x27;s works in Stuttgart dealt almost exclusively with taxonomic revisions of Dipterans. For the &quot;Stuttgarter Beiträge zur Naturkunde&quot;, where he published the majority of his works, he completed 29 issues by the end of his life. Significant are the review articles published in Erwin Lindner&#x27;s &quot;Flies of the Palaearctic Regions&quot; and the &quot;Handbuch der Zoologie&quot;. The cladistic methodology was also represented in several published works, foremost among them the article, &quot;Cladistic analysis or cladistic classification? A reply to Ernst Mayr&quot; (1974), intended as an internationally accessible reply to the criticism Ernst Mayr had made of Hennig&#x27;s phylogenetic systematics.

Willi Hennig only visited international institutions abroad twice, in spite of receiving many invitations for guest lectures. From 1 September to 30 November 1967, he worked at the Entomology Research Institute at Canada&#x27;s Department of Agriculture in Ottawa and participated in the International Congress of Entomology in Canberra from 22 to 30 August 1972. With his wife, he also visited Bangkok, New Guinea (where much of Mayr&#x27;s understanding of bird taxonomy originated) and Singapore on this latter trip. His stay in Canada was also used for visits to various entomological collections in museums of the US, including Cambridge, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and New York, always in the hope of finding further amber inclusions of Dipterans, that featured prominently in his research of the late 1960s and early 1970s. On the initiative of Klaus Günther, who by then held a chair at the Freie Universität Berlin, Hennig was given an honorary doctorate on 4 December 1968; for health reasons, he could not accept this honour in person, and it was presented to him by Günther on 21 March 1969, in Stuttgart. On the initiative of students whom he had lectured on several animal taxa, Hennig was made an honorary professor at the University of Tübingen on 27 February 1970.

On the night of 5 November 1976, Hennig died of a heart attack at Ludwigsburg. He had previously repeatedly cancelled lectures with reference to his fading health, and had already had an attack on his journey to Ottawa. He was interred on 10 November at the Bergfriedhof in Tübingen.

The dipteran genus &quot;Hennigiola&quot; is named after him, as is the Evaniid wasp &quot;Hyptia hennigi&quot;.

== Legacy ==
The Willi Hennig Society, an organization devoted to the advancement of cladistic principles in systematic biology, was founded in 1981. The society publishes the journal &quot;Cladistics&quot;.
A symposium, &quot;Willi Hennig (1913-1976): His Life, Legacy and the Future of Phylogenetic Systematics&quot;, was held in London by the Linnean Society of London on 27 November 2013. A symposium volume was published in 2016 by the Systematics Association.

<doc id="33954" wikidata="Q160852" url="?curid=33954" title="William Ewart Gladstone">
<text>William Ewart Gladstone ( ; 29 December 1809 – 19 May 1898) was a British statesman, starting as Conservative MP for Newark and later becoming the leader of the Liberal Party.
In a career lasting over 60 years, he was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom for 12 years, spread over four non-consecutive terms (the most of any British prime minister) beginning in 1868 and ending in 1894. He also was Chancellor of the Exchequer four times, for over 12 years. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for 60 years, from 1832 to 1845 and from 1847 to 1895; during that time he represented a total of five constituencies.

Gladstone was born in Liverpool to Scottish parents. He first entered the House of Commons in 1832, beginning his political career as a High Tory, a grouping that became the Conservative Party under Robert Peel in 1834. Gladstone served as a minister in both of Peel&#x27;s governments, and in 1846 joined the breakaway Peelite faction, which eventually merged into the new Liberal Party in 1859. He was chancellor under Lord Aberdeen (1852–1855), Lord Palmerston (1859–1865) and Lord Russell (1865–1866). Gladstone&#x27;s own political doctrine – which emphasised equality of opportunity and opposition to trade protectionism – came to be known as Gladstonian liberalism. His popularity amongst the working-class earned him the sobriquet &quot;The People&#x27;s William&quot;.

In 1868, Gladstone became prime minister for the first time. Many reforms were passed during his first ministry, including the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland and the introduction of secret voting. After electoral defeat in 1874, Gladstone resigned as leader of the Liberal Party. From 1876 he began a comeback based on opposition to the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s reaction to the Bulgarian April Uprising. His Midlothian Campaign of 1879–1880 was an early example of many modern political campaigning techniques. After the 1880 general election, Gladstone formed his second ministry (1880–1885), which saw the passage of the Third Reform Act as well as crises in Egypt (culminating in the Fall of Khartoum) and Ireland, where his government passed repressive measures but also improved the legal rights of Irish tenant farmers.

Back in office in early 1886, Gladstone proposed home rule for Ireland but was defeated in the House of Commons. The resulting split in the Liberal Party helped keep them out of office – with one short break – for 20 years. Gladstone formed his last government in 1892, at the age of 82. The Government of Ireland Bill 1893 passed through the Commons but was defeated in the House of Lords in 1893, after which Irish Home Rule became a lesser part of his party&#x27;s agenda. Gladstone left office in March 1894, aged 84, as both the oldest person to serve as prime minister and the only prime minister to have served four non-consecutive terms. He left Parliament in 1895 and died three years later.

Gladstone was known affectionately by his supporters as &quot;The People&#x27;s William&quot; or the &quot;G.O.M.&quot; (&quot;Grand Old Man&quot;, or, to political rivals &quot;God&#x27;s Only Mistake&quot;). Historians often rank Gladstone as one of the greatest prime ministers in British history.

==Early life==

Born on 29 December 1809 in Liverpool, at 62 Rodney Street, William Ewart Gladstone was the fourth son of the wealthy merchant, planter and Tory politician John Gladstone, and his second wife, Anne MacKenzie Robertson. He was named after a close friend of his father, William Ewart, another Liverpool merchant and the father of William Ewart, later a Liberal politician. In 1835, the family name was changed from Gladstones to Gladstone by royal licence. His father was made a baronet, of Fasque and Balfour, in 1846.

Although born and raised in Liverpool, William Gladstone was of purely Scottish ancestry. His grandfather Thomas Gladstones was a prominent merchant from Leith, and his maternal grandfather, Andrew Robertson, was Provost of Dingwall and a Sheriff-Substitute of Ross-shire. His biographer John Morley described him as &quot;a highlander in the custody of a lowlander&quot;, and an adversary as &quot;an ardent Italian in the custody of a Scotsman&quot;. One of his earliest childhood memories was being made to stand on a table and say &quot;Ladies and gentlemen&quot; to the assembled audience, probably at a gathering to promote the election of George Canning as MP for Liverpool in 1812. In 1814, young &quot;Willy&quot; visited Scotland for the first time, as he and his brother John travelled with their father to Edinburgh, Biggar and Dingwall to visit their relatives. Willy and his brother were both made freemen of the burgh of Dingwall. In 1815, Gladstone also travelled to London and Cambridge for the first time with his parents. Whilst in London, he attended a service of thanksgiving with his family at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral following the Battle of Waterloo, where he saw the Prince Regent.

William Gladstone was educated from 1816 to 1821 at a preparatory school at the vicarage of St. Thomas&#x27; Church at Seaforth, close to his family&#x27;s residence, Seaforth House. In 1821, William followed in the footsteps of his elder brothers and attended Eton College before matriculating in 1828 at Christ Church, Oxford, where he read Classics and Mathematics, although he had no great interest in the latter subject. In December 1831, he achieved the double first-class degree he had long desired. Gladstone served as President of the Oxford Union, where he developed a reputation as an orator, which followed him into the House of Commons. At university, Gladstone was a Tory and denounced Whig proposals for parliamentary reform in a famous debate at the Oxford Union in May 1831. On the second day of the three-day debate on the Whig Reform Bill Gladstone moved the motion: 
That the Ministry has unwisely introduced, and most unscrupulously forwarded, a measure which threatens not only to change the form of our Government, but ultimately to break up the very foundations of social order, as well as materially to forward the views of those who are pursuing the project throughout the civilised world.
Gladstone&#x27;s 45-minute speech made a great impression on those present and his Amendment carried 94 votes to 38. Among those impressed was Lord Lincoln, who told his father the Duke of Newcastle about it, and it was through this recommendation that the Duke offered Gladstone the safe seat of Newark which he then controlled. 

Following the success of his double first, William travelled with his brother John on a Grand Tour of western Europe.

Although Gladstone entered Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1833, with intentions of becoming a barrister, by 1839 he had requested that his name should be removed from the list because he no longer intended to be called to the Bar.

In September 1842 he lost the forefinger of his left hand in an accident while reloading a gun. Thereafter he wore a glove or finger sheath (stall).

==House of Commons==
===First term===
When Gladstone was 22 the Duke of Newcastle, a Conservative party activist, provided him with one of two seats at Newark where he controlled about a fourth of the very small electorate. The Duke spent thousands of pounds entertaining the voters. Gladstone displayed remarkably strong technique as a campaigner and stump speaker. He won his seat at the 1832 United Kingdom general election with 887 votes. After new bills to protect child workers were proposed following the publication of the Sadler report, he voted against the 1833 Factory Acts that would regulate the hours of work and welfare of minors employed in cotton mills.

===Opposition to the opium trade===

Gladstone was an intense opponent of the opium trade. Referring to the opium trade between British India and Qing China, Gladstone described it as &quot;infamous and atrocious&quot;. Gladstone emerged as a fierce critic of the Opium Wars, which Britain waged to re-legalise the British opium trade into China, which had been made illegal by the Chinese government. He publicly lambasted the wars as &quot;Palmerston&#x27;s Opium War&quot; and said that he felt &quot;in dread of the judgements of God upon England for our national iniquity towards China&quot; in May 1840. A famous speech was made by Gladstone in Parliament against the First Opium War. Gladstone criticised it as &quot;a war more unjust in its origin, a war more calculated in its progress to cover this country with permanent disgrace&quot;. His hostility to opium stemmed from the effects of opium upon his sister Helen. Before 1841, Gladstone was reluctant to join the Peel government because of the First Opium War, which Palmerston had brought on.

==Minister under Peel (1841–1846)==
Gladstone was re-elected in 1841. In the second ministry of Robert Peel, he served as President of the Board of Trade (1843–1845).

Gladstone was responsible for the Railway Regulation Act 1844 (7 &amp; 8 Vict. c. 85), regarded by historians as the birth of the regulatory state, of network industry regulation, of rate of return regulation, and telegraph regulation. Examples of its foresight are the clauses empowering the government to take control of railways in times of war, the concept of Parliamentary trains, limited in cost to a penny a mile, of universal service, and of control of the recently invented electric telegraph which ran alongside railway lines. Railways were the largest investment (as a percentage of GNP) in human history and this bill the most heavily lobbied in parliamentary history. Gladstone succeeded in guiding the Act through Parliament at the height of the railway bubble.

Gladstone became concerned with the situation of &quot;coal whippers&quot;. These were the men who worked on London docks, &quot;whipping&quot; in baskets from ships to barges or wharves all incoming coal from the sea. They were called up and relieved through public houses, so a man could not get this job unless he had the favourable opinion of the publican, who looked most favourably upon those who drank. The man&#x27;s name was written down and the &quot;score&quot; followed. Publicans issued employment solely on the capacity of the man to pay, and men were often drunk when they left the pub to work. They spent their savings on drinks to secure the favourable opinion of publicans and further employment.

Gladstone initiated the Coal Vendors Act 1843 (6 &amp; 7 Vict. c. 2), which set up a central office for employment. When that act expired in 1856, a select committee was appointed by the Lords in 1857 to look into the question. Gladstone gave evidence to the committee, stating:

Looking back in 1883, Gladstone wrote that &quot;In principle, perhaps my Coalwhippers Act of 1843 was the most Socialistic measure of the last half century&quot;.

He resigned in 1845 over the Maynooth Grant issue, which was a matter of conscience for him. To improve relations with the Catholic Church, Peel&#x27;s government proposed increasing the annual grant paid to the Maynooth Seminary for training Catholic priests in Ireland. Gladstone, who had previously argued in a book that a Protestant country should not pay money to other churches, nevertheless supported the increase in the Maynooth grant and voted for it in Commons, but resigned rather than face charges that he had compromised his principles to remain in office. After accepting Gladstone&#x27;s resignation, Peel confessed to a friend, &quot;I really have great difficulty sometimes in exactly comprehending what he means&quot;. In December 1845, Gladstone returned to Peel&#x27;s government as Colonial Secretary. The &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; notes: &quot;As such, he had to stand for re-election, but the strong protectionism of the Duke of Newcastle, his patron in Newark, meant that he could not stand there and no other seat was available. Throughout the corn law crisis of 1846, therefore, Gladstone was in the highly anomalous and possibly unique position of being a secretary of state without a seat in either house and thus unanswerable to parliament.&quot;

==Return to the backbenches (1846–1851)==
When Peel&#x27;s government fell in 1846, Gladstone and other Peel loyalists followed their leader in separating from the protectionist Conservatives; instead offering tentative support to the new Whig prime minister Lord John Russell, with whom Peel had cooperated over the repeal of the Corn Laws. After Peel&#x27;s death in 1850, Gladstone emerged as the leader of the Peelites in the House of Commons. He was re-elected for the University of Oxford (i.e. representing the MA graduates of the university) at the General Election in 1847 – Peel had once held this seat but had lost it because of his espousal of Catholic Emancipation in 1829. Gladstone became a constant critic of Lord Palmerston.

In 1847 Gladstone helped to establish Glenalmond College, then The Holy and Undivided Trinity College at Glenalmond. The school was set up as an episcopal foundation to spread the ideas of Anglicanism in Scotland, and to educate the sons of the gentry.

As a young man Gladstone had treated his father&#x27;s estate, Fasque, in Kincardineshire, southwest of Aberdeen, as home, but as a younger son he would not inherit it. Instead, from the time of his marriage, he lived at his wife&#x27;s family&#x27;s estate at Hawarden in Flintshire, Wales. He never actually owned Hawarden, which belonged first to his brother-in-law Sir Stephen Glynne, and was then inherited by Gladstone&#x27;s eldest son in 1874. During the late 1840s, when he was out of office, he worked extensively to turn Hawarden into a viable business.

In 1848 he founded the Church Penitentiary Association for the Reclamation of Fallen Women. In May 1849 he began his most active &quot;rescue work&quot; and met prostitutes late at night on the street, in his house or in their houses, writing their names in a private notebook. He aided the House of Mercy at Clewer near Windsor (which exercised extreme in-house discipline) and spent much time arranging employment for ex-prostitutes. In a &quot;Declaration&quot; signed on 7 December 1896 and only to be opened after his death, Gladstone wrote, &quot;I desire to record my solemn declaration and assurance, as in the sight of God and before His Judgement Seat, that at no period of my life have I been guilty of the act which is known as that of infidelity to the marriage bed.&quot;

In 1850–51 Gladstone visited Naples, Italy, for the benefit of his daughter Mary&#x27;s eyesight. Giacomo Lacaita, a legal adviser to the British embassy, was at the time imprisoned by the Neapolitan government, as were other political dissidents. Gladstone became concerned about the political situation in Naples and the arrest and imprisonment of Neapolitan liberals. In February 1851 Gladstone visited the prisons where thousands of them were held and was extremely outraged. In April and July, he published two &quot;Letters to the Earl of Aberdeen&quot; against the Neapolitan government and responded to his critics in &quot;An Examination of the Official Reply of the Neapolitan Government&quot; in 1852. Gladstone&#x27;s first letter described what he saw in Naples as &quot;the negation of God erected into a system of government&quot;.

==Chancellor of the Exchequer (1852–1855)==

In 1852, following the appointment of Lord Aberdeen as prime minister, head of a coalition of Whigs and Peelites, Gladstone became Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Whig Sir Charles Wood and the Tory Disraeli had both been perceived to have failed in the office and so this provided Gladstone with a great political opportunity.

His first budget in 1853 almost completed the work begun by Peel eleven years before in simplifying Britain&#x27;s tariff of duties and customs. 123 duties were abolished and 133 duties were reduced. The income tax had legally expired but Gladstone proposed to extend it for seven years to fund tariff reductions:

We propose, then, to re-enact it for two years, from April 1853 to April 1855, at the rate of 7d. in the £; from April 1855, to enact it for two more years at 6d. in the £; and then for three years more ... from April 1857, at 5d. Under this proposal, on 5 April 1860, the income tax will by law expire.

Gladstone wanted to maintain a balance between direct and indirect taxation and to abolish income tax. He knew that its abolition depended on a considerable retrenchment in government expenditure. He therefore increased the number of people eligible to pay it by lowering the threshold from £150 to £100. The more people that paid income tax, Gladstone believed, the more the public would pressure the government into abolishing it. Gladstone argued that the £100 line was &quot;the dividing line ... between the educated and the labouring part of the community&quot; and that therefore the income taxpayers and the electorate were to be the same people, who would then vote to cut government expenditure.

The budget speech (delivered on 18 April), nearly five hours long, raised Gladstone &quot;at once to the front rank of financiers as of orators&quot;. Colin Matthew has written that Gladstone &quot;made finance and figures exciting, and succeeded in constructing budget speeches epic in form and performance, often with lyrical interludes to vary the tension in the Commons as the careful exposition of figures and argument was brought to a climax&quot;. The contemporary diarist Charles Greville wrote of Gladstone&#x27;s speech:

... by universal consent it was one of the grandest displays and most able financial statement that ever was heard in the House of Commons; a great scheme, boldly, skilfully, and honestly devised, disdaining popular clamour and pressure from without, and the execution of it absolute perfection. Even those who do not admire the Budget, or who are injured by it, admit the merit of the performance. It has raised Gladstone to a great political elevation, and, what is of far greater consequence than the measure itself, has given the country assurance of a man equal to great political necessities, and fit to lead parties and direct governments.

During wartime, he insisted on raising taxes and not borrowing funds to pay for the war. The goal was to turn wealthy Britons against expensive wars. Britain entered the Crimean War in February 1854, and Gladstone introduced his budget on 6 March. He had to increase expenditure on the military and a vote of credit of £1,250,000 was taken to send a force of 25,000 to the front. The deficit for the year would be £2,840,000 (estimated revenue £56,680,000; estimated expenditure £59,420,000). Gladstone refused to borrow the money needed to rectify this deficit and instead increased income tax by half, from sevenpence to tenpence-halfpenny in the pound (from 2.92% to 4.38%). By May another £6,870,000 was needed for the war and Gladstone raised the income tax from tenpence halfpenny to fourteen pence in the pound to raise £3,250,000. Spirits, malt, and sugar were taxed to raise the rest of the money needed. He proclaimed:
:The expenses of a war are the moral check which it has pleased the Almighty to impose upon the ambition and lust of conquest that are inherent in so many nations ... The necessity of meeting from year to year the expenditure which it entails is a salutary and wholesome check, making them feel what they are about, and making them measure the cost of the benefit upon which they may calculate.

He served until 1855, a few weeks into Lord Palmerston&#x27;s first premiership, and resigned along with the rest of the Peelites after a motion was passed to appoint a committee of inquiry into the conduct of the war.

==Opposition (1855–1859)==

The Conservative Leader Lord Derby became Prime Minister in 1858, but Gladstone – who like the other Peelites was still nominally a Conservative – declined a position in his government, opting not to sacrifice his free-trade principles.

Between November 1858 and February 1859, Gladstone, on behalf of Lord Derby&#x27;s government, was made Extraordinary Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands embarking via Vienna and Trieste on a twelve-week mission to the southern Adriatic entrusted with complex challenges that had arisen in connection with the future of the British protectorate of the United States of the Ionian Islands.

In 1858, Gladstone took up the hobby of tree felling, mostly of oak trees, an exercise he continued with enthusiasm until he was 81 in 1891. Eventually, he became notorious for this activity, prompting Lord Randolph Churchill to observe: For the purposes of recreation he has selected the felling of trees; and we may usefully remark that his amusements, like his politics, are essentially destructive. Every afternoon the whole world is invited to assist at the crashing fall of some beech or elm or oak. The forest laments in order that Mr Gladstone may perspire.&quot; Less noticed at the time was his practice of replacing the trees felled by planting new saplings.

Gladstone was a lifelong bibliophile. In his lifetime, he read around 20,000 books, and eventually owned a library of over 32,000.

==Chancellor of the Exchequer (1859–1866)==

In 1859, Lord Palmerston formed a new mixed government with Radicals included, and Gladstone again joined the government (with most of the other remaining Peelites) as Chancellor of the Exchequer, to become part of the new Liberal Party.

Gladstone inherited a deficit of nearly £5,000,000, with income tax now set at 5d (fivepence). Like Peel, Gladstone dismissed the idea of borrowing to cover the deficit. Gladstone argued that &quot;In time of peace nothing but dire necessity should induce us to borrow&quot;. Most of the money needed was acquired through raising the income tax to 9d. Usually, not more than two-thirds of a tax imposed could be collected in a financial year so Gladstone therefore imposed the extra four pence at a rate of 8d. during the first half of the year so that he could obtain the additional revenue in one year. Gladstone&#x27;s dividing line set up in 1853 had been abolished in 1858 but Gladstone revived it, with lower incomes to pay 6½d. instead of 9d. For the first half of the year, the lower incomes paid 8d. and the higher incomes paid 13d. in income tax.

On 12 September 1859 the Radical MP Richard Cobden visited Gladstone, who recorded it in his diary: &quot;... further conv. with Mr. Cobden on Tariffs &amp; relations with France. We are closely &amp; warmly agreed&quot;. Cobden was sent as Britain&#x27;s representative to the negotiations with France&#x27;s Michel Chevalier for a free trade treaty between the two countries. Gladstone wrote to Cobden: 
... the great aim – the moral and political significance of the act, and its probable and desired fruit in binding the two countries together by interest and affection. Neither you nor I attach for the moment any superlative value to this Treaty for the sake of the extension of British trade. ... What I look to is the social good, the benefit to the relations of the two countries, and the effect on the peace of Europe.

Gladstone&#x27;s budget of 1860 was introduced on 10 February along with the Cobden–Chevalier Treaty between Britain and France that would reduce tariffs between the two countries. This budget &quot;marked the final adoption of the Free Trade principle, that taxation should be levied for Revenue purposes alone, and that every protective, differential, or discriminating duty ... should be dislodged&quot;. At the beginning of 1859, there were 419 duties in existence. The 1860 budget reduced the number of duties to 48, with 15 duties constituting the majority of the revenue. To finance these reductions in indirect taxation, the income tax, instead of being abolished, was raised to 10d. for incomes above £150 and at 7d. for incomes above £100.

In 1860 Gladstone intended to abolish the duty on paper – a controversial policy – because the duty traditionally inflated the cost of publishing and hindered the dissemination of radical working-class ideas. Although Palmerston supported the continuation of the duty, using it and income tax revenue to buy arms, a majority of his Cabinet supported Gladstone. The Bill to abolish duties on paper narrowly passed the Commons but was rejected by the House of Lords. No money bill had been rejected by the Lords for over 200 years, and a furore arose over this vote. The next year, Gladstone included the abolition of paper duty in a consolidated Finance Bill (the first ever) to force the Lords to accept it and accept it they did. The proposal in the Commons of one bill only per session for the national finances was a precedent uniformly followed from that date until 1910, and it has been ever since the rule.

Gladstone steadily reduced Income tax over the course of his tenure as Chancellor. In 1861 the tax was reduced to ninepence (£0–0s–9d), in 1863 to sevenpence, in 1864 to fivepence and in 1865 to fourpence. Gladstone believed that government was extravagant and wasteful with taxpayers&#x27; money and so sought to let money &quot;fructify in the pockets of the people&quot; by keeping taxation levels down through &quot;peace and retrenchment&quot;. In 1859 he wrote to his brother, who was a member of the Financial Reform Association at Liverpool: &quot;Economy is the first and great article (economy such as I understand it) in my financial creed. The controversy between direct and indirect taxation holds a minor, though important place&quot;. He wrote to his wife on 14 January 1860: &quot;I am &quot;certain&quot;, from experience, of the immense advantage of strict account-keeping in early life. It is just like learning the grammar then, which when once learned need not be referred to afterwards&quot;.
Because of his actions as Chancellor, Gladstone earned the reputation as the liberator of British trade and the working man&#x27;s breakfast table, the man responsible for the emancipation of the popular press from &quot;taxes upon knowledge&quot; and for placing a duty on the succession of the estates of the rich. Gladstone&#x27;s popularity rested on his taxation policies which meant to his supporters balance, social equity and political justice. The most significant expression of working-class opinion was at Northumberland in 1862 when Gladstone visited. George Holyoake recalled in 1865:
When Mr Gladstone visited the North, you well remember when word passed from the newspaper to the workman that it circulated through mines and mills, factories and workshops, and they came out to greet the only British minister who ever gave the English people a right because it was just they should have it ... and when he went down the Tyne, all the country heard how twenty miles of banks were lined with people who came to greet him. Men stood in the blaze of chimneys; the roofs of factories were crowded; colliers came up from the mines; women held up their children on the banks that it might be said in after life that they had seen the Chancellor of the People go by. The river was covered like the land. Every man who could ply an oar pulled up to give Mr Gladstone a cheer. When Lord Palmerston went to Bradford the streets were still, and working men imposed silence upon themselves. When Mr Gladstone appeared on the Tyne he heard cheer no other English minister ever heard ... the people were grateful to him, and rough pitmen who never approached a public man before, pressed round his carriage by thousands ... and thousands of arms were stretched out at once, to shake hands with Mr Gladstone as one of themselves.

When Gladstone first joined Palmerston&#x27;s government in 1859, he had opposed further electoral reform, but he changed his position during Palmerston&#x27;s last premiership, and by 1865 he was firmly in favour of enfranchising the working classes in towns. The policy caused friction with Palmerston, who strongly opposed enfranchisement. At the beginning of each session, Gladstone would passionately urge the Cabinet to adopt new policies, while Palmerston would fixedly stare at a paper before him. At a lull in Gladstone&#x27;s speech, Palmerston would smile, rap the table with his knuckles, and interject pointedly, &quot;Now, my Lords and gentlemen, let us go to business&quot;. Although he personally was not a Nonconformist, and rather disliked them in person, he formed a coalition with the Nonconformists that gave the Liberals a powerful base of support.

===American Civil War===
Palmerston&#x27;s government adopted a position of British neutrality throughout the war while declining to recognise the independence of the Confederacy. In October 1862 Gladstone made a speech in Newcastle in which he said that Jefferson Davis and the other Confederate leaders had &quot;made a nation&quot;, and that the Confederacy seemed certain to succeed in asserting its independence from the North, and that the time might come when it would be the duty of the European powers to &quot;offer friendly aid in compromising the quarrel.&quot; The speech caused consternation on both sides of the Atlantic and led to speculation that Britain might be about to recognise the Confederacy. Gladstone was accused of sympathising with the South, a charge he rejected. Gladstone was forced to clarify in the press that his comments in Newcastle had not been intended to signal a change in Government policy, but to express his belief that the North&#x27;s efforts to defeat the South would fail, due to the strength of Southern resistance.

===Electoral reform===
In May 1864 Gladstone said that he saw no reason in principle why all mentally able men could not be enfranchised, but admitted that this would only come about once the working classes themselves showed more interest in the subject. Queen Victoria was not pleased with this statement, and an outraged Palmerston considered it a seditious incitement to agitation.

Gladstone&#x27;s support for electoral reform and disestablishment of the (Anglican) Church of Ireland won support from Nonconformists but alienated him from constituents in his Oxford University seat, and he lost it in the 1865 general election. A month later he stood as a candidate in South Lancashire, where he was elected third MP (South Lancashire at this time elected three MPs). Palmerston campaigned for Gladstone in Oxford because he believed that his constituents would keep him &quot;partially muzzled&quot;; many Oxford graduates were Anglican clergymen at that time. A victorious Gladstone told his new constituency, &quot;At last, my friends, I am come among you; and I am come – to use an expression which has become very famous and is not likely to be forgotten – I am come &#x27;unmuzzled&#x27;.&quot;

On Palmerston&#x27;s death in October, Earl Russell formed his second ministry. Russell and Gladstone (now the senior Liberal in the House of Commons) attempted to pass a reform bill, which was defeated in the Commons because the &quot;Adullamite&quot; Whigs, led by Robert Lowe, refused to support it. The Conservatives then formed a ministry, in which after a long Parliamentary debate Disraeli passed the Second Reform Act of 1867; Gladstone&#x27;s proposed bill had been totally outmanoeuvred; he stormed into the Chamber, but too late to see his arch-enemy pass the bill. Gladstone was furious; his animus commenced a long rivalry that would only end on Disraeli&#x27;s death and Gladstone&#x27;s encomium in the Commons in 1881.

===Leader of the Liberal Party, from 1867===
Lord Russell retired in 1867 and Gladstone became leader of the Liberal Party. In 1868 the Irish Church Resolutions were proposed as a measure to reunite the Liberal Party in government (on the issue of disestablishment of the Church of Ireland – this would be done during Gladstone&#x27;s First Government in 1869 and meant that Irish Roman Catholics did not need to pay their tithes to the Anglican Church of Ireland). When it was passed, Disraeli took the hint and called a General Election.

==First premiership (1868–1874)==
In the next general election in 1868, the South Lancashire constituency had been broken up by the Second Reform Act into two: South East Lancashire and South West Lancashire. Gladstone stood for South West Lancashire and for Greenwich, it being quite common then for candidates to stand in two constituencies simultaneously. To his great surprise he was defeated in South West Lancashire but, by winning in Greenwich, was able to remain in Parliament. He became prime minister for the first time and remained in office until 1874. Evelyn Ashley recorded that he had been felling a tree at Hawarden when brought the news that he was about to be appointed prime minister. He broke off briefly to declare &quot;My mission is to pacify Ireland&quot; before resuming his exertions.

In the 1860s and 1870s, Gladstonian Liberalism was characterised by a number of policies intended to improve individual liberty and loosen political and economic restraints. First was the minimisation of public expenditure on the premise that the economy and society were best helped by allowing people to spend as they saw fit. Secondly, his foreign policy aimed at promoting peace to help reduce expenditures and taxation and enhance trade. Thirdly, laws that prevented people from acting freely to improve themselves were reformed. When an unemployed miner (Daniel Jones) wrote to him to complain of his unemployment and low wages, Gladstone gave what H. C. G. Matthew has called &quot;the classic mid-Victorian reply&quot; on 20 October 1869:

The only means which have been placed in my power of &#x27;raising the wages of colliers&#x27; has been by endeavouring to beat down all those restrictions upon trade which tend to reduce the price to be obtained for the product of their labour, &amp; to lower as much as may be the taxes on the commodities which they may require for use or for consumption. Beyond this I look to the forethought not yet so widely diffused in this country as in Scotland, &amp; in some foreign lands; &amp; I need not remind you that in order to facilitate its exercise the Government have been empowered by Legislation to become through the Dept. of the P.O. the receivers &amp; guardians of savings.

Gladstone&#x27;s first premiership instituted reforms in the British Army, civil service, and local government to cut restrictions on individual advancement. The Local Government Board Act 1871 put the supervision of the Poor Law under the Local Government Board (headed by G. J. Goschen) and Gladstone&#x27;s &quot;administration could claim spectacular success in enforcing a dramatic reduction in supposedly sentimental and unsystematic outdoor poor relief, and in making, in co-operation with the Charity Organization Society (1869), the most sustained attempt of the century to impose upon the working classes the Victorian values of providence, self-reliance, foresight, and self-discipline&quot;. Gladstone was associated with the Charity Organization Society&#x27;s first annual report in 1870. Some leading Conservatives at this time were contemplating an alliance between the aristocracy and the working class against the capitalist class, an idea called the New Social Alliance. At a speech at Blackheath on 28 October 1871, he warned his constituents against these social reformers:

... they are not your friends, but they are your enemies in fact, though not in intention, who teach you to look to the Legislature for the radical removal of the evils that afflict human life. ... It is the individual mind and conscience, it is the individual character, on which mainly human happiness or misery depends. (Cheers.) The social problems that confront us are many and formidable. Let the Government labour to its utmost, let the Legislature labour days and nights in your service; but, after the very best has been attained and achieved, the question whether the English father is to be the father of a happy family and the centre of a united home is a question which must depend mainly upon himself. (Cheers.) And those who ... promise to the dwellers in towns that every one of them shall have a house and garden in free air, with ample space; those who tell you that there shall be markets for selling at wholesale prices retail quantities – I won&#x27;t say are impostors, because I have no doubt they are sincere; but I will say they are quacks (cheers); they are deluded and beguiled by a spurious philanthropy, and when they ought to give you substantial, even if they are humble and modest boons, they are endeavouring, perhaps without their own consciousness, to delude you with fanaticism, and offering to you a fruit which, when you attempt to taste it, will prove to be but ashes in your mouths. (Cheers.)

Gladstone instituted the abolition of the sale of commissions in the army: he also instituted the Cardwell Reforms in 1869 that made peacetime flogging illegal. In 1870, his government passed the Irish Land Act and Forster&#x27;s Education Act. In 1871 his government passed the Trade Union Act allowing trade unions to organise and operate legally for the first time (although picketing remained illegal). Gladstone later counted this reform as one of the most significant of the previous half-century, saying that before its passage the law had effectively &quot;compelled the British workman to work...in chains.&quot; In 1871, he instituted the Universities Tests Act. He secured passage of the Ballot Act for secret ballots, and the Licensing Act 1872. In foreign affairs, his over-riding aim was to promote peace and understanding, characterised by his settlement of the &quot;Alabama&quot; Claims in 1872 in favour of the Americans. During this time, his government gave the approval to launch the expedition of HMS &quot;Challenger&quot; at a time when public interest had turned away from scientific explorations. His leadership also led to the passage of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 restructuring the courts to create the modern High Court and Court of Appeal.

Gladstone unexpectedly dissolved Parliament in January 1874 and called a general election.

Gladstone&#x27;s proposals went some way to meet working-class demands, such as the realisation of the free breakfast table through repealing duties on tea and sugar, and reform of local taxation which was increasing for the poorer ratepayers. According to the working-class financial reformer Thomas Briggs, writing in the trade unionist newspaper &quot;The Bee-Hive&quot;, the manifesto relied on &quot;a much higher authority than Mr. Gladstone...viz., the late Richard Cobden&quot;. The dissolution itself was reported in &quot;The Times&quot; on 24 January. On 30 January, the names of the first fourteen MPs for uncontested seats were published. By 9 February a Conservative victory was apparent. In contrast to 1868 and 1880 when the Liberal campaign lasted several months, only three weeks separated the news of the dissolution and the election. The working-class newspapers were so taken by surprise they had little time to express an opinion on Gladstone&#x27;s manifesto before the election was over. Unlike the efforts of the Conservatives, the organisation of the Liberal Party had declined since 1868 and they had also failed to retain Liberal voters on the electoral register. George Howell wrote to Gladstone on 12 February: &quot;There is one lesson to be learned from this Election, that is Organization. ... We have lost not by a change of sentiment so much as by want of organised power&quot;. The Liberals received a majority of the vote in each of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom and 189,000 more votes nationally than the Conservatives. However, they obtained a minority of seats in the House of Commons.

==Opposition (1874–1880)==

In the wake of Benjamin Disraeli&#x27;s victory, Gladstone retired from the leadership of the Liberal party, although he retained his seat in the House.

===Anti-Catholicism===

Gladstone had a complex ambivalence about Catholicism. He was attracted by its international success in majestic traditions. More important, he was strongly opposed to the authoritarianism of its pope and bishops, its profound public opposition to liberalism, and its supposed refusal to distinguish between secular allegiance on the one hand and spiritual obedience on the other.

In November 1874, he published the pamphlet &quot;The Vatican Decrees in their Bearing on Civil Allegiance&quot;, directed at the First Vatican Council&#x27;s dogmatising Papal Infallibility in 1870, which had outraged him. Gladstone claimed that this decree had placed British Catholics in a dilemma over conflicts of loyalty to the Crown. He urged them to reject papal infallibility as they had opposed the Spanish Armada of 1588. The pamphlet sold 150,000 copies by the end of 1874. Cardinal Manning denied that the council had changed the relation of Catholics to their civil governments, and Archbishop James Roosevelt Bayley, in a letter which was obtained by the &quot;New York Herald&quot; and published without Bayley&#x27;s express permission, called Gladstone&#x27;s declaration &quot;a shameful calumny&quot; and attributed his &quot;monomania&quot; to the &quot;political hari-kari&quot; he had committed by dissolving Parliament, accusing him of &quot;putting on &#x27;the cap and bells&#x27; and attempting to play the part of Lord George Gordon&quot; in order to restore his political fortunes. John Henry Newman wrote the &quot;Letter to the Duke of Norfolk&quot; in reply to Gladstone&#x27;s charges that Catholics have &quot;no mental freedom&quot; and cannot be good citizens.

A second pamphlet followed in Feb 1875, a defence of the earlier pamphlet and a reply to his critics, entitled &quot;Vaticanism: an Answer to Reproofs and Replies&quot;. He described the Catholic Church as &quot;an Asian monarchy: nothing but one giddy height of despotism, and one dead level of religious subservience&quot;. He further claimed that the Pope wanted to destroy the rule of law and replace it with arbitrary tyranny, and then to hide these &quot;crimes against liberty beneath a suffocating cloud of incense&quot;.
===Opposition to socialism===

Gladstone was opposed to socialism after 1842 when he heard a socialist lecturer. Lord Kilbracken, one of Gladstone&#x27;s secretaries, commented:
The Liberal doctrines of that time, with their violent anti-socialist spirit and their strong insistence on the gospel of thrift, self-help, settlement of wages by the higgling of the market, and non-interference by the State... I think that Mr. Gladstone was the strongest anti-socialist that I have ever known...It is quite true, as has been often said, that &quot;we are all socialists up to a certain point&quot;; but Mr. Gladstone fixed that point lower, and was more vehement against those who went above it, than any other politician or official of my acquaintance. I remember his speaking indignantly to me of the budget of 1874 as &quot;That socialistic budget of Northcote&#x27;s,&quot; merely because of the special relief which it gave to the poorer class of income-tax payers. His strong belief in Free Trade was only one of the results of his deep-rooted conviction that the Government&#x27;s interference with the free action of the individual, whether by taxation or otherwise, should be kept at an irreducible minimum. It is, indeed, not too much to say that his conception of Liberalism was the negation of Socialism.

===Bulgarian Horrors===
A pamphlet Gladstone published on 6 September 1876, &quot;Bulgarian Horrors and the Question of the East&quot;, attacked the Disraeli government for its indifference to the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s violent repression of the Bulgarian April uprising. Gladstone made clear his hostility focused on the Turkish people, rather than on the Muslim religion. The Turks he said:


The historian Geoffrey Alderman has described Gladstone as &quot;unleashing the full fury of his oratorical powers against Jews and Jewish influence&quot; during the Bulgarian Crisis (1885–88), telling a journalist in 1876 that: &quot;I deeply deplore the manner in which, what I may call Judaic sympathies, beyond as well as within the circle of professed Judaism, are now acting on the question of the East&quot;. Gladstone similarly refused to speak out against the persecution of Romanian Jews in the 1870s and Russian Jews in the early 1880s.&lt; In response, the &quot;Jewish Chronicle&quot; attacked Gladstone in 1888, arguing that &quot;Are we, because there was once a Liberal Party, to bow down and worship Gladstone – the great Minister who was too Christian in his charity, too Russian in his proclivities, to raise voice or finger&quot; to defend Russian Jews...

During the 1879 election campaign, called the Midlothian campaign, he rousingly denounced Disraeli&#x27;s foreign policies during the ongoing Second Anglo-Afghan War in Afghanistan (see Great Game). He saw the war as &quot;great dishonour&quot; and also criticised British conduct in the Zulu War. Gladstone also (on 29 November) condemned what he saw as the Conservative government&#x27;s profligate spending:
...the Chancellor of the Exchequer shall boldly uphold economy in detail; and it is the mark ... of ... a chicken-hearted Chancellor of the Exchequer, when he shrinks from upholding economy in detail, when, because it is a question of only £2,000 or £3,000, he says that is no matter. He is ridiculed, no doubt, for what is called saving candle-ends and cheese-parings. No Chancellor of the Exchequer is worth his salt who is not ready to save what are meant by candle-ends and cheese-parings in the cause of his country. No Chancellor of the Exchequer is worth his salt who makes his own popularity either his first consideration, or any consideration at all, in administrating the public purse. You would not like to have a housekeeper or steward who made her or his popularity with the tradesmen the measure of the payments that were to be delivered to them. In my opinion the Chancellor of the Exchequer is the trusted and confidential steward of the public. He is under a sacred obligation with regard to all that he consents to spend... I am bound to say hardly ever in the six years that Sir Stafford Northcote has been in office have I heard him speak a resolute word on behalf of economy.

==Second premiership (1880–1885)==


In 1880, the Liberals won again and the Liberal leaders, Lord Hartington (leader in the House of Commons) and Lord Granville, retired in Gladstone&#x27;s favour. Gladstone won his constituency election in Midlothian and also in Leeds, where he had also been adopted as a candidate. As he could lawfully only serve as MP for one constituency, Leeds was passed to his son Herbert. One of his other sons, Henry, was also elected as an MP. Queen Victoria asked Lord Hartington to form a ministry, but he persuaded her to send for Gladstone. Gladstone&#x27;s second administration – both as Prime Minister and again as Chancellor of the Exchequer until 1882 – lasted from June 1880 to June 1885. He originally intended to retire at the end of 1882, the 50th anniversary of his entry into politics, but did not do so.

===Foreign policy===

Historians have debated the wisdom of Gladstone&#x27;s foreign policy during his second ministry. Paul Hayes says it &quot;provides one of the most intriguing and perplexing tales of muddle and incompetence in foreign affairs, unsurpassed in modern political history until the days of Grey and, later, Neville Chamberlain.&quot; Gladstone opposed himself to the &quot;colonial lobby&quot; pushing for the scramble for Africa. His term saw the end of the Second Anglo-Afghan War, the First Boer War, and the war against the Mahdi in Sudan.

On 11 July 1882, Gladstone ordered the bombardment of Alexandria, starting the short, Anglo-Egyptian War of 1882. The British won decisively, and although they repeatedly promised to depart in a few years, the actual result was British control of Egypt for four decades, largely ignoring Ottoman nominal ownership. France was seriously unhappy, having lost control of the canal that it built and financed and had dreamed of for decades. Gladstone&#x27;s role in the decision to invade was described as relatively hands-off, and the ultimate responsibility was borne by certain members of his cabinet such as Lord Hartington, Secretary of State for India; Thomas Baring, 1st Earl of Northbrook, First Lord of the Admiralty; Hugh Childers, Secretary of State for War; and Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville, the Foreign Secretary.

Historian A. J. P. Taylor says that the seizure of Egypt &quot;was a great event; indeed, the only real event in international relations between the Battle of Sedan and the defeat of Russia in the Russo-Japanese war.&quot;
Taylor emphasizes long-term impact:

Gladstone and the Liberals had a reputation for strong opposition to imperialism, so historians have long debated the explanation for this reversal of policy. The most influential was a study by John Robinson and Ronald Gallagher, &quot;Africa and the Victorians&quot; (1961), which focused on The Imperialism of Free Trade and was promoted by the Cambridge School of historiography. They argue there was no long-term Liberal plan in support of imperialism. Instead, they saw the urgent necessity to act to protect the Suez Canal in the face of what appeared to be a radical collapse of law and order, and a nationalist revolt focused on expelling the Europeans, regardless of the damage it would do to international trade and the British Empire. Gladstone&#x27;s decision came against strained relations with France and manoeuvring by &quot;men on the spot&quot; in Egypt. Critics such as Cain and Hopkins have stressed the need to protect large sums invested by British financiers and Egyptian bonds while downplaying the risk to the viability of the Suez Canal. Unlike the Marxists, they stress &quot;gentlemanly&quot; financial and commercial interests, not the industrial capitalism that Marxists believe was always central. More recently, specialists on Egypt have been interested primarily in the internal dynamics among Egyptians that produce the failed Urabi Revolt.

===Ireland===

In 1881 he established the Irish Coercion Act, which permitted the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland to detain people for as &quot;long as was thought necessary&quot;, as there was rural disturbance in Ireland between landlords and tenants as Cavendish, the Irish Secretary, had been assassinated by Irish rebels in Dublin. He also passed the Second Land Act (the First, in 1870, had entitled Irish tenants, if evicted, to compensation for improvements which they had made on their property, but had little effect) which gave Irish tenants the &quot;3Fs&quot; – fair rent, fixity of tenure and free sale. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1881.

===Franchise===
Gladstone extended the vote to agricultural labourers and others in the 1884 Reform Act, which gave the counties the same franchise as the boroughs – adult male householders and £10 lodgers – and added six million to the total number of people who could vote in parliamentary elections. Parliamentary reform continued with the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885.

Gladstone was increasingly uneasy about the direction in which British politics was moving. In a letter to Lord Acton on 11 February 1885, Gladstone criticised Tory Democracy as &quot;demagogism&quot; that &quot;put down pacific, law-respecting, economic elements that ennobled the old Conservatism&quot; but &quot;still, in secret, as obstinately attached as ever to the evil principle of class interests&quot;. He found contemporary Liberalism better, &quot;but far from being good&quot;. Gladstone claimed that this Liberalism&#x27;s &quot;pet idea is what they call construction, – that is to say, taking into the hands of the state the business of the individual man&quot;. Both Tory Democracy and this new Liberalism, Gladstone wrote, had done &quot;much to estrange me, and had for many, many years&quot;.

===Failure===
Historian Sneh Mahajan has concluded that &quot;Gladstone&#x27;s second ministry remained barren of any achievement in the domestic sphere&quot;. His downfall came in Africa, where he delayed the mission to rescue General Gordon&#x27;s force which had been under siege in Khartoum for 10 months. It arrived in January 1885 two days after a massacre killed approximately 7,000 British and Egyptian soldiers and 4,000 civilians. The disaster proved a major blow to Gladstone&#x27;s popularity. Queen Victoria sent him a telegram of rebuke which found its way into the press. Critics said Gladstone had neglected military affairs and had not acted promptly enough to save the besieged Gordon. Critics inverted his acronym, &quot;G.O.M.&quot; (for &quot;Grand Old Man&quot;), to &quot;M.O.G.&quot; (for &quot;Murderer of Gordon&quot;). He resigned as prime minister in June 1885 and declined Queen Victoria&#x27;s offer of an earldom.

==Third premiership (1886)==
The Hawarden Kite was a December 1885 press release by Gladstone&#x27;s son and aide Herbert Gladstone announcing that he had become convinced that Ireland needed a separate parliament. The bombshell announcement resulted in the fall of Lord Salisbury&#x27;s Conservative government. Irish Nationalists, led by Charles Parnell&#x27;s Irish Parliamentary Party, held the balance of power in Parliament. Gladstone&#x27;s conversion to Home Rule convinced them to switch away from the Conservatives and support the Liberals using the 86 seats in Parliament they controlled. The main purpose of this administration was to deliver Ireland a reform that would give it a devolved assembly, similar to those which would eventually be put in place in Scotland and Wales in 1999. In 1886 Gladstone&#x27;s party allied with Irish Nationalists to defeat Lord Salisbury&#x27;s government. Gladstone regained his position as prime minister and combined the office with that of Lord Privy Seal. During this administration, he first introduced his Home Rule Bill for Ireland. The issue split the Liberal Party (a breakaway group went on to create the Liberal Unionist party) and the bill was thrown out on the second reading, ending his government after only a few months and inaugurating another headed by Lord Salisbury.

Gladstone, says his biographer, &quot;totally rejected the widespread English view that the Irish had no taste for justice, common sense, moderation or national prosperity and looked only to perpetual strife and dissension&quot;. The problem for Gladstone was that his rural English supporters would not support Home Rule for Ireland. A large faction of Liberals, led by Joseph Chamberlain, formed a Unionist faction that supported the Conservative party. Whenever the Liberals were out of power, Home Rule proposals languished.

==Opposition (1886–1892)==
Gladstone supported the London dockers in their strike of 1889. After their victory he gave a speech at Hawarden on 23 September in which he said: &quot;In the common interests of humanity, this remarkable strike and the results of this strike, which have tended somewhat to strengthen the condition of labour in the face of capital, is the record of what we ought to regard as satisfactory, as a real social advance [that] tends to a fair principle of division of the fruits of industry&quot;. This speech has been described by Eugenio Biagini as having &quot;no parallel in the rest of Europe except in the rhetoric of the toughest socialist leaders&quot;. Visitors at Hawarden in October were &quot;shocked...by some rather wild language on the Dock labourers question&quot;. Gladstone was impressed with workers unconnected with the dockers&#x27; dispute who &quot;intended to make common cause&quot; in the interests of justice.

On 23 October at Southport, Gladstone delivered a speech where he said that the right to combination, which in London was &quot;innocent and lawful, in Ireland would be penal and...punished by imprisonment with hard labour&quot;. Gladstone believed that the right to combination used by British workers was in jeopardy when it could be denied to Irish workers. In October 1890 Gladstone at Midlothian claimed that competition between capital and labour, &quot;where it has gone to sharp issues, where there have been strikes on one side and lock-outs on the other, I believe that in the main and as a general rule, the labouring man has been in the right&quot;.

On 11 December 1891 Gladstone said that: &quot;It is a lamentable fact if, in the midst of our civilisation, and at the close of the nineteenth century, the workhouse is all that can be offered to the industrious labourer at the end of a long and honourable life. I do not enter into the question now in detail. I do not say it is an easy one; I do not say that it will be solved in a moment; but I do say this, that until society is able to offer to the industrious labourer at the end of a long and blameless life something better than the workhouse, society will not have discharged its duties to its poorer members&quot;. On 24 March 1892 Gladstone said that the Liberals had:

...come generally...to the conclusion that there is something painful in the condition of the rural labourer in this great respect, that it is hard even for the industrious and sober man, under ordinary conditions, to secure a provision for his own old age. Very large propositions, involving, some of them, very novel and very wide principles, have been submitted to the public, for the purpose of securing such a provision by means independent of the labourer himself...our duty [is] to develop in the first instance, every means that we may possibly devise whereby, if possible, the labourer may be able to make this provision for himself, or to approximate towards making such provision far more efficaciously and much more closely than he can now do. Gladstone wrote on 16 July 1892 in &quot;autobiographica&quot; that &quot;In 1834 the Government...did themselves high honour by the new Poor Law Act, which rescued the English peasantry from the total loss of their independence&quot;. There were many who disagreed with him.

Gladstone wrote to Herbert Spencer, who contributed the introduction to a collection of anti-socialist essays (&quot;A Plea for Liberty&quot;, 1891), that &quot;I ask to make reserves, and of one passage, which will be easily guessed, I am unable even to perceive the relevancy. But speaking generally, I have read this masterly argument with warm admiration and with the earnest hope that it may attract all the attention which it so well deserves&quot;. The passage Gladstone alluded to was one where Spencer had spoken of &quot;the behaviour of the so-called Liberal party&quot;.

==Fourth premiership (1892–1894)==

The general election of 1892 resulted in a minority Liberal government with Gladstone as prime minister. The electoral address had promised Irish Home Rule and the disestablishment of the Scottish and Welsh Churches. In February 1893 he introduced the Second Home Rule Bill, which was passed in the Commons at the second reading on 21 April by 43 votes and the third reading on 1 September by 34 votes. The House of Lords defeated the bill by voting against it by 419 votes to 41 on 8 September.

The Elementary Education (Blind and Deaf Children) Act, passed in 1893, required local authorities to provide separate education for blind and deaf children.

Conservative MP Colonel Howard Vincent questioned Gladstone in the Commons on what his government would do about unemployment on 1 September 1893. Gladstone replied: I cannot help regretting that the honourable and gallant Gentleman has felt it his duty to put the question. It is put under circumstances that naturally belong to one of those fluctuations in the condition of trade which, however unfortunate and lamentable they may be, recur from time to time. Undoubtedly I think that questions of this kind, whatever be the intention of the questioner, have a tendency to produce in the minds of people or to suggest to the people, that these fluctuations can be corrected by the action of the Executive Government. Anything that contributes to such an impression inflicts an injury upon the labouring population.

In December 1893, an Opposition motion proposed by Lord George Hamilton called for an expansion of the Royal Navy. Gladstone opposed increasing public expenditure on the naval estimates, in the tradition of free trade liberalism of his earlier political career as Chancellor. All his Cabinet colleagues believed in some expansion of the navy. He declared in the Commons on 19 December that naval rearmament would commit the government to expenditure over a number of years and would subvert &quot;the principle of annual account, annual proposition, annual approval by the House of Commons, which...is the only way of maintaining regularity, and that regularity is the only talisman which will secure Parliamentary control&quot;. In January 1894, Gladstone wrote that he would not &quot;break to pieces the continuous action of my political life, nor trample on the tradition received from every colleague who has ever been my teacher&quot; by supporting naval rearmament. Gladstone also opposed Chancellor Sir William Harcourt&#x27;s proposal to implement a graduated death duty. In a fragment of autobiography dated 25 July 1894, Gladstone denounced the tax as

...by far the most Radical measure of my lifetime. I do not object to the principle of graduated taxation: for the just principle of the ability to pay is not determined simply by the amount of income... But, so far as I understand the present measure of finance from the partial reports I have received, I find it too violent. It involves a great departure from the methods of political action established in this country, where reforms, and especially financial reforms, have always been considerate and even tender... I do not yet see the ground on which it can be justly held that any one description of &quot;property&quot; should be more heavily burdened than others unless moral and social grounds can be shown first: but in this case, the reasons drawn from those sources seem rather to verge in the opposite direction, for real property has more of presumptive connection with the discharge of duty than that which is ranked as personal...the aspect of the measure is not satisfactory to a man of my traditions (and these traditions lie near the roots of my being)... For the sudden introduction of such change, there is I think no precedent in the history of this country. And the severity of the blow is greatly aggravated in moral effect by the fact that it is dealt only to a handful of individuals.

Gladstone had his last audience with Queen Victoria on 28 February 1894 and chaired his last Cabinet on 1 March – the last of 556 he had chaired. On that day he gave his last speech to the House of Commons, saying that the government would withdraw opposition to the Lords&#x27; amendments to the Local Government Bill &quot;under protest&quot; and that it was &quot;a controversy which, when once raised, must go forward to an issue&quot;. He resigned from the premiership on 2 March. The Queen did not ask Gladstone who should succeed him but sent for Lord Rosebery (Gladstone would have advised on Lord Spencer). He retained his seat in the House of Commons until 1895. He was not offered a peerage, having earlier declined an earldom.

Gladstone is both the oldest person to form a government – aged 82 at his appointment – and the oldest person to occupy the Premiership – being 84 at his resignation.

==Final years (1894–1898)==

In 1895, at the age of 85, Gladstone bequeathed £40,000 (equivalent to approximately £ today) and much of his 32,000 volume library to found St Deiniol&#x27;s Library in Hawarden, Wales. It had begun with just 5,000 items at his father&#x27;s home Fasque, which were transferred to Hawarden for research in 1851.

On 8 January 1896, in conversation with L. A. Tollemache, Gladstone explained that: &quot;I am not so much afraid of Democracy or of Science as of the love of money. This seems to me to be a growing evil. Also, there is a danger from the growth of that dreadful military spirit&quot;. On 13 January, Gladstone claimed he had strong Conservative instincts and that &quot;In all matters of custom and tradition, even the Tories look upon me as the chief Conservative that is&quot;. On 15 January Gladstone wrote to James Bryce, describing himself as &quot;a dead man, one fundamentally a Peel–Cobden man&quot;. In 1896, in his last noteworthy speech, he denounced Armenian massacres by Ottomans in a talk delivered at Liverpool. On 2 January 1897, Gladstone wrote to Francis Hirst on being unable to draft a preface to a book on liberalism: &quot;I venture on assuring you that I regard the design formed by you and your friends with sincere interest, and in particular wish well to all the efforts you may make on behalf of individual freedom and independence as opposed to what is termed Collectivism&quot;.

In the early months of 1897, Gladstone and his wife stayed in Cannes. Gladstone met Queen Victoria, and she shook hands with him for (to his recollection) the first time in the 50 years he had known her. One of the Gladstones&#x27; neighbours observed that &quot;He and his devoted wife never missed the morning service on Sunday ... One Sunday, returning from the altar rail, the old, partially blind man stumbled at the chancel step. One of the clergy sprang involuntarily to his assistance but retreated with haste, so withering was the fire which flashed from those failing eyes.&quot; The Gladstones returned to Hawarden Castle at the end of March and he received the Colonial Premiers in their visit for the Queen&#x27;s Jubilee. At a dinner in November with Edward Hamilton, his former private secretary, Hamilton noted that &quot;What is now uppermost in his mind is what he calls the spirit of jingoism under the name of Imperialism which is now so prevalent&quot;. Gladstone riposted &quot;It was enough to make Peel and Cobden turn in their graves&quot;.

On the advice of his doctor Samuel Habershon in the aftermath of an attack of facial neuralgia, Gladstone stayed at Cannes from the end of November 1897 to mid-February 1898. He gave an interview for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. Gladstone then travelled to Bournemouth, where a swelling on his palate was diagnosed as cancer by the leading cancer surgeon Sir Thomas Smith on 18 March. On 22 March, he retired to Hawarden Castle. Despite being in pain he received visitors and quoted hymns, especially Cardinal Newman&#x27;s &quot;Praise to the Holiest in the Height&quot;.
His last public statement was dictated to his daughter Helen in reply to receiving the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford&#x27;s &quot;sorrow and affection&quot;: &quot;There is no expression of Christian sympathy that I value more than that of the ancient University of Oxford, the God-fearing and God-sustaining University of Oxford. I served her perhaps mistakenly, but to the best of my ability. My most earnest prayers are hers to the uttermost and to the last&quot;. He left the house for the last time on 9 April. After 18 April he did not come down to the ground floor but still came out of bed to lie on the sofa. The Bishop of St Andrews, Dunkeld and Dunblane George Wilkinson recorded when he ministered to him along with Stephen Gladstone: Shall I ever forget the last Friday in Passion Week, when I gave him the last Holy Communion that I was allowed to administer to him? It was early in the morning. He was obliged to be in bed, and he was ordered to remain there, but the time had come for the confession of sin and the receiving of absolution. Out of his bed he came. Alone he knelt in the presence of his God till the absolution has been spoken, and the sacred elements received.
Gladstone died on 19 May 1898 at Hawarden Castle aged 88. He had been cared for by his daughter Helen who had resigned from her job to care for her father and mother. The cause of death is officially recorded as &quot;Syncope, Senility&quot;. &quot;Syncope&quot; meant failure of the heart and &quot;senility&quot; in the 19th century was an infirmity of advanced old age, rather than a loss of mental faculties. The House of Commons adjourned on the afternoon of Gladstone&#x27;s death, with A. J. Balfour giving notice for an Address to the Queen praying for a public funeral and a public memorial in Westminster Abbey. The day after, both Houses of Parliament approved the Address and Herbert Gladstone accepted a public funeral on behalf of the Gladstone family. His coffin was transported on the London Underground before his state funeral at Westminster Abbey, at which the Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VII) and the Duke of York (the future King George V) acted as pallbearers. His wife, Catherine Gladstone (&quot;née&quot; Glynne), died two years later on 14 June 1900 and was buried next to him.
==Religion==
Gladstone&#x27;s intensely religious mother was an evangelical of Scottish Episcopal origins, and his father joined the Church of England, having been a Presbyterian when he first settled in Liverpool. As a boy, William was baptised into the Church of England. He rejected a call to enter the ministry, and on this his conscience always tormented him. In compensation, he aligned his politics with the evangelical faith in which he fervently believed. In 1838 Gladstone nearly ruined his career when he tried to force a religious mission upon the Conservative Party. His book &quot;The State in its Relations with the Church&quot; argued that England had neglected its great duty to the Church of England. He announced that since that church possessed a monopoly of religious truth, nonconformists and Roman Catholics ought to be excluded from all government positions. The historian Thomas Babington Macaulay and other critics ridiculed his arguments and refuted them. Sir Robert Peel, Gladstone&#x27;s chief, was outraged because this would upset the delicate political issue of Catholic Emancipation and anger the Nonconformists. Since Peel greatly admired his protégé, he redirected his focus from theology to finance.

Gladstone altered his approach to religious problems, which always held first place in his mind. Before entering Parliament he had already substituted a high church Anglican attitude, with its dependence on authority and tradition, for the evangelical outlook of his boyhood, with its reliance upon the direct inspiration of the Bible. In middle life, he decided that the individual conscience would have to replace authority as the inner citadel of the Church. That view of the individual conscience affected his political outlook and changed him gradually from a Conservative into a Liberal.

==Attitude towards slavery==
Initially a disciple of High Toryism, Gladstone&#x27;s maiden speech as a young Tory was a defence of the rights of West Indian sugar plantation magnates (slave owners) among whom his father was prominent. He immediately came under attack from anti-slavery elements. He also surprised the duke by urging the need to increase pay for unskilled factory workers.

Gladstone&#x27;s early attitude towards slavery was highly shaped by his father, Sir John Gladstone, one of the largest slave owners in the British Empire. Gladstone wanted gradual rather than immediate emancipation, and proposed that slaves should serve a period of apprenticeship after being freed. They also opposed the international slave trade (which lowered the value of the slaves the father already owned). The anti-slavery movement demanded the immediate abolition of slavery. Gladstone opposed this and said in 1832 that emancipation should come after moral emancipation through the adoption of education and the inculcation of &quot;honest and industrious habits&quot; among the slaves. Then &quot;with the utmost speed that prudence will permit, we shall arrive at that exceedingly desired consummation, the utter extinction of slavery.&quot; In 1831, when the Oxford Union considered a motion in favour of the immediate emancipation of the slaves in the West Indies, Gladstone moved an amendment in favour of gradual manumission along with better protection for the personal and civil rights of the slaves and better provision for their Christian education. His early Parliamentary speeches followed a similar line: in June 1833, Gladstone concluded his speech on the &#x27;slavery question&#x27; by declaring that though he had dwelt on &quot;the dark side&quot; of the issue, he looked forward to &quot;a safe and gradual emancipation&quot;.

In 1834, when slavery was abolished across the British Empire, the owners were paid full value for the slaves. Gladstone helped his father obtain £106,769 () in official reimbursement by the government for the 2,508 slaves he owned across nine plantations in the Caribbean.

In later years Gladstone&#x27;s attitude towards slavery became more critical as his father&#x27;s influence over his politics diminished. In 1844 Gladstone broke with his father when, as President of the Board of Trade, he advanced proposals to halve duties on foreign sugar not produced by slave labour, in order to &quot;secure the effectual exclusion of slave-grown sugar&quot; and to encourage Brazil and Spain to end slavery. Sir John Gladstone, who opposed any reduction in duties on foreign sugar, wrote a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; criticizing the measure. Looking back late in life, Gladstone named the abolition of slavery as one of ten great achievements of the previous sixty years where the masses had been right and the upper classes had been wrong.

Shortly after the outbreak of the American Civil War Gladstone wrote to his friend the Duchess of Sutherland that &quot;the principle announced by the vice-president of the South...which asserts the superiority of the white man, and therewith founds on it his right to hold the black in slavery, I think that principle detestable, and I am wholly with the opponents of it&quot; but that he felt that the North was wrong to try to restore the Union by military force, which he believed would end in failure.

In a memorandum to the Cabinet later that month Gladstone wrote that, although he believed the Confederacy would probably win the war, it was &quot;seriously tainted by its connection with slavery&quot; and argued that the European powers should use their influence on the South to effect the &quot;mitigation or removal of slavery.&quot;

==Marriage and family==

Gladstone&#x27;s early attempts to find a wife proved unsuccessful; he was rejected in 1835 by Caroline Eliza Farquhar (daughter of Sir Thomas Harvie Farquhar, 2nd Baronet) and again in 1837 by Lady Frances Harriet Douglas (daughter of George Douglas, 17th Earl of Morton).

The following year, having met Catherine Glynne in 1834 at the London home of Old Etonian friend and then fellow-Conservative MP James Milnes Gaskell, he married her on 25 July 1839 – a joint wedding shared with Catherine&#x27;s sister Mary Glynne and betrothed George Lyttelton. Catherine and William remained married until Gladstone&#x27;s death 59 years later and had eight children together:
* William Henry Gladstone MP (1840–1891); married Hon. Gertrude Stuart (daughter of Charles Stuart, 12th Lord Blantyre) in 1875. They had three children.
* Agnes Gladstone (1842–1931); she married Very Rev. Edward Wickham in 1873. They had four children.
* The Rev. Stephen Edward Gladstone (1844–1920); married Annie Wilson in 1885. They had five children: their eldest son Albert, inherited the Gladstone baronetcy in 1945.
* Catherine Jessy Gladstone (1845–1850); died aged 5 on 9 April 1850 from meningitis
* Mary Gladstone (1847–1927); she married Reverend Harry Drew in 1886. They had one daughter, Dorothy.

Gladstone&#x27;s eldest son William (known as &quot;Willy&quot; to distinguish him from his father), and youngest, Herbert, both became Members of Parliament. Henry and Herbert became Peers (a Baron and a Viscount) and so members of the House of Lords. William Henry predeceased his father by seven years. Gladstone&#x27;s private secretary was his nephew Spencer Lyttelton.

===Descendants===

Two of Gladstone&#x27;s sons and a grandson, William Glynne Charles Gladstone, followed him into parliament, making for four generations of MPs in total. One of his collateral descendants, George Freeman, has been the Conservative Member of Parliament for Mid Norfolk since 2010.

Sir Albert Gladstone, 5th baronet, an Olympic Games rowing champion, and Sir Charles Gladstone, 6th baronet (from whom the 7th and 8th baronets are descended) were also grandsons.

==Legacy==
The historian H. C. G. Matthew states that Gladstone&#x27;s chief legacy lay in three areas: his financial policy, his support for Home Rule (devolution) that modified the view of the unitary state of the United Kingdom and his idea of a progressive, reforming party broadly based and capable of accommodating and conciliating varying interests, along with his speeches at mass public meetings.

Historian Walter L. Arnstein concludes:
Lord Acton wrote in 1880 that he considered Gladstone one &quot;of the three greatest Liberals&quot; (along with Edmund Burke and Lord Macaulay).

In 1909 the Liberal Chancellor David Lloyd George introduced his &quot;People&#x27;s Budget&quot;, the first budget which aimed to redistribute wealth. The Liberal statesman Lord Rosebery ridiculed it by asserting Gladstone would reject it, &quot;Because in his eyes, and in my eyes, too as his humble disciple, Liberalism and Liberty were cognate terms; they were twin-sisters.&quot;

Lloyd George had written in 1913 that the Liberals were &quot;carving the last few columns out of the Gladstonian quarry&quot;.

Lloyd George said of Gladstone in 1915: &quot;What a man he was! Head and shoulders above anyone else I have ever seen in the House of Commons. I did not like him much. He hated Nonconformists and Welsh Nonconformists in particular and he had no real sympathy with the working classes. But he was far and away the best Parliamentary speaker I have ever heard. He was not so good in exposition.&quot; Asquithian Liberals continued to advocate traditional Gladstonian policies of sound finance, peaceful foreign relations and the better treatment of Ireland. They often compared Lloyd George unfavourably with Gladstone.

Writing in 1944, the classical liberal economist Friedrich Hayek said of the change in political attitudes that had occurred since the Great War: &quot;Perhaps nothing shows this change more clearly than that, while there is no lack of sympathetic treatment of Bismarck in contemporary English literature, the name of Gladstone is rarely mentioned by the younger generation without a sneer over his Victorian morality and naive utopianism.&quot;

In the latter half of the 20th century, Thatcherite Conservatives began to claim association with Gladstone and his economic policies. Margaret Thatcher proclaimed in 1983: &quot;We have a duty to make sure that every penny piece we raise in taxation is spent wisely and well. For it is our party which is dedicated to good housekeeping – indeed, I would not mind betting that if Mr. Gladstone were alive today he would apply to join the Conservative Party.&quot; In 1996, she said: &quot;The kind of Conservatism which he and I...favoured would be best described as &#x27;liberal&#x27;, in the old-fashioned sense. And I mean the liberalism of Mr Gladstone, not of the latter-day collectivists.&quot; Nigel Lawson, one of Thatcher&#x27;s Chancellors, called Gladstone the &quot;greatest Chancellor of all time&quot;.

===Rivalry with Disraeli===
Historical writers have often played Disraeli and Gladstone against each other as great rivals. Roland Quinault, however, cautions us not to exaggerate the confrontation:

Streets in Sofia, Plovdiv, Kazanlak Bulgaria named after him.

==Monuments and collections==

===Collections===
* Lambeth Palace holds Gladstone&#x27;s diaries.
* The British Library holds the Gladstone Papers, which contains Gladstone&#x27;s political correspondence and papers.
* Gladstone&#x27;s Library holds Gladstone&#x27;s personal collection of books used to found the Library in its Foundation Collection and the Glynne-Gladstone Archive, which contains Gladstone&#x27;s personal papers and correspondence. They also hold copies of the papers, on microfilm, related to Gladstone and held by the British Library and the National Library of Wales.
* The National Library of Wales holds many pamphlets that were sent to Gladstone during his political career. These pamphlets show the concerns of people from all strands of society and together form a historical resource of the social and economic conditions of mid- to late nineteenth-century Britain. Many of the pamphlets bear the handwriting of Gladstone, which provides direct evidence of Gladstone&#x27;s interest in various topics.
* Thomas Edison&#x27;s European agent, Colonel Gouraud, recorded Gladstone&#x27;s voice several times on phonograph. A wax cylinder of one of the recordings is held by the BBC Sound Archive. According to H. C. G. Matthew, the voice on the recording has a &quot;slight North Welsh accent&quot;.

===Statues===
* A statue of Gladstone stands prominently in the front grounds of the eponymous Gladstone&#x27;s Library (formerly known as St. Deiniol&#x27;s), near the start of Gladstone Way in Hawarden.

* A statue of Gladstone by Albert Bruce-Joy, erected in 1882, stands near the front gate of St. Marys Church in Bow, London. Paid for by the industrialist Theodore Bryant, it is viewed as a symbol of the later 1888 match girls strike, which took place at the nearby Bryant &amp; May Match Factory. Led by the socialist Annie Besant, hundreds of women working in the factory, where many sickened and died from poisoning from the white phosphorus used in the matches, went on strike to demand improved working conditions and pay, eventually winning their cause. In recent years, the statue of Gladstone has been repeatedly daubed with red paint, suggesting that it was paid for with the &quot;blood of the match girls&quot;.
* A statue of Gladstone in bronze by Sir Thomas Brock, erected in 1904, stands in St John&#x27;s Gardens, Liverpool.
* The Gladstone Memorial, erected in 1905, stands at Aldwych, London, near the Royal Courts of Justice.
* A Grade II listed statue of Gladstone stands in Albert Square, Manchester.
* A monument to Gladstone, Member of Parliament for Midlothian 1880–1895, was unveiled in Edinburgh in 1917 (and moved to its present location in 1955). It stands in Atholl Crescent Gardens. The sculptor was James Pittendrigh MacGillivray.
* A statue to Gladstone, who was Rector of the University of Glasgow 1877–1880, was unveiled in Glasgow in 1902. It stands in George Square. The sculptor was Sir William Hamo Thornycroft.
* A bust of Gladstone is in the Hall of Heroes of the National Wallace Monument in Stirling.
* Near Hawarden in the town of Mancot, there is a small hospital named after Catherine Gladstone. 
* A statue of Gladstone stands in front of the Kapodistrian University building in the centre of Athens.
* A statue of Gladstone was unveiled in Front Quad at Glenalmond College in 2010.
* A Gladstone memorial was unveiled on 23 February 2013 in Seaforth, Liverpool, by MP Frank Field. It is in the grounds of Our Lady Star of the Sea Church facing the former site of St Thomas&#x27;s Church where Gladstone was educated from 1816 to 1821. The Seaglam (Seaforth Gladstone Memorial) Project, whose chairman is local historian Brenda Murray (BEM), was started to raise the profile of Seaforth Village by installing a memorial to Gladstone. Funds for the memorial were raised by voluntary effort and the Heritage Lottery Fund provided additional funding. Sculptor Tom Murphy created the bronze bust.
* A statue of Gladstone was unveiled on the Boulevard in Blackburn, Lancashire on 4 November 1899 by the Earl of Aberdeen. The statue, sculpted by John Adams-Acton at a cost of £3,000, bears the inscription &quot;The most brilliant intellect that has been placed at the service of the state since parliamentary government began – Salisbury&quot;. It was later moved to Blakey Moor and in 1983 was moved again to Northgate. In 2020 there were calls for the statue to be removed.

===Namesakes===

* Gladstone Park in the Municipal Borough of Willesden, London, was named after him in 1899. Dollis Hill House, within what later became the park, was occupied by Sir Dudley Coutts Marjoribanks, who subsequently became Lord Tweedmouth. In 1881 Lord Tweedmouth&#x27;s daughter and her husband, Lord Aberdeen, took up residence. They often had Gladstone to stay as a guest. In 1897 Lord Aberdeen was appointed Governor General of Canada and the Aberdeens moved out. When Willesden acquired the house and land in 1899, they named the park Gladstone Park after the old Prime Minister.
* Gladstone Rock, a large boulder about 12 ft high in Cwm Llan on the Watkin Path on the south side of Snowdon where Gladstone made a speech in 1892, was named for him. A plaque on the rock states that he &quot;addressed the people of Eryri upon justice to Wales&quot;.
* Gladstone, Oregon; Gladstone, New Jersey; Gladstone, Michigan; Gladstone, Missouri; and Gladstone, New Mexico, in the United States are named for him. The city of Gladstone, Queensland, Australia, was named after him and has a 19th-century marble statue on display in its town museum.
* Gladstone, Manitoba, was named after him in 1882.
* Streets in the cities of Athens, Sofia (including a school), Plovdiv, Varna, Burgas, Ruse, Stara Zagora, Limassol, Springs, Newark-on-Trent, Waterford City, Clonmel, Baltimore, MD., Brighton, Bradford, London (in Lambeth, Merton Park and South Acton), Scarborough, Swindon, Vancouver (including a school), Windsor, Ottawa, Toronto, Halifax and Brisbane are named for him. There is also Gladstone Avenue and adjoining Ewart Road in his hometown of Liverpool in a part of the city where he was a landowner.
* There is an imposing &#x27;Arts and Crafts&#x27; pub in Dulwich Hill, a suburb of Sydney, Australia, named for him on the corner of Marrickville Road and New Canterbury Road; also a street is named for him in Dulwich Hill (Ewart Street) which crosses into the adjoining suburb of Marrickville. On Ewart Street there is a mansion called &#x27;Gladstone Hall&#x27; built in 1870 by William Starkey, founder of Starkey&#x27;s Ginger Beer and cordial factory in 1838 which became the largest of its type in the southern hemisphere for some time. Gladstone Park is in the Sydney suburb of Balmain. The Lord Gladstone Hotel is on the corner of Meagher and Regent Street in Chippendale, Sydney. 
* At the University of Liverpool, there is Gladstone Hall of Residence, and the Gladstone Professor of Greek.
* The Gladstone bag, a light travelling bag, is named after him.
* The Gladstone Theatre is in Port Sunlight, Wirral, across the Mersey from Liverpool, where Gladstone was born.
* The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway B1 Class steam locomotives were known as the &quot;Gladstones&quot;, after the first member of its class.

==In popular culture==
Gladstone was popularly known in his later years as the &quot;Grand Old Man&quot; or &quot;G.O.M.&quot;. The term was used occasionally during the Midlothian election campaign, first became widely associated with him during the 1880 general election, and was ubiquitous in the press by 1882. Henry Labouchère and Sir Stafford Northcote have both been credited with coining it; it appears to have been in use before either of them used it publicly, though they may have helped popularise it. While it was originally used to show affectionate reverence, it was quickly adopted more sarcastically by his opponents, using it to emphasise his age. The acronym was sometimes satirised as &quot;God&#x27;s Only Mistake&quot;, or after the fall of Khartoum, inverted to &quot;M.O.G.&quot;, &quot;Murderer of Gordon&quot;. (Disraeli is often credited with the former, but Lord Salisbury is a more likely origin.) The term is still widely used today and is virtually synonymous with Gladstone.

Gladstone&#x27;s burial in 1898 was commemorated in a poem by William McGonagall.

<text>WordNet is a lexical database of semantic relations between words that links words into semantic relations including synonyms, hyponyms, and meronyms. The synonyms are grouped into &quot;synsets&quot; with short definitions and usage examples. It can thus be seen as a combination and extension of a dictionary and thesaurus. Its primary use is in automatic text analysis and artificial intelligence applications. It was first created in the English language and the English WordNet database and software tools have been released under a BSD style license and are freely available for download. The latest official release from Princeton was released in 2011. Princeton currently has no plans to release any new versions due to staffing and funding issues. New versions are still being released annually through the Open English WordNet website. Until about 2024 an online version was previously available through wordnet.princeton.edu. That version of WordNet has been deprecated, but a new online version is available at en-word.net. There are now WordNets in more than 200 languages.

== History and team members ==
WordNet was first created in 1985, in English only, in the Cognitive Science Laboratory of Princeton University under the direction of psychology professor George Armitage Miller. It was later directed by Christiane Fellbaum. The project was initially funded by the U.S. Office of Naval Research, and later also by other U.S. government agencies including the DARPA, the National Science Foundation, the Disruptive Technology Office (formerly the Advanced Research and Development Activity) and REFLEX. George Miller and Christiane Fellbaum received the 2006 Antonio Zampolli Prize for their work with WordNet.

The Global WordNet Association is a non-commercial organization that provides a platform for discussing, sharing and connecting WordNets for all languages in the world. Christiane Fellbaum and Piek Th.J.M. Vossen are its co-presidents.

== Database contents ==
The database contains 155,327 words organized in 175,979 synsets for a total of 207,016 word-sense pairs; in compressed form, it is about 12 megabytes in size.

It includes the lexical categories nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs but ignores prepositions, determiners and other function words.

Words from the same lexical category that are roughly synonymous are grouped into synsets, which include simplex words as well as collocations like &quot;eat out&quot; and &quot;car pool.&quot; The different senses of a polysemous word form are assigned to different synsets. A synset&#x27;s meaning is further clarified with a short defining &quot;gloss&quot; and one or more usage examples. An example adjective synset is:

: good, right, ripe – (most suitable or right for a particular purpose; &quot;a good time to plant tomatoes&quot;; &quot;the right time to act&quot;; &quot;the time is ripe for great sociological changes&quot;)

All synsets are connected by means of semantic relations. These relations, which are not all shared by all lexical categories, include:
* Nouns
**&quot;hypernym&quot;: &quot;Y&quot; is a hypernym of &quot;X&quot; if every &quot;X&quot; is a (kind of) &quot;Y&quot; (&quot;canine&quot; is a hypernym of &quot;dog&quot;)
**&quot;hyponym&quot;: &quot;Y&quot; is a hyponym of &quot;X&quot; if every &quot;Y&quot; is a (kind of) &quot;X&quot; (&quot;dog&quot; is a hyponym of &quot;canine&quot;)
**&quot;coordinate term&quot;: &quot;Y&quot; is a coordinate term of &quot;X&quot; if &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; share a hypernym (&quot;wolf&quot; is a coordinate term of &quot;dog&quot;, and &quot;dog&quot; is a coordinate term of &quot;wolf&quot;)
**&quot;holonym&quot;: &quot;Y&quot; is a holonym of &quot;X&quot; if &quot;X&quot; is a part of &quot;Y&quot; (&quot;building&quot; is a holonym of &quot;window&quot;)
**&quot;meronym&quot;: &quot;Y&quot; is a meronym of &quot;X&quot; if &quot;Y&quot; is a part of &quot;X&quot; (&quot;window&quot; is a meronym of &quot;building&quot;)
* Verbs
**&quot;hypernym&quot;: the verb &quot;Y&quot; is a hypernym of the verb &quot;X&quot; if the activity &quot;X&quot; is a (kind of) &quot;Y&quot; (&quot;to perceive&quot; is an hypernym of &quot;to listen&quot;)
**&quot;troponym&quot;: the verb &quot;Y&quot; is a troponym of the verb &quot;X&quot; if the activity &quot;Y&quot; is doing &quot;X&quot; in some manner (&quot;to lisp&quot; is a troponym of &quot;to talk&quot;)
**&quot;entailment&quot;: the verb &quot;Y&quot; is entailed by the verb &quot;X&quot; if by doing &quot;X&quot; you must be doing &quot;Y&quot; (&quot;to sleep&quot; is entailed by &quot;to snore&quot;)
**&quot;coordinate term&quot;: the verb &quot;Y&quot; is a coordinate term of the verb &quot;X&quot; if &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; share a hypernym (&quot;to lisp&quot; is a coordinate term of &quot;to yell&quot;, and &quot;to yell&quot; is a coordinate term of &quot;to lisp&quot;)

These semantic relations hold among all members of the linked synsets. Individual synset members (words) can also be connected with lexical relations. For example, (one sense of) the noun &quot;director&quot; is linked to (one sense of) the verb &quot;direct&quot; from which it is derived via a &quot;morphosemantic&quot; link.

The morphology functions of the software distributed with the database try to deduce the lemma or stem form of a word from the user&#x27;s input. Irregular forms are stored in a list, and looking up &quot;ate&quot; will return &quot;eat,&quot; for example.

== Knowledge structure ==
Both nouns and verbs are organized into hierarchies, defined by hypernym or &quot;IS A&quot; relationships. For instance, one sense of the word &quot;dog&quot; is found following hypernym hierarchy; the words at the same level represent synset members. Each set of synonyms has a unique index.

* dog, domestic dog, Canis familiaris
** canine, canid
*** carnivore
**** placental, placental mammal, eutherian, eutherian mammal
***** mammal
****** vertebrate, craniate
******* chordate
******** animal, animate being, beast, brute, creature, fauna

At the top level, these hierarchies are organized into 25 beginner &quot;trees&quot; for nouns and 15 for verbs (called &quot;lexicographic files&quot; at a maintenance level). All are linked to a unique beginner synset, &quot;entity&quot;.
Noun hierarchies are far deeper than verb hierarchies.

Adjectives are not organized into hierarchical trees. Instead, two &quot;central&quot; antonyms such as &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;cold&quot; form binary poles, while &#x27;satellite&#x27; synonyms such as &quot;steaming&quot; and &quot;chilly&quot; connect to their respective poles via a &quot;similarity&quot; relations. The adjectives can be visualized in this way as &quot;dumbbells&quot; rather than as &quot;trees&quot;.

== Psycholinguistic aspects ==
The initial goal of the WordNet project was to build a lexical database that would be consistent with theories of human semantic memory developed in the late 1960s. Psychological experiments indicated that speakers organized their knowledge of concepts in an economic, hierarchical fashion. Retrieval time required to access conceptual knowledge seemed to be directly related to the number of hierarchies the speaker needed to &quot;traverse&quot; to access the knowledge. Thus, speakers could more quickly verify that &quot;canaries can sing&quot; because a canary is a songbird, but required slightly more time to verify that &quot;canaries can fly&quot; (where they had to access the concept &quot;bird&quot; on the superordinate level) and even more time to verify &quot;canaries have skin&quot; (requiring look-up across multiple levels of hyponymy, up to &quot;animal&quot;).
While such psycholinguistic experiments and the underlying theories have been subject to criticism, some of WordNet&#x27;s organization is consistent with experimental evidence. For example, anomic aphasia selectively affects speakers&#x27; ability to produce words from a specific semantic category, a WordNet hierarchy. Antonymous adjectives (WordNet&#x27;s central adjectives in the dumbbell structure) are found to co-occur far more frequently than chance, a fact that has been found to hold for many languages.

== As a lexical ontology ==
WordNet is sometimes called an ontology, a persistent claim that its creators do not make. The hypernym/hyponym relationships among the noun synsets can be interpreted as specialization relations among conceptual categories. In other words, WordNet can be interpreted and used as a lexical ontology in the computer science sense. However, such an ontology should be corrected before being used, because it contains hundreds of basic semantic inconsistencies; for example there are, (i) common specializations for exclusive categories and (ii) redundancies in the specialization hierarchy. Furthermore, transforming WordNet into a lexical ontology usable for knowledge representation should normally also involve (i) distinguishing the specialization relations into &quot;subtypeOf&quot; and &quot;instanceOf&quot; relations, and (ii) associating intuitive unique identifiers to each category. Although such corrections and transformations have been performed and documented as part of the integration of WordNet 1.7 into the cooperatively updatable knowledge base of WebKB-2, most projects claiming to reuse WordNet for knowledge-based applications (typically, knowledge-oriented information retrieval) simply reuse it directly.

WordNet has also been converted to a formal specification, by means of a hybrid bottom-up top-down methodology to automatically extract association relations from it and interpret these associations in terms of a set of conceptual relations, formally defined in the DOLCE foundational ontology.

In most works that claim to have integrated WordNet into ontologies, the content of WordNet has not simply been corrected when it seemed necessary; instead, it has been heavily reinterpreted and updated whenever suitable. This was the case when, for example, the top-level ontology of WordNet was restructured according to the OntoClean-based approach, or when it was used as a primary source for constructing the lower classes of the SENSUS ontology.

== Limitations ==
The most widely discussed limitation of WordNet (and related resources like ImageNet) is that some of the semantic relations are more suited to concrete concepts than to abstract concepts. For example, it is easy to create hyponyms/hypernym relationships to capture that a &quot;conifer&quot; is a type of &quot;tree&quot;, a &quot;tree&quot; is a type of &quot;plant&quot;, and a &quot;plant&quot; is a type of &quot;organism&quot;, but it is difficult to classify emotions like &quot;fear&quot; or &quot;happiness&quot; into equally deep and well-defined hyponyms/hypernym relationships.

Many of the concepts in WordNet are specific to certain languages and the most accurate reported mapping between languages is 94%. Synonyms, hyponyms, meronyms, and antonyms occur in all languages with a WordNet so far, but other semantic relationships are language-specific. This limits the interoperability across languages. However, it also makes WordNet a resource for highlighting and studying the differences between languages, so it is not necessarily a limitation for all use cases.

WordNet does not include information about the etymology or the pronunciation of words and it contains only limited information about usage. WordNet aims to cover most everyday words and does not include much domain-specific terminology.

WordNet is the most commonly used computational lexicon of English for word-sense disambiguation (WSD), a task aimed at assigning the context-appropriate meanings (i.e. synset members) to words in a text. However, it has been argued that WordNet encodes sense distinctions that are too fine-grained. This issue prevents WSD systems from achieving a level of performance comparable to that of humans, who do not always agree when confronted with the task of selecting a sense from a dictionary that matches a word in a context. The granularity issue has been tackled by proposing clustering methods that automatically group together similar senses of the same word.

=== Offensive content ===
WordNet includes words that can be perceived as pejorative or offensive. The interpretation of a word can change over time and between social groups, so it is not always possible for WordNet to define a word as &quot;pejorative&quot; or &quot;offensive&quot; in isolation. Therefore, people using WordNet must apply their own methods to identify offensive or pejorative words.

However, this limitation is true of other lexical resources like dictionaries and thesauruses, which also contain pejorative and offensive words. Some dictionaries indicate words that are pejoratives, but do not include all the contexts in which words might be acceptable or offensive to different social groups. Therefore, people using dictionaries must apply their own methods to identify all offensive words.

=== Licensed vs. Open WordNets ===
Some wordnets were subsequently created for other languages. A 2012 survey lists the wordnets and their availability. In an effort to propagate the usage of WordNets, the Global WordNet community had been slowly re-licensing their WordNets to an open domain where researchers and developers can easily access and use WordNets as language resources to provide ontological and lexical knowledge in natural-language processing (NLP) tasks.

The Open Multilingual WordNet provides access to open licensed wordnets in a variety of languages, all linked to the Princeton Wordnet of English (PWN). The goal is to make it easy to use wordnets in multiple languages.

== Applications ==
WordNet has been used for a number of purposes in information systems, including word-sense disambiguation, information retrieval, automatic text classification, automatic text summarization, machine translation and even automatic crossword puzzle generation.

A common use of WordNet is to determine the similarity between words. Various algorithms have been proposed, including measuring the distance among words and synsets in WordNet&#x27;s graph structure, such as by counting the number of edges among synsets. The intuition is that the closer two words or synsets are, the closer their meaning. A number of WordNet-based word similarity algorithms are implemented in a Perl package called WordNet::Similarity, and in a Python package called NLTK. Other more sophisticated WordNet-based similarity techniques include ADW, whose implementation is available in Java. WordNet can also be used to inter-link other vocabularies.

== Interfaces ==
Princeton maintains a list of related projects that includes links to some of the widely used application programming interfaces available for accessing WordNet using various programming languages and environments.

== Related projects and extensions ==
WordNet is connected to several databases of the Semantic Web. WordNet is also commonly reused via mappings between the WordNet synsets and the categories from ontologies. Most often, only the top-level categories of WordNet are mapped.

=== Global WordNet Association ===
The Global WordNet Association (GWA) is a public and non-commercial organization that provides a platform for discussing, sharing and connecting wordnets for all languages in the world. The GWA also promotes the standardization of wordnets across languages, to ensure its uniformity in enumerating the synsets in human languages. The GWA keeps a list of wordnets developed around the world.

=== Other languages ===
* Arabic WordNet: WordNet for Arabic language.
* Arabic Ontology, a linguistic ontology that has the same structure as wordnet, and mapped to it. 
* The BalkaNet project has produced WordNets for six European languages (Bulgarian, Czech, Greek, Romanian, Turkish and Serbian). For this project, a freely available XML-based WordNet editor was developed. This editor – VisDic – is not in active development anymore, but is still used for the creation of various WordNets. Its successor, DEBVisDic, is client-server application and is currently used for the editing of several WordNets (Dutch in Cornetto project, Polish, Hungarian, several African languages, Chinese).
* BulNet is a Bulgarian version of the WordNet developed at the Department of Computational Linguistics of the Institute for Bulgarian Language, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.
* CWN (Chinese Wordnet or 中文詞彙網路) supported by National Taiwan University.
* The EuroWordNet project has produced WordNets for several European languages and linked them together; these are not freely available however. The Global Wordnet project attempts to coordinate the production and linking of &quot;wordnets&quot; for all languages. Oxford University Press, the publisher of the Oxford English Dictionary, has voiced plans to produce their own online competitor to WordNet.
* FinnWordNet is a Finnish version of the WordNet where all entries of the original English WordNet were translated.
* GermaNet is a German version of the WordNet developed by the University of Tübingen.
* The IndoWordNet is a linked lexical knowledge base of wordnets of 18 scheduled languages of India viz., Assamese, Bangla, Bodo, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Kashmiri, Konkani, Malayalam, Meitei (Manipuri), Marathi, Nepali, Odia, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu.
* JAWS (Just Another WordNet Subset), another French version of WordNet built using the Wiktionary and semantic spaces
* WordNet Bahasa: WordNet for Malay and Indonesia language, developed by Nanyang University of Technology.
* Malayalam WordNet, developed by Cochin University Of Science and Technology.
* Multilingual Central Repository (MCR) integrates in the same EuroWordNet framework wordnets from Spanish, Catalan, Basque, Galician and Portuguese liked to English.
* The MultiWordNet project, a multilingual WordNet aimed at producing an Italian WordNet strongly aligned with the Princeton WordNet.
* OpenDutchWordNet, is a Dutch lexical semantic database.
* OpenWN-PT is a Brazilian Portuguese version of the original WordNet freely available for download under CC-BY-SA license.
* plWordNet is a Polish-language version of WordNet developed by Wrocław University of Technology.
* PolNet is a Polish-language version of WordNet developed by Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań (distributed under CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 license).
Projects such as BalkaNet and EuroWordNet made it feasible to create standalone wordnets linked to the original one. Two such projects were the Russian WordNet, patronized by Petersburg State University of Means of Communication and led by S.A. Yablonsky, and Russnet, by Saint Petersburg State University.
* UWN is an automatically constructed multilingual lexical knowledge base extending WordNet to cover over a million words in many different languages.
* WOLF (WordNet Libre du Français), a French version of WordNet.

=== Linked data ===
* BabelNet, a very large multilingual semantic network with millions of concepts obtained by integrating WordNet and Wikipedia using an automatic mapping algorithm.
* The SUMO ontology has a complete manual mapping between all of the WordNet synsets and all of SUMO (including its domain ontologies, when WordNet contains a word sense for a given SUMO term) which is browsable at, for example .
* OpenCyc, an open ontology and knowledge base of everyday common sense knowledge, has 12,000 terms linked to WordNet synonym sets.
* DOLCE, is the first module of the WonderWeb Foundational Ontologies Library (WFOL). This upper-ontology has been developed in light of rigorous ontological principles inspired by the philosophical tradition, with a clear orientation toward language and cognition. OntoWordNet is the result of an experimental alignment of WordNet&#x27;s upper level with DOLCE. It is suggested that such alignment could lead to an &quot;ontologically sweetened&quot; WordNet, meant to be conceptually more rigorous, cognitively transparent, and efficiently exploitable in several applications.
* DBpedia, a database of structured information, is linked to WordNet.
* The eXtended WordNet is a project at the University of Texas at Dallas which aims to improve WordNet by semantically parsing the glosses, thus making the information contained in these definitions available for automatic knowledge processing systems. It is freely available under a license similar to WordNet&#x27;s.
* The GCIDE project produced a dictionary by combining a public domain &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; from 1913 with some WordNet definitions and material provided by volunteers. It was released under the copyleft license GPL.
* ImageNet is an image database organized according to the WordNet hierarchy (currently only the nouns), in which each node of the hierarchy is depicted by millions of images. Currently, it has over 500 images per node on average.
* BioWordnet, a biomedical extension of wordnet was abandoned due to issues about stability over versions.
* WikiTax2WordNet, a mapping between WordNet synsets and .
* WordNet++, a resource including over millions of semantic edges harvested from Wikipedia and connecting pairs of WordNet synsets.
* SentiWordNet, a resource for supporting opinion mining applications obtained by tagging all the WordNet 3.0 synsets according to their estimated degrees of positivity, negativity, and neutrality.
* ColorDict, is an Android application to mobiles phones that use Wordnet database and others, like Wikipedia.
* UBY-LMF a database of 10 resources including WordNet.

=== Related projects ===
* FrameNet is a lexical database that shares some similarities with, and refers to, WordNet. 
* Lexical markup framework (LMF) is an ISO standard specified within ISO/TC37 in order to define a common standardized framework for the construction of lexicons, including WordNet. The subset of LMF for Wordnet is called Wordnet-LMF. An instantiation has been made within the KYOTO project.
* UNL Programme is a project under the auspices of UNO aimed to consolidate lexicosemantic data of many languages to be used in machine translation and information extraction systems.
* Meaning Monkey is a free online dictionary based on the WordNet database.

<text>The Whippet is a British breed of medium-sized dog of the sighthound type, related to the larger Greyhound and the smaller Italian Greyhound. Aside from size differences, the Whippet closely resembles these two breeds and is sometimes referred to as the &quot;miniature Greyhound&quot; or, colloquially, as &quot;the poor man&#x27;s racehorse.&quot; The breed is commonly kept as a companion dog, for competitive showing, and for amateur racing. Additionally, Whippets participate in various dog sports, including lure coursing, agility, and flyball. Known for its remarkable speed, the Whippet holds the title for the fastest running speed within its weight and size range, and is believed to have the fastest idle-to-running acceleration of any dog. 

Whippets are characterized by their gentle, affectionate, and calm temperament. While typically relaxed and serene at home, they exhibit high energy and excitement when outdoors. Originally bred as hunting and racing dogs, Whippets have a strong prey drive, which may lead them to chase small animals. Therefore, supervision during outdoor activities is recommended.

Whippets have a minimal-shedding coat that is easy to manage due to its short, smooth texture and lack of an undercoat. However, their short coat and low body fat make them particularly sensitive to cold temperatures, so they may require extra protection, such as a dog jacket, in cooler weather. The breed is generally healthy, benefiting from a strong, athletic constitution, and is free from many hereditary issues seen in other breeds.

The concept of greyhound-type dogs of various sizes—large, medium, and small—has been well-documented in hunting manuals and natural history works dating back to the Middle Ages. In the early 15th century, Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York, translated and expanded the late 14th-century French &quot;Livre de chasse&quot;, a comprehensive manual on instructions for hunting with dogs. In his work, he highlighted the benefits of keeping ‘great,’ ‘middle,’ and ‘small-sized Greyhounds’ for hunting different kinds of game. Later, in the 16th century, English physician and academic John Caius referenced both greater and lesser types of &quot;Leporarius, Grehounde&quot; (Greyhound) in his book &quot;De Canibus Britannicis&quot;. Notably, he described a type connected to the Whippet: the tumbler, a &#x27;lesser sort of mungrell greyhounde&#x27; that was an excellent warren dog used for catching rabbits. The tumbler was also recorded by Thomas Brown, a Scottish curator and editor, in the early 19th century. 

== Name ==
The name &quot;Whippet&quot; is derived from an early seventeenth-century term, now obsolete, meaning &quot;to move briskly.&quot; 

In the Victorian era, English writers began describing an emerging modern breed of Whippet, also known as the &quot;snap-dog,&quot; a term derived from their tendency to readily &#x27;snap up&#x27; nearby prey due to their naturally high prey drive. This breed was primarily developed for catching rabbits, coursing competitions, straight racing, and the growing trend of show fancy.

== History ==
Whippets, like all sighthounds, were bred to hunt using their sight-driven prey instinct, coursing game in open areas at high speeds. Numerous representations of small, sighthound-like hunting dogs can be found in Ancient Egyptian artworks dating back thousands of years, possibly depicting ancient forms of the Greyhound, Basenji, Pharaoh Hound, or Saluki. In medieval England, a small greyhound-type breed became popular as a ratting dog. The first written use of the word &#x27;whippet&#x27; in English, referring to a type of dog, was in 1610. In a painting by Jean-Baptiste Oudry (1686–1755) of two dogs named ‘Misse’ and ‘Turlu’, presented to Louis XV of France, the dogs depicted were either Whippets or another small, smooth-coated sighthound, but they were likely an early form of the Whippet. Oudry also completed a second painting of Misse with a different, non-sighthound breed of dog. A 1758 painting by Pompeo Batoni, &quot;Portrait of Charles Compton, 7th Earl of Northampton&quot;, also features a similar, whippet-like dog.

In the 19th century, Whippet racing was a popular sport in parts of England. The breed was highly regarded in the northern parts of England, as well as in Wales, but was generally disregarded in the rest of the country. At the time, there were two varieties of Whippet: one type had a smoother coat and was more popular in Lancashire, Yorkshire, and the Midlands, later becoming the modern Whippet. The second form had a rougher coat due to crossbreeding with Bedlington Terriers. This type was more popular in Durham and Northumberland, and was frequently referred to as a &#x27;rabbit dog&#x27;. Early specimens were taken from the racetrack by dog fanciers of the time and later exported around the world. John Taylor, an English writer, noted that &quot;In all the shapes and forms of dogges; of all which there are but two sorts that are useful to man&#x27;s profits, which two are the mastiffe and the little curre, whippet, or house-dogge; all the rest are for pleasure and recreation.&quot;

The modern Whippet seemingly came into its own in 1891 when The Kennel Club officially recognized the breed. This recognition allowed Whippets to compete in dog shows and have their pedigrees recorded. In the United States, the Whippet was recognized three years earlier, in 1888, by the American Kennel Club (AKC). The breed arrived in the U.S. from England, brought by mill operators, with the first populations established in Massachusetts. According to the AKC ranking, the Whippet has consistently ranked within the top 60 breeds over the past decade, with a ranking of 51st place in 2023.

In 1964, the Whippet Ch. Courtenay Fleetfoot of Pennyworth won Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. Later, in 1992, Pencloe Dutch Gold won best in show at Crufts, followed by Cobyco Call the Tune in 2004 and Ch. Collooney Tartan Tease in 2018. In 2011, the female Whippet GCh. Starline&#x27;s Chanel was named Hound Group Show Dog of the Year by the Westminster Kennel Club.

== Description ==
=== Appearance ===

The Whippet is a medium-sized dog with a sleek, aerodynamic body typical of sighthounds, adapted for speed and agility. It has a deep chest for efficient lung capacity, long, slender legs, and a narrow, muscular build characteristic of breeds developed for running. The ideal height for bitches is , and for dogs . The standards of the American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club allow for larger animals, with an upper limit of for bitches and for dogs. Because colour is considered immaterial in judging Whippets, they come in a wide variety of colours and marking patterns, ranging from solid black to solid white, with red, fawn, brindle, blue, or cream. In 2019, The Kennel Club announced that it would no longer accept registrations for merle Whippets, as it is not a naturally occurring colour in the breed.

The coat is short, smooth, and close-fitting, contributing to the breed&#x27;s streamlined appearance. Due to their short coat and low body fat, Whippets are not well-insulated against cold temperatures. While they are well-suited for indoor living due to their minimal grooming needs and low shedding, they may require additional protection, such as a coat or sweater, when exposed to cold weather.

=== Temperament ===

Whippets are quiet and reserved, but they also exhibit a playful side and require regular exercise to maintain their physical and mental health. They are generally gentle dogs and are often content to spend much of the day relaxing. The American Kennel Club (AKC) describes them as &quot;quiet and dignified in their owner&#x27;s living room&quot; and says they make &quot;excellent house dogs.&quot; Despite their calm nature indoors, they enjoy outdoor activities, especially short bursts of explosive running that allow them to reach high speeds. These brief, intense sprints are followed by long periods of rest, reflecting their energetic profile and need for recovery. They have been called a &quot;poor man&#x27;s racehorse&quot; by the colliers in Lancashire and Yorkshire.

The Whippet will form a strong bond and devotion to its owner and, as such, can often suffer from separation anxiety, like many other breeds when left alone. Though not prone to excessive barking, Whippets will occasionally vocalize in the presence of intruders, making them passable watchdogs, similar to other small-to-medium dogs. However, a Whippet is unlikely to attack or guard against anyone due to their gentle and often shy demeanor, preferring to retreat rather than confront danger. While their gentle demeanor makes them a good choice for households with children or other pets, it is important to note that Whippets possess a highly developed prey drive. This instinct, though manageable with proper training and socialization, can make them prone to chasing small animals, such as cats, rabbits, or squirrels, especially in uncontrolled environments. Owners should take care during walks or when allowing them off-leash in unenclosed areas.

=== Speed and gait ===

Whippets are known as the fastest dogs of their weight class, capable of achieving speeds of up to , due to their ability to run in a double suspension gallop. This distinctive gait, in which all four legs are off the ground twice during each stride—once when fully extended and again when tucked under the body—allows for maximum speed and efficiency. Combined with their muscular build, this running style enhances their agility and athleticism, making them highly skilled competitors in racing and field trials.

== Health ==

The Whippet is a generally healthy breed, with a robust constitution. Having been bred for coursing, working, and racing for many years, it has maintained a structurally sound build. This long history of selective breeding has helped it avoid many of the physical exaggerations that often lead to health issues in other breeds. As a result, the Whippet is typically free from the common hereditary conditions found in more exaggerated dog types, making it a relatively low-maintenance breed in terms of health. 

The Whippet, like other sighthounds, is intolerant of barbiturate anaesthetics. This is partly due to its low body fat concentration, which affects its ability to metabolize these anaesthetics. Additionally, the Whippet’s liver is not well-equipped to process barbiturates, making it more susceptible to adverse reactions during anaesthesia.

A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13.4 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 years for purebreeds and 12 years for crossbreeds. They are generally healthy, and are not prone to the frequent ear infections, skin allergies, or digestive problems that can afflict other breeds. Genetic eye defects, though quite rare, have been noted in the breed. Because of this, the American Whippet Club recommends that breeders test for this defect in their breeding stock. Hip dysplasia is rare in Whippets, with only 1.2% of 161 evaluations performed by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals being determined as dysplastic.

The Whippet&#x27;s heart is notably large and slow-beating, often exhibiting arrhythmic or even intermittent patterns when the dog is at rest. This trait can occasionally alarm owners or veterinarians unfamiliar with the breed. During exercise, however, the Whippet&#x27;s heart demonstrates a regular and efficient rhythm, supporting its exceptional athletic abilities. A health survey conducted by The Kennel Club revealed that cardiac issues are the second leading cause of mortality in the breed, highlighting the importance of regular veterinary check-ups to monitor heart health. Heart failure is particularly common among Whippets in their senior years, with mitral valve disease (MVD) being one of the most prevalent heart conditions affecting the breed. MVD involves the weakening and deformation of the mitral valve, preventing it from closing tightly, which leads to mitral regurgitation (MR) and increased strain on the heart. While many Whippets exhibit heart murmurs, distinguishing functional murmurs from those associated with MR can be challenging, as functional murmurs often occur in healthy, athletic dogs. The study indicated that additional evaluation methods, such as echocardiography, are necessary to differentiate between functional murmurs and murmurs indicative of MVD in this population.

A 2007 study identified a myostatin mutation specific to the Whippet that is strongly associated with its athletic performance. Whippets with a single copy of this mutation are generally unaffected, while those with two copies develop disproportionately large musculature and are referred to as &quot;Bully Whippets&quot;. Despite their unusual appearance, bully Whippets experience no significant health issues beyond those typical of the breed, although they may be slightly more prone to muscle cramping. Interestingly, this mutation has not been observed in Greyhounds, other sighthound breeds, or heavily muscled dogs such as Bulldogs, Rottweilers, or American Staffordshire Terriers.

==Racing==

Dog racing was originally an extension of hare coursing. Whippets began to be bred to race in the mid-nineteenth century and became popular for racing. The first form of the sport was a rudimentary version of coursing known as &#x27;ragging&#x27;, and dogs who participated were said to be &#x27;trained to the rag&#x27;. Dogs were kept on a leash by a person known as a &quot;slip&quot;, who was often also the race judge. The slip would release the dogs from their collars at the same time, and they would race towards their owners, who were standing at the opposite end of the track waving towels to encourage the dogs to run toward them.

Whippet rags were a popular Sunday event in the north and Midlands at the time. There were also international events; in Australia, at a track known as Gurney&#x27;s Paddock, races with more than 300 Whippets were held every Saturday, and three nights a week at the White City track. Eventually, the sport evolved, and dogs were divided into four groups: those who hunted rabbits, which was not governed by rules; those who coursed hares, for which a set of rules was established; those trained to the rag; and those trained to chase a mechanical lure in a fashion similar to Greyhound races. Few of the Whippets in any of the four groups were purebred, as maintaining a purebred bloodline was not considered as important as breeding dogs that could win races. Many racing dogs were part-terrier, part-Greyhound, or part-Lurcher.

In 1967, the &quot;British Whippet Racing Association&quot; was established to introduce reforms and standardize race rules and procedures for races involving non-purebred Whippets. A year later, viewing the non-purebred dogs as a threat, the &quot;Whippet Club Racing Association&quot; was established to regulate racing exclusively for purebred Whippets.

<text>The Palace of Culture and Science (; abbreviated PKiN) is a notable high-rise building in central Warsaw, Poland. With a total height of , it is the second tallest building in both Warsaw and Poland (after the Varso Tower), the sixth tallest building in the European Union and one of the tallest on the European continent. At the time of its completion in 1955, the Palace was the eighth tallest building in the world, retaining the position until 1961; it was also briefly the tallest clock tower in the world, from 2000 until the 2002 installation of a clock mechanism on the NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building in Tokyo, Japan.

Motivated by Polish historical architecture and American art deco high-rise buildings, the Palace of Culture and Science was designed by Soviet-Russian architect Lev Rudnev in &quot;Seven Sisters&quot; style.

The Palace houses various public and cultural institutions such as theatres, cinemas, libraries, university faculties and authorities of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Surrounding the building are a collection of sculptures representing figures of the fields of culture and science, with the main entrance featuring sculptures of Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, by Ludwika Nitschowa, and Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, by Stanisław Horno-Popławski. Since 2007, the PKiN has been enlisted in the Registry of Objects of Cultural Heritage.

==Name==
The building was originally known as the Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Palace of Culture and Science (&quot;Pałac Kultury i Nauki imienia Józefa Stalina&quot;), but in the wake of destalinization the dedication to Stalin was revoked. Stalin&#x27;s name was removed from the colonnade, interior lobby and one of the building&#x27;s sculptures.

A number of nicknames have been used to refer to the palace, notably &quot;Pekin&quot; (&quot;Beijing&quot;, because of its abbreviated name &quot;PKiN&quot;), &quot;Pajac&quot; (&quot;clown&quot;, a word that sounds close to &quot;Pałac&quot;), and the &quot;Drunk Confectioner&#x27;s Nightmarish Dream&quot; (&quot;koszmarny sen pijanego cukiernika&quot;), attributed to poet Władysław Broniewski. Other nicknames include the &quot;Syringe&quot; (&quot;strzykawka&quot;), the &quot;Elephant in Lacy Underwear&quot; (&quot;słoń w koronowych gatkach&quot;), the &quot;Russian Wedding Cake&quot; (&quot;ruski tort&quot;) and &quot;Stalin&#x27;s rocket&quot; (&quot;rakieta Stalina&quot;), as well as more pejorative appelations like &quot;Stalin&#x27;s dick&quot; (&quot;chuj Stalina&quot;).

==History==
===Construction===
An agreement on the construction of the building was signed between the governments of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic and the Soviet Union on 5 April 1952. The tower was delivered as a gift to the people of Poland. It was named after Joseph Stalin upon its completion in 1955.

To decide on the height of the building, Soviet and Polish architects gathered in the area of the Śląsko-Dąbrowski Bridge on the east bank of the Vistula river. Over the axis of the future skyscraper flew a small plane pulling a balloon behind it. The group standing near the bridge had radio contact with the pilot of the plane. Initially, the balloon flew at an altitude of , then higher at . The Soviets, led by Lev Rudnev, decided that was enough for the highest point of the city. The Poles, led by the plenipotentiary for the construction of the building and chief architect of Warsaw, Józef Sigalin, began to shout &quot;Higher!&quot; after every of balloon height increase. Finally, the tower was set at a height of , with a main structure, a turret and a spire.

Construction started in May 1952 and lasted until July 1955. The tower was built by Soviet plans, using 3,500 to 5,000 Soviet workers and 4,000 Polish workers. 16 workers died in accidents during the construction. The builders were housed at a new suburban complex built at Poland&#x27;s expense, with its own cinema, food court, community centre and swimming pool, called Osiedle &quot;Przyjaźni&quot; (Neighborhood of Friendship).

The architecture of the building is closely related to several similar skyscrapers built either in the Soviet Union or in Eastern Bloc countries, most notably the main building of Moscow State University, the House of the Free Press in Bucharest, and the Latvian Academy of Sciences Building in Riga. However, the main architect Lev Rudnev incorporated some Polish architectural details into the project after travelling around Poland and seeing its architecture. The monumental walls are headed with pieces of masonry copied from Renaissance houses and palaces of Kraków and Zamość.

===Early years===

At the time of its completion, the Palace of Culture and Science was the eighth tallest building in the world and the second tallest building in Europe (after the Moscow State University Building). The Palace retained these positions until 1961 and 1990, respectively.

Shortly after opening, many visiting dignitaries toured the Palace, and the building hosted the 5th World Festival of Youth and Students, held from July to August 1955. In 1956, a series of suicidal jumps began from the observation deck on the 30th floor, at a height of . Initially a Frenchman jumped, followed by seven Poles. After the incidents, bars were put on the terrace of the tower.

The Palace hosted performances by notable international artists, such as a 1967 concert by The Rolling Stones, the first by a major western rock group behind the Iron Curtain. In 1985, it hosted the historic Leonard Cohen concert, surrounded by many political expectations, which were avoided by Cohen in his prolonged introductions during the three-hour show.

===Present day===
The building currently serves as an exhibition centre and office complex. The Palace contains a multiplex cinema with eight screens (Kinoteka), four theatres (Studio, Dramatyczny, Lalka and 6. piętro), two museums (Museum of Evolution and Museum of Technology), offices, bookshops, a large swimming pool, an auditorium hall for 3,000 people called Congress Hall, and an accredited university, Collegium Civitas, on the 11th and 12th floors of the building. The terrace on the 30th floor, at , is a well-known tourist attraction with a panoramic view of the city. The Warsaw City Council and city offices are located in the building.

A collection of sculptures representing figures of the fields of culture and science surrounds the Palace. Two of them are located in front of the main entrance: one of Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, by Ludwika Nitschowa, and another of Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, by Stanisław Horno-Popławski.

Four clock faces were added to the top of the building ahead of the millennium celebrations in 2000. The clocks began working on 31 December 2000.

The Congress Hall held the finals of Miss World 2006.

In 2010, the illumination of the building was modernized and high-power LED lights were installed, allowing the Palace to take various colours at night. The first use of the new lighting was during Christmas in 2010, when the Palace was illuminated in green and white to resemble a Christmas tree. In December 2013, during the Euromaidan protests, it was illuminated in blue and yellow, the colours of the Ukrainian national flag as a sign of solidarity with the protesters. On 29 January 2021, during the Women&#x27;s Strike protests, the symbol of the movement—a single red bolt on a black background—was projected on the building.

==RTCN Warszawa (PKiN) transmitter==

The Palace, being for many years the tallest building in the city, had a broadcast antenna installed in 1956 to enable television transmissions, which is now officially known as Radiowo-Telewizyjne Centrum Nadawcze Warszawa (PKiN) [RTCN Warszawa (PKiN)]. In 1974, a microwave link was erected to enable RTCN Warszawa (PKiN) to send Polskie Radio Program I programming to the longwave Warsaw radio mast at Konstantynów, which was removed in 2004, 13 years after the collapse of the Konstantynów radio mast. FM radio transmissions began from the PKiN transmitter in 1992.

Digital television transmissions from RTCN Warszawa (PKiN) began on 22 July 2008, using the DVB-T standard. Nowadays, six digital multiplexes of all the country&#x27;s free-to-air broadcasters are transmitted from the Palace.

Analogue television transmissions, which used the Eastern Bloc SECAM standard until 1994 when the country changed over to PAL, were shut down from RTCN Warszawa (PKiN) on 19 March 2013. Notably, Soviet Central Television Programme One (later Channel One Russia) was rebroadcast from the PKiN transmitter from 1 April 1987 until 31 May 1997, for Soviet Armed Forces (later Russian Armed Forces) personnel stationed in the country until 1993.

==Fauna==
The 42nd floor of the Palace is a nesting place for peregrine falcons. In 2009, cameras were installed at the site, with a live view from the nest being available on the website of the Association for Wild Animals Sokół. In 2016, after a five-year break, a pair of falcons had offspring there. In a competition of internet users, the young falcons were given the names Bazyl, Orion and Wawa. In 2017, due to the maintenance works on the spire of the building, the falcons were moved to the highest floor of the Warsaw Trade Tower skyscraper. They returned to the Palace of Culture and Science after the renovation of the spire was completed.

Cats live on the second basement floor, with the administration of the Palace of Culture and Science responsible for their care. In the past, there were several dozen of them, while in June 2015 the number of these animals was 11.

Since 2015, an apiary is kept on the roof of the Studio Theatre at the Palace of Culture and Science.

==Controversy==
The Palace of Culture and Science is highly controversial. It is often viewed as a reminder of Soviet influence over the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, especially due to its construction during mass violations of human rights at the behest of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. &quot;Porozumienie Organizacji Kombatanckich i Niepodległościowych w Krakowie&quot;, a coalition of veteran and nationalist groups, as well as Law and Justice (PiS) have called for its demolition. In 2009, then Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski supported the demolition of the Palace noting the expense involved in its maintenance. Other prominent government leaders have continued to endorse demolition plans, including former Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.

<doc id="33958" wikidata="Q630380" url="?curid=33958" title="Wake-on-LAN">
<text>Wake-on-LAN (WoL or WOL) is an Ethernet or Token Ring computer networking standard that allows a computer to be turned on or awakened from sleep mode by a network message.
The message is usually sent to the target computer by a program executed on a device connected to the same local area network (LAN). It is also possible to initiate the message from another network by using subnet directed broadcasts or a WoL gateway service.
It is based upon AMD&#x27;s &quot;Magic Packet Technology&quot;, which was co-developed by AMD and Hewlett-Packard, following its proposal as a standard in 1995. The standard saw quick adoption thereafter through IBM, Intel and others.
If the computer being awakened is communicating via Wi-Fi, a supplementary standard called Wake on Wireless LAN (WoWLAN) must be employed.
The WoL and WoWLAN standards are often supplemented by vendors to provide protocol-transparent on-demand services, for example in the Apple Bonjour wake-on-demand (Sleep Proxy) feature.

==History==
The basis for the &quot;Wake-on-LAN&quot;-industry standard mechanism today, was created around 1994 by AMD in cooperation with Hewlett-Packard, who co-developed AMD&#x27;s &quot;Magic Packet Technology&quot; and brought forth their following proposal for it in November 1995 in an AMD whitepaper. It enabled a remote network device to be woken up through the underlying “power management circuitry”, by sending it a standard Ethernet frame, which “contains a specific data pattern detected by the Ethernet-controller on the receiving end”.

AMD implemented the WoL mechanism in their &quot;AMD PCnet II&quot;-Family of Ethernet controllers before. The term &quot;“Magic Packet”&quot; is a AMD trademark.

Wake-on-LAN saw wide adoption starting in October 1996, when IBM formed the &quot;Advanced Manageability Alliance&quot; (AMA) with Intel. In April 1997, this alliance adopted the Wake-on-LAN technology.

Contrary to most networking protocols, no formal Request for Comments (RFC) documents have been created for Wake-on-LAN, but nevertheless it remains a standard that is widely used in the industry.

==Principle of operation==
Ethernet connections, including home and work networks, wireless data networks, and the Internet itself, are based on frames sent between computers. WoL is implemented using a specially designed frame called a magic packet, which is commonly sent to all computers in a network, among them the computer to be awakened. The magic packet contains the MAC address of the destination computer. This is an identifying number, built into each network interface controller (NIC), that enables the NIC to be uniquely recognized and addressed on a network. In computers capable of Wake-on-LAN, the NIC(s) &quot;listen&quot; to incoming packets, even when the rest of the system is powered down. If a magic packet arrives and is addressed to the device&#x27;s MAC address, the NIC signals the computer&#x27;s power supply or motherboard to awaken. This has the same effect as pressing the power button.

The magic packet is broadcast on the data link layer to all attached devices on a given network, using the network broadcast address; the IP address (which relates to the internet layer) is not used. Because Wake-on-LAN is built upon broadcast messaging, it can generally only be used within a subnet. Wake-on-LAN can, however, operate across any network in practice, given appropriate configuration and hardware, including remote wake-up across the Internet.

In order for Wake-on-LAN to work, parts of the network interface need to stay on. This consumes a small amount of standby power. To further reduce power consumption, the link speed is usually reduced to the lowest possible speed (e.g. a Gigabit Ethernet NIC maintains only a 10 Mbit/s link). Disabling Wake-on-LAN, when not needed, can slightly reduce power consumption on computers that are switched off but still plugged into a power socket. The power drain becomes a consideration on battery-powered devices such as laptops as this can deplete the battery even when the device is completely shut down.

===Magic packet===
The &quot;magic packet&quot; is a frame that is most often sent as a broadcast and that contains anywhere within its payload 6 bytes of all 255 (FF FF FF FF FF FF in hexadecimal), followed by sixteen repetitions of the target computer&#x27;s 48-bit MAC address, for a total of 102 bytes.

Since the magic packet is only scanned for the string above, and not actually parsed by a full protocol stack, it could be sent as payload of any network- and transport-layer protocol, although it is typically sent as a UDP datagram to port 0 (reserved port number), 7 (Echo Protocol) or 9 (Discard Protocol), or directly over Ethernet using EtherType 0x0842. A connection-oriented transport-layer protocol like TCP is less suited for this task as it requires establishing an active connection before sending user data.

A standard magic packet has the following basic limitations:
* Requires destination computer MAC address (also may require a &quot;SecureOn&quot; password)
* Does not provide a delivery confirmation
* May not work outside of the local area network
* Requires hardware support for Wake-on-LAN in the destination computer
* Most 802.11 wireless interfaces do not maintain a link in low-power states and cannot receive a magic packet

The Wake-on-LAN implementation is designed to be simple and to be quickly processed by the circuitry present on the network interface controller using minimal power. Because Wake-on-LAN operates below the IP protocol layer, IP addresses and DNS names are meaningless and so the MAC address is required.

===Subnet directed broadcasts===
A principal limitation of standard broadcast Wake-on-LAN is that broadcast packets are generally not routed. This prevents the technique being used in larger networks or over the Internet. Subnet-directed broadcasts (SDBs) may be used to overcome this limitation. SDB may require changes to the intermediate router configuration. SDBs are treated like unicast network packets until processed by the final (local) router. This router then broadcasts the packet using a layer-2 broadcast. This technique allows a broadcast to be initiated on a remote network but requires all intervening routers to forward the SDB. When preparing a network to forward SDB packets, care must be taken to filter packets so that only desired (e.g. WoL) SDB packets are permittedotherwise the network may become a participant in DDoS attacks such as the Smurf attack.

===Troubleshooting magic packets===
Wake-on-LAN can be a difficult technology to implement because it requires appropriate BIOS/UEFI, network interface hardware and, sometimes, operating system and router support to function reliably. In some cases, hardware may wake from one low-power state but not from others. This means that due to hardware issues the computer may be wakeable from its soft off state (S5) but doesn&#x27;t wake from sleep or hibernation or vice versa.

==Security considerations==

===Unauthorized access===
Magic packets are sent via the data link or OSI-2 layer, which can be used or abused by anyone on the same LAN, unless the L2 LAN equipment is capable of and configured for filtering such traffic to match site-wide security requirements.

Firewalls may be used to prevent clients among the public WAN from accessing the broadcast addresses of inside LAN segments, or routers may be configured to ignore subnet-directed broadcasts.

Certain NICs support a security feature called &quot;SecureOn&quot;. It allows users to store within the NIC a hexadecimal password of 6 bytes. Clients append this password to the magic packet. The NIC wakes the system only if the MAC address and password are correct. This security measure significantly decreases the risk of successful brute force attacks, by increasing the search space by 48 bits (6 bytes), up to 296 combinations if the MAC address is entirely unknown. However, any network eavesdropping will expose the cleartext password.

Abuse of the Wake-on-LAN feature only allows computers to be switched on; it does not in itself bypass password and other forms of security, and is unable to power off the machine once on. However, many client computers attempt booting from a PXE server when powered up by WoL. Therefore, a combination of DHCP and PXE servers on the network can sometimes be used to start a computer with an attacker&#x27;s boot image, bypassing any security of the installed operating system and granting access to unprotected, local disks over the network.

===Interactions with network access control===
The use of Wake-on-LAN technology on enterprise networks can sometimes conflict with network access control solutions such as 802.1X MAC-based authentication, which may prevent magic packet delivery if a machine&#x27;s WoL hardware has not been designed to maintain a live authentication session while in a sleep state.

===Security===
Some PCs include technology built into the chipset to improve security for Wake-on-LAN. For example, Intel AMT (a component of Intel vPro technology). AMT uses TLS encryption to secure an out-of-band communication tunnel to an AMT-based PC for remote management commands such as Wake-on-LAN.

AMT secures the communication tunnel with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 128-bit encryption and RSA keys with modulus lengths of 2,048 bits. Because the encrypted communication is out-of-band, the PC&#x27;s hardware and firmware receive the magic packet before network traffic reaches the software stack for the operating system (OS). Since the encrypted communication occurs &quot;below&quot; the OS level, it is less vulnerable to attacks by viruses, worms, and other threats that typically target the OS level.

IT shops using Wake-on-LAN through the Intel AMT implementation can wake an AMT PC over network environments that require TLS-based security, such as IEEE 802.1X, Cisco Self Defending Network (SDN), and Microsoft Network Access Protection (NAP) environments. The Intel implementation also works for wireless networks.

==Hardware requirements==
Wake-on-LAN support is implemented on the motherboard of a computer and in the network interface controller. It is consequently not dependent on the operating system running on the computer. In order to get Wake-on-LAN to work, enabling this feature on the network interface card or on-board silicon is sometimes required. Details of how to do this depend upon the operating system and the device driver.

Wake-on-LAN usually needs to be enabled in the Power Management section of a PC motherboard&#x27;s BIOS/UEFI setup utility, although on some systems, such as Apple computers, it is enabled by default. On older systems the BIOS/UEFI setting may be referred to as WoL; on newer systems supporting PCI version 2.2, it may be referred to as PME (Power Management Events, which include WoL). It may also be necessary to configure the computer to reserve standby power for the network card when the system is shut down.

With older motherboards, if the network interface is a plug-in card rather than being integrated into the motherboard there may be a header onboard connected to the network card via a special three-pin cable the card. Systems supporting the PCI 2.2 standard and with a PCI 2.2 compliant network adapter card do not usually require a cable as the required standby power is relayed through the PCI bus. The power supply must meet ATX 2.01 specifications.

Laptops powered by the Intel Centrino processor technology or newer (with explicit BIOS/UEFI support) allow waking up the machine using Wake on Wireless LAN (WoWLAN).

In most modern PCs, ACPI is notified of the &quot;waking up&quot; and takes control of the power-up. In ACPI, OSPM must record the &quot;wake source&quot; or the device that is causing the power-upthe device being the &quot;soft&quot; power switch, the NIC (via Wake-on-LAN), the cover being opened, a temperature change, etc.

The three-pin WoL interface on the motherboard consists of: pin 1, +5V DC (red); pin 2, ground (black); pin 3, wake signal (green or yellow). By supplying the pin-3 wake signal with +5V DC the computer will be triggered to power up provided WoL is enabled in the BIOS/UEFI configuration.

==Software requirements==

Software that sends a WoL magic packet is referred to in different circles as &quot;client&quot; or &quot;server&quot;, which can be a source of confusion. While WoL hardware or firmware is arguably performing the role of a &quot;server&quot;, Web-based interfaces that act as a gateway through which users can issue WoL packets without downloading a local client often become known as &quot;The Wake On LAN Server&quot; to users. Additionally, software that administers WoL capabilities from the host OS side may be carelessly referred to as a &quot;client&quot; on occasion; Machines running WoL generally tend to be end-user desktops, and as such, are &quot;clients&quot; in IT parlance.

===Creating and sending the magic packet===
Software to send WoL magic packets is available for all modern platforms, including Windows, Macintosh and Linux, plus many smartphones. Examples include: Wake On LAN GUI, LAN Helper, Magic Packet Utility, NetWaker for Windows, Nirsoft WakeMeOnLAN, WakeOnLANx, EMCO WOL, Aquila Tech Wake on LAN, ManageEngine WOL utility, FusionFenix and SolarWinds WOL Tool.

===Ensuring the magic packet travels from source to destination===
If the sender is on the same subnet or local area network as the computer to be awakened there are generally no issues. When sending over the Internet, and in particular where a network address translation (NAT) router is involved (as typically in most homes), special settings are often necessary.

Further, the WoL protocol operates on a deeper level in the multi-layer networking architecture. To ensure the magic packet gets from source to destination while the destination is sleeping, the ARP binding must typically be set in a NAT router. This allows the router to forward the magic packet to the sleeping computer at a networking layer below typical IP usage. There are some security implications associated with ARP binding (see ARP spoofing); however, as long as none of the computers connected to the LAN are compromised, an attacker must use a computer that is connected directly to the target LAN (plugged into the LAN via cable, or by breaking through the Wi‑Fi connection security) to gain access to the LAN.

Most home routers are able to send magic packets to a LAN; for example, routers with the DD-WRT, Tomato or PfSense firmware have a built-in Wake-on-LAN client.

===Responding to the magic packet===

Most WoL hardware functionally is typically blocked by default and needs to be enabled using the system BIOS/UEFI setup. Further configuration from the OS is required in some cases, for example via the Device Manager network card properties on Windows operating systems.

====Microsoft Windows====

Newer versions of Microsoft Windows integrate WoL functionality into the Device Manager. This is available in the power management tab of each network device&#x27;s driver properties. For full support of a device&#x27;s WoL capabilities (such as the ability to wake from an ACPI S5 power-off state), installation of the full driver suite from the network device manufacturer may be necessary, rather than the bare driver provided by Microsoft or the computer manufacturer. In most cases correct BIOS/UEFI configuration is also required for WoL to function.

The ability to wake from a hybrid shutdown state (in which all user sessions are terminated and the system then enters S4 state) (aka Fast Startup, introduced in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012) or a soft powered-off state (in which all user sessions are terminated and the system then enters S5 state) is not officially supported in Windows. This is because of a change in the OS behavior which causes network adapters to be explicitly not armed for WoL when shutdown to these states occurs, so that those adapters don&#x27;t consume power in what appears to the user to be a shutdown state, even though the system is just hibernating in a &quot;hybrid shutdown&quot; state. WOL from a non-hybrid hibernation state (in which the system enters S4 state without terminating user sessions) (i.e. when a user explicitly requests hibernation) or a sleep state (S3) is supported. However, some hardware will enable WoL from states that are unsupported by Windows.

====Mac hardware (macOS)====

Modern Mac hardware supports WoL functionality when the computer is in a sleep state, but it is not possible to wake up a Mac computer from a powered-off state.

Mac OS X Snow Leopard and later support WoL, which is called Wake on Demand. On laptops, the feature is controlled via the macOS System Settings Battery panel, in the Options pop-up window. The &quot;Wake for network access&quot; item can be set to &quot;Always&quot;, &quot;Only on Power Adapter&quot;, or &quot;Never&quot;; &quot;Always&quot; enables Wake-on-LAN even when on battery power, but &quot;Only on Power Adapter&quot; enables it only when connected to a power supply. On desktops, the feature is controlled via the System Settings Energy Saver panel. Marking the &quot;Wake for network access&quot; checkbox enables Wake-on-LAN. It can also be configured through the terminal using the &quot;pmset womp&quot; (wake on magic packet) command.
Apple&#x27;s Apple Remote Desktop client management system can be used to send Wake-on-LAN packets, but there are also freeware and shareware macOS applications available. A mechanism called Bonjour Sleep Proxy, provided by Apple AirPort access points and Apple TVs, allows other machines on a LAN to cause a WoL packet to be sent to a host when that machine accesses one of the host&#x27;s shared resources.

====Linux====

Wake-on-LAN support may be changed using a subfunction of the ethtool command, for example:
ethtool -s eth0 wol g
==Other machine states and LAN wakeup signals==
In the early days of Wake-on-LAN the situation was relatively simple: a machine was connected to power but switched off, and it was arranged that a special packet be sent to switch the machine on.

Since then many options have been added and standards agreed upon. A machine can be in seven power states from S0 (fully on) through S5 (powered down but plugged in) and disconnected from power (G3, Mechanical Off), with names such as &quot;sleep&quot;, &quot;standby&quot;, and &quot;hibernate&quot;. In some reduced-power modes the system state is stored in RAM and the machine can wake up very quickly; in others the state is saved to disk and the motherboard powered down, taking at least several seconds to wake up. The machine can be awakened from a reduced-power state by a variety of signals.

The machine&#x27;s BIOS/UEFI must be set to allow Wake-on-LAN. To allow wakeup from powered-down state S5, wakeup on PME (Power Management Event) is also required. The Intel adapter allows &quot;Wake on Directed Packet&quot;, &quot;Wake on Magic Packet&quot;, &quot;Wake on Magic Packet from power off state&quot;, and &quot;Wake on Link&quot;. Wake on Directed Packet is particularly useful as the machine will automatically come out of standby or hibernation when it is referenced, without the user or application needing to explicitly send a magic packet. Unfortunately in many networks waking on directed packet (any packet with the adapter&#x27;s MAC address or IP address) or on link is likely to cause wakeup immediately after going to a low-power state. Details for any particular motherboard and network adapter are to be found in the relevant manuals; there is no general method. Knowledge of signals on the network may also be needed to prevent spurious wakening.

===Waking up without operator presence===

If a machine that is not designed to support Wake-on-LAN is left powered down after power failure, it may be possible to set the BIOS/UEFI to start it up automatically on restoration of power, so that it is never left in an unresponsive state. A typical BIOS/UEFI setting is &quot;AC back function&quot; which may be &quot;on&quot;, &quot;off&quot;, or &quot;memory&quot;. &quot;On&quot; is the correct setting in this case; &quot;memory&quot;, which restores the machine to the state it was in when power was lost, may leave a machine which was hibernating in an unwakeable state.

Other problems can affect the ability to start or control the machine remotely: hardware failure of the machine or network, failure of the BIOS/UEFI settings battery (the machine will halt when started before the network connection is made, displaying an error message and requiring a keypress), loss of control of the machine due to software problems (machine hang, termination of remote control or networking software, etc.), and virus infection or hard disk corruption. Therefore, the use of a reliable server-class machine with RAID drives, redundant power supplies, etc., will help to maximize availability. Additionally, a device which can switch the machine off and on again, controlled perhaps by a remote signal, can force a reboot which will clear problems due to misbehaving software.

For a machine not in constant use, energy can be conserved by putting the machine into low-power RAM standby after a short timeout period. If a connection delay of a minute or two is acceptable, the machine can timeout into hibernation, powered off with its state saved to disk.

==Wake on Internet==

The originator of the wakeup signal (magic packet) does not have to be on the same local area network (LAN) as the computer being woken. It can be sent from anywhere using:

# A virtual private network (VPN)which makes the originator appear to be a member of the LAN.
# The Internet with local broadcastingsome routers permit a packet received from the Internet to be broadcast to the entire LAN; the default TCP or UDP ports preconfigured to relay WoL requests are usually ports 7 (Echo Protocol), 9 (Discard Protocol), or both. This proxy setting must be enabled in the router, and port forwarding rules may need to be configured in its embedded firewall in order to accept magic packets coming from the internet side to these restricted port numbers, and to allow rebroadcasting them on the local network (normally to the same ports and the same TCP or UDP protocol). Such routers may also be configurable to use different port numbers for this proxying service.
# The Internet without local broadcastingif (as often) the firewall or router at the destination does not permit packets received from the Internet to be broadcast to the local network, Wake-on-Internet may still be achieved by sending the magic packet to any specified port of the destination&#x27;s Internet address, having previously set the firewall or router to forward packets arriving at that port to the local IP address of the computer being woken. The router may require reservation of the local IP address of the computer being woken in order to forward packets to it when it is not live.

<text>Witchcraft is the use of alleged supernatural powers of magic. A witch is a practitioner of witchcraft. Traditionally, &quot;witchcraft&quot; means the use of magic or supernatural powers to inflict harm or misfortune on others, and this remains the most common and widespread meaning. According to &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot;, &quot;Witchcraft thus defined exists more in the imagination&quot;, but it &quot;has constituted for many cultures a viable explanation of evil in the world&quot;. The belief in witchcraft has been found throughout history in a great number of societies worldwide. Most of these societies have used protective magic or counter-magic against witchcraft, and have shunned, banished, imprisoned, physically punished or killed alleged witches. Anthropologists use the term &quot;witchcraft&quot; for similar beliefs about harmful occult practices in different cultures, and these societies often use the term when speaking in English.

Belief in witchcraft as malevolent magic is attested from ancient Mesopotamia, and in Europe, belief in witches traces back to classical antiquity. In medieval and early modern Europe, accused witches were usually women who were believed to have secretly used black magic (&quot;maleficium&quot;) against their own community. Usually, accusations of witchcraft were made by neighbors of accused witches, and followed from social tensions. Witches were sometimes said to have communed with demons or with the Devil, though anthropologist Jean La Fontaine notes that such accusations were mainly made against perceived &quot;enemies of the Church&quot;. It was thought witchcraft could be thwarted by white magic, provided by &#x27;cunning folk&#x27; or &#x27;wise people&#x27;. Suspected witches were often prosecuted and punished, if found guilty or simply believed to be guilty. European witch-hunts and witch trials in the early modern period led to tens of thousands of executions. While magical healers and midwives were sometimes accused of witchcraft themselves, they made up a minority of those accused. European belief in witchcraft gradually dwindled during and after the Age of Enlightenment.

Many indigenous belief systems that include the concept of witchcraft likewise define witches as malevolent, and seek healers (such as medicine people and witch doctors) to ward-off and undo bewitchment. Some African and Melanesian peoples believe witches are driven by an evil spirit or substance inside them. Modern witch-hunting takes place in parts of Africa and Asia.

Starting in the 1930s, followers of certain types of modern paganism began to identify as witches and redefined the term &quot;witchcraft&quot; as part of their beliefs and practices. Neopagan witchcraft may combine aspects of magic, nature worship, divination, and herbalism, and is typically practiced with the goal of self-help or healing. Other neo-pagans avoid the term &quot;witchcraft&quot; due to its negative connotations.

==Concept==

The most common meaning of &quot;witchcraft&quot; worldwide is the use of harmful magic. Belief in malevolent magic and the concept of witchcraft has lasted throughout recorded history and has been found in cultures worldwide, regardless of development. Most societies have feared an ability by some individuals to cause supernatural harm and misfortune to others. This may come from mankind&#x27;s tendency &quot;to want to assign occurrences of remarkable good or bad luck to agency, either human or superhuman&quot;. Historians and anthropologists see the concept of &quot;witchcraft&quot; as one of the ways humans have tried to explain strange misfortune. Some cultures have feared witchcraft much less than others, because they tend to have other explanations for strange misfortune. For example, the Gaels of Ireland and the Scottish Highlands historically held a strong belief in fairy folk, who could cause supernatural harm, and witch-hunting was very rare in these regions compared to other regions of the British Isles.

Historian Ronald Hutton outlined five key characteristics ascribed to witches and witchcraft by most cultures that believe in this concept: the use of magic to cause harm or misfortune to others; it was used by the witch against their own community; powers of witchcraft were believed to have been acquired through inheritance or initiation; it was seen as immoral and often thought to involve communion with evil beings; and witchcraft could be thwarted by defensive magic, persuasion, intimidation or physical punishment of the alleged witch.

A common belief worldwide is that witches use objects, words, and gestures to cause supernatural harm, or that they simply have an innate power to do so. Hutton notes that both kinds of practitioners are often believed to exist in the same culture and that the two often overlap, in that someone with an inborn power could wield that power through material objects. 

One of the most influential works on witchcraft and concepts of magic was E. E. Evans-Pritchard&#x27;s &quot;Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic Among the Azande&quot;, a study of Azande witchcraft beliefs published in 1937. This provided definitions for witchcraft which became a convention in anthropology. However, some researchers argue that the general adoption of Evans-Pritchard&#x27;s definitions constrained discussion of witchcraft beliefs, and even broader discussion of magic and religion, in ways that his work does not support. Evans-Pritchard reserved the term &quot;witchcraft&quot; for the actions of those who inflict harm by their inborn power and used &quot;sorcery&quot; for those who needed tools to do so. Historians found these definitions difficult to apply to European witchcraft, where witches were believed to use physical techniques, as well as some who were believed to cause harm by thought alone. The distinction &quot;has now largely been abandoned, although some anthropologists still sometimes find it relevant to the particular societies with which they are concerned&quot;.
While most cultures believe witchcraft to be something willful, some Indigenous peoples in Africa and Melanesia believe witches have a substance or an evil spirit in their bodies that drives them to do harm. Such substances may be believed to act on their own while the witch is sleeping or unaware. The Dobu people believe women work harmful magic in their sleep while men work it while awake. Further, in cultures where substances within the body are believed to grant supernatural powers, the substance may be good, bad, or morally neutral. Hutton draws a distinction between those who unwittingly cast the evil eye and those who deliberately do so, describing only the latter as witches.

The universal or cross-cultural validity of the terms &quot;witch&quot; and &quot;witchcraft&quot; are debated. Hutton states: 
According to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions there is &quot;difficulty of defining &#x27;witches&#x27; and &#x27;witchcraft&#x27; across culturesterms that, quite apart from their connotations in popular culture, may include an array of traditional or faith healing practices&quot;.

Anthropologist Fiona Bowie notes that the terms &quot;witchcraft&quot; and &quot;witch&quot; are used differently by scholars and the general public in at least four ways. Neopagan writer Isaac Bonewits proposed dividing witches into even more distinct types including, but not limited to: Neopagan, Feminist, Neogothic, Neoclassical, Classical, Family Traditions, Immigrant Traditions, and Ethnic.

== Etymology ==

The word is over a thousand years old: Old English formed the compound from (&#x27;witch&#x27;) and (&#x27;craft&#x27;). The masculine form was (&#x27;male sorcerer&#x27;).

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, &quot;wicce&quot; and &quot;wicca&quot; were probably derived from the Old English verb , meaning &#x27;to practice witchcraft&#x27;. &quot;Wiccian&quot; has a cognate in Middle Low German (attested from the 13th century). The further etymology of this word is problematic. It has no clear cognates in other Germanic languages outside of English and Low German, and there are numerous possibilities for the Indo-European root from which it may have derived.

Another Old English word for &#x27;witch&#x27; was or , which became the modern English word &quot;hag&quot; and is linked to the word &quot;hex&quot;. In most other Germanic languages, their word for &#x27;witch&#x27; comes from the same root as these; for example German and Dutch .

In colloquial modern English, the word &quot;witch&quot; is particularly used for women. A male practitioner of magic or witchcraft is more commonly called a &#x27;wizard&#x27;, or sometimes, &#x27;warlock&#x27;. When the word &quot;witch&quot; is used to refer to a member of a neo-pagan tradition or religion (such as Wicca), it can refer to a person of any gender.

== Beliefs about practices ==
Witches are commonly believed to cast curses; a spell or set of magical words and gestures intended to inflict supernatural harm. Cursing could also involve inscribing runes or sigils on an object to give that object magical powers; burning or binding a wax or clay image (a poppet) of a person to affect them magically; or using herbs, animal parts and other substances to make potions or poisons. Witchcraft has been blamed for many kinds of misfortune. In Europe, by far the most common kind of harm attributed to witchcraft was illness or death suffered by adults, their children, or their animals. &quot;Certain ailments, like impotence in men, infertility in women, and lack of milk in cows, were particularly associated with witchcraft&quot;. Illnesses that were poorly understood were more likely to be blamed on witchcraft. Edward Bever writes: &quot;Witchcraft was particularly likely to be suspected when a disease came on unusually swiftly, lingered unusually long, could not be diagnosed clearly, or presented some other unusual symptoms&quot;.

A common belief in cultures worldwide is that witches tend to use something from their target&#x27;s body to work magic against them; for example hair, nail clippings, clothing, or bodily waste. Such beliefs are found in Europe, Africa, South Asia, Polynesia, Melanesia, and North America. Another widespread belief among Indigenous peoples in Africa and North America is that witches cause harm by introducing cursed magical objects into their victim&#x27;s body; such as small bones or ashes. James George Frazer described this kind of magic as imitative. 

In some cultures, witches are believed to use human body parts in magic, and they are commonly believed to murder children for this purpose. In Europe, &quot;cases in which women did undoubtedly kill their children, because of what today would be called postpartum psychosis, were often interpreted as yielding to diabolical temptation&quot;.

Witches are believed to work in secret, sometimes alone and sometimes with other witches. Hutton writes: &quot;Across most of the world, witches have been thought to gather at night, when normal humans are inactive, and also at their most vulnerable in sleep&quot;. In most cultures, witches at these gatherings are thought to transgress social norms by engaging in cannibalism, incest and open nudity. 

Witches around the world commonly have associations with animals. Rodney Needham identified this as a defining feature of the witch archetype. In some parts of the world, it is believed witches can shapeshift into animals, or that the witch&#x27;s spirit travels apart from their body and takes an animal form, an activity often associated with shamanism. Another widespread belief is that witches have an animal helper. In English these are often called &quot;familiars&quot;, and meant an evil spirit or demon that had taken an animal form. As researchers examined traditions in other regions, they widened the term to servant spirit-animals which are described as a part of the witch&#x27;s own soul. 

Necromancy is the practice of conjuring the spirits of the dead for divination or prophecy, although the term has also been applied to raising the dead for other purposes. The biblical Witch of Endor performed it (1 Samuel 28th chapter), and it is among the witchcraft practices condemned by Ælfric of Eynsham: &quot;Witches still go to cross-roads and to heathen burials with their delusive magic and call to the devil; and he comes to them in the likeness of the man that is buried there, as if he arises from death.&quot;

== Witchcraft and folk healers ==
Most societies that have believed in harmful or black magic have also believed in helpful or white magic. Where belief in harmful magic is common, it is typically forbidden by law as well as hated and feared by the general populace, while helpful or apotropaic (protective) magic is tolerated or accepted by the population, even if the orthodox establishment opposes it.

In these societies, practitioners of helpful magic provide (or provided) services such as breaking the effects of witchcraft, healing, divination, finding lost or stolen goods, and love magic. In Britain, and some other parts of Europe, they were commonly known as &#x27;cunning folk&#x27; or &#x27;wise people&#x27;. Alan Macfarlane wrote that while cunning folk is the usual name, some are also known as &#x27;blessers&#x27; or &#x27;wizards&#x27;, but might also be known as &#x27;white&#x27;, &#x27;good&#x27;, or &#x27;unbinding witches&#x27;. Historian Owen Davies says the term &quot;white witch&quot; was rarely used before the 20th century. Ronald Hutton uses the general term &quot;service magicians&quot;. Often these people were involved in identifying alleged witches.

Such helpful magic-workers &quot;were normally contrasted with the witch who practiced &quot;maleficium&quot;—that is, magic used for harmful ends&quot;. In the early years of the European witch hunts &quot;the cunning folk were widely tolerated by church, state and general populace&quot;. Some of the more hostile churchmen and secular authorities tried to smear folk-healers and magic-workers by falsely branding them &#x27;witches&#x27; and associating them with harmful &#x27;witchcraft&#x27;, but generally the masses did not accept this and continued to make use of their services. The English MP and skeptic Reginald Scot sought to disprove magic and witchcraft altogether, writing in &quot;The Discoverie of Witchcraft&quot; (1584), &quot;At this day, it is indifferent to say in the English tongue, &#x27;she is a witch&#x27; or &#x27;she is a wise woman&#x27;&quot;. Historian Keith Thomas adds &quot;Nevertheless, it is possible to isolate that kind of &#x27;witchcraft&#x27; which involved the employment (or presumed employment) of some occult means of doing harm to other people in a way which was generally disapproved of. In this sense the belief in witchcraft can be defined as the attribution of misfortune to occult human agency&quot;.

Emma Wilby says folk magicians in Europe were viewed ambivalently by communities, and were considered as capable of harming as of healing, which could lead to their being accused as malevolent witches. She suggests some English &quot;witches&quot; convicted of consorting with demons may have been cunning folk whose supposed fairy familiars had been demonised.

Hutton says that magical healers &quot;were sometimes denounced as witches, but seem to have made up a minority of the accused in any area studied&quot;. Likewise, Davies says &quot;relatively few cunning-folk were prosecuted under secular statutes for witchcraft&quot; and were dealt with more leniently than alleged witches. The Constitutio Criminalis Carolina (1532) of the Holy Roman Empire, and the Danish Witchcraft Act of 1617, stated that workers of folk magic should be dealt with differently from witches. It was suggested by Richard Horsley that &#x27;diviner-healers&#x27; () made up a significant proportion of those tried for witchcraft in France and Switzerland, but more recent surveys conclude that they made up less than 2% of the accused. However, Éva Pócs says that half the accused witches in Hungary seem to have been healers, and Kathleen Stokker says the &quot;vast majority&quot; of Norway&#x27;s accused witches were folk healers.

==Witch-hunts and thwarting witchcraft==
Societies that believe (or believed) in witchcraft may also believe that it can be thwarted in various ways. One common way is to use protective magic or counter-magic, often with the help of magical healers such as cunning folk or witch-doctors. This includes performing rituals, reciting charms, or the use of talismans, amulets, anti-witch marks, witch bottles, witch balls, and burying objects such as horse skulls inside the walls of buildings. Another believed cure for bewitchment is to persuade or force the alleged witch to lift their spell. Often, people have attempted to thwart the witchcraft by physically punishing the alleged witch, such as by banishing, wounding, torturing or killing them. Hutton wrote that &quot;In most societies, however, a formal and legal remedy was preferred to this sort of private action&quot;, whereby the alleged witch would be prosecuted and then formally punished if found guilty.

=== Accusations of witchcraft ===

Throughout the world, accusations of witchcraft are often linked to social and economic tensions. Females are most often accused, but in some cultures it is mostly males, such as in Iceland. In many societies, accusations are directed mainly against the elderly, but in others age is not a factor, and in some cultures it is mainly adolescents who are accused. 

Éva Pócs writes that reasons for accusations of witchcraft fall into four general categories. The first three of which were proposed by Richard Kieckhefer, and the fourth added by Christina Larner:
# A person was caught in the act of positive or negative sorcery
# A well-meaning sorcerer or healer lost their clients&#x27; or the authorities&#x27; trust
# A person did nothing more than gain the enmity of their neighbors
# A person was reputed to be a witch and surrounded with an aura of witch-beliefs or occultism.

===Modern witch-hunts===
Witch-hunts, scapegoating, and the shunning or murder of suspected witches still occurs. Many cultures worldwide continue to have a belief in the concept of &quot;witchcraft&quot; or malevolent magic.

Apart from extrajudicial violence, state-sanctioned execution also occurs in some jurisdictions. For instance, in Saudi Arabia practicing witchcraft and sorcery is a crime punishable by death and the country has executed people for this crime as recently as 2014.

Witchcraft-related violence is often discussed as a serious issue in the broader context of violence against women. In Tanzania, an estimated 500 older women are murdered each year following accusations of witchcraft or accusations of being a witch, according to a 2014 World Health Organization report.

Children who live in some regions of the world, such as parts of Africa, are also vulnerable to violence stemming from witchcraft accusations. Such incidents have also occurred in immigrant communities in Britain, including the much publicized case of the murder of Victoria Climbié.

== Religious perspectives ==
===Ancient Mesopotamian religion===
Magic was an important part of ancient Mesopotamian religion and society, which distinguished between &#x27;good&#x27; (helpful) and &#x27;bad&#x27; (harmful) rites. In ancient Mesopotamia, they mainly used counter-magic against witchcraft (&quot;kišpū&quot;), but the law codes also prescribed the death penalty for those found guilty of witchcraft. According to Tzvi Abusch, ancient Mesopotamian ideas about witches and witchcraft shifted over time, and the early stages were &quot;comparable to the archaic shamanistic stage of European witchcraft&quot;. In this early stage, witches were not necessarily considered evil, but took &#x27;white&#x27; and &#x27;black&#x27; forms, could help others using magic and medical knowledge, generally lived in rural areas and sometimes exhibited ecstatic behavior.

In ancient Mesopotamia, a witch (m. &quot;kaššāpu&quot;, f. &quot;kaššāptu&quot;, from &quot;kašāpu&quot; [&#x27;to bewitch&#x27;]) was &quot;usually regarded as an anti-social and illegitimate practitioner of destructive magic ... whose activities were motivated by malice and evil intent and who was opposed by the &quot;ašipu&quot;, an exorcist or incantation-priest&quot;. These &quot;ašipu&quot; were predominantly male representatives of the state religion, whose main role was to work magic against harmful supernatural forces such as demons. The stereotypical witch mentioned in the sources tended to be those of low status who were weak or otherwise marginalized, including women, foreigners, actors, and peddlers.

The Law Code of Hammurabi (18th century BCE) allowed someone accused of witchcraft (harmful magic) to undergo trial by ordeal, by jumping into a holy river. If they drowned, they were deemed guilty and the accuser inherited the guilty person&#x27;s estate. If they survived, the &quot;accuser&#x27;s&quot; estate was handed over instead.

The &quot;Maqlû&quot; (&quot;burning&quot;) is an ancient Akkadian text, written early in the first millennium BCE, which sets out a Mesopotamian anti-witchcraft ritual. This lengthy ritual includes invoking various gods, burning an effigy of the witch, then dousing and disposing of the remains.

===Abrahamic religions===
Witchcraft&#x27;s historical evolution in the Middle East reveals a multi-phase journey influenced by culture, spirituality, and societal norms. Ancient witchcraft in the Near East intertwined mysticism with nature through rituals and incantations aligned with local beliefs. In ancient Judaism, magic had a complex relationship, with some forms accepted due to mysticism while others were considered heretical. The medieval Middle East experienced shifting perceptions of witchcraft under Islamic and Christian influences, sometimes revered for healing and other times condemned as heresy.

==== Jewish ====

Jewish attitudes toward witchcraft were rooted in its association with idolatry and necromancy, and some rabbis even practiced certain forms of magic themselves. References to witchcraft in the Tanakh, or Hebrew Bible, highlighted strong condemnations rooted in the &quot;abomination&quot; of magical belief. Christianity similarly condemned witchcraft, considering it an abomination and even citing specific verses to justify witch-hunting during the early modern period.

==== Christian ====
Historically, the Christian concept of witchcraft derives from Old Testament laws against it. In medieval and early modern Europe, many Christians believed in magic. As opposed to the helpful magic of the cunning folk, witchcraft was seen as evil and associated with Satan and Devil worship. This often resulted in deaths, torture and scapegoating (casting blame for misfortune), and many years of large scale witch-trials and witch hunts, especially in Protestant Europe, before largely ending during the Age of Enlightenment. Christian views in the modern day are diverse, ranging from intense belief and opposition (especially by Christian fundamentalists) to non-belief. During the Age of Colonialism, many cultures were exposed to the Western world via colonialism, usually accompanied by intensive Christian missionary activity (see Christianization). In these cultures, beliefs about witchcraft were partly influenced by the prevailing Western concepts of the time.

In Christianity, sorcery came to be associated with heresy and apostasy and to be viewed as evil. Among Catholics, Protestants, and the secular leadership of late medieval/early modern Europe, fears about witchcraft rose to fever pitch and sometimes led to large-scale witch-hunts. The fifteenth century saw a dramatic rise in awareness and terror of witchcraft. Tens of thousands of people were executed, and others were imprisoned, tortured, banished, and had lands and possessions confiscated. The majority of those accused were women, though in some regions the majority were men. In Scots, the word warlock came to be used as the male equivalent of witch (which can be male or female, but is used predominantly for females).

The &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot; (Latin for &#x27;Hammer of The Witches&#x27;) was a witch-hunting manual written in 1486 by two German monks, Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger. It was used by both Catholics and Protestants for several hundred years, outlining how to identify a witch, what makes a woman more likely than a man to be a witch, how to put a witch on trial, and how to punish a witch. The book defines a witch as evil and typically female. It became the handbook for secular courts throughout Europe, but was not used by the Inquisition, which even cautioned against relying on it. It was the most sold book in Europe for over 100 years, after the Bible.

==== Islamic ====

Islamic perspectives on magic encompass a wide range of practices, with belief in black magic and the evil eye coexisting alongside strict prohibitions against its practice. The Quran acknowledges the existence of magic and seeks protection from its harm. Islam&#x27;s stance is against the practice of magic, considering it forbidden, and emphasizes divine miracles rather than magic or witchcraft. The historical continuity of witchcraft in the Middle East underlines the complex interaction between spiritual beliefs and societal norms across different cultures and epochs.

=== Modern paganism ===
During the 20th century, interest in witchcraft rose in English-speaking and European countries. From the 1920s, Margaret Murray popularized the &#x27;witch-cult hypothesis&#x27;: the idea that those persecuted as &#x27;witches&#x27; in early modern Europe were followers of a benevolent pagan religion that had survived the Christianization of Europe. This has been discredited by further historical research.

From the 1930s, occult neopagan groups began to emerge who called their religion a kind of &#x27;witchcraft&#x27;. They were initiatory secret societies inspired by Murray&#x27;s &#x27;witch cult&#x27; theory, ceremonial magic, Aleister Crowley&#x27;s Thelema, and historical paganism. The biggest religious movement to emerge from this is Wicca. Today, some Wiccans and members of related traditions self-identify as &quot;witches&quot; and use the term &quot;witchcraft&quot; for their magico-religious beliefs and practices, primarily in Western anglophone countries.

== Regional perspectives ==


A 2022 study found that belief in witchcraft, as in the use of malevolent magic or powers, is still widespread in some parts of the world. It found that belief in witchcraft varied from 9% of people in some countries to 90% in others, and was linked to cultural and socioeconomic factors. Stronger belief in witchcraft correlated with poorer economic development, weak institutions, lower levels of education, lower life expectancy, lower life satisfaction, and high religiosity.

It contrasted two hypotheses about future changes in witchcraft belief:
* witchcraft beliefs should decline &quot;in the process of development due to improved security and health, lower exposure to shocks, spread of education and scientific approach to explaining life events&quot; according to standard modernization theory
* &quot;some aspects of development, namely rising inequality, globalization, technological change, and migration, may instead revive witchcraft beliefs by disrupting established social order&quot; according to literature largely inspired by observations from Sub-Saharan Africa.

=== Africa ===

African witchcraft encompasses various beliefs and practices. These beliefs often play a significant role in shaping social dynamics and can influence how communities address challenges and seek spiritual assistance. Much of what &quot;witchcraft&quot; represents in Africa has been susceptible to misunderstandings and confusion, due to a tendency among western scholars to approach the subject through a comparative lens &quot;vis-a-vis&quot; European witchcraft. For example, the Maka people of Cameroon believe in an occult force known as &quot;djambe&quot;, that dwells inside a person. It is often translated as &quot;witchcraft&quot; or &quot;sorcery&quot;, but it has a broader meaning that encompasses supernatural harm, healing and shapeshifting; this highlights the problem of using European terms for African concepts.

While some 19th–20th century European colonialists tried to stamp out witch-hunting in Africa by introducing laws banning accusations of witchcraft, some former African colonies introduced laws banning witchcraft after they gained independence. This has produced an environment that encourages persecution of suspected witches.

In the Central African Republic, hundreds of people are convicted of witchcraft yearly, with reports of violence against accused women. The Democratic Republic of the Congo witnessed a disturbing trend of child witchcraft accusations in Kinshasa, leading to abuse and exorcisms supervised by self-styled pastors. In Ghana, there are several &quot;witch camps&quot;, where women accused of witchcraft can seek refuge, though the government plans to close them.

In west Kenya, there have been cases of accused witches being burned to death in their homes by mobs. Malawi faces a similar issue of child witchcraft accusations, with traditional healers and some Christian counterparts involved in exorcisms, causing abandonment and abuse of children. In Nigeria, Pentecostal pastors have intertwined Christianity with witchcraft beliefs for profit, leading to the torture and killing of accused children. Sierra Leone&#x27;s Mende people see witchcraft convictions as beneficial, as the accused receive support and care from the community.

Lastly, in Zulu culture, healers known as s protect people from witchcraft and evil spirits through divination, rituals and mediumship. However, concerns arise regarding the training and authenticity of some sangomas.

In parts of Africa, beliefs about illness being caused by witchcraft continue to fuel suspicion of modern medicine, with serious healthcare consequences. HIV/AIDS and Ebola are two examples of often-lethal infectious disease epidemics whose medical care and containment has been severely hampered by regional beliefs in witchcraft. Other severe medical conditions whose treatment is hampered in this way include tuberculosis, leprosy, epilepsy and the common severe bacterial Buruli ulcer.

=== Americas ===
====North America====

North America hosts a diverse array of beliefs about witchcraft, some of which have evolved through interactions between cultures.

Native American peoples such as the Cherokee, Hopi, the Navajo among others, believed in malevolent &quot;witch&quot; figures who could harm their communities by supernatural means; this was often punished harshly, including by execution. In these communities, medicine people were healers and protectors against witchcraft.

The term &quot;witchcraft&quot; arrived with European colonists, along with European views on witchcraft. This term would be adopted by many Indigenous communities for their own beliefs about harmful magic and harmful supernatural powers. Witch hunts took place among Christian European settlers in colonial America and the United States, most infamously the Salem witch trials in Massachusetts. These trials led to the execution of numerous individuals accused of practicing witchcraft. Despite changes in laws and perspectives over time, accusations of witchcraft persisted into the 19th century in some regions, such as Tennessee, where prosecutions occurred as late as 1833. 

Some North American witchcraft beliefs were influenced by beliefs about witchcraft in Latin America, and by African witchcraft beliefs through the slave trade. Native American cultures adopted the term for their own witchcraft beliefs. Neopagan witchcraft practices such as Wicca then emerged in the mid-20th century.

==== Latin America ====

Witchcraft beliefs in Latin America are influenced by Spanish Catholic, Indigenous, and African beliefs. In Colonial Mexico, the Mexican Inquisition showed little concern for witchcraft; the Spanish Inquisitors treated witchcraft accusations as a &quot;religious problem that could be resolved through confession and absolution&quot;. Anthropologist Ruth Behar writes that Mexican Inquisition cases &quot;hint at a fascinating conjecture of sexuality, witchcraft, and religion, in which Spanish, indigenous, and African cultures converged&quot;. There are cases where European women and Indigenous women were accused of collaborating to work &quot;love magic&quot; or &quot;sexual witchcraft&quot; against men in colonial Mexico. According to anthropology professor Laura Lewis, &quot;witchcraft&quot; in colonial Mexico represented an &quot;affirmation of hegemony&quot; for women and especially Indigenous women over their white male counterparts in the &quot;casta&quot; system.

Belief in witchcraft is a constant in the history of colonial Brazil, for example the several denunciations and confessions given to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith of Bahia (1591–1593), Pernambuco and Paraíba (1593–1595).

&quot;Brujería&quot;, often called a Latin American form of witchcraft, is a syncretic Afro-Caribbean tradition that combines Indigenous religious and magical practices from the Caribbean, together with Catholicism, and European witchcraft. The tradition and terminology is considered to encompass both helpful and harmful practices. A male practitioner is called a , a female practitioner, a . Healers may be further distinguished by the terms or , a man or woman who performs (&quot;little works&quot;) and (&quot;large treatments&quot;) to promote or restore health, bring fortune or misfortune, deal with unrequited love, and more serious concerns. Sorcery usually involves reference to an entity referred to as the or .

=== Asia ===

====East Asia====
In Chinese culture, the practice of &quot;Gong Tau&quot; involves black magic for purposes such as revenge and financial assistance. Japanese folklore features witch figures who employ foxes as familiars. Korean history includes instances of individuals being condemned for using spells. The Philippines has its own tradition of witches, distinct from Western portrayals, with their practices often countered by indigenous shamans.

====Middle East====
Witchcraft beliefs in the Middle East have a long history, and magic was a part of the ancient cultures and religions of the region. 

In ancient Mesopotamia (Sumeria, Assyria, Babylonia), a witch (m. &quot;kaššāpu&quot;, f. &quot;kaššāptu&quot;) was &quot;usually regarded as an anti-social and illegitimate practitioner of destructive magic ... motivated by malice and evil intent&quot;. Ancient Mesopotamian societies mainly used counter-magic against witchcraft (&quot;kišpū&quot;), but the law codes also prescribed the death penalty for those found guilty of witchcraft. 

For the ancient Hittites, magic could only be sanctioned by the state, and accusations of witchcraft were often used to control political enemies. 

As the ancient Hebrews focused on their worship on Yahweh, Judaism clearly distinguished between forms of magic and mystical practices which were accepted, and those which were viewed as forbidden or heretical, and thus &quot;witchcraft&quot;. 

In the medieval Middle East, under Islamic and Christian influences, witchcraft&#x27;s perception fluctuated between healing and heresy, revered by some and condemned by others. In the present day diverse witchcraft communities have emerged.

=== Europe ===

==== Ancient Roman world ====
European belief in witchcraft can be traced back to classical antiquity, when concepts of magic and religion were closely related. During the pagan era of ancient Rome, there were laws against harmful magic. According to Pliny, the 5th century BCE laws of the Twelve Tables laid down penalties for uttering harmful incantations and for stealing the fruitfulness of someone else&#x27;s crops by magic. The only recorded trial involving this law was that of Gaius Furius Cresimus.

The Classical Latin word meant both poisoning and causing harm by magic (such as magic potions), although ancient people would not have distinguished between the two. In 331 BCE, a deadly epidemic hit Rome and at least 170 women were executed for causing it by &quot;veneficium&quot;. In 184–180 BCE, another epidemic hit Italy, and about 5,000 were executed for &quot;veneficium&quot;. If the reports are accurate, writes Hutton, &quot;then the Republican Romans hunted witches on a scale unknown anywhere else in the ancient world&quot;.

Under the &quot;Lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficis&quot; of 81 BCE, killing by &quot;veneficium&quot; carried the death penalty. During the early Imperial era, the &quot;Lex Cornelia&quot; began to be used more broadly against other kinds of magic, including sacrifices made for evil purposes. The magicians were to be burnt at the stake.

Witch characters—women who work powerful evil magic—appear in ancient Roman literature from the first century BCE onward. They are typically hags who chant harmful incantations; make poisonous potions from herbs and the body parts of animals and humans; sacrifice children; raise the dead; can control the natural world; can shapeshift themselves and others into animals; and invoke underworld deities and spirits. They include Lucan&#x27;s Erichtho, Horace&#x27;s Canidia, Ovid&#x27;s Dipsas, and Apuleius&#x27;s Meroe.

====Early modern and contemporary Europe====
By the early modern period, major witch hunts and witch trials began to take place in Europe, partly fueled by religious tensions, societal anxieties, and economic upheaval. One influential text was the &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot;, a 1486 treatise that provided a framework for identifying, prosecuting, and punishing witches. Witches were typically seen as people who caused harm or misfortune through black magic, and were sometimes believed to have made a pact with the Devil. Usually, accusations of witchcraft were made by neighbors and followed from social tensions. Accusations were often made against marginalized individuals, women, the elderly, and those who did not conform to societal norms. Women made accusations as often as men. The common people believed that magical healers (called &#x27;cunning folk&#x27; or &#x27;wise people&#x27;) could undo bewitchment. Hutton says that magical healers were sometimes denounced as witches themselves, &quot;but seem to have made up a minority of the accused in any area studied&quot;. The witch-craze reached its peak between the 16th and 17th centuries, resulting in the execution of tens of thousands of people. This dark period of history reflects the confluence of superstition, fear, and authority, as well as the societal tendency to find scapegoats for complex problems. A feminist interpretation of the witch trials is that misogynist views led to the association of women and malevolent witchcraft.

During the 16th century and mid 18th century Scotland had 4000-6000 prosecutions against accused witches, a much higher rate then the European average.

Russia also experienced its own iteration of witchcraft trials during the 17th century. Witches were often accused of sorcery and engaging in supernatural activities, leading to their excommunication and execution. The blending of ecclesiastical and secular jurisdictions in Russia&#x27;s approach to witchcraft trials highlighted the intertwined nature of religious and political power during that time. As the 17th century progressed, the fear of witches shifted from mere superstition to a tool for political manipulation, with accusations used to target individuals who posed threats to the ruling elite.

Since the 1940s, neopagan witchcraft movements have emerged in Europe, seeking to revive and reinterpret ancient pagan and mystical practices. Wicca, pioneered by Gerald Gardner, is the most influential. Drawing inspiration from ceremonial magic, historical paganism, and the now-discredited witch-cult theory, Wicca emphasizes a connection to nature, the divine, and personal growth. Similarly, Stregheria in Italy reflects a desire to reconnect with the country&#x27;s pagan past. Many of these neopagans self-identify as &quot;witches&quot;. Neopagan witchcraft in Europe encompasses a wide range of traditions.

<text>Warren is a city in Macomb County in the U.S. state of Michigan. An inner-ring suburb of Detroit, Warren borders Detroit to the north, roughly north of downtown Detroit. The population was 139,387 at the 2020 census, making Warren the largest community in Macomb County, the third-largest city in Michigan, and Detroit&#x27;s largest suburb.

The city is home to a wide variety of businesses, including the General Motors Technical Center, the United States Army Detroit Arsenal, home of the United States Army TACOM Life Cycle Management Command and the Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC), and the headquarters of Asset Acceptance.

==History==
Beebe&#x27;s Corners, the original settlement in what would become the city of Warren, was founded in 1830 at the corner of Mound Road and Chicago Road; its first resident was Charles Groesbeck. Beebe&#x27;s Corners was a carriage stop between Detroit and Utica, and included a distillery, mill, tavern, and trading post. It was not until 1837 that the now-defunct Warren Township was organized around the settlement, first under the name Hickory, then renamed Aba in April 1838, and finally renamed Warren shortly thereafter. It was named for War of 1812 veteran, and frontier cleric, Rev. Abel Warren. However, when it was originally organized the township was named for Rev. Warren, a Methodist Episcopal preacher who left his native New York in 1824 for Shelby Township. He went throughout the present-day Macomb, Lapeer, Oakland, and St. Clair Counties, baptizing, marrying, and burying pioneers of the area, as well as establishing congregations and preaching extensively. He was the first licensed preacher in the State of Michigan.

Another version of the source of the city&#x27;s name claims it was &quot;named for General Joseph Warren, who fell at the Battle of Bunker Hill.&quot;

The settlement was formally incorporated as the Village of Warren from Warren Township on April 28, 1893, out of one square mile bound by 14 Mile Road and 13 Mile Road to the north and south, and in half-a-mile east and west of Mound Road. The small village grew slowly, and had a population of 582 in 1940 and 727 in 1950, while the larger surrounding township grew at a much quicker pace. Much of this growth was due to the construction of the Chrysler&#x27;s Truck Assembly plant in 1938, the Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant in 1940 to support the WW II effort, and the General Motors Technical Center between 1949 and 1956.

The Red Run and Bear Creek, just small creeks back in the 1800s, has blossomed into an open major inter-county stormdrain flowing through Warren, into the Clinton River, and onwards to Lake St. Clair.

The Village of Warren and most of the surrounding Township of Warren, together with Van Dyke, incorporated as a city in 1957, less the city of Center Line, which had incorporated as a village from Warren Township in 1925 and as a city in 1936. Between 1950 and 1960, Warren&#x27;s population soared from 42,653 to 89,426. This population explosion was largely fueled by the post-WWII Baby Boom and later, by white flight from its southern neighbor of Detroit in that decade. This change in population continued into the next decade when the city&#x27;s population doubled again, ultimately reaching a high of 179,000 in 1970.

Historically, Warren was a sundown town: an all-white municipality that excluded non-whites through a combination of discriminatory practices, local ordinances, and violence. In 1970, Warren had a population of 180,000, with only 28 minority families, most of whom lived on a U.S. military base. As late as 1974, African Americans were practically nonexistent in Warren, In 2000 Warren had less than 3% Black population, compared to 80% in adjacent Detroit.

The American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and Freedom from Religion Foundation jointly filed a complaint against the city. In 2015 there was a $100,000 judgment against the city government and Mayor James R. Fouts for denying Marshall the right to establish his atheist station.

<doc id="33971" wikidata="Q14277" url="?curid=33971" title="William Herschel">
<text>Frederick William Herschel ( ; ; 15 November 1738 – 25 August 1822) was a German-British astronomer and composer. He frequently collaborated with his younger sister and fellow astronomer Caroline Herschel. Born in the Electorate of Hanover, William Herschel followed his father into the military band of Hanover, before emigrating to Britain in 1757 at the age of nineteen.

Herschel constructed his first large telescope in 1774, after which he spent nine years carrying out sky surveys to investigate double stars. Herschel published catalogues of nebulae in 1802 (2,500 objects) and in 1820 (5,000 objects). The resolving power of the Herschel telescopes revealed that many objects called nebulae in the Messier catalogue were actually clusters of stars. On 13 March 1781 while making observations he made note of a new object in the constellation of Gemini. This would, after several weeks of verification and consultation with other astronomers, be confirmed to be a new planet, eventually given the name of Uranus. This was the first planet to be discovered since antiquity, and Herschel became famous overnight. As a result of this discovery, George III appointed him Court Astronomer. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and grants were provided for the construction of new telescopes.

Herschel pioneered the use of astronomical spectrophotometry, using prisms and temperature measuring equipment to measure the wavelength distribution of stellar spectra. In the course of these investigations, Herschel discovered infrared radiation.
Other work included an improved determination of the rotation period of Mars, the discovery that the Martian polar caps vary seasonally, the discovery of Titania and Oberon (moons of Uranus) and Enceladus and Mimas (moons of Saturn). Herschel was made a Knight of the Royal Guelphic Order in 1816. He was the first President of the Royal Astronomical Society when it was founded in 1820. He died in August 1822, and his work was continued by his only son, John Herschel.

==Early life and musical activities==
Herschel was born in the Electorate of Hanover in Germany, then part of the Holy Roman Empire, one of ten children of Isaak Herschel and his wife, Anna Ilse Moritzen, of German Lutheran ancestry. His ancestors came from Pirna, in Saxony. Theories that they were Protestants from Bohemia have been questioned by Hamel as the surname Herschel already occurred a century earlier in the very same area in which the family lived.

Herschel&#x27;s father was an oboist in the Hanover Military Band. In 1755 the Hanoverian Guards regiment, in whose band Wilhelm and his brother Jakob were engaged as oboists, was ordered to England. At the time the crowns of Great Britain and Hanover were united under King George II. As the threat of war with France loomed, the Hanoverian Guards were recalled from England to defend Hanover.

After they were defeated at the Battle of Hastenbeck, Herschel&#x27;s father Isaak sent his two sons to seek refuge in England in late 1757. Although his older brother Jakob had received his dismissal from the Hanoverian Guards, Wilhelm was accused of desertion (for which he was pardoned by George III in 1782).

Wilhelm, nineteen years old at this time, was a quick student of the English language. In England, he went by the English rendition of his name, Frederick William Herschel.

In addition to the oboe, he played the violin and harpsichord and later the organ. He composed numerous musical works, including 24 symphonies and many concertos, as well as some church music.

Six of his symphonies were recorded in April 2002 by the London Mozart Players, conducted by Matthias Bamert (Chandos 10048).

He was head of the Durham Militia band from 1760 to 1761. Herschel moved to Sunderland in 1761; Charles Avison engaged him as the first violin and soloist for his Newcastle orchestra, where he played for one season. In &quot;Sunderland in the County of Durh: apprill 20th 1761&quot; he wrote his Symphony No. 8 in C Minor. He visited the home of Sir Ralph Milbanke at Halnaby Hall near Darlington in 1760, where he wrote two symphonies, as well as giving performances himself.
After Newcastle, he moved to Leeds and Halifax where he was the first organist at St John the Baptist church (now Halifax Minster).

In 1766, Herschel became organist of the Octagon Chapel, Bath, a fashionable chapel in a well-known spa, in which city he was also Director of Public Concerts. He was appointed as the organist in 1766 and gave his introductory concert on 1 January 1767. As the organ was still incomplete, he showed off his versatility by performing his own compositions including a violin concerto, an oboe concerto, and a harpsichord sonata.

On 4 October 1767, he performed on the organ for the official opening of the Octagon Chapel.

His sister Caroline arrived in England on 24 August 1772 to live with William in New King Street, Bath. The house they shared is now the location of the Herschel Museum of Astronomy. Herschel&#x27;s brothers Dietrich (1755–1827), Alexander (1745–1821) and Jakob (1734–1792) also appeared as musicians of Bath. In 1780, Herschel was appointed director of the Bath orchestra, with his sister often appearing as soprano soloist.

==Astronomy==

Herschel&#x27;s reading in natural philosophy during the 1770s not only indicates his personal interests, but also suggests an intention to be upwardly mobile, both socially and professionally. He was well-positioned to engage with eighteenth-century &quot;philosophical Gentleman&quot; or philomaths, of wide-ranging logical and practical tastes.
Herschel&#x27;s intellectual curiosity and interest in music eventually led him to astronomy. After reading Robert Smith&#x27;s &quot;Harmonics, or the Philosophy of Musical Sounds&quot; (1749), he took up Smith&#x27;s &quot;A Compleat System of Opticks&quot; (1738), which described techniques of telescope construction. He also read James Ferguson&#x27;s &quot;Astronomy explained upon Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s principles and made easy to those who have not studied mathematics&quot; (1756) and William Emerson&#x27;s &quot;The elements of trigonometry&quot; (1749), &quot;The elements of optics&quot; (1768) and &quot;The principles of mechanics&quot; (1754).

Herschel took lessons from a local mirror-builder and having obtained both tools and a level of expertise, started building his own reflecting telescopes. He would spend up to 16 hours a day grinding and polishing the speculum metal primary mirrors. He relied on the assistance of other family members, particularly his sister Caroline and his brother Alexander, a skilled mechanical craftsperson.

He &quot;began to look at the planets and the stars&quot; in May 1773 and on 1 March 1774 began an astronomical journal by noting his observations of Saturn&#x27;s rings and the Great Orion Nebula (M42).
The English Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne visited the Herschels while they were at Walcot (which they left on 29 September 1777).
By 1779, Herschel had also made the acquaintance of Sir William Watson, who invited him to join the Bath Philosophical Society. Herschel became an active member, and through Watson would greatly enlarge his circle of contacts. A few years later, in 1785, Herschel was elected an international member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia.

===Double stars===
Herschel&#x27;s early observational work soon focused on the search for pairs of stars that were very close together visually. Astronomers of the era expected that changes over time in the apparent separation and relative location of these stars would provide evidence for both the proper motion of stars and, by means of parallax shifts in their separation, for the distance of stars from the Earth. The latter was a method first suggested by Galileo Galilei.
From the back garden of his house in New King Street, Bath, and using a , (f/13) Newtonian telescope &quot;with a most capital speculum&quot; of his own manufacture, in October 1779, Herschel began a systematic search for such stars among &quot;every star in the Heavens&quot;, with new discoveries listed through 1792. He soon discovered many more binary and multiple stars than expected, and compiled them with careful measurements of their relative positions in two catalogues presented to the Royal Society in London in 1782 (269 double or multiple systems) and 1784 (434 systems). A third catalogue of discoveries made after 1783 was published in 1821 (145 systems).

The Rev. John Michell of Thornhill published work in 1767 on the distribution of double stars, and in 1783 on &quot;dark stars&quot;, that may have influenced Herschel. After Michell&#x27;s death in 1793, Herschel bought a ten-foot-long, 30-inch reflecting telescope from Michell&#x27;s estate.

In 1797, Herschel measured many of the systems again, and discovered changes in their relative positions that could not be attributed to the parallax caused by the Earth&#x27;s orbit. He waited until 1802 (in &quot;Catalogue of 500 new Nebulae, nebulous Stars, planetary Nebulae, and Clusters of Stars; with Remarks on the Construction of the Heavens&quot;) to announce the hypothesis that the two stars were &quot;binary sidereal systems&quot; orbiting under mutual gravitational attraction, a hypothesis he confirmed in 1803 in his &quot;Account of the Changes that have happened, during the last Twenty-five Years, in the relative Situation of Double-stars; with an Investigation of the Cause to which they are owing&quot;. In all, Herschel discovered over 800 confirmed double or multiple star systems, almost all of them physical rather than optical pairs. His theoretical and observational work provided the foundation for modern binary star astronomy; new catalogues adding to his work were not published until after 1820 by Friedrich Wilhelm Struve, James South and John Herschel.

===Uranus===
In March 1781, during his search for double stars, Herschel noticed an object appearing as a disk. Herschel originally thought it was a comet or a stellar disc, which he believed he might actually resolve. He reported the sighting to Nevil Maskelyne the Astronomer Royal. He made many more observations of it, and afterwards Russian Academician Anders Lexell computed the orbit and found it to be probably planetary.

Herschel agreed, determining that it must be a planet beyond the orbit of Saturn. He called the new planet the &quot;Georgian star&quot; (Georgium sidus) after King George III, which also brought him favour; the name did not stick. In France, where reference to the British king was to be avoided if possible, the planet was known as &quot;Herschel&quot; until the name &quot;Uranus&quot; was universally adopted. The same year, Herschel was awarded the Copley Medal and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1782, he was appointed &quot;The King&#x27;s Astronomer&quot; (not to be confused with the Astronomer Royal).

On 1 August 1782 Herschel and his sister Caroline moved to Datchet (then in Buckinghamshire but now in Berkshire). There, he continued his work as an astronomer and telescope maker. He achieved an international reputation for their manufacture, profitably selling over 60 completed reflectors to British and Continental astronomers.

===Deep sky surveys===

From 1782 to 1802, and most intensively from 1783 to 1790, Herschel conducted systematic surveys in search of &quot;deep-sky&quot; or non-stellar objects with two , telescopes (in combination with his favoured 6-inch-aperture instrument). Excluding duplicated and &quot;lost&quot; entries, Herschel ultimately discovered over 2,400 objects defined by him as nebulae. (At that time, nebula was the generic term for any visually diffuse astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way, until galaxies were confirmed as extragalactic systems by Edwin Hubble in 1924.)

Herschel published his discoveries as three catalogues: &quot;Catalogue of One Thousand New Nebulae and Clusters of Stars&quot; (1786), &quot;Catalogue of a Second Thousand New Nebulae and Clusters of Stars&quot; (1789) and the previously cited &quot;Catalogue of 500 New Nebulae ...&quot; (1802). He arranged his discoveries under eight &quot;classes&quot;: (I) bright nebulae, (II) faint nebulae, (III) very faint nebulae, (IV) planetary nebulae, (V) very large nebulae, (VI) very compressed and rich clusters of stars, (VII) compressed clusters of small and large [faint and bright] stars, and (VIII) coarsely scattered clusters of stars. Herschel&#x27;s discoveries were supplemented by those of Caroline Herschel (11 objects) and his son John Herschel (1754 objects) and published by him as &quot;General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters&quot; in 1864. This catalogue was later edited by John Dreyer, supplemented with discoveries by many other 19th-century astronomers, and published in 1888 as the &quot;New General Catalogue&quot; (abbreviated NGC) of 7,840 deep-sky objects. The NGC numbering is still the most commonly used identifying label for these celestial landmarks.

Herschel&#x27;s discoveries later compiled in the New General Catalogue include NGC 12, NGC 13, NGC 14, NGC 16, NGC 23, NGC 24, NGC 1357, and NGC 7457.

===Works with his sister Caroline Herschel===

Following the death of their father, William suggested that Caroline join him in Bath, England. In 1772, Caroline was first introduced to astronomy by her brother.

Caroline spent many hours polishing the mirrors of high performance telescopes so that the amount of light captured was maximized. She also copied astronomical catalogues and other publications for William. After William accepted the office of King&#x27;s Astronomer to George III, Caroline became his constant assistant.

In October 1783, a new 20-foot telescope came into service for William. During this time, William was attempting to observe and then record all of the observations. He had to run inside and let his eyes readjust to the artificial light before he could record anything, and then he would have to wait until his eyes were adjusted to the dark before he could observe again. Caroline became his recorder by sitting at a desk near an open window. William would shout out his observations and she would write them down along with any information he needed from a reference book.

Caroline began to make astronomical discoveries in her own right, particularly comets. In 1783, William built her a small Newtonian reflector telescope, with a handle to make a vertical sweep of the sky. Between 1783 and 1787, she made an independent discovery of M110 (NGC 205), which is the second companion of the Andromeda Galaxy. During the years 1786–1797, she discovered or observed eight comets.
She found fourteen new nebulae and, at her brother&#x27;s suggestion, updated and corrected Flamsteed&#x27;s work detailing the position of stars. She also rediscovered Comet Encke in 1795.

Caroline Herschel&#x27;s eight comets were published between 28 August 1782 to 5 February 1787. Five of her comets were published in &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot;. William was even summoned to Windsor Castle to demonstrate Caroline&#x27;s comet to the royal family. William recorded this phenomenon himself, terming it &quot;My Sister&#x27;s Comet.&quot; She wrote letters to the Astronomer Royal to announce the discovery of her second comet, and wrote to Joseph Banks upon the discovery of her third and fourth comets.

The &quot;Catalogue of stars taken from Mr Flamsteed&#x27;s observations&quot; contained an index of more than 560 stars that had not been previously included. Caroline Herschel was honoured by the Royal Astronomical Society for this work in 1828.

Caroline also continued to serve as William Herschel&#x27;s assistant, often taking notes while he observed at the telescope.
For her work as William&#x27;s assistant, she was granted an annual salary of £50 by George III. Her appointment made her the first female in England to be honoured with a government position. It also made her the first woman to be given a salary as an astronomer.

In June 1785, owing to damp conditions, William and Caroline moved to Clay Hall in Old Windsor. On 3 April 1786, the Herschels moved to a new residence on Windsor Road in Slough. Herschel lived the rest of his life in this residence, which came to be known as Observatory House. It was demolished in 1963.

William Herschel&#x27;s marriage in 1788 caused a lot of tension in the brother-sister relationship. Caroline has been referred to as a bitter, jealous woman who worshipped her brother and resented her sister-in-law for invading her domestic life. With the arrival of Mary, Caroline lost her managerial and social responsibilities in the household, and with them much of her status. Caroline destroyed her journals between the years 1788 to 1798, so her feelings during this period are not entirely known. According to her memoir, Caroline then moved to separate lodgings, but continued to work as her brother&#x27;s assistant. When her brother and his family were away from their home, she would often return to take care of it for them. In later life, Caroline and Lady Herschel exchanged affectionate letters.

Caroline continued her astronomical work after William&#x27;s death in 1822. She worked to verify and confirm his findings as well as putting together catalogues of nebulae. Towards the end of her life, she arranged two-and-a-half thousand nebulae and star clusters into zones of similar polar distances. She did this so that her nephew, John, could re-examine them systematically. Eventually, this list was enlarged and renamed the &quot;New General Catalogue&quot;. In 1828, she was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society for her work.

===Herschel&#x27;s telescopes===
The most common type of telescope at that time was the refracting telescope, which involved the refraction of light through a tube using a convex glass lens.
This design was subject to chromatic aberration, a distortion of an image due to the failure of light of different component wavelengths to converge. Optician John Dollond (1706–1761) tried to correct for this distortion by combining two separate lenses, but it was still difficult to achieve good resolution for far distant light sources.

Reflector telescopes, invented by Isaac Newton in 1668, used a single concave mirror rather than a convex lens. This avoids chromatic aberration. The concave mirror gathered more light than a lens, reflecting it onto a flat mirror at the end of the telescope for viewing. A smaller mirror could provide greater magnification and a larger field of view than a convex lens. Newton&#x27;s first mirror was 1.3 inches in diameter; such mirrors were rarely more than 3 inches in diameter.

Because of the poor reflectivity of mirrors made of speculum metal, Herschel eliminated the small diagonal mirror of a standard newtonian reflector from his design and tilted his primary mirror so he could view the formed image directly. This &quot;front view&quot; design has come to be called the Herschelian telescope.

The creation of larger, symmetrical mirrors was extremely difficult. Any flaw would result in a blurred image. Because no one else was making mirrors of the size and magnification desired by Herschel, he determined to make his own. This was no small undertaking. He was assisted by his sister Caroline and other family members. Caroline Herschel described the pouring of a 30-foot-focal-length mirror:

Herschel is reported to have cast, ground, and polished more than four hundred mirrors for telescopes, varying in size from 6 to 48 inches in diameter. Herschel and his assistants built and sold at least sixty complete telescopes of various sizes.
Commissions for the making and selling of mirrors and telescopes provided Herschel with an additional source of income. The King of Spain reportedly paid £3,150 for a telescope.

An essential part of constructing and maintaining telescopes was the grinding and polishing of their mirrors. This had to be done repeatedly, whenever the mirrors deformed or tarnished during use.
The only way to test the accuracy of a mirror was to use it.

====40-foot telescope====

The largest and most famous of Herschel&#x27;s telescopes was a reflecting telescope with a 49-inch-diameter (1.26 m) primary mirror and a focal length. The 40-foot telescope was, at that time, the largest scientific instrument that had been built. It was hailed as a triumph of &quot;human perseverance and zeal for the sublimest science&quot;.

In 1785 Herschel approached King George for money to cover the cost of building the 40-foot telescope. He received £4,000. Without royal patronage, the telescope could not have been created. As it was, it took five years, and went over budget.

The Herschel home in Slough became a scramble of &quot;labourers and workmen, smiths and carpenters&quot;. A 40-foot telescope tube had to be cast of iron. The tube was large enough to walk through. Mirror blanks were poured from Speculum metal, a mix of copper and tin. They were almost in diameter and weighed . When the first disk deformed due to its weight, a second thicker one was made with a higher content of copper. The mirrors had to be hand-polished, a painstaking process. A mirror was repeatedly put into the telescope and removed again to ensure that it was properly formed. When a mirror deformed or tarnished, it had to be removed, repolished and replaced in the apparatus. A huge rotating platform was built to support the telescope, enabling it to be repositioned by assistants as a sweep progressed. A platform near the top of the tube enabled the viewer to look down into the tube and view the resulting image.

In 1789, shortly after this instrument was operational, Herschel discovered a new moon of Saturn: Mimas, only in diameter. Discovery of a second moon (Enceladus) followed, within the first month of observation.

The telescope proved very cumbersome, and in spite of its size, not very effective at showing clearer images. Herschel&#x27;s technological innovations had taken him to the limits of what was possible with the technology of his day. The 40-foot would not be improved upon until the Victorians developed techniques for the precision engineering of large, high-quality mirrors. 
William Herschel was disappointed with it.
Most of Herschel&#x27;s observations were done with a smaller , reflector. Nonetheless, the 40-foot caught the public imagination. It inspired scientists and writers including Erasmus Darwin and William Blake, and impressed foreign tourists and French dignitaries. King George was pleased.

Herschel discovered that unfilled telescope apertures can be used to obtain high angular resolution, something which became the essential basis for interferometric imaging in astronomy (in particular aperture masking interferometry and hypertelescopes).

====Reconstruction of the 20-foot telescope====
In 2012, the BBC television programme &quot;Stargazing Live&quot; built a replica of the 20-foot telescope using Herschel&#x27;s original plans but modern materials. It is to be considered a close modern approximation rather than an exact replica. A modern glass mirror was used, the frame uses metal scaffolding and the tube is a sewer pipe. The telescope was shown on the programme in January 2013 and stands on the Art, Design, and Technology campus of the University of Derby where it will be used for educational purposes.

=== Life on other celestial bodies ===

Herschel was sure that he had found ample evidence of life on the Moon and compared it to the English countryside. He did not refrain himself from theorising that the other planets were populated, with a special interest in Mars, which was in line with most of his contemporary scientists. During Herschel&#x27;s time, scientists tended to believe in a plurality of civilised worlds; in contrast, most religious thinkers referred to unique properties of the Earth.
Herschel went so far as to speculate that the interior of the Sun was populated.

=== Sunspots, climate and wheat yields ===
Herschel examined the correlation of solar variation and solar cycle and climate. Over a period of 40 years (1779–1818), Herschel regularly observed sunspots and their variations in number, form and size. Most of his observations took place in a period of low solar activity, the Dalton Minimum, when sunspots were relatively few in number. This was one of the reasons why Herschel was not able to identify the standard 11-year period in solar activity.
Herschel compared his observations with the series of wheat prices published by Adam Smith in &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;.

In 1801, Herschel reported his findings to the Royal Society and indicated five prolonged periods of few sunspots correlated with the price of wheat. Herschel&#x27;s study was ridiculed by some of his contemporaries but did initiate further attempts to find a correlation. Later in the 19th century, William Stanley Jevons proposed the 11-year cycle with Herschel&#x27;s basic idea of a correlation between the low number of sunspots and lower yields explaining recurring booms and slumps in the economy.

Herschel&#x27;s speculation on a connection between sunspots and regional climate, using the market price of wheat as a proxy, continues to be cited.
According to one study, the influence of solar activity can actually be seen on the historical wheat market in England over ten solar cycles between 1600 and 1700. The evaluation is controversial and the significance of the correlation is doubted by some scientists.

===Further discoveries===
In his later career, Herschel discovered two moons of Saturn, Mimas and Enceladus; as well as two moons of Uranus, Titania and Oberon. He did not give these moons their names; they were named by his son John in 1847 and 1852, respectively, after his death. Herschel measured the axial tilt of Mars and discovered that the Martian ice caps, first observed by Giovanni Domenico Cassini (1666) and Christiaan Huygens (1672), changed size with that planet&#x27;s seasons. It has been suggested that Herschel discovered rings around Uranus.

Herschel introduced but did not create the word &quot;asteroid&quot;, meaning &quot;star-like&quot; (from the Greek &quot;asteroeides&quot;, &quot;aster&quot; &quot;star&quot; + &quot;-eidos&quot; &quot;form, shape&quot;), in 1802 (shortly after Olbers discovered the second minor planet, 2 Pallas, in late March), to describe the star-like appearance of the small moons of the giant planets and of the minor planets; the planets all show discs, by comparison. By the 1850s &#x27;asteroid&#x27; became a standard term for describing certain minor planets.

From studying the proper motion of stars, the nature and extent of the solar motion was first demonstrated by Herschel in 1783, along with first determining the direction for the solar apex to Lambda Herculis, only 10° away from today&#x27;s accepted position.

Herschel also studied the structure of the Milky Way and was the first to propose a model of the galaxy based on observation and measurement. He concluded that it was in the shape of a disk, but incorrectly assumed that the Sun was in the centre of the disk. This heliocentric view was eventually replaced by galactocentrism due to the work of Harlow Shapley, Heber Doust Curtis and Edwin Hubble in the 20th century. All three men used significantly more far-reaching and accurate telescopes than Herschel&#x27;s.

== Discovery of infrared radiation in sunlight ==
In early 1800, Herschel was testing different filters to pass sunlight through, and noticed that filters of different colors seemed to generate varying amounts of heat. He decided to pass the light through a prism to measure the different colors of light using a thermometer, and in the process, took a measurement just beyond the red end of the visible spectrum. He detected a temperature one degree higher than that of red light. Further experimentation led to Herschel&#x27;s conclusion that there must be an invisible form of light beyond the visible spectrum. He published these results in April 1800.

==Biology==
Herschel used a microscope to establish that coral was not a plant – as many at the time believed – because it lacked the cell walls characteristic of plants. It is in fact an animal, a marine invertebrate.

==Family and death==

On 8 May 1788, William Herschel married the widow Mary Pitt (née Baldwin) at St Laurence&#x27;s Church, Upton in Slough. They had one child, John, born at Observatory House on 7 March 1792. William&#x27;s personal background and rise as man of science had a profound impact on the upbringing of his son and grandchildren. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1788. In 1816, William was made a Knight of the Royal Guelphic Order by the Prince Regent and was accorded the honorary title &#x27;Sir&#x27; although this was not the equivalent of an official British knighthood. He helped to found the Astronomical Society of London in 1820, which in 1831 received a royal charter and became the Royal Astronomical Society. In 1813, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

On 25 August 1822, Herschel died at Observatory House, Windsor Road, Slough, Buckinghamshire, after a long illness. Caroline was deeply distressed by his death, and soon after his burial she returned to Hanover, a decision she later regretted. She had lived in England for fifty years. Her interests were much more in line with her nephew John Herschel, also an astronomer, than with her surviving family in Hanover. She continued to work on the organization and cataloguing of nebulae, creating what would later become the basis of the &quot;New General Catalogue&quot;. She died on 9 January 1848.

==Memorial==
William Herschel lived most of his life in the town of Slough, then in Buckinghamshire (now in Berkshire). He died in the town and was buried under the tower of the nearby St Laurence&#x27;s Church, Upton-cum-Chalvey. Herschel&#x27;s epitaph is:

Herschel is especially honoured in Slough and there are several memorials to him and his discoveries. In 2011 a new bus station, the design of which was inspired by the infrared experiment of William Herschel, was built in the centre of Slough.

John Keats alludes to Herschel&#x27;s discovery of Uranus in his 1816 sonnet &quot;On First Looking into Chapman&#x27;s Homer&quot;: &quot;Then felt I like some watcher of the skies/ When a new planet swims into his ken.&quot; Richard Holmes says that Keats &quot;picks out the finding of Uranus, thirty-five years before, as one of the defining moments of the age.&quot;

His house at 19 New King Street in Bath, Somerset, where he made many telescopes and first observed Uranus, is now home to the Herschel Museum of Astronomy.

There is a memorial near the choir screen in Westminster Abbey.
