<text>Worcestershire ( , ; written abbreviation: Worcs) is a ceremonial county in the West Midlands of England. It is bordered by Shropshire, Staffordshire, and the West Midlands county to the north, Warwickshire to the east, Gloucestershire to the south, and Herefordshire to the west. The city of Worcester is the largest settlement and the county town. 

The county is largely rural, and has an area of and a population of 592,057. After Worcester (103,872) the largest settlements are Redditch (87,036), Kidderminster (57,400), and Bromsgrove (34,755). It contains six local government districts, which are part of a two-tier non-metropolitan county also called Worcestershire. The county historically had complex boundaries, and included Dudley and the southwestern suburbs of Birmingham. 

The River Severn flows through the centre of the county from north to south, forming a wide plain. The southwest of the county contains part of the Malvern Hills, a National Landscape which contains Worcestershire Beacon, at the county&#x27;s highest point. The southwest contains a small part of the Cotswolds, and in the northwest is part of the Wyre Forest, a national nature reserve. 

There is some evidence of Roman occupation in Worcestershire; the area later became part of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Hwicce, and then Mercia. Worcestershire was constituted as a county around 927, as the Kingdom of England formed. During the High Middle Ages the county was the site of the Battle of Evesham, in which Simon de Montfort was defeated, and in 1651 the Battle of Worcester was the last major engagement of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. During the Industrial Revolution the north of the county was part of the Black Country, a major manufacturing centre, Kidderminster became famous for carpet production, and Worcester for porcelain.

==Location==
The county borders Herefordshire to the west, Shropshire to the north-west, Staffordshire only just to the north, West Midlands to the north and north-east, Warwickshire to the east and Gloucestershire to the south. The western border with Herefordshire includes a stretch along the top of the Malvern Hills. At the southern border with Gloucestershire, Worcestershire meets the northern edge of the Cotswolds. Two major rivers flow through the county: the Severn and the Avon.

==History==
The geographical area now known as Worcestershire was first populated at least 700,000 years ago. The area became predominantly agricultural in the Bronze Age, leading to population growth and more evidence of settlement. By the Iron Age, hill forts dominated the landscape. Settlement of these swiftly ended with the Roman occupation of Britain.

The Roman period saw establishment of the villa system in the Cotswolds and Vale of Evesham. Droitwich (Salinae) was probably the most important settlement in the county in this period, due to its product of salt. There is also evidence for Roman settlement and industrial activity around Worcester and King&#x27;s Norton.

===Anglo-Saxon Worcestershire===

The area which became Worcestershire formed the heartland of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of the Hwicce. It was absorbed by the Kingdom of Mercia during the 7th century and became part of the unified Kingdom of England in 927. Worcestershire was established as an administrative and defensive unit in the early tenth century. Its purpose was to take into account and defend the estates within the northern area of the historic See of Worcester, held by the Episcopus Hwicciorum and Worcester Priory, along with the Abbots of Pershore, Westminster and Evesham. The shires and its sub-divisions known as hundreds, formed a framework for administering the resources of each burhs&#x27; outlying estates. It was a separate ealdormanship briefly in the 10th century before forming part of the Earldom of Mercia in the 11th century. The last known Anglo-Saxon Sheriff of Worcestershire was Cyneweard of Laughern.

===Norman Conquest===

During the Middle Ages, much of the county&#x27;s economy was based on the wool trade. Many areas of its dense forests, such as Feckenham Forest, Horewell Forest and Malvern Chase, were royal hunting grounds subject to forest law.

After the Norman conquest of England; the Domesday Book noted in 1086 that in seven of the twelve hundreds covering Worcestershire, the Crown had no authority. The Crown&#x27;s authority was replaced by the Bishop of Worcester and the Abbots at Pershore, Westminster and Evesham.

William the Conqueror gave to his allies and friends manors and parishes captured from the Anglo-Saxons. Despite the Norman Conquest, the rest of the county was still held by the Abbeys of Pershore and Evesham, the Bishop of Worcester and Priory.

The first Norman Sheriff Urse d&#x27;Abetot, built the castle of Worcester and seized much church land, some of which became part of the Crown&#x27;s hundreds in Worcestershire. and was in dispute with the Bishop of Worcester over the rights of the sheriff.

Bishop Wulfstan was the last Anglo-Saxon bishop in England, and remained in post until his death in 1095. Under his tenure Worcester Cathedral began major reconstruction, and he opposed political interventions against William and the Normans. He was later made a saint.

===High Medieval===
During Henry III&#x27;s disputes and wars with his Barons, in 1263 Worcester&#x27;s Jewish residents were attacked by a baronial force led by Robert Earl Ferrers and Henry de Montfort. Most were killed. The massacre in Worcester was part of a wider campaign by the De Montforts and their allies in the run-up to the Second Barons&#x27; War, aimed at undermining Henry III. Worcestershire was the site of the Battle of Evesham in which Simon de Montfort was killed on 4 August 1265. A few years later, in 1275, the Jews that were still living in Worcester were forced to move to Hereford, as they were expelled from all towns under the jurisdiction of the queen mother.

===Civil War===
In 1642, the Battle of Powick Bridge was the first major skirmish of the English Civil War. The county suffered from being on the Royalist front line, as it was subject to heavy taxation and the pressing of men into the Royalist army, which also reduced its productive capacity. The northern part of the county, which was already a centre of iron production, was important for military supplies. Parliamentarian raids and Royalist requisitioning both placed a great strain on the county.

There were tensions from the participation of prominent Catholic recusants in the military and civilian organisation of the county. Combined with the opposition to requisitioning from both sides, bands of Clubmen formed to keep the war away from their localities.

The Battle of Worcester in 1651 effectively ended the third civil war. There was little enthusiasm or local participation in the mostly Scottish Royalist army, whose defeat was widely welcomed. Nevertheless, Parliamentarian forces ransacked the city of Worcester, causing heavy damage, looting and destruction of property. Around 10,000 mostly Scottish prisoners were sent into forced labour in the New World or fen drainage schemes. The small bands of Scots that fled into Worcestershire&#x27;s countryside were attacked by local forces and killed.

===Nineteenth century===
In the 19th century, Worcester was a centre for the manufacture of gloves; the town of Kidderminster became a centre for carpet manufacture, and Redditch specialised in the manufacture of needles, springs and hooks. Droitwich Spa, situated on large deposits of salt, was a centre of salt production from Roman times, with one of the principal Roman roads running through the town. These old industries have since declined, to be replaced by other, more varied light industry. The county is also home to the world&#x27;s oldest continually published newspaper, the &quot;Berrow&#x27;s Journal&quot;, established in 1690. Malvern was one of the centres of the 19th-century rise in English spa towns due to Malvern water being believed to be very pure, containing &quot;nothing at all&quot;.

==Demographics==
The 2011 census found the population of Worcestershire to be 566,169, an increase of 4.4% from the 2001 population of 542,107.

===Ethnicity===

Though the total number of people in every ethnic group increased between 2001 and 2011, the White British share of Worcestershire&#x27;s population decreased from 95.5% to 92.4%, as did the share of White ethnic groups as whole, which went from 97.5% to 95.7%. Worcestershire is still much more ethnically homogeneous than the national average. In 2011, 79.8% of the population of England identified as White British; much lower than Worcestershire&#x27;s figure of 92.4%.
==Economy==
In Redditch are Halfords, to the south in Washford, and GKN (it has the second largest turnover in the West Midlands) is in Riverside. Mettis Aerospace are in Enfield, north Redditch, and make light metal components ( former High Duty Alloys, which made most of the forged pistons for Britain&#x27;s aircraft engines in WWII). Phoenix Group (non-public life assurance schemes) is in the north-east of the county near the Warwickshire boundary, at Wythall, and has a large turnover; nearby to west Metalrax, headquartered in Alvechurch, make (via subsidiaries) most of the bakeware sold in the UK.

Morgan Motor Company is in Malvern Link. Commsoft RMS is in Evesham. For many years Group 4 Security, which was the largest security company in Europe, had its headquarters in Broadway, on the edge of the Cotswolds; G4S Integrated Services now has its HQ there.

==Local government==
Local government in Worcestershire has changed several times since the middle of the 19th century.

===1844–1911===

Worcestershire contained numerous exclaves, which were areas of land cut off from the main geographical area of Worcestershire and completely surrounded by the nearby counties of Warwickshire, Staffordshire, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Oxfordshire. The most notable islands were Dudley, Evenlode, Blockley and the area around Shipston-on-Stour. Herefordshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Shropshire had their own exclaves within the main part of Worcestershire at Rochford, Broome, Clent, Tardebigge (Tutnall and Cobley) and Halesowen respectively. Tardebigge&#x27;s history outside the county is even more colourful, changing hands from Worcestershire to Staffordshire and Warwickshire, before returning to Worcestershire at differing times over the centuries. The southern boundary of the county was also complex, with parish boundaries penetrating deep into Gloucestershire and vice versa.

Worcestershire County Council came into existence following the Local Government Act 1888 and covered the historic traditional county, except for two designated county boroughs at Dudley and Worcester.

Birmingham&#x27;s continuous expansion has been a major cause of Worcestershire&#x27;s fluid boundary changes and associated housing issues. The district of Balsall Heath, which had originally constituted the most northerly part of the parish of King&#x27;s Norton, was the first area of the county to be added to the County Borough of Birmingham, on 1 October 1891. This was followed by Quinton Urban District, which was ceded to Birmingham in November 1909, and then by the Rural District of Yardley and the greater part of the Urban District of King&#x27;s Norton and Northfield, which were absorbed into Birmingham under the Greater Birmingham Scheme on 9 November 1911. Thus these areas were transferred from Worcestershire to Warwickshire. Dudley&#x27;s historical status within the Diocese of Worcester and through its aristocratic links ensured that the exclave was governed on a largely autonomous basis. Worcester was designated a county corporate, and thus became separate from the rest of Worcestershire.

===1926 boundary changes===
In 1926, Dudley County Borough council purchased several square miles of land to the north of the town centre, mostly in Sedgley (Staffordshire), including Dudley Castle. This was to build the Priory Estate, a large new council estate on which construction began in 1929. The boundaries of Worcestershire were altered to include all of the proposed new housing estate in Dudley.

===1966–1974===
During the Local Government reorganisation of April 1966, Dudley expanded beyond its historical boundaries and took in the bulk of Sedgley, Brierley Hill and the south of Coseley as well as a small section of Amblecote. The Local Government Act redefined its status and the County Borough of Dudley became part of Staffordshire, the county of which all of these areas had been part. At the same time, Worcestershire gained a new county borough named Warley, which was an amalgamation of Oldbury Urban District, Rowley Regis Urban District, the County Borough of Smethwick and parts of Dudley and Tipton. During this reorganisation, the area of the administrative county grew only where Stourbridge took in the majority of Amblecote Urban District from Staffordshire and the designation of Redditch in 1964 as a New Town. This in turn saw expansion into the area in and around the villages of Ipsley and Matchborough in Warwickshire. The Redditch New Town designation coincided with a considerable programme of social and private house building in Droitwich, Worcester, Bromsgrove, Kidderminster and along the Birmingham boundary at Frankley, Rubery and Rednal. Frankley parish was later split into two: New Frankley and the area around Bartley Reservoir transferred from Bromsgrove District to Birmingham in April 1995; but the small village of Frankley remained in Worcestershire and became a new civil parish under the same name.

===1974–1998===
From 1974, the central and southern parts of the county were amalgamated with Herefordshire and with Worcester County Borough to form a single non-metropolitan county of Hereford and Worcester. The County Boroughs of Dudley and Warley, along with Stourbridge and Halesowen, were incorporated into the new West Midlands Metropolitan county. The West Midlands County Council existed for only a few years before abolition in April 1986, although the West Midlands still exists as a ceremonial county.

===1998–present===

In the 1990s UK local government reform, the county of Hereford &amp; Worcester was abolished, and the non-metropolitan county or shire county of Worcestershire regained its historic border with Herefordshire. The recreated County of Worcestershire came into existence on 1 April 1998 as an administrative and ceremonial county, although this excluded the Black Country towns of Dudley, Halesowen, Oldbury and Stourbridge (which remained part of the West Midlands). Worcestershire County Council was reformed, although some services are shared with the newly formed Herefordshire Council, including waste management and the youth offending service.

The former Hereford and Worcester districts of Redditch, Worcester, Bromsgrove, Wychavon and Wyre Forest were retained with little or no change. However the former Hereford and Worcester districts of Leominster and Malvern Hills straddled the reinstated border with Herefordshire, so a new Malvern Hills district was constituted which aligned with the Worcestershire&#x27;s boundary to the west, south-west and north-west. The remaining parts of the former districts of Leominster and Malvern Hills returned to Herefordshire.

===Summary of main changes===
These settlements were historically part of the county as noted above, that now fall under the counties of Warwickshire, West Midlands or Gloucestershire.

== Physical geography ==

The Malvern Hills, which run from the south of the county into Herefordshire, are made up mainly of volcanic igneous rocks and metamorphic rocks, some of which date from more than 1,200 million years ago. They are designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The Worcestershire Beacon, which at is the highest point in the county, lies in this range.

The rest of the county consists of undulating hills and farmland stretching either side of the Severn valley. The Severn is the United Kingdom&#x27;s longest river and flows through Bewdley, Stourport-on-Severn and Worcester. The River Avon flows through the Worcestershire town on Evesham and joins the Severn at Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire.

Several coniferous and deciduous woodlands are located in the north of the county. The Vale of Evesham runs through the south of the county and to its south are the Cotswolds AONB.
===Green belt===

Worcestershire contains a broad expanse of green belt area, widening to over in places. It is part of the larger belt surrounding the West Midlands county, and first drawn up from the 1950s. All of the county&#x27;s districts other than Malvern Hills contain some portion of the belt.

==Sport==

The largest and most successful football club in the county is Kidderminster Harriers. Founded in 1877 as a running club and doubling as a rugby club from 1880, the football club was founded in 1886. In 1987, the club won the FA Trophy for the first time, and seven years later reached the fifth round of the FA Cup, also winning the GM Vauxhall Conference title in 1994 but being denied Football League status as their Aggborough Stadium did not meet capacity requirements. However, when the club next won the Conference title six years later, their stadium had been upgraded and promotion was granted, giving the county its first (and thus far only) Football League members. However, the club&#x27;s Football League membership was short-lived, as Harriers were relegated back to the Conference in 2005 after just five years in the Football League, and have yet to reclaim their status.

The county is also represented by Alvechurch, Bromsgrove Sporting and Redditch United of the Southern Premier League, and Worcester City of the Northern Premier League.

The county is home to Worcestershire County Cricket Club, traditionally the first stop on any touring national side&#x27;s schedule in England. Formed officially in 1865, the Club initially played in Boughton Park, before moving to its current New Road ground, which today can host 5,500 spectators, in 1895. The club has won five County Championships in its history, most recently in 1989.

Worcester Rugby Football Club, the Worcester Warriors, are the county&#x27;s largest and most successful Rugby Union team, having been promoted to the Premiership in 2004. The Warriors were relegated to the RFU Championship in 2010 but rebounded back to the Premiership in 2011. Worcester Warriors play at the Sixways Stadium on the outskirts of Worcester, holding over 12,000 spectators, thus making it the largest stadium in the county. Sixways has hosted the final of the LV Cup on three occasions.

==Culture==

The village of Broadheath, about northwest of the city of Worcester, is the birthplace of the composer Edward Elgar.

It is claimed that the county was the inspiration for the Shire, a region of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s fictional Middle-earth, described in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Tolkien was thought to have named Bilbo Baggins&#x27; house &quot;Bag End&quot; after his Aunt Jane&#x27;s Worcestershire farm. Tolkien wrote of Worcestershire, &quot;Any corner of that county (however fair or squalid) is in an indefinable way &#x27;home&#x27; to me, as no other part of the world is.&quot;

Worcestershire is one of the three counties associated with the Border Morris style of English folk dancing. Worcestershire Monkey is a popular Border Morris dance; although normally performed as a group of eight, it is sometimes danced &quot;en masse&quot; with multiple Border Morris sides performing the dance together.

Worcestershire appeared as one of the main settings in the DreamWorks Animation animated film &quot;Shrek the Third&quot;. The director Chris Miller said they chose Worcestershire because it is always being mispronounced. &quot;It just made us laugh. Plus we love the sauce, it&#x27;s hugely popular in the States.&quot; The film make multiple references to the real Worcestershire in the film, even commenting on the famous Worcestershire Sauce.

==Media==
Worcestershire has a long history in radio broadcasting. The county is home to the Droitwich Transmitting Station near Wychbold, currently broadcasting BBC Radio 5 Live and commercial radio services - Absolute Radio and TalkSport on Medium Wave/AM and BBC Radio 4 on Long Wave. The site is the location of the British Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s most powerful long-wave transmitter, which during World War II, coded messages read during normal programme broadcasts, were received by the French Resistance. Lying close to the county&#x27;s north western border is the Woofferton Transmitting Station, which was used during the Cold War to broadcast the Voice of America&#x27;s Short Wave transmissions into the Eastern Bloc countries of Europe. These sets of transmitters are still in use today.

In 1939, the BBC bought the historic Wood Norton site near Evesham, and equipped the premises with a dozen temporary studios. These were to be used in the event of an evacuation of the BBC&#x27;s operations in London and other urban areas. By 1940; Wood Norton was one of the largest broadcasting centres in Europe with an average output of 1,300 radio programmes a week. The BBC monitoring service were also based at Wood Norton, where linguists, many of them foreign nationals, were hired to listen in to broadcasts from Europe until they were relocated to Caversham Park in early 1943. The move was made to release space at Wood Norton so that it could become the BBC&#x27;s main broadcasting centre, should London have to be evacuated because of the threat from Nazi Germany&#x27;s V-weapons. The site was also prepared for use during the Cold War, as an emergency broadcast centre. The site is still in use for the BBC&#x27;s engineering and technical training.
===Television===
The county&#x27;s television news is covered by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central from its studios in Birmingham. Television signals are received from either the Ridge Hill or Sutton Coldfield TV transmitters. 

===Radio ===
BBC Hereford &amp; Worcester and Hits Radio Herefordshire &amp; Worcestershire broadcast to both Herefordshire and Worcestershire on analogue and digital radio platforms, whilst Greatest Hits Radio Midlands broadcasts to Kidderminster, Stourport-on-Severn, Bewdley and Droitwich. A community radio station - Radio Wyvern, is licensed to serve the Worcester area. Meanwhile, Capital Mid-Counties, Sunshine Radio and Like Radio, broadcast to the county on VHF/FM and/or DAB Digital Radio. Historically; West Midlands-based radio stations such as BBC Radio WM, Hits Radio Birmingham and Beacon Radio have considered parts of Worcestershire as their broadcast areas. However what were known as Wyvern, Beacon, BRMB along with Mercia are now known collectively as &#x27;Hits Radio&#x27; and under the same Bauer Radio ownership. Other regional stations, such as Heart West Midlands and Smooth West Midlands also cover the county.
In 2007 the Office of Communications (Ofcom) awarded a DAB Digital Radio multiplex licence for Herefordshire &amp; Worcestershire to MuxCo Ltd. MuxCo proposed new stations and a digital radio platform for Wyvern FM, Sunshine Radio and BBC Hereford &amp; Worcester, who were initially licensed to broadcast on VHF/FM and/or AM. MuxCo eventually launched in December 2013 following changes in legislation through the Digital Economy Act 2010, and utilises existing transmitter locations at Great Malvern, Ridge Hill and Bromsgrove. The multiplex continues to uses the same transmission sites, albeit with an additional transmitter at Kidderminster and broadcasts a combination of local and national services. In 2008, MXR, who owned and operated the West Midlands regional DAB multiplex licence, improved coverage of DAB Digital Radio across other parts of the county to include Worcester and Malvern. This regional multiplex closed on 27 August 2013, partially replaced by CE Digital&#x27;s Birmingham DAB Multiplex, who opened new transmitters at Lickey Hills and Headless Cross. Ofcom has earmarked two potential &#x27;Small Scale DAB&#x27; digital radio multiplexes within Worcestershire - one at Worcester, and the other within Bromsgrove, Kidderminster and Redditch. The legal framework for the potential new multiplexes come under &#x27;The Small-Scale Radio Multiplex and Community Digital Radio Order 2019&#x27;.

==Economy==
This is a chart of trend of regional gross value added of Worcestershire at current basic prices published (pp. 240–253) by &quot;Office for National Statistics&quot; with figures in millions of British Pounds Sterling.
===Industry and agriculture===
Fruit farming and the cultivation of hops were traditional agricultural activities in much of the county. During the latter half of the 20th century, this has largely declined with the exception southern area of the county around the Vale of Evesham, where orchards are still worked on a commercial scale. Worcester City&#x27;s coat of arms includes three black pears, representing a now rare local pear variety, the Worcester Black Pear. The county&#x27;s coat of arms follows this theme, having a pear tree with black pears. The apple variety known as Worcester Pearmain originates from Worcestershire, and the Pershore plum comes from the small Worcestershire town of that name, and is widely grown in that area.

Worcestershire is also famous for a number of its non-agricultural products. The original Worcestershire sauce, a savoury condiment made by Lea &amp; Perrins, is made in Worcester, and the now-closed Royal Porcelain works was based in the city. The town of Malvern is the home of the Morgan traditional sports car.

==Education==

Worcestershire has a comprehensive school system with over thirty-five independent schools including the RGS Worcester, The King&#x27;s School, Worcester, Malvern St James and Malvern College. State schools in Worcester, the Wyre Forest District, and the Malvern Hills District are two-tier primary schools and secondary schools whilst Redditch and Bromsgrove have a three-tier system of first, middle and high schools. Several schools in the county provide Sixth-form education including two in the city of Worcester. Several vocational colleges provide GCSE and A-level courses and adult education, such as South Worcestershire College, and an agricultural campus of Warwickshire College in Pershore. There is also the University of Worcester, which is located in the city itself and is home to the National Pollen and Aerobiology Research Unit and five other national research centres.

==Towns and villages==

The county town and only city is Worcester. The other major settlements are Kidderminster, Bromsgrove and Redditch. There are also several market towns: Malvern, Bewdley, Evesham, Droitwich Spa, Pershore, Tenbury Wells, Stourport-on-Severn and Upton-upon-Severn. The village of Hartlebury housed the Bishop of Worcester from the 13th century until 2007.

<text>Worcestershire sauce or Worcester sauce (UK: ) is a fermented liquid condiment invented by pharmacists John Wheeley Lea and William Henry Perrins in the city of Worcester in Worcestershire, England, during the first half of the 19th century. The inventors went on to form the company Lea &amp; Perrins.

Worcestershire sauce has been a generic term since 1876, when the High Court of Justice ruled that Lea &amp; Perrins did not own a trademark for the name &quot;Worcestershire&quot;.

Worcestershire sauce is used directly as a condiment on steaks, hamburgers, and other finished dishes, and to flavour cocktails such as the Bloody Mary and Caesar. It is also frequently used to augment recipes such as Welsh rarebit, Caesar salad, Oysters Kirkpatrick, and devilled eggs. As both a background flavour and a source of umami (savoury), it is also added to dishes such as beef stew and baked beans.

==History==

Fish-based fermented sauces, such as garum, go back to antiquity. However, no direct link of Worcestershire sauce with such earlier sauces has been demonstrated and they were made very differently.

In the seventeenth century, English recipes for sauces (typically to put &quot;on&quot; fish) already combined anchovies with other ingredients.

The Lea &amp; Perrins brand was commercialised in 1837 and was the first type of sauce to bear the Worcestershire name. The origin of the Lea &amp; Perrins recipe is unclear. The packaging originally stated that the sauce came &quot;from the recipe of a nobleman in the county&quot;. The company has also claimed that &quot;Lord Sandys, ex-Governor of Bengal&quot; encountered it while in India with the East India Company in the 1830s, and commissioned the local pharmacists (the partnership of John Wheeley Lea and William Perrins of 63 Broad Street, Worcester) to recreate it. However, neither Marcus Lord Sandys nor any Baron Sandys was ever a Governor of Bengal, nor as far as available records indicate had they ever visited India.

According to company lore, when the recipe was first mixed, the resulting product was so strong that it was considered inedible and the barrel was abandoned in the basement. Looking to make space in the storage area some 18 months later, the chemists decided to try it and discovered that the long-fermented sauce had mellowed and become palatable. In 1838, the first bottles of Lea &amp; Perrins Worcestershire sauce were released to the general public.

== Ingredients ==
The ingredients vary by manufacturer but often include vinegar, salt, a sweetener such as sugar or molasses, aromatics such as garlic, shallots, or onions, soy sauce, and fish or fish sauce. Some formulations may include tamarind, umeboshi or other pickles, chili peppers, citrus, or spices such as cloves.

Several anchovy-free vegetarian and vegan varieties are available for those who avoid or are allergic to fish. The &quot;Codex Alimentarius&quot; recommends that prepared food containing Worcestershire sauce with anchovies include a label warning of fish content, although this is not required in most jurisdictions. The US Department of Agriculture has required the recall of some products with undeclared Worcestershire sauce. Generally, Orthodox Jews refrain from eating fish and meat in the same dish, so they do not use traditional Worcestershire sauce to season meat. However, certain brands are certified to contain less than 1/60 of the fish product and can be used with meat.

Although soy sauce is used in many variations of Worcestershire sauce since the 1880s, it is debated whether Lea &amp; Perrins has ever used any in their preparation. According to William Shurtleff&#x27;s SoyInfo Center, a 1991 letter from factory general manager J. W. Garnett describes the brand switching to hydrolyzed vegetable protein during World War II due to shortages. As of 2021, soy is not declared as an ingredient in the Lea &amp; Perrins sauce.

==Varieties ==
=== Lea &amp; Perrins ===

The Lea &amp; Perrins brand was commercialised in 1837 and continues to be the leading global brand of Worcestershire sauce.

On 16 October 1897, Lea &amp; Perrins relocated manufacturing of the sauce from their pharmacy in Broad Street to a factory in the city of Worcester on Midland Road, where it is still made. The factory produces ready-mixed bottles for domestic distribution and a concentrate for bottling abroad.

In 1930, the Lea &amp; Perrins operation was purchased by HP Foods, which was in turn acquired by the Imperial Tobacco Company in 1967. HP was sold to Danone in 1988 and then to Heinz in 2005.

Some sizes of bottles sold by Lea &amp; Perrins in the United States come packaged in dark glass with a beige label and wrapped in paper. Lea &amp; Perrins USA explains this practice as a vestige of shipping practices from the 19th century, when the product was imported from England, as a measure of protection for the bottles. The producer also claims that its Worcestershire sauce is the oldest commercially bottled condiment in the U.S. The ingredients in the US version of Lea &amp; Perrins also differ somewhat, in that the US version (which include distilled white vinegar, molasses, sugar, water, salt, onions, anchovies, garlic, cloves, tamarind extract, natural flavorings, and chili pepper extract) replaces the malt vinegar used by the UK and Canadian versions with spirit vinegar.

=== Brazil and Portugal ===
In Brazil and Portugal, it is known as (&#x27;English sauce&#x27;).

=== Costa Rica ===
In Costa Rica, a local variation of the sauce is , created in 1920 and a staple condiment at homes and restaurants.

=== El Salvador ===
Worcestershire sauce, known as (&#x27;English sauce&#x27;) or (&#x27;Perrins sauce&#x27;), is very popular in El Salvador. Many restaurants provide a bottle on each table, and the per capita annual consumption is , the highest in the world as of 1996.

=== Germany ===
A sweeter, less salty version of the sauce called was developed in the beginning of the 20th century in Dresden, Germany, where it is still being produced. It contains smaller amounts of anchovies. It is mostly consumed in the eastern part of the country.

=== Mexico ===
In Mexico, it is known as (English sauce).

=== United Kingdom, Australia ===
Holbrook&#x27;s Worcestershire was produced in Birmingham, England, from 1875 but only the Australian subsidiary survives.

=== United States ===
Lea &amp; Perrins Worcestershire Sauce is sold in the United States by Kraft Heinz following the Kraft &amp; Heinz merger in 2015.

Other Worcestershire sauce brands in the United States include French&#x27;s, which was introduced in 1941.

=== Venezuela ===
It is commonly named (&#x27;English sauce&#x27;) and is part of many traditional dishes such as (a traditional Christmas dish) and some versions of .

=== Non-fish variations ===

Some &quot;Worcestershire sauces&quot; are inspired by the original sauce but have deviated significantly from the original taste profile, most notably by the exclusion of fish.
 () Worcestershire sauce has been produced since 1917. It relies on soy sauce instead of anchovies for the umami flavour. The company makes two versions: Formula 1 for Asian taste, and Formula 2 for international taste. The two differ only in that Formula 2 contains slightly less soy sauce and slightly more spices.

In Japan, Worcestershire sauce is labelled &quot;Worcester&quot; (rather than &quot;Worcestershire&quot;), rendered as . Many sauces are more of a vegetarian variety, with the base being water, syrup, vinegar, puree of apple and tomato puree, and the flavour less spicy and sweeter. Japanese Agricultural Standard defines Worcester-type sauces by viscosity, with Worcester sauce proper having a viscosity of less than 0.2 poiseuille, 0.2–2.0 poiseuille sauces categorised as , commonly used in Kantō region and northwards, and sauces over 2.0 poiseuille categorised as ; they are manufactured under brand names such as Otafuku and Bulldog, but these are brown sauces more similar to HP Sauce rather than Worcestershire sauce.

Tonkatsu sauce is a thicker Worcester-style sauce made from vegetables and fruits and associated with the dish .

Worcestershire sauce has a history of multiple introduction in Chinese-speaking areas. These sauces, each differently named, have diverged both from the original and from each other:

; Spicy soy sauce (), Shanghai
: Worcestershire sauce was first produced under this name in 1933 by Mailing Aquarius, then an English-owned company. With Mailing moving to Hong Kong in 1946, the Shanghai branch was nationalised in 1954. Sauce production was transferred to Taikang in 1960. The sauce was reformulated in 1981 under a &quot;nine flavours in one&quot; formula, and again changed in 1990 into two &quot;Taikang Yellow&quot; and &quot;Taikang Blue&quot; varieties. As of 2020, only the yellow variety remains available.
: The Taikang Yellow sauce contains no fish. It is used in Haipai cuisine, especially on pork chops and Shanghainese borscht.
: A descendant of an earlier form of the sauce is found in Taiwan as &quot;Mailing spicy soy sauce&quot;, originally produced by the HK branch of Mailing. It is found in steakhouses.
; Gip-sauce (), Hong Kong
: This variety is of uncertain etymology: it may have come from &quot;catsup&quot; or the verb &quot;give&quot;. Save for the Lea &amp; Perrins original sold as a gip-sauce, most varieties of this type have a stronger umami flavour with the addition of soy sauce, fish sauce, and/or MSG; some commercial varieties forgo fish altogether. This sauce is commonly used in dim sum dishes such as steamed meatball and spring rolls.
; Spicy vinegar (), Taiwan
: This variety is descended from the Japanese Worcester Sauce via the Kongyen company, originally founded by Japanese businesspeople. It is also known under the name &quot;Taiwan Black Vinegar&quot; due to confusion post-WW2.

<text>The Westminster system, or Westminster model, is a type of parliamentary government that incorporates a series of procedures for operating a legislature, first developed in England. Key aspects of the system include an executive branch made up of members of the legislature which is responsible to the legislature; the presence of parliamentary opposition parties; and a ceremonial head of state who is separate from the head of government. The term derives from the Palace of Westminster, which has been the seat of the Westminster Parliament in England and later the United Kingdom since the 13th century. The Westminster system is often contrasted with the presidential system that originated in the United States, or with the semi-presidential system, based on the government of France.

The Westminster system is used, or was once used, in the national and subnational legislatures of most former colonies of the British Empire, upon gaining self-government (with the exception of the United States and Cyprus), beginning with the first of the Canadian provinces in 1848 and the six Australian colonies between 1855 and 1890. It is the form of government bequeathed to New Zealand, and former British Hong Kong. Israel adopted a largely Westminster-inspired system of government upon declaring independence from the British Mandate of Palestine. However, some former colonies have since adopted either the presidential system (Nigeria for example) or a hybrid system (like South Africa) as their form of government.

==Characteristics==
The Westminster system of government may include some of the following features:

* A sovereign or head of state who functions as the nominal or legal and constitutional holder of executive power, and holds numerous reserve powers, but whose daily duties mainly consist of performing ceremonial functions. Examples include King Charles III, the governors-general in the Commonwealth realms, or the presidents of many countries, and state or provincial governors in federal systems. Exceptions to this are Ireland and Israel, whose presidents are de jure and de facto ceremonial, and the latter possesses no reserve powers whatsoever.
* A head of government (or head of the executive), known as the prime minister (PM), premier, chief minister or first minister. While the head of state appoints the head of government, constitutional convention suggests that a majority of elected members of parliament must support the person appointed. If more than half of elected parliamentarians belong to the same political party, then the parliamentary leader of that party typically is appointed.
* An executive branch led by the head of government usually made up of members of the legislature with the senior members of the executive in a cabinet adhering to the principle of cabinet collective responsibility; such members wields authority on behalf of the nominal or theoretical executive.
* An independent, non-partisan civil service that advises on, and implements, decisions of the elected government. Civil servants hold permanent appointments and can expect merit-based selection processes and continuity of employment when governments change.
* A parliamentary opposition (in a multi-party system) with an official leader of the opposition, which generally takes on an adversarial role, presenting arguments against the government&#x27;s policies. In certain countries, the leader of the opposition is expected to be ready to form a government if the office of head of government becomes vacant.
* A legislature, often bicameral, with at least one elected house—although unicameral systems also exist. Traditionally, the lower house is elected using first-past-the-post from single-member districts, which is still more common, although some use a system of proportional representation (e.g. Israel, New Zealand, Denmark), parallel voting (e.g. Japan, Italy), or preferential voting (e.g. Papua New Guinea, Australia).
* A lower house of parliament with an ability to dismiss a government by &quot;withholding (or blocking) supply&quot; (rejecting a budget), passing a motion of no confidence, or defeating a confidence motion.
* A parliament that can be dissolved and snap elections called at any time.
* Parliamentary privilege, which allows the legislature to discuss any issue it deems relevant without fear of consequences stemming from defamatory statements or records thereof.
* Minutes of meetings, often known as Hansard, including an ability for the legislature to strike discussion from these minutes.
* The ability of courts to address silence or ambiguity in the statutory law through the development of common law. Another parallel system of legal principles also exists known as equity. Exceptions to this include India, Quebec in Canada, and Scotland in the UK, among other countries who mix common law with other legal systems.

Most of the procedures of the Westminster system originated with the conventions, practices, and precedents of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, which form a part of what is known as the Constitution of the United Kingdom. Unlike the uncodified British constitution, most countries that use the Westminster system have codified the system, at least in part, in a written constitution.

However, uncodified conventions, practices, and precedents continue to play a significant role in most countries, as many constitutions do not specify important elements of procedure. For example, some older constitutions using the Westminster system do not mention the existence of the cabinet or the prime minister, because these offices were taken for granted by the authors of these constitutions. Sometimes these conventions, reserve powers, and other influences collide in times of crisis and in such times the weaknesses of the unwritten aspects of the Westminster system, as well as the strengths of the Westminster system&#x27;s flexibility, are put to the test. As an illustrative example, in the Australian constitutional crisis of 1975, the Governor-General of Australia, Sir John Kerr, dismissed Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and replaced him with opposition leader Malcolm Fraser.

=== Summary of the typical structure of the Westminster model ===

==Operation==
The pattern of executive functions within a Westminster system is quite complex. In essence, the head of state, usually a monarch or president, is a ceremonial figurehead who is the theoretical, nominal or source of executive power within the system. In practice, such a figure does not actively exercise executive powers, even though executive authority is nominally exercised in their name.

The head of government, usually called the prime minister or premier, will ideally have the support of a majority in the responsible house, and must, in any case, be able to ensure the existence of no absolute majority against the government. If the parliament passes a motion of no confidence, or refuses to pass an important bill such as the budget, then the government must either resign so that a different government can be appointed or seek a parliamentary dissolution so that new general elections may be held in order to re-confirm or deny the government&#x27;s mandate.

Executive authority within a Westminster system is de jure exercised by the cabinet as a whole, along with more junior ministers, however, in effect, the head of government dominates the executive as the head of government is ultimately the person from whom the head of state will take advice (by constitutional convention) on the exercise of executive power, including the appointment and dismissal of cabinet members. This results in the situation where individual cabinet members in effect serve at the pleasure of the prime minister. Thus the cabinet is strongly subordinate to the prime minister as they can be replaced at any time, or can be moved (&quot;demoted&quot;) to a different portfolio in a cabinet reshuffle for &quot;underperforming&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, the sovereign theoretically holds executive authority, even though the prime minister and the cabinet effectively implement executive powers. In a parliamentary republic like India, the president is the executive, even though executive powers are essentially instituted by the prime minister and the Council of Ministers. In Israel, however, executive power is vested and in the cabinet and the president is and a ceremonial figurehead.

As an example, the prime minister and cabinet (as the &quot;de facto&quot; executive body in the system) generally must seek the permission of the head of state when carrying out executive functions. If, for instance the British prime minister wished to dissolve Parliament in order for a general election to take place, the prime minister is constitutionally bound to request permission from the sovereign in order to attain such a wish. However, the sovereign in modern times has virtually always followed the advice of their prime minister without their own agency, this owes to the fact that the British sovereign is a constitutional monarch; he or she abides by the advice of his or her ministers, except when executing reserve powers in times of crisis. The sovereign&#x27;s power to appoint and dismiss governments, appoint cabinet ministers to serve in the government, appoint diplomats, declare war, and to sign treaties (among other powers de jure held by the sovereign) is known as the royal prerogative, which in modern times is exercised by the sovereign solely on the advice of the Prime Minister.

This custom also occurs in other countries are regions around the world using the Westminster System, as a legacy of British colonial rule. In Commonwealth realms such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the day-to-day functions that would be exercised by the sovereign personally in the United Kingdom are instead exercised by the governor-general. In such nations, the prime minister is obligated to formally seek permission from the governor-general when implementing executive decisions, in a manner similar to the British system.

An analogous scenario also exists in republics in the Commonwealth of Nations, such as India or Trinidad and Tobago, where there is a president who functions similarly to a governor-general.

An unusual case lies in Israel and Japan, where the respective prime ministers have the full legal power to implement executive decisions, and presidential (in Israel) or imperial (in Japan) approval is not required; the prime ministers of these nations are fully the &quot;de jure&quot; source of executive authority, and not the head of state.

The head of state will often hold meetings with the head of government and cabinet, as a means of keeping abreast of governmental policy and as a means of advising, consulting and warning ministers in their actions. Such a practice takes place in the United Kingdom and India. In the UK, the sovereign holds confidential weekly meetings with the prime minister to discuss governmental policy and to offer his or her opinions and advice on issues of the day. In India, the prime minister is constitutionally bound to hold regular sessions with the president, in a similar manner to the aforementioned British practice. In essence, the head of state, as the theoretical executive authority, &quot;reigns but does not rule&quot;. This phrase means that the head of state&#x27;s role in government is generally ceremonial and as a result does not directly institute executive powers. The reserve powers of the head of state are sufficient to ensure compliance with some of their wishes. However, the extent of such powers varies from one country to another and is often a matter of controversy.

Such an executive arrangement first emerged in the United Kingdom. Historically, the British sovereign held and directly exercised all executive authority. George I of Great Britain (reigned 1714 to 1727) was the first British monarch to delegate some executive powers to a prime minister and a cabinet of the ministers, largely because he was also the monarch of Hanover in Germany and did not speak English fluently. Over time, further arrangements continued to allow the execution of executive authority on the sovereign&#x27;s behalf and more and more de facto power ended up lying in the Prime Minister&#x27;s hands. Such a concept was reinforced in &quot;The English Constitution&quot; (1876) by Walter Bagehot, who distinguished between the separate &quot;dignified&quot; and &quot;efficient&quot; functions of government. The sovereign should be a focal point for the nation (&quot;dignified&quot;), while the PM and cabinet actually undertook executive decisions (&quot;efficient&quot;).

== Electoral system, ministers and officials ==
The electoral system is often set out in a Representation of the People Act. Common ministerial titles include parliamentary secretary and under-secretary. Ministers are supported by private secretaries and government departments are run by permanent secretaries, principal secretaries or chief secretaries.

==Role of the head of state==
The head of state or their representative (such as a governor-general) formally appoints as the head of government whoever commands the confidence of the lower or sole house of the legislature and invites him or her to form a government. In the UK, this is known as kissing hands. Although the dissolution of the legislature and the call for new elections is formally performed by the head of state, the head of state, by convention, acts according to the wishes of the head of government.

A president, monarch, or governor-general might possess clearly significant reserve powers. Examples of the use of such powers include the Australian constitutional crisis of 1975 and the Canadian King–Byng affair in 1926. The Lascelles Principles were an attempt to create a convention to cover similar situations, but have not been tested in practice. Because of differences in their written constitutions, the formal powers of monarchs, governors-general, and presidents vary greatly from one country to another. However, as sovereigns and governors-general are not elected, and some presidents may not be directly elected by the people, they are often shielded from any public disapproval stemming from unilateral or controversial use of their powers.

In many Commonwealth realms a governor-general formally represents the monarch, who is usually absent from the realm. In such countries, the identity of the &quot;head of state&quot; may be unclear.

==Cabinet government==

In the book &quot;The English Constitution&quot;, Walter Bagehot emphasised the divide of the constitution into two components, the Dignified (that part which is symbolic) and the Efficient (the way things actually work and get done), and called the Efficient &quot;Cabinet Government&quot;.

Members of the Cabinet are collectively seen as responsible for government policy, a policy termed cabinet collective responsibility. All Cabinet decisions are made by consensus, a vote is rarely taken in a Cabinet meeting. All ministers, whether senior and in the Cabinet, or junior ministers, must support the policy of the government publicly regardless of any private reservations. When a Cabinet reshuffle is imminent, a lot of time is taken up in the conversations of politicians and in the news media, speculating on who will, or will not, be moved in and out of the Cabinet by the Prime Minister, because the appointment of ministers to the Cabinet, and threat of dismissal from the Cabinet, is the single most powerful constitutional power which a Prime Minister has in the political control of the Government in the Westminster system.

The Official Opposition and other major political parties not in the Government, will mirror the governmental organisation with their own Shadow cabinet made up of Shadow Ministers.

==Bicameral and unicameral parliaments==


In a Westminster system, some members of parliament are elected by popular vote, while others are appointed. Nearly all Westminster-based parliaments have a lower house with powers based on those of the House of Commons (under various names), comprising local, elected representatives of the people (with the only exception being elected entirely by nationwide Proportional Representation). Most also have a smaller upper house, which is made up of members chosen by various methods:
* Termless appointees, either lifetime or retiring, from successive prime ministers (such as the Senate of Canada)
* Appointees of the premier and the opposition leader (such as the Jamaican Senate)
* Direct election (such as the Australian Senate)
* Election by electoral colleges or sub-national legislatures (such as the Indian Rajya Sabha)
* Hereditary nobility (such as the British House of Lords until the House of Lords Act 1999)
* Any combination of the above (such as the Malaysian Senate)

* A prime minister can be elected without gaining a majority of the popular vote.

In the UK, the lower house is the legislative body, while the upper house practices restraint in exercising its constitutional powers and serves as a consultative body. In other Westminster countries, however, the upper house can sometimes exercise considerable power, as is the case for the Australian Senate.

Some Westminster-derived parliaments are unicameral for two reasons:

* The New Zealand Parliament, Parliament of Queensland, and the parliaments of the Canadian provinces of Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Quebec have abolished their upper houses.
* The parliaments of all other Canadian provinces, the Parliament of Malta, the Papua New Guinea Parliament, the Legislative Council of Hong Kong and the Israeli Parliament never had upper houses.

Hong Kong, a former British crown colony and currently a special administrative region of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, has a unicameral Legislative Council. While the Legislative Councils in British Australasian and North American colonies were unelected upper houses and some of them had since abolished themselves, the Legislative Council of Hong Kong has remained the sole chamber and had in 1995 evolved into a fully elected house, yet only part of the seats are returned by universal suffrage. Responsible government was never granted during British colonial rule, and the Governor remained the head of government until the transfer of sovereignty in 1997, when the role was replaced by the Chief Executive. Secretaries had remained to be chosen by the Chief Executive not from the Legislative Council, and their appointments need not be approved by the Legislative Council. Although essentially more presidential than parliamentary, the Legislative Council had inherited many elements of the Westminster system, including parliamentary powers, privileges and immunity, and the right to conduct inquiries, amongst others. Minutes are known as Hansards, and the theme colour of the meeting chamber is red as in other upper houses. Government secretaries and other officials are seated on the right hand side of the President in the chamber. The Chief Executive may dissolve the Legislative Council under certain conditions, and is obliged to resign, e.g., when a re-elected Legislative Council passes again a bill that he or she had refused to sign.

== &quot;Washminster system&quot; ==
Australian constitutional law is, in many respects, a unique hybrid with influences from the United States Constitution as well as from the traditions and conventions of the Westminster system and some indigenous features. Australia is exceptional because the government faces a fully elected upper house, the Senate, which must be willing to pass all its legislation. Although government is formed in the lower house, the House of Representatives, the support of the Senate is necessary in order to govern.

The Australian Senate is unusual in that it maintains an ability to withhold supply from the government of the day – a power similar to that held in the UK until 1911 by the House of Lords, which has since then been impossible, in the Westminster system. A government that has lost supply is severely restricted in its abilities to act; unless a solution can be negotiated and supply can be restored, such an occurrence would normally trigger a federal election. Since the governor-general, technically speaking, can dismiss a federal government at any time, loss of supply is sometimes, controversially, considered a suitable trigger for a dismissal (such as with the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis). This is controversial because it conflicts with the Westminster tradition of government by a party with the confidence of the lower house (not an upper house like the Senate). Some political scientists have held that the Australian system of government was consciously devised as a blend or hybrid of the Westminster and the United States systems of government, especially since the Australian Senate is a powerful upper house like the US Senate; this notion is expressed in the nickname &quot;the Washminster mutation&quot;. The ability of upper houses to block supply also features in the parliaments of most Australian states.

The Australian system has also been referred to as a semi-parliamentary system.

==Ceremonies==
The Westminster system has a very distinct appearance when functioning, with many British customs incorporated into day-to-day government function. A Westminster-style parliament is usually a long, rectangular room, with two rows of seats and desks on either side. Many chambers connect the opposing rows, either with a perpendicular row of seats and desks at the furthermost point from the Speaker&#x27;s Chair at the opposite end of the chamber (e.g. UK House of Lords or Israel Knesset) or the rows of chairs and desks are rounded at the end, opposite to the Speaker&#x27;s Chair (e.g. Australian chambers, Ireland, South Africa, India). The chairs in which both the government and opposition sit, are positioned so that the two rows are facing each other. This arrangement is said to have derived from an early Parliament which was held in a church choir. Traditionally, the opposition parties will sit in one row of seats, and the government party will sit in the other. In some countries, the mace will face the government’s side whilst lying on the table of the House. In most majority governments, the number of government-party MPs is so large that it must use the &quot;opposition&quot; seats as well. In the lower house at Westminster (the UK&#x27;s House of Commons) there are lines on the floor in front of the government and opposition benches that members may cross only when exiting the chamber. 

At one end of the room sits a large chair, for the Speaker of the House. The speaker usually wears black robes, and in some countries, a wig. Robed parliamentary clerks often sit at narrow tables between the two rows of seats, as well. These narrow tables in the centre of the chamber, is usually where ministers or members of the house come to speak. A newly elected Speaker is symbolically dragged to the Chair upon being elected. 

Other ceremonies sometimes associated with the Westminster system include an annual Speech from the Throne (or equivalent thereof) in which the head of state gives a special address (written by the government) to parliament about what kind of policies to expect in the coming year, and lengthy State Opening of Parliament ceremonies that often involve the presentation of a large ceremonial mace. Some legislatures retain Westminster&#x27;s colour-coded chambers, with the upper houses associated with the colour red (after the House of Lords) and the lower with green (after the House of Commons). This is the case in India, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Barbados.

==Current countries==
Countries that use variations on the theme of the Westminster system, as of 2023, include the following:

==Former countries==
The Westminster system was adopted by a number of countries which subsequently evolved or reformed their system of government departing from the original model. In some cases, certain aspects of the Westminster system were retained or codified in their constitutions. For instance South Africa and Botswana, unlike Commonwealth realms or parliamentary republics such as India, have a combined head of state and head of government but the President remains responsible to the lower house of parliament; it elects the President at the beginning of a new Parliament, or when there is a vacancy in the office, or when the sitting President is defeated on a vote of confidence. If the Parliament cannot elect a new President within a short period of time (a week to a month) the lower house is dissolved and new elections are called.

<text>Wernher Magnus Maximilian Freiherr von Braun ( , ; 23 March 191216 June 1977) was a German-American aerospace engineer and space architect. He was a member of the Nazi Party and &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot;, the leading figure in the development of rocket technology in Nazi Germany, and later a pioneer of rocket and space technology in the United States.

As a young man, von Braun worked in Nazi Germany&#x27;s rocket development program. He helped design and co-developed the V-2 rocket at Peenemünde during World War II. The V-2 became the first artificial object to travel into space on 20 June 1944. Following the war, he was secretly moved to the United States, along with about 1,600 other German scientists, engineers, and technicians, as part of Operation Paperclip. He worked for the United States Army on an intermediate-range ballistic missile program, and he developed the rockets that launched the United States&#x27; first space satellite Explorer 1 in 1958. He worked with Walt Disney on a series of films, which popularized the idea of human space travel in the U.S. and beyond from 1955 to 1957.

In 1960, his group was assimilated into NASA, where he served as director of the newly formed Marshall Space Flight Center and as the chief architect of the Saturn V super heavy-lift launch vehicle that propelled the Apollo spacecraft to the Moon. In 1967, von Braun was inducted into the National Academy of Engineering, and in 1975, he received the National Medal of Science.

Von Braun is a highly controversial figure widely seen as escaping justice for his awareness of Nazi war crimes due to the Americans&#x27; desire to beat the Soviets in the Cold War. He is also sometimes described by others as the &quot;father of space travel&quot;, the &quot;father of rocket science&quot;, or the &quot;father of the American lunar program&quot;. He advocated a human mission to Mars.

==Early life==
Wernher von Braun was born on 23 March 1912, in the small town of Wirsitz in the Province of Posen, Kingdom of Prussia, then German Empire and now Poland.

His father, Magnus Freiherr von Braun (1878–1972), was a civil servant and conservative politician; he served as Minister of Agriculture in the federal government during the Weimar Republic. His mother, Emmy von Quistorp (1886–1959), traced her ancestry through both parents to medieval European royalty and was a descendant of Philip III of France, Valdemar I of Denmark, Robert III of Scotland, and Edward III of England. He had an older brother, the West German diplomat Sigismund von Braun, who served as Secretary of State in the Foreign Office in the 1970s, and a younger brother, Magnus von Braun, who was a rocket scientist and later a senior executive with Chrysler.

The family moved to Berlin, Brandenburg, in 1915, where his father worked at the Ministry of the Interior. After his Confirmation, his mother gave him a telescope, and he developed a passion for astronomy. Von Braun learned to play both the cello and the piano at an early age and at one time wanted to become a composer. He took lessons from the composer Paul Hindemith. The few pieces of von Braun&#x27;s youthful compositions that exist are reminiscent of Hindemith&#x27;s style. He could play piano pieces of Beethoven and Bach from memory. Beginning in 1925, he attended a boarding school at Ettersburg Castle near Weimar, Free State of Thuringia, where he did not do well in physics and mathematics. There he acquired a copy of &quot;Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen&quot; (1923, &quot;By Rocket into Planetary Space&quot;) by rocket pioneer Hermann Oberth. In 1928, his parents moved him to the Hermann-Lietz-Internat (also a residential school) on the East Frisian North Sea island of Spiekeroog. Space travel had always fascinated him, and from then on he applied himself to physics and mathematics to pursue his interest in rocket engineering.

In 1928 the &quot;Raketenrummel&quot; or &quot;Rocket Rumble&quot; fad initiated by Fritz von Opel and Max Valier was highly influential on von Braun as a teenage space enthusiast. He was so enthusiastic after seeing one of the public Opel-RAK rocket car demonstrations, that he constructed his own homemade toy rocket car and caused a disruption in a crowded sidewalk by launching the toy wagon, to which he had attached the largest firework rockets he could purchase. He was later taken in for questioning by the local police, until released to his father for disciplinary action. The incident highlighted the young von Braun&#x27;s determination to &quot;dedicate his life to space travel&quot;.

In 1930, von Braun attended the Technische Hochschule Berlin, where he joined the Spaceflight Society (Verein für Raumschiffahrt or VfR), co-founded by Valier, and worked with Willy Ley in his liquid-fueled rocket motor tests in conjunction with others such as Rolf Engel, Rudolf Nebel, Hermann Oberth or Paul Ehmayr. In spring 1932, he graduated with a diploma in mechanical engineering. His early exposure to rocketry convinced him that the exploration of space would require far more than applications of the current engineering technology. Wanting to learn more about physics, chemistry, and astronomy, von Braun entered the Friedrich-Wilhelm University of Berlin for doctoral studies and graduated with a doctorate in physics in 1934. He also studied at ETH Zürich for a term from June to October 1931.

==German career==
In 1930, von Braun attended a presentation given by Auguste Piccard. After the talk, the young student approached the famous pioneer of high-altitude balloon flight, and stated to him: &quot;You know, I plan on traveling to the Moon at some time.&quot; Piccard is said to have responded with encouraging words.

Von Braun was greatly influenced by Oberth, of whom he said:

According to historian Norman Davies, von Braun was able to pursue a career as a rocket scientist in Germany due to a &quot;curious oversight&quot; in the Treaty of Versailles which did not include rocketry in its list of weapons forbidden to Germany.

===Involvement with the Nazi regime===
====Nazi Party membership====
Von Braun was an opportunist who joined the Nazi Party to continue his work on rockets for Nazi Germany. He applied for membership in the Party on 12 November 1937, and was issued membership number 5,738,692.

Michael J. Neufeld, an author of aerospace history and chief of the Space History Division at the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum, wrote that ten years after von Braun obtained his Nazi Party membership, he signed an affidavit for the U.S. Army, though he stated the incorrect year:

It has not been ascertained whether von Braun&#x27;s error with regard to the year was deliberate or a simple mistake. Neufeld wrote:

Von Braun&#x27;s later attitude toward the Nazi regime of the late 1930s and early 1940s was complex. He said that he had been so influenced by the early Nazi promise of release from the post–World War I economic effects, that his patriotic feelings had increased. In a 1952 memoir article he admitted that, at that time, he &quot;fared relatively rather well under totalitarianism&quot;. Yet, he also wrote that &quot;to us, Hitler was still only a pompous fool with a Charlie Chaplin moustache&quot; and that he perceived him as &quot;another Napoleon&quot; who was &quot;wholly without scruples, a godless man who thought himself the only god&quot;.

Later examination of von Braun&#x27;s background, conducted by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation, suggests that his background check file contained no derogatory information pertaining to his involvement in the party, but it was found that he had numerous letters of commendation for outstanding performance of duties during his time working under the Nazi party. Overall FBI conclusions point to von Braun&#x27;s involvement in the Nazi Party to be purely for the advancement of his academic career, or out of fear of imprisonment or execution.

====Membership in the &quot;Allgemeine-SS&quot;====
Von Braun joined the SS horseback riding school on 1 November 1933 as an &quot;SS-Anwärter&quot;. He left the following year. In 1940, von Braun joined the SS and was given the rank of &quot;Untersturmführer&quot; in the &quot;Allgemeine-SS&quot; and issued membership number 185,068. In 1947, he gave the U.S. War Department this explanation:

When shown a picture of himself standing behind Himmler, von Braun said that he had only worn the SS uniform that one time, but in 2002 a former SS officer at Peenemünde told the BBC that von Braun had regularly worn the SS uniform to official meetings. He began as an &quot;Untersturmführer&quot; (Second lieutenant) and was promoted three times by Himmler, the last time in June 1943 to SS-&quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; (Major). Von Braun later stated that these were simply technical promotions received each year regularly by mail.

===Work under Nazi regime===
In 1932, von Braun received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Mechanical Engineering from Technische Hochschule Berlin (now Technische Universität Berlin), Germany. During a period in 1931, von Braun attended the ETH Zürich in Switzerland. During this time in Switzerland, von Braun assisted Professor Hermann Oberth in writing a book concerning the possibilities of creating and manufacturing liquid-propellant rockets. Shortly after this, von Braun founded his own private rocket development business in Berlin, and through which he made the first rocket fired by gasoline and liquid oxygen.

In 1932, having caught wind of von Braun&#x27;s rocket business, the German Army connected with von Braun to pursue basic missile research and weather data experimentation. Von Braun said that the German government financed the development of test stands and facilities for experimentation in Darmstadt, Germany. In 1939, von Braun was appointed a technical advisor at Peenemünde Army Research Center on the Baltic Sea.

In 1933, von Braun was working on his creative doctorate when the Nazi Party came to power in a coalition government in Germany; rocketry was almost immediately moved onto the national agenda. An artillery captain, Walter Dornberger, arranged an Ordnance Department research grant for von Braun, who then worked next to Dornberger&#x27;s existing solid-fuel rocket test site at Kummersdorf.

Von Braun received his doctorate in physics (aerospace engineering) on 27 July 1934, from the University of Berlin for a thesis titled &quot;About Combustion Tests.&quot; His doctoral supervisor was Erich Schumann. However, this thesis represented only the public aspect of von Braun&#x27;s work. His actual thesis, entitled &quot;Construction, Theoretical, and Experimental Solution to the Problem of the Liquid Propellant Rocket&quot; (dated 16 April 1934), detailed the construction and design of the A2 rocket. It remained classified by the German army until its publication in 1960. By the end of 1934, his group had successfully launched two liquid fuel A2 rockets that rose to heights of 2.2 and .

Von Braun continued his guided missile work throughout World War Two, and met with Adolf Hitler on several occasions, being formally decorated by Hitler twice, including being awarded the Iron Cross.

At the time, Germany was highly interested in American physicist Robert H. Goddard&#x27;s research. Before 1939, German scientists occasionally contacted Goddard directly with technical questions. Von Braun used Goddard&#x27;s plans from various journals and incorporated them into the building of the &quot;Aggregat&quot; (A) series of rockets. The first successful launch of an A-4 took place on 3 October 1942. The A-4 rocket became well known as the V-2. In 1963, von Braun reflected on the history of rocketry, and said of Goddard&#x27;s work: &quot;His rockets ... may have been rather crude by present-day standards, but they blazed the trail and incorporated many features used in our most modern rockets and space vehicles.&quot;

Goddard confirmed his work was used by von Braun in 1944, shortly before the Nazis began firing V-2s at England. A V-2 crashed in Sweden and some parts were sent to an Annapolis lab where Goddard was doing research for the Navy. If this was the so-called Bäckebo Bomb, it had been procured by the British in exchange for Spitfires; Annapolis would have received some parts from them. Goddard is reported to have recognized components he had invented and inferred that his brainchild had been turned into a weapon. Later, von Braun said: &quot;I have very deep and sincere regret for the victims of the V-2 rockets, but there were victims on both sides...A war is a war, and when my country is at war, my duty is to help win that war.&quot;

In response to Goddard&#x27;s statements, von Braun said &quot;at no time in Germany did I or any of my associates ever see a Goddard patent&quot;. This was independently confirmed. He wrote that statements that he had lifted Goddard&#x27;s work were the furthest from the truth, noting that Goddard&#x27;s paper &quot;A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes&quot;, which was studied by von Braun and Oberth, lacked the specificity of liquid-fuel experimentation with rockets. It was also confirmed that he was responsible for an estimated 20 patentable innovations related to rocketry, as well as receiving U.S. patents after the war concerning the advancement of rocketry. Documented accounts also stated he provided solutions to a host of aerospace engineering problems in the 1950s and 1960s.

On 22 December 1942, Adolf Hitler ordered the production of the A-4 as a &quot;vengeance weapon&quot;, and the Peenemünde group developed it to target London. Following von Braun&#x27;s 7 July 1943 presentation of a color movie showing an A-4 taking off, Hitler was so enthusiastic that he personally made von Braun a professor shortly thereafter.

By that time, the British and Soviet intelligence agencies were aware of the rocket program and von Braun&#x27;s team at Peenemünde, based on the intelligence provided by the Polish underground Home Army. Over the nights of 17–18 August 1943, RAF Bomber Command&#x27;s Operation Hydra dispatched raids on the Peenemünde camp consisting of 596 aircraft, and dropped 1,800 tons of explosives. The facility was salvaged and most of the engineering team remained unharmed; however, the raids killed von Braun&#x27;s engine designer Walter Thiel and Chief Engineer Walther, and the rocket program was delayed.

The V-2 became the first artificial object to travel into space by crossing the Kármán line with the vertical launch of MW 18014 on 20 June 1944.

The first combat A-4, renamed the V-2 (&quot;Vergeltungswaffe 2&quot; &quot;Retaliation/Vengeance Weapon 2&quot;) for propaganda purposes, was launched toward England on 7 September 1944, only 21 months after the project had been officially commissioned. Doug Millard of the Science Museum, London states:

===Experiments with rocket aircraft===
In 1936, von Braun&#x27;s rocketry team working at Kummersdorf investigated installing liquid-fuelled rockets in aircraft. Ernst Heinkel enthusiastically supported their efforts, supplying a He-72 and later two He-112s for the experiments. Later in 1936, Erich Warsitz was seconded by the RLM to von Braun and Heinkel, because he had been recognized as one of the most experienced test pilots of the time, and because he also had an extraordinary fund of technical knowledge. After he familiarized Warsitz with a test-stand run, showing him the corresponding apparatus in the aircraft, he asked: &quot;Are you with us and will you test the rocket in the air? Then, Warsitz, you will be a famous man. And later we will fly to the Moon – with you at the helm!&quot;

In June 1937, at Neuhardenberg (a large field about east of Berlin, listed as a reserve airfield in the event of war), one of these latter aircraft was flown with its piston engine shut down during flight by Warsitz, at which time it was propelled by von Braun&#x27;s rocket power alone. Despite a wheels-up landing and the fuselage having been on fire, it proved to official circles that an aircraft could be flown satisfactorily with a back-thrust system through the rear.

At the same time, Hellmuth Walter&#x27;s experiments into hydrogen peroxide based rockets were leading toward light and simple rockets that appeared well-suited for aircraft installation. Also, the firm of Hellmuth Walter at Kiel had been commissioned by the RLM to build a rocket engine for the He-112, so there were two different new rocket motor designs at Neuhardenberg: whereas von Braun&#x27;s engines were powered by alcohol and liquid oxygen, Walter engines had hydrogen peroxide and calcium permanganate as a catalyst. Von Braun&#x27;s engines used direct combustion and created fire, while the Walter devices used hot vapors from a chemical reaction, but both created thrust and provided high speed. The subsequent flights with the He-112 used the Walter-rocket instead of von Braun&#x27;s; it was more reliable, simpler to operate, and safer for the test pilot, Warsitz.

===Slave labor===
SS General Hans Kammler, who as an engineer had constructed several concentration camps, including Auschwitz, had a reputation for brutality and had conceived the idea of using concentration camp prisoners as slave laborers in the rocket program. Arthur Rudolph, chief engineer of the V-2 rocket factory at Peenemünde, endorsed this idea in April 1943 when a labor shortage developed. More people died building the V-2 rockets than were killed by it as a weapon. Von Braun admitted visiting the plant at Mittelwerk on many occasions, and called conditions at the plant &quot;repulsive&quot;, but stated that he had never personally witnessed any deaths or beatings, although it had become clear to him by 1944 that deaths had occurred. He denied ever having visited the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp, where 20,000 died from illness, beatings, hangings, and intolerable working conditions.

Some prisoners state that von Braun engaged in brutal treatment or approved of it. Guy Morand, a French resistance fighter who was a prisoner in Dora, testified in 1995 that, after an apparent sabotage attempt, von Braun ordered a prisoner to be flogged, while Robert Cazabonne, another French prisoner, stated that von Braun stood by as prisoners were hanged by chains suspended by cranes. However, these accounts may have been a case of mistaken identity. Former Buchenwald inmate Adam Cabala stated that von Braun went to the concentration camp to pick slave laborers:

Von Braun later stated that he was aware of the treatment of prisoners, but felt helpless to change the situation. When asked if von Braun could have protested against the brutal treatment of the slave laborers, von Braun team member Konrad Dannenberg (a member of the Nazi party since 1932) told &quot;The Huntsville Times&quot;: &quot;If he had done it, in my opinion, he would have been shot on the spot.&quot;

===Arrest and release by the Nazi regime===
According to André Sellier, a French historian and survivor of the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp, Heinrich Himmler had von Braun come to his Feldkommandostelle Hochwald HQ in East Prussia in February 1944. To increase his power-base within the Nazi regime, Himmler was conspiring to use Kammler to gain control of all German armament programs, including the V-2 program at Peenemünde. He therefore recommended that von Braun work more closely with Kammler to solve the problems of the V-2. Von Braun stated that he replied that the problems were merely technical and he was confident that they would be solved with Dornberger&#x27;s assistance.

Von Braun had been under SD surveillance since October 1943. A secret report stated that he and his colleagues Klaus Riedel and Helmut Gröttrup were said to have expressed regret at an engineer&#x27;s house one evening in early March 1944 that they were not working on a spaceship and that they felt the war was not going well; this was considered a &quot;defeatist&quot; attitude. A young female dentist who was an SS spy reported their comments. Himmler&#x27;s unfounded allegations branding von Braun and his colleagues as communist sympathizers and accusing them of sabotaging the V-2 program, coupled with von Braun&#x27;s regular piloting of a government-provided airplane that could facilitate an escape to Britain, led to their arrest by the Gestapo.

The unsuspecting von Braun was detained on 14 March (or 15 March), 1944, and was taken to a Gestapo cell in Stettin (now Szczecin, Poland). where he was held for two weeks without knowing the charges against him.

Through Major Hans Georg Klamroth, in charge of the Abwehr for Peenemünde, Dornberger obtained von Braun&#x27;s conditional release and Albert Speer, Reichsminister for Munitions and War Production, persuaded Hitler to reinstate von Braun so that the V-2 program could continue or turn into a &quot;V-4 program&quot; (the Rheinbote as a short-range ballistic rocket) which in their view would be impossible without von Braun&#x27;s leadership. In his memoirs, Speer states Hitler had finally conceded that von Braun was to be &quot;protected from all prosecution as long as he is indispensable, difficult though the general consequences arising from the situation.&quot;

Upon investigation by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation on 1 May 1961 advised that &quot;there was no record of an arrest in their respective files&quot; suggesting that Von Braun&#x27;s imprisonment was wiped from German prison records at a point after his conditional release or after the Nazi regime had fallen.

===Surrender to the Americans===
The Soviet Army was about from Peenemünde in early 1945 when von Braun assembled his planning staff and asked them to decide how and to whom they should surrender. Unwilling to go to the Soviets, von Braun and his staff decided to try to surrender to the Americans. Kammler had ordered the relocation of his team to central Germany; however, a conflicting order from an army chief ordered them to join the army and fight. Deciding that Kammler&#x27;s order was their best bet to defect to the Americans, von Braun fabricated documents and transported 500 of his affiliates to the area around Mittelwerk, where they resumed their work in Bleicherode and surrounding towns after the middle of February 1945. For fear of their documents being destroyed by the SS, von Braun ordered the blueprints to be hidden in an abandoned iron mine in the Harz mountain range near Goslar. The U.S. Army Counter Intelligence Corps managed to unveil the location after lengthy interrogations of von Braun, Walter Dornberger, Bernhard Tessmann and Dieter Huzel and recovered 14 tons of V-2 documents by 15 May 1945, from the British Occupation Zone.

While on an official trip in March, von Braun suffered a complicated fracture of his left arm and shoulder in a car accident after his driver fell asleep at the wheel. His injuries were serious, but he insisted that his arm be set in a cast so that he could leave the hospital. Due to this neglect of the injury, he had to be hospitalized again a month later when his bones had to be rebroken and realigned.

In early April, as the Allied forces advanced deeper into Germany, Kammler ordered the engineering team, around 450 specialists, to be moved by train into the town of Oberammergau in the Bavarian Alps, where they were closely guarded by the SS with orders to execute the team if they were about to fall into enemy hands. However, von Braun managed to convince SS Major Kummer to order the dispersal of the group into nearby villages so that they would not be an easy target for U.S. bombers. On 29 April 1945, Oberammergau was captured by the Allied forces who seized the majority of the engineering team.

Nearing the end of the war, Hitler instructed SS troops to gas all technical men concerned with rocket development. Upon hearing this, von Braun commandeered a train and fled with other &quot;technical men&quot; to a location in the mountains of South Germany. After some time, von Braun and many of the others who made it to the mountains left their location to flee to advancing American lines in Austria.

Von Braun and several members of the engineering team, including Dornberger, made it to Austria. On 2 May 1945, upon finding an American private from the U.S. 44th Infantry Division, von Braun&#x27;s brother and fellow rocket engineer, Magnus, approached the soldier on a bicycle, calling out in broken English: &quot;My name is Magnus von Braun. My brother invented the V-2. We want to surrender.&quot; After the surrender, Wernher von Braun spoke to the press:

The American high command was well aware of how important their catch was: von Braun had been at the top of the &quot;Black List&quot;, the code name for the list of German scientists and engineers targeted for immediate interrogation by U.S. military experts. On 9 June 1945, two days before the originally scheduled handover of the Nordhausen and Bleicherode area in Thuringia to the Soviets, U.S. Army Major Robert B. Staver, Chief of the Jet Propulsion Section of the Research and Intelligence Branch of the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps in London, and Lieutenant Colonel R. L. Williams took von Braun and his department chiefs by Jeep from Garmisch to Munich, from where they were flown to Nordhausen. In the following days, a larger group of rocket engineers, among them Helmut Gröttrup, was evacuated from Bleicherode southwest to Witzenhausen, a small town in the American Zone.

According to Dornberger, there the Soviets tried to kidnap von Braun at night using English uniforms: Americans recognized this and did not let them in.

Von Braun was briefly detained at the &quot;Dustbin&quot; interrogation center at Kransberg Castle, where the elite of Nazi Germany&#x27;s economic, scientific, and technological sectors were debriefed by U.S. and British intelligence officials. Initially, he was recruited to the U.S. under a program called Operation Overcast, subsequently known as Operation Paperclip. There is evidence, however, that British intelligence and scientists were the first to interview him in depth, eager to gain information that they knew U.S. officials would deny them. The team included the young L.S. Snell, then the leading British rocket engineer, later chief designer of Rolls-Royce Limited and inventor of the Concorde&#x27;s engines. The specific information the British gleaned remained top secret, both from the Americans and from the other allies.

==American career==

===U.S. Army career===

On 20 June 1945, U.S. Secretary of State Edward Stettinius Jr. approved the transfer of von Braun and his specialists to the United States as one of his last acts in office. This was announced to the public on 1 October 1945.

In September 1945, von Braun and other members of the Peenemünde team signed a work contract with the United States Army Ordnance Corps. On 20 September 1945, the first seven technicians arrived in the United States at New Castle Army Air Field, just south of Wilmington, Delaware. They were then flown to Boston, Massachusetts, and taken by boat to the Army Intelligence Service post at Fort Strong in Boston Harbor. Later, with the exception of von Braun, the men were transferred to Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland to sort out the Peenemünde documents, enabling the scientists to continue their rocketry experiments.

Finally, von Braun and his remaining Peenemünde staff (see List of German rocket scientists in the United States) were transferred to their new home at Fort Bliss, a large Army installation just north of El Paso, Texas. Von Braun later wrote that he found it hard to develop a &quot;genuine emotional attachment&quot; to his new surroundings. His chief design engineer Walther Reidel became the subject of a December 1946 article, &quot;German Scientist Says American Cooking Tasteless; Dislikes Rubberized Chicken&quot;, exposing the presence of von Braun&#x27;s team in the country and drawing criticism from Albert Einstein and John Dingell. Requests to improve their living conditions such as laying linoleum over their cracked wood flooring were rejected. Von Braun was hypercritical of the slowness of the United States&#x27; development of guided missiles. His lab was never able to get sufficient funds to go on with their programs. Von Braun remarked &quot;at Peenemünde we had been coddled, here you were counting pennies&quot;. Whereas von Braun had thousands of engineers who answered to him at Peenemünde, he was now subordinate to &quot;pimply&quot; 26-year-old Jim Hamill, an Army major who possessed only an undergraduate degree in engineering. His loyal Germans still addressed him as &quot;Herr Professor&quot;, but Hamill addressed him as &quot;Wernher&quot; and never responded to von Braun&#x27;s request for more materials. Every proposal for new rocket ideas was dismissed.
While at Fort Bliss, they trained military, industrial, and university personnel in the intricacies of rockets and guided missiles. As part of the Hermes project, they helped refurbish, assemble, and launch a number of V-2s that had been shipped from Allied-occupied Germany to the White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico. They also continued to study the future potential of rockets for military and research applications. Since they were not permitted to leave Fort Bliss without military escort, von Braun and his colleagues began to refer to themselves only half-jokingly as &quot;PoPs&quot; – &quot;Prisoners of Peace&quot;.

In 1950, at the start of the Korean War, von Braun and his team were transferred to Huntsville, Alabama, his home for the next 20 years. From 1952 to 1956, von Braun led the Army&#x27;s rocket development team at Redstone Arsenal, resulting in the Redstone rocket, which was used for the first live nuclear ballistic missile tests conducted by the United States. He personally witnessed this historic launch and detonation. Work on the Redstone led to the development of the first high-precision inertial guidance system on the Redstone rocket. By 1953 von Braun&#x27;s title was, &quot;Chief, Guided Missiles Development Division, Redstone Arsenal.&quot;

As director of the Development Operations Division of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, von Braun, with his team, then developed the Jupiter-C, a modified Redstone rocket. The Jupiter-C was the basis for the Juno I rocket that successfully launched the West&#x27;s first satellite, Explorer 1, on 31 January 1958. This event signaled the birth of America&#x27;s space program.

===Popular concepts for a human presence in space===
Repeating the pattern he had established during his earlier career in Germany, von Braun – while directing military rocket development in the real world – continued to entertain his engineer-scientist&#x27;s dream of a future in which rockets would be used for space exploration. However, he was no longer at risk of being fired. As American public opinion of Germans began to recover, von Braun found himself increasingly in a position to popularize his ideas. The 14 May 1950 headline of &quot;The Huntsville Times&quot; (&quot;Dr. von Braun Says Rocket Flights Possible to Moon&quot;) might have marked the beginning of these efforts. Von Braun&#x27;s ideas rode a publicity wave that was created by science fiction movies and stories.
In 1952, von Braun first published his concept of a crewed space station in a &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; magazine series of articles titled &quot;Man Will Conquer Space Soon!&quot;. These articles were illustrated by the space artist Chesley Bonestell and were influential in spreading his ideas. Frequently, von Braun worked with fellow German-born space advocate and science writer Willy Ley to publish his concepts, which, unsurprisingly, were heavy on the engineering side and anticipated many technical aspects of space flight that later became reality.

The space station (to be constructed using rockets with recoverable and reusable ascent stages) was a toroid structure, with a diameter of ; this built on the concept of a rotating wheel-shaped station introduced in 1929 by Herman Potočnik in his book &quot;The Problem of Space Travel – The Rocket Motor&quot;. The space station spun around a central docking nave to provide artificial gravity, and was assembled in a two-hour, high-inclination Earth orbit allowing observation of essentially every point on Earth on at least a daily basis. The ultimate purpose of the space station was to provide an assembly platform for crewed lunar expeditions. More than a decade later, the movie version of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; drew heavily on the design concept in its visualization of an orbital space station.

Von Braun envisioned these expeditions as very large-scale undertakings, with a total of 50 astronauts traveling in three huge spacecraft (two for crew, one primarily for cargo), each long and in diameter and driven by a rectangular array of 30 rocket propulsion engines. Upon arrival, astronauts would establish a permanent lunar base in the Sinus Roris region by using the emptied cargo holds of their craft as shelters, and would explore their surroundings for eight weeks. This would include a expedition in pressurized rovers to the crater Harpalus and the Mare Imbrium foothills.
At this time, von Braun also worked out preliminary concepts for a human mission to Mars that used the space station as a staging point. His initial plans, published in &quot;The Mars Project&quot; (1952), had envisaged a fleet of 10 spacecraft (each with a mass of 3,720 metric tonnes), three of them uncrewed and each carrying one 200-tonne winged lander in addition to cargo, and nine crew vehicles transporting a total of 70 astronauts. The engineering and astronautical parameters of this gigantic mission were thoroughly calculated. A later project was much more modest, using only one purely orbital cargo ship and one crewed craft. In each case, the expedition used minimum-energy Hohmann transfer orbits for its trips to Mars and back to Earth.

Before technically formalizing his thoughts on human spaceflight to Mars, von Braun had written a science fiction novel on the subject, set in the year 1980. However, 18 publishers rejected the manuscript. Von Braun later published small portions of this opus in magazines, to illustrate selected aspects of his Mars project popularizations. The complete manuscript, titled &quot;Project Mars: A Technical Tale&quot;, did not appear as a printed book until December 2006.

In the hope that its involvement would bring about greater public interest in the future of the space program, von Braun also began working with Walt Disney and the Disney studios as a technical director, initially for three television films about space exploration. The initial broadcast devoted to space exploration was &quot;Man in Space&quot;, which first went on air on 9 March 1955, drawing 40 million viewers.

Later (in 1959) von Braun published a short booklet, condensed from episodes that had appeared in &quot;This Week Magazine&quot; beforedescribing his updated concept of the first crewed lunar landing. The scenario included only a single and relatively small spacecrafta winged lander with a crew of only two experienced pilots who had already circumnavigated the Moon on an earlier mission. The brute-force direct ascent flight schedule used a rocket design with five sequential stages, loosely based on the Nova designs that were under discussion at this time. After a night launch from a Pacific island, the first three stages brought the spacecraft (with the two remaining upper stages attached) to terrestrial escape velocity, with each burn creating an acceleration of 8–9 times standard gravity. The residual propellant in the third stage was used for the deceleration intended to commence only a few hundred kilometers above the landing site in a crater near the lunar north pole. The fourth stage provided acceleration to lunar escape velocity, and the fifth stage was responsible for a deceleration during return to the Earth to a residual speed that allows aerocapture of the spacecraft ending in a runway landing, much in the way of the Space Shuttle. One remarkable feature of this technical tale is that the engineer von Braun anticipated a medical phenomenon that became apparent only years later: being a veteran astronaut with no history of serious adverse reactions to weightlessness offers no protection against becoming unexpectedly and violently spacesick.

===Religious conversion===
In the first half of his life, von Braun was a nonpracticing, perfunctory Lutheran. As described by Ernst Stuhlinger and Frederick I. Ordway III: &quot;Throughout his younger years, von Braun did not show signs of religious devotion, or even an interest in things related to the church or to biblical teachings. In fact, he was known to his friends as a &#x27;merry heathen&#x27; (&quot;fröhlicher Heide&quot;).&quot; Nevertheless, in 1945 he explained his decision to surrender to the Western Allies, rather than Russians, as being influenced by a desire to share rocket technology with people whom he felt followed the Bible. In 1946, he attended church in El Paso, El Paso County, Texas, and underwent a religious conversion to Evangelical Christianity. In an unnamed religious magazine he stated:

On the motives behind this conversion, Michael J. Neufeld is of the opinion that he turned to religion &quot;to pacify his own conscience&quot;, and University of Southampton scholar Kendrick Oliver said that von Braun was presumably moved &quot;by a desire to find a new direction for his life after the moral chaos of his service for the Third Reich&quot;. Having &quot;concluded one bad bargain with the Devil, perhaps now he felt a need to have God securely at his side&quot;.

At a Gideons conference in 2004, W. Albert Wilson, a former pilot and NASA employee, stated that he had talked with von Braun about the Christian faith while von Braun was working for NASA, and believed that conversation had been instrumental in von Braun&#x27;s conversion.

Later in life, he joined an Episcopal congregation, and became increasingly religious. He publicly spoke and wrote about the complementarity of science and religion, the afterlife of the soul, and his belief in God. He stated, &quot;Through science man strives to learn more of the mysteries of creation. Through religion he seeks to know the Creator.&quot; He was interviewed by the Assemblies of God pastor C. M. Ward and stated that &quot;The farther we probe into space, the greater my faith.&quot; In addition, he met privately with evangelist Billy Graham and with the civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.

===Concepts for orbital warfare===
Von Braun developed and published his space station concept during the time of the Cold War when the U.S. government put the containment of the Soviet Union above everything else. The fact that his space station – if armed with missiles that could be easily adapted from those already available at this time – would give the United States space superiority in both orbital and orbit-to-ground warfare did not escape him. In his popular writings, von Braun elaborated on them in several of his books and articles, but he took care to qualify such military applications as &quot;particularly dreadful&quot;. This much-less-peaceful aspect of von Braun&#x27;s &quot;drive for space&quot; has been reviewed by Michael J. Neufeld from the Space History Division of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington.

===NASA career===

The U.S. Navy had been tasked with building a rocket to lift satellites into orbit, but the resulting Vanguard rocket launch system was unreliable. In 1957, with the launch of Sputnik 1, a belief grew within the United States that it lagged behind the Soviet Union in the emerging Space Race. American authorities then chose to use von Braun and his German team&#x27;s experience with missiles to create an orbital launch vehicle. Von Braun had originally proposed such an idea in 1954, but it was denied at the time.

NASA was established by law on 29 July 1958. One day later, the 50th Redstone rocket was successfully launched from Johnston Atoll in the south Pacific as part of Operation Hardtack I. Two years later, NASA opened the Marshall Space Flight Center at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, and the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) development team led by von Braun was transferred to NASA. In a face-to-face meeting with Herb York at the Pentagon, von Braun made it clear he would go to NASA only if development of the Saturn were allowed to continue. Von Braun became the center&#x27;s first director on 1 July 1960 and held the position until 27 January 1970.

Von Braun&#x27;s early years at NASA included a failed &quot;4 inch mission.&quot; On 21 November 1960 during which the first uncrewed Mercury-Redstone rocket, the rocket only rose up a mere 4 inches before settling back down onto the launch pad. The unfortunate and untimely failure of the rocket launch created a &quot;nadir of morale in Project Mercury.&quot; The launch failure was later determined to be the result of a &quot;power plug with one prong shorter than the other because a worker filed it to make it fit.&quot; Because of the difference in the length of one prong, the launch system detected the difference in the power disconnection as a &quot;cut-off signal to the engine.&quot; The safety system in fact stopped the launch.

After the success of the Mercury-Redstone 2 mission in January 1961, a mere 2 months after the failed &quot;4 inch mission,&quot; NASA morale was improved. Still, a new string of problems emerged. Von Braun insisted on one more test before the Redstone could be deemed man-rated. His overly cautious nature brought about clashes with other people involved in the program, who argued that MR-2&#x27;s technical issues were simple and had been resolved shortly after the flight. He overruled them, so a test mission involving a Redstone on a boilerplate capsule was flown successfully in March. Von Braun&#x27;s stubbornness was blamed for the inability of the U.S. to launch a crewed space mission before the Soviet Union, which ended up putting the first man in space the following month. Three weeks later on 5 May, von Braun&#x27;s team successfully launched Alan Shepard into space. He named his Mercury-Redstone 3 Freedom 7.

The Marshall Center&#x27;s first major program was the development of Saturn rockets to carry heavy payloads into and beyond Earth orbit. From this, the Apollo program for crewed Moon flights was developed. Von Braun initially pushed for a flight engineering concept that called for an Earth orbit rendezvous technique (the approach he had argued for building his space station), but in 1962, he converted to the lunar orbit rendezvous concept that was subsequently realized. During Apollo, he worked closely with former Peenemünde teammate, Kurt H. Debus, the first director of the Kennedy Space Center. His dream to help mankind set foot on the Moon became a reality on 16 July 1969, when a Marshall-developed Saturn V rocket launched the crew of Apollo 11 on its historic eight-day mission. Over the course of the program, Saturn V rockets enabled six teams of astronauts to reach the surface of the Moon.

During the late 1960s, von Braun was instrumental in the development of the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville. The desk from which he guided America&#x27;s entry into the Space Race remains on display there. He also was instrumental in the launching of the experimental Applications Technology Satellite. He traveled to India and hoped that the program would be helpful in bringing a massive educational television project to help the poorest people in that country.

During the local summer of 1966–67, von Braun participated in a field trip to Antarctica, organized for him and several other members of top NASA management. The goal of the field trip was to determine whether the experience gained by the U.S. scientific and technological community during the exploration of Antarctic wastelands would be useful for the crewed exploration of space. Von Braun was mainly interested in the management of the scientific effort on Antarctic research stations, logistics, habitation, and life support, and in using the barren Antarctic terrain like the glacial dry valleys to test the equipment that one day was used to look for signs of life on Mars and other worlds.

In an internal memo dated 16 January 1969, von Braun had confirmed to his staff that he would stay on as a center director at Huntsville to head the Apollo Applications Program. He referred to this time as a moment in his life when he felt the strong need to pray, stating &quot;I certainly prayed a lot before and during the crucial Apollo flights&quot;. A few months later, on the occasion of the first Moon landing, he publicly expressed his optimism that the Saturn V carrier system would continue to be developed, advocating human missions to Mars in the 1980s.

Nonetheless, on 1 March 1970, von Braun and his family relocated to Washington, D.C., when he was assigned the post of NASA&#x27;s Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning at NASA Headquarters. After a series of conflicts associated with the truncation of the Apollo program, and facing severe budget constraints, von Braun retired from NASA on 26 May 1972. Not only had it become evident by this time that NASA and his visions for future U.S. space flight projects were incompatible, but also it was perhaps even more frustrating for him to see popular support for a continued presence of man in space wane dramatically once the goal to reach the Moon had been accomplished.

Von Braun also developed the idea of a Space Camp that would train children in fields of science and space technologies, as well as help their mental development much the same way sports camps aim at improving physical development.
===Career after NASA===
After leaving NASA, von Braun moved to the Washington, D.C. area and became vice president for Engineering and Development at the aerospace company Fairchild Industries in Germantown, Maryland on 1 July 1972.

In 1973, during a routine physical examination, von Braun was diagnosed with kidney cancer, which could not be controlled with the medical techniques available at the time.

Von Braun helped establish and promote the National Space Institute, a precursor of the present-day National Space Society, in 1975, and became its first president and chairman. In 1976, he became a scientific consultant to Lutz Kayser, the CEO of OTRAG, and a member of the Daimler-Benz board of directors. However, his deteriorating health forced him to retire from Fairchild on 31 December 1976. When the 1975 National Medal of Science was awarded to him in early 1977, he had been hospitalized, and was unable to attend the White House ceremony.

==Engineering philosophy==
Von Braun&#x27;s insistence on more tests after Mercury-Redstone 2 flew higher than planned has been identified as contributing to the Soviet Union&#x27;s success in launching the first human in space. The successful Mercury-Redstone BD flight took the launch slot that might have put Alan Shepard into space, three weeks ahead of Yuri Gagarin. His Soviet counterpart Sergei Korolev insisted on two successful flights with dogs before risking Gagarin&#x27;s life on a crewed attempt. The second test flight took place one day after the Mercury-Redstone BD mission.

Von Braun took a conservative approach to engineering, designing with ample safety factors and redundant structure. This became a point of contention with other engineers, who struggled to keep vehicle weight down so that payload could be maximized. As noted above, his caution likely led to the U.S. losing the race to put a man into space before the Soviets. Krafft Ehricke likened von Braun&#x27;s approach to building the Brooklyn Bridge. Many at NASA headquarters jokingly referred to Marshall as the &quot;Chicago Bridge and Iron Works&quot;, but acknowledged that the designs worked. The conservative approach paid off when a fifth engine was added to the Saturn C-4, producing the Saturn V. The C-4 design had a large crossbeam that could easily absorb the thrust of an additional engine.

Von Braun did not indicate interest in politics or political philosophy during his onboarding working for the U.S. Army. He was primarily focused on his work in guided missiles for the purpose of advancing science and technology. According to FBI background checks, &quot;any political activity he may have engaged in was a means to an end to provide him with the necessary freedom to conduct his experiments.&quot; This included time spent in the Nazi party during World War 2.

During his time in NASA, he opposed racial segregation which brought him into conflict with George Wallace, who advocated racial discrimination in Alabama and wanted to continue segregation. Von Braun accused segregationist policies as obstructing the development of Alabama. His statements were considered &quot;unusual for a space scientist, particularly in the south, but well within agency and national policy.

==Personal life==
Von Braun had a charismatic personality and was known as a ladies&#x27; man. As a student in Berlin, he often was seen in the evenings in the company of two girlfriends at once. He later had a succession of affairs within the secretarial and computer pool at Peenemünde.

In January 1943, von Braun became engaged to Dorothee Brill, a physical education teacher in Berlin, and he sought permission to marry from the SS Race and Settlement Main Office. However, the engagement was broken due to his mother&#x27;s opposition. Later in 1943, he had an affair with a French woman while in Paris preparing V-2 launch sites in northeastern France. She was imprisoned for collaboration after the war and became destitute.

During his stay at Fort Bliss, von Braun proposed marriage to Maria Luise von Quistorp, his maternal first cousin, in a letter to his father. He married her in a Lutheran church in Landshut, Bavaria, on 1 March 1947, having received permission to go back to Germany and return with his bride. He was 35, and his new bride was 18. Shortly after, he converted to Evangelicalism. He returned to Manhattan on 26 March 1947, with his wife, father, and mother. On 8 December 1948, the von Brauns&#x27; first daughter together, Iris Careen, was born at Fort Bliss Army Hospital. The couple had two more children: Margrit Cécile, born in 1952, and Peter Constantine, born in 1960.

On 15 April 1955, von Braun became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

==Death==
In 1973, von Braun was diagnosed with kidney cancer during a routine medical examination. However, he continued to work unrestrained for a number of years. In 1975, President Gerald R. Ford awarded him the country&#x27;s highest science honor, the National Medal of Science in Engineering. He was too ill to attend the White House ceremony. In January 1977, then very ill, he resigned from Fairchild Industries. 

Von Braun died on 16 June 1977 of pancreatic cancer in Alexandria, Virginia, at age 65. He is buried on Valley Road at the Ivy Hill Cemetery in Alexandria. His gravestone cites Psalm 19:1: &quot;The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork&quot; (KJV).

==Recognition and critique==

* Apollo program director Sam Phillips was quoted as saying he did not think that the United States would have reached the Moon as quickly as it did without von Braun&#x27;s help. Later, after discussing it with colleagues, he amended this to say he did not believe the United States would have reached the Moon at all.
* In a TV interview on the occasion of the U.S. Moon landing in July 1969, Helmut Gröttrup, a staff member in Peenemünde and later head of the German collective in the Soviet rocketry program, set up the thesis that automatic space probes can get the same amount of scientific data with an effort of only 10 or 20 percent of the costs, and that the money should be better spent on other purposes. Von Braun justified the expenses for crewed operations with the following argument: &quot;I think somehow space flights for the first time give mankind a chance to become immortal. Once this earth will no longer be able to support life we can emigrate to other places which are better suited for our life.&quot;
* Scrutiny of von Braun&#x27;s use of forced labor at Mittelwerk intensified again in 1984 when Arthur Rudolph, one of his top affiliates from the A-4/V2 through the Apollo projects, agreed to renounce his U.S. citizenship and emigrate in exchange for not being tried for war crimes.
* A science- and engineering-oriented gymnasium in Friedberg, Bavaria was named after von Braun in 1979. In response to rising criticism, a school committee decided in 1995, after lengthy deliberations, to keep the name but &quot;to address von Braun&#x27;s ambiguity in the advanced history classes&quot;. In 2012, Nazi concentration camp survivor David Salz gave a speech in Friedberg, calling out to the public to &quot;Do everything to make this name disappear from this school!&quot;. The gymnasium was renamed &quot;Staatliches Gymnasium Friedberg&quot; in February 2014.
* An arena and entertainment complex in Huntsville, Alabama, is named the Von Braun Center in his honor. The complex opened in 1975.

Several fictional characters have been modeled on von Braun:
* &quot;Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb&quot; (1964): Dr Strangelove is usually held to be based at least partly on von Braun.
* &quot;Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny&quot; (2023): Dr. Jürgen Voller, the film&#x27;s main antagonist, is inspired partly on von Braun according to his performer Mads Mikkelsen.

In print media:
* In Warren Ellis&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Ministry of Space&quot;, von Braun is a supporting character, settling in Britain after World War II, and being essential for the realization of the British space program.
* In Jonathan Hickman&#x27;s comic book series &quot;The Manhattan Projects&quot;, von Braun is a major character.
* Satirist Mort Sahl has been credited with mocking von Braun by suggesting Braun&#x27;s book &quot;I aim at the stars&quot;, needed a subtitle: &quot;But sometimes I hit London.&quot;

In literature:
* &quot;The Good German&quot; by Joseph Kanon. Von Braun and other scientists are said to have been implicated in the use of slave labor at Peenemünde; their transfer to the U.S. forms part of the narrative.
* &quot;Space&quot; by James Michener. Von Braun and other German scientists are brought to the U.S. and form a vital part of the U.S. efforts to reach space.
* &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; by Thomas Pynchon. The novel involves British intelligence attempting to predict and avert V-2 rocket attacks. The work even includes a gyroscopic equation for the V2. The first portion of the novel, &quot;Beyond The Zero&quot;, begins with a quotation from von Braun: &quot;Nature does not know extinction; all it knows is transformation. Everything science has taught me, and continues to teach me, strengthens my belief in the continuity of our spiritual existence after death.&quot;
* &quot;V-S Day&quot; by Allen Steele is a 2014 alternate history novel in which the Space Race occurs during World War II between teams led by Robert H. Goddard and von Braun.
* &quot;&quot; by Michael Chabon (2016) includes a fictionalized description of the search for and capture of von Braun by the U.S. Army, and his role in the Nazi V-2 program and subsequently in the U.S. space program.
* &quot;V2&quot; by Robert Harris (2019) covers 5 days of von Braun&#x27;s group in Peenemünde in November 1944.

In theatre:
* &quot;Rocket City, Alabam&#x27;&quot;, a stage play by Mark Saltzman, weaves von Braun&#x27;s real life with a fictional plot in which a young Jewish woman in Huntsville, Alabama becomes aware of his Nazi past and tries to inspire awareness and outrage. Von Braun is a character in the play.

In music:
* &quot;Infinite Journey&quot; (1962), Johann Sebastian Bach and Apollo program rocket sounds album by various artists including Henry Mazer, which features von Braun as a narrator.
* &quot;Wernher von Braun&quot; (1965): A song written and performed by Tom Lehrer for an episode of NBC&#x27;s American version of the BBC TV show &quot;That Was The Week That Was&quot;; the song was later included in Lehrer&#x27;s albums &quot;That Was The Year That Was&quot; and &quot;The Remains of Tom Lehrer&quot;. It was a satire on what Lehrer saw as von Braun&#x27;s cavalier attitude toward the consequences of his work in Nazi Germany. For example, one line in the song states: &quot;A man whose allegiance/ Is ruled by expedience/ Call him a Nazi, he won&#x27;t even frown/ &#x27;Nazi, Schmazi!&#x27; says Wernher von Braun.&quot; There was a widespread rumour that von Braun had sued Lehrer for the song, but this is untrue.
* &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot; (1991): A rock opera by Grant Hart&#x27;s post-Hüsker Dü alternative rock group Nova Mob, in which von Braun features as a character. The album includes a song called &quot;Wernher von Braun&quot;.

<text>Wrecking is the practice of taking valuables from a shipwreck which has foundered or run aground close to shore. Often an unregulated activity of opportunity in coastal communities, wrecking has been subjected to increasing regulation and evolved into what is now known as marine salvage.

Wrecking is no longer economically significant. However, as recently as the 19th century in some parts of the world, it was the mainstay of otherwise economically marginal coastal communities.

A traditional legendary trope is that of wreckers deliberately decoying ships on to coasts using tricks, especially false lights, so that they run ashore for easy plundering. While this has been depicted in many stories and legends, there is no clear evidence that this has ever happened.

==Luring ships to wreck with false lights==

There are legends that some ships were deliberately lured into danger by a display of false lights. John Viele, retired U.S. Navy officer and author of a history of wrecking in the Florida Keys, states that such tricks simply would not work. He points out that mariners interpret a light as indicating land, and so avoid them if they cannot identify them. Moreover, oil lanterns cannot be seen very far over water at night, unless they are large, fitted with mirrors or lenses, and mounted at a great height (i.e., in a lighthouse). In hundreds of admiralty court cases heard in Key West, Florida, no captain of a wrecked ship ever charged that he had been led astray by a false light.

A Bahamian wrecker, when asked if he and his crewmates made beacons on shore or showed their lights to warn ships away from the land at night, is reported to have said, &quot;No, no [laughing]; we always put them out for a better chance by night&quot;.

Legend maintains that the town of Nags Head, North Carolina takes its name from wreckers or &quot;bankers&quot; deploying false lights. The toponymic legend states that in the 18th century, wreckers would hang lanterns from the necks of mules (colloquially called &quot;nags&quot; at the time) and walk the animals very slowly up and down the beach. The alleged intent was to fool mariners into believing that the slow-moving lights were ships drifting at rest or at anchor, prompting the ships to change course and subsequently run aground.

In 1860, a writer for &quot;Harper’s New Monthly Magazine&quot; corroborated the story of the &quot;bankers&quot; who gave Nags Head its name.

==Wrecking in the Americas==

===Spanish America===
As soon as the Spanish began sending home the treasures they found in the New World, some of the treasure was lost in shipwrecks. By the 1540s Indians along the coast of Florida, where many of the Spanish treasure ships wrecked, were diving on the wrecks and recovering significant amounts of gold and silver. By that time the Spanish had been using first Indians (the Lucayans from the Bahamas were particularly prized for the task) and then Africans to dive for pearls around the islands near present-day Venezuela. The Spanish began using these divers to recover treasure from shipwrecks. The Spanish kept salvage ships with crews of African divers on-call in major ports around the Caribbean, ready to sail as soon as word of a wreck was received. In the course of the 16th through the 18th centuries the Spanish recovered more than 100,000,000 pesos worth of treasure by such means. Spanish salvage efforts had varying success. Although the Spanish carried out salvage operations on the wrecks of the 1715 Treasure Fleet for four years, they recovered less than half of the treasure recorded as sent on the fleet. On the other hand, the Spanish recovered more treasure from the 1733 treasure fleet than had been officially registered on it.

===Bermuda and Jamaica===
In the 16th and 17th centuries, Spanish ships returning to Spain from the Caribbean rode the Gulf Stream to Cape Canaveral and then aimed for Bermuda. Raising Bermuda was essential to Spanish ships for verifying their position before setting course for the Azores. As a result, some Spanish ships wrecked on Bermuda. After the English settled on Bermuda in the early 17th century, they quickly took up &quot;wracking&quot; on Bermuda, and then extended their search for wrecks to all of the Caribbean. Later in the 17th century the center for English &quot;wracking&quot; in the Caribbean shifted to Port Royal in Jamaica. William Phips went there to recruit the divers he used to salvage treasure from a Spanish wreck on the north shore of Hispaniola, where he recovered the largest amount of treasure from a single wreck before the 20th century.
===The Bahamas===
Wrecking (or &quot;wracking&quot;) was an important activity in the Bahamas from its first settlement in 1648. A company of religious dissidents from Bermuda, the Eleutheran Adventurers, established a colony on Eleutheria. Their governing document, the &quot;Articles and Orders&quot;, included regulations of wrecking, providing that any salvaged ordnance would be held in common for the defense of the colony, and all other salvaged goods would be delivered to designated agents, &quot;made fit for sale&quot; and then sold, with one-third of the proceeds going to the wreckers.

While the Eleutheran Adventurers were primarily farmers, seamen from Bermuda began settling on New Providence in the 1660s, attracted by ambergris, wrecks and salt. There were vessels dedicated to wrecking from this time, but wrecking was a secondary occupation for most men. These seamen, who called themselves &quot;wrackers&quot; or &quot;wreckers&quot;, pursued wrecking aggressively, regarding all salvage as their property. They were rumored to have killed people who had inconveniently survived a shipwreck. They drove Spanish salvors away from Spanish wrecks, and even took goods that the Spanish had already salvaged. Spain regarded the Bahamian wreckers as pirates, and retaliated by attacking the wreckers&#x27; ships, kidnapping farmers from New Providence, and burning the capital, Charles Town.

The Bahamian government eventually exerted control over the wreckers. The wreckers were required to carry salvaged goods to Nassau, where they were auctioned. However, goods useful on a ship or in a wrecker&#x27;s home were often diverted with a blind eye turned by government officials. Increased shipping after the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 led to more wrecks. Vessels specifically designed for wrecking were built in the Bahamas. A U.S law of 1825 required that all goods salvaged from wrecks in U.S. waters be taken to an American port of entry (which, for the Bahamians, meant Key West, Florida). Many Bahamian wreckers eventually moved to Key West and became U.S. citizens.

Wrecking was a mainstay of the Bahamian economy through most of the 19th century. In 1856, there were 302 ships and 2,679 men (out of a total population of 27,000) licensed as wreckers in the Bahamas. In that year salvaged wreck cargo brought to Nassau was valued at £96,304, more than half of all imports to the Bahamas. More than two-thirds of exports from the Bahamas were salvaged goods. The government normally took 15% customs duty on salvaged goods. If the salvaged cargo was not claimed, the Vice Admiralty Court took 30%, and the Governor took another 10%. Shore workers (warehouse workers, agents and laborers) usually received around 14% of the value. The wreckers themselves usually received 40% to 60% of the value of the salvaged goods. Even so, the average annual income of an ordinary seaman on a wrecker was about £20.

The American Civil War sharply cut the volume of shipping around the Bahamas, and the wreckers suffered with far fewer wrecks to salvage. The end of the Civil War brought back increased shipping and wrecks. In 1865, the last year of the Civil War, £28,000 worth of salvaged goods were taken to Nassau. In 1866, that rose to £108,000, and peaked at £154,000 in 1870. Wrecking then entered a decline, and was nearly gone by the end of the 19th century. More lighthouses (eventually numbering 37 in the Bahamas), better charts, more ships powered by steam, better qualified ship&#x27;s officers, and more seaworthy ships all contributed to fewer wrecks.

===The Florida Keys===
For several centuries, wrecking was an important economic activity in the Florida Keys. During the 19th century, wrecking in the Keys became a highly organized and regulated industry, with dozens of vessels and hundreds of men active in the trade at any given time. The Florida Keys form a long arc of islands extending from the southern end of the east coast of Florida to the Dry Tortugas. A line of shallow coral reefs, the Florida Reef, runs parallel to the Keys from east of Cape Florida to southwest of Key West, with dangerous shoals stretching west from Key West to the Dry Tortugas. This chain of reefs and shoals is approximately long, separated from the Keys by the narrow and relatively shallow Hawk Channel. The Gulf Stream passes close to the Florida Reef through the Straits of Florida, which is the major route for shipping between the eastern coast of the United States and ports in the Gulf of Mexico and the western Caribbean Sea. The combination of heavy shipping and a powerful current flowing close to dangerous reefs made the Florida Keys the site of a great many wrecks, especially during the 19th century. Ships were wrecking on the Florida Reef at the rate of almost once a week in the middle of the 19th century (the collector of customs in Key West reported a rate of 48 wrecks a year in 1848). For a period of almost 100 years, wrecking captains and wrecking vessels in the Keys had to hold a license issued by the Federal court. In 1858, there were 47 boats and ships licensed as wreckers.

====Early history====
Ships began wrecking along the Florida Reef almost as soon as Europeans reached the New World. From early in the 16th century, Spanish ships returning from the New World to Spain sailed from Havana to catch the Gulf Stream, which meant they passed close to the Florida Reef, with some wrecking. The first wreckers in the Keys were Indians; when Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda&#x27;s ship was wrecked in 1549, he was taken prisoner by Indians who were experienced in plundering wrecked ships. In 1622, six ships of the Spanish treasure fleet wrecked during a hurricane in the lower Keys. Spanish operations to recover the gold and silver from the lost ships continued intermittently for 21 years, but the Spanish lost track of the &quot;Nuestra Señora de Atocha&quot;, which was finally found and excavated in the 20th century. In 1733, 19 ships of the Spanish treasure fleet wrecked during a hurricane in the middle and upper keys, and salvage operations lasted four years. The Spanish used dragged chains, grapnels, free divers and even an early diving bell to find and recover goods from the wrecked ships.

Starting in the 18th century, ships from The Bahamas began frequenting the Florida Keys. The Bahamians were opportunists, fishing, turtling, logging tropical hardwoods on the Keys, and salvaging wrecks as the opportunity arose. When the Spanish were salvaging the wrecks of the 1733 treasure fleet, the Spanish commander of the operation expressed concern that the Bahamians would try to salvage some of the treasure on their own. By 1775, George Gauld, who produced a chart of the Keys that was still being used 75 years later, advised mariners to stay with their ships if they wrecked, so that the Bahamian wreckers could assist them. Although the Keys were at various times part of Spanish Florida, the British colony of East Florida and the U.S. Florida Territory, the Bahamians took goods salvaged from ships wrecked in the Keys to Nassau for adjudication, rather than to the Florida port of entry, St. Augustine. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812 in 1815, increased shipping through the Straits of Florida resulted in an increase in wrecks on the Keys, and the Crown&#x27;s share from the auction of salvaged goods became the major support of the economy of Nassau.

====Under United States jurisdiction====
After 1815, fishing boats from New England began visiting the Florida Keys in the winter to fish for the Havana market. These fishermen engaged in wrecking when the opportunity arose. With the acquisition of Florida by the United States in 1821 and the settlement of Key West in 1822, the New England fishermen-wreckers began moving their homes to Key West. Conflicts quickly developed with the Bahamian wreckers. U.S. Navy ships stopped and boarded Bahamian wreckers to check papers, and arrested two Bahamian captains on suspicion of smuggling slaves. American wreckers became increasingly hostile to Bahamian wreckers, and in 1825 the U.S. Congress passed a law requiring all goods salvaged in U.S. waters to be taken to an American port of entry. This measure created a great inconvenience for the Bahamian wreckers, as they had to take salvaged goods and ships to Key West before they could return home to the Bahamas. Some of them soon moved to Key West and acquired U.S. citizenship.

Key West had become a port of entry in 1822. In the same year, the U.S. Navy chose Key West as its base for suppressing piracy in the West Indies. The city quickly developed into Florida&#x27;s most important port. By the 1830s, Key West accounted for 60% to 90% of imports and exports for the Territory. Most of this traffic was due to the activities of the wreckers. Warehouses for storing salvaged goods, shipyards for repairing damaged ships that had been removed from the reefs and for building vessels to be used in wrecking, and ship chandlers for refitting ships all contributed to the city&#x27;s prosperity.

In the 1820s and 1830s, Indian Key functioned as a secondary center for the wrecking industry in the Keys. Closer to most of the reefs off the keys than Key West, Indian Key enjoyed a brief prosperity before being destroyed in a raid by Seminoles in 1840.

====Wrecking operations====
Wrecking in the Florida Keys was conducted from sailing vessels. Numerous vessels would patrol along the Florida Reef looking for wrecks. The wreckers would normally anchor at night in protected anchorages along the Keys, and then sail out in the morning to see if any ships had wrecked during the night. As a result, a ship that ran on the reef during the night might attract a dozen wreckers by the afternoon of the next day. The first wrecking captain to reach a stranded ship became the wreck master, determining how many wreckers he needed to help salvage the ship, and directing the operation. Wreckers had an obligation to save passengers and crew of the wrecked ship (for which they received no compensation), and to salvage as much of the cargo as possible, and the ship, as well. If the judge in Federal court decided that a wrecking crew had not done everything possible to salvage cargo and ship, he would reduce the award.

The salvaged cargo and the ship, if it could be saved, were taken to Key West where they were appraised or auctioned. The wrecking vessels and crews that participated in the operations would then be awarded a share of the salvage value. Half of the salvage award went to the owners of the wrecking vessels, divided among the boats on a tonnage basis. The other half went to the wrecker crews, proportional to the number of crewmen on each vessel. Ordinary crewmen received one share, &quot;boys&quot; a half-share, cooks, one-and-a-quarter shares, and captains one to three shares, depending on the size of the vessel. Divers, who dived into the flooded holds of ships to retrieve cargo, received extra shares. By the time a salvage award was divided this way, individual shares were often quite small. Contemporary observers estimated that wrecking crews on average made no more than an ordinary seaman.

In the first few years after Florida was acquired by the United States, salvage awards were determined either by prior agreement between the wreck master and the captain of the wrecked ship, or by arbitration. As the persons available to serve as arbitrators usually had ties to the wrecking industry, if not a direct business relationship with the wreck master and/or the owners of the wrecking vessels, the process was often abused, with awards as high as 90% of the salvaged value. In 1829, a United States District Court was established in Key West with admiralty jurisdiction, after which most salvage cases were decided in court. Court awards for a wrecking operation averaged about 25% of the salvage value. Private agreements and arbitration remained an option, however, particularly when the judge was not available. A visitor to Key West in the 1880s reported that the United States District Court was in session almost every week, and had heard more than 700 Admiralty law cases during the preceding year.

Wreckers were required by the Federal law to carry equipment that might be needed to save cargo and ships. Such equipment included heavy anchors for kedging (hauling) ships off reefs, heavy hawsers and chain, fenders and blocks and tackle. Wreckers also had to be prepared to make emergency repairs to ships to refloat them or keep them afloat while they were sailed or towed back to Key West. By the middle of the 19th century, windmill-powered pumps, and later a steam-powered pump, were kept in Key West. If the wreckers were not able to pump out a ship fast enough to float it using the ship&#x27;s own pumps, they could rent one of the large pumps from Key West. As the wrecking vessels could not always directly approach wrecked ships, they had to carry sturdy boats.

Cargoes saved by wreckers varied tremendously. Cotton was perhaps the most valuable bulk cargo. A bale of cotton might be worth US$50 or $60 in Charleston, South Carolina, but a bale pulled from a flooded hold would be saturated with water, and weigh as much as half a ton. Unusual cargoes salvaged by wreckers included the fossilized &quot;Hydrarchos&quot; skeleton collected in Alabama by Albert Koch, and a locomotive. In 1827, &quot;Guerrero&quot;, a Spanish slave-runner carrying 500 African captives, and the Royal Navy warship HMS &quot;Nimble&quot; ran onto the Florida Reef during a running gun battle. Wreckers went to the aid of both ships. After most of the Africans and the Spanish crewmen had been transferred to wrecker vessels, the Spanish crewmen commandeered two of the ships and sailed to Cuba with most of the Africans. The remaining 120 Africans were taken to Key West, and then to St. Augustine. After Congress passed a special law the next year, 96 surviving Africans were sent to Liberia.

====Decline====
In an effort to reduce the number of wrecks along the Florida Reef, the United States government funded the construction of lighthouses. Lighthouses were built in the 1820s at Cape Florida, Key West (both on the island itself and on nearby Sand Key), and on Garden Key in the Dry Tortugas. A lightship was stationed at Carysfort Reef. Mariners complained that the lights were not visible enough. There were also long interruptions. The Cape Florida lighthouse was burned by Seminoles in 1836 and remained dark for ten years. It was also dark while the tower was made higher in 1855. It was put out of commission again in 1860 by Confederate sympathizers and remained dark until the end of the American Civil War in 1865. The Key West and Sand Key lighthouses were destroyed by a hurricane in 1846. A lightship was placed at Sand Key until the lighthouses could be rebuilt. Beginning in 1852 lighthouses were built directly on the Florida Reef, but it was 1880 before mariners could rely on having a lighthouse in sight at all times while sailing along the Florida Reef.

The wreckers were unhappy about the lights, expecting them to reduce the number of wrecks and their livelihood. Initially, however, the lights did not greatly reduce the number of wrecks. Some ships wrecked when their captains became confused about which lights they were seeing, mistaking lights on the Florida Reef for lights on the Bahama Banks. Some wrecks may have been deliberate, as well. On a few occasions wreckers trying to refloat flooded ships discovered that holes had been bored through the hull below the water line. The captain of a ship that had wrecked stated that the wreck was not to be greatly regretted, as there were too many ships in the freight business. Judge Marvin of the Federal court in Key West told a navy officer in 1860 there was &quot;a great deal of wrecking by design.&quot;

Shipping through the Straits of Florida, and therefore the number of wrecks on the Florida Reef, declined sharply during the Civil War. Following the Civil War, the number of wrecks did not increase as fast as the ship traffic through the Straits. More lighthouses were in place, better charts were available, and more ships were powered by steam and thus less vulnerable to being pushed onto reefs by unfavorable winds. Steam-powered vessels began to enter the wrecking trade. Eventually ocean-going tugboats took over what became known as marine salvage operations. By the end of the 19th century, wrecks were infrequent. The last major wrecking operation was in 1905, when 77 small vessels and 500 men salvaged cargo from the steamer &quot;Alicia&quot;. Salvage work was abandoned when divers refused to continue, as contaminated water in the hold was causing them to become blind for 24 hours after a dive. The salvage award was US$17,690. The last local wrecker was bought out by a New York company in 1920. The Federal court closed the book of wrecking licenses the next year.

===British North America and Canada===
Residents of the isolated communities along the outer banks of North Carolina and the Islands of Hatteras, Ocracoke, and Portsmouth and in Newfoundland and the islands and coastline of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and engaged in wrecking for many years. In Nova Scotia, Seal Island and especially Sable Island were known for wrecking. Reports of violent wreckers on Sable helped spur efforts by the colony of Nova Scotia to establish a rescue station in Sable Island in 1801.

== Wrecking in Europe ==

=== Britain ===

Wrecks were frequent in Devon and Cornwall where the rocky coastline, and strong prevailing onshore winds helped wreck many merchant ships and warships.

In 1735 a law was passed to make it an offence to make false lights, but no one was prosecuted as a result. In 1769 William Pearse was hanged at Launceston in Cornwall for stealing from a wreck. It was not until after a case in the Court of Appeal in 1870 that rewards were made for rescuing people.

Wrecking was a major industry in the 19th century, and as far back as the 16th century, especially of ships returning from the New World using the Gulf Stream, which passes by the south west of England. This would help to speed these ships on their way to France and Spain and put them out of position. Wreckers would attempt to frighten off the curious, suspicious or unwanted visitors, by spreading wild rumours concerning supernatural activity, ghosts and cannibals (as told about in Clovelly) near their wrecking sites.

Wrecking was a major activity of the inhabitants of Stroma Island in the Pentland Firth off the north of Scotland. It was also well known on the Goodwin Sands off the south east of England where over 2000 wrecks have occurred. The boatmen of Deal, who took supplies to ships at anchor off the coast, would plunder any wrecked vessel. Another area where wrecking was prevalent was the Wirral Peninsula, near Liverpool, where wrecking continued to be reported into the early twentieth century.

A 2005 BBC documentary, &quot;Coast&quot;, successfully replicated the conditions of false light wrecking in an experiment which suggested that a single-candle lantern onshore would be insufficient to lure a boat into dangerous water on a dark night. The boat crew did not see the light until they got within 150m of it.

In 2007 the container ship MSC &quot;Napoli&quot; went aground off Branscombe beach in Devon. Some of its cargo was washed ashore and many wreckers plundered the cargo in spite of attempts to prevent this. People came long distances to retrieve such things as BMW motorcycles. Goods from wrecks are supposed by law to be reported to the &quot;Receiver of Wreck&quot; and finders will then be given a reward.

=== Denmark ===
Wrecking has been practised a long way back in Denmark. The long shorelines, the heavy international marine traffic in combination with some difficult and often harsh waters, has produced many wrecks here. It was only recently, that the light signalling was fully developed and deep sea-bed canals were dug in the often very shallow waters here, making seafaring relatively safe. Skagen&#x27;s Vippefyr was constructed in 1627, along with several other rudimentary lighting signals in the following years, after complaints. Sea floor canals came centuries later. It was and still is common practice to hire skilled Danish pilots to help navigate in and out of the Baltic Sea.

So-called wreck masters used to be employed in the Danish coastal communities, in order to oversee, report on and collect valuables from new wrecks. A former wreck masters home can be experienced at the Wreck Master&#x27;s Farm near Rubjerg Knude on the North Atlantic coast for example. The last wreck master here left in 1992. A few wreck masters are still appointed in Denmark, but nowadays the job also includes observations and reporting on oil spills, pollutions, vandalism, etc., and they work in close cooperation with the police.

==Fictional accounts==
Wreckers have been featured in a number of works of fiction, including a references in &quot;The Shipping News&quot; by E. Annie Proulx, &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot; by Daphne du Maurier, &quot;Shipwrecks&quot; by Akira Yoshimura, the film &quot;The Light at the Edge of the World&quot; based on the novel &quot;Le Phare du bout du monde&quot; by Jules Verne, and also in the opening chapter of Verne&#x27;s &quot;The Archipelago on Fire&quot;.

The plot of Compton Mackenzie&#x27;s novel &quot;Whisky Galore&quot; revolves around the inhabitants of a small Scottish island recovering as-yet-untaxed whisky from a shipwreck and their subsequent efforts at evading government officials.

Dame Ethel Smyth&#x27;s opera, &quot;The Wreckers&quot;, is set in Cornwall—the plot revolves around deliberate wrecking.

In 1942, the Technicolor Movie &quot;Reap The Wild Wind &quot; by Cecil B. DeMille depicted life in the wrecking business in the Nineteenth Century around Key West, Florida. It garnered an Academy Award for underwater Special Effects.

In 1962, the &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot; TV series aired a two-episode live action adventure film entitled &quot;The Mooncussers&quot; about the investigation and exposure of a gang of wreckers.

Enid Blyton, specifically in the &quot;Famous Five&quot; books, writes often about the treasures of the wreckers.

&quot;The Wreckers&quot;, by Iain Lawrence, is a book for younger readers about &quot;The Isle of Skye&quot; (a London vessel) being shipwrecked along the shores of Pendennis, Cornwall.

<text>The Wanderer is a science fiction novel by American writer Fritz Leiber, published as a paperback original by Ballantine Books in 1964. It won the 1965 Hugo Award for Best Novel.

Following its initial paperback edition, &quot;The Wanderer&quot; was reissued in hardcover by Walker &amp; Co. in 1969, by Gregg Press in 1980, and by the Easton Press in 1991, as well as a Science Fiction Book Club edition in 1987. It was released in hardcover in the UK by Dennis Dobson in 1967, with a paperback edition following from Penguin Books in 1969. Translations have appeared in Dutch, French, German, Hungarian and Italian.

&quot;The Wanderer&quot; was the first novel to win the Hugo Award without previously being published in hardcover or appearing in some form in a genre magazine.

The novel deals with a wandering planet that enters the Solar System. Its narrative follows multiple disconnected groups of characters to portray the widespread impact of the Wanderer on the entire population of the Earth (and above it) as well as the varied reactions of different groups as they struggle to cope and survive.

==Plot==
The novel is set in a future, a few years after its 1964 publication date. The Space Race is still on-going. Both the USA and the USSR have lunar bases, but the Soviets have retained their early lead by sending an expedition to Mars. The Vietnam War continues, but seems not to be a big issue for US citizens. Also an underground anti-Communist army now operates within North Vietnam. Some independent outsiders bring supplies by sea to both sides. Technology is much the same, apart from better spaceflight.

From the point of view of most of the population of the Earth, a new planet appears out of nowhere close to the Moon towards the end of a total lunar eclipse. It is attended by a twinkling of stars, which some astronomers explain as the planet emerging out of hyperspace. This is later confirmed by a man captured by a feline humanoid, and she also explains that the moon was destroyed to fuel the wandering planet.

The planet&#x27;s appearance is startling - several massive patterns of purple and gold, and initially resembling the Tao symbol of human culture.

Within a few days the planet – soon referred to by everyone simply &quot;The Wanderer&quot;– consumes the Moon. Its gravity causes mass death and destruction as it raises huge ocean waves and causes earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Flying saucers appear, apparently trying to mitigate some of the disastrous effects. Then, after a spectacular battle in space between the new planet and yet another which had appeared just as suddenly, the skies are empty again. Earth is left without its Moon.

The novel follows the lives of disparate people around the globe. There is a man attempting a solo crossing of the Atlantic Ocean, a smuggler operating off the coast of Vietnam, two friends in England, a trio of drug addicts in New York City, and the military controllers of the USA Moon mission, deep in a bunker somewhere near Washington, D.C.

The main protagonists are three longtime friends. Paul Hagbolt is escorting Margo Gelhorn (and her cat, Miaow) to observe the lunar eclipse at an observatory in California. Their friend, and Margo&#x27;s fiance, is Don Merriam, one of the American astronauts at the Moon base. Following on a whim a sign advertising a &quot;flying saucer symposium&quot;, Paul and Margo fall in with a group of intellectuals, dreamers, charlatans and misfits. At that point events overtake them. The new planet appears and triggers an earthquake that buries their cars in a landslide. They must avoid tsunamis, more earthquakes, roving mobs and flying saucers to survive. On the Moon Don Merriam is the only astronaut to escape the destruction of the American moonbase. He tries to take off in one of the base&#x27;s spaceships, only to fall through the Moon itself as it splits asunder under the influence of the new planet. His ship is eventually captured by its crew.

Events take a bizarre turn when the group of saucer enthusiasts is faced with a tsunami. A flying saucer appears, and a cat-like being uses some kind of gun to repel the waves. Then the being uses the same device to pull Paul, who is holding Miaow, into the saucer. At the same time the gun falls into the hands of the people on the ground.

In the saucer Paul meets a being calling itself Tigerishka. A large, female telepathic feline creature, she initially mistakes Miaow as the intelligent being whose thoughts she can hear, and Paul as a &quot;monkey&quot;. Realizing her mistake, she regards Paul with contempt. Monkey-beings are not well regarded by her people. However she slowly warms to him, and explains why her planet had consumed the Moon.

Like many of the human characters, her people are intellectuals, dreamers, charlatans and misfits. They belong to a culture that spans the Universe, has achieved immortality, and can construct planets and traverse hyperspace. They can even create bodies for themselves that reflect the origins of their races, such as Tigerishka&#x27;s cat-form. They are, however, fleeing their culture&#x27;s police. The standard culture rejects nonconformists, and devotes itself to ensuring that intelligent life survives to the end of time, whereas Tigerishka&#x27;s cohort wants to explore hyperspace and tinker with space, time and the Mind. Their flight has brought them to Earth orbit to refuel as huge amounts of matter must be converted to energy to power their hyperspace drive and their weapons: the Wanderer is running on empty.

As alien as Tigerishka is, Paul becomes besotted with her. Tigerishka eventually yields to his advances. At the same time, Don Merriam has been rescued with his ship by the Wanderer&#x27;s other spaceships. He is reunited with Paul aboard Tigerishka&#x27;s ship. Now they must testify in the Wanderer&#x27;s trial, for the police have arrived. A second planet, &quot;The Stranger&quot;, colored a dull gray where the Wanderer is bright purple and yellow, appears and threatens battle. Don and Paul give their testimony as to the good treatment they have seen, along with thousands of other humans appearing by some kind of holographic projection. However the trial goes badly. Paul and Don are evacuated in Don&#x27;s ship, placed into position close to Earth by Tigerishka. Tigerishka takes Miaow with her back to her planet. Then the final battle takes place, and both planets disappear. In the final scene, Margo and her companions walk to Vandenberg Spaceport as Don&#x27;s ship comes in to land.

==Characters==

===The three friends===
Margo Gelhorn, Paul Hagbolt and Donald Merriam have been friends since High School. Don became an astronaut, and Paul followed him into NASA by using his journalism qualifications to become a publicist for the agency. Margo eventually bestowed her affections on Don and became his fiancee. This left Paul with unrequited feelings for her, although Margo tells Paul that his feelings for Don are &quot;more than brotherly&quot;. The three form an odd triangle. Margo herself is manipulative and exploits both Paul and Don to serve her ends. Don is a loner at heart, however. The triangle is set to fly apart. Their collision with the Saucer Symposium provides the trigger.

===The Saucer Symposium===
When Paul and Margo encounter the Saucer Symposium on the beach near Vandenberg, they give the participants nicknames.
* &quot;Doc&quot; (Rudolf Brecht) is a relentless debunker of UFO myths and a top-notch piano salesman. He is one of the symposium organizers and chairmen.
* &quot;Turban&quot; (Rama Joan) is a mystic who wears a turban and a man&#x27;s tuxedo. She was once the wife of a New York stockbroker but abandoned the comfortable lifestyle to lecture on mysticism and participate in events like the Symposium as a search for enlightenment.
* &quot;Beardy&quot; (Prof. Ross Hunter) is a sociologist from Oregon State University. He originally began studying UFO groups but became interested in the subject itself. During the adventures caused by the appearance of the Wanderer, he gets close to Margo and eventually seduces her, in the process exposing and neutralizing her manipulative instincts.
* &quot;The Little Man&quot; (Clarence Dowd) is a meticulous documenter of UFO events. He draws the Wanderer as it shows its different faces to Earth. These drawings appear in the book.
* &quot;The Ramrod&quot; (Charlie Furby) is a tough-looking man who is really a fantasist. He insists that he has been transported to planets such as Ispan, whose location only he knows, but later admits he did this entirely in his fantasies. He is accompanied by two women who may both be his wives, part of a polygamous sect.

===New Yorkers===
* Sally Harris and Jake Lesher are looking for a good time and thinking about writing a play. They start with an amorous encounter on a Coney Island roller coaster, achieving orgasm the instant the Wanderer appears. They wander through the crowds in Times Square, then take refuge in a penthouse apartment as the flood begins. They barely survive as the tsunami caused by Wanderer and the Stranger almost reaches roof.
* Arab Jones, Pepe Martinez and High Bundy are stoners. High on marijuana, they chase the sight of the Wanderer through the streets of New York, making up crazy stories about it. They are eventually drowned by in-rushing flood in a subway station.

===Floridians===
* Barbara Katz is another adventurous young woman with an agenda. She catches an old millionaire, Knolls K. Kettering III, spying on her with his telescope while she sunbathes. Deciding to become his &quot;friend&quot; she dons a black &quot;playsuit&quot; and sneaks into his yard during the eclipse, finding him observing the event with the same telescope. With &quot;KKK&quot; and his black servants, she tries to escape the flood tides by driving to high ground in the limousine. Dodging racist policemen and a delegation of Ku Klux Klan vigilantes they ride out one flood by climbing trees, then find a washed-up yacht in which they survive the subsequent catastrophes.

===An undisclosed location===
* General &quot;Spike&quot; Stevens and Colonel Mabel Wallingford are two members of Mission Control team for the Moonbase, stationed deep underground somewhere near Washington D.C. At first they think the events are a &quot;problem&quot;, a simulation created by their superiors to test their readiness. Not long after they realize that the events on their screens are real, the facility floods with water. Stevens and Wallingford are left trapped together. Fully aware they are about to die, they find their final release in each other, despite having hated each other from the moment they met.

===In Great Britain===
* Dai Davies and Richard Hillary enjoy a drink together in the English county of Somerset and then go their separate ways. Hillary returns to the Home Counties of England but is caught in the exodus from the lowlands as tides flood the Thames basin. He survives by reaching high ground in the Malvern Hills. Davies, a romantic poet, composes odes to the new planet and then attempts to walk to Wales across the apparently dry estuary of the river Severn. He is finally engulfed in a huge version of the Severn bore and drowns.

===At sea===
*Wolf Loner is attempting a solo crossing of the Atlantic. Because of bad weather, and the loss of radio communication, he has no idea that anything is happening in the sky. His first inkling that anything strange has happened is when his boat bumps up against the bell tower of Old North Church in Boston.
* Bagong Bung is a smuggler supplying both sides in a guerrilla war, operating off the coast of Vietnam. The suddenly large tides uncover a wreck on the sea floor, which he loots for treasure.
* Off the coast of South America, the atomic powered cruise liner &quot;Prince Charles&quot; is hijacked by revolutionaries. Flood tides carry it deep into the Amazon basin where it eventually comes to rest on land, like Noah&#x27;s Ark, with hundreds of passengers.

==Reception==
P. Schuyler Miller described the book as a &quot;thoroughly uncharacteristic&quot; Leiber novel, saying that &quot;the feel of what is happening . . . counts for more than the plot&quot; and predicting that &quot;The Wanderer&quot; &quot;would eventually be awarded &#x27;classic&#x27; status&quot;. Avram Davidson compared the novel unfavorably to Leiber&#x27;s &quot;Conjure Wife&quot;, saying &quot;The canvas is wide, the characters many, the charge scatters like buckshot, if you can imagine a buckshot cannon&quot;.

James Nicoll has described the novel as &quot;terrible&quot;, saying that although its premise — &quot;hollow planets filled with catgirls who want to steal the moon&quot; — may be &quot;amazing or at least intriguing&quot;, the novel itself &quot;falls well short of its potential&quot;; he attributes its Hugo win to a weak slate of nominees, and to Leiber&#x27;s &quot;blatant and unabashed sucking up to SF fandom&quot;.

==Availability==
&quot;The Wanderer&quot; is available in paperback under (Gollancz, 2000) as part of the SF Masterworks series.

<doc id="33800" wikidata="Q27496" url="?curid=33800" title="Western Europe">
<text>Western Europe is the western region of Europe. The region&#x27;s extent varies depending on context.
The concept of &quot;the West&quot; appeared in Europe in juxtaposition to &quot;the East&quot; and originally applied to the Western half of the ancient Mediterranean world, the Latin West of the Roman Empire, and &quot;Western Christendom&quot;. Beginning with the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery, roughly from the 15th century, the concept of &quot;Europe&quot; as &quot;the West&quot; slowly became distinguished from and eventually replaced the dominant use of &quot;Christendom&quot; as the preferred endonym within the area. By the Age of Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution, the concepts of &quot;Eastern Europe&quot; and &quot;Western Europe&quot; were more regularly used. The distinctiveness of Western Europe became most apparent during the Cold War, when Europe was divided for 40 years by the Iron Curtain into the Western Bloc and Eastern Bloc, each characterised by distinct political and economical systems.

==Historical divisions==
===Classical antiquity and medieval origins===
Prior to the Roman conquest, a large part of Western Europe had adopted the newly developed La Tène culture. As the Roman domain expanded, a cultural and linguistic division appeared between the mainly Greek-speaking eastern provinces, which had formed the highly urbanised Hellenistic civilisation, and the western territories, which in contrast largely adopted the Latin language. This cultural and linguistic division was eventually reinforced by the later political east–west division of the Roman Empire. The Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire controlled the two divergent regions between the 3rd and the 5th centuries.

The division between these two was enhanced during late antiquity and the Middle Ages by a number of events. The Western Roman Empire collapsed, starting the Early Middle Ages. By contrast, the Eastern Roman Empire, mostly known as the Greek or Byzantine Empire, survived and even thrived for another 1000 years. The rise of the Carolingian Empire in the west, and in particular the Great Schism between Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism, enhanced the cultural and religious distinctiveness between Eastern and Western Europe.

After the conquest of the Byzantine Empire, center of the Eastern Orthodox Church, by the Muslim Ottoman Empire in the 15th century, and the gradual fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire (which had replaced the Carolingian Empire), the division between Roman Catholic and Protestant became more important in Europe than that with Eastern Orthodoxy.

In East Asia, Western Europe was historically known as in China and in Japan, which literally translates as the &quot;Far West&quot;. The term Far West became synonymous with Western Europe in China during the Ming dynasty. The Italian Jesuit priest Matteo Ricci was one of the first writers in China to use the Far West as an Asian counterpart to the European concept of the Far East. In Ricci&#x27;s writings, Ricci referred to himself as &quot;Matteo of the Far West&quot;. The term was still in use in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

===Religion===
Christianity is the largest religion in Western Europe. According to a 2018 study by the Pew Research Center, 71.0% of Western Europeans identified as Christians.

In 1054, the East–West Schism divided Christianity into Western Christianity and Eastern Christianity. This split Europe in two, with Western Europe primarily under the Catholic Church, and Eastern Europe primarily under the Eastern Orthodox Church. Ever since the Reformation in the 16th century, Protestantism has also been a major denomination in Europe, with Eastern Protestant and Eastern Catholic denominations also emerging in Central and Eastern Europe.

===Cold War ===

During the four decades of the Cold War, the definition of East and West was simplified by the existence of the Eastern Bloc. A number of historians and social scientists view the Cold War definition of Western and Eastern Europe as outdated or relegating.

During the final stages of World War II, the future of Europe was decided between the Allies in the 1945 Yalta Conference, between the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, the U.S. President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the Premier of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin.

Post-war Europe was divided into two major spheres: the Western Bloc, influenced by the United States, and the Eastern Bloc, influenced by the Soviet Union. With the onset of the Cold War, Europe was divided by the Iron Curtain. This term had been used during World War II by German Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels and, later, Count Lutz Schwerin von Krosigk in the last days of the war; however, its use was hugely popularised by Winston Churchill, who used it in his famous &quot;Sinews of Peace&quot; address on 5 March 1946 at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri:

Although some countries were officially neutral, they were classified according to the nature of their political and economic systems. This division largely defines the popular perception and understanding of Western Europe and its borders with Eastern Europe on the east side. On the western side is the Atlantic ocean.

The world changed dramatically with the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989. West Germany peacefully absorbed East Germany, in the German reunification. Comecon and the Warsaw Pact were dissolved, and in 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist. Several countries which had been part of the Soviet Union regained full independence.

===Western European Union===

In 1948 the Treaty of Brussels was signed between Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. It was further revisited in 1954 at the Paris Conference, when the Western European Union was established. It was declared defunct in 2011 after the Treaty of Lisbon, and the Treaty of Brussels was terminated. When the Western European Union was dissolved, it had 10 member countries. Additionally, it had 6 associate member countries, 7 associate partner countries and 5 observer countries.

==Modern divisions==

===UN geoscheme classification===
The United Nations geoscheme is a system devised by the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) which divides the countries of the world into regional and subregional groups, based on the M49 coding classification. The partition is for statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories.

In the UN geoscheme, the following countries are classified as Western Europe:
* Austria
* Belgium
* France
* Germany
* Liechtenstein
* Luxembourg
* Monaco
* Netherlands
* Switzerland

===CIA classification===
The CIA classifies seven countries as belonging to &quot;Western Europe&quot;:

*Belgium
*France
*Ireland
*Luxembourg
*Monaco
*Netherlands
*United Kingdom

The CIA also classifies three countries as belonging to &quot;Southwestern Europe&quot;:

*Andorra
*Portugal
*Spain

=== EuroVoc classification===

EuroVoc is a multilingual thesaurus maintained by the Publications Office of the European Union. In this thesaurus, the countries of Europe are grouped into sub-regions. The following countries are included in the sub-group Western Europe:
* Andorra
* Austria
* Belgium
* France
* Germany
* Ireland
* Liechtenstein
* Luxembourg
* Monaco
* Netherlands
* Switzerland
* United Kingdom

===UN regional groups: Western European and Others Group===

The Western European and Others Group is one of several unofficial Regional Groups in the United Nations that act as voting blocs and negotiation forums. Regional voting blocs were formed in 1961 to encourage voting to various UN bodies from different regional groups. The European members of the group are:

*Andorra
*Austria
*Belgium
*Denmark
*Finland
*France
*Germany
*Greece
*Iceland
*Ireland
*Italy
*Liechtenstein
*Luxembourg
*Malta
*Monaco
*Netherlands
*Norway
*Portugal
*San Marino
*Spain
*Sweden
*Switzerland
*Turkey
*United Kingdom
In addition, Australia, Canada, Israel and New Zealand are members of the group, with the United States as observer.

==Population==
Using the CIA classification strictly would give the following calculation of Western Europe&#x27;s population. All figures based on the projections for 2018 by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.

Using the CIA classification a little more liberally and including &quot;South-Western Europe&quot;, would give the following calculation of Western Europe&#x27;s population.

1 

==Climate==

The climate of Western Europe varies from Mediterranean in the coasts of Italy, Portugal and Spain to alpine in the Pyrenees and the Alps. The Mediterranean climate of the south is dry and warm. The western and northwestern parts have a mild, generally humid climate, influenced by the North Atlantic Current. Western Europe is a heatwave hotspot, exhibiting upward trends that are three-to-four times faster compared to the rest of the northern midlatitudes.

==Languages==

Western European languages mostly fall within two Indo-European language families: the Romance languages, descended from the Latin of the Roman Empire; and the Germanic languages, whose ancestor language (Proto-Germanic) came from southern Scandinavia.
Romance languages are spoken primarily in the southern and central part of Western Europe, Germanic languages in the northern part (the British Isles and the Low Countries), as well as a large part of Northern and Central Europe.

Other Western European languages include the Celtic group (that is, Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Manx, Welsh, Cornish and Breton) and Basque, the only currently living European language isolate.

Multilingualism and the protection of regional and minority languages are recognised political goals in Western Europe today. The Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the Council of Europe&#x27;s European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages set up a legal framework for language rights in Europe.

==Economy==
Western Europe is one of the richest regions of the world. Germany has the highest gross domestic product in Europe and the largest financial surplus of any country, Luxembourg has the world&#x27;s highest GDP per capita, and Germany has the highest net national wealth of any European state.

Switzerland and Luxembourg have the highest average wage in the world, in nominal and PPP, respectively. Norway ranks highest in the world on the Social Progress Index.

<doc id="33802" wikidata="Q9410" url="?curid=33802" title="Werewolf">
<text>In folklore, a werewolf (), or occasionally lycanthrope ( ), is an individual who can shape-shift into a wolf, or especially in modern film, a therianthropic hybrid wolf-like creature, either purposely or after being placed under a curse or affliction, often a bite or the occasional scratch from another werewolf, with the transformations occurring on the night of a full moon. Early sources for belief in this ability or affliction, called lycanthropy, are Petronius (27–66) and Gervase of Tilbury (1150–1228).

The werewolf is a widespread concept in European folklore, existing in many variants, which are related by a common development of a Christian interpretation of underlying European folklore developed during the medieval period. From the early modern period, werewolf beliefs spread to the New World with colonialism. Belief in werewolves developed in parallel to the belief in witches, during the Late Middle Ages and the early modern period. Like the witchcraft trials as a whole, the trial of supposed werewolves emerged in what is now Switzerland, especially the Valais and Vaud, in the early 15th century and spread throughout Europe in the 16th, peaking in the 17th and subsiding by the 18th century.

The persecution of werewolves and the associated folklore is an integral part of the &quot;witch-hunt&quot; phenomenon, albeit a marginal one, accusations of lycanthropy being involved in only a small fraction of witchcraft trials. During the early period, accusations of lycanthropy (transformation into a wolf) were mixed with accusations of wolf-riding or wolf-charming. The case of Peter Stumpp (1589) led to a significant peak in both interest in and persecution of supposed werewolves, primarily in French-speaking and German-speaking Europe. The phenomenon persisted longest in Bavaria and Austria, with persecution of wolf-charmers recorded until well after 1650, the final cases taking place in the early 18th century in Carinthia and Styria.

After the end of the witch trials, the werewolf became of interest in folklore studies and in the emerging Gothic horror genre. Werewolf fiction as a genre has premodern precedents in medieval romances (e.g., &quot;Bisclavret&quot; and &quot;&quot;) and developed in the 18th century out of the &quot;semi-fictional&quot; chapbook tradition. The trappings of horror literature in the 20th century became part of the horror and fantasy genre of modern popular culture.

The Modern English &quot;werewolf&quot; descends from the Old English &quot;wer(e)wulf&quot;, which is a cognate of Middle Dutch &quot;weerwolf&quot;, Middle Low German &quot;warwulf&quot;, &quot;werwulf&quot;, Middle High German &quot;werwolf&quot;, and West Frisian &quot;waer-ûl(e)&quot;. These terms are generally derived from a Proto-Germanic form reconstructed as &quot;*wira-wulfaz&quot; (&#x27;man-wolf&#x27;), itself from an earlier Pre-Germanic form *&quot;wiro-wulpos&quot;. An alternative reconstruction, *&quot;wazi-wulfaz&quot; (&#x27;wolf-clothed&#x27;), would bring the Germanic compound closer to the Slavic meaning, with other semantic parallels in Old Norse &quot;úlfheðnar&quot; (&#x27;wolf-skinned&#x27;) and &quot;úlfheðinn&quot; (&#x27;wolf-coat&#x27;), Old Irish &quot;luchthonn&quot; (&#x27;wolf-skin&#x27;), and Sanskrit &quot;Vṛkājina&quot; (&#x27;Wolf-skin&#x27;).

The Norse branch underwent taboo modifications, with Old Norse &quot;vargúlfr&quot; (only attested as a translation of Old French &quot;garwaf&quot; ~ &quot;garwal(f)&quot; from Marie&#x27;s lay of Bisclavret) replacing *&quot;wiraz&quot; (&#x27;man&#x27;) with &quot;vargr&quot; (&#x27;wolf, outlaw&#x27;), perhaps under the influence of the Old French expression &quot;leus warous ~ lous garous&quot; (modern &quot;loup-garou&quot;), which literally means &#x27;wolf-werewolf&#x27;. The modern Norse form &quot;varulv&quot; (Danish, Norwegian and Swedish) was either borrowed from Middle Low German &quot;werwulf&quot;, or else derived from an unattested Old Norse &quot;*varulfr&quot;, posited as the regular descendant of Proto-Germanic *&quot;wira-wulfaz&quot;. An Old Frankish form &quot;*werwolf&quot; is inferred from the Middle Low German variant and was most likely borrowed into Old Norman &quot;garwa(l)f&quot; ~ &quot;garo(u)l&quot;, with regular Germanic–Romance correspondence &quot;w-&quot; / &quot;g-&quot; (cf. &quot;William&quot; / &quot;Guillaume&quot;, &quot;Wales&quot; / &quot;Galles&quot;, etc.).

The Proto-Slavic noun *&quot;vьlko-dlakь&quot;, meaning &quot;wolf-haired&quot; (cf. *&quot;dlaka&quot;, &quot;animal hair&quot;, &quot;fur&quot;), can be reconstructed from Serbian &quot;vukòdlak&quot;, Slovenian &quot;vołkodlȃk&quot;, and Czech &quot;vlkodlak&quot;, although formal variations in Slavic languages (*&quot;vьrdl(j)ak&quot;, *&quot;vьlkdolk&quot;, *&quot;vьlklak&quot;) and the late attestation of some forms pose difficulties in tracing the origin of the term. The Greek &quot;Vrykolakas&quot; and Romanian &quot;Vîrcolac&quot;, designating vampire-like creatures in Balkan folklores, were borrowed from Slavic languages.

The same form is found in other non-Slavic languages of the region, such as Albanian &quot;vurvolak&quot; and Turkish &quot;vurkolak.&quot; Bulgarian &quot;vьrkolak&quot; and Church Slavonic &quot;vurkolak&quot; may be interpreted as back-borrowings from Greek. The name &quot;vurdalak&quot; (вурдалак; &#x27;ghoul, revenant&#x27;) first appeared in Russian poet Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s work &quot;Pesni&quot;, published in 1835. The source of Pushkin&#x27;s distinctive form remains debated in scholarship.

A Proto-Celtic noun *&quot;wiro-kū&quot;, meaning &#x27;man-dog&#x27;, has been reconstructed from Celtiberian &quot;uiroku&quot;, the Old Brittonic place-name &quot;Viroconium&quot; (&lt; *&quot;wiroconion&quot;, &#x27;place of man-dogs, i.e. werewolves&#x27;), the Old Irish noun &quot;ferchu&quot; (&#x27;male dog, fierce dog&#x27;), and the medieval personal names &quot;Guurci&quot; (Old Welsh) and &quot;Gurki&quot; (Old Breton). Wolves were metaphorically designated as &#x27;dogs&#x27; in Celtic cultures.

The modern term &quot;lycanthropy&quot; comes from Ancient Greek &quot;lukanthrōpía&quot; (λυκανθρωπία), itself from &quot;lukánthrōpos&quot; (λυκάνθρωπος), meaning &#x27;wolf-man&#x27;. Ancient writers used the term solely in the context of clinical lycanthropy, a condition in which the patient imagined himself to be a wolf. Modern writers later used &quot;lycanthrope&quot; as a synonym of &quot;werewolf&quot;, referring to a person who, according to medieval superstition, could assume the form of wolves.

== History ==
=== Indo-European comparative mythology ===

The European motif of the devilish werewolf devouring human flesh harks back to a common development during the Middle Ages in the context of Christianity, although stories of humans turning into wolves take their roots in earlier pre-Christian beliefs.

Their underlying common origin can be traced back to Proto-Indo-European mythology, where &quot;lycanthropy&quot; is reconstructed as an aspect of the initiation of the &quot;kóryos&quot; warrior class, which may have included a cult focused on dogs and wolves identified with an age grade of young, unmarried warriors. The standard comparative overview of this aspect of Indo-European mythology is McCone (1987).

=== Classical antiquity ===
A few references to men changing into wolves are found in Ancient Greek literature and Folklore. Herodotus, in his &quot;Histories&quot;, wrote that according to what the Scythians and the Greeks settled in Scythia told him, the Neuri, which was a tribe to the north-east of Scythia, were all transformed into wolves once every year for several days and then changed back to their human shape. He added that he is not convinced by the story but the locals swear to its truth. This tale was also mentioned by Pomponius Mela.

In the second century BC, the Greek geographer Pausanias related the story of King Lycaon of Arcadia, who was transformed into a wolf because he had sacrificed a child in the altar of Zeus Lycaeus. In the version of the legend told by Ovid in his &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, when Zeus visits Lycaon disguised as a common man, Lycaon wants to test if he is really a god. To that end, he kills a Molossian hostage and serve his entrails to Zeus. Disgusted, the god turns Lycaon into a wolf. However, in other accounts of the legend, like that of Apollodorus&#x27; &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, Zeus blasts him and his sons with thunderbolts as punishment.

Pausanias also relates the story of an Arcadian man called Damarchus of Parrhasia, who was turned into a wolf after tasting the entrails of a human child sacrificed to Zeus Lycaeus. He was restored to human form 10 years later and went on to become an Olympic champion. This tale is also recounted by Pliny the Elder, who calls the man Demaenetus quoting Agriopas. According to Pausanias, this was not a one-off event, but that men have been transformed into wolves during the sacrifices to Zeus Lycaeus since the time of Lycaon. If they abstain from tasting human flesh while being wolves, they would be restored to human form nine years later, but if they do not abstain, they would remain wolves forever.

Lykos (Λύκος) of Athens was a wolf-shaped herο, whose shrine stood by the jurycourt, and the first jurors were named after him.

Pliny the Elder likewise recounts another tale of lycanthropy. Quoting Euanthes, he mentions that in Arcadia, once a year a man was chosen by lot from the Anthus&#x27; clan. The chosen man was escorted to a marsh in the area, where he hung his clothes into an oak tree, swam across the marsh and transformed into a wolf, joining a pack for nine years. If during these nine years he refrained from tasting human flesh, he returned to the same marsh, swam back, and recovered his previous human form, with nine years added to his appearance. Ovid also relates stories of men who roamed the woods of Arcadia in the form of wolves.

Virgil, in his poetic work &quot;Eclogues&quot;, wrote about a man called Moeris, who used herbs and poisons picked in his native Pontus to turn himself into a wolf. In prose, the &quot;Satyricon&quot;, written circa AD 60 by Gaius Petronius Arbiter, one of the characters, Niceros, tells a story at a banquet about a friend who turned into a wolf (chs. 61–62). He describes the incident as follows, 

Early Christian authors also mentioned werewolves. In &quot;The City of God&quot;, Augustine of Hippo gives an account similar to that found in Pliny the Elder. Augustine explains that Physical metamorphosis was also mentioned in the &quot;Capitulatum Episcopi&quot;, attributed to the Council of Ancyra in the 4th century, which became the Church&#x27;s doctrinal text in relation to magic, witches, and transformations such as those of werewolves. The &quot;Capitulatum Episcopi&quot; states that 

In these works of Roman writers, werewolves often receive the name &quot;versipellis&quot; (&quot;turnskin&quot;). Augustine instead uses the phrase &quot;in lupum fuisse mutatum&quot; (changed into the form of a wolf) to describe the physical metamorphosis of werewolves, which is similar to phrases used in the medieval period.

=== Middle Ages ===
There is evidence of widespread belief in werewolves in medieval Europe. This evidence spans much of the Continent, as well as the British Isles. Werewolves were mentioned in Medieval law codes, such as that of King Cnut, whose &quot;Ecclesiastical Ordinances&quot; inform us that the codes aim to ensure that Liutprand of Cremona reports a rumor that Bajan, son of Simeon I of Bulgaria, could use magic to turn himself into a wolf. The works of Augustine of Hippo had a large influence on the development of Western Christianity, and were widely read by churchmen of the medieval period. These churchmen occasionally discussed werewolves in their works. Famous examples include Gerald of Wales&#x27;s &quot;Werewolves of Ossory&quot;, found in his &quot;Topographica Hibernica&quot;, and in Gervase of Tilbury&#x27;s &quot;Otia Imperiala,&quot; both written for royal audiences.

Gervase reveals to the reader that belief in such transformations (he also mentions women turning into cats and into snakes) was widespread across Europe; he uses the phrase when discussing these metamorphoses, which translates to &quot;it is known&quot;. Gervase, who was writing in Germany, also tells the reader that the transformation of men into wolves cannot be easily dismissed, for ().

Further evidence of the widespread belief in werewolves and other human-animal transformations can be seen in theological attacks made against such beliefs. Conrad of Hirsau, writing in the 11th century, forbids the reading of stories in which a person&#x27;s reason is obscured following such a transformation. Conrad specifically refers to the tales of Ovid in his tract. Pseudo-Augustine, writing in the 12th century, follows Augustine of Hippo&#x27;s argument that no physical transformation can be made by any but God, stating that 

Marie de France&#x27;s poem &quot;Bisclavret&quot; () is another example, in which the eponymous nobleman Bisclavret, for reasons not described, had to transform into a wolf every week. When his treacherous wife stole his clothing needed to restore his human form, he escaped the king&#x27;s wolf hunt by imploring the king for mercy, and accompanied the king thereafter. His behavior at court was gentle, until his wife and her new husband appeared at court, so much so that his hateful attack on the couple was deemed justly motivated, and the truth was revealed.

This &quot;lai&quot; (a type of Breton sung-poem) follows many themes found within other werewolf tales – the removal of clothing and attempting to refrain from the consumption of human flesh can be found in Pliny the Elder, as well as in the second of Gervase of Tilbury&#x27;s werewolf stories, about a werewolf by the name of Chaucevaire. Marie also reveals to us the existence of werewolf belief in Breton and Norman France, by telling us the Franco-Norman word for werewolf: &quot;garwulf,&quot; which, she explains, are common in that part of France, where . Gervase supports this terminology when he tells us that the French use the term &quot;gerulfi&quot; to describe what the English call &quot;werewolves&quot;. &quot;Melion&quot; and &quot;Biclarel&quot; are two anonymous lais that share the theme of a werewolf knight being betrayed by his wife.

The German word &quot;werwolf&quot; was recorded by Burchard von Worms in the 11th century and Bertold of Regensburg in the 13th century, but is not recorded in all of medieval German poetry or fiction. While Baring-Gould argues that references to werewolves were rare in England, presumably because whatever significance the &quot;wolf-men&quot; of Germanic paganism had carried, the associated beliefs and practices had been successfully repressed after Christianization, or if they persisted, they did so outside of the sphere of literacy available to us. We have sources other than those mentioned above. Such examples of werewolves in Ireland and the British Isles can be found in the work of the 9th century Welsh monk Nennius. Female werewolves appear in the Irish work &quot;Tales of the Elders&quot;, from the 12th century, and Welsh werewolves in the 12th to 13th century work, &quot;Mabinogion.&quot;
Germanic pagan traditions associated with wolf-men persisted longest in the Scandinavian Viking Age. Harald I of Norway is known to have had a body of &quot;Úlfhednar&quot; (wolf-coated [men]), which are mentioned in the Vatnsdœla, Haraldskvæði, and the Völsunga saga, and resemble some werewolf legends. The Úlfhednar were fighters similar to the berserkers, though they dressed in wolf hides rather than those of bears and were reputed to channel the spirits of these animals to enhance effectiveness in battle. These warriors were resistant to pain and killed viciously in battle, much like wild animals. Úlfhednar and berserkers are closely associated with the Norse god Odin.

The Scandinavian traditions of this period may have spread to Kievan Rus&#x27;, giving rise to the Slavic &quot;werewolf&quot; tales. The 11th-century Belarusian Prince Vseslav of Polotsk was considered to have been a werewolf, capable of moving at superhuman speeds, as recounted in &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot;:

The situation as described during the medieval period gives rise to the dual form of werewolf folklore in Early Modern Europe. On one hand the Germanic werewolf, which becomes associated with the witchcraft panic, and on the other hand the Slavic werewolf or &quot;&quot;, which becomes associated with the concept of the revenant or vampire. The eastern werewolf-vampire is found in the folklore of Central and Eastern Europe, including Hungary, Romania and the Balkans, while the western werewolf-sorcerer is found in France, German-speaking Europe and in the Baltic.
Being a werewolf was a common accusation in witch trials. It featured in the Valais witch trials, one of the earliest such trials, in the first half of the 15th century.

In 1539, Martin Luther used the form &quot;beerwolf&quot; to describe a hypothetical ruler worse than a tyrant who must be resisted.

In &#x27;Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus&#x27; (1555), Olaus Magnus describes (Book 18, Chapter 45) an annual assembly of werewolves near the Lithuania-Courland border. The participants, including Lithuanian nobility and werewolves from the surrounding areas, gather to test their strength by attempting to jump over a castle wall&#x27;s ruins. Those who succeed are regarded as strong, while weaker participants are punished with whippings.

=== Early modern history ===

There were numerous reports of werewolf attacks – and consequent court trials – in 16th-century France. In some of the cases there was clear evidence against the accused of murder and cannibalism, but no association with wolves. In other cases people have been terrified by such creatures, such as that of Gilles Garnier in Dole in 1573, who was convicted of being a werewolf.

A peak of attention to lycanthropy came in the late 16th to early 17th century, as part of the European witch-hunts.
A number of treatises on werewolves were written in France during 1595 and 1615. In 1598, werewolves were sighted in Anjou. In 1602, Henry Boguet wrote a lengthy chapter about werewolves. In 1603, a teenage werewolf was sentenced to life imprisonment in Bordeaux.

In the Swiss Vaud region, werewolves were convicted in 1602 and in 1624. A treatise by a Vaud pastor in 1653, however, argued that lycanthropy was purely an illusion. After this, the only further record from the Vaud dates to 1670. A boy claimed he and his mother could change themselves into wolves, which was not taken seriously. At the beginning of the 17th century witchcraft was prosecuted by James I of England, who regarded &quot;warwoolfes&quot; as victims of delusion induced by &quot;a natural superabundance of melancholic&quot;.

After 1650, belief in lycanthropy had mostly disappeared from French-speaking Europe, as evidenced in Diderot&#x27;s Encyclopedia, which attributed reports of lycanthropy to a &quot;disorder of the brain&quot;. Although there were continuing reports of extraordinary wolflike beasts, they were not considered to be werewolves. One such report concerned the Beast of Gévaudan, which terrorized the general area of the former province of Gévaudan, now called Lozère, in south-central France. From 1764 to 1767, it killed upwards of 80 men, women, and children.

The part of Europe which showed more vigorous interest in werewolves after 1650 was the Holy Roman Empire. At least nine works on lycanthropy were printed in Germany between 1649 and 1679. In the Austrian and Bavarian Alps, belief in werewolves persisted well into the 18th century. As late as in 1853, in Galicia, northwestern Spain, Manuel Blanco Romasanta was judged and condemned as the author of a number of murders, but he claimed to be not guilty because of his condition of &quot;lobishome&quot;, werewolf.

Until the 20th century, wolf attacks on humans were an occasional, but still widespread, feature of life in Europe.
Some scholars have suggested that it was inevitable that wolves, being the most feared predators in Europe, were projected into the folklore of evil shapeshifters. This is said to be corroborated by the fact that areas devoid of wolves typically use different kinds of predator to fill the niche; &quot;werehyenas&quot; in Africa, &quot;weretigers&quot; in India, as well as &quot;werepumas&quot; (&quot;runa uturuncu&quot;) and &quot;werejaguars&quot; (&quot;yaguaraté-abá&quot; or &quot;tigre-capiango&quot;) in southern South America.

An idea is explored in Sabine Baring-Gould&#x27;s work &quot;The Book of Werewolves&quot; is that werewolf legends may have been used to explain serial killings. Perhaps the most infamous example is the case of Peter Stumpp, executed in 1589, the German farmer, and alleged serial killer and cannibal, also known as the Werewolf of Bedburg.

=== Asian cultures ===

Common Turkic folklore holds a different, reverential light to the werewolf legends in that Turkic Central Asian shamans after performing long and arduous rites would voluntarily be able to transform into the humanoid &quot;Kurtadam&quot; (literally meaning &quot;Wolfman&quot;). Since the wolf was the totemic ancestor animal of the Turkic peoples, they would be respectful of any shaman who was in such a form.

== Lycanthropy as a medical condition ==

Some modern researchers have tried to explain the reports of werewolf behaviour with recognised medical conditions. In 1963, Dr Lee Illis of Guy&#x27;s Hospital in London wrote a paper entitled &quot;On Porphyria and the Aetiology of Werewolves&quot;, in which he argues that historical accounts on werewolves could have been referring to victims of congenital porphyria, stating how the symptoms of photosensitivity, reddish teeth, and psychosis could have been grounds for accusing a person of being a werewolf.

This is argued against by Woodward, who points out how mythological werewolves were almost invariably portrayed as resembling true wolves, and that their human forms were rarely physically conspicuous as porphyria victims. Others have pointed out the possibility of historical werewolves having been people with hypertrichosis, a hereditary condition manifesting itself in excessive hair growth. Woodward dismissed the possibility, as the rarity of the disease ruled it out from happening on a large scale, as werewolf cases were in medieval Europe.

Woodward suggested rabies as the origin of werewolf beliefs, claiming remarkable similarities between the symptoms of that disease and some of the legends. Woodward focused on the idea that being bitten by a werewolf could result in the victim turning into one, which suggested the idea of a transmittable disease like rabies. However, the idea that lycanthropy could be transmitted in this way is not part of the original myths and legends, and only appears in relatively recent beliefs. Lycanthropy can also be met with as the main content of a delusion, for example, the case of a woman has been reported who during episodes of acute psychosis complained of becoming four different species of animals.

== Folk beliefs ==
=== Characteristics ===
The beliefs classed together under lycanthropy are far from uniform, and the term is somewhat capriciously applied. The transformation may be temporary or permanent; the were-animal may be the man himself metamorphosed; may be his double whose activity leaves the real man to all appearance unchanged; may be his soul, which goes forth seeking whomever it may devour, leaving its body in a state of trance; or it may be no more than the messenger of the human being, a real animal or a familiar spirit, whose intimate connection with its owner is shown by the fact that any injury to it is believed, by a phenomenon known as repercussion, to cause a corresponding injury to the human being.

Werewolves were said in European folklore to bear tell-tale physical traits even in their human form. These included the meeting of both eyebrows at the bridge of the nose, curved fingernails, low-set ears and a swinging stride. One method of identifying a werewolf in its human form was to cut the flesh of the accused, under the pretense that fur would be seen within the wound. A Russian superstition recalls a werewolf can be recognized by bristles under the tongue.

The appearance of a werewolf in its animal form varies from culture to culture. It is most commonly portrayed as being indistinguishable from ordinary wolves, except for the fact that it has no tail (a trait thought characteristic of witches in animal form), is often larger, and retains human eyes and a voice. According to some Swedish accounts, the werewolf could be distinguished from a regular wolf by the fact that it would run on three legs, stretching the fourth one backwards to look like a tail.

After returning to their human forms, werewolves are usually documented as becoming weak, debilitated and undergoing painful nervous depression.
One universally reviled trait in medieval Europe was the werewolf&#x27;s habit of devouring recently buried corpses, a trait that is documented extensively, particularly in the &quot;Annales Medico-psychologiques&quot; in the 19th century.

=== Becoming a werewolf ===
Various methods for becoming a werewolf have been reported, one of the simplest being the removal of clothing and putting on a belt made of wolfskin, probably as a substitute for the assumption of an entire animal skin (which also is frequently described). In other cases, the body is rubbed with a magic salve.

The 16th-century Swedish writer Olaus Magnus says that the Livonian werewolves were initiated by draining a cup of specially prepared beer and repeating a set formula. Ralston in his &quot;Songs of the Russian People&quot; gives the form of incantation still familiar in Russia. In Italy, France and Germany, it was said that a man or woman could turn into a werewolf if he or she, on a certain Wednesday or Friday, slept outside on a summer night with the full moon shining directly on his or her face.

In other cases, the transformation was supposedly accomplished by Satanic allegiance for the most loathsome ends, often for the sake of sating a craving for human flesh. &quot;The werewolves&quot;, writes Richard Verstegan (&quot;Restitution of Decayed Intelligence&quot;, 1628),

The phenomenon of repercussion, the power of animal metamorphosis, or of sending out a familiar, real or spiritual, as a messenger, and the supernormal powers conferred by association with such a familiar, are also attributed to the magician, male and female, all the world over; and witch superstitions are closely parallel to, if not identical with, lycanthropic beliefs, the occasional involuntary character of lycanthropy being almost the sole distinguishing feature. In another direction the phenomenon of repercussion is asserted to manifest itself in connection with the bush-soul of the West African and the &quot;nagual&quot; of Central America; but though there is no line of demarcation to be drawn on logical grounds, the assumed power of the magician and the intimate association of the bush-soul or the &quot;nagual&quot; with a human being are not termed lycanthropy.

The curse of lycanthropy was also considered by some scholars as being a divine punishment. Werewolf literature shows many examples of God or saints allegedly cursing those who invoked their wrath with lycanthropy. Such is the case of Lycaon, who was turned into a wolf by Zeus as punishment for slaughtering one of his own sons and serving his remains to the gods as a dinner. Those who were excommunicated by the Roman Catholic Church were also said to become werewolves.

The power of transforming others into wild beasts was attributed not only to malignant sorcerers, but to Christian saints as well. &quot;Omnes angeli, boni et Mali, ex virtute naturali habent potestatem transmutandi corpora nostra&quot; (&quot;All angels, good and bad, have the power of transmutating our bodies&quot;) was the dictum of St. Thomas Aquinas. St. Patrick was said to have transformed the Welsh King Vereticus into a wolf; Natalis supposedly cursed an illustrious Irish family whose members were each doomed to be a wolf for seven years. In other tales the divine agency is even more direct, while in Russia, again, men supposedly became werewolves when incurring the wrath of the Devil.

A notable exception to the association of Lycanthropy and the Devil, comes from a rare and lesser known account of an 80-year-old man named Thiess. In 1692, in Jürgensburg, Livonia, Thiess testified under oath that he and other werewolves were the Hounds of God.
He claimed they were warriors who descended into hell to battle witches and demons. Their efforts ensured that the Devil and his minions did not carry off the grain from local failed crops down to hell. Thiess was ultimately sentenced to ten lashes for idolatry and superstitious belief.

=== Remedies ===
Various methods have existed for removing the werewolf form. In antiquity, the Ancient Greeks and Romans believed in the power of exhaustion in curing people of lycanthropy. The victim would be subjected to long periods of physical activity in the hope of being purged of the malady. This practice stemmed from the fact that many alleged werewolves would be left feeling weak and debilitated after committing depredations.

In medieval Europe, traditionally, there are three methods one can use to cure a victim of lycanthropy; medicinally (usually via the use of wolfsbane), surgically, or by exorcism. Many of the cures advocated by medieval medical practitioners proved fatal to the patients. A Sicilian belief of Arabic origin holds that a werewolf can be cured of its ailment by striking it on the forehead or scalp with a knife. Another belief from the same culture involves the piercing of the werewolf&#x27;s hands with nails. Sometimes, less extreme methods were used. In the German lowland of Schleswig-Holstein, a werewolf could be cured if one were to simply address it three times by its Christian name. One Danish belief holds that merely scolding a werewolf will cure it. Conversion to Christianity was a common method of removing lycanthropy in the medieval period. A devotion to St. Hubert has been cited as both cure for and protection from lycanthropes.

=== Connection to revenants ===

Before the end of the 19th century, the Greeks believed that the corpses of werewolves, if not destroyed, would return to life in the form of wolves or hyenas that prowled battlefields, drinking the blood of dying soldiers. In the same vein, in some rural areas of Germany, Poland, and Northern France, it was once believed that people who died in mortal sin came back to life as blood-drinking wolves.
These &quot;undead&quot; werewolves would return to their human corpse form at daylight. They were dealt with by decapitation with a spade and exorcism by the parish priest. The head would then be thrown into a stream, where the weight of its sins was thought to weigh it down. Sometimes, the same methods used to dispose of ordinary vampires would be used. The vampire was linked to the werewolf in East European countries, particularly Bulgaria, Serbia and Slovenia. In Serbia, the werewolf and vampire are known collectively as &quot;vulkodlak&quot;.

=== Hungary and Balkans ===
In Hungarian folklore, werewolves are said to live in the region of Transdanubia, and it was thought that the ability to change into a wolf was obtained in infancy, after suffering parental abuse or by a curse. It is told that at the age of seven the boy or the girl leave home at night to go hunting, and can change to a person or wolf whenever they want. The curse can also be obtained in adulthood if a person passes three times through an arch made of birch with the help of a wild rose&#x27;s spine.

The werewolves were known to exterminate all kind of farm animals, especially sheep. The transformation usually occurred during the winter solstice, Easter and a full moon. Later in the 17th and 18th century, the trials in Hungary were not only conducted against witches, but against werewolves too, and many records exist documenting connections between the two. Vampires and werewolves are closely related in Hungarian folklore, both being feared in antiquity.

Among the South Slavs, and among the ethnic Kashubian people in present-day northern Poland, there was the belief that if a child was born with hair, a birthmark, or a caul on their head, they were supposed to possess shape-shifting abilities. Though capable of turning into any animal they wished, it was commonly believed that such people preferred to turn into a wolf.

Serbian &quot;vukodlak&quot;s traditionally had the habit of congregating annually in the winter months, when they would strip off their wolf skins and hang them from trees. They would then get a hold of another &quot;vulkodlak&quot;″s skin and burn it, releasing from its curse the &quot;vukodlak&quot; from whom the skin came.

=== Caucasus ===
According to Armenian lore, there are women who, in consequence of deadly sins, are condemned to spend seven years in wolf form. In a typical account, a condemned woman is visited by a wolfskin-toting spirit, who orders her to wear the skin, which causes her to acquire frightful cravings for human flesh soon after. With her better nature overcome, the she-wolf devours each of her own children, then her relatives&#x27; children in order of relationship, and finally the children of strangers. She wanders only at night, with doors and locks springing open at her approach. When morning arrives, she reverts to human form and removes her wolfskin. The transformation is generally said to be involuntary. There are alternate versions involving voluntary metamorphosis, where the women can transform at will.

=== Americas and Caribbean ===
The Naskapis believed that the caribou afterlife is guarded by giant wolves that kill careless hunters venturing too near. The Navajo people feared witches in wolf&#x27;s clothing called &quot;Mai-cob&quot;.
Woodward thought that these beliefs were due to the Norse colonization of the Americas.
When the European colonization of the Americas occurred, the pioneers brought their own werewolf folklore with them and were later influenced by the lore of their neighbouring colonies and those of the Natives. Belief in the &quot;loup-garou&quot; present in Canada, the Upper and Lower Peninsulas of Michigan, and upstate New York originates from French folklore influenced by Native American stories on the Wendigo.

In Mexico, there is a belief in a creature called the &quot;nagual&quot;. In Haiti, there is a superstition that werewolf spirits known locally as &quot;Jé-rouge&quot; (red eyes) can possess the bodies of unwitting persons and nightly transform them into cannibalistic lupine creatures. The Haitian &quot;jé-rouges&quot; typically try to trick mothers into giving away their children voluntarily by waking them at night and asking their permission to take their child, to which the disoriented mother may either reply yes or no. The Haitian &quot;jé-rouges&quot; differ from traditional European werewolves by their habit of actively trying to spread their lycanthropic condition to others, much like vampires.

== Modern reception ==
=== Werewolf fiction ===
Most modern fiction describes werewolves as vulnerable to silver weapons and highly resistant to other injuries. This feature appears in German folklore of the 19th century. The claim that the Beast of Gévaudan, an 18th-century wolf or wolflike creature, was shot by a silver bullet appears to have been introduced by novelists retelling the story from 1935 onwards and not in earlier versions.

English folklore, prior to 1865, showed shapeshifters to be vulnerable to silver: the city of Greifswald, Germany was infested by werewolves. 

The 1897 novel &quot;Dracula&quot; and the short story &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Guest&quot;, both written by Bram Stoker, drew on earlier mythologies of werewolves and similar legendary demons and &quot;was to voice the anxieties of an age&quot;, and the &quot;fears of late Victorian patriarchy&quot;. In &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Guest&quot;, a band of military horsemen coming to the aid of the protagonist chase off Dracula, depicted as a great wolf stating the only way to kill it is by a &quot;Sacred Bullet&quot;. This is also mentioned in the main novel Dracula as well. Count Dracula stated in the novel that legends of werewolves originated from his Szekely racial bloodline, who himself is also depicted with the ability to shapeshift into a wolf at will during the night but is unable to do so during the day except at noon.

The 1928 novel &quot;The Wolf&#x27;s Bride: A Tale from Estonia&quot;, written by the Finnish author Aino Kallas, tells story of the forester Priidik&#x27;s wife Aalo living in Hiiumaa in the 17th century, who became a werewolf under the influence of a malevolent forest spirit, also known as &quot;Diabolus Sylvarum&quot;.

The first feature film to use an anthropomorphic werewolf was &quot;Werewolf of London&quot; in 1935. The main werewolf of this film is a dapper London scientist who retains some of his style and most of his human features after his transformation, as lead actor Henry Hull was unwilling to spend long hours being made up by makeup artist Jack Pierce. Universal Studios drew on a Balkan tale of a plant associated with lycanthropy as there was no literary work to draw upon, unlike the case with vampires. There is no reference to silver nor other aspects of werewolf lore such as cannibalism.

A more tragic character is Lawrence Talbot, played by Lon Chaney Jr. in 1941&#x27;s &quot;The Wolf Man&quot;. With Pierce&#x27;s makeup more elaborate this time, the movie catapulted the werewolf into public consciousness. Sympathetic portrayals are few but notable, such as the comedic but tortured protagonist David Naughton in &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot;, and a less anguished and more confident and charismatic Jack Nicholson in the 1994 film &quot;Wolf&quot;. Over time, the depiction of werewolves has gone from fully malevolent to even heroic creatures, such as in the &quot;Underworld&quot; and &quot;Twilight&quot; series, as well as &quot;Blood Lad&quot;, &quot;Dance in the Vampire Bund&quot;, &quot;Rosario + Vampire&quot;, and various other movies, anime, manga, and comic books.

Other werewolves are decidedly more willful and malevolent, such as those in the novel &quot;The Howling&quot; and its subsequent sequels and film adaptations. The form a werewolf assumes was generally anthropomorphic in early films such as &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; and &quot;Werewolf of London&quot;, but a larger and powerful wolf in many later films.

Werewolves are often depicted as immune to damage caused by ordinary weapons, being vulnerable only to silver objects, such as a silver-tipped cane, bullet or blade; this attribute was first adopted cinematically in &quot;The Wolf Man&quot;. This negative reaction to silver is sometimes so strong that the mere touch of the metal on a werewolf&#x27;s skin will cause burns. Current-day werewolf fiction almost exclusively involves lycanthropy being either a hereditary condition or transmitted like an infectious disease by the bite of another werewolf.

In some fiction, the power of the werewolf extends to human form, such as invulnerability to conventional injury due to their healing factor, superhuman speed and strength, and falling on their feet from high falls. Aggressiveness and animalistic urges may be intensified and more difficult to control, such as hunger, and sexual arousal. Usually in these cases, the abilities are diminished in human form. In other fiction, it can be cured by medicine men or antidotes.

Along with the vulnerability to the silver bullet, the full moon being the cause of the transformation only became part of the depiction of werewolves on a widespread basis in the twentieth century. The first movie to feature the transformative effect of the full moon was &quot;Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man&quot; in 1943.

Werewolves are typically envisioned as &quot;working-class&quot; monsters, often being low in socio-economic status, although they can represent a variety of social classes and at times were seen as a way of representing &quot;aristocratic decadence&quot; during 19th century horror literature.

=== Nazi Germany ===
Nazi Germany used &quot;Werwolf&quot;, as the mythical creature&#x27;s name is spelled in German, in 1942–43 as the codename for one of Hitler&#x27;s headquarters. In the war&#x27;s final days, the Nazi &quot;Operation Werwolf&quot; aimed at creating a commando force that would operate behind enemy lines as the Allies advanced through Germany itself.

Two fictional depictions of &quot;Operation Werwolf&quot;the US television series &quot;True Blood&quot; and the 2012 novel &quot;Wolf Hunter&quot; by J. L. Benétmix the two meanings of &quot;Werwolf&quot; by depicting the 1945 die-hard Nazi commandos as being actual werewolves.

<doc id="33804" wikidata="Q23661" url="?curid=33804" title="Wellington">
<text>Wellington is the capital city of New Zealand. It is located at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Remutaka Range. Wellington is the third-largest city in New Zealand (second largest in the North Island), and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region. It is the world&#x27;s southernmost capital of a sovereign state. Wellington features a temperate maritime climate, and is the world&#x27;s windiest city by average wind speed.

Māori oral tradition tells that Kupe discovered and explored the region in about the 10th century. The area was initially settled by Māori iwi such as Rangitāne and Muaūpoko. The disruptions of the Musket Wars led to them being overwhelmed by northern iwi such as Te Āti Awa by the early 19th century.

Wellington&#x27;s current form was originally designed by Captain William Mein Smith, the first Surveyor General for Edward Wakefield&#x27;s New Zealand Company, in 1840. Smith&#x27;s plan included a series of interconnected grid plans, expanding along valleys and lower hill slopes. The Wellington urban area, which only includes urbanised areas within Wellington City, has a population of as of . The wider Wellington metropolitan area, including the cities of Lower Hutt, Porirua and Upper Hutt, has a population of as of . The city has served as New Zealand&#x27;s capital since 1865, a status that is not defined in legislation, but established by convention; the New Zealand Government and Parliament, the Supreme Court and most of the public service are based in the city.

Wellington&#x27;s economy is primarily service-based, with an emphasis on finance, business services, government, and the film industry. It is the centre of New Zealand&#x27;s film and special effects industries, and increasingly a hub for information technology and innovation, with two public research universities. Wellington is one of New Zealand&#x27;s chief seaports and serves both domestic and international shipping. The city is chiefly served by Wellington International Airport in Rongotai, the country&#x27;s third-busiest airport. Wellington&#x27;s transport network includes train and bus lines which reach as far as the Kāpiti Coast and the Wairarapa, and ferries connect the city to the South Island.

Often referred to as New Zealand&#x27;s cultural capital, the culture of Wellington is a diverse and often youth-driven one which has wielded influence across Oceania. One of the world&#x27;s most liveable cities, the 2021 Global Livability Ranking tied Wellington with Tokyo as fourth in the world. From 2017 to 2018, Deutsche Bank ranked it first in the world for both livability and non-pollution. Cultural precincts such as Cuba Street and Newtown are renowned for creative innovation, &quot;op shops&quot;, historic character, and food. Wellington is a leading financial centre in the Asia-Pacific region, being ranked 46th in the world by the Global Financial Centres Index for 2024. The global city has grown from a bustling Māori settlement, to a colonial outpost, and from there to an Australasian capital that has experienced a &quot;remarkable creative resurgence&quot;.

==Toponymy==
Wellington takes its name from Arthur Wellesley, the first Duke of Wellington and victor of the Battle of Waterloo (1815): his title comes from the town of Wellington in the English county of Somerset. It was named in November 1840 by the original settlers of the New Zealand Company on the suggestion of the directors of the same, in recognition of the Duke&#x27;s strong support for the company&#x27;s principles of colonisation and his &quot;strenuous and successful defence against its enemies of the measure for colonising South Australia&quot;. One of the founders of the settlement, Edward Jerningham Wakefield, reported that the settlers &quot;took up the views of the directors with great cordiality and the new name was at once adopted&quot;.

In the Māori language, Wellington has three names:
*, meaning &quot;the great harbour of Tara&quot;, refers to Wellington Harbour. The primary settlement of Wellington is said to have been led by Tara, the son of Whatonga, a chief from the Māhia Peninsula, who told his son to travel south, to find more fertile lands to settle.
*, commonly held to be a phonetic Māori transliteration of &quot;Port Nick&quot;, short for &quot;Port Nicholson&quot;. An alternatively suggested etymology for is that it comes from a shortening of the phrase , meaning &quot;journey into the night&quot;, referring to the exodus of Te Āti Awa from the Wellington area after they were displaced by the first European settlers. However, the name Pōneke was already in use by February 1842, earlier than the displacement is said to have happened. The city&#x27;s central marae, the community supporting it and its group have the pseudo-tribal name of Ngāti Pōneke. 
*, meaning &quot;The Head of the Fish of Māui&quot; (often shortened to &quot;Te Upoko-o-te-Ika&quot;), a traditional name for the southernmost part of the North Island, deriving from the legend of the fishing up of the island by the demi-god Māui.

The legendary Māori explorer Kupe, a chief from Hawaiki (the homeland of Polynesian explorers, of unconfirmed geographical location, not to be confused with Hawaii), was said to have stayed in the harbour prior to 1000 CE. Here, it is said he had a notable impact on the area, with local mythology stating he named the two islands in the harbour after his daughters, Matiu (Somes Island), and Mākaro (Ward Island).

In New Zealand Sign Language, the name is signed by raising the index, middle, and ring fingers of one hand, palm forward, to form a &quot;W&quot;, and shaking it slightly from side to side twice.

The city&#x27;s location close to the mouth of the narrow Cook Strait leaves it vulnerable to strong gales, leading to the nickname of &quot;Windy Wellington&quot;.

==History==
===Māori settlement===

Legends recount that Kupe discovered and explored the region in about the 10th century. Before European colonisation, the area in which the city of Wellington would eventually be founded was seasonally inhabited by indigenous Māori. The earliest date with hard evidence for human activity in New Zealand is about 1280.

Wellington and its environs have been occupied by various Māori groups from the 12th century. The legendary Polynesian explorer Kupe, a chief from Hawaiki (the homeland of Polynesian explorers, of unconfirmed geographical location, not to be confused with Hawaii), was said to have stayed in the harbour from . A later Māori explorer, Whatonga, named the harbour &quot;Te Whanganui-a-Tara&quot; after his son Tara. Before the 1820s, most of the inhabitants of the Wellington region were Whatonga&#x27;s descendants.

At about 1820, the people living there were Ngāti Ira and other groups who traced their descent from the explorer Whatonga, including Rangitāne and Muaūpoko. However, these groups were eventually forced out of &quot;Te Whanganui-a-Tara&quot; by a series of migrations by other iwi (Māori tribes) from the north. The migrating groups were Ngāti Toa, which came from Kāwhia, Ngāti Rangatahi, from near Taumarunui, and Te Ātiawa, Ngāti Tama, Ngāti Mutunga, Taranaki and Ngāti Ruanui from Taranaki. Ngāti Mutunga later moved on to the Chatham Islands. The Waitangi Tribunal has found that at the time of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, Te Ātiawa, Taranaki, Ngāti Ruanui, Ngāti Tama, and Ngāti Toa held mana whenua interests in the area, through conquest and occupation.

===Early European settlement===

Steps towards European settlement in the area began in 1839, when Colonel William Wakefield arrived to purchase land for the New Zealand Company to sell to prospective British settlers. Prior to this time, the Māori inhabitants had had contact with Pākehā whalers and traders.

European settlement began with the arrival of an advance party of the New Zealand Company on the ship &quot;Tory&quot; on 20 September 1839, followed by 150 settlers on the &quot;Aurora&quot; on 22 January 1840. Thus, the Wellington settlement preceded the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi (on 6 February 1840). The 1840 settlers constructed their first homes at Petone (which they called Britannia for a time) on the flat area at the mouth of the Hutt River. Within months that area proved swampy and flood-prone, and most of the newcomers transplanted their settlement across Wellington Harbour to Thorndon in the present-day site of Wellington city.

===National capital===
Wellington was declared a city in 1840, and was chosen to be the capital city of New Zealand in 1865.

Wellington became the capital city in place of Auckland, which William Hobson had made the capital in 1841. The New Zealand Parliament had first met in Wellington on 7 July 1862, on a temporary basis; in November 1863, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Alfred Domett, placed a resolution before Parliament in Auckland that &quot;... it has become necessary that the seat of government ... should be transferred to some suitable locality in Cook Strait [region].&quot; There had been some concerns that the more populous South Island (where the goldfields were located) would choose to form a separate colony in the British Empire. Several commissioners (delegates) invited from Australia, chosen for their neutral status, declared that the city was a suitable location because of its central location in New Zealand and its good harbour; it was believed that the whole Royal Navy fleet could fit into the harbour. Wellington&#x27;s status as the capital is a result of constitutional convention rather than statute.

Wellington is New Zealand&#x27;s political centre, housing the nation&#x27;s major government institutions. The New Zealand Parliament relocated to the new capital city, having spent the first ten years of its existence in Auckland. A session of parliament officially met in the capital for the first time on 26 July 1865. At that time, the population of Wellington was just 4,900.

The Government Buildings were constructed at Lambton Quay in 1876. The site housed the original government departments in New Zealand. The public service rapidly expanded beyond the capacity of the building, with the first department leaving shortly after it was opened; by 1975 only the Education Department remained, and by 1990 the building was empty. The capital city is also the location of the highest court, the Supreme Court of New Zealand, and the historic former High Court building (opened 1881) has been enlarged and restored for its use. The Governor-General&#x27;s residence, Government House (the current building completed in 1910) is situated in Newtown, opposite the Basin Reserve. Premier House (built in 1843 for Wellington&#x27;s first mayor, George Hunter), the official residence of the prime minister, is in Thorndon on Tinakori Road.

Over six months in 1939 and 1940, Wellington hosted the New Zealand Centennial Exhibition, celebrating a century since the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. Held on 55 acres of land at Rongotai, it featured three exhibition courts, grand Art Deco-style edifices and a hugely popular three-acre amusement park. Wellington attracted more than 2.5 million visitors at a time when New Zealand&#x27;s population was 1.6 million.

==Geography==

Wellington is at the south-western tip of the North Island on Cook Strait, separating the North and South Islands. On a clear day, the snowcapped Kaikōura Ranges are visible to the south across the strait. To the north stretch the golden beaches of the Kāpiti Coast. On the east, the Remutaka Range divides Wellington from the broad plains of the Wairarapa, a wine region of national notability.

With a latitude of 41° 17&#x27; South, Wellington is the southernmost capital city in the world. Wellington ties with Canberra, Australia, as the most remote capital city, apart from each other.

Wellington is more densely populated than most other cities in New Zealand due to the restricted amount of land that is available between its harbour and the surrounding hills. It has very few open areas in which to expand, and this has brought about the development of the suburban towns. Because of its location in the Roaring Forties and its exposure to the winds blowing through Cook Strait, Wellington is the world&#x27;s windiest city, with an average wind speed of .

Wellington&#x27;s scenic natural harbour and green hillsides adorned with tiered suburbs of colonial villas are popular with tourists. The central business district (CBD) is close to Lambton Harbour, an arm of Wellington Harbour, which lies along an active geological fault, clearly evident on its straight western shore. The land to the west of this rises abruptly, meaning that many suburbs sit high above the centre of the city. There is a network of bush walks and reserves maintained by the Wellington City Council and local volunteers. These include Otari-Wilton&#x27;s Bush, dedicated to the protection and propagation of native plants. The Wellington region has of regional parks and forests. In the east is the Miramar Peninsula, connected to the rest of the city by a low-lying isthmus at Rongotai, the site of Wellington International Airport. Industry has developed mainly in the Hutt Valley, where there are food-processing plants, engineering industries, vehicle assembly and oil refineries.

The narrow entrance to the harbour is to the east of the Miramar Peninsula, and contains the dangerous shallows of Barrett Reef, where many ships have been wrecked (notably the inter-island ferry in 1968). The harbour has three islands: Matiu/Somes Island, Makaro/Ward Island and Mokopuna Island. Only Matiu/Somes Island is large enough for habitation. It has been used as a quarantine station for people and animals, and was an internment camp during World War I and World War II. It is a conservation island, providing refuge for endangered species, much like Kapiti Island farther up the coast. There is access during daylight hours by the Dominion Post Ferry.

Wellington is primarily surrounded by water, but some of the nearby locations are listed below.

===Geology===
Wellington suffered serious damage in a series of earthquakes in 1848 and from another earthquake in 1855. The 1855 Wairarapa earthquake occurred on the Wairarapa Fault to the north and east of Wellington. It was probably the most powerful earthquake in recorded New Zealand history, with an estimated magnitude of at least 8.2 on the Moment magnitude scale. It caused vertical movements of two to three metres over a large area, including raising land out of the harbour and turning it into a tidal swamp. Much of this land was subsequently reclaimed and is now part of the central business district. For this reason, the street named Lambton Quay is 100 to 200 metres (325 to 650 ft) from the harbour – plaques set into the footpath mark the shoreline in 1840, indicating the extent of reclamation. The 1942 Wairarapa earthquakes caused considerable damage in Wellington.

The area has high seismic activity even by New Zealand standards, with a major fault, the Wellington Fault, running through the centre of the city and several others nearby. Several hundred minor faults lines have been identified within the urban area. Inhabitants, particularly in high-rise buildings, typically notice several earthquakes every year. For many years after the 1855 earthquake, the majority of buildings were made entirely from wood. The 1996-restored Government Buildings near Parliament is the largest wooden building in the Southern Hemisphere. While masonry and structural steel have subsequently been used in building construction, especially for office buildings, timber framing remains the primary structural component of almost all residential construction. Residents place their confidence in good building regulations, which became more stringent in the 20th century. Since the Canterbury earthquakes of 2010 and 2011, earthquake readiness has become even more of an issue, with buildings declared by Wellington City Council to be earthquake-prone, and the costs of meeting new standards.

Every five years, a year-long slow quake occurs beneath Wellington, stretching from Kapiti to the Marlborough Sounds. It was first measured in 2003, and reappeared in 2008 and 2013. It releases as much energy as a magnitude 7 quake, but as it happens slowly, there is no damage.

During July and August 2013 there were many earthquakes, mostly in Cook Strait near Seddon. The sequence started at 5:09 pm on Sunday 21 July 2013 when the magnitude 6.5 Seddon earthquake hit the city, but no tsunami report was confirmed nor any major damage. At 2:31 pm on Friday 16 August 2013 the Lake Grassmere earthquake struck, this time magnitude 6.6, but again no major damage occurred, though many buildings were evacuated. On Monday 20 January 2014 at 3:52 pm a rolling 6.2 magnitude earthquake struck the lower North Island 15 km east of Eketāhuna and was felt in Wellington, but little damage was reported initially, except at Wellington Airport where one of the two giant eagle sculptures commemorating The Hobbit became detached from the ceiling.

At two minutes after midnight on Monday 14 November 2016, the 7.8 magnitude Kaikōura earthquake, which was centred between Culverden and Kaikōura in the South Island, caused the Wellington CBD, Victoria University of Wellington, and the Wellington suburban rail network to be largely closed for the day to allow inspections. The earthquake damaged a considerable number of buildings, with 65% of the damage being in Wellington. Subsequently, a number of recent buildings were demolished rather than being rebuilt, often a decision made by the insurer. Two of the buildings demolished were about eleven years old – the seven-storey NZDF headquarters and Statistics House at Centreport on the waterfront. The docks were closed for several weeks after the earthquake.

===Relief===
Steep landforms shape and constrain much of Wellington city. Notable hills in and around Wellington include:
* Mount Victoria – 196 m. Mt Vic is a popular walk for tourists and Wellingtonians alike, as from the summit one can see most of Wellington. There are numerous mountain bike and walking tracks on the hill.
* Mount Albert – 178 m
* Mount Cook
* Mount Alfred (west of Evans Bay) – 122 m
* Mount Kaukau – 445 m. Site of Wellington&#x27;s main television transmitter.
* Mount Crawford
* Brooklyn Hill – 299 m
* Wrights Hill
* Mākara Peak – summit (412m) is within the 250ha Makara Peak Mountain Bike Park that includes 45km of trails
* Te Ahumairangi (Tinakori) Hill

===Climate===
Averaging 2,055 hours of sunshine per year, the climate of Wellington is temperate marine, (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;, Trewartha: &quot;Cflk&quot;), generally moderate all year round with mild summers and cool to mild winters, and rarely sees temperatures above or below . The hottest recorded temperature in the city is recorded on 20 February 1896, while is the coldest. The city is notorious for its southerly blasts in winter, which may make the temperature feel much colder. It is generally very windy all year round with high rainfall; average annual rainfall is , June and July being the wettest months. Frosts are quite common in the hill suburbs and the Hutt Valley between May and September. Snow is very rare at low altitudes, although snow fell on the city and many other parts of the Wellington region during separate events on 25 July 2011 and 15 August 2011. Snow at higher altitudes is more common, with light flurries recorded in higher suburbs every few years.

On 29 January 2019, the suburb of Kelburn (instruments near the old Metservice building in the Wellington Botanic Garden) reached , the highest temperature since records began in 1927.

===Culture and identity===
In addition to governmental institutions, Wellington accommodates several of the nation&#x27;s largest and oldest cultural institutions, such as the National Archives, the National Library, New Zealand&#x27;s national museum, Te Papa and numerous theatres. It plays host to many artistic and cultural organisations, including the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and Royal New Zealand Ballet. Its architectural attractions include the Old Government Buildings – one of the largest wooden buildings in the world – as well as the iconic Beehive, the executive wing of Parliament Buildings as well as internationally renowned Futuna Chapel. The city&#x27;s art scene includes many art galleries, including the national art collection at Toi Art at Te Papa. Wellington also has many events such as CubaDupa, Wellington On a Plate, the Newtown Festival, Diwali Festival of Lights and Gardens Magic at the Botanical Gardens.

==Architecture==
Wellington showcases a variety of architectural styles from the past 150 years – 19th-century wooden cottages, such as the Italianate Katherine Mansfield Birthplace in Thorndon; streamlined Art Deco structures such as the old Wellington Free Ambulance headquarters, the Central Fire Station, Fountain Court Apartments, the City Gallery, and the former Post and Telegraph Building; and the curves and vibrant colours of post-modern architecture in the CBD.

The oldest building is the 1858 Nairn Street Cottage in Mount Cook. The tallest building is the Majestic Centre on Willis Street at 116 metres high, the second-tallest being the structural expressionist Aon Centre (Wellington) at 103 metres. Futuna Chapel in Karori is an iconic building designed by Māori architect John Scott and is architecturally considered one of the most significant New Zealand buildings of the 20th century. Old St Paul&#x27;s is an example of 19th-century Gothic Revival architecture adapted to colonial conditions and materials, as is St Mary of the Angels. Sacred Heart Cathedral is a Palladian Revival Basilica with the Portico of a Roman or Greek temple. The Museum of Wellington City &amp; Sea in the Bond Store is in the Second French Empire style, and the Wellington Harbour Board Wharf Office Building is in a late English Classical style. There are several restored theatre buildings: the St James Theatre, the Opera House and the Embassy Theatre.

Te Ngākau Civic Square is surrounded by the Town Hall and council offices, the Michael Fowler Centre, the Wellington Central Library, the City-to-Sea Bridge, and the City Gallery.

As it is the capital city, there are many notable government buildings. The Executive Wing of New Zealand Parliament Buildings, on the corner of Lambton Quay and Molesworth Street, was constructed between 1969 and 1981 and is commonly referred to as the Beehive. Across the road is the largest wooden building in the Southern Hemisphere, part of the old Government Buildings which now houses part of Victoria University of Wellington&#x27;s Law Faculty.

A modernist building housing the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa lies on the waterfront, on Cable Street. It is strengthened using base isolation – essentially seating the entire building on supports made from lead, steel and rubber that slow down the effect of an earthquake.

Other notable buildings include Wellington Town Hall, Wellington railway station, Dominion Museum (now Massey University), Aon Centre (Wellington), Wellington Regional Stadium, and Wellington Airport at Rongotai. Leading architects include Frederick Thatcher, Frederick de Jersey Clere, W. Gray Young, Bill Alington, Ian Athfield, Roger Walker. Wellington contains many iconic sculptures and structures, such as the Bucket Fountain in Cuba Street and &quot;Invisible City&quot; by Anton Parsons on Lambton Quay. Kinetic sculptures have been commissioned, such as the Zephyrometer. This 26-metre orange spike built for movement by artist Phil Price has been described as &quot;tall, soaring and elegantly simple&quot;, which &quot;reflects the swaying of the yacht masts in the Evans Bay Marina behind it&quot; and &quot;moves like the needle on the dial of a nautical instrument, measuring the speed of the sea or wind or vessel.&quot;

Wellington has many different architectural styles, such as classic Painted Ladies in Mount Victoria, Newtown and Oriental Bay, Wooden Art Deco houses spread throughout (especially further north in the Hutt Valley), the classic masonry buildings in Cuba Street, state houses particularly in the Hutt and Wellington&#x27;s southern suburbs, railway houses in Ngaio and other railway-side suburbs, large modern buildings in the city centre (such as the distinctive skyscraper called the Majestic Centre) and grand Victorian buildings common in the inner city as well.

==Housing and real estate==

=== House prices ===

==== Historic ====
Wellington experienced a real estate boom in the early 2000s and the effects of the international property bust at the start of 2007. In 2005, the market was described as &quot;robust&quot;. By 2008, property values had declined by about 9.3% over a 12-month period, according to one estimate. More expensive properties declined more steeply, sometimes by as much as 20%. &quot;From 2004 to early 2007, rental yields were eroded and positive cash flow in property investments disappeared as house values climbed faster than rents. Then that trend reversed and yields slowly began improving&quot;, according to two &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; reporters writing in May 2009. In the middle of 2009, house prices had dropped, interest rates were low, and buy-to-let property investment was again looking attractive, particularly in the Lambton precinct, according to these two reporters.

==== Current ====
Since 2009, house prices in Wellington have increased significantly. In May 2021, the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand (REINZ) reported the median house price was $1,057,000 in Wellington City, $930,000 in Porirua, $873,500 in Lower Hutt and $828,000 in Upper Hutt, compared to a national median house price of $820,000. 
The substantial increase in house prices has made it difficult for first home buyers to purchase a home in the city and is also credited with pushing up the house prices in neighbouring cities like Porirua. Wellington house prices peaked in February 2022, and by December 2023 had fallen by 25%. 

Housing costs have been identified making it difficult for some professions, like nurses, to afford to live in Wellington. The median rent in Wellington has also increased significantly in recent years to $600 per week, higher even than Auckland.

=== Housing quality ===
Despite the high cost of housing in the capital, the quality of housing in Wellington has been criticised as being poor. 18.4% of houses in Wellington City are sometimes or always mouldy and 24% are sometimes or always damp. Both of these are higher than the New Zealand average.

=== Demographics ===

A Wellington City Council survey conducted in March 2009 found the typical central city apartment dweller was a New Zealand native aged 24 to 35 with a professional job in the downtown area, with household income higher than surrounding areas. Three-quarters (73%) walked to work or university, 13% travelled by car, 6% by bus, 2% bicycled (although 31% own bicycles), and did not travel very far since 73% worked or studied in the central city. The large majority (88%) did not have children in their apartments; 39% were couples without children; 32% were single-person households; 15% were groups of people flatting together. Most (56%) owned their apartment; 42% rented. The report continued: &quot;The four most important reasons for living in an apartment were given as lifestyle and city living (23%), close to work (20%), close to shops and cafes (11%) and low maintenance (11%) ... City noise and noise from neighbours were the main turnoffs for apartment dwellers (27%), followed by a lack of outdoor space (17%), living close to neighbours (9%) and apartment size and a lack of storage space (8%).&quot;

Households are primarily one-family, making up 66.9% of households, followed by single-person households (24.7%); there were fewer multiperson households and even fewer households containing two or more families. These counts are from the 2013 census for the Wellington region (which includes the surrounding area in addition to the four cities).

==Economy==

Wellington Harbour ranks as one of New Zealand&#x27;s chief seaports and serves both domestic and international shipping. The port handles approximately 10.5 million tonnes of cargo on an annual basis, importing petroleum products, motor vehicles, minerals and exporting meats, wood products, dairy products, wool, and fruit. Many cruise ships also use the port.

The Government sector has long been a mainstay of the economy, which has typically risen and fallen with it. Traditionally, its central location meant it was the location of many head offices of various sectors – particularly finance, technology and heavy industry – many of which have since relocated to Auckland following economic deregulation and privatisation.

In recent years, tourism, arts and culture, film, and ICT have played a bigger role in the economy. Wellington&#x27;s median income is well above the average in New Zealand, and the highest of all New Zealand cities. It has a much higher proportion of people with tertiary qualifications than the national average. Major companies with their headquarters in Wellington include:
* Centreport
* Chorus Networks
* Contact Energy
* The Cooperative Bank
* Datacom Group
* Infratil
* Kiwibank
* Meridian Energy
* NZ Post
* NZX
* Todd Corporation
* Trade Me
* Weta Digital
* Wellington International Airport
* Xero
* Z Energy
At the 2013 census, the largest employment industries for Wellington residents were professional, scientific and technical services (25,836 people), public administration and safety (24,336 people), health care and social assistance (17,446 people), education and training (16,550 people) and retail trade (16,203 people). In addition, Wellington is an important centre of the New Zealand film and theatre industry, and second to Auckland in terms of numbers of screen industry businesses.

===Tourism===
Tourism is a major contributor to the city&#x27;s economy, injecting approximately NZ$1.3 billion into the region annually and accounting for 9% of total FTE employment. The city is consistently named as New Zealanders&#x27; favourite destination in the quarterly FlyBuys Colmar Brunton Mood of the Traveller survey and it was ranked fourth in Lonely Planet Best in Travel 2011&#x27;s Top 10 Cities to Visit in 2011. New Zealanders make up the largest visitor market, with 3.6 million visits each year; New Zealand visitors spend on average NZ$2.4 million a day. There are approximately 540,000 international visitors each year, who spend 3.7 million nights and NZ$436 million. The largest international visitor market is Australia, with over 210,000 visitors, spending approximately NZ$334 million annually.
It has been argued that the construction of the Te Papa museum helped transform Wellington into a tourist destination. Wellington is marketed as the &#x27;coolest little capital in the world&#x27; by Positively Wellington Tourism, an award-winning regional tourism organisation set up as a council controlled organisation by Wellington City Council in 1997. The organisation&#x27;s council funding comes through the Downtown Levy commercial rate. In the decade to 2010, the city saw growth of over 60% in commercial guest nights. It has been promoted through a variety of campaigns and taglines, starting with the iconic Absolutely Positively Wellington advertisements. The long-term domestic marketing strategy was a finalist in the 2011 CAANZ Media Awards.

Popular tourist attractions include Wellington Museum, Wellington Zoo, Zealandia and Wellington Cable Car. Cruise tourism is experiencing a major boom in line with nationwide development. The 2010/11 season saw 125,000 passengers and crew visits on 60 liners. There were 80 vessels booked for visits in the 2011/12 season – estimated to inject more than NZ$31 million into the economy and representing a 74% increase in the space of two years.

Wellington is a popular conference tourism destination due to its compact nature, cultural attractions, award-winning restaurants and access to government agencies. In the year ending March 2011, there were 6,495 conference events involving nearly 800,000 delegate days; this injected approximately NZ$100 million into the economy.

==Arts and culture==

=== Culture ===

Owing to the work of Positively Wellington Tourism in marketing it as &quot;the coolest little capital&quot;, the city has been injected into the global zeitgeist as exactly that. It has been traditionally acclaimed as New Zealand&#x27;s &quot;cultural and creative capital&quot;. The city is known for its coffee scene, with now-globally common foods and drinks such as the flat white perfected here. Wellington has a strong coffee culture – the city has more cafés per capita than New York City – and was pioneered by Italian and Greek immigrants to areas such as Mount Victoria, Island Bay and Miramar. Nascent influence is derived from Ethiopian migrants. Wellington&#x27;s cultural vibrance and diversity is well known across the world. It is New Zealand&#x27;s second most ethnically diverse city, bested only by Auckland, and boasts a &quot;melting pot&quot; culture of significant minorities such as Malaysian, Italian, Dutch, Korean, Chinese, Greek, Indian, Samoan and indigenous Taranaki Whānui communities as a result. In particular, Wellington is noted for is contributions to art, cuisine and international filmmaking (with Avatar and The Lord of the Rings being largely produced in the city) among many other factors listed below. The World of Wearable Arts (WOW) is an annual event that brings lots of visitors to Wellington every year.

==== Museums and cultural institutions ====
 Wellington is home to many cultural institutions, including Te Papa (the Museum of New Zealand), the National Library of New Zealand, Archives New Zealand, Wellington Museum (formerly the Wellington Museum of City and Sea), the Katherine Mansfield House and Garden (formerly Katherine Mansfield Birthplace), Colonial Cottage, the Wellington Cable Car Museum, the Reserve Bank Museum, Old St Paul&#x27;s, the National War Memorial Ngā Taonga Sound and Vision, Capital E children&#x27;s playspace and the Wellington City Gallery.

====Festivals====
Wellington is home to many high-profile events and cultural celebrations, including the biennial New Zealand Festival of the Arts, biennial Wellington Jazz Festival, biennial Capital E National Arts Festival for Children and major events such as World of Wearable Art, TEDxWellington, Cuba Street Carnival, Wellington On a Plate, New Zealand Fringe Festival, New Zealand International Comedy Festival, New Zealand Affordable Art Show, Out In The Square, Beervana, and Homegrown Music Festival.

The annual children&#x27;s Artsplash Festival brings together hundreds of students from across the region. The week-long festival includes music and dance performances and the presentation of visual arts. The Performance Arcade is an annual live-art event in shipping containers on the waterfront.

Filmmakers Sir Peter Jackson, Sir Richard Taylor and a growing team of creative professionals have turned the eastern suburb of Miramar into a film-making, post-production and special effects infrastructure centre, giving rise to the moniker &#x27;Wellywood&#x27;. Jackson&#x27;s companies include Wētā Workshop, Wētā FX, Camperdown Studios, post-production house Park Road Post, and Stone Street Studios near Wellington Airport. Films shot partly or wholly in Wellington include the &quot;Lord of The Rings&quot; trilogy, &quot;King Kong&quot; and &quot;Avatar&quot;. Jackson described Wellington: &quot;Well, it&#x27;s windy. But it&#x27;s actually a lovely place, where you&#x27;re pretty much surrounded by water and the bay. The city itself is quite small, but the surrounding areas are very reminiscent of the hills up in northern California, like Marin County near San Francisco and the Bay Area climate and some of the architecture. Kind of a cross between that and Hawaii.&quot;

Sometime Wellington directors Jane Campion and Geoff Murphy have reached the world&#x27;s screens with their independent spirit. Emerging Kiwi filmmakers, like Robert Sarkies, Taika Waititi, Costa Botes and Jennifer Bush-Daumec, are extending the Wellington-based lineage and cinematic scope. There are agencies to assist film-makers with tasks such as securing permits and scouting locations.

Wellington has a large number of independent cinemas, including the Embassy Theatre, Penthouse, the Roxy and Light House, which participate in film festivals throughout the year. Wellington has one of the country&#x27;s highest turn-outs for the annual New Zealand International Film Festival. There are a number of other film festivals hosted in Wellington, such as Doc Edge (documentary), the Japanese Film Festival and Show Me Shorts (short films).

====Music====
The music scene has produced bands such as The Warratahs, The Mockers, The Phoenix Foundation, Shihad, Beastwars, Fly My Pretties, Rhian Sheehan, Birchville Cat Motel, Black Boned Angel, Fat Freddy&#x27;s Drop, The Black Seeds, Fur Patrol, Flight of the Conchords, Connan Mockasin, Rhombus and Module, Weta, Demoniac, and DARTZ. The New Zealand School of Music was established in 2005 through a merger of the conservatory and theory programmes at Massey University and Victoria University of Wellington. New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, Nevine String Quartet and Chamber music New Zealand are based in Wellington. The city is also home to the Rodger Fox Big Band.

====Theatre and dance====
Wellington is home to BATS Theatre, Circa Theatre, the national kaupapa Māori theatre company Taki Rua, the National Theatre for Children at Capital E, the Royal New Zealand Ballet, Gryphon Theatre, and contemporary dance company Footnote.

Venues include St James&#x27; Theatre on Courtenay Place, The Opera House on Manners Street and the Hannah Playhouse.

Te Whaea National Dance &amp; Drama Centre, houses New Zealand&#x27;s university-level schools, Toi Whakaari: New Zealand Drama School &amp; the New Zealand School of Dance, these are separate entities that share the building&#x27;s facilities.

Te Auaha the Whitireia Performing Arts Centre is downtown off Cuba Street.

==== Comedy ====
Many of New Zealand&#x27;s prominent comedians have either come from Wellington or got their start there, such as Ginette McDonald (&quot;Lyn of Tawa&quot;), Raybon Kan, Dai Henwood, Ben Hurley, Steve Wrigley, Guy Williams, the Flight of the Conchords and the satirist John Clarke (&quot;Fred Dagg&quot;).

Wellington is home to groups that perform improvised theatre and improvisational comedy, including Wellington Improvisation Troupe (WIT). The comedy group Breaking the 5th Wall operated out of Wellington and regularly did shows around the city, performing a mix of sketch comedy and semi-improvised theatre. In 2012, the group disbanded when some of its members moved to Australia.

Wellington hosts shows in the annual New Zealand International Comedy Festival.

====Visual arts====
From 1936 to 1992, Wellington was home to the National Art Gallery of New Zealand, when it was amalgamated into Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. Wellington is home to the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts and the Arts Foundation of New Zealand. The city&#x27;s arts centre, Toi Pōneke, is a nexus of creative projects, collaborations, and multi-disciplinary production. Arts Programmes and Services Manager Eric Vaughn Holowacz and a small team based in the Abel Smith Street facility have produced ambitious initiatives such as Opening Notes, Drive by Art, and public art projects. The city is home to the experimental arts publication &quot;White Fungus&quot;. The Learning Connexion provides art classes. Other visual art galleries include the City Gallery.
==Cuisine==
Wellington is characterised by small dining establishments, and its café culture is internationally recognised, being known for its large number of coffeehouses. There are a few iconic cafés that started the obsession with coffee that Wellington has. One of these is the Deluxe Expresso Bar that opened in 1988. Wellington Restaurants offer cuisines including from Europe, Asia and Polynesia; for dishes that have a distinctly New Zealand style, there are lamb, beef, pork and venison, salmon, crayfish (lobster), Bluff oysters, pāua (abalone), mussels, scallops, pipis and tuatua (both New Zealand shellfish); kūmara (sweet potato); kiwifruit and tamarillo; and pavlova, the national dessert.

==Government==

===Local===

Wellington city is administered by the territorial authority of Wellington City Council. The present mayor of the Wellington City Council is Tory Whanau, who was elected in 2022.

Wellington is also part of the wider Wellington Region, administered by the Greater Wellington Region Council. The local authorities are responsible for a wide variety of public services, which include management and maintenance of local roads, and land-use planning.

====Community boards====
The Wellington City Council has created two local community boards under the provisions of Part 4 of the Local Government Act 2002 for certain parts of the city:

*The Tawa Community Board representing the northern suburbs of Tawa, Grenada North and Takapū Valley; and
*The Mākara/Ōhāriu Community Board representing the rural suburbs of Ohariu, Mākara and Mākara Beach.
===National===
Wellington is covered by four general electorates: Mana, Ōhāriu, Rongotai, and Wellington Central. It is also covered by two Māori electorates: Te Tai Hauāuru, and Te Tai Tonga. Each electorate returns one member to the New Zealand House of Representatives. Two general electorates are held by the Labour Party and two are held by the Green Party and the two Maori electorates are held by Te Pāti Māori.

In addition, there are a number of Wellington-based list MPs, who are elected via party lists.

Due to Wellington being the capital city of New Zealand, its residents are more likely to participate in politics compared to other cities in New Zealand.

==Education==

Wellington offers a variety of college and university programs for tertiary students:
Victoria University of Wellington has four campuses and works with a three-trimester system (beginning March, July, and November). It enrolled 21,380 students in 2008; of these, 16,609 were full-time students. Of all students, 56% were female and 44% male. While the student body was primarily New Zealanders of European descent, 1,713 were Māori, 1,024 were Pacific students, 2,765 were international students. 5,751 degrees, diplomas and certificates were awarded. The university has 1,930 full-time employees.

Massey University has a Wellington campus known as the &quot;creative campus&quot; and offers courses in communication and business, engineering and technology, health and well-being, and creative arts. Its school of design was established in 1886 and has research centres for studying public health, sleep, Māori health, small &amp; medium enterprises, disasters, and tertiary teaching excellence. It combined with Victoria University to create the New Zealand School of Music.

The University of Otago has a Wellington branch, with its Wellington School of Medicine and Health.

Whitireia New Zealand has large campuses in Porirua, Wellington and Kapiti; the Wellington Institute of Technology and New Zealand&#x27;s National Drama school, Toi Whakaari. The Wellington area has numerous primary and secondary schools.

==Transport==
Wellington is served by State Highway 1 in the west and State Highway 2 in the east, meeting at the Ngauranga Interchange north of the city centre, where SH 1 runs through the city to the airport. There are two other state highways in the wider region: State Highway 58 which provides a direct connection between the Hutt Valley and Porirua, and State Highway 59 which follows a coastal route between Linden and Mackays Crossing and was previously part of SH 1. Road access into the capital is constrained by the mountainous terrain – between Wellington and the Kāpiti Coast, SH 1 passes through the steep and narrow Wainui Saddle, nearby SH 59 travels along the Centennial Highway, a narrow section of road between the Paekākāriki Escarpment and the Tasman Sea, and between Wellington and Wairarapa SH 2 transverses the Rimutaka Ranges on a similar narrow winding road. Wellington has two motorways: the Johnsonville–Porirua Motorway (largely part of SH 1, with the northernmost section part of SH 59) and the Wellington Urban Motorway (entirely part of SH 1), which in combination with a small non-motorway section in the Ngauranga Gorge connect Porirua with Wellington city. A third motorway in the wider region, the Transmission Gully Motorway forming part of the SH 1 route and officially opened on 30 March 2022, leaves the Johnsonville-Porirua Motorway at the boundary between Wellington and Porirua and provides the main route between Wellington and the wider North Island.

Bus transport in Wellington is supplied by several different operators under the banner of Metlink. Buses serve almost every part of Wellington city, with most of them running along the &quot;Golden Mile&quot; from Wellington railway station to Courtenay Place. Until October 2017, there were nine trolleybus routes, all other buses running on diesel. The trolleybus network was the last public system of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere.

Wellington lies at the southern end of the North Island Main Trunk railway (NIMT) and the Wairarapa Line, converging on Wellington railway station at the northern end of central Wellington. Two long-distance services leave from Wellington: the Capital Connection, for commuters from Palmerston North, and the Northern Explorer to Auckland.

Four electrified suburban lines radiate from Wellington railway station to the outer suburbs to the north of Wellington – the Johnsonville Line through the hillside suburbs north of central Wellington; the Kapiti Line along the NIMT to Waikanae on the Kāpiti Coast via Porirua and Paraparaumu; the Melling Line to Lower Hutt via Petone; and the Hutt Valley Line along the Wairarapa Line via Waterloo and Taitā to Upper Hutt. A diesel-hauled carriage service, the Wairarapa Connection, connects several times daily to Masterton in the Wairarapa via the Rimutaka Tunnel. Combined, these five services carry 11.64 million passengers per year.
CentrePort Wellington is the operator of the port of Wellington, and provides infrastructure for shipping and cargo, including the commercial wharves in Wellington Harbour. It also provides port services for the Cook Strait ferries to Picton in the South Island, operated by state-owned Interislander and private Bluebridge. Local ferries connect Wellington city centre with Eastbourne and Seatoun.

Wellington International Airport is south-east of the city centre. It is serviced by flights from across New Zealand, Australia, Singapore (via Melbourne), and Fiji. Flights to other international destinations require a transfer at another airport, as aircraft range is limited by Wellington&#x27;s short () runway, which has become an issue in recent years regarding the Wellington region&#x27;s economic performance.

==Infrastructure==
===Electric power===
Wellington&#x27;s first public electricity supply was established in 1904, alongside the introduction of electric trams, and was originally supplied at 105 volts 80 hertz. The conversion to the now-standard 230/400 volts 50 hertz began in 1925, the same year the city was connected to the Mangahao hydroelectric scheme. Between 1924 and 1968, the city&#x27;s supply was supplemented by a coal-fired power station at Evans Bay.

Today, Wellington city is supplied from four Transpower substations: Takapu Road, Kaiwharawhara, Wilton, and Central Park (Mount Cook). Wellington Electricity owns and operates the local distribution network.

The city is home to two large wind farms, West Wind and Mill Creek, which combined contribute up to 213 MW of electricity to the city and the national grid.

While Wellington experiences regular strong winds, and only 63% of Wellington Electricity&#x27;s network is underground, the city has a very reliable power supply. In the year to March 2018, Wellington Electricity disclosed the average customer spent just 55 minutes without power due to unplanned outages.

===Natural gas===
Wellington was one of the original nine towns and cities in New Zealand to be supplied with natural gas when the Kapuni gas field entered production in 1970, and a high-pressure pipeline from the field in Taranaki to the city was completed. The high-pressure transmission pipelines supplying Wellington are now owned and operated by First Gas, with Powerco owning and operating the medium- and low-pressure distribution pipelines within the urban area.

=== The three waters ===
The &quot;three waters&quot; – drinking water, stormwater, and wastewater services for the Wellington metropolitan area are provided by five councils: Wellington City, Hutt, Upper Hutt and Porirua city councils, and the Greater Wellington Regional Council. However, the water assets of these councils are managed by an infrastructure asset management company, Wellington Water.

Wellington&#x27;s first piped water supply came from a spring in 1867. Greater Wellington Regional Council now supplies Lower Hutt, Porirua, Upper Hutt and Wellington with up to 220 million litres a day. The water comes from Wainuiomata River (since 1884), Hutt River (1914), Ōrongorongo River (1926) and the Waiwhetū Aquifer.

There are four wastewater treatment stations serving the Wellington metropolitan area, located at:
* Moa Point (serving Wellington city)
* Seaview (serving Lower Hutt and Upper Hutt)
* Karori (serving the suburb)
* Porirua (serving northern Wellington suburbs, Tawa and Porirua city)
The Wellington metropolitan area faces challenges with ageing infrastructure for the three waters, and there have been some significant failures, particularly in wastewater systems. The water supply is vulnerable to severe disruption during a major earthquake, although a wide range of projects are planned to improve the resilience of the water supply and allow a limited water supply post-earthquake.

In May 2021, the Wellington City Council approved a 10-year plan that included expenditure of $2.7billion on water pipe maintenance and upgrades in Wellington city, and an additional $147 to $208 million for plant upgrades at the Moa Point wastewater treatment plant. In November 2023, Wellington Water noted that on-going investment of $1 billion per annum was required to address water issues across the Greater Wellington region, but that this amount was beyond the funding capacity of councils.

== Media ==
=== Newspapers ===
For many years Wellington had two daily newspapers – &quot;The Evening Post&quot; in the afternoon and &quot;The Dominion&quot; in the morning. &quot;The Evening Post&quot; was founded in 1865 by Dublin-born printer, newspaper manager and leader-writer Henry Blundell, while &quot;The Dominion&quot; was first published on 26 September 1907, the day New Zealand achieved Dominion status. The two newspapers merged in 2002 to form &quot;The Dominion Post&quot; and in April 2023 the merged newspaper was renamed &quot;The Post&quot;.

=== Radio ===
Wellington is served by 26 full-power radio stations: 17 on FM, four on AM, and five on both FM and AM.

=== Television ===
Television broadcasts began in Wellington on 1 July 1961 with the launch of channel WNTV1, becoming the third New Zealand city (after Auckland and Christchurch) to receive regular television broadcasts. WNTV1&#x27;s main studios were in Waring Taylor Street in central Wellington and broadcast from a transmitter atop Mount Victoria. In 1967, the Mount Victoria transmitter was replaced with a more powerful transmitter at Mount Kaukau. In November 1969, WNTV1 was networked with its counterpart stations in Auckland, Christchurch and Dunedin to form NZBC TV.

In 1975, the NZBC was broken up, with Wellington and Dunedin studios taking over NZBC TV as Television One while Auckland and Christchurch studios launched Television Two. At the same time, the Wellington studios moved to the new purpose-built Avalon Television Centre in Lower Hutt. In 1980, Televisions One and Two merged under a single company, Television New Zealand (TVNZ). The majority of television production moved to Auckland over the 1980s, culminating in the opening of TVNZ&#x27;s new Auckland television centre in 1989.

Today, digital terrestrial television (Freeview) is available in the city, transmitting from Mount Kaukau plus three infill transmitters at Baxters Knob, Fitzherbert, and Haywards.

== Sister cities ==
Wellington has sister city relationships with the following cities:

*Sydney, Australia (1983)
*Xiamen, China (1987)
*Sakai, Japan (1994)
*Beijing, China (2006)
*Canberra, Australia (2016)

Wellington is also a &quot;friendly city&quot; with Ramallah, Palestine, and a 2023 council vote means both are expected to be sister cities in the future. Wellington also has historical ties with Chania, Greece; Harrogate, England; and Çanakkale, Turkey.

==Wellington metropolitan area==
The wider metropolitan area for Wellington encompasses areas administered by four local authorities: Wellington City itself, on the peninsula between Cook Strait and Wellington Harbour; Porirua City on Porirua Harbour to the north, notable for its large Māori and Pasifika communities; and Lower Hutt City and Upper Hutt City, largely suburban areas to the northeast, together known as the Hutt Valley. Depending on the source, the Wellington metro area may include Waikanae, Paraparaumu and Paekākāriki on the Kāpiti Coast, and/or Featherston and Greytown in the Wairarapa.

The urban areas of the four local authorities have a combined population of residents as of .

The four cities comprising the Wellington metropolitan area have a total population of with the urban area containing % of that population. The remaining areas are largely mountainous and sparsely farmed or parkland and are outside the urban area boundary. More than most cities, life is dominated by its central business district (CBD). Approximately 62,000 people work in the CBD, only 4,000 fewer than work in Auckland&#x27;s CBD, despite that city having four times the population.

The Waikanae-Paraparaumu-Paekākāriki combined urban area in the Kāpiti Coast district is sometimes included in the Wellington metro area due to its exurban nature and strong transport links with Wellington. If included as part of the Wellington metro, Waikanae-Paraparaumu-Paekākāriki would add to the population (as of ).

Featherston and Greytown in the Wairarapa are rarely considered part of the Wellington metropolitan area, being physically separated from the rest of the metropolitan area by the Remutaka Range. However, both have significant proportions of their employed population working in Wellington city and the Hutt Valley (36.1% and 17.1% in 2006 respectively) and are considered part of the Wellington functional urban area by Statistics New Zealand.

The four urban areas combined had a usual resident population of 401,850 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 26,307 people (7.0%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 42,726 people (11.9%) since the 2006 census. There were 196,911 males and 204,936 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.961 males per female. Of the total population, 74,892 people (18.6%) were aged up to 15 years, 93,966 (23.4%) were 15 to 29, 185,052 (46.1%) were 30 to 64, and 47,952 (11.9%) were 65 or older.

<text>Wookey Hole Caves () are a series of limestone caverns, a show cave and tourist attraction in the village of Wookey Hole on the southern edge of the Mendip Hills near Wells in Somerset, England. The River Axe flows through the cave. It is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for both biological and geological reasons. Wookey Hole cave is a &quot;solutional cave&quot;, one that is formed by a process of weathering in which the natural acid in groundwater dissolves the rocks. Some water originates as rain that flows into streams on impervious rocks on the plateau before sinking at the limestone boundary into cave systems such as Swildon&#x27;s Hole, Eastwater Cavern and St Cuthbert&#x27;s Swallet; the rest is rain that percolates directly through the limestone. The temperature in the caves is a constant .

The caves have been used by humans for around 45,000 years, demonstrated by the discovery of tools from the Palaeolithic period, along with fossilised animal remains. Evidence of Stone and Iron Age occupation continued into Roman Britain. A corn-grinding mill operated on the resurgent waters of the River Axe as early as the Domesday survey of 1086. The waters of the river are used in a handmade paper mill, the oldest extant in Britain, which began operations circa 1610. The low, constant temperature of the caves means that they can be used for maturing Cheddar cheese.

The caves were the site of the first cave dives in Britain, undertaken by Jack Sheppard, Graham Balcombe and Penelope Powell in the 1930s. Since then, divers have explored the extensive network of chambers developing breathing apparatus and novel techniques in the process. The full extent of the cave system is still unknown with approximately , including 25 chambers, having been explored. Part of the cave system opened as a show cave in 1927 following exploratory work by Herbert E. Balch. As a tourist attraction it has been owned by Madame Tussauds and, most recently, the circus owner Gerry Cottle. The cave is notable for the Witch of Wookey Hole, a roughly human-shaped stalagmite that legend says is a witch turned to stone by a monk from Glastonbury. It has also been used as a location for film and television productions, including the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Revenge of the Cybermen&quot;.

==Description==
The show cave consists of a dry gallery connecting three large chambers, the first of which contains the Witch of Wookey formation. There are various high-level passages leading off from these chambers, with two small exits above the tourist entrance. The River Axe is formed by the water entering the cave systems and flows through the third and first chambers, from which it flows to the resurgence, through two sumps long, where it leaves the cave and enters the open air.

The river is maintained at an artificially high level and falls a couple of metres when a sluice is lowered to allow access to the fourth and fifth chambers, two small air spaces. Normally, however, these are only accessible by cave diving. Beyond the fifth chamber a roomy submerged route may be followed for a further , passing under three large rifts with air spaces, to surface in the ninth chamber – a roomy chamber over long and the same high. High-level passages here lead to a former resurgence, now blocked, some above the current resurgence.

An artificial tunnel leading off from the third chamber allows show cave visitors to cross the seventh and eighth chambers on bridges, and skirt around the ninth chamber on a walkway, before exiting near the resurgence. A second excavated tunnel from the ninth chamber allows visitors to visit the 20th chamber.

From the ninth chamber, a dive of about passes almost immediately from the Dolomitic Conglomerate into the limestone, and descends steadily for to a depth of under a couple of high rifts with airbells (enclosed air spaces between water and roof) before reaching air space in the 19th chamber. The 20th chamber is at the top of a large boulder slope – long, wide, and high. From here a roomy passage some long ascends towards a now-blocked fossil resurgence in the Ebbor Gorge. The total length of passages in this area is about . A passage near the end connects with Chamber 24 near Sting Corner.

The continuation is found in the 19th chamber, where of passage descending to a depth of surfaces in the 22nd chamber – of dry passages at various levels with a static pool. The way on is within this pool at a depth of where of passage ascends to surface in the 23rd chamber – of large passage, followed by four short sumps that arrive in the 24th chamber. This is of what is described in the guidebook as &quot;magnificent&quot; river passage, high and wide, which finishes at a cascade falling from a long lake. There are also more than of high-level passages above the river. The way on continues underwater for some reaching a depth of before surfacing in the 25th chamber – called the Lake of Gloom because of its thick mud deposits. The sump at the end of this has been dived for to a maximum depth of before gravel chokes prevented further progress. The end is about northeast of the entrance.

==Hydrology and geology==
Wookey Hole is on the southern escarpment of the Mendip Hills, and is the resurgence that drains the southern flanks of North Hill and Pen Hill. It is the second-largest resurgence on Mendip, with an estimated catchment area of , and an average discharge of per second. Some of the water is allogenic in origin i.e. drained off non-limestone rocks, collecting as streams on the surface before sinking at or near the Lower Limestone Shale — Black Rock Limestone boundary, often through swallets such as Plantation Swallet near St Cuthbert&#x27;s lead works between the Hunter&#x27;s Lodge Inn and Priddy Pools. It then passes through major cave systems such as Swildon&#x27;s Hole, Eastwater Cavern and St Cuthbert&#x27;s Swallet, around Priddy, but 95% is autogenic water that has percolated directly into the limestone.

The southern slopes of the Mendip Hills largely follow the flanks of an anticline, a fold in the rock that is convex upwards and has its oldest beds at its core. On the Mendips the crest of the anticline is truncated by erosion, forming a plateau. The rock strata here dip 10–15 degrees to the southwest. The outer slopes are mainly of Carboniferous Limestone, with Devonian age Old Red Sandstone exposed as an inlier at the centre. Wookey Hole is a solutional cave, mainly formed in the limestone by chemical weathering whereby naturally acidic groundwater dissolves the carbonate rocks, but it is unique in that the first part of the cave is formed in Triassic Dolomitic Conglomerate, a well-cemented fossil limestone scree representing the infill of a Triassic valley.

The cave was formed under phreatic conditions i.e. below the local water table, but lowering base levels to which the subterranean drainage was flowing resulted in some passages being abandoned by the river, and there is evidence of a number of abandoned resurgences. In particular, the passages in the 20th chamber are interpreted as a former Vauclusian spring, the waters of which once surfaced in the Ebbor Gorge. It is uncertain whether that was the original rising or whether it formed when the main rising at Wookey was blocked.

The current resurgence is located close to the base of the Dolomitic Conglomerate at the head of a short gorge formed by headward erosion with subsequent cavern collapse. The morphology of the passages is determined by the rock strata in which they are formed. The streamway in the outer part of the cave system that is formed within the Dolomitic Conglomerate is characterised by shallow loops linking low bedding chambers, or tall narrow passages, known as &#x27;rifts&#x27;, developed by phreatic solutional enlargement of fractured rifts. The streamway in the inner part of the system formed within the limestone is characterised by deep phreatic loops reaching depths as much as , with the water flowing down-dip along bedding planes and rising up enlarged joints. In the far reaches of the cave the passages descend to below sea level.

==History==
Witcombe suggests that the name &quot;Wookey&quot; is derived from the Celtic (Welsh) for &#x27;cave&#x27;, &quot;ogo&quot; or &quot;ogof&quot;, which gave the early names for this cave of &quot;Ochie&quot; or &quot;Ochy&quot;. &quot;Hole&quot; is Anglo-Saxon for cave, which is itself of Latin/Norman derivation. Therefore, the name &quot;Wookey Hole Cave&quot; basically means &quot;cave cave cave&quot;. Eilert Ekwall gives an alternative derivation of &quot;Wookey&quot; from the Old English &quot;wocig&quot;, meaning a noose or snare for animals. By the 18th century the caves were commonly known as &quot;Okey Hole&quot;. It was known as such when it was first described in print in 1681 by the geologist John Beaumont.

Fossils of a range of animals have been found including the Pleistocene lion (&quot;Felis leo spelæ&quot;), cave hyena (&quot;Crocuta crocuta spelaea&quot;) and badger (&quot;Meles meles&quot;). Wookey Hole was occupied by humans in the Iron Age, possibly around 250–300 BC, while nearby Hyena Cave was occupied by Stone Age hunters. Badger Hole and Rhinoceros Hole are two dry caves on the slopes above the Wookey ravine near the Wookey Hole resurgence and contain in situ cave sediments laid down during the Ice Age. Just outside the cave the foundations of a 1st-century hut have been identified. These had been built on during the Roman era up to the end of the 4th century.

In 1544 products of Roman lead working in the area were discovered. The lead mines across the Mendips have produced contamination of the water emerging from the caverns at Wookey Hole. The lead in the water is believed to have affected the quality of the paper produced.

The designation of the water catchment area for Wookey Hole, covering a large area of the Mendip Hills as far away as Priddy Pools, as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) during the 1970s and 1980s was controversial because of conflicts of interest between land owners, recreational cavers and cave scientists. Initial proposals put forward by the Council of Southern Caving Clubs (part of the British Caving Association) were that SSSI designation, which would restrict what farmers and other landowners were allowed to do, would cover the entire catchment area. This was opposed as being too restrictive and difficult to enforce. It was argued that agricultural use of fields not directly in contact with cave entrances would have little detrimental effect on the caves themselves. There was also debate about which caves and cave features should be considered &quot;important&quot;. The final settlement resulted in a smaller area being designated and many agricultural practices being removed from the list of proscribed &quot;Potentially Damaging Operations&quot;.

The entrance weir and sluice gate servicing the paper mill was built about 1852. The tunnel excavated from the third chamber to the ninth chamber and then out to daylight was dug in 1974–1975 by ex-coal miners from the Radstock area. The show cave was further extended in 2015 by excavating a tunnel from the ninth chamber to the 20th chamber.

The constant temperature of in the caves is used by Ford Farm of Dorset to mature Cheddar cheese in the &#x27;Cheese Tunnel&#x27; – an excavated side tunnel between the ninth chamber and the exit to the show cave.

===Cave archaeology===
Archaeological investigations were undertaken from 1859 to 1874 by William Boyd Dawkins, who moved to Somerset to study classics with the vicar of Wookey. On hearing of the discovery of bones by local workmen, he led excavations in the area of the hyena den. His work led to the discovery of the first evidence for the use by Paleolithic humans in the caves of the Mendip Hills. Middle Paleolithic tools have been found in association with butchered bones with a radiocarbon age of around 41,000 years.

Herbert E. Balch continued the work from 1904 to 1914, when he led excavations of the entrance passage (1904–1915), Witch&#x27;s Kitchen (the first chamber) and Hell&#x27;s Ladder (1926–1927) and the Badger Hole (1938–1954), where Roman coins from the 3rd century were discovered along with Aurignacian flint implements. Rhinoceros Hole was scheduled as an ancient monument in 1992. The 1911 work found of stratification, mostly dating from the Iron Age and sealed into place by Romano-British artefacts. Finds included a silver coin of Marcia (124 BC), pottery, weapons and tools, bronze ornaments, and Roman coins from Vespasian to Valentinian II (1st to 4th centuries).

The work was continued, first by E. J. Mason from 1946 to 1949, and then by G. R. Morgan in 1972. Later work led by Edgar Kingsley Tratman explored the human occupation of Rhinoceros Hole, and showed that the fourth chamber of the great cave was a Romano-British cemetery. During excavations in 1954–1957 at Hole Ground, just outside the entrance to the cave, the foundations of a 1st-century hut and Iron Age pottery were seen. These were covered by the foundations of Roman buildings, dating from the 1st to the late 4th century.

===Exploration===
The cave as far as the third chamber and side galleries has been known since at least the Iron Age period. Before the construction of a dam at the resurgence to feed water to the paper mill downstream, two more chambers (the Fourth and Fifth) were accessible. Further upstream the way lies underwater. Diving was first tried by the Cave Diving Group under the leadership of Graham Balcombe in 1935. With equipment on loan from Siebe Gorman, he and Penelope (&quot;Mossy&quot;) Powell penetrated into the cave, reaching the seventh chamber, using standard diving dress. The events marked the first successful cave dives in Britain.

Diving at Wookey resumed in early June 1946 when Balcombe used his homemade respirator and waterproof suit to explore the region between the resurgence and first chamber, as well as the underground course of the river between the third and first chambers. During these dives, the Romano-British remains were found and archaeological work dominated the early dives in the cave. The large ninth chamber was first entered on 24 April 1948 by Balcombe and Don Coase. Using this as an advance dive base, the 10th and then 11th chambers were discovered. The way on, however, was too deep for divers breathing pure oxygen from a closed-circuit rebreather. The cave claimed its first life on 9 April 1949 when Gordon Marriott lost his life returning from the ninth chamber. Another fatality occurred in 1981 when Keith Potter was drowned on a routine dive further upstream.

Further progress required apparatus that could overcome the depth limitation of breathing pure oxygen. In 1955, using an aqualung and swimming with fins, Bob Davies reached the bottom of the 11th chamber at depth in clear water and discovered the 12th and 13th chambers. He got separated from his guideline and the other two divers in the 11th chamber, ending up spending three hours trapped in the 13th chamber, and had much trouble getting back to safety. Opinion hardened against the use of the short-duration aqualung in favour of longer-duration closed-circuit equipment. Likewise, the traditional approach of walking along the bottom was preferred over swimming. Employing semi-closed circuit nitrogen-oxygen rebreathers, between 1957 and 1960 John Buxton and Oliver Wells went on to reach the elbow of the sump upstream from the ninth chamber at a depth of . This was at a point known as &quot;The Slot&quot;, the way on being too deep for the gas mixture they were breathing.

A six-year hiatus ensued while open circuit air diving became established, along with free-swimming and the use of neoprene wetsuits. The new generation of cave diver was now more mobile above and under water and able to dive deeper. Using this approach, Dave Savage was able to reach air surface in the 18th chamber (chambers did not have to have air spaces to be so named; they were the limits of each exploration) in May 1966. A brief lull in exploration occurred while the mess of guidelines laid from the ninth chamber was sorted out before John Parker progressed first to the large, dry, inlet passage of the 20th chamber, and thence followed the River Axe upstream on a dive covering at a maximum depth of to the 22nd chamber where the way on appeared to be lost.

Meanwhile, climbing operations in the ninth chamber found an abandoned outlet passage that terminated very close to the surface, as well as a dry overland route downstream through the higher levels of the eighth, seventh and sixth chambers as far as the fifth chamber. These discoveries were used to enable the show cave to be extended into the ninth chamber and the cave divers to start directly from here, bypassing the dive from the third chamber onwards. The way on from the 22nd chamber was at last found by Colin Edmond and Martyn Farr in February 1976 and was explored until the line ran out. A few days later Geoff Yeadon and Oliver Statham somewhat controversially reached the 23rd chamber after laying just a further of line. After a further three short dives they surfaced in the 24th chamber to be confronted by what Statham described as &quot;a magnificent sight—the whole of the River Axe pouring down a passage high by wide&quot; terminating in a blue lake after . This lake was dived by Farr a few days later for at a maximum depth of to emerge in the 25th chamber, a desolate, muddy place named &quot;The Lake of Gloom&quot;.

The 25th chamber represents the furthest upstream air surface in Wookey Hole Cave. From here the River Axe rises up from a deep sump where progressive depth records for cave diving in the British Isles have been set: firstly by Farr () in 1977, then Rob Parker () in 1985, and finally by John Volanthen and Rick Stanton () in 2004. The pair returned again in 2005 to explore the sump to a depth of , setting a new British Isles depth record for cave diving. This record was broken in 2008 by Polish explorer Artur Kozłowski, then later again by Michal Marek, on dives in Pollatoomary in Ireland.
Taking advantage of the tunnel driven through to Chamber 20 by the show cave management in 2015, a team began seriously to investigate the leads in that area. One small passage was pushed to a sump that was dived through to Sting Corner in Chamber 24. In 2020 a dry connection was made to the same location.

During 1996–1997 water samples were collected at various points throughout the caves and showed different chemical compositions. Results showed that the &quot;Unknown Junction&quot;, from where water flows to the static sump in the 22nd chamber by a different route from the majority of the River Axe, is upstream of the sump in the 25th.

==Witch of Wookey Hole==
There are old legends of a &quot;witch of Wookey Hole&quot;, which are still preserved in the name of a stalagmite in the first chamber of the caves. The story has several different versions with the same basic features:

A man from Glastonbury is engaged to a young woman from Wookey. A witch living in Wookey Hole Caves curses the romance so that it fails. The man, now a monk, seeks revenge on this witch who—having been jilted herself—frequently spoils budding relationships. The monk stalks the witch into the cave and she hides in a dark corner near one of the underground rivers. The monk blesses the water and splashes some of it at the dark parts of the cave where the witch was hiding. The blessed water immediately petrifies the witch, and she remains in the cave to this day.

A 1000-year-old skeleton was discovered in the caves by Balch in 1912, and has also traditionally been linked to the legendary witch, although analysis indicated that they are the remains of a male aged between 25 and 35. The remains have been part of the collection of the Wells and Mendip Museum, founded by Balch, since they were excavated, though in 2004 the owner of the caves said that he wanted them to be returned to Wookey Hole.

It was partly the legend of the witch that prompted TV&#x27;s &quot;Most Haunted&quot; team to visit Wookey Hole Caves and Mill to explore the location in depth, searching for evidence of paranormal activity. The show, which aired on 10 March 2009, was the last episode transmitted in series 11 of the show&#x27;s run on the satellite and cable TV channel Living. In 2009, a new actress to play the &#x27;witch&#x27; was chosen by Wookey Hole Ltd amid much media interest. Carole Bohanan in the role of Carla Calamity was selected from over 3,000 applicants.
==Tourism==
The cave was first opened to the public by the owner Captain G.W. Hodgkinson in 1927 following preparatory work by Balch. Three years later, John Cowper Powys wrote of the caves in the novel &quot;A Glastonbury Romance&quot;. Hodgkinson took offence at the portrayal of his fictional equivalent, initiating a costly libel suit.

The current paper mill building, whose water wheel is powered by a small canal from the river, dates from around 1860 and is a Grade II listed building. The commercial production of handmade paper ceased in February 2008 after owner Gerry Cottle concluded there was no longer a market for the product, and therefore sold most of the historic machinery. Visitors to the site are still able to watch a short video of the paper being made from cotton. Other attractions include the dinosaur valley, a small museum about the cave and cave diving, a theatre with circus shows, a house of mirrors and penny arcades.

In 1956, Olive Hodgkinson, a cave guide whose husband&#x27;s family owned the caves for over 500 years, was a contestant on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;

In the late 1950s, the caves were photographed by Stanley Long of VistaScreen, to be sold as both souvenirs and as mail-order stereoviews.

The cave and mill were joined, after purchase, by Madame Tussauds in 1973 and operated together as a tourist attraction until there was a management team buyout in 1989. A collection of fairground art of Wookey Hole was sold in 1997 at Christie&#x27;s. The present owner is the former circus proprietor Gerry Cottle, who has introduced a circus school.

The cave was used for the filming of episodes of the BBC TV series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;: the serial &quot;Revenge of the Cybermen&quot; (1975) starring Tom Baker. This has since been referenced in the comedy of &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot;. The cave was also used in the filming of the British series &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; (1978) and &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; (1983). The caves were used again for &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in &quot;The End of Time&quot; (2009), including a scene with the Doctor sharing thoughts and visions with the Ood.

In 2005, the museum reported that a Dalek prop had gone missing from its collection, and that they had received a ransom note and a detached plunger from the &quot;Guardians of the Planet Earth&quot;. The prop was later recovered from Glastonbury Tor after thieves had supposedly considered it &quot;too hot&quot;. Cottle denied that this was a publicity stunt.

On 1 August 2006, CNN reported that Barney, a Doberman Pinscher employed as a security dog at Wookey Hole, had destroyed parts of a valuable collection of teddy bears, including one which had belonged to Elvis Presley, which was estimated to be worth £40,000 (US$75,000). The insurance company insuring the exhibition of stuffed animals had supposedly insisted on having guard dog protection. Cottle later admitted that he had invented this story as a publicity stunt, and no such bear had ever been owned by the museum.

In February 2009 Cottle turned the Victorian bowling green next to the caves into a crazy golf course without first obtaining planning permission.

<text>Walter Adolph Georg Gropius (18 May 1883 – 5 July 1969) was a German-born American architect and founder of the Bauhaus School, who is widely regarded as one of the pioneering masters of modernist architecture. He was a founder of Bauhaus in Weimar and taught there for several years, becoming known as a leading proponent of the International Style. Gropius emigrated from Germany to England in 1934 and from England to the United States in 1937, where he spent much of the rest of his life teaching at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. In the United States he worked on several projects with Marcel Breuer and with the firm The Architects Collaborative, of which he was a founding partner. In 1959, he won the AIA Gold Medal, one of the most prestigious awards in architecture. 

==Early life and family==
Born in Berlin, Walter Gropius was the third child of Walter Adolph Gropius and Manon Auguste Pauline Scharnweber (1855–1933), daughter of the Prussian politician (1816–1894). Walter&#x27;s great-uncle Martin Gropius (1824–1880) was the architect of the Kunstgewerbemuseum in Berlin and a follower of Karl Friedrich Schinkel, with whom Walter&#x27;s great-grandfather Carl Gropius, who fought under Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher at the Battle of Waterloo, had shared a flat as a bachelor.
 

In 1915, Gropius married Alma Mahler (1879–1964), widow of Gustav Mahler. Walter and Alma&#x27;s daughter, named Manon after Walter&#x27;s mother, was born in 1916. When Manon died of polio at age 18, in 1935, composer Alban Berg wrote his Violin Concerto in memory of her (it is inscribed &quot;to the memory of an angel&quot;). Gropius and Mahler divorced in 1920 (She had by that time established a relationship with Franz Werfel, whom she later married).

Gropius married Ilse Frank, known as Ise, on 16 October 1923; they remained together until his death in 1969. The couple adopted Beate Frank known as Ati, the orphaned daughter of Ise&#x27;s sister Hertha. Ise Gropius died on 9 June 1983 in Lexington, Massachusetts.

Walter&#x27;s sister Manon Burchard (1880–1975) is the great-grandmother of the German film and theater actresses Marie Burchard and , and of the curator and art historian Wolf Burchard.

== Career ==
=== Early career (1908–1914) ===
In 1908, after studying architecture in Munich and Berlin for four semesters, Gropius joined the office of the architect and industrial designer Peter Behrens, one of the first members of the utilitarian school. His fellow employees at this time included Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier, and Dietrich Marcks.

Gropius left the firm of Behrens in 1910 and established a practice in Berlin with fellow employee Adolf Meyer. Together they share credit for one of the pioneering modernist buildings created during this period: the Faguswerk in Alfeld-an-der-Leine, Germany, a shoe last factory. Although Gropius and Meyer only designed the facade, the glass curtain walls of this building demonstrated both the modernist principle that form reflects function and Gropius&#x27;s concern with providing healthful conditions for the working class.

The factory is now regarded as one of the crucial founding monuments of European modernism. Gropius was commissioned in 1913 to design a car for the Prussian Railroad Locomotive Works in Königsberg. This locomotive was unique and the first of its kind in Germany and perhaps in Europe.

Other works of this early period include the office and factory building for the Werkbund Exhibition (1914) in Cologne.

Gropius published an article about &quot;The Development of Industrial Buildings&quot; in 1913, which included about a dozen photographs of factories and grain elevators in North America. A very influential text, this article had a strong influence on other European modernists, including Le Corbusier and Erich Mendelsohn, both of whom reprinted Gropius&#x27;s grain elevator pictures between 1920 and 1930.

Gropius&#x27;s career was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I in 1914. He was drafted in August 1914 and served as a sergeant major at the Western front during the war years (getting wounded and almost killed) and then as a lieutenant in the signal corps. Gropius was awarded the Iron Cross twice&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.architectural-review.com&quot;&gt;Paul Davies (30 April 2013), &quot;Walter Gropius&quot;. &quot;Architectural Review&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; (&quot;when it still meant something,&quot; he confided to his friend Chester Nagel) after fighting for four years. Gropius then, like his father and his great-uncle Martin Gropius before him, became an architect.

=== Bauhaus period (1919–1932) ===
Gropius&#x27;s career advanced in the postwar period. Henry van de Velde, the master of the Grand-Ducal Saxon School of Arts and Crafts in Weimar was asked to step down in 1915 due to his Belgian nationality. His recommendation for Gropius to succeed him led eventually to Gropius&#x27;s appointment as master of the school in 1919. It was this academy which Gropius transformed into the world-famous Bauhaus (a.k.a. Gropius School of Arts), attracting a faculty that included Paul Klee, Johannes Itten, Josef Albers, Herbert Bayer, László Moholy-Nagy, Otto Bartning and Wassily Kandinsky.

In principle, the Bauhaus represented an opportunity to extend beauty and quality to every home through well designed industrially produced objects. The Bauhaus program was experimental and the emphasis was theoretical. One example product of the Bauhaus was the armchair F 51, designed for the Bauhaus&#x27;s directors room in 1920 – nowadays a re-edition in the market, manufactured by the German company TECTA/Lauenfoerde.

In 1919, Gropius was involved in the Glass Chain utopian expressionist correspondence under the pseudonym &quot;Mass.&quot; Usually more notable for his functionalist approach, the &quot;Monument to the March Dead&quot;, designed in 1919 and executed in 1920, indicates that expressionism was an influence on him at that time. In 1920, the Bauhaus was given its first major commission that would utilize almost all of the workshops in the school. This commission was for a house for Adolf Sommerfeld made from wood. The architectural designs for the house came from Gropius and Adolf Meyer. The Sommerfeld House was completed in 1921.

In 1923, Gropius designed his famous door handles, now considered an icon of 20th-century design and often listed as one of the most influential designs to emerge from Bauhaus. Facing political and financial difficulties in Weimar, Gropius and the Bauhaus moved to Dessau in 1925 following an offer from the city. Gropius designed the new Bauhaus Dessau school building in 1925–26 on commission from the city of Dessau. He collaborated with Carl Fieger, Ernst Neufert and others within his private architectural practice. Gropius also designed the Master Houses (Meisterhäuser) (1925–1926) in Dessau, along with the Törten Housing Estate (Siedlung Dessau-Törten) which was built from 1926 to 1928. In 1927 he designed the Dessau City Employment office (Arbeitsamt), but left the Bauhaus and Dessau before construction began. The City Employment office was completed in 1929. He also designed large-scale housing projects in Berlin, Karlsruhe that were major contributions to the New Objectivity movement, including a contribution to the Siemensstadt project in Berlin.

Gropius left the Bauhaus in 1928 and moved to Berlin. Hannes Meyer took over the role of Bauhaus director. His work was also part of the architecture event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics.

=== England (1934–1937) ===
The rise of Hitler in the 1930s would soon drive Gropius out of Germany. Before that, however, he did accept an invitation in early 1933 to compete for the design of the new Reichsbank building and submitted a detailed plan. He also designed furniture, cars, high-rise housing developments Siedlung and an unrealized Palace of the Soviets in Moscow.

Gropius was able to leave Nazi Germany in 1934 with the help of Maxwell Fry on the pretext of making a temporary visit to Italy for a film propaganda festival; he then fled to the United Kingdom to avoid the fascist powers of Europe. Although not Jewish, his association with &quot;degenerate&quot; modern art despised by the Nazis meant he was obliged to emigrate when commissions dried up. He lived and worked in the artists&#x27; community associated with Herbert Read in Hampstead, London, as part of the Isokon group.

=== United States (from 1937) ===
Gropius arrived in the United States in February 1937, while their twelve-year-old daughter, Ati, finished the school year in England. The house the Gropiuses built for themselves in 1938 in Lincoln, Massachusetts (now known as Gropius House) was influential in bringing International Modernism to the US, but Gropius disliked the term: &quot;I made it a point to absorb into my own conception those features of the New England architectural tradition that I found still alive and adequate.&quot; In designing his house, Gropius used the approach developed at the Bauhaus. The Gropiuses believed their house could embody architectural qualities similar to those practiced today, such as simplicity, economy, and aesthetic beauty. 

Helen Storrow, a banker&#x27;s wife and philanthropist, became Gropius&#x27;s benefactor when she invested a portion of her land and wealth for the architect&#x27;s home. She was so satisfied with the result that she gave more land and financial support to four other professors, two of whom Gropius designed homes for. With the Bauhaus philosophy in mind, every aspect of the homes and their surrounding landscapes was planned for maximum efficiency and simplicity. Gropius&#x27;s house received a huge response and was declared a National Landmark in 2000.

Gropius and his Bauhaus protégé Marcel Breuer both moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to teach at the Harvard Graduate School of Design (1937–1952) and collaborate on projects including The Alan I W Frank House in Pittsburgh and the company-town Aluminum City Terrace project in New Kensington, Pennsylvania, before their professional split. In 1938 he was appointed Chair of the Department of Architecture, a post he held until his retirement in 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.britannica.com&quot;&gt;&quot;Walter Gropius&quot;. Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; Gropius also sat on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Visiting Committee at the end of his career. The well-known architect designed the Richards and Child residence halls on the Harvard campus that were built in the 1950s. In 1944, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

Gropius was one of several refugee German architects who provided information to confirm the typical construction of German houses to the RE8 research department set up by the British Air Ministry. This was used to improve the effectiveness of air raids on German cities by the Bomber Command of the Royal Air Force in World War II. The research was to discover the most efficient way of setting fire to houses with incendiary bombs during bombing raids. The findings were used in planning raids such as the bombing of Hamburg in July 1943.

===The Architects Collaborative===
In 1945, Gropius was asked by the young founding members of The Architects Collaborative (TAC) to join as their senior partner. TAC represented a manifestation of his lifelong belief in the significance of teamwork, which he had already successfully introduced at the Bauhaus. Based in Cambridge, the original TAC partners included Norman C. Fletcher, Jean B. Fletcher, John C. Harkness, Sarah P. Harkness, Robert S. MacMillan, Louis A. MacMillen, and Benjamin C. Thompson. Among TAC&#x27;s earliest works were two residential housing developments in Lexington, Massachusetts: Six Moon Hill and Five Fields. Each incorporated contemporary design ideas, reasonable cost, and practical thinking about how to support community life. Another early TAC work is the Graduate Center of Harvard University in Cambridge (1949/50).&lt;ref name=&quot;http://bauhaus-online.de&quot;&gt;&quot;Walter Gropius&quot; . bauhaus-online.de.&lt;/ref&gt; TAC would become one of the most well-known and respected architectural firms in the world before it closed its doors amidst financial problems in 1995.

In 1967, Gropius was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1968.

==Death==
Gropius died on 5 July 1969, in Boston, Massachusetts, aged 86. He had been diagnosed with inflammation of the glands, and was admitted to hospital on 7 June. After an operation was performed successfully on 15 June, there was hope of a full recovery. Gropius described himself as a &quot;tough old bird&quot;, and continued to make progress for about a week. However, his lungs became congested and could not supply proper amounts of oxygen to the blood and brain. He lost consciousness, and died in his sleep.

==Legacy==
Today, Gropius is remembered not only by his various buildings but also by the district of Gropiusstadt in Berlin. In the early 1990s, a series of books entitled The Walter Gropius Archive was published covering his entire architectural career. The CD audiobook &quot;Bauhaus Reviewed 1919–33&quot; includes a lengthy English Language interview with Gropius.

Upon his death his widow, Ise Gropius, arranged to have his collection of papers divided into early and late papers. Both parts were photographed with funds provided by the Thyssen Foundation. The late papers, relating to Gropius&#x27;s career after 1937, and the photos of the early ones, then went to the Houghton Library at Harvard University; the early papers and photos of the late papers went to the Bauhaus Archiv, then in Darmstadt, since reestablished in Berlin. Mrs. Gropius also deeded the Gropius House in Lincoln to Historic New England in 1980, now a house museum. The Gropius House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988 and is now available to the public for tours.

Bauhaus Center Tel Aviv in the White City recognizes the greatest concentration of Bauhaus buildings in the world.

In 1959, he received the AIA Gold Medal. On 17 May 2008, Google Doodle commemorated Walter Gropius&#x27; 125th birthday.

In 1996, the Bauhaus Building and the Master Houses were added to list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

<doc id="33809" wikidata="Q622493" url="?curid=33809" title="Walkman">
<text>is a brand of portable audio players manufactured and marketed by Japanese company Sony since 1979. The original Walkman started out as a portable cassette player and the brand was later extended to serve most of Sony&#x27;s portable audio devices; since 2011 it consists exclusively of digital flash memory players. The current flagship product as of 2022 is the WM1ZM2 player.

Walkman cassette players were very popular during the 1980s, which led to &quot;walkman&quot; becoming an genericized label term for personal compact stereos of any producer or brand. 220 million cassette-type Walkmen were sold by the end of production in 2010; including digital Walkman devices such as DAT, MiniDisc, CD (originally Discman then renamed the CD Walkman) and memory-type media players, it has sold approximately 400 million at this time. The Walkman brand has also been applied to transistor radios, and Sony Ericsson mobile phones.

== History ==

In March 1979, at the request of Masaru Ibuka, the audio department modified the small recorder used by journalists, &quot;Pressman&quot;, into a smaller recorder. After many people praised the good sound quality evaluation, under the leadership of Akio Morita, SONY began to launch the Walkman in July 1979. Akio Morita positioned Walkman in the youth market, emphasized youth, vitality, and fashion, and created a headset culture. In February 1980, he began to sell Walkman to the world, and in November 1980, he began to use the non-standard Japanese and English brands globally. The Walkman has sold more than 250 million units worldwide. When Akio Morita was knighted in October 1992, the headline in the British newspapers The Sun and The Daily Telegraph was &quot;Arise, Sir Sony Walkman&quot; [Doing Cultural Studies: The Story of the Sony Walkman, Paul du Gay]

The Compact Cassette was developed by the Dutch electronics firm Philips and released in August 1963. In the late 1960s, the introduction of prerecorded compact cassettes made it possible to listen to music on portable devices as well as on car stereos, though gramophone records remained the most popular format for home listening.

Portable tape players of various designs were available, but none of them were intended to be operated by a person as they were walking. In the 1970s, Brazilian inventor Andreas Pavel devised a method for carrying a player of this type on a belt around the waist, listening via headphones, but his &quot;Stereobelt&quot; concept did not include the required engineering advancements to yield high-quality sound reproduction while the tape player was subject to mechanical shock as would be expected on a person walking. Pavel later lost his suit claiming the Walkman idea as his own. Finally in 2003, with Pavel threatening to file infringement proceedings in the remaining territories where he held protective rights, Sony approached him with a view to settling the matter amicably, which led to both parties signing a contract and confidentiality agreement in 2004. The settlement was reported to be a cash payment in the &quot;low eight figures&quot; and ongoing royalties of the sale of certain Walkman models.

Sony cofounder Masaru Ibuka used Sony&#x27;s bulky TC-D5 cassette recorder to listen to music while traveling for business. He asked the executive deputy president Norio Ohga to design a playback-only stereo version optimized for walking. The metal-cased blue-and-silver Walkman TPS-L2, the world&#x27;s first low-cost personal stereo, went on sale in Japan on July 1, 1979, and was sold for around ¥33,000 (or $150.00). Though Sony predicted it would sell about 5,000 units a month, it sold more than 30,000 in the first two months.
The Walkman was followed by a series of international releases; as overseas sales companies objected to the &quot;wasei-eigo&quot; name, it was sold under several names, including &quot;Sound-about&quot; in the United States, &quot;Freestyle&quot; in Australia and Sweden, and &quot;Stowaway&quot; in the UK. Eventually, in the early 1980s, &quot;Walkman&quot; caught on globally and Sony used the name worldwide. The TPS-L2 was introduced in the US in June 1980.
The 1980s was the decade of the intensive development of the Walkman lineup. In 1981 Sony released the second Walkman model, the WM-2, which was significantly smaller than the TPS-L2 thanks to the &quot;inverse&quot; mounting of the power-operated magnetic head and soft-touch buttons. Sony applied the &quot;Walkman&quot; brand to some transistor radios starting with the matching blue SRF-40 FM Walkman in 1980, and added a radio system to some Walkman cassette models starting with the model WM-F1 in 1982. The first model with Dolby noise-reduction system and an auto reverse function appeared in 1982.
The first ultra-compact &quot;cassette-size&quot; Walkman was introduced in 1983, model WM-20, with a telescopic case. This allowed even easier carrying of a Walkman in bags or pockets.
In October 1985, the WM-101 model was the first in its class with a &quot;gum stick&quot; rechargeable battery. In 1986 Sony presented the first model outfitted with remote control, as well as one with solar battery (WM-F107).

Within a decade of launch, Sony held a 50% market share in the United States and 46% in Japan.

Two limited edition 10th anniversary models were released in 1989 (WM-701S/T) in Japan, made of brass and plated in sterling silver. Only a few hundred were built of each. A 15th anniversary model was also made on July 1, 1994, with vertical loading, and a 20th anniversary on July 1, 1999, with a prestige model.

By 1989, 10 years after the launch of the first model, over Walkmans had been sold worldwide. units were manufactured by 1995. By 1999, 20 years after the introduction of the first model, Sony sold 186 million cassette Walkmans.

Portable compact disc players led to the decline of the cassette Walkman, which was discontinued in Japan in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC_News_10/25/10_Walkman&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The last cassette-based model available in the US was the WM-FX290W, which was first released in 2004.

== Marketing ==

The marketing of the Walkman helped introduce the idea of &quot;Japanese-ness&quot; into global culture, synonymous with miniaturization and high-technology. The &quot;Walk-men&quot; and &quot;Walk-women&quot; in advertisements were created to be the ideal reflections of the viewing audience. Sony implemented a marketing strategy, hiring young adults to walk around in public wearing a Walkman, offering nearby people to test out the product. Sony also hired actors to pose with the Walkman around the streets of Tokyo as an additional form of promotion.

A major component of the Walkman advertising campaign was overspecialization of the device. Prior to the Walkman, the common device for portable music was the portable radio, which could only offer listeners standard music broadcasts. Having the ability to customize a playlist was a new and exciting revolution in music consumption. Potential buyers had the opportunity to choose their perfect match in terms of mobile listening technology. The ability to play one&#x27;s personal choice of music and listen privately was a huge selling point of the Walkman, especially amongst teens, who greatly contributed to its success. A diversity of features and styles suggested that there would be a product which was &quot;the perfect choice&quot; for each consumer. This method of marketing to an extremely expansive user-base while maintaining the idea that the product was made for each individual &quot;[got] the best of all possible worlds—mass marketing and personal differentiation&quot;.

In the early 2000s, Sony debuted Plato, a blue alien, as its mascot for the Walkman.

== Impact and legacy ==
Culturally the Walkman had a great effect and it became ubiquitous. According to &quot;Time&quot;, the Walkman&#x27;s &quot;unprecedented combination of portability (it ran on two AA batteries) and privacy (it featured a headphone jack but no external speaker) made it the ideal product for thousands of consumers looking for a compact portable stereo that they could take with them anywhere&quot;. According to &quot;The Verge&quot;, &quot;the world changed&quot; on the day the Walkman was released.

The Walkman became an icon in 1980s culture. In 1986, the word &quot;Walkman&quot; entered the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;. Millions used the Walkman during exercise, marking the beginning of the aerobics fad. Between 1987 and 1997, the height of the Walkman&#x27;s popularity, the number of people who said they walked for exercise increased by 30%. Other firms, including Aiwa, Panasonic and Toshiba, produced similar products, and in 1983 cassettes outsold vinyl for the first time.

The Walkman has been cited as influencing people&#x27;s relationship with music and technology, due to its &quot;solitary&quot; and &quot;personal&quot; nature, as users were listening to their music of choice instead of radio. It has been seen as a precursor of personal mainstream tech possessions such as personal computers or mobile phones. Headphones also started to be worn in public. This caused safety controversies in the US, which in 1982 led to the mayor of Woodbridge, New Jersey banning Walkman from being worn in public due to pedestrian accidents.

In the market, the Walkman&#x27;s success also led to great adoption of the Compact Cassette format. Within a few years, cassettes were outselling vinyl records, and would continue to do so until the compact disc (CD) overtook cassette sales in 1991.

In German-speaking countries, the use of &quot;Walkman&quot; became generic, meaning a personal stereo of any make, to a degree that the Austrian Supreme Court of Justice ruled in 2002 that Sony could not prevent others from using the term &quot;Walkman&quot; to describe similar goods. It is therefore an example of what marketing experts call the &quot;genericide&quot; of a brand.

A large statue of a Sports Walkman FM was erected in Tokyo&#x27;s Ginza district in 2019 in celebration of the 40th anniversary.

==Other Walkman==

In 1989, Sony released portable Video8 recorders marketed as &quot;Video Walkman&quot;, extending the brand name. In 1990 Sony released portable Digital Audio Tape (DAT) players marketed as &quot;DAT Walkman&quot;. It was extended further in 1992 for MiniDisc players with the &quot;MD Walkman&quot; brand. From 1997, Sony&#x27;s Discman range of portable compact disc (CD) players started to rebrand as &quot;CD Walkman&quot;. In 2000, the Walkman brand (the entire range) was unified, and a new small icon, &quot;W.&quot;, was made for the branding.

From 2012, Walkman was also the name of the music player software on Sony Xperia. It has since been rebranded to Music.

===Digital players (1999–present)===
On December 21, 1999, Sony launched its first digital audio players (DAP), under the name &quot;Network Walkman&quot; (alongside players developed by the VAIO division). The first player, which used Memory Stick storage medium, was branded as &quot;MS Walkman&quot;, shortly before the Walkman brand unification. Most future models would use built-in solid-state flash memory, although hard disk based players were also released from 2004 to 2007. They came with OpenMG copyright protection and, until 2004, exclusively supported Sony&#x27;s in-house ATRAC format; there was no support for industry-standard MP3 as Sony wanted to protect its records division, Sony BMG, from piracy. Additionally, Walkman-branded mobile phones were also made by the Sony Ericsson joint venture.

Sony could not repeat the success of the cassette player in the 21st-century digital audio player (DAP) market. Rival Apple&#x27;s iPod range became a large success in the market, hindering Walkman sales internationally, though it fared better domestically. The Network Walkman for several years had paltry market share and had also been struggling against numerous other rivals such as Creative, Rio, Mpio and iRiver, although sales and share did eventually increase fivefold in 2005 and continued improving, but remained small. Its pricing policy, SonicStage software and lack of MP3 support in earlier years have been suggested factors of its performance. Its U.S. market share in 2006 was 1.9%, placing it behind Apple, SanDisk, Creative and Samsung. In Japan its share in 2009–2010 was between 43 and 48%, slightly ahead of Apple.

Meanwhile, Sony Computer Entertainment, a Sony division who are not involved in Walkman products, officially described their PlayStation Portable in 2004 as the &quot;21st century Walkman&quot;.

====Current range====

Walkman portable digital audio and media players are the only Walkman-branded products still being produced today – although the &quot;Network&quot; prefix is no longer being used, the model numbers still carry the &quot;NW-&quot; prefix. The current product range as of 2022 are:
*A Series – flagship mid-range players
*B Series (except Japan) – budget-oriented thumb style music players
*E Series – entry level players
*S Series (Japan) – entry level players
*W/WS Series – wearable music players
*WM1 Series – flagship luxurious high-end players (part of Sony&#x27;s &quot;Signature Series&quot; of audio products)
*ZX Series – high-end music players

Since 2017, Sony provided the Music Center for PC software on Microsoft Windows, designed for both content transfer and playback for Walkman and other audio products.

<text>William Seward Burroughs I (January 28, 1857 – September 14, 1898) was an American inventor born in Rochester, New York.

==Life and career==
=== Personal life ===
Burroughs was the son of a mechanic and worked with machines throughout his childhood. While a small boy, his parents moved to Auburn, New York, where he and his brothers were educated in public schools.

He married his wife, Ida (née Selover) in 1879. They had two sons and two daughters: Jennie, Horace, Mortimer (father of William S. Burroughs II), and Helen.

=== Inventor ===
In 1875, he started working as a bank clerk. Much of his job consisted of laboriously reviewing ledgers for errors. Burroughs then became interested in developing an adding machine. At the bank, there had been a number of prototypes, but in inexperienced hands, they would sometimes give incorrect answers. Burroughs&#x27; did not find his clerical work agreeable, as he was fond of mechanics. He resigned after seven years working as a clerk.

In the early 1880s, Burroughs was advised by a doctor to move to an area with a warmer climate. He moved to St. Louis, Missouri where he worked in the Boyer Machine Shop. These new surroundings hastened the development of an existing idea: an adding machine. His new job gave him the opportunity to build his prototype. Accuracy was the foundation of his work. He made his design drawings on metal plates to prevent distortion. 

Burroughs filed his first patent for the invention of a &quot;calculating machine&quot; in 1885. It was designed to ease the monotony of clerical arithmetic. By 1890, they were well known in the banking industry, and adoption spread.

== Company founder ==
Burroughs founded the American Arithmometer Company in 1886. After his death, in 1904 partner John Boyer renamed the business the Burroughs Adding Machine Company.

He was awarded the Franklin Institute&#x27;s John Scott Legacy Medal shortly before his death. He was posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. He was the grandfather of Beat Generation writer William S. Burroughs and great-grandfather of William S. Burroughs Jr., who was also a writer.

Burroughs also received a patent for an electric alarm clock in 1892.

He died in Citronelle, Mobile County, Alabama and was interred in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri.

<text>Wernigerode () is a town in the district of Harz, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Until 2007, it was the capital of the district of Wernigerode. Its population was 32,181 in 2020.

Wernigerode is located southwest of Halberstadt, and is picturesquely situated on the Holtemme river, on the northern slopes of the Harz Mountains. Wernigerode is located on the German Timber-Frame Road.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The town lies at about above sea level (NN) on the northeastern flank of the Harz Mountains in central Germany, at the foot of their highest peak, the Brocken, on the B 6 and B 244 federal highways and on the railway line from Halberstadt to Vienenburg that links the cities of Halle (Saale) and Hanover.

The River Holtemme flows through the town and, not far from its western gate, it is joined by the Zillierbach stream, which is also known as the near its mouth. North of the town the Barrenbach flows through several ponds and empties into the in the village of Minsleben. The historic town centre consists of an old town and a new town ( and ). The town&#x27;s borough includes Hasserode, Nöschenrode, the residential estates of Stadtfeld, Burgbreite and Harzblick as well as the villages of Benzingerode, Minsleben, Silstedt, Schierke and Reddeber.

The borough measures from west to east and from north to south. Its highest point is the Brocken, at above NN, and its lowest is at .

The town lies on the German-Dutch holiday road known as the Orange Route.

The Northern Harz Boundary Fault crosses the borough along which runs the watershed between the Weser and Elbe rivers. To the north precipitation flows into the Weser, to the southeast, later northeast, waters flow into the Elbe. This fault line runs through the suburb of Hasserode to the west south west of the city centre and forms the town&#x27;s castle hill to the south east of the city centre.

=== Town divisions ===
The town of Wernigerode is divided into the town itself, including the villages of Hasserode and Nöschenrode incorporated before 1994, and five villages with their own local councils that were integrated after 1994: Benzingerode, Minsleben, Reddeber, Schierke and Silstedt.

=== Climate ===

Wernigerode is located in the Central European transition subzone of the temperate climatic zone. Its average annual temperature is ; its average annual precipitation is .

The warmest months are June to August with average temperatures of and the coldest are December to February at .

The most rain falls in July, on average , the least in February, with on average.

The climate, more precisely the amounts of precipitation and temperatures, are influenced by the orographic rainfall caused by the Harz Mountains. Because the town lies in the rain shadow (leeward side) of the Harz, less precipitation falls here than in similar temperate regions without the protection of a mountain range. In addition the occasional föhn winds that occur result in an increase in temperatures.

Wernigerode has a snow load class of 3 according to the German industrial standard, DIN 1055.

== History ==
Wernigerode was the capital of the medieval County of Wernigerode and Stolberg-Wernigerode. In 1815, after the Napoleonic Wars, it became part of the Prussian Province of Saxony. The Hasseröder brewery was founded in Wernigerode in 1872.

After World War II, Wernigerode was included in the new state Saxony-Anhalt within the Soviet occupation zone (relaunched in October 1949 as the German Democratic Republic/East Germany). During the Communist years, the town was very close to the inner German border. Wernigerode became part of the restored state of Saxony-Anhalt in 1990 after German reunification.

=== Emergence of the town ===
There are no written sources confirming exactly when the town was established. According to the latest researchfor example, by Eduard Jacobs and Walther Grossethere were no early relations with the Abbey at Corvey (Weser) and the abbot there, Warin, instead the town name suggests it was a protected clearance settlement.

The first area to be settle was the , where there was a lowland castle, the so-called . In 1805 the ruins of this castle site were demolished. The only part remaining is at 12 which dates to the year 1582. At the time of the first settlelement there was still ancient forest, typical of the Harz, on the heights of the , which had first to be cleared, hence the suffix in the town name which means &#x27;clearing&#x27;.

The town was first mentioned in the records in 1121 in connection with Count Adalbert of Haimar who had moved here from the region near Hildesheim and henceforth was titled the Count of Wernigerode. On 17 April 1229 the settlement was granted town rights along the lines of that for Goslar. In 2004 Wernigerode celebrated the 775th anniversary of that occasion.

As a result of the immigration of new townsfolk from the surrounding villages a new settlement, later called , grew up on the northeastern edge of the old town. It was a farming settlement that lay outside the walls of the old town. St. John&#x27;s Church was built as the parish church of Wernigerode&#x27;s in the last third of the 13th century in the Romanesque style.

===Early rulers===
The counts of Wernigerode, who can be traced back to the early 12th century, were successively vassals of the margraves of Brandenburg (1268), and the archbishops of Magdeburg (1381). On the extinction of the family in 1429 the county fell to the counts of Stolberg, who founded the Stolberg-Wernigerode branch in 1645. The latter surrendered its military and fiscal independence to Prussia in 1714, but retained some of its sovereign rights till 1876. The counts were raised to princely rank in 1890.

<doc id="33816" wikidata="Q128444" url="?curid=33816" title="Watchmen">
<text>Watchmen is a comic book limited series by the British creative team of writer Alan Moore, artist Dave Gibbons, and colorist John Higgins. It was published monthly by DC Comics in 1986 and 1987 before being collected in a single-volume edition in 1987. &quot;Watchmen&quot; originated from a story proposal Moore submitted to DC featuring superhero characters that the company had acquired from Charlton Comics. As Moore&#x27;s proposed story would have left many of the characters unusable for future stories, managing editor Dick Giordano convinced Moore to create original characters instead.

Moore used the story as a means of reflecting contemporary anxieties, deconstructing and satirizing the superhero concept, and making political commentary. &quot;Watchmen&quot; depicts an alternate history in which superheroes emerged in the 1940s and 1960s and their presence changed history so that the United States won the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal was never exposed. In 1985, the country is edging toward World War III with the Soviet Union, freelance costumed vigilantes have been outlawed and most former superheroes are in retirement or working for the government. The story focuses on the protagonists&#x27; personal development and moral struggles as an investigation into the murder of a government-sponsored superhero pulls them out of retirement.

Gibbons uses a nine-panel grid layout throughout the series and adds recurring symbols such as a blood-stained smiley face. All but the last issue feature supplemental fictional documents that add to the series&#x27; backstory and the narrative is intertwined with that of another story, an in-story pirate comic titled &quot;Tales of the Black Freighter&quot;, which one of the characters reads. Structured at times as a nonlinear narrative, the story skips through space, time, and plot. In the same manner, entire scenes and dialogues have parallels with others through synchronicity, coincidence, and repeated imagery.

A commercial success, &quot;Watchmen&quot; has received critical acclaim both in the comics and mainstream press. &quot;Watchmen&quot; was recognized in &quot;Time&quot;″s List of the 100 Best Novels as one of the best English language novels published since 1923. In a retrospective review, the BBC&#x27;s Nicholas Barber described it as &quot;the moment comic books grew up&quot;. Moore opposed this idea, stating, &quot;I tend to think that, no, comics hadn&#x27;t grown up. There were a few titles that were more adult than people were used to. But the majority of comics titles were pretty much the same as they&#x27;d ever been. It wasn&#x27;t comics growing up. I think it was more comics meeting the emotional age of the audience coming the other way.&quot;

After several attempts to adapt the series into a feature film, director Zack Snyder&#x27;s &quot;Watchmen&quot; was released in 2009. An episodic video game, &quot;&quot;, was released to coincide with the film&#x27;s release.

DC Comics published &quot;Before Watchmen&quot;, a series of nine prequel miniseries, in 2012, and &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, a 12-issue limited series and sequel to the original &quot;Watchmen&quot; series, from 2017 to 2019 – both without Moore&#x27;s or Gibbons&#x27; involvement. The second series integrated the &quot;Watchmen&quot; characters within the DC Universe. A standalone sequel, &quot;Rorschach&quot; by Tom King, began publication in October 2020. A television continuation to the original comic, set 34 years after the comic&#x27;s timeline, was broadcast on HBO from October to December 2019 with Gibbons&#x27; involvement. Moore has expressed his displeasure with adaptations and sequels of &quot;Watchmen&quot; and asked it not be used for future works.

== Publication history ==
A single preview page for &quot;Watchmen&quot;, created by writer Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons, first appeared in the 1985 issue of &quot;DC Spotlight&quot;, the 50th anniversary special. The title was later published as a 12-issue maxiseries from DC Comics, cover-dated September 1986 to October 1987.

It was subsequently collected in 1987 as a DC Comics trade paperback that has had at least 24 printings as of March 2017; another trade paperback was published by Warner Books, a DC sister company, in 1987. In February 1988, DC published a limited-edition, slipcased hardcover volume, produced by Graphitti Design, that contained 48 pages of bonus material, including the original proposal and concept art. In 2005, DC released &quot;Absolute Watchmen&quot;, an oversized slipcased hardcover edition of the series in DC&#x27;s Absolute Edition format. Assembled under the supervision of Dave Gibbons, &quot;Absolute Watchmen&quot; included the Graphitti materials, as well as restored and recolored art by John Higgins. That December DC published a new printing of &quot;Watchmen&quot; issue #1 at the original 1986 cover price of $1.50 as part of its &quot;Millennium Edition&quot; line.

In 2012, DC published &quot;Before Watchmen&quot;, a series of nine prequel miniseries, with various creative teams producing the characters&#x27; early adventures set before the events of the original series.

In the 2016 one-shot &quot;DC Universe: Rebirth Special&quot;, numerous symbols and visual references to &quot;Watchmen&quot;, such as the blood-splattered smiley face, and the dialogue between Doctor Manhattan and Ozymandias in the last issue of &quot;Watchmen&quot;, are shown. Further &quot;Watchmen&quot; imagery was added in the &quot;DC Universe: Rebirth Special&quot; #1 second printing, which featured an update to Gary Frank&#x27;s cover, better revealing the outstretched hand of Doctor Manhattan in the top right corner. Doctor Manhattan later appeared in the 2017 four-part DC miniseries &quot;The Button&quot; serving as a direct sequel to both &quot;DC Universe Rebirth&quot; and the 2011 storyline &quot;Flashpoint&quot;. Manhattan reappears in the 2017–19 twelve-part sequel series &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;.

== Background and creation ==
In 1983, DC Comics acquired a line of characters from Charlton Comics. During that period, writer Alan Moore contemplated writing a story that featured an unused line of superheroes that he could revamp, as he had done in his &quot;Miracleman&quot; series in the early 1980s. Moore reasoned that MLJ Comics&#x27; Mighty Crusaders might be available for such a project, so he devised a murder mystery plot which would begin with the discovery of the body of the Shield in a harbor. The writer felt it did not matter which set of characters he ultimately used, as long as readers recognized them &quot;so it would have the shock and surprise value when you saw what the reality of these characters was&quot;. Moore used this premise and crafted a proposal featuring the Charlton characters titled &quot;Who Killed the Peacemaker&quot;, and submitted the unsolicited proposal to DC managing editor Dick Giordano. Giordano was receptive to the proposal, but opposed the idea of using the Charlton characters for the story. After the acquisition of Charlton&#x27;s Action Hero line, DC intended to use their upcoming Crisis on Infinite Earths event to fold them into their mainstream superhero universe. Moore said, &quot;DC realized their expensive characters would end up either dead or dysfunctional.&quot; Instead, Giordano persuaded Moore to continue his project but with new characters that simply resembled the Charlton heroes. Moore had initially believed that original characters would not provide emotional resonance for readers but later changed his mind. He said, &quot;Eventually, I realized that if I wrote the substitute characters well enough, so that they seemed familiar in certain ways, certain aspects of them brought back a kind of generic super-hero resonance or familiarity to the reader, then it might work.&quot;

Artist Dave Gibbons, who had collaborated with Moore on previous projects, recalled that he &quot;must have heard on the grapevine that he was doing a treatment for a new miniseries. I rang Alan up, saying I&#x27;d like to be involved with what he was doing&quot;, and Moore sent him the story outline. Gibbons told Giordano he wanted to draw the series Moore proposed and Moore approved. Gibbons brought colorist John Higgins onto the project because he liked his &quot;unusual&quot; style; Higgins lived near the artist, which allowed the two to &quot;discuss [the art] and have some kind of human contact rather than just sending it across the ocean&quot;. Len Wein joined the project as its editor, while Giordano stayed on to oversee it. Both Wein and Giordano stood back and &quot;got out of their way&quot;, as Giordano remarked later. &quot;Who copy-edits Alan Moore, for God&#x27;s sake?&quot;

After receiving the go-ahead to work on the project, Moore and Gibbons spent a day at the latter&#x27;s house creating characters, crafting details for the story&#x27;s milieu and discussing influences. The pair were particularly influenced by a &quot;Mad&quot; parody of Superman named &quot;Superduperman&quot;; Moore said: &quot;We wanted to take Superduperman 180 degrees—dramatic, instead of comedic&quot;. Moore and Gibbons conceived of a story that would take &quot;familiar old-fashioned superheroes into a completely new realm&quot;; Moore said his intention was to create &quot;a superhero &quot;Moby Dick&quot;; something that had that sort of weight, that sort of density&quot;. Moore came up with the character names and descriptions but left the specifics of how they looked to Gibbons. Gibbons did not sit down and design the characters deliberately, but rather &quot;did it at odd times [...] spend[ing] maybe two or three weeks just doing sketches.&quot; Gibbons designed his characters to make them easy to draw; Rorschach was his favorite to draw because &quot;you just have to draw a hat. If you can draw a hat, then you&#x27;ve drawn Rorschach, you just draw kind of a shape for his face and put some black blobs on it and you&#x27;re done.&quot;

Moore began writing the series very early on, hoping to avoid publication delays such as those faced by the DC limited series &quot;Camelot 3000&quot;. When writing the script for the first issue Moore said he realized &quot;I only had enough plot for six issues. We were contracted for 12!&quot; His solution was to alternate issues that dealt with the overall plot of the series with origin issues for the characters. Moore wrote very detailed scripts for Gibbons to work from. Gibbons recalled that &quot;[t]he script for the first issue of &quot;Watchmen&quot; was, I think, 101 pages of typescript—single-spaced—with no gaps between the individual panel descriptions or, indeed, even between the pages.&quot; Upon receiving the scripts, the artist had to number each page &quot;in case I drop them on the floor, because it would take me two days to put them back in the right order&quot;, and used a highlighter pen to single out lettering and shot descriptions; he remarked, &quot;It takes quite a bit of organizing before you can actually put pen to paper.&quot; Despite Moore&#x27;s detailed scripts, his panel descriptions would often end with the note &quot;If that doesn&#x27;t work for you, do what works best&quot;; Gibbons nevertheless worked to Moore&#x27;s instructions. In fact, Gibbons only suggested one single change to the script – a compression of Ozymandias&#x27; narration while he was preventing a sneak attack by Rorschach – as he felt that the dialogue was too long to fit with the length of the action; Moore agreed and re-wrote the scene. Gibbons had a great deal of autonomy in developing the visual look of &quot;Watchmen&quot; and frequently inserted background details that Moore admitted he did not notice until later. Moore occasionally contacted fellow comics writer Neil Gaiman for answers to research questions and for quotes to include in issues.

Despite his intentions, Moore admitted in November 1986 that there were likely to be delays, stating that he was, with issue five on the stands, still writing issue nine. Gibbons mentioned that a major factor in the delays was the &quot;piecemeal way&quot; in which he received Moore&#x27;s scripts. Gibbons said the team&#x27;s pace slowed around the fourth issue; from that point onward the two undertook their work &quot;just several pages at a time. I&#x27;ll get three pages of script from Alan and draw it and then toward the end, call him up and say, &#x27;Feed me!&#x27; And he&#x27;ll send another two or three pages or maybe one page or sometimes six pages.&quot; As the creators began to hit deadlines, Moore would hire a taxi driver to drive 50 miles and deliver scripts to Gibbons. On later issues the artist even had his wife and son draw panel grids on pages to help save time.

Near the end of the project, Moore realized that the story bore some similarity to &quot;The Architects of Fear&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; television series. The writer and Wein (an editor) argued over changing the ending and when Moore refused to give in, Wein quit the book. Wein explained, &quot;I kept telling him, &#x27;Be more original, Alan, you&#x27;ve got the capability, do something different, not something that&#x27;s already been done!&#x27; And he didn&#x27;t seem to care enough to do that.&quot; Moore acknowledged the &quot;Outer Limits&quot; episode by referencing it in the series&#x27; last issue.

== Synopsis ==
=== Setting ===
&quot;Watchmen&quot; is set in an alternate reality that closely mirrors the contemporary world of the 1980s. The primary difference is the presence of superheroes. The point of divergence occurs in the year 1938. Their existence in this version of the United States is shown to have dramatically affected and altered the outcomes of real-world events such as the Vietnam War and the presidency of Richard Nixon. In keeping with the realism of the series, although the costumed crimefighters of &quot;Watchmen&quot; are commonly called &quot;superheroes&quot;, only one, named Doctor Manhattan, possesses any superhuman abilities. The war in Vietnam ends with an American victory in 1971 and Nixon is still president as of October 1985 upon the repeal of term limits and the Watergate scandal not coming to pass. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan occurs approximately six years later than in real life.

When the story begins, the existence of Doctor Manhattan has given the U.S. a strategic advantage over the Soviet Union, which has dramatically increased Cold War tensions. Eventually, by 1977, superheroes grow unpopular among the police and the public, leading them to be outlawed with the passage of the Keene Act. While many of the heroes retired, Doctor Manhattan and another superhero, known as The Comedian, operate as government-sanctioned agents. Another named Rorschach continues to operate outside the law.

=== Plot ===
In October 1985, New York City detectives investigate the murder of Edward Blake. With the police having no leads, costumed vigilante Rorschach decides to probe further. Rorschach deduces Blake to have been the true identity of &quot;The Comedian&quot;, a costumed hero employed by the U.S. government, after finding his costume and signature smiley-face pin badge. Believing that Blake&#x27;s murder could be part of a larger plot against costumed adventurers, Rorschach seeks out and warns four of his retired comrades: shy inventor Daniel Dreiberg, formerly the second Nite Owl; the superpowered and emotionally detached Jon Osterman, codenamed &quot;Doctor Manhattan&quot;; Doctor Manhattan&#x27;s lover Laurie Juspeczyk, the second Silk Spectre; and Adrian Veidt, once the hero &quot;Ozymandias&quot;, and now a successful businessman.

Dreiberg, Veidt, and Manhattan attend Blake&#x27;s funeral, where Dreiberg tosses Blake&#x27;s pin badge in his coffin before he is buried. Manhattan is later accused on national television of being the cause of cancer in friends and former colleagues. When the government takes the accusations seriously, Manhattan exiles himself to Mars. As the United States depends on Manhattan as a strategic military asset, his departure throws humanity into political turmoil, with the Soviets invading Afghanistan to capitalize on the United States&#x27; perceived weakness. Rorschach&#x27;s concerns appear validated when Veidt narrowly survives an assassination attempt. Rorschach himself is framed for murdering a former supervillain named Moloch. While attempting to flee the scene of Moloch&#x27;s murder, Rorschach is captured by police and unmasked as Walter Kovacs.

Neglected in her relationship with the once-human Manhattan, whose godlike powers have left him emotionally detached from ordinary people, and no longer kept on retainer by the government, Juspeczyk stays with Dreiberg. They begin a romance, don their costumes, and resume vigilante work as they grow closer together. With Dreiberg starting to believe some aspects of Rorschach&#x27;s conspiracy theory, the pair take it upon themselves to break him out of prison. After looking back on his own personal history, Manhattan places the fate of his involvement with human affairs in Juspeczyk&#x27;s hands. He teleports her to Mars to make the case for emotional investment. During the course of the argument, Juspeczyk is forced to come to terms with the fact that Blake, who once attempted to rape her mother (the original Silk Spectre), was actually her biological father, having fathered her in a second, consensual relationship. This discovery, reflecting the complexity of human emotions and relationships, reignites Manhattan&#x27;s interest in humanity.

On Earth, Dreiberg and Rorschach find evidence that Veidt may be behind the conspiracy. Rorschach writes his suspicions about Veidt in his journal, which includes the full details of his investigation, and mails it to &quot;New Frontiersman&quot;, a local right-wing newspaper. When Rorschach and Dreiberg travel to Antarctica to confront Veidt at his private retreat, Veidt explains that he plans to save humanity from an impending nuclear war by staging a fake alien invasion and killing half the population of New York, forcing the United States and the Soviet Union to unite against a common enemy. He reveals that he murdered Blake after he discovered his plan, arranged for Doctor Manhattan&#x27;s past associates to contract cancer to force him to leave Earth, staged the attempt on his own life to place himself above suspicion, and framed Rorschach for Moloch&#x27;s murder to prevent him from discovering the truth. Horrified by Veidt&#x27;s callous logic, Dreiberg and Rorschach vow to stop him, but Veidt reveals that he already enacted his plan before they arrived.

When Manhattan and Juspeczyk arrive back on Earth, they are confronted by mass destruction and death in New York, with a gigantic squid-like creature, created by Veidt&#x27;s laboratories, dead in the middle of the city. Manhattan notices his prescient abilities are limited by tachyons emanating from the Antarctic and the pair teleport there. They discover Veidt&#x27;s involvement and confront him. Veidt shows everyone news broadcasts confirming that the emergence of a new threat has indeed prompted peaceful co-operation between the superpowers; this leads almost all present to agree that concealing the truth is in the best interests of world peace. Rorschach refuses to compromise and leaves, intent on revealing the truth. As he is making his way back, he is confronted by Manhattan who argues that at this point, the truth can only hurt. Rorschach declares that Manhattan will have to kill him to stop him from exposing Veidt, which Manhattan duly does. Manhattan then wanders through the base and finds Veidt, who asks him if he did the right thing in the end. Manhattan cryptically responds that &quot;nothing ever ends&quot; before leaving Earth. Dreiberg and Juspeczyk go into hiding under new identities and continue their romance.

Back in New York, the editor at &quot;New Frontiersman&quot; asks his assistant to find some filler material from the &quot;crank file&quot;, a collection of rejected submissions to the paper, many of which have not yet been reviewed. The series ends with the young man reaching toward the pile of discarded submissions, near the top of which is Rorschach&#x27;s journal.

== Characters ==


With &quot;Watchmen&quot;, Alan Moore&#x27;s intention was to create four or five &quot;radically opposing ways&quot; to perceive the world and to give readers of the story the privilege of determining which one was most morally comprehensible. Moore did not believe in the notion of &quot;[cramming] regurgitated morals&quot; down the readers&#x27; throats and instead sought to show heroes in an ambivalent light. Moore said, &quot;What we wanted to do was show all of these people, warts and all. Show that even the worst of them had something going for them, and even the best of them had their flaws.&quot;

; Walter Joseph Kovacs / Rorschach
: A vigilante who wears a white mask that contains a symmetrical but constantly shifting ink blot pattern, he continues to fight crime in spite of his outlaw status. Moore said he was trying to &quot;come up with this quintessential Steve Ditko character—someone who&#x27;s got a funny name, whose surname begins with a &#x27;K,&#x27; who&#x27;s got an oddly designed mask&quot;. Moore based Rorschach on Ditko&#x27;s creation Mr. A; Ditko&#x27;s Charlton character The Question also served as a template for creating Rorschach. Comics historian Bradford W. Wright described the character&#x27;s world view &quot;a set of black-and-white values that take many shapes but never mix into shades of gray, similar to the ink blot tests of his namesake&quot;. Rorschach sees existence as random and, according to Wright, this viewpoint leaves the character &quot;free to &#x27;scrawl [his] own design&#x27; on a &#x27;morally blank world&#x27;&quot;. Moore said he did not foresee the death of Rorschach until the fourth issue when he realized that his refusal to compromise would result in him not surviving the story.

;Adrian Veidt / Ozymandias: Drawing inspiration from Alexander the Great, Veidt was once the superhero Ozymandias, but has since retired to devote his attention to the running of his own enterprises. Veidt is believed to be the smartest man on the planet. Ozymandias was based on Peter Cannon, Thunderbolt; Moore liked the idea of a character who &quot;us[ed] the full 100% of his brain&quot; and &quot;[had] complete physical and mental control&quot;. Richard Reynolds noted that by taking initiative to &quot;help the world&quot;, Veidt displays a trait normally attributed to villains in superhero stories, and in a sense he is the &quot;villain&quot; of the series. Gibbons noted, &quot;One of the worst of his sins [is] kind of looking down on the rest of humanity, scorning the rest of humanity.&quot;
;Daniel Dreiberg / Nite Owl II: A retired superhero who utilizes owl-themed gadgets. Nite Owl was based on the Ted Kord version of the Blue Beetle. Paralleling the way Ted Kord had a predecessor, Moore also incorporated an earlier adventurer who used the name &quot;Nite Owl&quot;, the retired crime fighter Hollis Mason, into &quot;Watchmen&quot;. While Moore devised character notes for Gibbons to work from, the artist provided a name and a costume design for Hollis Mason he had created when he was twelve. Richard Reynolds noted in &quot;Super Heroes: A Modern Mythology&quot; that despite the character&#x27;s Charlton roots, Nite Owl&#x27;s modus operandi has more in common with the DC Comics character Batman. According to Klock, his civilian form &quot;visually suggests an impotent, middle-aged Clark Kent.&quot;
;Edward Blake / The Comedian: One of two government-sanctioned heroes (along with Doctor Manhattan) who remains active after the Keene Act is passed in 1977 to ban superheroes. His murder, which occurs shortly before the first chapter begins, sets the plot of &quot;Watchmen&quot; in motion. The character appears throughout the story in flashbacks and aspects of his personality are revealed by other characters. The Comedian was based on the Charlton Comics character Peacemaker, with elements of the Marvel Comics spy character Nick Fury added. Moore and Gibbons saw The Comedian as &quot;a kind of Gordon Liddy character, only a much bigger, tougher guy&quot;. Richard Reynolds described The Comedian as &quot;ruthless, cynical, and nihilistic, and yet capable of deeper insights than the others into the role of the costumed hero.&quot;
;Dr. Jon Osterman / Doctor Manhattan: A superpowered being who is contracted by the United States government. Scientist Jon Osterman gained power over matter when he was caught in an &quot;Intrinsic Field Subtractor&quot; in 1959. Doctor Manhattan was based upon Charlton&#x27;s Captain Atom, who in Moore&#x27;s original proposal was surrounded by the shadow of nuclear threat. Captain Atom was the only hero with actual superpowers in Dick Giordano&#x27;s Action Hero line at Charlton, just like Manhattan is the only character with actual superpowers in Watchmen. However, the writer found he could do more with Manhattan as a &quot;kind of a quantum super-hero&quot; than he could have with Captain Atom. In contrast to other superheroes who lacked scientific exploration of their origins, Moore sought to delve into nuclear physics and quantum physics in constructing the character of Dr. Manhattan. The writer believed that a character living in a quantum universe would not perceive time with a linear perspective, which would influence the character&#x27;s perception of human affairs. Moore also wanted to avoid creating an emotionless character like Spock from &quot;Star Trek&quot;, so he sought for Dr. Manhattan to retain &quot;human habits&quot; and to grow away from them and humanity in general. Gibbons had created the blue character Rogue Trooper and explained he reused the blue skin motif for Doctor Manhattan as it visualized electrical or atomic energy while still resembling human skin tonally and &quot;reading as Jon Osterman&#x27;s skin would&#x27;ve read, but in a different hue.&quot; Moore incorporated the color into the story, and Gibbons noted the rest of the comic&#x27;s color scheme made Manhattan unique. Moore recalled that he was unsure if DC would allow the creators to depict the character as fully nude, which partially influenced how they portrayed the character. Gibbons wanted to be tasteful in depicting Manhattan&#x27;s nudity, selecting carefully when full frontal shots would occur and giving him &quot;understated&quot; genitals—like a classical sculpture—so the reader would not initially notice it.
;Laurie Juspeczyk / Silk Spectre II: The daughter of Sally Jupiter (the first Silk Spectre, with whom she has a strained relationship) and The Comedian. Of Polish heritage, she had been the lover of Doctor Manhattan for years. While Silk Spectre was originally supposed to be the Charlton superheroine Nightshade, Moore was not particularly interested in that character. Once the idea of using Charlton characters was abandoned, Moore drew more from heroines such as Black Canary and Phantom Lady. A University of Dayton student paper described Laurie as impulsive—&quot;rarely using logic to think through situations&quot;—but also as constantly standing by her belief that each human life matters, which contrasts with most other characters in &quot;Watchmen&quot;.:

== Art and composition ==

Moore and Gibbons designed &quot;Watchmen&quot; to showcase the unique qualities of the comics medium and to highlight its particular strengths. In a 1986 interview, Moore said, &quot;What I&#x27;d like to explore is the areas that comics succeed in where no other media is capable of operating&quot;, and emphasized this by stressing the differences between comics and film. Moore said that &quot;Watchmen&quot; was designed to be read &quot;four or five times&quot;, with some links and allusions only becoming apparent to the reader after several readings. Dave Gibbons notes that, &quot;[a]s it progressed, &quot;Watchmen&quot; became much more about the telling than the tale itself. The main thrust of the story essentially hinges on what is called a macguffin, a gimmick ... So really the plot itself is of no great consequence ... it just really isn&#x27;t the most interesting thing about &quot;Watchmen&quot;. As we actually came to tell the tale, that&#x27;s where the real creativity came in.&quot;

Gibbons said he deliberately constructed the visual look of &quot;Watchmen&quot; so that each page would be identifiable as part of that particular series and &quot;not some other comic book&quot;. He made a concerted effort to draw the characters in a manner different from that commonly seen in comics. The artist tried to draw the series with &quot;a particular weight of line, using a hard, stiff pen that didn&#x27;t have much modulation in terms of thick and thin&quot; which he hoped &quot;would differentiate it from the usual lush, fluid kind of comic book line&quot;. In a 2009 interview, Moore recalled that he took advantage of Gibbons&#x27; training as a former surveyor for &quot;including incredible amounts of detail in every tiny panel, so we could choreograph every little thing&quot;. Gibbons described the series as &quot;a comic about comics&quot;. Gibbons felt that &quot;Alan is more concerned with the social implications of [the presence of super-heroes] and I&#x27;ve gotten involved in the technical implications.&quot; The story&#x27;s alternate world setting allowed Gibbons to change details of the American landscape, such as adding electric cars, slightly different buildings, and spark hydrants instead of fire hydrants, which Moore said, &quot;perhaps gives the American readership a chance in some ways to see their own culture as an outsider would&quot;. Gibbons noted that the setting was liberating for him because he did not have to rely primarily on reference books.

Colorist John Higgins used a template that was &quot;moodier&quot; and favored secondary colors. Moore stated that he had also &quot;always loved John&#x27;s coloring, but always associated him with being an airbrush colorist&quot;, which Moore was not fond of; Higgins subsequently decided to color &quot;Watchmen&quot; in European-style flat color. Moore noted that the artist paid particular attention to lighting and subtle color changes; in issue six, Higgins began with &quot;warm and cheerful&quot; colors and throughout the issue gradually made it darker to give the story a dark and bleak feeling.

=== Structure ===
Structurally, certain aspects of &quot;Watchmen&quot; deviated from the norm in comic books at the time, particularly the panel layout and the coloring. Instead of panels of various sizes, the creators divided each page into a nine-panel grid. Gibbons favored the nine-panel grid system due to its &quot;authority&quot;. Moore accepted the use of the nine-panel grid format, which &quot;gave him a level of control over the storytelling he hadn&#x27;t had previously&quot;, according to Gibbons. &quot;There was this element of the pacing and visual impact that he could now predict and use to dramatic effect.&quot; Bhob Stewart of &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; mentioned to Gibbons in 1987, that the page layouts recalled those of EC Comics, in addition to the art itself, which Stewart felt particularly echoed that of John Severin. Gibbons agreed that the echoing of the EC-style layouts &quot;was a very deliberate thing&quot;, although his inspiration was rather Harvey Kurtzman, but it was altered enough to give the series a unique look. The artist also cited Steve Ditko&#x27;s work on early issues of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; as an influence, as well as &quot;Doctor Strange&quot;, where &quot;even at his most psychedelic [he] would still keep a pretty straight page layout&quot;.

The cover of each issue serves as the first panel to the story. Gibbons said, &quot;The cover of the &quot;Watchmen&quot; is in the real world and looks quite real, but it&#x27;s starting to turn into a comic book, a portal to another dimension.&quot; The covers were designed as close-ups that focused on a single detail with no human elements present. The creators on occasion experimented with the layout of the issue contents. Gibbons drew issue five, titled &quot;Fearful Symmetry&quot;, so the first page mirrors the last (in terms of frame disposition), with the following pages mirroring each other before the center-spread is (broadly) symmetrical in layout.

The end of each issue, with the exception of issue twelve, contains supplemental prose pieces written by Moore. Among the contents are fictional book chapters, letters, reports, and articles written by various &quot;Watchmen&quot; characters. DC had trouble selling ad space in issues of &quot;Watchmen&quot;, which left an extra eight to nine pages per issue. DC planned to insert house ads and a longer letters column to fill the space, but editor Len Wein felt this would be unfair to anyone who wrote in during the last four issues of the series. He decided to use the extra pages to fill in the series&#x27; backstory. Moore said, &quot;By the time we got around to issue #3, #4, and so on, we thought that the book looked nice without a letters page. It looks less like a comic book, so we stuck with it.&quot;

=== &quot;Tales of the Black Freighter&quot; ===
&quot;Watchmen&quot; features a story within a story in the form of &quot;Tales of the Black Freighter&quot;, a fictional comic book from which scenes appear in issues three, five, eight, ten, and eleven. The fictional comic&#x27;s story, &quot;Marooned&quot;, is read by a youth in New York City. Moore and Gibbons conceived a pirate comic because they reasoned that since the characters of &quot;Watchmen&quot; experience superheroes in real life, &quot;they probably wouldn&#x27;t be at all interested in superhero comics.&quot; Gibbons suggested a pirate theme, and Moore agreed in part because he is &quot;a big Bertolt Brecht fan&quot;: the &quot;Black Freighter&quot; alludes to the song &quot;Seeräuberjenny&quot; (&quot;Pirate Jenny&quot;) from Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Threepenny Opera&quot;. Moore theorized that since superheroes existed, and existed as &quot;objects of fear, loathing, and scorn, the main superheroes quickly fell out of popularity in comic books, as we suggest. Mainly, genres like horror, science fiction, and piracy, particularly piracy, became prominent—with EC riding the crest of the wave.&quot; Moore felt &quot;the imagery of the whole pirate genre is so rich and dark that it provided a perfect counterpoint to the contemporary world of &quot;Watchmen&quot;&quot;. The writer expanded upon the premise so that its presence in the story would add subtext and allegory. The supplemental article detailing the fictional history of &quot;Tales of the Black Freighter&quot; at the end of issue five credits real-life artist Joe Orlando as a major contributor to the series. Moore chose Orlando because he felt that if pirate stories were popular in the &quot;Watchmen&quot; universe that DC editor Julius Schwartz might have tried to lure the artist over to the company to draw a pirate comic book. Orlando contributed a drawing designed as if it were a page from the fake title to the supplemental piece.

In &quot;Marooned&quot;, a young mariner (called &quot;The Sea Captain&quot;) journeys to warn his hometown of the coming of &quot;The Black Freighter&quot;, after he survives the destruction of his own ship. He uses the bodies of his dead shipmates as a makeshift raft and sails home, gradually descending into insanity. When he finally returns to his hometown, believing it to be already under the occupation of &quot;The Black Freighter&quot;″s crew, he makes his way to his house and slays everyone he finds there, only to discover that the person he mistook for a pirate was in fact his wife. He returns to the seashore, where he realizes that &quot;The Black Freighter&quot; has not come to claim the town, but rather to claim him; he swims out to sea and climbs aboard the ship. According to Richard Reynolds, the mariner is &quot;forced by the urgency of his mission to shed one inhibition after another.&quot; Just like Adrian Veidt, he &quot;hopes to stave off disaster by using the dead bodies of his former comrades as a means of reaching his goal&quot;. Moore stated that the story of &quot;The Black Freighter&quot; ends up specifically describing &quot;the story of Adrian Veidt&quot; and that it can also be used as a counterpoint to other parts of the story, such as Rorschach&#x27;s capture and Dr. Manhattan&#x27;s self-exile on Mars.

=== Symbols and imagery ===
Moore named William S. Burroughs as one of his main influences during the conception of &quot;Watchmen&quot;. He admired Burroughs&#x27; use of &quot;repeated symbols that would become laden with meaning&quot; in Burroughs&#x27; only comic strip, &quot;The Unspeakable Mr. Hart&quot;, which appeared in the British underground magazine &quot;Cyclops&quot;. Not every intertextual link in the series was planned by Moore, who remarked that &quot;there&#x27;s stuff in there Dave had put in that even I only noticed on the sixth or seventh read&quot;, while other &quot;things [...] turned up in there by accident.&quot;
A stained smiley face is a recurring image in the story, appearing in many forms. In &quot;The System of Comics&quot;, Thierry Groensteen described the symbol as a recurring motif that produces &quot;rhyme and remarkable configurations&quot; by appearing in key segments of &quot;Watchmen&quot;, notably the first and last pages of the series—spattered with blood on the first, and sauce from a hamburger on the last. Groensteen cites it as one form of the circle shape that appears throughout the story, as a &quot;recurrent geometric motif&quot; and due to its symbolic connotations. Gibbons created a smiley face badge as an element of The Comedian&#x27;s costume in order to &quot;lighten&quot; the overall design, later adding a splash of blood to the badge to imply his murder. Gibbons said the creators came to regard the blood-stained smiley face as &quot;a symbol for the whole series&quot;, noting its resemblance to the Doomsday Clock ticking up to midnight. Moore drew inspiration from psychological tests of behaviorism, explaining that the tests had presented the face as &quot;a symbol of complete innocence&quot;. With the addition of a blood splash over the eye, the face&#x27;s meaning was altered to become simultaneously radical and simple enough for the first issue&#x27;s cover to avoid human detail. Although most evocations of the central image were created on purpose, others were coincidental. Moore mentioned in particular that on &quot;the little plugs on the spark hydrants if you turn them upside down, you discover a little smiley face&quot;.

Other symbols, images, and allusions that appeared throughout the series often emerged unexpectedly. Moore mentioned that &quot;[t]he whole thing with &quot;Watchmen&quot; has just been loads of these little bits of synchronicity popping up all over the place&quot;. Gibbons noted an unintended theme was contrasting the mundane and the romantic, citing the separate sex scenes between Nite Owl and Silk Spectre on his couch and then high in the sky on Nite Owl&#x27;s airship. In a book of the craters and boulders of Mars, Gibbons discovered a photograph of the Galle crater, which resembles a happy face, which they worked into an issue. Moore said, &quot;We found a lot of these things started to generate themselves as if by magic&quot;, in particular citing an occasion where they decided to name a lock company the &quot;Gordian Knot Lock Company&quot;.

== Themes ==
The initial premise of the series was to examine what superheroes would be like &quot;in a credible, real world&quot;. As the story became more complex, Moore said &quot;Watchmen&quot; became about &quot;power and about the idea of the superman manifest within society.&quot; The title of the series refers to the question &quot;Who will watch the watchmen themselves?&quot;, famously posed by the Roman satirist Juvenal (as &quot;Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?&quot;), although Moore was not aware of the phrase&#x27;s classical origins until Harlan Ellison informed him. Moore commented in 1987, &quot;In the context of &quot;Watchmen&quot;, that fits. &#x27;They&#x27;re watching out for us, who&#x27;s watching out for them? The writer stated in the introduction to the Graffiti hardcover of &quot;Watchmen&quot; that while writing the series he was able to purge himself of his nostalgia for superheroes, and instead he found an interest in real human beings.
Bradford Wright described &quot;Watchmen&quot; as &quot;Moore&#x27;s obituary for the concept of heroes in general and superheroes in particular.&quot; Putting the story in a contemporary sociological context, Wright wrote that the characters of &quot;Watchmen&quot; were Moore&#x27;s &quot;admonition to those who trusted in &#x27;heroes&#x27; and leaders to guard the world&#x27;s fate&quot;. He added that to place faith in such icons was to give up personal responsibility to &quot;the Reagans, Thatchers, and other &#x27;Watchmen&#x27; of the world who supposed to &#x27;rescue&#x27; us and perhaps lay waste to the planet in the process&quot;. Moore specifically stated in 1986 that he was writing &quot;Watchmen&quot; to be &quot;not anti-Americanism, [but] anti-Reaganism&quot;, specifically believing that &quot;at the moment a certain part of Reagan&#x27;s America isn&#x27;t scared. They think they&#x27;re invulnerable.&quot; Before the series premiered, Gibbons stated: &quot;There&#x27;s no overt political message at all. It&#x27;s a fantasy extrapolation of what might happen and if people can see things in it that apply to the real America, then they&#x27;re reading it into the comic [...].&quot; While Moore wanted to write about &quot;power politics&quot; and the &quot;worrying&quot; times he lived in, he stated the reason that the story was set in an alternate reality was because he was worried that readers would &quot;switch off&quot; if he attacked a leader they admired. Moore stated in 1986 that he &quot;was consciously trying to do something that would make people feel uneasy.&quot;

Citing &quot;Watchmen&quot; as the point where the comic book medium &quot;came of age&quot;, Iain Thomson wrote in his essay &quot;Deconstructing the Hero&quot; that the story accomplished this by &quot;developing its heroes precisely in order to &quot;deconstruct&quot; the very idea of the hero and so encouraging us to reflect upon its significance from the many different angles of the shards left lying on the ground&quot;. Thomson stated that the heroes in &quot;Watchmen&quot; almost all share a nihilistic outlook, and that Moore presents this outlook &quot;as the simple, unvarnished truth&quot; to &quot;deconstruct the would-be hero&#x27;s ultimate motivation, namely, to provide a secular salvation and so attain a mortal immortality&quot;. He wrote that the story &quot;develops its heroes precisely in order to ask us if we would not in fact be better off without heroes&quot;. Thomson added that the story&#x27;s deconstruction of the hero concept &quot;suggests that perhaps the time for heroes has passed&quot;, which he feels distinguishes &quot;this postmodern work&quot; from the deconstructions of the hero in the existentialism movement. Richard Reynolds states that without any supervillains in the story, the superheroes of &quot;Watchmen&quot; are forced to confront &quot;more intangible social and moral concerns&quot;, adding that this removes the superhero concept from the normal narrative expectations of the genre. Reynolds concludes that the series&#x27; ironic self-awareness of the genre &quot;all mark out &quot;Watchmen&quot; either as the last key superhero text, or the first in a new maturity of the genre&quot;.

Geoff Klock eschewed the term &quot;deconstruction&quot; in favor of describing &quot;Watchmen&quot; as a &quot;revisionary superhero narrative&quot;. He considers &quot;Watchmen&quot; and Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;&quot; to be &quot;the first instances [...] of [a] new kind of comic book [...] a first phase of development, the transition of the superhero from fantasy to literature.&quot; He elaborates by noting that &quot;Alan Moore&#x27;s realism [...] performs a &quot;kenosis&quot; towards comic book history [...] [which] does not ennoble and empower his characters [...] Rather, it sends a wave of disruption back through superhero history [...] devalue[ing] one of the basic superhero conventions by placing his masked crime fighters in a realistic world&quot;. First and foremost, &quot;Moore&#x27;s exploration of the [often compromised] motives for costumed crimefighting sheds a disturbing light on past superhero stories, and forces the reader to reevaluate—to revision—every superhero in terms of Moore&#x27;s &quot;kenosis&quot;—his emptying out of the tradition&quot;. Klock relates the title to the quote by Juvenal to highlight the problem of controlling those who hold power and quoted repeatedly within the work itself. The deconstructive nature of &quot;Watchmen&quot; is, Klock notes, played out on the page also as, &quot;[l]ike Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;kenosis&quot;, [Veidt] must destroy, then reconstruct, in order to build &#x27;a unity which would survive him.

Moore has expressed dismay that &quot;[t]he gritty, deconstructivist postmodern superhero comic, as exemplified by &quot;Watchmen&quot; [...] became a genre&quot;. He said in 2003 that &quot;to some degree there has been, in the 15 years since &quot;Watchmen&quot;, an awful lot of the comics field devoted to these grim, pessimistic, nasty, violent stories which kind of use &quot;Watchmen&quot; to validate what are, in effect, often just some very nasty stories that don&#x27;t have a lot to recommend them&quot;. Gibbons said that while readers &quot;were left with the idea that it was a grim and gritty kind of thing&quot;, he said in his view the series was &quot;a wonderful celebration of superheroes as much as anything else&quot;.

== Publication and reception ==

&quot;Watchmen&quot; was first mentioned publicly in the 1985 &quot;Amazing Heroes Preview&quot;. When Moore and Gibbons turned in the first issue of their series to DC, Gibbons recalled, &quot;What really clinched it [...] was [writer/artist] Howard Chaykin, who doesn&#x27;t give praise lightly, and who came up and said, &#x27;Dave what you&#x27;ve done on &quot;Watchmen&quot; is freaking A. Speaking in 1986, Moore said, &quot;DC backed us all the way [...] and have been really supportive about even the most graphic excesses&quot;. To promote the series, DC Comics released a limited-edition badge (&quot;button&quot;) display card set, featuring characters and images from the series. Ten thousand sets of the four badges, including a replica of the blood-stained smiley face badge worn by the Comedian in the story, were released and sold. Mayfair Games introduced a &quot;Watchmen&quot; module for its &quot;DC Heroes&quot; Role-playing Game series that was released before the series concluded. The module, which was endorsed by Moore (who also provided story assistance), adds details to the series&#x27; backstory by portraying events that occurred in 1966.

&quot;Watchmen&quot; was published in single-issue form over the course of 1986 and 1987. The limited series was a commercial success, and its sales helped DC Comics briefly overtake its competitor Marvel Comics in the comic book direct market. The series&#x27; publishing schedule ran into delays because it was scheduled with three issues completed instead of the six editor Len Wein believed were necessary. Further delays were caused when later issues each took more than a month to complete. One contemporaneous report noted that although DC solicited issue #12 for publication in April 1987, it became apparent &quot;it [wouldn&#x27;t] debut until July or August&quot;.

After the series concluded, the individual issues were collected and sold in trade paperback form. Along with Frank Miller&#x27;s 1986 &quot;Batman: The Dark Knight Returns&quot; miniseries, &quot;Watchmen&quot; was marketed as a &quot;graphic novel&quot;, a term that allowed DC and other publishers to sell similar comic book collections in a way that associated them with novels and dissociated them from comics. As a result of the publicity given to the books like the &quot;Watchmen&quot; trade in 1987, bookstores and public libraries began to devote special shelves to them. Subsequently, new comics series were commissioned on the basis of reprinting them in a collected form for these markets.

&quot;Watchmen&quot; received critical praise, both inside and outside of the comics industry. &quot;Time&quot; magazine, which noted that the series was &quot;by common assent the best of breed&quot; of the new wave of comics published at the time, praised &quot;Watchmen&quot; as &quot;a superlative feat of imagination, combining sci-fi, political satire, knowing evocations of comics past and bold reworkings of current graphic formats into a mystery story&quot;. In 1988, &quot;Watchmen&quot; received a Hugo Award in the Other Forms category. According to Gibbons, Moore had his award placed upside down in his garden and used it as a bird table.

Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Watchmen&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #96, and stated that &quot;The modern myth of the Superhero is curiously powerful despite its usual silliness; &quot;Watchmen&quot; lovingly disassembles the mythology into bloodstained cogs and ratchets, concluding with the famous quotation &quot;Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?&quot;&quot;

=== Ownership disputes ===
Disagreements about the ownership of the story ultimately led Moore to sever ties with DC Comics. Not wanting to work under a work for hire arrangement, Moore and Gibbons had a reversion clause in their contract for &quot;Watchmen&quot;. Speaking at the 1985 San Diego Comic-Con, Moore said: &quot;The way it works, if I understand it, is that DC owns it for the time they&#x27;re publishing it, and then it reverts to Dave and me, so we can make all the money from the Slurpee cups.&quot; For &quot;Watchmen&quot;, Moore and Gibbons received eight percent of the series&#x27; earnings. Moore explained in 1986 that his understanding was that when &quot;DC have not used the characters for a year, they&#x27;re ours.&quot; Both Moore and Gibbons said DC paid them &quot;a substantial amount of money&quot; to retain the rights. Moore added, &quot;So basically they&#x27;re not ours, but if DC is working with the characters in our interests then they might as well be. On the other hand, if the characters have outlived their natural life span and DC doesn&#x27;t want to do anything with them, then after a year we&#x27;ve got them and we can do what we want with them, which I&#x27;m perfectly happy with.&quot;

Moore said he left DC in 1989 due to the language in his contracts for &quot;Watchmen&quot; and his &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; series with artist David Lloyd. Moore felt the reversion clauses were ultimately meaningless because DC did not intend to let the publications go out of print. He told &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2006, &quot;I said, &#x27;Fair enough ... You have managed to successfully swindle me, and so I will never work for you again. In 2000, Moore publicly distanced himself from DC&#x27;s plans for a 15th anniversary &quot;Watchmen&quot; hardcover release as well as a proposed line of action figures from DC Direct. While DC wanted to mend its relationship with the writer, Moore felt the company was not treating him fairly in regard to his America&#x27;s Best Comics imprint (launched under the WildStorm comic imprint, which was bought by DC in 1998; Moore was promised no direct interference by DC as part of the arrangement). Moore added, &quot;As far as I&#x27;m concerned, the 15th anniversary of &quot;Watchmen&quot; is purely a 15th Anniversary of when DC managed to take the &quot;Watchmen&quot; property from me and Dave [Gibbons].&quot; Soon afterward, DC Direct canceled the &quot;Watchmen&quot; action-figure line, despite the company having displayed prototypes at the 2000 San Diego Comic-Con.

==Prequel projects==

Moore stated in 1985 that if the limited series was well-received, he and Gibbons would possibly create a 12-issue prequel series called &quot;Minutemen&quot; featuring the 1940s superhero group from the story. DC offered Moore and Gibbons chances to publish prequels to the series, such as &quot;Rorschach&#x27;s Journal&quot; or &quot;The Comedian&#x27;s Vietnam War Diary&quot;, as well as hinting at the possibility of other authors using the same universe. Tales of the Comedian&#x27;s Vietnam War experiences were floated because &quot;The &#x27;Nam&quot; was popular at the time, while another suggestion was, according to Gibbons, for a &quot;Nite Owl/Rorschach team&quot; (in the manner of &quot;Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)&quot;). Neither man felt the stories would have gone anywhere, with Moore particularly adamant that DC not go forward with stories by other individuals. Gibbons was more attracted to the idea of a &quot;Minutemen&quot; series because it would have &quot;[paid] homage to the simplicity and unsophisticated nature of Golden Age comic books—with the added dramatic interest that it would be a story whose conclusion is already known. It would be, perhaps, interesting to see how we got to the conclusion.&quot;

In 2010, Moore told &quot;Wired&quot; that DC offered him the rights to &quot;Watchmen&quot; back if he would agree to prequel and sequel projects. Moore said that &quot;if they said that 10 years ago, when I asked them for that, then yeah it might have worked [...] But these days I don&#x27;t want &quot;Watchmen&quot; back. Certainly, I don&#x27;t want it back under those kinds of terms.&quot; DC Comics co-publishers Dan DiDio and Jim Lee responded: &quot;DC Comics would only revisit these iconic characters if the creative vision of any proposed new stories matched the quality set by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons nearly 25 years ago, and our first discussion on any of this would naturally be with the creators themselves.&quot; Following months of rumors about a potential &quot;Watchmen&quot; follow-up project, in February 2012 DC announced it was publishing seven prequel series under the &quot;Before Watchmen&quot; banner. Among the creators involved were writers J. Michael Straczynski, Brian Azzarello, Darwyn Cooke, and Len Wein, and artists Lee Bermejo, J. G. Jones, Adam Hughes, Andy Kubert, Joe Kubert, and Amanda Conner. Though Moore had no involvement with &quot;Before Watchmen&quot;, Gibbons supplied the project with a statement in the initial press announcement:
==Sequels==
===Comic book sequel: &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;===

The sequel to &quot;Watchmen&quot;, entitled &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, is part of the DC Rebirth line of comics, additionally continuing a narrative established with 2016&#x27;s one-shot &quot;DC Universe: Rebirth Special&quot; and 2017&#x27;s crossover &quot;The Button&quot;, both of which featured Doctor Manhattan in a minor capacity. The miniseries, taking place seven years after the events of &quot;Watchmen&quot; in November 1992, follows Ozymandias as he attempts to locate Doctor Manhattan alongside Reginald Long, the successor of Walter Kovacs as Rorschach, following the exposure and subsequent failure of his plan for peace and the subsequent impending nuclear war between the United States and Russia. The series was revealed on May 14, 2017, with a teaser image displaying the Superman logo in the 12 o&#x27;clock slot of the clock depicted in &quot;Watchmen&quot; and the series title in the bold typeface used for &quot;Watchmen&quot;. The first of a planned twelve issues was released on November 22, 2017.

The story includes many DC characters but has a particular focus on Superman and Doctor Manhattan, despite Superman stated as being a fictional character in the original series—the series uses the plot element of the multiverse. Writer Geoff Johns felt like there was an interesting story to be told in Rebirth with Doctor Manhattan. He thought there was an interesting dichotomy between Superman—an alien who embodies and is compassionate for humanity—and Doctor Manhattan—a human who has detached himself from humanity. This led to over six months of debates among the creative team about whether to intersect the &quot;Watchmen&quot; universe with the DC Universe, through the plot element of alternate realities. He explained that &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot; was the &quot;most personal and most epic, utterly mind-bending project&quot; that he had worked on in his career.

===Television series sequel===

HBO brought on Damon Lindelof to develop a &quot;Watchmen&quot; television show, which premiered on October 20, 2019. Lindelof, a fan of the limited series, made the show a &quot;remix&quot; of the comic, narratively a sequel while introducing a new set of characters and story that he felt made the work unique enough without being a full reboot of the comic series. Among its main cast are Regina King, Don Johnson, Tim Blake Nelson, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, and Jeremy Irons. The television show takes place in 2019, 34 years after the end of the limited series, and is primarily set in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Due to liberal policies set by President Robert Redford to provide reparations to those affected by racial violence, white supremacist groups (following the writings of Rorschach) attack the police who enforce these policies, leading to laws requiring police to hide their identity and wear masks. This has allowed new masked crime fighters to assist the police against the supremacists. Doctor Manhattan, Adrian Veidt / Ozymandias, and Laurie Blake / Silk Spectre are central characters to the show&#x27;s plot.

==Adaptations==
===Film adaptation===
There have been numerous attempts to make a film version of &quot;Watchmen&quot; since 1986, when producers Lawrence Gordon and Joel Silver acquired film rights to the series for 20th Century Fox. Fox asked Alan Moore to write a screenplay based on his story, but he declined, so the studio enlisted screenwriter Sam Hamm. Hamm took the liberty of re-writing &quot;Watchmen&quot;″s complicated ending into a &quot;more manageable&quot; conclusion involving an assassination and a time paradox. Fox put the project into turnaround in 1991, and the project was moved to Warner Bros. Pictures, where Terry Gilliam was attached to direct and Charles McKeown to rewrite it. They used the character Rorschach&#x27;s diary as a voice-over and restored scenes from the comic book that Hamm had removed. Gilliam and Silver were only able to raise $25 million for the film (a quarter of the necessary budget) because their previous films had gone over budget. Gilliam abandoned the project because he decided that &quot;Watchmen&quot; would have been unfilmable. &quot;Reducing [the story] to a two or two-and-a-half hour film [...] seemed to me to take away the essence of what &quot;Watchmen&quot; is about,&quot; he said. After Warner Bros. dropped the project, Gordon invited Gilliam back to helm the film independently. The director again declined, believing that the comic book would be better directed as a five-hour miniseries.
In October 2001, Gordon partnered with Lloyd Levin and Universal Studios, hiring David Hayter to write and direct. Hayter and the producers left Universal due to creative differences, and Gordon and Levin expressed interest in setting up &quot;Watchmen&quot; at Revolution Studios. The project did not hold together at Revolution Studios and subsequently fell apart. In July 2004, it was announced Paramount Pictures would produce &quot;Watchmen&quot;, and they attached Darren Aronofsky to direct Hayter&#x27;s script. Producers Gordon and Levin remained attached, collaborating with Aronofsky&#x27;s producing partner, Eric Watson. Aronofsky left to focus on &quot;The Fountain&quot; and was replaced by Paul Greengrass. Ultimately, Paramount placed &quot;Watchmen&quot; in turnaround.

In October 2005, Gordon and Levin met with Warner Bros. to develop the film there again. Impressed with Zack Snyder&#x27;s work on &quot;300&quot;, Warner Bros. approached him to direct an adaptation of &quot;Watchmen&quot;. Screenwriter Alex Tse drew from his favorite elements of Hayter&#x27;s script, but also returned it to the original Cold War setting of the &quot;Watchmen&quot; comic. Similar to his approach to &quot;300&quot;, Snyder used the comic book panel-grid as a storyboard and opted to shoot the entire film using live-action sets instead of green screens. He extended the fight scenes, and added a subplot about energy resources to make the film more topical. Although he intended to stay faithful to the look of the characters in the comic, Snyder intended Nite Owl to look scarier, and made Ozymandias&#x27; armor into a parody of the rubber muscle suits from the 1997 superhero film &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;. After the trailer to the film premiered in July 2008, DC Comics president Paul Levitz said that the company had to print more than 900,000 copies of &quot;Watchmen&quot; trade collection to meet the additional demand for the book that the advertising campaign had generated, with the total annual print run expected to be over one million copies. While 20th Century Fox filed a lawsuit to block the film&#x27;s release, the studios eventually settled, with Warner agreeing to give Fox 8.5 percent of the film&#x27;s worldwide gross, including from sequels and spin-offs in return. The film was released to theaters in March 2009 to mixed reviews and grossed $185 million worldwide.

&quot;Tales of the Black Freighter&quot; was adapted as a direct-to-video animated feature from Warner Premiere and Warner Bros. Animation, which was released on March 24, 2009. It was originally included in the screenplay for the &quot;Watchmen&quot; film, but was cut due to budget restrictions, as the segment would have added $20 million to the budget, because Snyder wanted to film it in a stylized manner reminiscent of &quot;300&quot;. Gerard Butler, who starred in &quot;300&quot;, voices the Captain in the film, having been promised a role in &quot;Watchmen&quot; that never materialized.
Jared Harris voices his deceased friend Ridley, whom the Captain hallucinates is talking to him. Snyder had Butler and Harris record their parts together. Snyder considered including the animated film in the final cut, but the film was already approaching a three-hour running time. The &quot;Tales of the Black Freighter&quot; was given standalone DVD release which also includes &quot;Under the Hood&quot;, a documentary detailing the characters&#x27; backstories, named after the character Hollis Mason&#x27;s (the first Nite Owl) memoirs. The film itself was released on DVD four months after &quot;Tales of the Black Freighter&quot;, and in November 2009, a four-disc set was released as the &quot;Ultimate Cut&quot; with the animated film edited back into the main picture. The director&#x27;s cut and the extended version of &quot;Watchmen&quot; both include &quot;Tales of the Black Freighter&quot; on their DVD releases.

Len Wein, the comic&#x27;s editor, wrote a video game prequel entitled &quot;&quot;.

Dave Gibbons became an adviser on Snyder&#x27;s film, but Moore has refused to have his name attached to any film adaptations of his work. Moore has stated he has no interest in seeing Snyder&#x27;s adaptation; he told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in 2008 that &quot;[t]here are things that we did with &quot;Watchmen&quot; that could only work in a comic, and were indeed designed to show off things that other media can&#x27;t&quot;. While Moore believes that David Hayter&#x27;s screenplay was &quot;as close as I could imagine anyone getting to &quot;Watchmen&quot;&quot;, he asserted he did not intend to see the film if it were made.

===Motion comic===

In 2008, Warner Bros. Entertainment released &quot;Watchmen Motion Comics&quot;, a series of narrated animations of the original comic book. The first chapter was released for purchase in the summer of 2008 on digital video stores, such as iTunes Store. A DVD compiling the full motion comic series was released in March 2009.

===Animated film===
Warner Bros. announced in April 2017 that they would develop an R-rated animated film based on the comic book. A teaser trailer was released on June 13, 2024, and revealed it to be a two-part film.

&quot;Watchmen Chapter I&quot; received a digital release on August 13, 2024, and Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD release on August 27, 2024, &quot;Watchmen Chapter II&quot; released on November 26, 2024.

===Arrowverse===
The HBO version of the &quot;Watchmen&quot; was referenced in the Arrowverse&#x27;s &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; crossover. A sign could be seen on a building on Earth-666 advertising the show at the time when John Constantine, John Diggle, and Mia Smoak arrive on Earth-666 to enlist Lucifer&#x27;s help in entering Purgatory so that they can retrieve Oliver Queen&#x27;s soul.

==Legacy==
A critical and commercial success, &quot;Watchmen&quot; is highly regarded in the comics industry and is frequently considered by several critics and reviewers as comics&#x27; greatest series and graphic novel. In addition to being one of the first major works to help popularize the graphic novel publishing format alongside &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, &quot;Watchmen&quot; has also become one of the best-selling graphic novels ever published. &quot;Watchmen&quot; was the only graphic novel to appear on &quot;Time&quot;″s 2005 &quot;All-&quot;Time&quot; 100 Greatest Novels&quot; list, where &quot;Time&quot; critic Lev Grossman described the story as &quot;a heart-pounding, heartbreaking read and a watershed in the evolution of a young medium.&quot; It later appeared on &quot;Time&quot;″s 2009 &quot;Top 10 Graphic Novels&quot; list, where Grossman further praised &quot;Watchmen&quot;, proclaiming &quot;It&#x27;s way beyond cliché at this point to call &quot;Watchmen&quot; the greatest superhero comic ever written-slash-drawn. But it&#x27;s true.&quot; In 2008, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; placed &quot;Watchmen&quot; at number 13 on its list of the best 50 novels printed in the last 25 years, describing it as &quot;The greatest superhero story ever told and proof that comics are capable of smart, emotionally resonant narratives worthy of the label &#x27;literature&#x27;.&quot; &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;, however, ranked &quot;Watchmen&quot; at number 91 on its list of the Top 100 English-language comics of the 20th century.

In &quot;Art of the Comic Book: An Aesthetic History&quot;, Robert Harvey wrote that, with &quot;Watchmen&quot;, Moore and Gibbons &quot;had demonstrated as never before the capacity of the [comic book] medium to tell a sophisticated story that could be engineered only in comics&quot;. In his review of the Absolute Edition of the collection, Dave Itzkoff of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the dark legacy of &quot;Watchmen&quot;, &quot;one that Moore almost certainly never intended, whose DNA is encoded in the increasingly black inks and bleak storylines that have become the essential elements of the contemporary superhero comic book,&quot; is &quot;a domain he has largely ceded to writers and artists who share his fascination with brutality but not his interest in its consequences, his eagerness to tear down old boundaries but not his drive to find new ones.&quot; Alan Moore himself said his intentions with works like &quot;Marvelman&quot; and &quot;Watchmen&quot; were to liberate comics and open them up to new and fresh ideas, thus creating more diversity in the comics world by showing the industry what could be done with already existing concepts. Instead it had the opposite effect, confining the superhero comic to a &quot;depressive ghetto of grimness and psychosis&quot;. In 2009, Lydia Millet of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; contested that &quot;Watchmen&quot; was worthy of such acclaim, and wrote that while the series&#x27; &quot;vividly drawn panels, moody colors and lush imagery make its popularity well-deserved, if disproportionate&quot;, that &quot;it&#x27;s simply bizarre to assert that, as an illustrated literary narrative, it rivals in artistic merit, say, masterpieces like Chris Ware&#x27;s &#x27;Acme Novelty Library&#x27; or almost any part of the witty and brilliant work of Edward Gorey&quot;.

&quot;Watchmen&quot; was one of the two comic books, alongside &quot;Batman: The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, that inspired designer Vincent Connare when he created the Comic Sans font.

In 2009, Brain Scan Studios released the parody &quot;Watchmensch&quot;, a comic in which writer Rich Johnston chronicled &quot;the debate surrounding &quot;Watchmen&quot;, the original contracts, the current legal suits over the Fox contract&quot;.

Also in 2009, to coincide with the release of the &quot;Watchmen&quot; movie, IDW Publishing produced a parody one-shot comic titled &quot;Whatmen?!&quot;

Grant Morrison wrote a scene in &quot;Pax Americana&quot; (2014) where a child shoots his father in the head with his own gun, killing him. This was meant to symbolize Morrison&#x27;s opinion about how the limited series had a negative impact on the superhero genre: &quot;it&#x27;s Watchmen&#x27;s shot to the head of the American superhero.&quot;

In September 2016, Hasslein Books published &quot;Watching Time: The Unauthorized Watchmen Chronology&quot;, by author Rich Handley. The book provides a detailed history of the &quot;Watchmen&quot; franchise.

In December 2017, DC Entertainment published &quot;Watchmen: Annotated&quot;, a fully annotated black-and-white edition of the graphic novel, edited, with an introduction and notes by Leslie S. Klinger (who previously annotated Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman&quot; for DC). The edition contains extensive materials from Alan Moore&#x27;s original scripts and was written with the full collaboration of Dave Gibbons.

<text>Wassily Wassilyevich Kandinsky ( – 13 December 1944) was a Russian painter and art theorist. Kandinsky is generally credited as one of the pioneers of abstraction in western art. Born in Moscow, he spent his childhood in Odessa, where he graduated from Odessa Art School. He enrolled at the University of Moscow, studying law and economics. Successful in his profession, he was offered a professorship (chair of Roman Law) at the University of Dorpat (today Tartu, Estonia). Kandinsky began painting studies (life-drawing, sketching and anatomy) at the age of 30.

In 1896, Kandinsky settled in Munich, studying first at Anton Ažbe&#x27;s private school and then at the Academy of Fine Arts. He returned to Moscow in 1914 after the outbreak of World War I. Following the Russian Revolution, Kandinsky &quot;became an insider in the cultural administration of Anatoly Lunacharsky&quot; and helped establish the Museum of the Culture of Painting. However, by then, &quot;his spiritual outlook... was foreign to the argumentative materialism of Soviet society&quot; and opportunities beckoned in Germany, to which he returned in 1920. There, he taught at the Bauhaus school of art and architecture from 1922 until the Nazis closed it in 1933. He then moved to France, where he lived for the rest of his life, becoming a French citizen in 1939 and producing some of his most prominent art. He died in Neuilly-sur-Seine in 1944.

==Early life==
Kandinsky was born in Moscow, the son of Lidia Ticheeva and Vasily Silvestrovich Kandinsky, a tea merchant. One of his great-grandmothers was Princess Gantimurova. Kandinsky learned from a variety of sources while in Moscow. He studied many fields while in school, including law and economics. Later in life, he would recall being fascinated and stimulated by colour as a child. His fascination with colour symbolism and psychology continued as he grew.

In 1889, at age 23, he was part of an ethnographic research group that travelled to the Vologda region north of Moscow. In &quot;Looks on the Past&quot;, he relates that the houses and churches were decorated with such shimmering colours that upon entering them, he felt that he was moving into a painting. This experience, as well as his study of the region&#x27;s folk art (particularly the use of bright colours on a dark background), were reflected in much of his early work.

A few years later, he first likened painting to composing music in the manner for which he would become noted, writing &quot;Colour is the keyboard, the eyes are the harmony, the soul is the piano with many strings. The artist is the hand which plays, touching one key or another, to cause vibrations in the soul&quot;.

Kandinsky was also the uncle of Russian-French philosopher Alexandre Kojève (1902–1968).

== Artistic periods ==
Kandinsky&#x27;s creation of abstract work followed a long period of development and maturation of intense thought based on his artistic experiences. He called this devotion to inner beauty, fervor of spirit and spiritual desire &quot;inner necessity&quot;; it was a central aspect of his art. Some art historians suggest that Kandinsky&#x27;s passion for abstract art began when one day, coming back home, he found one of his own paintings hanging upside down in his studio and he stared at it for a while before realizing it was his own work, suggesting to him the potential power of abstraction.

In 1896, at the age of 30, Kandinsky gave up a promising career teaching law and economics to enroll in the Munich Academy where his teachers would eventually include Franz von Stuck. He was not immediately granted admission and began learning art on his own. That same year, before leaving Moscow, he saw an exhibit of paintings by Monet. He was particularly taken with the impressionistic style of &quot;Haystacks&quot;; this, to him, had a powerful sense of colour almost independent of the objects themselves. Later, he would write about this experience:

Kandinsky was similarly influenced during this period by Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot; which, he felt, pushed the limits of music and melody beyond standard lyricism. He was also spiritually influenced by Madame Blavatsky (1831–1891), the best-known exponent of theosophy. Theosophical theory postulates that creation is a geometrical progression, beginning with a single point. The creative aspect of the form is expressed by a descending series of circles, triangles, and squares. Kandinsky&#x27;s book &quot;Concerning the Spiritual in Art&quot; (1910) and &quot;Point and Line to Plane&quot; (1926) echoed this theosophical tenet. Illustrations by John Varley in &quot;Thought-Forms&quot; (1901) influenced him visually.

=== Metamorphosis ===
In the summer of 1902, Kandinsky invited Gabriele Münter to join him at his summer painting classes just south of Munich in the Alps. She accepted the offer and their relationship became more personal than professional.
Art school, usually considered difficult, was easy for Kandinsky. It was during this time that he began to emerge as an art theorist as well as a painter. The number of his existing paintings increased at the beginning of the 20th century; much remains of the landscapes and towns he painted, using broad swaths of colour and recognisable forms. For the most part, however, Kandinsky&#x27;s paintings did not feature any human figures; an exception is &quot;Sunday, Old Russia&quot; (1904), in which Kandinsky recreates a highly colourful (and fanciful) view of peasants and nobles in front of the walls of a town. &quot;Couple on Horseback&quot; (1907) depicts a man on horseback, holding a woman as they ride past a Russian town with luminous walls across a blue river. The horse is muted while the leaves in the trees, the town, and the reflections in the river glisten with spots of colour and brightness. This work demonstrates the influence of pointillism in the way the depth of field is collapsed into a flat, luminescent surface. Fauvism is also apparent in these early works. Colours are used to express Kandinsky&#x27;s experience of subject matter, not to describe objective nature.

Perhaps the most important of his paintings from the first decade of the 1900s was &quot;The Blue Rider&quot; (1903), which shows a small cloaked figure on a speeding horse rushing through a rocky meadow. The rider&#x27;s cloak is medium blue, which casts a darker-blue shadow. In the foreground are more amorphous blue shadows, the counterparts of the fall trees in the background. The blue rider in the painting is prominent (but not clearly defined), and the horse has an unnatural gait (which Kandinsky must have known) . This intentional disjunction, allowing viewers to participate in the creation of the artwork, became an increasingly conscious technique used by Kandinsky in subsequent years; it culminated in the abstract works of the 1911–1914 period. In &quot;The Blue Rider&quot;, Kandinsky shows the rider more as a series of colours than in specific detail. This painting is not exceptional in that regard when compared with contemporary painters, but it shows the direction Kandinsky would take only a few years later.

From 1906 to 1908, Kandinsky spent a great deal of time travelling across Europe (he was an associate of the Blue Rose symbolist group of Moscow) until he settled in the small Bavarian town of Murnau. In 1908, he bought a copy of &quot;Thought-Forms&quot; by Annie Besant and Charles Webster Leadbeater. In 1909, he joined the Theosophical Society. &quot;The Blue Mountain&quot; (1908–1909) was painted at this time, demonstrating his trend toward abstraction. A mountain of blue is flanked by two broad trees, one yellow and one red. A procession, with three riders and several others, crosses at the bottom. The faces, clothing, and saddles of the riders are each a single color, and neither they nor the walking figures display any real detail. The flat planes and the contours also are indicative of Fauvist influence. The broad use of color in &quot;The Blue Mountain&quot; illustrates Kandinsky&#x27;s inclination toward an art in which colour is presented independently of form, and in which each color is given equal attention. The composition is more planar; the painting is divided into four sections: the sky, the red tree, the yellow tree, and the blue mountain with the three riders.

=== Blue Rider Period (1911–1914) ===

Kandinsky&#x27;s paintings from this period are large, expressive coloured masses evaluated independently from forms and lines; these serve no longer to delimit them, but overlap freely to form paintings of extraordinary force. Music was important to the birth of abstract art since it is abstract by nature; it does not try to represent the exterior world, but expresses the inner feelings of the soul in an immediate way. Kandinsky sometimes used musical terms to identify his works; he called his most spontaneous paintings &quot;improvisations&quot; and described more elaborate works as &quot;compositions.&quot;

In addition to painting, Kandinsky was an art theorist; his influence on the history of Western art stems perhaps more from his theoretical works than from his paintings. He helped found the Neue Künstlervereinigung München (Munich New Artists&#x27; Association), becoming its president in 1909. However, the group could not integrate the radical approach of Kandinsky (and others) with conventional artistic concepts and the group dissolved in late 1911. Kandinsky then formed a new group, &quot;The Blue Rider&quot; (&quot;Der Blaue Reiter&quot;) with like-minded artists such as August Macke, Franz Marc, Albert Bloch, and Gabriele Münter. The group released an almanac (&quot;The Blue Rider Almanac&quot;) and held two exhibits. More of each were planned, but the outbreak of World War I in 1914 ended these plans and sent Kandinsky back to Russia via Switzerland and Sweden.

His writing in &quot;The Blue Rider Almanac&quot; and the treatise &quot;On the Spiritual in Art&quot; (which was released in 1910) were both a defence and promotion of abstract art and an affirmation that all forms of art were equally capable of reaching a level of spirituality. He believed that colour could be used in a painting as something autonomous, apart from the visual description of an object or other form.

These ideas had an almost-immediate international impact, particularly in the English-speaking world. As early as 1912, &quot;On the Spiritual in Art&quot; was reviewed by Michael Sadleir in the London-based &quot;Art News.&quot; Interest in Kandinsky grew quickly when Sadleir published an English translation of &quot;On the Spiritual in Art&quot; in 1914. Extracts from the book were published that year in Percy Wyndham Lewis&#x27;s periodical &quot;Blast,&quot; and Alfred Orage&#x27;s weekly cultural newspaper &quot;The New Age&quot;. Kandinsky had received some notice earlier in Britain, however; in 1910, he participated in the Allied Artists&#x27; Exhibition (organised by Frank Rutter) at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall. This resulted in his work being singled out for praise in a review of that show by the artist Spencer Frederick Gore in &quot;The Art News&quot;.

Sadleir&#x27;s interest in Kandinsky also led to Kandinsky&#x27;s first works entering a British art collection; Sadleir&#x27;s father, Michael Sadler, acquired several wood-prints and the abstract painting &quot;Fragment for Composition VII&quot; in 1913 following a visit by father and son to meet Kandinsky in Munich that year. These works were displayed in Leeds, either in the university or the premises of the Leeds Arts Club, between 1913 and 1923.

=== Return to Russia (1914–1921) ===

From 1918 to 1921, Kandinsky was involved in the cultural politics of Russia and collaborated in art education and museum reform. He painted little during this period, but devoted his time to artistic teaching with a program based on form and colour analysis; he also helped organize the Institute of Artistic Culture in Moscow (of which he was its first director). His spiritual, expressionistic view of art was ultimately rejected by the radical members of the institute as too individualistic and bourgeois. In 1921, Kandinsky was invited to go to Germany to attend the Bauhaus of Weimar by its founder, architect Walter Gropius.

=== Back in Germany and the Bauhaus (1922–1933) ===
In May 1922, he attended the International Congress of Progressive Artists and signed the &quot;Founding Proclamation of the Union of Progressive International Artists&quot;.

Kandinsky taught the basic design class for beginners and the course on advanced theory at the Bauhaus; he also conducted painting classes and a workshop in which he augmented his colour theory with new elements of form psychology. The development of his works on forms study, particularly on points and line forms, led to the publication of his second theoretical book (&quot;Point and Line to Plane&quot;) in 1926. His examinations of the effects of forces on straight lines, leading to the contrasting tones of curved and angled lines, coincided with the research of Gestalt psychologists, whose work was also discussed at the Bauhaus. Geometrical elements took on increasing importance in both his teaching and painting—particularly the circle, half-circle, the angle, straight lines and curves. This period was intensely productive. This freedom is characterised in his works by the treatment of planes rich in colours and gradations—as in &quot;Yellow – red – blue&quot; (1925), where Kandinsky illustrates his distance from the constructivism and suprematism movements influential at the time.
The &quot;Yellow – red – blue&quot; (1925) of several main forms: a vertical yellow rectangle, an inclined red cross and a large dark blue circle; a multitude of straight (or sinuous) black lines, circular arcs, monochromatic circles and scattered, coloured checker-boards contribute to its delicate complexity. This simple visual identification of forms and the main coloured masses present on the canvas is only a first approach to the inner reality of the work, whose appreciation necessitates deeper observation—not only of forms and colours involved in the painting but their relationship, their absolute and relative positions on the canvas and their harmony.

Kandinsky was one of &quot;Die Blaue Vier&quot; (&quot;The Blue Four&quot;), which was a group that was formed in 1923 with Paul Klee, Lyonel Feininger and Alexej von Jawlensky at the instigation of Galka Scheyer, who promoted their work in the United States from 1924 onward. Due to right-wing hostility, the Bauhaus left Weimar for Dessau in 1925. Following a Nazi smear campaign, the Bauhaus left Dessau in 1932 for Berlin, where it remained until its dissolution in July 1933. Kandinsky then left Germany, settling in Paris.

=== Great Synthesis (1934–1944) ===

Living in an apartment in Paris, Kandinsky created his work in a living-room studio. Biomorphic forms with supple, non-geometric outlines appear in his paintings—forms which suggest microscopic organisms but express the artist&#x27;s inner life. Kandinsky used original colour compositions, evoking Slavic popular art. He also occasionally mixed sand with paint to give a granular, rustic texture to his paintings.

This period corresponds to a synthesis of Kandinsky&#x27;s previous work in which he used all elements, enriching them. In 1936 and 1939, he painted his final two major compositions, the type of elaborate canvases he had not produced for many years. &quot;Composition IX&quot; has highly contrasted, powerful diagonals whose central form gives the impression of an embryo in the womb. Small squares of colours and coloured bands stand out against the black background of &quot;Composition X&quot; as star fragments (or filaments), while enigmatic hieroglyphs with pastel tones cover a large maroon mass which seems to float in the upper-left corner of the canvas. In Kandinsky&#x27;s work, some characteristics are obvious, while certain touches are more discreet and veiled; they reveal themselves only progressively to those who deepen their connection with his work. He intended his forms (which he subtly harmonised and placed) to resonate with the observer&#x27;s soul.

== Kandinsky&#x27;s conception of art ==
=== The artist as prophet ===

Writing that &quot;music is the ultimate teacher&quot;, Kandinsky embarked upon the first seven of his ten &quot;Compositions&quot;. The first three survive only in black-and-white photographs taken by fellow artist and friend Gabriele Münter. &quot;Composition I&quot; (1910) was destroyed by a British air raid on the city of Braunschweig in Lower Saxony on the night of 14 October 1944.

While studies, sketches, and improvisations exist (particularly of &quot;Composition II&quot;), a Nazi raid on the Bauhaus in the 1930s resulted in the confiscation of Kandinsky&#x27;s first three &quot;Compositions&quot;. They were displayed in the state-sponsored Degenerate Art exhibition and were then destroyed (along with works by Paul Klee, Franz Marc and other modern artists).

Fascinated by Christian eschatology and the perception of a coming New Age, a common theme among Kandinsky&#x27;s first seven &quot;Compositions&quot; is the apocalypse (the end of the world as we know it). Writing of the &quot;artist as prophet&quot; in his book, &quot;Concerning the Spiritual in Art&quot;, Kandinsky created paintings in the years immediately preceding World War I showing a coming cataclysm which would alter individual and social reality. Having a devout belief in Orthodox Christianity, Kandinsky drew upon the biblical stories of Noah&#x27;s Ark, Jonah and the whale, Christ&#x27;s resurrection, the four horsemen of the Apocalypse in the book of Revelation, Russian folktales and the common mythological experiences of death and rebirth. Never attempting to picture any one of these stories as a narrative, he used their veiled imagery as symbols of the archetypes of death–rebirth and destruction–creation he felt were imminent in the pre-World War I world.

As he stated in &quot;Concerning the Spiritual in Art&quot; (see below), Kandinsky felt that an authentic artist creating art from &quot;an internal necessity&quot; inhabits the tip of an upward-moving pyramid. This progressing pyramid is penetrating and proceeding into the future. What was odd or inconceivable yesterday is commonplace today; what is &quot;avant garde&quot; today (and understood only by the few) is common knowledge tomorrow. The modern artist–prophet stands alone at the apex of the pyramid, making new discoveries and ushering in tomorrow&#x27;s reality. Kandinsky was aware of recent scientific developments and the advances of modern artists who had contributed to radically new ways of seeing and experiencing the world.

&quot;Composition IV&quot; and later paintings are primarily concerned with evoking a spiritual resonance in viewer and artist. As in his painting of the apocalypse by water (&quot;Composition VI&quot;), Kandinsky puts the viewer in the situation of experiencing these epic myths by translating them into contemporary terms (with a sense of desperation, flurry, urgency, and confusion). This spiritual communion of viewer-painting-artist/prophet may be described within the limits of words and images.

=== Artistic and spiritual theorist ===

As the &quot;Der Blaue Reiter Almanac&quot; essays and theorising with composer Arnold Schoenberg indicate, Kandinsky also expressed the communion between artist and viewer as being available to both the senses and the mind (synesthesia). Hearing tones and chords as he painted, Kandinsky theorised that (for example), yellow is the colour of middle C on a brassy trumpet; black is the colour of closure, and the end of things; and that combinations of colours produce vibrational frequencies, akin to chords played on a piano. In 1871 the young Kandinsky learned to play the piano and cello.

Kandinsky also developed a theory of geometric figures and their relationships, claiming (for example) that the circle is the most peaceful shape and represents the human soul. These theories are explained in &quot;Point and Line to Plane&quot;.

Kandinsky&#x27;s legendary stage design for a performance of Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; illustrates his synesthetic concept of a universal correspondence of forms, colors and musical sounds. In 1928, the stage production premiered at a theater in Dessau. In 2015, the original designs of the stage elements were animated with modern video technology and synchronized with the music according to the preparatory notes of Kandinsky and the director&#x27;s script of Felix Klee.

In another episode with Münter during the Bavarian abstract expressionist years, Kandinsky was working on &quot;Composition VI&quot;. From nearly six months of study and preparation, he had intended the work to evoke a flood, baptism, destruction, and rebirth simultaneously. After outlining the work on a mural-sized wood panel, he became blocked and could not go on. Münter told him that he was trapped in his intellect and not reaching the true subject of the picture. She suggested he simply repeat the word &quot;uberflut&quot; (&quot;deluge&quot; or &quot;flood&quot;) and focus on its sound rather than its meaning. Repeating this word like a mantra, Kandinsky painted and completed the monumental work in a three-day span.

== Signature style ==

Wassily Kandinsky&#x27;s art has a confluence of music and spirituality. With his appreciation for music of his times and kinesthetic disposition, Kandinsky&#x27;s artworks have a marked style of expressionism in his early years. But he embraced all types of artistic styles of his times and his predecessors i.e. Art Nouveau (sinuous organic forms), Fauvism and Blaue Reiter (shocking colours), Surrealism (mystery) and Bauhaus (constructivism) only to move towards abstractionism as he explored spirituality in art. His object-free paintings display spiritual abstraction suggested by sounds and emotions through a unity of sensation. Driven by the Christian faith and the inner necessity of an artist, his paintings have the ambiguity of the form rendered in a variety of colours as well as resistance against conventional aesthetic values of the art world.

His signature or individual style can be further defined and divided into three categories over the course of his art career: Impressions (representational element), Improvisations (spontaneous emotional reaction) and Compositions (ultimate works of art).

As Kandinsky started moving away from his early inspiration from Impressionism, his paintings became more vibrant, pictographic and expressive with more sharp shapes and clear linear qualities.

But eventually, Kandinsky went further, rejecting pictorial representation with more synesthetic swirling hurricanes of colours and shapes, eliminating traditional references to depth and laying out bare and abstracted glyphs; however, what remained consistent was his spiritual pursuit of expressive forms.

Emotional harmony is another salient feature in the later works of Kandinsky. With diverse dimensions and bright hues balanced through a careful juxtaposition of proportion and colours, he substantiated the universality of shapes in his artworks thus paving the way for further abstraction.

Kandinsky often used black in his paintings to heighten the impact of brightly coloured forms while his forms were often biomorphic approaches to bring surrealism in his art.

== Theoretical writings on art ==
Kandinsky&#x27;s analyses on forms and colours result not from simple, arbitrary idea-associations but from the painter&#x27;s inner experience. He spent years creating abstract/sensorially rich paintings, working with form and colour, tirelessly observing his own paintings (along with those of other artists) and noting their effects on his sense of colour. This subjective experience is something that anyone can do—not scientific/objective observations, but inner/subjective ones, referred to by French philosopher Michel Henry as &quot;absolute subjectivity&quot; or the &quot;absolute phenomenological life&quot;.

Published in Munich in 1911, Kandinsky&#x27;s text &quot;Über das Geistige in der Kunst&quot; (&quot;Concerning the spiritual in art&quot;) defines three types of painting: &quot;impressions&quot;, &quot;improvisations&quot; and &quot;compositions&quot;. While impressions are based on an external reality that serves as a starting point, improvisations and compositions depict images emergent from the unconscious, though &quot;composition&quot; is developed from a more formal point of view.

==Personal life==
After graduating in 1892, Kandinsky married his cousin, Anja Chimiakina, and became a lecturer in Jurisprudence at the University of Moscow.

In the summer of 1902, Kandinsky invited Gabriele Münter to join him at his summer painting classes just south of Munich in the Alps. She accepted the offer and their relationship became more personal than professional. In 1911, the German expressionist painter was one of several artists joining Kandinsky in his &quot;Blue Rider&quot; (&quot;Der Blaue Reiter&quot;) group, which ended with the onset of World War I.

Kandinsky and Münter became engaged in the summer of 1903 while he was still married to Anja and travelled extensively through Europe, Russia and North Africa until 1908. He separated from Anja in 1911.

From 1906 to 1908, Kandinsky travelled across Europe. In 1909, Münter bought a summerhouse in the small Bavarian town of Murnau and the couple happily entertained colleagues there. The property is still known as Russenhaus and she would later use the basement to hide many works (by Kandinsky and others) from the Nazis. Upon returning to Munich, Kandinsky founded the Neue Kunstler Vereinigung (New Artists&#x27; Association) in 1909.

He returned to Moscow in 1914 when the first World War broke out. The relationship between Kandinsky and Münter worsened due to mutual tensions and disappointments over his lack of commitment to marriage. Their relationship formally ended in 1916 in Stockholm.

In 1916, he met Nina Nikolaevna Andreevskaya (1899–1980), whom he married on 11 February 1917 when she was 17 or 18 and he was 50 years old. At the end of 1917, they had a son, Wsevolod, or Lodya as he was called in the family. Lodya died in June 1920 and there were no more children.

After the Russian Revolution, he had opportunities in Germany, to which he returned in 1920. There, he taught at the Bauhaus school of art and architecture from 1922 until the Nazis closed it in 1933.

He then moved to France with his wife, where he lived for the rest of his life, becoming a French citizen in 1939 and producing some of his most prominent art.

He died in Neuilly-sur-Seine on 13 December 1944.

== Art market ==
In 2012, Christie&#x27;s auctioned Kandinsky&#x27;s &quot;Studie für Improvisation 8 (Study for Improvisation 8)&quot;, a 1909 view of a man wielding a broadsword in a rainbow-hued village, for $23 million. The painting had been on loan to the Kunstmuseum Winterthur in Switzerland since 1960 and was sold to a European collector by the Volkart Foundation, the charitable arm of the Swiss commodities trading firm Volkart Brothers. Before this sale, the artist&#x27;s last record was set in 1990 when Sotheby&#x27;s sold his &quot;Fugue&quot; (1914) for $20.9 million. On 16 November 2016, Christie&#x27;s auctioned Kandinsky&#x27;s &quot;Rigide et courbé&quot; (&quot;Rigid and bent&quot;), a large 1935 abstract painting, for $23.3 million, a new record for Kandinsky. Solomon R. Guggenheim originally purchased the painting directly from the artist in 1936, but it was not exhibited after 1949; it was then sold at auction to a private collector in 1964 by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.

== Nazi-looted art ==
In July 2001, Jen Lissitzky, the son of artist El Lissitzky, filed a restitution claim against the Beyeler Foundation in Basel, Switzerland for Kandinsky&#x27;s &quot;Improvisation No. 10&quot;. A settlement was reached in 2002.

In 2013, the Lewenstein family filed a claim for the restitution of Kandinsky&#x27;s &quot;Painting with Houses&quot; held by the Stedelijk Museum. In 2020, a committee established by the Dutch minister of culture found fault with the behaviour of the Restitution Committee, causing a scandal where two of its members, including its chairman, resigned. Later that year, a court in Amsterdam ruled that the Stedelijk Museum could retain the painting from the Jewish Lewenstein collection despite the Nazi theft. However, in August 2021, the Amsterdam City Council decided to return the painting to the Lewenstein family.

In 2017, Robert Colin Lewenstein, Francesca Manuela Davis and Elsa Hannchen Guidotti filed suit against Bayerische Landesbank (BLB) for the restitution of Kandinsky&#x27;s &quot;Das Bunte Leben.&quot;

<text>Whistleblowing (also whistle-blowing or whistle blowing) is the activity of a person, often an employee, revealing information about activity within a private or public organization that is deemed illegal, immoral, illicit, unsafe or fraudulent. Whistleblowers can use a variety of internal or external channels to communicate information or allegations. Over 83% of whistleblowers report internally to a supervisor, human resources, compliance, or a neutral third party within the company, hoping that the company will address and correct the issues. A whistleblower can also bring allegations to light by communicating with external entities, such as the media, government, or law enforcement. Some countries legislate as to what constitutes a protected disclosure, and the permissible methods of presenting a disclosure. Whistleblowing can occur in the private sector or the public sector.

Whistleblowers often face retaliation for their disclosure, including termination of employment. Several other actions may also be considered retaliatory, including an unreasonable increase in workloads, reduction of hours, preventing task completion, mobbing or bullying. Laws in many countries attempt to provide protection for whistleblowers and regulate whistleblowing activities. These laws tend to adopt different approaches to public and private sector whistleblowing.

Whistleblowers do not always achieve their aims; for their claims to be credible and successful, they must have compelling evidence so that the government or regulating body can investigate them and hold corrupt companies and/or government agencies to account. To succeed, they must also persist in their efforts over what can often be years, in the face of extensive, coordinated and prolonged efforts that institutions can deploy to silence, discredit, isolate, and erode their financial and mental well-being.

Whistleblowers have been likened to ‘Prophets at work’, but many lose their jobs, are victims of campaigns to discredit and isolate them, suffer financial and mental pressures, and some lose their lives. Such examples include John Barnett, who died on the day he was due to give deposition testimony as a whistleblower against aerospace company Boeing, and David Kelly, who was found dead two days after the UK parliamentary Intelligence and Security and Foreign Affairs Select Committees publicized that he would be called about the dubious claims used to convince the UK Parliament to vote to invade Iraq.

==Overview==
===Origin of term===
U.S. civic activist Ralph Nader is said to have coined the phrase in the early 1970s in order to avoid the negative connotations found in other words such as &quot;informer&quot; and &quot;snitch&quot;. However, the origins of the word date back to the 19th century.

The word is linked to the use of a whistle to alert the public or a crowd about such problems as the commission of a crime or the breaking of rules during a game. The phrase &quot;whistle blower&quot; attached itself to law enforcement officials in the 19th century because they used a whistle to alert the public or fellow police. Sports referees, who use a whistle to indicate an illegal or foul play, also were called whistleblowers.

An 1883 story in Wisconsin&#x27;s Janesville Gazette called a policeman who used his whistle to alert citizens about a riot a &quot;whistle blower&quot;, without the hyphen. By the year 1963, the phrase had become a hyphenated word, &quot;whistle-blower&quot;. The word began to be used by journalists in the 1960s for people who revealed wrongdoing, such as Nader. It eventually evolved into the compound word &quot;whistleblower&quot;.

=== Channels for whistleblowing ===

==== Internal channels ====
Most whistleblowers are internal whistleblowers, who report misconduct on a fellow employee or superior within their company through anonymous reporting mechanisms often called hotlines. Within such situations, circumstances and factors can cause a person to either act on the spot to prevent/stop illegal and unacceptable behavior, or report it. There are some reasons to believe that people are more likely to take action with respect to unacceptable behavior, within an organization, if there are complaint systems that offer not just options dictated by the planning and control organization, but a &quot;choice&quot; of options for absolute confidentiality.

Anonymous reporting mechanisms, as mentioned previously, help foster a climate whereby employees are more likely to report or seek guidance regarding potential or actual wrongdoing without fear of retaliation. The coming anti-bribery management systems standard, ISO 37001, includes anonymous reporting as one of the criteria for the new standard.

==== External channels ====
External whistleblowers report misconduct to outside people or entities. In these cases, depending on the nature of the information, whistleblowers may report the misconduct to lawyers, the media, law enforcement or watchdog agencies, or other local, state, or federal agencies. In some cases, external whistleblowing is encouraged by offering monetary rewards.

==== Third-party channels ====
Sometimes organizations use external agencies to create a secure and anonymous reporting channel for their employees, often referred to as a whistleblowing hotline. In addition to protecting the identity of the whistleblower, these services are designed to inform the individuals at the top of the organizational pyramid of misconduct, usually via integration with specialized case management software.

Implementing a third-party solution is often the easiest way for an organization to promote compliance, or to offer a whistleblowing policy where one did not previously exist. An increasing number of companies and authorities use third-party services in which the whistleblower is also anonymous to the third-party service provider, which is made possible via toll-free phone numbers and/or web or app-based solutions that apply asymmetrical encryption.

=== Private versus public sectors ===

==== Private-sector whistleblowing ====
Private-sector whistleblowing is arguably more prevalent and suppressed in society today. An example of private sector whistleblowing is when an employee reports to someone in a higher position such as a manager or to external factors, such as their lawyer or the police. Whistleblowing in the private sector is typically not high-profile or openly discussed in major news outlets, though occasionally, third parties expose human rights violations and exploitation of workers.

Many governments attempt to protect such whistleblowers. In the United States, for example, there are organizations such as the United States Department of Labor (DOL) and laws such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations (FSGO) that protect whistleblowers in the private sector. Thus, despite government efforts to help regulate the private sector, the employees must still weigh their options. They either expose the company and stand the moral and ethical high ground; or expose the company, lose their job, their reputation and potentially the ability to be employed again. According to a study at the University of Pennsylvania, out of three hundred whistleblowers studied, sixty-nine percent had foregone that exact situation and were either fired or forced to retire after taking the ethical high ground. It is outcomes like these that make it all that much harder to accurately track the prevalence of whistleblowing in the private sector.

==== Public sector whistleblowing ====
Public sector whistleblowing is connected to the concept of public service motivation, where a public servant&#x27;s altruistic alignment to the people or communities they service overrides their adherence to their employer&#x27;s rules. This connection has been demonstrated by research in many different countries, including Poland, Thailand and the United States of America.

Recognition of the value of public sector whistleblowing has been growing over the last 50 years. Many jurisdictions have passed legislation to protect public service whistleblowing in part as a way to address unethical behaviour and corruption within public service agencies.

In the United States, for example, both state and Federal statutes have been put in place to protect whistleblowers from retaliation. The United States Supreme Court ruled that public sector whistleblowers are protected from retaliation by their First Amendment rights. After many federal whistleblowers were covered in high-profile media cases, laws were finally introduced to protect government whistleblowers. These laws were enacted to help prevent corruption and encourage people to expose misconduct, illegal, or dishonest activity for the good of society. People who choose to act as whistleblowers often suffer retaliation from their employer. They most likely are fired because they are an at-will employee, which means they can be fired without a reason. There are exceptions in place for whistleblowers who are at-will employees. Even without a statute, numerous decisions encourage and protect whistleblowing on grounds of public policy. Statutes state that an employer shall not take any adverse employment actions against any employee in retaliation for a good-faith report of a whistleblowing action or cooperating in any way in an investigation, proceeding, or lawsuit arising under said action. Federal whistleblower legislation includes a statute protecting all government employees. In the federal civil service, the government is prohibited from taking, or threatening to take, any personnel action against an employee because the employee disclosed information that they reasonably believed showed a violation of law, gross mismanagement, and gross waste of funds, abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public safety or health. To prevail on a claim, a federal employee must show that a protected disclosure was made, that the accused official knew of the disclosure, that retaliation resulted, and that there was a genuine connection between the retaliation and the employee&#x27;s action.

====Whistleblowing in the scientific community====

Research fraud involves data, processes, or observations that were never there to begin with or later added on to fit a claim or narrative. A case involving the scientific community engaging in research fraudulence is that of Dr. Cyril Burt. Dr Cyril Burt was a British psychologist who proposed that he had discovered a heritable factor for intelligence based on studying twins. Dr. Oliver Gillie, a former colleague of Dr. Burt, inquired about Dr. Burt’s work, doubting the authenticity of the data and the certain twins on that Dr. Burt was basing his research. Dr. Gillies&#x27;s inquiry revealed that there were discrepancies to Dr. Burt’s work with inconsistencies in the twin&#x27;s birth dates  particularly with the absence of records for twins to participate in the study, the falsification of data, and the “invention of crucial facts to support his controversial theory that intelligence is largely inherited.”   This led to the eventual retraction of Dr. Burt’s work.

Data manipulation is the changing or omitting of data or outcomes in such a way that the research is not accurately portrayed in the research record. Dr. Hwang Woo-Suk, a South Korean stem cell researcher gained international recognition for his groundbreaking work on cloning and stem cell research. Dr. Hwang had a claim to successfully clone human embryos and derived patient-specific stem cell lines, forwarding the field of regenerative medicine which was published in the &quot;Journal of Science&quot;. Dr. Kim Seon-Jung expressed his concerns regarding the accuracy of the research data and the ethical conduct of the experiments. Independent committees, as well as journalists, scrutinized the research data and methodology leading to an eventual retraction of his work.

Ethical violations can fall under the following: altering or making up new data to meet a specific goal, adjusting how data is shown or explained, looking at data in a biased manner, and leaving out parts about data analysis and conclusions. Dr. Paolo Macchiarini is well-known within the scientific community as a thoracic surgeon and former regenerative researcher. Dr Macchiarini claimed to have made profound advancements in trachea transplantation by using synthetic tracheal scaffolds planted with the patient’s own stem cells. The goal was that the stem cells would eventually provide the patient with a suitable replacement trachea. Dr. Karl-Henrik Grinnemo, a member of Dr. Machiarini’s research team, raised concerns about the accuracy of the reported results and the ethical conduct of the experiments. Dr. Macchiarini’s ethical violations include exaggeration of success, failure to disclose the adverse post-operational effects, and complications of the surgery. Patients experienced severe health problems; several died post-surgery. The acts of Dr. Macchiarini led to the retractions of research articles from the Lancet, the termination of his academic positions, and criminal inquiries in Sweden. It also sparked concerns over the supervision and control of clinical trials utilizing experimental techniques.

===Risks===
Individual harm, damage to public trust, and threats to national security are three categories of harm that may come as a result of whistleblowing. Revealing a whistleblower&#x27;s identity can automatically put their life in danger. Some media outlets associate words like &quot;traitor&quot; and &quot;treason&quot; with whistleblowers, and in many countries around the world, the punishment for treason is the death penalty, even if whoever allegedly committed treason may not have caused anyone physical harm. In some instances, whistleblowers must flee their country to avoid public scrutiny, threats of death or physical harm, and in some cases criminal charges.

Whistleblowers are often protected under law from employer retaliation, but in many cases, punishment such as termination, suspension, demotion, wage garnishment, and/or harsh mistreatment by other employees occurs. A 2009 study found that up to 38% of whistleblowers experienced professional retaliation in some form, including wrongful termination. Following dismissal, whistleblowers may struggle to find employment due to damaged reputations, poor references, and blacklisting. The socioeconomic impact of whistleblowing through loss of livelihood and family strain may also impact whistleblowers&#x27; psychological well-being. Whistleblowers often experience immense stress as a result of litigation regarding harms such as unfair dismissal, which they often face with little or no support from unions. Whistleblowers who continue to pursue their concerns may also face long battles with official bodies such as regulators and government departments. Such bodies may reproduce the &quot;institutional silence&quot; adopted by employers, adding to whistleblowers&#x27; stress and difficulties. Thus, whistleblowers often suffer great injustice that is never acknowledged or rectified.

In a few cases, however, harm is done by the whistleblower to innocent people. Whistleblowers can make unintentional mistakes, and investigations can be tainted by the fear of negative publicity. An example occurred in the Canadian health ministry, when a new employee wrongly concluded that nearly every research contract she saw in 2012 involved malfeasance. The result was the sudden firing of seven people, false and public threats of a criminal investigation, and the death of one researcher by suicide. The government ultimately paid the victims millions of dollars for lost pay, slander, and other harms, in addition to CA $2.41 million spent on the subsequent 2015 investigation into the false charges.

===Attitudes toward whistleblowers===
Whistleblowers are seen by some as selfless martyrs for public interest and organizational accountability; others view them as &quot;traitors&quot; or &quot;defectors&quot;. Some even accuse them of solely pursuing personal glory and fame, or view their behavior as motivated by greed in qui tam cases. Culturally it still has connotations of betrayal, from &#x27;snitching&#x27; at one level to &#x27;denunciations&#x27; at the other. Speaking out is difficult, especially in a culture where this is not promoted or even actively discouraged. Some academics (such as Thomas Faunce) feel that whistleblowers should at least be entitled to a rebuttable presumption that they are attempting to apply ethical principles in the face of obstacles and that whistleblowing would be more respected in governance systems if it had a firmer academic basis in virtue ethics.

It is likely that many people do not even consider whistleblowing not only because of fear of retaliation but also because of fear of losing relationships both at and outside work.

Persecution of whistleblowers has become a serious issue in many parts of the world:
Employees in academia, business or government might become aware of serious risks to health and the environment, but internal policies might pose threats of retaliation to those who report these early warnings. Private company employees in particular might be at risk of being fired, demoted, denied raises and so on for bringing environmental risks to the attention of appropriate authorities. Government employees could be at a similar risk for bringing threats to health or the environment to public attention, although perhaps this is less likely.
There are examples of &quot;early warning scientists&quot; being harassed for bringing inconvenient truths about impending harm to the notice of the public and authorities. There have also been cases of young scientists being discouraged from entering controversial scientific fields for fear of harassment.

In order to help whistleblowers, private organizations have formed whistleblower legal defense funds or support groups. Examples include the National Whistleblower Center in the United States and Whistleblowers UK and Public Concern at Work (PCaW) in the United Kingdom. Depending on the circumstances, it is not uncommon for whistleblowers to be ostracized by their coworkers, discriminated against by future potential employers, or even fired from their organization. A campaign directed at whistleblowers with the goal of eliminating them from the organization is referred to as mobbing. It is an extreme form of workplace bullying wherein the group is set against the targeted individual.

===Psychological impact===
There is limited research on the psychological impacts of whistle-blowing. However, poor experiences with whistleblowing can cause a prolonged and prominent assault on the well-being of the whistleblower. As workers attempt to address concerns, they are often met with a wall of silence and hostility by management or colleagues. Depression is often reported by whistleblowers, and suicidal thoughts may occur in up to about 10%. General deterioration in health and self-care has been described. The range of symptomatology shares many of the features of posttraumatic stress disorder, though there is debate about whether the trauma experienced by whistleblowers meets diagnostic thresholds. Increased stress-related physical illness has also been described in whistleblowers.

The stresses involved in whistleblowing can be huge and may deter whistleblowing out of fear of failure and reprisals. Some whistleblowers speak of overwhelming and persistent distress, drug and alcohol problems, paranoid behavior at work, acute anxiety, nightmares, flashbacks, and intrusive thoughts. This fear may indeed be justified because an individual who feels threatened by whistleblowing may plan the career destruction of the &quot;complainant&quot; by reporting fictitious errors or rumors. This technique, labelled as &quot;gaslighting&quot;, is a common approach used by organizations to manage employees who cause difficulty by raising concerns. In extreme cases, this technique involves the organization or manager proposing that the complainant&#x27;s mental health is unstable. Organizations also often attempt to ostracize and isolate whistleblowers by undermining their concerns by suggesting that they are groundless, carrying out inadequate investigations, or ignoring them altogether. Whistleblowers may also be disciplined, suspended, and reported to professional bodies upon manufactured pretexts.

Such extreme experiences of threat and loss inevitably cause severe distress and sometimes mental illness, sometimes lasting for years afterwards. This mistreatment also deters others from coming forward with concerns. Thus, poor practices remain hidden behind a wall of silence, and prevent any organization from experiencing the improvements that may be afforded by intelligent failure. Some whistleblowers who break ranks with their organizations have had their mental stability questioned, such as Adrian Schoolcraft, the NYPD veteran who alleged falsified crime statistics in his department and was forcibly committed to a mental institution. Conversely, the emotional strain of a whistleblower investigation is devastating to the accused&#x27;s family.

===Ethics===
Ethics is the set of moral principles that govern a person&#x27;s or group&#x27;s behavior. Deeper questions and theories of whistleblowing and why people choose to do so can be studied through an ethical approach. Whistleblowing is a topic of several myths and inaccurate definitions. Leading arguments in the ideological camp maintain that whistleblowing is the most basic of ethical traits and simply telling the truth to stop illegal harmful activities or fraud against the government/taxpayers. In the opposite camp, many corporations and corporate or government leaders see whistleblowing as being disloyal for breaching confidentiality, especially in industries that handle sensitive client or patient information. Hundreds of laws grant protection to whistleblowers, but stipulations can easily cloud that protection and leave them vulnerable to retaliation and sometimes even threats and physical harm. However, the decision and action has become far more complicated with recent advancements in technology and communication.

The ethical implications of whistleblowing can be negative as well as positive. Some have argued that public sector whistleblowing plays an important role in the democratic process by resolving principal–agent problems. However, sometimes employees may blow the whistle as an act of revenge. Rosemary O&#x27;Leary explains this in her short volume on a topic called guerrilla government. &quot;Rather than acting openly, guerrillas often choose to remain &quot;in the closet&quot;, moving clandestinely behind the scenes, salmon swimming upstream against the current of power. Over the years, I have learned that the motivations driving guerrillas are diverse. The reasons for acting range from the altruistic (doing the right thing) to the seemingly petty (I was passed over for that promotion). Taken as a whole, their acts are as awe-inspiring as saving human lives out of a love of humanity and as trifling as slowing the issuance of a report out of spite or anger.&quot; For example, of the more than 1,000 whistleblower complaints that are filed each year with the Pentagon&#x27;s Inspector General, about 97 percent are not substantiated. It is believed throughout the professional world that an individual is bound to secrecy within their work sector. Discussions of whistleblowing and employee loyalty usually assume that the concept of loyalty is irrelevant to the issue or more commonly, that whistleblowing involves a moral choice that pits the loyalty that an employee owes an employer against the employee&#x27;s responsibility to serve the public interest. Robert A. Larmer describes the standard view of whistleblowing in the &quot;Journal of Business Ethics&quot; by explaining that an employee possesses prima facie (based on the first impression; accepted as correct until proved otherwise) duties of loyalty and confidentiality to their employers and that whistleblowing cannot be justified except on the basis of a higher duty to the public good. It is important to recognize that in any relationship which demands loyalty the relationship works both ways and involves mutual enrichment.

The ethics of Edward Snowden&#x27;s actions have been widely discussed and debated in news media and academia worldwide. Snowden released classified intelligence to the American people in an attempt to allow Americans to see the inner workings of the government. A person is diligently tasked with the of choosing to be loyal to the company or to blow the whistle on the company&#x27;s wrongdoing. Discussions on whistleblowing generally revolve around three topics: attempts to define whistleblowing more precisely, debates about whether and when whistleblowing is permissible, and debates about whether and when one has an obligation to blow the whistle.

===Motivations===
Many whistleblowers have stated that they were motivated to take action to put an end to unethical practices after witnessing injustices in their businesses or organizations. A 2009 study found that whistleblowers are often motivated to take action when they notice a sharp decline in ethical practices, as opposed to a gradual worsening. There are generally two metrics by which whistleblowers determine if a practice is unethical. The first metric involves a violation of the organization&#x27;s bylaws or written ethical policies. These violations allow individuals to concretize and rationalize blowing the whistle. On the other hand, &quot;value-driven&quot; whistleblowers are influenced by their personal codes of ethics or by public service motivation which comes from an alignment of personal, cultural and organisational values. In these cases, whistleblowers have been criticized for being driven by personal biases.

In addition to ethics, social and organizational pressure are motivating forces. A 2012 study shows that individuals are more likely to blow the whistle when others know about the wrongdoing, because they fear the consequences of keeping silent. In cases where one person is responsible for wrongdoing, the whistleblower may file a formal report, rather than directly confronting the wrongdoer, because confrontation would be more emotionally and psychologically stressful. Furthermore, individuals may be motivated to report unethical behavior when they believe their organizations will support them. Professionals in management roles may feel responsibility to blow the whistle to uphold the values and rules of their organizations.

==Legal protection for whistleblowers==
Legal protection for whistleblowers varies from country to country and may depend on the country of the original activity, where and how secrets were revealed, and how they eventually became published or publicized. Over a dozen countries have now adopted comprehensive whistleblower protection laws that create mechanisms for reporting wrongdoing and provide legal protections. Over 50 countries have adopted more limited protections as part of their anti-corruption, freedom of information, or employment laws.

&quot;For purposes of the English Wikipedia, this section emphasizes the English-speaking world and covers other regimes only insofar as they represent exceptionally greater or lesser protections.&quot;

===Australia===

There are laws in a number of states. The former Australian intelligence officer known as &quot;Witness K&quot;, who provided evidence of Australia&#x27;s controversial spying operation against the government of East Timor in 2004, face the possibility of jail if convicted.

Whistleblowers Australia is an association for those who have exposed corruption or any form of malpractice, especially if they were then hindered or abused.

===Canada===
The Public Sector Integrity Commissioner (PSIC) provides a safe and confidential mechanism enabling public servants and the general public to disclose wrongdoings committed in the public sector. It also protects from reprisal public servants who have disclosed wrongdoing and those who have cooperated in investigations. The office&#x27;s goal is to enhance public confidence in Canada&#x27;s federal public institutions and in the integrity of public servants.

Mandated by the &quot;Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act&quot;, PSIC is a permanent and independent agent of Parliament. The act, which came into force in 2007, applies to most of the federal public sector, approximately 400,000 public servants. This includes government departments and agencies, parent Crown corporations, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and other federal public sector bodies.

Not all disclosures lead to an investigation as the act sets out the jurisdiction of the commissioner and gives the option not to investigate under certain circumstances. On the other hand, if PSIC conducts an investigation and finds no wrongdoing was committed, the commissioner must report his findings to the discloser and to the organization&#x27;s chief executive. Also, reports of founded wrongdoing are presented before the House of Commons and the Senate in accordance with the act.

The act also established the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Tribunal (PSDPT) to protect public servants by hearing reprisal complaints referred by the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner. The tribunal can grant remedies in favour of complainants and order disciplinary action against persons who take reprisals.

===European Union===
The European Parliament approved a &quot;Whistleblower Protection Directive&quot; containing broad free speech protections for whistleblowers in both the public and the private sectors, including for journalists, in all member states of the European Union. The Directive prohibits direct or indirect retaliation against employees, current and former, in the public sector and the private sector. The Directive&#x27;s protections apply to employees, to volunteers, and to those who assist them, including to civil society organizations and to journalists who report on their evidence. In October 2021, the EU Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers, Equality and the Rule of Law emphasized that ministries, as legal entities in the public sector, are also explicitly required to establish internal reporting channels for their employees. It provides equal rights for whistleblowers in the national security sector who challenge the denial or removal of their security clearances. Also, whistleblowers are protected from criminal prosecution and corporate lawsuits for damages resulting from their whistleblowing and are provided with psychological support for dealing with harassment stress.

Good government observers have hailed the EU directive as setting &quot;the global standard for best practice rights protecting freedom of speech where it counts the most—challenging abuses of power that betray the public trust,&quot; according to the U.S.-based Government Accountability Project. They have noted, however, that ambiguities remain in the directive regarding application in some areas, such as &quot;duty speech&quot;, that is, when employees report the same information in the course of a job assignment, for example, to a supervisor, instead of whistleblowing as formal dissent. In fact, duty speech is how the overwhelming majority of whistleblowing information gets communicated and where the free flow of information is needed for an organization&#x27;s proper functioning. However, it is in response to such &quot;duty speech&quot; employee communication that the vast majority of retaliation against employees occurs. These observers have noted that the Directive must be understood as applying to protection against retaliation for such duty speech because without such an understanding the Directive will &quot;miss the iceberg of what&#x27;s needed&quot;.

==== France ====
In France, several recent laws have established a protection regime for whistleblowers. Prior to 2016, there were several laws in force which created disparate legislation with sector-specific regimes. The 2016 law on transparency, the fight against corruption and modernization of economic life (known as the &quot;Sapin 2 Law&quot;) provides for the first time a single legal definition of whistleblowers in France. It defines him or her as &quot;an individual who discloses or reports, in a disinterested manner and in good faith, a crime or an offence, a serious and manifest breach of an international commitment duly ratified or approved by France, a unilateral act of an international organization adopted on the basis of such a commitment, of the law or regulations, or a serious threat or harm to general interest, which he or she has become personally aware of.&quot; It excludes certain professional secrets such as national defense secrecy, medical secrecy or the secrecy of relations between a lawyer and his client.

In 2022, two laws were passed to transpose the European Directive 2019/1937 of 23 October 2019 on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law. One of them strengthens the role of the Défenseur des droits - the French ombudsman - tasked with advising and protecting whistleblowers. The second amends the Sapin 2 law to bring it into line with the directive and adds substantial guarantees not included in the directive among which:

* The definition of whistleblowing in force under the &quot;Sapin 2 Law&quot; – which includes whistleblowing not based on work - has been maintained.
* The protection applies to any natural person who facilitates or assists whistleblowers – as required in the directive – but also to entities such as NGOs (Non-governmental organizations) or trade unions, which act as a facilitator. They are offered the same level of protection.
* Military personnel will now be afforded the same level of protection as other civil servants, so long as they do not disclose information that may harm national security.
* The law provides that whistleblowers may be granted financial assistance, when subjected to a suit, by making an application to a judge, who has the power to force the suing organization – the employer, for instance - to cover their legal fees and if their financial situation has deteriorated, their living expenses.
* The law provides that whistleblowers shall not incur criminal liability with respect to the acquisition of, or access to, the information that is reported or publicly disclosed. They cannot be sentenced for any offenses committed in order to gather proof or information as long as they obtained it in a lawful manner.
* The law strengthens existing sanctions against those who retaliate against whistleblowers: The criminal sanctions applicable to persons retaliating against whistleblowers can go up to three years of imprisonment and a fine of €45,000. The judges may impose €60,000 fines on companies taking a SLAPP action against a whistleblower.

The law allows any person to apply to the Défenseur des droits for an opinion on his or her status as a whistleblower. A response should be given within six months after receiving the application. The organic law provides that the Défenseur des droits will publish a report every two years on the overall functioning of whistleblower protection addressed to the French President of the Republic, the President of the National Assembly, and the President of the Senate.

===Jamaica===
In Jamaica, the Protected Disclosures Act, 2011 received assent in March 2011. It creates a comprehensive system for the protection of whistleblowers in the public and private sectors. It is based on the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998.

===India===

The Government of India has been considering adopting a whistleblower protection law for several years. In 2003, the Law Commission of India recommended the adoption of the Public Interest Disclosure (Protection of Informers) Act, of 2002. In August 2010, the Public Interest Disclosure and Protection of Persons Making the Disclosures Bill, 2010 was introduced into the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament of India. The Bill was approved by the cabinet in June 2011. The Public Interest Disclosure and Protection of Persons Making the Disclosures Bill, 2010 was renamed the Whistleblowers&#x27; Protection Bill, 2011 by the Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice. The Whistleblowers&#x27; Protection Bill, 2011 was passed by the Lok Sabha on 28 December 2011. and by the Rajyasabha on 21 February 2014. The Whistle Blowers Protection Act, 2011 received Presidential assent on 9 May 2014 and the same was subsequently published in the official gazette of the Government of India on 9 May 2014 by the Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India.

===Iran===
In 2023, the Iranian government made public whistleblowing punishable by law if a whistleblower reveals corruption to authorities that can&#x27;t be proved.

===Ireland===
The government of Ireland committed to adopting a comprehensive whistleblower protection law in January 2012. The Protected Disclosures Act (PDA) was passed in 2014. The law covers workers in the public and private sectors, and also includes contractors, trainees, agency staff, former employees and job seekers. A range of different types of misconduct may be reported under the law, which provides protections for workers from a range of employment actions as well as whistleblowers&#x27; identity.

===Netherlands===
The Netherlands has measures in place to mitigate the risks of whistleblowing: The House for Whistleblowers (Huis voor klokkenluiders) offers advice and support to whistleblowers, and the Parliament passed a proposal in 2016 to establish this house for whistleblowers, to protect them from the severe negative consequences that they might endure (Kamerstuk, 2013). Dutch media organizations also provide whistleblower support; on 9September 2013, a number of major Dutch media outlets supported the launch of Publeaks, which provides a secure website for people to leak documents to the media. Publeaks is designed to protect whistleblowers. It operates on the GlobaLeaks software developed by the Hermes Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights, which supports whistleblower-oriented technologies internationally.

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, the Protected Disclosures (Protection of Whistleblowers) Act 2022 provides protection to whistleblowers under some circumstances. A wide range of workers are covered, including employees, volunteers and contractors, and the legislation covers both public and private sector organisations. Protection is limited to serious misconduct, and disclosure by workers it does not cover others who learn of serious misconduct. To be protected by the Act the disclosure must be to an Appropriate Authority this means that disclosure to the media is not protected. Whistleblowers covered by the Act are protected from civil, criminal and disciplinary procedures as well as retaliation, in most cases their identities must be kept confidential. The Act also requires that Public service agencies must have internal processes to support whistleblowing.

This Act replaced and extended the Protected Disclosures Act 2000. The genesis of the legislation was advocacy by Sir John Robertson in the 1980s, at the time New Zealand&#x27;s Chief Ombudsman. The subsequent high-profile case of whistleblower Neil Pugmire who raised concerns about the release of dangerous mental health patients led to the 2000 act.

===Switzerland===
The Swiss Council of States agreed on a draft amendment of the Swiss Code of Obligations in September 2014. The draft introduces articles 321abis to 321asepties, 328(3), 336(2)(d). An amendment of article 362(1) adds articles 321abis to 321asepties to the list of provisions that may not be overruled by labour and bargaining agreements.
Article 321ater introduces an obligation on employees to report irregularities to their employer before reporting to an authority. An employee will, however, not breach his duty of good faith if he reports an irregularity to an authority and
* a period set by the employer and no longer than 60 days has lapsed since the employee has reported the incident to his employer, and
* the employer has not addressed the irregularity or it is obvious that the employer has insufficiently addressed the irregularity.
Article 321aquarter provides that an employee may exceptionally directly report to an authority. Exceptions apply in cases
* where the employee is in a position to objectively demonstrate that a report to his employer will prove ineffective,
* where the employee has to anticipate dismissal,
* where the employee must assume that the competent authority will be hindered in investigating the irregularity, or
* where there is a direct and serious hazard to life, to health, to safety, or to the environment.
The draft does not improve on protection against dismissal for employees who report irregularities to their employer. The amendment does not provide for employees to anonymously file their observations of irregularities.

===United Kingdom===

Whistleblowing in the United Kingdom is protected by the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 (PIDA). Amongst other things, under the Act protected disclosures are permitted even if a non-disclosure agreement has been signed between the employer and the former or current employee; a consultation on further restricting confidentiality clauses was held in 2019.

The Freedom to Speak Up Review sets out 20 principles to bring about improvements to help whistleblowers in the NHS, including:
* Culture of raising concerns – to make raising issues a part of the normal routine business of a well-led NHS organization.
* Culture free from bullying – freedom of staff to speak out relies on staff being able to work in a culture which is free from bullying.
* Training – every member of staff should receive training in their trust&#x27;s approach to raising concerns and in receiving and acting on them.
* Support – all NHS trusts should ensure there is a dedicated person to whom concerns can be easily reported and without formality, a &quot;speak up guardian&quot;.
* Support to find alternative employment in the NHS – where a worker who has raised a concern cannot, as a result, continue their role, the NHS should help them seek an alternative job.

Monitor produced a whistleblowing policy in November 2015 that all NHS organizations in England are obliged to follow. It explicitly says that anyone bullying or acting against a whistleblower could be potentially liable to disciplinary action. An observational and interviewed-based study of more than 80 Guardians found that a lack of resources, especially time, reduced their ability to respond to concerns, and to analyse and learn from data. Guardians struggled to develop their role, and create a more positive culture in which staff felt free to voice concerns. Guardians found their role stressful and received little psychological support and as a result many did not intend to stay in their role for long.

===United States===
Whistleblowing tradition in what would soon become the United States had a start in 1773 with Benjamin Franklin leaking a few letters in the Hutchinson affair. The release of the communications from royal governor Thomas Hutchinson to Thomas Whately led to a firing, a duel and arguably, both through the many general impacts of the leak and its role in convincing Franklin to join the radicals&#x27; cause, the taking of another important final step toward the American Revolution.

The first act of the Continental Congress in favor of what later came to be called whistleblowing came in the 1777-8 case of Samuel Shaw and Richard Marven. The two seamen accused Commander in Chief of the Continental Navy Esek Hopkins of torturing British prisoners of war. The Congress dismissed Hopkins and then agreed to cover the defense cost of the pair after Hopkins filed a libel suit against them under which they were imprisoned. Shaw and Marven were subsequently cleared in a jury trial.

To be considered a whistleblower in the United States, most federal whistleblower statutes require that federal employees have reason to believe their employer violated some law, rule, or regulation; testify in or commence a legal proceeding on the legally protected matter; or refuse to violate the law.

In cases where whistleblowing on a specified topic is protected by statute, U.S. courts have generally held that such whistleblowers are protected from retaliation. However, a closely divided U.S. Supreme Court decision, &quot;Garcetti v. Ceballos&quot; (2006) held that the First Amendment free speech guarantees for government employees do not protect disclosures made within the scope of the employees&#x27; duties.

In the United States, legal protections vary according to the subject matter of the whistleblowing and sometimes the state where the case arises. In passing the 2002 Sarbanes–Oxley Act, the Senate Judiciary Committee found that whistleblower protections were dependent on the &quot;patchwork and vagaries&quot; of varying state statutes. Still, a wide variety of federal and state laws protect employees who call attention to violations, help with enforcement proceedings, or refuse to obey unlawful directions. While this patchwork approach has often been criticized, it is also responsible for the United States having more dedicated whistleblowing laws than any other country.

The first US law adopted specifically to protect whistleblowers was the 1863 United States False Claims Act (revised in 1986), which tried to combat fraud by suppliers of the United States government during the American Civil War. The act encourages whistleblowers by promising them a percentage of the money recovered by the government and by protecting them from employment retaliation.

Another US law specifically protecting whistleblowers is the Lloyd–La Follette Act of 1912. It guaranteed the right of federal employees to furnish information to the United States Congress. The first US environmental law to include employee protection was the Clean Water Act of 1972. Similar protections are included in subsequent federal environmental laws, including the Safe Drinking Water Act (1974), Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (1976), Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 (through 1978 amendment to protect nuclear whistleblowers), Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA, or the Superfund Law) (1980), and Clean Air Act (1990). Similar employee protections enforced through OSHA are included in the Surface Transportation Assistance Act (1982) to protect truck drivers, the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act (PSIA) of 2002, the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (AIR 21), and the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, enacted on July 30, 2002 (for corporate fraud whistleblowers). More recent laws with some whistleblower protection include the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA), Seamans Protection Act as amended by the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010 (SPA), Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA), FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), and Taxpayer First Act (TFA).

Investigation of retaliation against whistleblowers under 23 federal statutes falls under the jurisdiction of the Directorate of Whistleblower Protection Program (DWPP) of the United States Department of Labor&#x27;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). New whistleblower statutes enacted by Congress, which are to be enforced by the Secretary of Labor, are generally delegated by a Secretary&#x27;s Order to the DWPP.

The patchwork of laws means that victims of retaliation need to be aware of the laws at issue to determine the deadlines and means for making proper complaints. Some deadlines are as short as 10 days (Arizona State Employees have 10 days to file a &quot;Prohibited Personnel Practice&quot; Complaint before the Arizona State Personnel Board), while others are up to 300 days.

Those who report a false claim against the federal government, and suffer adverse employment actions as a result, may have up to six years (depending on state law) to file a civil suit for remedies under the US False Claims Act (FCA). Under a &quot;qui tam&quot; provision, the &quot;original source&quot; for the report may be entitled to a percentage of what the government recovers from the offenders. However, the &quot;original source&quot; must also be the first to file a federal civil complaint for recovery of the federal funds fraudulently obtained, and must avoid publicizing the claim of fraud until the US Justice Department decides whether to prosecute the claim itself. Such &quot;qui tam&quot; lawsuits must be filed under seal, using special procedures to keep the claim from becoming public until the federal government makes its decision on direct prosecution. Whistleblowers acting under the FCA are the primary enforcement tool used by the U.S. Department of Justice to target fraud, including overbilling to government programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare.

The Espionage Act of 1917 has been used to prosecute whistleblowers in the United States including Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning. In 2013, Manning was convicted of violating the Espionage Act and sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking sensitive military documents to WikiLeaks. The same year, Snowden was charged with violating the Espionage Act for releasing confidential documents belonging to the NSA.

Section 922 of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) in the United States incentivizes and protects whistleblowers. By Dodd-Frank, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) financially rewards whistleblowers for providing original information about violations of federal securities laws that results in sanctions of at least $1M. Additionally, Dodd-Frank offers job security to whistleblowers by illegalizing termination or discrimination due to whistleblowing. The whistleblower provision has proven successful; after the enactment of Dodd-Frank, the SEC charged KBR (company) and BlueLinx Holdings Inc. (company) with violating the whistleblower protection Rule 21F-17 by having employees sign confidentiality agreements that threatened repercussions for discussing internal matters with outside parties. Former President Donald Trump announced plans to dismantle Dodd-Frank in 2016. He created the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection as a part of the Department of Veterans Affairs, which reportedly instead punished whistleblowers.

The US Department of Labor&#x27;s Whistleblower Protection Program can handle many types of retaliation claims based on legal actions an employee took or was perceived to take in the course of their employment. Moreover, in the United States, if the retaliation occurred due to the perception of who the employee is as a person, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission may be able to accept a complaint of retaliation. In an effort to overcome those fears, in 2010, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was put forth to provide great incentive to whistleblowers. For example, if a whistleblower gave information that could be used to legally recover over one million dollars, then they could receive ten to thirty percent of it.

Whistleblowers have risen within the technology industry as it has expanded in recent years. Protection for these specific whistleblowers falls short; they often end up unemployed or in jail. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act offers an incentive for private sector whistleblowers but only if they go to the SEC with information. If a whistleblower acts internally, as they often do in the technology industry, they are not protected by the law. Scandals such as the Dragonfly search engine scandal and the Pompliano lawsuit against Snapchat have drawn attention to whistleblowers in technology.

The federally recognized National Whistleblower Appreciation Day is observed annually on July 30, on the anniversary of the country&#x27;s original 1778 whistleblower protection law.

===Other countries===
South Africa adopted comprehensive legal protections for whistleblowers with the Protected Disclosures Act of 2000 (PDA). The PDA was further strengthened by the passage of an Amendment Act in 2017.

A number of other countries have adopted comprehensive whistleblower laws, including Ghana&#x27;s Whistleblowers Act (Act 720), 2006.
South Korea, Uganda, 
Kenya, and Rwanda also have Whistleblower laws. The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2008 that whistleblowing was protected as freedom of expression.

Nigeria set up a whistleblowing policy against corruption and other ills. Nigeria formulated a Whistleblowing Policy in 2016, but this has not yet been established as law. A new draft bill for Whistle-blower Protection was approved by the Federal Executive Council (FEC) as of December 2022. The new draft whistleblower protection bill was presented to the National Assembly for consideration by President Muhammadu Buhari in May 2023. Buhari&#x27;s term as President ends on May 29, 2023.

=== Advocacy for protection ===
Many NGOs advocate for stronger and more comprehensive legal rights and protections for whistleblowers. Among them are the Government Accountability Project (GAP), Blueprint for Free Speech, Public Concern at Work (PCaW), the Open Democracy Advice Centre or in France, the Maison des Lanceurs d&#x27;Alerte (MLA). An international network - the Whistleblowing International Network (WIN) - aimed at gathering these NGOs.

Frank Serpico, an NYPD whistleblower, prefers to use the term &quot;lamp-lighter&quot; to describe the whistleblower&#x27;s role as a watchman. The Lamplighter Project, which aims to encourage law enforcement officers to report corruption and abuse of power and helps them do so, is named based on Serpico&#x27;s usage of the term.

==Methods used==
Whistleblowers who may be at risk from those they are exposing are now using encryption methods and anonymous content-sharing software to protect their identity. Tor, a highly accessible anonymity network, is frequently used by whistleblowers around the world. Tor has undergone a number of large security updates to protect the identities of potential whistleblowers who may wish to leak information anonymously.

Recently specialized whistleblowing software like SecureDrop and GlobaLeaks has been built on top of the Tor technology to incentivize and simplify its adoption for secure whistleblowing.

===Whistleblowing hotline===
In business, whistleblowing hotlines are usually deployed to mitigate risk, with the intention of providing secure, anonymous reporting for employees or third-party suppliers who may otherwise be fearful of reprisals from their employer. As such, implementing a corporate whistleblowing hotline is often seen as a step toward compliance and can also highlight an organization&#x27;s stance on ethics. It is widely agreed that implementing a dedicated service for whistleblowers has a positive effect on organizational culture.

A whistleblowing hotline is sometimes also referred to as an &quot;ethics hotline&quot; or &quot;&quot;Speak Up&quot; hotline&quot; and is often facilitated by an outsourced service provider to encourage potential disclosers to come forward.

In 2018, the &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; published findings to support the idea that whistleblowing hotlines are crucial to keeping companies healthy, stating, &quot;More whistles blown are a sign of health, not illness.&quot;

==In popular culture==
One of the subplots for season6 of the popular American TV show &quot;The Office&quot; focuses on Andy Bernard, a salesman, discovering that his company&#x27;s printers catch on fire, his struggling with how to deal with the news, and the company&#x27;s response to the whistleblower going public.

The 1998 film &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot; involves Picard and the NCC-1701-E &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew risking their Starfleet careers to blow the whistle on a Federation conspiracy with the Son&#x27;a to forcibly relocate the Ba&#x27;ku from their planet.

In 2014, the rock/industrial band Laibach released a song titled &quot;The Whistleblowers&quot; on their eighth studio album, &quot;Spectre&quot;. It was released on 3 March 2014 under Mute Records.

In 2016, the rock band Thrice released a song titled &quot;Whistleblower&quot; on the album &quot;To Be Everywhere Is to Be Nowhere&quot;. The song is written from the perspective of Snowden.

In July 2018, CBS debuted a reality television show titled &quot;Whistleblower&quot;, hosted by lawyer, former judge, and police officer Alex Ferrer, that covers &quot;qui tam&quot; suits under the False Claims Act against companies that have allegedly defrauded the federal government.

<doc id="33822" wikidata="Q267949" url="?curid=33822" title="Westwood Studios">
<text>Westwood Studios, Inc. was an American video game developer based in Las Vegas, Nevada. It was founded by Brett Sperry and Louis Castle in 1985 as Brelous Software, but got changed after 2 months into Westwood Associates and was renamed to Westwood Studios when Virgin Games (later Virgin Interactive Entertainment) bought the company in 1992. The company was bought by Electronic Arts alongside Virgin Interactive&#x27;s North American operations in 1998. In January 2003, it was announced that Westwood, alongside Westwood Pacific (EA Pacific), would be merged into EA Los Angeles. The main studio location closed in March of that year.

Westwood is best known for developing video games in the real-time strategy, adventure and role-playing genres. It was listed in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; for selling 30 million copies of &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; games worldwide.

==History==
===Early history and company name===

Brett Sperry and Louis Castle met in late 1983 in Las Vegas. Sperry had a background in architecture and psychology and was already working in the gaming industry. Both Sperry and Castle worked as contract programmers. The two eventually became friends and decided to form a company together and named it Brelous Software. It was later renamed Westwood Associates.

According to Louis Castle, the company was named after the &quot;entertainment meets professional&quot; character of the Westwood neighborhood in Los Angeles.

The company&#x27;s first projects consisted of contract work for companies like Epyx and Strategic Simulations, Inc. (SSI), porting 8-bit titles to 16-bit systems like Commodore Amiga and Atari ST. Proceeds from contract work allowed the company to expand into designing its own games in-house. Their first original title was &quot;Mars Saga&quot;, a game developed for Electronic Arts and released in 1988. They laid the foundations for the real-time strategy genre with the release of real-time tactics game &quot;&quot;, one of the more literal translations of the tabletop game &quot;BattleTech&quot;.

===Later success and acquisition by Virgin Games===
One of the company&#x27;s first great successes was &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; (1991), a real-time role-playing video game based on the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; license, developed for SSI. Other publishers of early Westwood games included Infocom and Disney. Their company was eventually acquired by Virgin Games in 1992.

The company in the late 1980s was known for shipping products late, but by 1993 it had so improved that, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; reported, &quot;many publishers would assure [us] that a project was going to be completed on time &quot;because&quot; Westwood was doing it&quot;. The magazine added that it &quot;not only has a solid reputation for getting product out on time, but a reputation for &quot;good&quot; product&quot;, citing &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Kyrandia&quot;, and &quot;Dune II&quot; as examples. By then Westwood had about 50 employees, including up to 20 artists. Other Westwood titles from the early 1990s include &quot;Lands of Lore&quot;, &quot;The Lion King&quot; and &quot;Young Merlin&quot;. Westwood&#x27;s greatest commercial success would start in 1995 with the real-time strategy game &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot;. Building on the gameplay and interface ideas of &quot;Dune II&quot;, it added pre-rendered 3D graphics for gameplay sprites and video cinematics, an alternative pop/rock soundtrack with techno elements streamed from disk, and online play. &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot;, &quot;Kyrandia&quot;, and &quot;Lands of Lore&quot; spawned several sequels.

===Acquisition by EA and liquidation===
In August 1998, Westwood and sister company Burst Studios was acquired by Electronic Arts for $122.5 million from Virgin Interactive&#x27;s North American operations, which EA also acquired. At the time, Westwood games had a 5% to 6% share of the PC game market, especially the &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; franchise was considered very valuable. The 50,000 square foot building in Las Vegas included motion capture facilities, comfortable offices and was considered a showcase for the industry. According to Westwood Studios designer and programmer Joe Bostic, Electronic Arts did not interfere with Westwood&#x27;s operations primarily due to Westwood co-founder Brett Sperry&#x27;s efforts in keeping the corporate cultures of the two companies separate, but eventually Westwood succumbed to wishes that every game had to be a hit.

The last games &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade&quot; and &quot;Earth &amp; Beyond&quot; did not meet expectations of the publisher. In January 2003, EA announced their intent to close Westwood, as well as EA Pacific, and merge them into EA Los Angeles as part of a consolidation plan. This move included &quot;significant layoffs&quot; for Westwood, which at the time employed 100 people, while the remaining people were given the option to transfer to the Los Angeles studio or EA&#x27;s headquarters. Most employees were let go by January 31, while some staff stayed with Westwood transitionally until it was fully closed on March 31, 2003. Some formed Petroglyph Games in April 2003, while another three (Brett Sperry, Adam Isgreen and Rade Stojsavljevic) formed a development studio called Jet Set Games in 2008, both based in Las Vegas, Nevada.

== Technology ==
Westwood&#x27;s last major engine before acquisition by EA, commonly known as the Strategy Action Game Engine (SAGE), originally named W3D, was a major modification of the SurRender 3D engine developed by Hybrid Graphics Ltd. Westwood first used W3D on &quot;&quot; and for their first-person shooter &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade&quot; and their massively multiplayer online role-playing game &quot;Earth &amp; Beyond&quot;.

After Westwood was dissolved by their parent company, Electronic Arts, the engine was renamed SAGE (Strategy Action Game Engine) and updated for the release of &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Generals&quot;. The rendering portion remained nearly identical to the W3D engine, but most other elements had been redesigned from the ground up. The updated SAGE engine allowed for dynamic lighting that would cast realistic shadows and reflections on most objects, as well as higher quality visual effects and a stop-motion camera feature. The SAGE engine would continue to be used by EA Los Angeles on additional titles in the &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; series and on the real-time strategy series &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth&quot;.

Following the release of the &quot;Command &amp; Conquer 3&quot; expansion &quot;Kane&#x27;s Wrath&quot;, the engine underwent a large overhaul of its major systems. This new version of the engine was called SAGE 2.0 and was first used on &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3&quot;. Major upgrades included support for the PlayStation 3, an upgrade of the renderer to RNA (RenderWare New Architecture), complete replacement of the math library with RenderWare Math, integration of RenderWare Physics, dynamic environmental music, and numerous minor internal improvements. A common misconception was that the new engine itself was called RNA when in fact RNA only referred to the renderer. The last title to use the SAGE 2.0 engine was &quot;Command &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight&quot;.

<doc id="33823" wikidata="Q1374720" url="?curid=33823" title="William Ames">
<text>William Ames (; Latin: &quot;Guilielmus Amesius&quot;; 157614 November 1633) was an English Puritan minister, philosopher, and controversialist. He spent much time in the Netherlands, and is noted for his involvement in the controversy between the Calvinists and the Arminians.

==Early life and education==
Ames was born at Ipswich, and was brought up by a maternal uncle, Robert Snelling of Boxford. He was educated at the local grammar school and from 1594 at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He was considerably influenced by his tutor at Christ&#x27;s, William Perkins, and by his successor Paul Bayne. Ames graduated BA in 1598 and MA in 1601, and was chosen for a fellowship in Christ&#x27;s College.

He was popular in the university, and in his own college. One of Ames&#x27;s sermons became historical in the Puritan controversies. It was delivered in the university Church of St Mary the Great, Cambridge on 21 December 1609, and in it he rebuked sharply &quot;lusory lotts&quot; and the &quot;heathenish debauchery&quot; of the students during the Twelve Days of Christmas.

A partisan election, however, had led to the mastership at Christ&#x27;s going to Valentine Carey. He quarrelled with Ames for disapproving of the surplice and other outward symbols. Ames&#x27;s vehemence led to his being summoned before the Vice-Chancellor, who suspended him &quot;from the exercise of his ecclesiastical function and from all degrees taken or to be taken.&quot;

==Ministry in Holland==
He left Cambridge, and was offered a lecturer position at Colchester, but George Abbot, the Bishop of London, went against the wishes of the local corporation, and refused to grant institution and induction. Similar rebuffs awaited him elsewhere, and he travelled with Robert Parker to the Netherlands, helped by English merchants who wished him to controvert the supporters of the English church in Leiden. At Rotterdam, he debated with Grevinchovius (Nicholas Grevinckhoven, died 1632), minister of the Arminian party, with reasoning from &quot;Philippians&quot; ii. 13, &quot;It is God that worketh in us both to will and to do.&quot;
This dispute made his name in the Netherlands.

Subsequently, Ames entered into a controversy in print with Grevinchovius on universal redemption and election, and cognate problems. He brought together all he had maintained in his &quot;Coronis ad Collationem Hagiensem&quot; (A Finishing Touch to the Hague Conference)—his major book. At Leiden, Ames became intimate with Hugh Goodyear, pastor of the English church there. He was sent for to The Hague by Sir Horatio Vere, the English governor of Brill, who appointed him a minister in the army of the states-general, and of the English soldiers in their service. He married a daughter of John Burges, who was Vere&#x27;s chaplain, and, on his father-in-law&#x27;s return to England, succeeded to his place.

It was at this time he began his controversy with Simon Episcopius, who, in attacking the &quot;Coronis&quot;, railed against the author as having been &quot;a disturber of the public peace in his native country, so that the English magistrates had banished him thence; and now, by his late printed &quot;Coronis&quot;, he was raising new disturbances in the peaceable Netherlands.&quot; Episcopius was rebutted by Goodyear, who became a defender of Ames against the Remonstrants, and later provided Nethenus with material for his biography of Ames.

The &quot;Coronis&quot; had been primarily prepared for the Synod of Dort, which sat from 13 November 1618 until 9 May 1619. At this synod the position of Ames was anomalous. The High Church party in England had induced Vere to dismiss him from the chaplaincy; but he was still held in reverence. It was arranged he should attend the synod, and he was retained by the Calvinist party at four florins a day to watch the proceedings. He was adviser to Johannes Bogerman, the synod&#x27;s president.

==Academic==

A proposal to make him principal of a theological college at Leiden was frustrated by Archbishop Abbot; and when later invited by the state of Friesland to a professoriate at Franeker, the opposition was renewed, but this time abortively. 
He was installed at Franeker on 7 May 1622 and delivered a discourse on the occasion on &quot;Urim and Thummim&quot;. 
He brought renown to Franeker as professor, preacher, pastor and theological writer; one student of the period influenced by Ames was Johannes Cocceius. 
Another student was Nathaniel Eaton, later of Harvard College.

He prepared his &quot;Medulla Theologiae&quot; (The Marrow of Theology), a manual of Calvinistic doctrine, for his students. Ames was much influenced in terms of method by Ramism, and opposed the residual teaching of Aristotle. His &quot;De Conscientia, ejus Jure et Casibus&quot; (1632), an attempt to bring Christian ethics into clear relation with particular cases of conduct and of conscience, was a new thing in Protestantism.

==Move to Rotterdam==
Having continued twelve years at Franeker (where he was rector in 1626), his health gave way, and he contemplated a move to New England. But another door was opened for him, with an invitation to Rotterdam. There he prepared his &quot;Fresh Suit against Ceremonies&quot;—the book which made Richard Baxter a Nonconformist. It sums up the issues between the Puritan school and that of Richard Hooker, and was posthumously published.

Having caught a cold from a flood which inundated his house, he died in November 1633, at the age of fifty-seven, apparently in needy circumstances. He left, by a second wife Joan Fletcher, two sons and a daughter, who emigrated to Massachusetts in 1637; the sons later returned to England; his daughter Ruth married in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Edmund Angier, and their son Samuel Angier later married in 1680 Hannah Oakes, the daughter of Urian Oakes.

==Influence==
His works, which the &quot;Biographia Britannica&quot; (1778) testifies were known over Europe, were collected at Amsterdam in five volumes. Only a small proportion was translated into English. Ames&#x27; thought was particularly influential in New England.

<text>Wole Soyinka (13 July 1934) is a Nigerian author, best known as a playwright and poet. He has written three novels, ten collections of short stories, seven poetry collection, twenty five plays and five memoirs. He also wrote two translated works and many articles and short stories for many newspapers and periodicals. He is widely regarded as one of Africa&#x27;s greatest writers and one of the world&#x27;s most important dramatists. He was awarded the 1986 Nobel Prize in Literature for his &quot;wide cultural perspective and poetic overtones fashioning the drama of existence&quot;.

Born into an Anglican Yoruba family in Aké, Abeokuta, Soyinka had a preparatory education at Government College, Ibadan and proceeded to the University College Ibadan. During his education, he founded the Pyrate Confraternity. Soyinka left Nigeria for England to study at the University of Leeds. During that period, he was the editor of the university&#x27;s magazine, &quot;The Eagle&quot;, before becoming a full-time author in the 1950s. At UK he started writing short stories and making records for the BBC lecture. He wrote many plays which were performed in radios and theatres in Nigeria and UK especially the Royal Court Theatre. In 1958 he married a British woman whom he had met in Leeds. In 1963, after the divorce of the first wife, he married a Nigerian librarian, and subsequently, Folake Doherty in 1989.

Many of Soyinka&#x27;s novels and plays are set in Nigeria. He also wrote many satirical pieces, which he used to appeal to a wide public and sold in large numbers. He is also a poet; he did well in the writing poems and poetry collections. He achieved successes with his plays including &quot;The Swamp Dwellers&quot; (1958), &quot;The Lion and the Jewel&quot; (1959), and &quot;The Invention&quot;, which was one his early plays to be produced at the Royal Court Theatre. Soyinka wrote many works including &quot;The Interpreters&quot; (1965), &quot;Season of Anomy&quot; (1973), &quot;Chronicles from the Land of the Happiest People on Earth&quot;, and &quot;Harmattan Haze on an African Spring&quot;. In July 2024, Bola Tinubu renamed the National Arts Theatre after Soyinka during his 90th birthday.

==Life==
===Early life===

Soyinka was the son of Samuel Ayodele Soyinka, an Anglican minister and headmaster at St Peter&#x27;s Primary School, and Grace Soyinka (née Jenkins-Harrison), a shopkeeper and activist, who was a member of the Ransome-Kuti family. He was born in Ake, Abeokuta, where he was raised as a Christian. He was born on 13 July 1934, and was the second of seven children: Atinuke Aina, Femi, Yeside, Omofolabo Ajayi, and Kayode. 

Soyinka was educated at St. Peters Primary School, where his father was the headmaster, from 1940 to 1946. He had his secondary education at Abeokuta Grammar School and university preparatory studies at Government College, Ibadan from 1946 to 1951. He was admitted into the University College Ibadan, where he studied English literature, Greek, and Western history from 1952 to 1954. During his final years in the university, he wrote &quot;Keffi&#x27;s Birthday Treat&quot;, a short radio play for the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria, which was broadcast in July 1954. Along with his classmates including Olumuyiwa Awẹ, Ralph Opara, Aig-Imoukhuede, and Pius Olegbe, Soyinka founded the National Association of Seadogs, the first confraternity in Nigeria.

Soyinka relocated from Nigeria to England and continued his studies in English literature at University of Leeds from 1954 to 1957 under the supervision of under G. Wilson Knight. He graduated in 1958. At Leeds, he served as the editor of the university&#x27;s satirical magazine, &quot;The Eagle&quot;, which he wrote a column on academic life and often criticised his university peers. In August 1955 he had started recording for BBC lecture. He also wrote many short stories, which in 1957, he won the annual oratory competition run by the University.

===Writing and publishing===

Soyinka remained in Leeds working for his MA degree. He wrote and published his first play &quot;The Swamp Dwellers&quot; in 1958. A year later, he published another play &quot;The Lion and the Jewel&quot;. The play is a comedy and because it attracted interest from many members of London&#x27;s Royal Court Theatre, Soyinka had to move to London. He worked as a play reader for the Royal Court Theatre. During that period, his two plays were performed in Ibadan, Nigeria since they explored the difficult relationship between progress and tradition in Nigeria. In 1957, his play &quot;The Invention&quot; was produced at the Royal Court Theatre, and was his first work to achieve that fame. He wrote poems including &quot;The Immigrant&quot; and &quot;My Next Door Neighbour&quot;, which appeared in &quot;Black Orpheus&quot;. Soyinka returned to Nigeria after he received a Rockefeller Research Fellowship for his research on African theatre. In November 1959, he replaced Janheinz Jahn as the co-editor of &quot;Black Orpheus&quot; as well as produced &quot;The Trials of Brother Jero&quot;, which premiere in the Mellanby Hall of University College Ibadan, in April 1960. In the same year, his work &quot;A Dance of The Forest&quot;, became the official play for the Nigerian Independence Day and on 1 October 1960, it premiered in Lagos.

Soyinka wrote his first full-length play entitled &quot;My Father&#x27;s Burden&quot;. It was directed by Olusegun Olusola and featured on Western Nigeria Television on 6 August 1960. With the Rockefeller grant, Soyinka bought a Land Rover, and he began travelling throughout Nigeria as a researcher from the English Language department the University College Ibadan. In a 1960 essay by Soyinka, he criticised Leopold Senghor&#x27;s Négritude movement as &quot;a nostalgic and indiscriminate glorification of black African&#x27;s past that ignores the potential benefits of modernisation&quot;. He wrote essays that defended Nigerian literacy, among them, &quot;Death and the King&#x27;s Horsemen&quot;, and &quot;Towards a True Theater&quot; (1962), which was published by &quot;Transition Magazine&quot;. 

A lecturer at Obafemi Awolowo University in Ifẹ, Soyinka discussed current affairs with negrophiles and on several occasions, openly condemned the government censorship. At the end of 1963, his first feature-length movie, &quot;Culture in Transition&quot;, was released. In 1965 his book, &quot;The Interpreters&quot;, was published in London by André Deutsch. Along other professionals, Soyinka founded the Drama Association of Nigeria. In 1964 he resigned from his university post, as a protest against imposed pro-government behaviour by the authorities. In 1965, he was arrested for the first time, charged with holding up a radio station at gunpoint, which he would later write in his 2006 memoir, &quot;You Must Set Forth at Dawn&quot;, and replacing the tape of a recorded speech by the premier of Western Region with a different tape containing accusations of electoral malpractice. He was released after some months of confinement, as a result of protests by the international community of writers. In same year he wrote two more dramatic pieces &quot;Before the Blackout&quot; and &quot;Kongi&#x27;s Harvest.&quot; He also wrote &quot;The Detainee&quot;, a radio play for BBC in London. His play &quot;The Road&quot; premiered in London at the Commonwealth Arts Festival on 14 September 1965, at the Theatre Royal Stratford East. Soyinka was promoted to senior lecturer in the department of English language of University of Lagos.

===Marriage and teaching ===
In 1958 Soyinka married British writer Barbara Dixon, whom he met while studying at the University of Leeds in the 1950s. The couple gave birth to a male and female child; Olaokun and Morenike respectively. After they separated, he married in 1963 to a Nigerian librarian Olaide Idowu. They had three daughters: Moremi, Iyetade (1965–2013), Peyibomi and a son, Ilemakin. Soyinka also married Folake Doherty in 1989 and had three sons: Tunlewa, Bojode and Eniara.

From 1975 to 1999, Soyinka served as a Professor of Comparative literature at Obafemi Awolowo University. In the US, he taught at Cornell University as the Goldwin Smith professor for African Studies and Theatre Arts from 1988 to 1991. At Emory University, he was appointed Robert W. Woodruff Professor of the Arts in 1996 and has been a Professor of Creative Writing at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Soyinka served as scholar-in-residence at New York University&#x27;s Institute of African American Affairs and at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, California. He has also taught at the universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard and Yale. He was a Distinguished Scholar in Residence at Duke University in 2008.

In December 2017, Soyinka received the Europe Theatre Prize in the &quot;Special Prize&quot; category, awarded to someone who has &quot;contributed to the realization of cultural events that promote understanding and the exchange of knowledge between peoples&quot;.

===Civil war and imprisonment===
After becoming Chair of Drama at the University of Ibadan, Soyinka became more politically active. Following the military coup of January 1966, he secretly met with Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, the military governor in the Southeastern Nigeria in an effort to avert the Nigerian civil war.
Soyinka was subsequently arrested by federal authorities and imprisoned for 22 months, as civil war ensued between the Federal government of Nigeria and the secessionist state of Biafra. He wrote a significant body of poems and notes criticising the Nigerian government while in prison.

Despite his imprisonment, his play &quot;The Lion and The Jewel&quot; was produced in Accra, Ghana, in September 1967. In November that year, &quot;The Trials of Brother Jero&quot; and &quot;The Strong Breed&quot; were produced in the Greenwich Mews Theatre in New York City. Soyinka also published a collection of his poetry, &quot;Idanre and Other Poems&quot;, which was inspired by his visit to the sanctuary of the Yorùbá deity Ogun, whom he regards as his &quot;companion&quot; deity, kindred spirit, and protector.

In 1968, the Negro Ensemble Company in New York produced &quot;Kongi&#x27;s Harvest&quot;. While still imprisoned, Soyinka translated from Yoruba a fantastical novel by his compatriot D. O. Fagunwa, entitled &quot;The Forest of a Thousand Demons: A Hunter&#x27;s Saga&quot;.

Two films about this period of his life have been announced: &quot;The Man Died&quot;, directed by Awam Amkpa, a feature film based on a fictionalized form of Soyinka&#x27;s 1973 prison memoirs of the same name; and &quot;Ebrohimie Road&quot;, written and directed by Kola Tubosun, which takes a look at the house where Soyinka lived between 1967 – when he arrived back in Ibadan to take on the directorship of the School of Drama – and 1972, when he left for exile after being released from prison.

===Release and literary production===
In October 1969, when the civil war came to an end, amnesty was proclaimed, and Soyinka and other political prisoners were freed. For the first few months after his release, Soyinka stayed at a friend&#x27;s farm in southern France, where he sought solitude. He wrote &quot;The Bacchae of Euripides&quot; (1969), a reworking of the Pentheus myth. He soon published in London a book of poetry, &quot;Poems from Prison&quot;. At the end of the year, he returned to his office as Chair of Drama at Ibadan.

In 1970, he produced the play &quot;Kongi&#x27;s Harvest&quot;, while simultaneously adapting it as a film of the same title. In June 1970, he finished another play, called &quot;Madmen and Specialists&quot;. Together with the group of 15 actors of Ibadan University Theatre Art Company, he went on a trip to the United States, to the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Memorial Theatre Center in Waterford, Connecticut, where his latest play premiered. It gave them all experience with theatrical production in another English-speaking country.

In 1971, his poetry collection &quot;A Shuttle in the Crypt&quot; was published. &quot;Madmen and Specialists&quot; was produced in Ibadan that year. In April 1971, concerned about the political situation in Nigeria, Soyinka resigned from his duties at the University in Ibadan, and began years of voluntary exile.

Soyinka travelled to Paris, France, to take the lead role as Patrice Lumumba, the murdered first Prime Minister of the Republic of the Congo, in Joan Littlewood&#x27;s May 1971 production of &quot;Murderous Angels&quot;, Conor Cruise O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s play about the Congo Crisis. In July in Paris, excerpts from Soyinka&#x27;s well-known play &quot;The Dance of The Forests&quot; were performed.

In 1972, his novel &quot;Season of Anomy&quot; and his &quot;Collected Plays&quot; were both published by Oxford University Press. His powerful autobiographical work &quot;The Man Died&quot;, a collection of notes from prison, was also published that year. He was awarded an Honoris Causa doctorate by the University of Leeds in 1973. In the same year the National Theatre, London, commissioned and premiered the play &quot;The Bacchae of Euripides&quot;, and his plays &quot;Camwood on the Leaves&quot; and &quot;Jero&#x27;s Metamorphosis&quot; were also first published. From 1973 to 1975, Soyinka spent time on scientific studies. He spent a year as a visiting fellow at Churchill College, Cambridge (1973–74) and wrote &quot;Death and the King&#x27;s Horseman&quot;, which had its first reading at Churchill College.

In 1974, Oxford University Press issued his &quot;Collected Plays, Volume II&quot;. In 1975, Soyinka was promoted to the position of editor for &quot;Transition Magazine&quot;, which was based in the Ghanaian capital of Accra, where he moved for some time. He used his columns in the magazine to criticise the &quot;negrophiles&quot; (for instance, his article &quot;Neo-Tarzanism: The Poetics of Pseudo-Transition&quot;) and military regimes. He protested against the military junta of Idi Amin in Uganda. After the political turnover in Nigeria and the subversion of Gowon&#x27;s military regime in 1975, Soyinka returned to his homeland and resumed his position as Chair of Comparative Literature at the University of Ife.

In 1976, he published his poetry collection &quot;Ogun Abibiman&quot;, as well as a collection of essays entitled &quot;Myth, Literature and the African World&quot;. In these, Soyinka explores the genesis of mysticism in African theatre and, using examples from both European and African literature, compares and contrasts the cultures. He delivered a series of guest lectures at the Institute of African Studies at the University of Ghana in Legon. In October, the French version of &quot;The Dance of The Forests&quot; was performed in Dakar, while in Ife, his play &quot;Death and The King&#x27;s Horseman&quot; premièred.

In 1977, &quot;Opera Wọnyọsi&quot;, his adaptation of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, was staged in Ibadan. In 1979 he both directed and acted in Jon Blair and Norman Fenton&#x27;s drama &quot;The Biko Inquest&quot;, a work based on the life of Steve Biko, a South African student and human rights activist who was beaten to death by apartheid police forces. In 1981 Soyinka published his autobiographical work &quot;Aké: The Years of Childhood&quot;, which won a 1983 Anisfield-Wolf Book Award.

Soyinka founded another theatrical group called the Guerrilla Unit. Its goal was to work with local communities in analysing their problems and to express some of their grievances in dramatic sketches. In 1983 his play &quot;Requiem for a Futurologist&quot; had its first performance at the University of Ife. In July, one of his musical projects, the Unlimited Liability Company, issued a long-playing record entitled &quot;I Love My Country&quot;, on which several prominent Nigerian musicians played songs composed by Soyinka. In 1984, he directed the film &quot;Blues for a Prodigal&quot;, which was screened at the University of Ife. His &quot;A Play of Giants&quot; was produced the same year.

During the years 1975–84, Soyinka was more politically active. At the University of Ife, his administrative duties included the security of public roads. He criticized the corruption in the government of the democratically elected President Shehu Shagari. When Shagari was replaced by the army general Muhammadu Buhari, Soyinka was often at odds with the military. In 1984, a Nigerian court banned his 1972 book &quot;The Man Died: Prison Notes&quot;. In 1985, his play &quot;Requiem for a Futurologist&quot; was published in London by Rex Collings.

===Later years===

Soyinka was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1986, becoming the first African laureate. He was described as one &quot;who in a wide cultural perspective and with poetic overtones fashions the drama of existence&quot;. Reed Way Dasenbrock writes that the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Soyinka is &quot;likely to prove quite controversial and thoroughly deserved&quot;. He also notes that &quot;it is the first Nobel Prize awarded to an African writer or to any writer from the &#x27;new literatures&#x27; in English that have emerged in the former colonies of the British Empire.&quot; His Nobel acceptance speech, &quot;This Past Must Address Its Present&quot;, was devoted to South African freedom-fighter Nelson Mandela. Soyinka&#x27;s speech was an outspoken criticism of apartheid and the politics of racial segregation imposed on the majority by the National South African government. In 1986, he received the Agip Prize for Literature.

In 1988, his collection of poems &quot;Mandela&#x27;s Earth, and Other Poems&quot; was published, while in Nigeria another collection of essays, entitled &quot;Art, Dialogue and Outrage: Essays on Literature and Culture&quot;, appeared. In the same year, Soyinka accepted the position of Professor of African Studies and Theatre at Cornell University. In 1989, a third novel, inspired by his father&#x27;s intellectual circle, &quot;Ìsarà: A Voyage Around Essay&quot;, appeared. In July 1991 the BBC African Service transmitted his radio play &quot;A Scourge of Hyacinths&quot;, and the next year (1992) in Siena (Italy), his play &quot;From Zia with Love&quot; had its premiere. Both works are very bitter political parodies, based on events that took place in Nigeria in the 1980s. In 1993 Soyinka was awarded an honorary doctorate from Harvard University. The following year, another part of his autobiography appeared: &quot;Ibadan: The Penkelemes Years (A Memoir: 1946–1965)&quot;. In 1995, his play, &quot;The Beatification of Area Boy,&quot; was published. In October 1994, he was appointed UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador for the Promotion of African culture, human rights, freedom of expression, media and communication.

In November 1994, Soyinka fled from Nigeria on a motorcycle via the border with Benin, and then went to the United States. In 1996, his book &quot;The Open Sore of a Continent: A Personal Narrative of the Nigerian Crisis,&quot; was first published. In 1997, he was charged with treason by the government of General Sani Abacha. The International Parliament of Writers (IPW) was established in 1993 to provide support for writers victimized by persecution. Soyinka became the organization&#x27;s second president from 1997 to 2000. In 1999 a new volume of poems by Soyinka, entitled &quot;Outsiders&quot;, was released. That same year, a BBC-commissioned play called &quot;Document of Identity&quot; aired on BBC Radio 3, telling the lightly-fictionalized story of the problems his daughter&#x27;s family encountered during a stopover in Britain when they fled Nigeria for the US in 1996; her son, Oseoba Airewele was born in Luton and became a stateless person.

Soyinka&#x27;s play &quot;King Baabu&quot; premièred in Lagos in 2001, a political satire on the theme of African dictatorship. In 2002, a collection of his poems entitled &quot;Samarkand and Other Markets I Have Known&quot; was published by Methuen. In April 2006, his memoir &quot;You Must Set Forth at Dawn&quot; was published by Random House. In 2006 he cancelled his keynote speech for the annual S.E.A. Write Awards Ceremony in Bangkok to protest the Thai military&#x27;s successful coup against the government.

In April 2007, Soyinka called for the cancellation of the Nigerian presidential elections held two weeks earlier, beset by widespread fraud and violence. In the wake of the attempting bombing on a Northwest Airlines flight to the United States by a Nigerian student who had become radicalised in Britain, Soyinka questioned the British government&#x27;s social logic in allowing every religion to openly proselytise their faith, asserting that it was being abused by religious fundamentalists, thereby turning England into, in his view, a cesspit for the breeding of extremism. He supported the freedom of worship but warned against the consequence of the illogic of allowing religions to preach apocalyptic violence.

In August 2014, Soyinka delivered a recording of his speech &quot;From Chibok with Love&quot; to the World Humanist Congress in Oxford, hosted by the International Humanist and Ethical Union and the British Humanist Association. The Congress theme was &quot;Freedom of thought and expression: Forging a 21st Century Enlightenment&quot;. He was awarded the 2014 International Humanist Award. He served as scholar-in-residence at NYU&#x27;s Institute of African American Affairs.

Soyinka opposes allowing Fulani herdsmen the ability to graze their cattle on open land in southern, Christian-dominated Nigeria and believes these herdsmen should be declared terrorists to enable the restriction of their movements.

In December 2020, Soyinka described 2020 as the most challenging year in the nation&#x27;s history, saying: &quot;With the turbulence that characterised year 2020, and as activities wind down, the mood has been repugnant and very negative. I don&#x27;t want to sound pessimistic but this is one of the most pessimistic years I have known in this nation and it wasn&#x27;t just because of COVID-19. Natural disasters had happened elsewhere, but how have you managed to take such in their strides?&quot;

September 2021 saw the publication of &quot;Chronicles from the Land of the Happiest People on Earth&quot;, Soyinka&#x27;s first novel in almost 50 years, described in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; as &quot;a brutally satirical look at power and corruption in Nigeria, told in the form of a whodunnit involving three university friends.&quot; Reviewing the book in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Ben Okri said: &quot;It is Soyinka&#x27;s greatest novel, his revenge against the insanities of the nation&#x27;s ruling class and one of the most shocking chronicles of an African nation in the 21st century. It ought to be widely read.&quot;

The film adaptation by Biyi Bandele of Soyinka&#x27;s 1975 stage play &quot;Death and the King&#x27;s Horseman&quot;, co-produced by Netflix and Ebonylife TV, titled &quot;Elesin Oba, The King&#x27;s Horseman&quot;, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in September 2022. It is Soyinka&#x27;s first work to be made into a feature film, and the first Yoruba-language film to premiere at TIFF.

===Religion===
In November 2022, during a public presentation of his two-volume collection of essays, Soyinka said in relation to religion:

&quot;Do I really need one (religion)? I have never felt I needed one. I am a mythologist... No, I don&#x27;t worship any deity. But I consider deities as creatively real and therefore my companions in my journey in both the real world and the imaginative world.&quot;

Around July 2023, Soyinka came under severe criticism, after writing an open letter to the Emir of Ilorin, Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari, over the cancellation of the Isese festival proposed by an &quot;Osun&quot; priestess, Omolara Olatunji.

===Controversy ===
In a book published in 2020, University College London academic Caroline Davis examined archival evidence of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) funding of African authors in the post-independence period. One chapter of the book, titled &quot;Wole Soyinka, the Transcription Centre, and the CIA&quot;, focused specifically on Soyinka&#x27;s receipt of funding from CIA front organisations such as the Farfield Foundation and the Transcription Centre. The funding supported Soyinka&#x27;s publishing and the global production of some of his theatre plays. The book states that even after the CIA&#x27;s covert role in some of these initiatives was revealed in the 1960s, Soyinka had &quot;unusually close ties to the US government even to the point of frequently meeting with US intelligence in the late 1970s&quot;.

When the book was published Soyinka vociferously denied having been a CIA agent and stated that he would &quot;[follow the authors] to the end of the earth and to the pit of hell until I get a retraction&quot;. 

Nigerian academic Adekeye Adebajo has argued in the &quot;Johannesburg Review of Books&quot; that Davis does not directly accuse Soyinka of being a CIA agent and as a result Soyinka&#x27;s denials are also misdirected. Adebajo states that, &quot;Any suggestion that Soyinka was also a pro-American agent would not be borne out by his political activism, which frequently condemned US-supported Cold War clients.&quot; However he also suggests that &quot;for all his eloquent fervour, Soyinka has not rebutted these allegations in the detailed, evidence-based manner that could have put an end to this debate&quot;.

Scholars, including Adeniran, has noted that Soyinka’s writings reflect his life.

===Wole Soyinka Annual Lecture Series===
The Wole Soyinka Annual Lecture Series was founded in 1994. It is dedicated &quot;to honouring one of Nigeria and Africa&#x27;s most outstanding and enduring literary icons: Wole Soyinka&quot;. It is organised by the National Association of Seadogs.
In 2011, the African Heritage Research Library and Cultural Centre built a writers&#x27; enclave in his honour. It is located in Adeyipo Village, Lagelu Local Government Area, Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. The enclave includes a Writer-in-Residence Programme that enables writers to stay for a period of two, three or six months, engaging in serious creative writing. In 2013, he visited the Benin Moat as the representative of UNESCO in recognition of the Naija seven Wonders project. He is currently the consultant for the Lagos Black Heritage Festival, with the Lagos State deeming him as the only person who could bring out the aims and objectives of the Festival to the people. He was appointed a patron of Humanists UK in 2020.

In 2014, the collection &quot;Crucible of the Ages: Essays in Honour of Wole Soyinka at 80&quot;, edited by Ivor Agyeman-Duah and Ogochwuku Promise, was published by Bookcraft in Nigeria and Ayebia Clarke Publishing in the UK, with tributes and contributions from Nadine Gordimer, Toni Morrison, Ama Ata Aidoo, Ngugi wa Thiong&#x27;o, Henry Louis Gates, Jr, Margaret Busby, Kwame Anthony Appiah, Ali Mazrui, Sefi Atta, and others.

In 2018, Henry Louis Gates, Jr tweeted that Nigerian filmmaker and writer Onyeka Nwelue visited him in Harvard and was making a documentary film on Wole Soyinka. As part of efforts to mark his 84th birthday, a collection of poems titled &quot;84 Delicious Bottles of Wine&quot; was published for Wole Soyinka, edited by Onyeka Nwelue and Odega Shawa. Among the notable contributors was Adamu Usman Garko, award-winning teenage essayist, poet and writer.
===Critical reputation===
===Awards and honors===

Soyinka won the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award in 1983 and 2013. He rejected an honorary degree from the University of Ibadan. In 1986 he won the Nobel Prize for Literature, Agip Prize for Literature. He was also confered the Commander of the Order of the Federal Republic by the military head of state, Ibrahim Babangida. Soyinka is a tribal aristocrat; one vested with the right to use the Yoruba title Oloye as a pre-nominal honorific. In 2005, he was given a chieftaincy title as the &quot;Akinlatun&quot; of Egbaland. He was honored with the Golden Plate Award by the American Academy of Achievement. It was presented to him by the Awards Council member, Archbishop Desmond Tutu at St. George&#x27;s Cathedral, Cape Town.

In 2018 his almamater, University of Ibadan, renamed her arts theatre as Wole Soyinka Theatre. In 2017, he received the Special Prize category of the Europe Theatre Prize, in Rome. In August 2024, the President of Cuba, Miguel Diaz-Canel, honoured the Soyinka with the Haydée Santamaría medal.

<text>A white Russian is a cocktail made with vodka, coffee liqueur (e.g. Kahlúa or Tia Maria) and cream served with ice in an old fashioned glass.

==History==
The traditional cocktail known as a black Russian, which first appeared in 1949, becomes a white Russian with the addition of cream. Neither drink has any known Russian origin, but both are so-named due to vodka being the primary ingredient. It is unclear which drink preceded the other.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; refers to the first mention of &quot;white Russian&quot; in the sense of a cocktail as appearing in California&#x27;s &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; on November 21, 1965. It was placed in the newspaper as an insert: &quot;White Russian. 1 oz. each Southern, vodka, cream&quot;, with &quot;Southern&quot; referring to Coffee Southern, a short-lived brand of coffee liqueur by Southern Comfort.

The white Russian saw a surge in popularity after the 1998 release of the film &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;. Throughout the movie, it appears as the beverage of choice for the protagonist, Jeffrey &quot;The Dude&quot; Lebowski. On a number of occasions he refers to the drink as a &quot;Caucasian&quot;.

==Preparation==

As with all cocktails, various modes of preparation exist, varying according to the recipes and styles of particular bars or mixologists. Most common varieties have adjusted amounts of vodka or coffee liqueur, or mixed brands of coffee liqueur. Shaking the cream in order to thicken it prior to pouring it over the drink is also common. Sometimes the drink is prepared on the stove with hot coffee for a warm treat on cold days. Conversely, vanilla ice cream has been known to be used, rather than cream, to make it frozen.

===Variations===

Many variants of the cocktail exist, such as a mudslide, Bolshevik, or blonde Russian (made with Irish cream), an Anna Kournikova (named after the tennis player, made with skimmed milk, i.e. a &quot;skinny&quot; white Russian), a white Cuban (made with rum instead of vodka), a black Russian (vodka and coffee liqueur), or a dirty Russian (with chocolate syrup added). A Colorado bulldog or tall black Russian adds a splash of cola. A white Mexican substitutes tequila for vodka.
