<text>Carmen () is an opera in four acts by the French composer Georges Bizet. The libretto was written by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy, based on the novella of the same title by Prosper Mérimée. The opera was first performed by the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 3 March 1875, where its breaking of conventions shocked and scandalised its first audiences. Bizet died suddenly after the 33rd performance, unaware that the work would achieve international acclaim within the following ten years. &quot;Carmen&quot; has since become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas in the classical canon; the &quot;Habanera&quot; and &quot;Seguidilla&quot; from act 1 and the &quot;Toreador Song&quot; from act 2 are among the best known of all operatic arias.

The opera is written in the genre of &quot;opéra comique&quot; with musical numbers separated by dialogue. It is set in southern Spain and tells the story of the downfall of Don José, a naïve soldier who is seduced by the wiles of the fiery gypsy Carmen. José abandons his childhood sweetheart and deserts from his military duties, yet loses Carmen&#x27;s love to the glamorous torero Escamillo, after which José kills her in a jealous rage. The depictions of proletarian life, immorality, and lawlessness, and the tragic death of the main character on stage, broke new ground in French opera and were highly controversial.

After the premiere, most reviews were critical, and the French public was generally indifferent. &quot;Carmen&quot; initially gained its reputation through a series of productions outside France, and was not revived in Paris until 1883. Thereafter, it rapidly acquired popularity at home and abroad. Later commentators have asserted that &quot;Carmen&quot; forms the bridge between the tradition of &quot;opéra comique&quot; and the realism or &quot;verismo&quot; that characterised late 19th-century Italian opera.

The music of &quot;Carmen&quot; has since been widely acclaimed for brilliance of melody, harmony, atmosphere, and orchestration, and for the skill with which the emotions and suffering of the characters are represented. At his death Bizet was still in the midst of revising his score and because of other later changes (notably the introduction of recitatives composed by Ernest Guiraud in place of the original dialogue) there is still no definitive edition of the opera. The opera has been recorded many times since the first acoustical recording in 1908, and the story has been the subject of many screen and stage adaptations.

==Background==

In the Paris of the 1860s, despite being a laureate, Bizet struggled to get his stage works performed. The capital&#x27;s two main state-funded opera houses—the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique—followed conservative repertoires that restricted opportunities for young native talent. Bizet&#x27;s professional relationship with Léon Carvalho, manager of the independent Théâtre Lyrique company, enabled him to bring to the stage two full-scale operas, &quot;Les pêcheurs de perles&quot; (1863) and &quot;La jolie fille de Perth&quot; (1867), but neither enjoyed much public success.

When artistic life in Paris resumed after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, Bizet found wider opportunities for the performance of his works; his one-act opera &quot;Djamileh&quot; opened at the Opéra-Comique in May 1872. Although this failed and was withdrawn after 11 performances, it led to a further commission from the theatre, this time for a full-length opera for which Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy would provide the libretto. Halévy, who had written the text for Bizet&#x27;s student opera &quot;Le docteur Miracle&quot; (1856), was a cousin of Bizet&#x27;s wife, Geneviève; he and Meilhac had a solid reputation as the librettists of many of Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s operettas.

Bizet was delighted with the Opéra-Comique commission, and expressed to his friend Edmund Galabert his satisfaction in &quot;the absolute certainty of having found my path&quot;. The subject of the projected work was a matter of discussion between composer, librettists and the Opéra-Comique management; Adolphe de Leuven, on behalf of the theatre, made several suggestions that were politely rejected. It was Bizet who first proposed an adaptation of Prosper Mérimée&#x27;s novella &quot;Carmen&quot;. Mérimée&#x27;s story is a blend of travelogue and adventure yarn, possibly inspired by the writer&#x27;s lengthy travels in Spain in 1830, and had originally been published in 1845 in the journal &quot;Revue des deux Mondes&quot;. It may have been influenced in part by Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s 1824 poem &quot;The Gypsies&quot;, a work Mérimée had translated into French; it has also been suggested that the story was developed from an incident told to Mérimée by his friend the Countess Montijo. Bizet may first have encountered the story during his Rome sojourn of 1858–60, since his journals record Mérimée as one of the writers whose works he absorbed in those years.

==Roles==

==Instrumentation==
The orchestration consists of two flutes (doubling piccolo), two oboes (the second doubling cor anglais), two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, harp, and strings. The percussion section consists of timpani, side drum, triangle, tambourine, cymbals, castanets, and bass drum. The orchestral complement for the premiere run was 62 or 57 musicians in total (depending on whether the pit trumpet and trombone players doubled off-stage music).

==Synopsis==

:Place: Seville, Spain, and surrounding hills
:Time: Around 1820

===Act 1===

&quot;A square, in Seville. On the right, a door to the tobacco factory. At the back, a bridge. On the left, a guardhouse.&quot;

A group of soldiers relax in the square, waiting for the changing of the guard and commenting on the passers-by (&quot;Sur la place, chacun passe&quot;). Micaëla appears, seeking José. Moralès tells her that &quot;José is not yet on duty&quot; and invites her to wait with them. She declines, saying she will return later. José arrives with the new guard, which is greeted and imitated by a crowd of urchins (&quot;Avec la garde montante&quot;).
As the factory bell rings, the cigarette girls emerge and exchange banter with young men in the crowd (&quot;La cloche a sonné&quot;). Carmen enters and sings her provocative habanera on the untameable nature of love (&quot;L&#x27;amour est un oiseau rebelle&quot;). The men plead with her to choose a lover, and after some teasing she throws a flower to Don José, who thus far has been ignoring her but is now annoyed by her insolence.

As the women go back to the factory, Micaëla returns and gives José a letter and a kiss from his mother (&quot;Parle-moi de ma mère!&quot;). He reads that his mother wants him to return home and marry Micaëla, who retreats in shy embarrassment on learning this. Just as José declares that he is ready to heed his mother&#x27;s wishes, the women stream from the factory in great agitation. Zuniga, the officer of the guard, learns that Carmen has attacked a woman with a knife. When challenged, Carmen answers with mocking defiance (&quot;Tra la la... Coupe-moi, brûle-moi&quot;); Zuniga orders José to tie her hands while he prepares the prison warrant. Left alone with José, Carmen beguiles him with a seguidilla, in which she sings of a night of dancing and passion with her lover—whoever that may be—in Lillas Pastia&#x27;s tavern. Confused yet mesmerised, José agrees to free her hands; as she is led away she pushes her escort to the ground and runs off laughing. José is arrested for dereliction of duty.

===Act 2===

&quot;Lillas Pastia&#x27;s Inn&quot;

Two months have passed. Carmen and her friends Frasquita and Mercédès are entertaining Zuniga and other officers (&quot;Les tringles des sistres tintaient&quot;) in Pastia&#x27;s inn. Carmen is delighted to learn of José&#x27;s release from two months&#x27; detention. Outside, a chorus and procession announces the arrival of the toreador Escamillo (&quot;Vivat, vivat le Toréro&quot;). Invited inside, he introduces himself with the &quot;Toreador Song&quot; (&quot;Votre toast, je peux vous le rendre&quot;) and sets his sights on Carmen, who brushes him aside. Lillas Pastia hustles the crowds and the soldiers away.

When only Carmen, Frasquita and Mercédès remain, smugglers Dancaïre and Remendado arrive and reveal their plans to dispose of some recently acquired contraband (&quot;Nous avons en tête une affaire&quot;). Frasquita and Mercédès are keen to help them, but Carmen refuses, since she wishes to wait for José. After the smugglers leave, José arrives. Carmen treats him to a private exotic dance (&quot;Je vais danser en votre honneur... La la la&quot;), but her song is joined by a distant bugle call from the barracks. When José says he must return to duty, she mocks him, and he answers by showing her the flower that she threw to him in the square (&quot;La fleur que tu m&#x27;avais jetée&quot;). Unconvinced, Carmen demands he show his love by leaving with her. José refuses to desert, but as he prepares to depart, Zuniga enters looking for Carmen. He and José fight. Carmen summons her gypsy comrades, who restrain Zuniga. Having attacked a superior officer, José now has no choice but to join Carmen and the smugglers (&quot;Suis-nous à travers la campagne&quot;).

===Act 3===
&quot;A wild spot in the mountains&quot;

Carmen and José enter with the smugglers and their booty (&quot;Écoute, écoute, compagnon&quot;); Carmen has now become bored with José and tells him scornfully that he should go back to his mother. Frasquita and Mercédès amuse themselves by reading their fortunes from the cards; Carmen joins them and finds that the cards are foretelling her death, and José&#x27;s. The smugglers depart to transport their goods while the women distract the local customs officers. José is left behind on guard duty.

Micaëla enters with a guide, seeking José and determined to rescue him from Carmen (&quot;Je dis que rien ne m&#x27;épouvante&quot;). On hearing a gunshot she hides in fear; it is José, who has fired at an intruder who proves to be Escamillo. José&#x27;s pleasure at meeting the bullfighter turns to anger when Escamillo declares his infatuation with Carmen. The pair fight (&quot;Je suis Escamillo, toréro de Grenade&quot;), but are interrupted by the returning smugglers and girls (&quot;Holà, holà José&quot;). As Escamillo leaves he invites everyone to his next bullfight in Seville. Micaëla is discovered; at first, José will not leave with her despite Carmen&#x27;s mockery, but he agrees to go when told that his mother is dying. He departs, vowing he will return. Escamillo is heard in the distance, singing the toreador&#x27;s song.

===Act 4===

&quot;A square in Seville. At the back, the walls of an ancient amphitheatre&quot;

Zuniga, Frasquita and Mercédès are among the crowd awaiting the arrival of the bullfighters (&quot;Les voici! Voici la quadrille!&quot;). Escamillo enters with Carmen, and they express their mutual love (&quot;Si tu m&#x27;aimes, Carmen&quot;). As Escamillo goes into the arena, Frasquita and Mercédès warn Carmen that José is nearby, but Carmen is unafraid and willing to speak to him. Alone, she is confronted by the desperate José (&quot;C&#x27;est toi!&quot;, &quot;C&#x27;est moi!&quot;). While he pleads vainly for her to return to him, cheers are heard from the arena. As José makes his last entreaty, Carmen contemptuously throws down the ring he gave her and attempts to enter the arena. He then stabs her, and as Escamillo is acclaimed by the crowds, Carmen dies. José kneels and sings &quot;Ah! Carmen! ma Carmen adorée!&quot;; as the crowd exits the arena, José confesses to killing Carmen.

===Writing history===

Meilhac and Halévy were a long-standing duo with an established division of labour: Meilhac, who was completely unmusical, wrote the dialogue and Halévy the verses. There is no clear indication of when work began on &quot;Carmen&quot;. Bizet and the two librettists were all in Paris during 1873 and easily able to meet; thus there is little written record or correspondence relating to the beginning of the collaboration. The libretto was prepared in accordance with the conventions of &quot;opéra comique&quot;, with dialogue separating musical numbers. It deviates from Mérimée&#x27;s novella in a number of significant respects. In the original, events are spread over a much longer period of time, and much of the main story is narrated by José from his prison cell, as he awaits execution for Carmen&#x27;s murder. Micaëla does not feature in Mérimée&#x27;s version, and the Escamillo character is peripheral—a picador named Lucas who is only briefly Carmen&#x27;s grand passion. Carmen has a husband called Garcia, whom José kills during a quarrel. In the novella, Carmen and José are presented much less sympathetically than they are in the opera; Bizet&#x27;s biographer Mina Curtiss comments that Mérimée&#x27;s Carmen, on stage, would have seemed &quot;an unmitigated and unconvincing monster, had her character not been simplified and deepened&quot;.

With rehearsals due to begin in October 1873, Bizet began composing in or around January of that year, and by the summer had completed the music for the first act and perhaps sketched more. At that point, according to Bizet&#x27;s biographer Winton Dean, &quot;some hitch at the Opéra-Comique intervened&quot;, and the project was suspended for a while. One reason for the delay may have been the difficulties in finding a singer for the title role. Another was a split that developed between the joint directors of the theatre, Camille du Locle and Adolphe de Leuven, over the advisability of staging the work. De Leuven had vociferously opposed the entire notion of presenting so risqué a story in what he considered a family theatre and was sure audiences would be frightened away. He was assured by Halévy that the story would be toned down, that Carmen&#x27;s character would be softened, and offset by Micaëla, described by Halévy as &quot;a very innocent, very chaste young girl&quot;. Furthermore, the gypsies would be presented as comic characters, and Carmen&#x27;s death would be overshadowed at the end by &quot;triumphal processions, ballets and joyous fanfares&quot;. De Leuven reluctantly agreed, but his continuing hostility towards the project led to his resignation from the theatre early in 1874.
After the various delays, Bizet appears to have resumed work on &quot;Carmen&quot; early in 1874. He completed the draft of the composition—1,200 pages of music—in the summer, which he spent at the artists&#x27; colony at Bougival, just outside Paris. He was pleased with the result, informing a friend: &quot;I have written a work that is all clarity and vivacity, full of colour and melody.&quot; During the period of rehearsals, which began in October, Bizet repeatedly altered the music—sometimes at the request of the orchestra who found some of it impossible to perform, sometimes to meet the demands of individual singers, and otherwise in response to the demands of the theatre&#x27;s management. The vocal score that Bizet published in March 1875 shows significant changes from the version of the score he sold the publishers, , in January 1875; the conducting score used at the premiere differs from each of these documents. There is no definitive edition, and there are differences among musicologists about which version represents the composer&#x27;s true intentions. Bizet also changed the libretto, reordering sequences and imposing his own verses where he felt the librettists had strayed too far from the character of Mérimée&#x27;s original. Among other changes, he provided new words for Carmen&#x27;s &quot;Habanera&quot;, and rewrote the text of Carmen&#x27;s solo in the act 3 card scene. He also provided a new opening line for the &quot;Seguidilla&quot; in act 1.

===Characterisation===
Most of the characters in &quot;Carmen&quot;—the soldiers, the smugglers, the Gypsy women and the secondary leads Micaëla and Escamillo—are reasonably familiar types within the &quot;opéra comique&quot; tradition, although drawing them from proletarian life was unusual. The two principals, José and Carmen, lie outside the genre. While each is presented quite differently from Mérimée&#x27;s portrayals of a murderous brigand and a treacherous, amoral schemer, even in their relatively sanitised forms neither corresponds to the norms of &quot;opéra comique&quot;. They are more akin to the &quot;verismo&quot; style that would find fuller expression in the works of Puccini.

Dean considers that José is the central figure of the opera: &quot;It is his fate rather than Carmen&#x27;s that interests us.&quot; The music characterises his gradual decline, act by act, from honest soldier to deserter, vagabond and finally murderer. In act 1 he is a simple countryman aligned musically with Micaëla; in act 2 he evinces a greater toughness, the result of his experiences as a prisoner, but it is clear that by the end of the act his infatuation with Carmen has driven his emotions beyond control. Dean describes him in act 3 as a trapped animal who refuses to leave his cage even when the door is opened for him, ravaged by a mix of conscience, jealousy and despair. In the final act his music assumes a grimness and purposefulness that reflects his new fatalism: &quot;He will make one more appeal; if Carmen refuses, he knows what to do.&quot;

Carmen herself, says Dean, is a new type of operatic heroine representing a new kind of love, not the innocent kind associated with the &quot;spotless soprano&quot; school, but something altogether more vital and dangerous. Her capriciousness, fearlessness and love of freedom are all musically represented: &quot;She is redeemed from any suspicion of vulgarity by her qualities of courage and fatalism so vividly realised in the music&quot;. Curtiss suggests that Carmen&#x27;s character, spiritually and musically, may be a realisation of the composer&#x27;s own unconscious longing for a freedom denied to him by his stifling marriage. Harold C. Schonberg likens Carmen to &quot;a female Don Giovanni. She would rather die than be false to herself.&quot; The dramatic personality of the character, and the range of moods she is required to express, call for exceptional acting and singing talents. This has deterred some of opera&#x27;s most distinguished exponents; Maria Callas, though she recorded the part, never performed it on stage. The musicologist Hugh Macdonald observes that &quot;French opera never produced another &quot;femme&quot; as &quot;fatale&quot; as Carmen&quot;, though she may have influenced some of Massenet&#x27;s heroines. Macdonald suggests that outside the French repertoire, Richard Strauss&#x27;s Salome and Alban Berg&#x27;s Lulu &quot;may be seen as distant degenerate descendants of Bizet&#x27;s temptress&quot;.

Bizet was reportedly contemptuous of the music he wrote for Escamillo: &quot;Well, they asked for ordure, and they&#x27;ve got it&quot;, he is said to have remarked about the toreador&#x27;s song—but, as Dean comments, &quot;the triteness lies in the character, not in the music&quot;. Micaëla&#x27;s music has been criticised for its &quot;Gounodesque&quot; elements, although Dean maintains that her music has greater vitality than that of any of Gounod&#x27;s own heroines.

==Performance history==

===Assembling the cast===
The search for a singer-actress to play Carmen began in the summer of 1873. Press speculation favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists&#x27; preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach&#x27;s operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to Célestine Galli-Marié, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months&#x27; negotiation. Galli-Marié, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.

The leading tenor part of Don José was given to Paul Lhérie, a rising star of the Opéra-Comique who had recently appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of &quot;Les pêcheurs de perles&quot;. Jacques Bouhy, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as Méphistophélès in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; and as Mozart&#x27;s Figaro. Marguerite Chapuy, who sang Micaëla, was at the beginning of a short career in which she was briefly a star at London&#x27;s Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; the impresario James H. Mapleson thought her &quot;one of the most charming vocalists it has been my pleasure to know&quot;. However, she married and left the stage altogether in 1876, refusing Mapleson&#x27;s considerable cash inducements to return.

===Premiere and initial run===
Because rehearsals did not start until October 1874 and lasted longer than anticipated, the premiere was delayed. The final rehearsals went well, and in a generally optimistic mood the first night was fixed for 3 March 1875, the day on which, coincidentally, Bizet&#x27;s appointment as a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour was formally announced. The premiere, which was conducted by Adolphe Deloffre, was attended by many of Paris&#x27;s leading musical figures, including Massenet, Offenbach, Delibes and Gounod; during the performance the last-named was overheard complaining bitterly that Bizet had stolen the music of Micaëla&#x27;s act 3 aria from him: &quot;That melody is mine!&quot; Halévy recorded his impressions of the premiere in a letter to a friend; the first act was evidently well received, with applause for the main numbers and numerous curtain calls. The first part of act 2 also went well, but after the toreador&#x27;s song there was, Halévy noted, &quot;coldness&quot;. In act 3 only Micaëla&#x27;s aria earned applause as the audience became increasingly disconcerted. The final act was &quot;glacial from first to last&quot;, and Bizet was left &quot;only with the consolations of a few friends&quot;. The critic Ernest Newman wrote later that the sentimentalist Opéra-Comique audience was &quot;shocked by the drastic realism of the action&quot; and by the low standing and defective morality of most of the characters. According to the composer Benjamin Godard, Bizet retorted, in response to a compliment, &quot;Don&#x27;t you see that all these bourgeois have not understood a wretched word of the work I have written for them?&quot; In a different vein, shortly after the work had concluded, Massenet sent Bizet a congratulatory note: &quot;How happy you must be at this time—it&#x27;s a great success!&quot;

The general tone of the next day&#x27;s press reviews ranged from disappointment to outrage. The more conservative critics complained about &quot;Wagnerism&quot; and the subordination of the voice to the noise of the orchestra. There was consternation that the heroine was an amoral seductress rather than a woman of virtue; Galli-Marié&#x27;s interpretation of the role was described by one critic as &quot;the very incarnation of vice&quot;. Others compared the work unfavourably with the traditional Opéra-Comique repertoire of Auber and Boieldieu. Léon Escudier in &quot;L&#x27;Art Musical&quot; called &quot;Carmen&quot;″s music &quot;dull and obscure... the ear grows weary of waiting for the cadence that never comes.&quot; It seemed that Bizet had generally failed to fulfill expectations, both of those who (given Halévy&#x27;s and Meilhac&#x27;s past associations) had expected something in the Offenbach mould, and of critics such as Adolphe Jullien who had anticipated a Wagnerian music drama. Among the few supportive critics was the poet Théodore de Banville; writing in &quot;Le National&quot;, he applauded Bizet for presenting a drama with real men and women instead of the usual Opéra-Comique &quot;puppets&quot;.

In its initial run at the Opéra-Comique, &quot;Carmen&quot; provoked little public enthusiasm; it shared the theatre for a while with Verdi&#x27;s much more popular &quot;Requiem&quot;. &quot;Carmen&quot; was often performed to half-empty houses, even when the management gave away large numbers of tickets. Early on 3 June, the day after the opera&#x27;s 33rd performance, Bizet died suddenly of heart disease, at the age of 36. It was his wedding anniversary. That night&#x27;s performance was cancelled; the tragic circumstances brought a temporary increase in public interest during the brief period before the season ended. Du Locle brought &quot;Carmen&quot; back in November 1875, with the original cast, and it ran for a further 12 performances until 15 February 1876 to give a year&#x27;s total for the original production of 48. Among those who attended one of these later performances was Tchaikovsky, who wrote to his benefactor, Nadezhda von Meck: &quot;&quot;Carmen&quot; is a masterpiece in every sense of the word... one of those rare creations which expresses the efforts of a whole musical epoch.&quot; After the final performance, &quot;Carmen&quot; was not seen in Paris again until 1883.

===Early revivals===
Shortly before his death Bizet signed a contract for a production of &quot;Carmen&quot; by the Vienna Court Opera. For this version, first staged on 23 October 1875, Bizet&#x27;s friend Ernest Guiraud replaced the original dialogue with recitatives, to create a &quot;grand opera&quot; format. Guiraud also reorchestrated music from Bizet&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Arlésienne suite&quot; to provide a spectacular ballet for &quot;Carmen&quot;″s second act. Shortly before the initial Vienna performance, the Court Opera&#x27;s director Franz von Jauner decided to use parts of the original dialogue along with some of Guiraud&#x27;s recitatives; this hybrid and the full recitative version became the norms for productions of the opera outside France for most of the next century.
Despite its deviations from Bizet&#x27;s original format, and some critical reservations, the 1875 Vienna production was a great success with the city&#x27;s public. It also won praise from both Wagner and Brahms. The latter reportedly saw the opera twenty times, and said he would have &quot;gone to the ends of the earth to embrace Bizet&quot;. The Viennese triumph began the opera&#x27;s rapid ascent towards worldwide fame. In February 1876 it began a run in Brussels at La Monnaie; it returned there the following year, with Galli-Marié in the title role, and thereafter became a permanent fixture in the Brussels repertory. On 17 June 1878 &quot;Carmen&quot; was produced in London, at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, where Minnie Hauk began her long association with the part of Carmen. A parallel London production at Covent Garden, with Adelina Patti, was cancelled when Patti withdrew. The successful Her Majesty&#x27;s production, sung in Italian, had an equally enthusiastic reception in Dublin. On 23 October 1878 the opera received its American premiere, at the New York Academy of Music, and in the same year was introduced to Saint Petersburg.

In the following five years performances were given in numerous American and European cities. The opera found particular favour in Germany, where the Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, apparently saw it on 27 different occasions and where Friedrich Nietzsche opined that he &quot;became a better man when Bizet speaks to me&quot;. &quot;Carmen&quot; was also acclaimed in numerous French provincial cities including Marseille, Lyon and, in 1881, Dieppe, where Galli-Marié returned to the role. In August 1881 the singer wrote to Bizet&#x27;s widow to report that &quot;Carmen&quot;″s Spanish premiere, in Barcelona, had been &quot;another great success&quot;. But Carvalho, who had assumed the management of the Opéra-Comique, thought the work immoral and refused to reinstate it. Meilhac and Hálevy were more prepared to countenance a revival, provided that Galli-Marié had no part in it; they blamed her interpretation for the relative failure of the opening run.

In April 1883 Carvalho finally revived &quot;Carmen&quot; at the Opéra-Comique, with Adèle Isaac featuring in an under-rehearsed production that removed some of the controversial aspects of the original. Carvalho was roundly condemned by the critics for offering a travesty of what had come to be regarded as a masterpiece of French opera; nevertheless, this version was acclaimed by the public and played to full houses. In October Carvalho yielded to pressure and revised the production; he brought back Galli-Marié, and restored the score and libretto to their 1875 forms.

===Worldwide success===

On 9 January 1884, &quot;Carmen&quot; was given its first New York Metropolitan Opera performance, to a mixed critical reception. &quot;The New York Times&quot; welcomed Bizet&#x27;s &quot;pretty and effective work&quot;, but compared Zelia Trebelli&#x27;s interpretation of the title role unfavourably with that of Minnie Hauk. Thereafter &quot;Carmen&quot; was quickly incorporated into the Met&#x27;s regular repertory. In February 1906 Enrico Caruso sang José at the Met for the first time; he continued to perform in this role until 1919, two years before his death. On 17 April 1906, on tour with the Met, he sang the role at the Grand Opera House in San Francisco. Afterwards he sat up until 3 am reading the reviews in the early editions of the following day&#x27;s papers. Two hours later he was awakened by the first violent shocks of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, after which he and his fellow performers made a hurried escape from the Palace Hotel.

The popularity of &quot;Carmen&quot; continued through succeeding generations of American opera-goers; by the beginning of 2011 the Met alone had performed it almost a thousand times. It enjoyed similar success in other American cities and in all parts of the world, in many different languages. Carmen&#x27;s habanera from act 1, and the toreador&#x27;s song &quot;Votre toast&quot; from act 2, are among the most popular and best-known of all operatic arias, the latter &quot;a splendid piece of swagger&quot; according to Newman, &quot;against which the voices and the eyebrows of purists have long been raised in vain&quot;. Most of the productions outside France followed the example created in Vienna and incorporated lavish ballet interludes and other spectacles, a practice which Mahler abandoned in Vienna when he revived the work there in 1900. In 1919, Bizet&#x27;s aged contemporary Camille Saint-Saëns was still complaining about the &quot;strange idea&quot; of adding a ballet, which he considered &quot;a hideous blemish in that masterpiece&quot;, and he wondered why Bizet&#x27;s wife had permitted it.

At the Opéra-Comique, after its 1883 revival, &quot;Carmen&quot; was always presented in the dialogue version with minimal musical embellishments. By 1888, the year of the 50th anniversary of Bizet&#x27;s birth, the opera had been performed there 330 times; by 1938, his centenary year, the total of performances at the theatre had reached 2,271. However, outside France the practice of using recitatives remained the norm for many years; the Carl Rosa Opera Company&#x27;s 1947 London production, and Walter Felsenstein&#x27;s 1949 staging at the Berlin Komische Oper, are among the first known instances in which the dialogue version was used other than in France. Neither of these innovations led to much change in practice; a similar experiment was tried at Covent Garden in 1953 but hurriedly withdrawn, and the first American production with spoken dialogue, in Colorado in 1953, met with a similar fate.

Dean has commented on the dramatic distortions that arise from the suppression of the dialogue; the effect, he says, is that the action moves forward &quot;in a series of jerks, rather instead of by smooth transition&quot;, and that most of the minor characters are substantially diminished. Only late in the 20th century did dialogue versions become common in opera houses outside France, but there is still no universally recognised full score. Fritz Oeser&#x27;s 1964 edition is an attempt to fill this gap, but in Dean&#x27;s view is unsatisfactory. Oeser reintroduces material removed by Bizet during the first rehearsals, and ignores many of the late changes and improvements that the composer made immediately before the first performance; he thus, according to Susan McClary, &quot;inadvertently preserves as definitive an early draft of the opera&quot;. In the early 21st century new editions were prepared by Robert Didion and Richard Langham-Smith, published by Schott and Peters respectively. Each departs significantly from Bizet&#x27;s vocal score of March 1875, published during his lifetime after he had personally corrected the proofs; Dean believes this vocal score should be the basis of any standard edition. Lesley Wright, a contemporary Bizet scholar, remarks that, unlike his compatriots Rameau and Debussy, Bizet has not been accorded a critical edition of his principal works; should this transpire, she says, &quot;we might expect yet another scholar to attempt to refine the details of this vibrant score which has so fascinated the public and performers for more than a century.&quot; Meanwhile, &quot;Carmen&quot;″s popularity endures; according to Macdonald: &quot;The memorability of Bizet&#x27;s tunes will keep the music of Carmen alive in perpetuity,&quot; and its status as a popular classic is unchallenged by any other French opera.

==Music==
Hervé Lacombe, in his survey of 19th-century French opera, contends that &quot;Carmen&quot; is one of the few works from that large repertory to have stood the test of time. While he places the opera firmly within the long &quot;opéra comique&quot; tradition, Macdonald considers that it transcends the genre and that its immortality is assured by &quot;the combination in abundance of striking melody, deft harmony and perfectly judged orchestration&quot;. Dean sees Bizet&#x27;s principal achievement in the demonstration of the main actions of the opera in the music, rather than in the dialogue, writing that &quot;Few artists have expressed so vividly the torments inflicted by sexual passions and jealousy.&quot; Dean places Bizet&#x27;s realism in a different category from the &quot;verismo&quot; of Puccini and others; he likens the composer to Mozart and Verdi in his ability to engage his audiences with the emotions and sufferings of his characters.
Bizet, who had never visited Spain, sought out appropriate ethnic material to provide an authentic Spanish flavour to his music. Carmen&#x27;s habanera is based on an idiomatic song, &quot;El arreglito&quot;, by the Spanish composer Sebastián Yradier (1809–65). Bizet had taken this to be a genuine folk melody; when he learned its recent origin he added a note to the vocal score, crediting Yradier. He used a genuine folksong as the source of Carmen&#x27;s defiant &quot;Coupe-moi, brûle-moi&quot; while other parts of the score, notably the &quot;Seguidilla&quot;, utilise the rhythms and instrumentation associated with flamenco music. However, Dean insists that &quot;[t]his is a French, not a Spanish opera&quot;; the &quot;foreign bodies&quot;, while they undoubtedly contribute to the unique atmosphere of the opera, form only a small ingredient of the complete music.
The prelude to act 1 combines three recurrent themes: the entry of the bullfighters from act 4, the refrain from the Toreador Song from act 2, and the motif that, in two slightly differing forms, represents both Carmen herself and the fate she personifies. This motif, played on clarinet, bassoon, cornet and cellos over tremolo strings, concludes the prelude with an abrupt crescendo. When the curtain rises a light and sunny atmosphere is soon established, and pervades the opening scenes. The mock solemnities of the changing of the guard, and the flirtatious exchanges between the townsfolk and the factory girls, precede a mood change when a brief phrase from the fate motif announces Carmen&#x27;s entrance. After her provocative habanera, with its persistent insidious rhythm and changes of key, the fate motif sounds in full when Carmen throws her flower to José before departing. This action elicits from José a passionate A major solo which Dean suggests is the turning-point in his musical characterisation. The softer vein returns briefly, as Micaëla reappears and joins with José in a duet to a warm clarinet and strings accompaniment. The tranquillity is shattered by the women&#x27;s noisy quarrel, Carmen&#x27;s dramatic re-entry and her defiant interaction with Zuniga. After her beguiling &quot;Seguidilla&quot; provokes José to an exasperated high A sharp shout, Carmen&#x27;s escape is preceded by the brief but disconcerting reprise of a fragment from the habanera. Bizet revised this finale several times to increase its dramatic effect.

Act 2 begins with a short prelude, based on a melody that José will sing offstage before his next entry. A festive scene in the inn precedes Escamillo&#x27;s tumultuous entrance, in which brass and percussion provide prominent backing while the crowd sings along. The quintet that follows is described by Newman as &quot;of incomparable verve and musical wit&quot;. José&#x27;s appearance precipitates a long mutual wooing scene; Carmen sings, dances and plays the castanets; a distant cornet-call summoning José to duty is blended with Carmen&#x27;s melody so as to be barely discernible. A muted reference to the fate motif on an English horn leads to José&#x27;s &quot;Flower Song&quot;, a flowing continuous melody that ends &quot;pianissimo&quot; on a sustained high B-flat. José&#x27;s insistence that, despite Carmen&#x27;s blandishments, he must return to duty leads to a quarrel; the arrival of Zuniga, the consequent fight and José&#x27;s unavoidable ensnarement into the lawless life culminates musically in the triumphant hymn to freedom that closes the act.

The prelude to act 3 was originally intended for Bizet&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Arlésienne&quot; score. Newman describes it as &quot;an exquisite miniature, with much dialoguing and intertwining between the woodwind instruments&quot;. As the action unfolds, the tension between Carmen and José is evident in the music. In the card scene, the lively duet for Frasquita and Mercédès turns ominous when Carmen intervenes; the fate motif underlines her premonition of death. Micaëla&#x27;s aria, after her entry in search of José, is a conventional piece, though of deep feeling, preceded and concluded by horn calls. The middle part of the act is occupied by Escamillo and José, now acknowledged as rivals for Carmen&#x27;s favour. The music reflects their contrasting attitudes: Escamillo remains, says Newman, &quot;invincibly polite and ironic&quot;, while José is sullen and aggressive. When Micaëla pleads with José to go with her to his mother, the harshness of Carmen&#x27;s music reveals her most unsympathetic side. As José departs, vowing to return, the fate theme is heard briefly in the woodwind. The confident, off-stage sound of the departing Escamillo singing the toreador&#x27;s refrain provides a distinct contrast to José&#x27;s increasing desperation.

The final act is prefaced with a lively orchestral piece derived from Manuel García&#x27;s short operetta &quot;El criado fingido&quot;. After the opening crowd scene, the bullfighters&#x27; march is led by the children&#x27;s chorus; the crowd hails Escamillo before his short love scene with Carmen. The long finale, in which José makes his last pleas to Carmen and is decisively rejected, is punctuated at critical moments by enthusiastic off-stage shouts from the bullfighting arena. As José kills Carmen, the chorus sing the refrain of the Toreador Song off-stage; the fate motif, which has been suggestively present at various points during the act, is heard fortissimo, together with a brief reference to Carmen&#x27;s card scene music. Jose&#x27;s last words of love and despair are followed by a final long chord, on which the curtain falls without further musical or vocal comment.

==Recordings==
&quot;Carmen&quot; has been the subject of many recordings, beginning with early wax cylinder recordings of excerpts in the 1890s, a nearly complete performance in German from 1908 with Emmy Destinn in the title role, and a complete 1911 Opéra-Comique recording in French. Since then, many of the leading opera houses and artistes have recorded the work, in both studio and live performances. Over the years many versions have been commended and reissued. From the mid-1990s numerous video recordings have become available. These include David McVicar&#x27;s Glyndebourne production of 2002, and the Royal Opera productions of 2007 and 2010, each designed by Francesca Zambello.

==Adaptations==

In 1883, the Spanish violinist and composer Pablo de Sarasate wrote a &quot;Carmen Fantasy&quot; for violin, described as &quot;ingenious and technically difficult&quot;. Ferruccio Busoni&#x27;s 1920 piece, Piano Sonatina No. 6 (Fantasia da camera super Carmen), is based on themes from &quot;Carmen&quot;. The Russian pianist Vladimir Horowitz played his &quot;Variations on a Theme from &quot;Carmen&quot;&quot; (1926) throughout his career. In 1967, the Russian composer Rodion Shchedrin adapted parts of the &quot;Carmen&quot; music into a ballet, the &quot;Carmen Suite&quot;, written for his wife Maya Plisetskaya, then the Bolshoi Ballet&#x27;s principal ballerina.

In 1983 the stage director Peter Brook produced an adaptation of Bizet&#x27;s opera known as &quot;La Tragedie de Carmen&quot; in collaboration with the writer Jean-Claude Carrière and the composer Marius Constant. This 90-minute version focused on four main characters, eliminating choruses and the major arias were reworked for chamber orchestra. Brook first produced it in Paris, and it has since been performed in many cities.

The character &quot;Carmen&quot; has been a regular subject of film treatment since the earliest days of cinema. The films were made in various languages and interpreted by several cultures, and have been created by prominent directors including , Raoul Walsh (1915) with Theda Bara, Cecil B. DeMille (1915), and &quot;The Loves of Carmen&quot; (1948) with Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford, directed by Charles Vidor. Otto Preminger&#x27;s 1954 &quot;Carmen Jones&quot;, with an all-black cast, is based on the 1943 Oscar Hammerstein Broadway musical of the same name, an adaptation of the opera transposed to 1940s North Carolina extending to Chicago. &quot;The Wild, Wild Rose&quot; is a 1960 Hong Kong film which adapts the plot and main character to the setting of a Wanchai nightclub, including renditions of some of the most famous songs by Grace Chang. Other adaptions include Carlos Saura (1983) (who made a flamenco-based dance film with two levels of story telling), Peter Brook (1983) (filming his compressed &quot;La Tragédie de Carmen&quot;) and Jean-Luc Godard (1984). Francesco Rosi&#x27;s film of 1984, with Julia Migenes and Plácido Domingo, is generally faithful to the original story and to Bizet&#x27;s music. &quot;Carmen on Ice&quot; (1990), starring Katarina Witt, Brian Boitano and Brian Orser, was inspired by Witt&#x27;s gold medal-winning performance during the 1988 Winter Olympics. Robert Townsend&#x27;s 2001 film, &quot;&quot;, starring Beyoncé Knowles, is a more recent attempt to create an African-American version. &quot;Carmen&quot; was interpreted in modern ballet by the South African dancer and choreographer Dada Masilo in 2010.

The opera has been adapted at least twice in African films, as &quot;Karmen Geï&quot;, directed by Joseph Gaï Ramaka in 2001, and &quot;U-Carmen eKhayelitsha&quot;, directed by Mark Dornford-May in 2005, and achieving the Golden Bear award of the Berlinale that year.

<text> (; &quot;The Master-Singers of Nuremberg&quot;), WWV 96, is a music drama, or opera, in three acts, by Richard Wagner. It is the longest opera commonly performed, taking nearly four and a half hours, not counting two breaks between acts, and is traditionally not cut. With Hans von Bülow conducting, it was first performed on 21 June 1868 at the National Theater in Munich, today home of Bavarian State Opera.

The story is set in Nuremberg in the mid-16th century. At the time, Nuremberg was a free imperial city and one of the centers of the Renaissance in Northern Europe. The story revolves around the city&#x27;s guild of &quot;Meistersinger&quot; (Master Singers), an association of amateur poets and musicians who were primarily master craftsmen of various trades. The master singers had developed a craftsmanlike approach to music-making, with an intricate system of rules for composing and performing songs. The work draws much of its atmosphere from its depiction of the Nuremberg of the era and the traditions of the master-singer guild. One of the main characters, the cobbler-poet Hans Sachs, is based on a historical figure, Hans Sachs (1494–1576), the most famous of the master-singers.

&quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot; occupies a unique place in Wagner&#x27;s oeuvre. It is the only comedy among his mature operas (he had come to reject his early &quot;Das Liebesverbot&quot;) and is also unusual among his works in being set in a historically well-defined time and place rather than in a mythical or legendary setting. It is the only mature Wagner opera based on an entirely original story, and in which no supernatural or magical powers or events feature. It incorporates many of the operatic conventions that Wagner had railed against in his essays on the theory of opera: rhymed verse, arias, choruses, a quintet, and even a ballet.

The autograph manuscript of the opera is preserved in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum.

==Composition history==
Wagner&#x27;s autobiography (&quot;My Life&quot;) described the genesis of . Taking the waters at Marienbad in 1845 he began reading Georg Gottfried Gervinus&#x27; &quot;Geschichte der deutschen Dichtung&quot; (History of German Poetry). This work included chapters on master song and on Hans Sachs.
I had formed a particularly vivid picture of Hans Sachs and the mastersingers of Nuremberg. I was especially intrigued by the institution of the Marker and his function in rating master-songs ... I conceived during a walk a comic scene in which the popular artisan-poet, by hammering upon his cobbler&#x27;s last, gives the Marker, who is obliged by circumstances to sing in his presence, his come-uppance for previous pedantic misdeeds during official singing contests, by inflicting upon him a lesson of his own.

Gervinus&#x27; book also mentions a poem by the real-life Hans Sachs on the subject of Protestant reformer Martin Luther, called &quot;Die Wittenbergisch Nachtigall&quot; (The Wittenberg Nightingale). The opening lines for this poem, addressing the Reformation, were later used by Wagner in Act III Scene 5 when the crowd acclaims Sachs: &quot;&quot; (Awake, the dawn is drawing near; I hear, singing in the green grove, a blissful nightingale)

In addition to this, Wagner added a scene drawn from his own life, in which a case of mistaken identity led to a near-riot: this was to be the basis for the finale of Act II.
Out of this situation evolved an uproar, which through the shouting and clamour and an inexplicable growth in the number of participants in the struggle soon assumed a truly demoniacal character. It looked to me as if the whole town would break out into a riot...Then suddenly I heard a heavy thump, and as if by magic the whole crowd dispersed in every direction...One of the regular patrons had felled one of the noisiest rioters ... And it was the effect of this which had scattered everybody so suddenly.

This first draft of the story was dated &quot;Marienbad 16 July 1845&quot;. Wagner later said, in &quot;Eine Mitteilung an meine Freunde&quot; (1851) (A Communication to my Friends) that was to be a comic opera to follow a tragic opera, i.e. &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;. Just as the Athenians had followed a tragedy with a comic satyr play, so Wagner would follow with : the link being that both operas included song-contests.

===Influence of Schopenhauer===
In 1854, Wagner first read Schopenhauer, and was struck by the philosopher&#x27;s theories on aesthetics. In this philosophy, art is a means for escaping from the sufferings of the world, and music is the highest of the arts since it is the only one not involved in representation of the world (i.e. it is abstract). It is for this reason that music can communicate emotion without the need for words. In his earlier essay &quot;Oper und Drama&quot; (Opera and Drama) (1850–1) Wagner had derided staples of operatic construction: arias, choruses, duets, trios, recitatives, etc. As a result of reading Schopenhauer&#x27;s ideas about the role of music, Wagner re-evaluated his prescription for opera, and included many of these elements in .

Although is a comedy, it also elucidates Wagner&#x27;s ideas on the place of music in society, on renunciation of &quot;Wille&quot; (Will), and on the solace that music can bring in a world full of (delusion, folly, self-deception). It is which causes the riot in Act II – a sequence of events arising from a case of mistaken identity, which can be seen as a form of self-delusion. Commentators have observed that in his famous Act III monologue (Madness! Madness!, Everywhere madness!), Sachs paraphrases Schopenhauer&#x27;s description of the way that drives a person to behave in ways that are self-destructive:
&lt;poem lang=&quot;de&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;in Flucht geschlagen, wähnt er zu jagen; hört nicht sein eigen Schmerzgekreisch,
wenn er sich wühlt ins eig&#x27;ne Fleisch, wähnt Lust sich zu erzeigen!&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;driven into flight he believes he is hunting, and does not hear his own cry of pain:
when he tears into his own flesh, he imagines he is giving himself pleasure!&lt;/poem&gt;

Following the completion of &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, Wagner resumed work on in 1861 with a quite different philosophical outlook from that which he held when he developed his first draft. The character of Hans Sachs became one of the most Schopenhauerian of Wagner&#x27;s creations. Wagner scholar Lucy Beckett has noted the remarkable similarity between Wagner&#x27;s Sachs and Schopenhauer&#x27;s description of the noble man:

We always picture a very noble character to ourselves as having a certain trace of silent sadness... It is a consciousness that has resulted from knowledge of the vanity of all achievements and of the suffering of all life, not merely of one&#x27;s own. (Schopenhauer: &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot;)

The other distinctive manifestation of Sachs&#x27;s character – his calm renunciation of the prospect of becoming a suitor for Eva&#x27;s love – is also deeply Schopenhauerian. Sachs here denies the Will in its supposedly most insistent form, that of sexual love. Wagner marks this moment with a direct musical and textual reference to &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;: (&quot;My child, I know a sad tale of Tristan and Isolde. Hans Sachs was clever and did not want anything of King Marke&#x27;s lot.&quot;)

===Completion and premiere===
Having completed the scenario, Wagner began writing the libretto while living in Paris in 1862, and followed this by composing the overture. The overture was publicly performed in Leipzig on 2 November 1862, conducted by the composer. Composition of Act I was begun in spring of 1863 in the Viennese suburb of Penzing, but the opera in its entirety was not finished until October 1867, when Wagner was living at Tribschen near Lucerne. These years were some of Wagner&#x27;s most difficult: the 1861 Paris production of &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; was a fiasco, Wagner gave up hope of completing &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;, the 1864 Vienna production of &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; was abandoned after 77 rehearsals, and finally in 1866 Wagner&#x27;s first wife, Minna, died. Cosima Wagner was later to write: &quot;When future generations seek refreshment in this unique work, may they spare a thought for the tears from which the smiles arose.&quot;

The premiere was given at the Königliches Hof- und National-Theater, Munich, on 21 June 1868. The production was sponsored by Ludwig II of Bavaria and the conductor was Hans von Bülow. Franz Strauss, the father of the composer Richard Strauss, played the French horn at the premiere, despite his often-expressed dislike of Wagner, who was present at many of the rehearsals. Wagner&#x27;s frequent interruptions and digressions made rehearsals a very long-winded affair. After one 5 hour rehearsal, Franz Strauss led a strike by the orchestra, saying that he could not play any more. Despite these problems, the premiere was a triumph, and the opera was hailed as one of Wagner&#x27;s most successful works. At the end of the first performance, the audience called for Wagner, who appeared at the front of the Royal box, which he had been sharing with King Ludwig. Wagner bowed to the crowd, breaking court protocol, which dictated that only the monarch could address an audience from the box.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Nuremberg, towards the middle of the sixteenth century.&quot;

===Act 1===
Prelude

&quot;Scene 1: Interior of Katharinenkirche (St. Catherine&#x27;s Church) in Nuremberg, Saint John&#x27;s Eve or Midsummer&#x27;s Eve, June 23&quot;

After the prelude, a church service is just ending with a singing of &quot;Da zu dir der Heiland kam&quot; (When the Saviour came to thee), an impressive pastiche of a Lutheran chorale, as Walther von Stolzing, a young knight from Franconia, addresses Eva Pogner, whom he had met earlier, and asks her if she is engaged to anyone. Eva and Walther have fallen in love at first sight, but she informs him that her father, the goldsmith and mastersinger Veit Pogner, has arranged to give her hand in marriage to the winner of the guild&#x27;s song contest on Saint John&#x27;s Day (Midsummer&#x27;s Day), tomorrow. Eva&#x27;s maid, Magdalena, gets David, Hans Sachs&#x27;s apprentice, to tell Walther about the mastersingers&#x27; art. The hope is for Walther to qualify as a mastersinger during the guild meeting, traditionally held in the church after Mass, and thus earn a place in the song contest despite his utter ignorance of the master-guild&#x27;s rules and conventions.

&quot;Scene 2&quot;

As the other apprentices set up the church for the meeting, David warns Walther that it is not easy to become a mastersinger; it takes many years of learning and practice. David gives a confusing lecture on the mastersingers&#x27; rules for composing and singing. (Many of the tunes he describes were real master-tunes from the period.) Walther is confused by the complicated rules, but is determined to try for a place in the guild anyway.

&quot;Scene 3&quot;

The first mastersingers file into the church, including Eva&#x27;s wealthy father Veit Pogner and the town clerk Beckmesser. Beckmesser, a clever technical singer who was expecting to win the contest without opposition, is distressed to see that Walther is Pogner&#x27;s guest and intends to enter the contest. Meanwhile, Pogner introduces Walther to the other mastersingers as they arrive. Fritz Kothner the baker, serving as chairman of this meeting, calls the roll. Pogner, addressing the assembly, announces his offer of his daughter&#x27;s hand for the winner of the song contest. When Hans Sachs argues that Eva ought to have a say in the matter, Pogner agrees that Eva may refuse the winner of the contest, but she must still marry a mastersinger. Another suggestion by Sachs, that the townspeople, rather than the masters, should be called upon to judge the winner of the contest, is rejected by the other masters. Pogner formally introduces Walther as a candidate for admission into the master guild. Questioned by Kothner about his background, Walther states that his teacher in poetry was Walther von der Vogelweide whose works he studied in his own private library in Franconia, and his teachers in music were the birds and nature itself. Reluctantly the masters agree to admit him, provided he can perform a master-song of his own composition. Walther chooses love as the topic for his song and therefore is to be judged by Beckmesser alone, the &quot;Marker&quot; of the guild for worldly matters. At the signal to begin (&quot;Fanget an!&quot;), Walther launches into a novel free-form tune (&quot;So rief der Lenz in den Wald&quot;), breaking all the mastersingers&#x27; rules, and his song is constantly interrupted by the scratch of Beckmesser&#x27;s chalk on his chalkboard, maliciously noting one violation after another. When Beckmesser has completely covered the slate with symbols of Walther&#x27;s errors, he interrupts the song and argues that there is no point in finishing it. Sachs tries to convince the masters to let Walther continue, but Beckmesser sarcastically tells Sachs to stop trying to set policy and instead, to finish making his (Beckmesser&#x27;s) new shoes, which are overdue. Raising his voice over the masters&#x27; argument, Walther finishes his song, but the masters reject him and he rushes out of the church.

===Act 2===
&quot;Evening. On the street corner by Pogner&#x27;s and Sachs&#x27;s houses. A linden tree (tilia or lime-tree or basswood) stands outside Pogner&#x27;s house, a &quot;Flieder&quot;-tree (syringa or lilac-tree) before Sachs&#x27;s. Apprentices are closing the shutters.&quot;

&quot;Scene 1&quot;

The apprentices sing joyfully about St. John&#x27;s Day, also called Midsummer Day, and its accompanying garlands of flowers and ribbons (&quot;Johannistag! Johannistag!&quot;). David informs Magdalena of Walther&#x27;s failure. In her disappointment, Magdalena leaves without giving David the food she had brought for him. This arouses the derision of the other apprentices, and David is about to turn on them when Sachs arrives and hustles his apprentice into the workshop.

&quot;Scene 2&quot;

Pogner arrives with Eva, engaging in a roundabout conversation: Eva is hesitant to ask about the outcome of Walther&#x27;s application, and Pogner has private doubts about whether it was wise to offer his daughter&#x27;s hand in marriage for the song contest. As they enter their house, Magdalena appears and tells Eva about the rumours of Walther&#x27;s failure. Eva decides to ask Sachs about the matter.

&quot;Scene 3&quot;

As twilight falls, Hans Sachs takes a seat in front of his house to work on new shoes for Beckmesser. He muses about Walther&#x27;s song, which has made a deep impression on him (&quot;Was duftet doch der Flieder&quot;, known as the Flieder Monologue).

&quot;Scene 4&quot;

Eva approaches Sachs, and they discuss tomorrow&#x27;s song contest. Eva is unenthusiastic about Beckmesser, who appears to be the only eligible contestant. She hints that she would not mind if Sachs, a widower, were to win the contest. Though touched, Sachs protests that he would be too old a husband for her. Upon further prompting, Sachs describes Walther&#x27;s failure at the guild meeting. This causes Eva to storm off angrily, confirming Sachs&#x27;s suspicion that she has fallen in love with Walther. Eva is intercepted by Magdalena, who informs her that Beckmesser is coming to serenade her. Eva, determined to search for Walther, tells Magdalena to pose as her (Eva) at the bedroom window.

&quot;Scene 5&quot;

Just as Eva is about to leave, Walther appears. He tells her that he has been rejected by the mastersingers, and the two prepare to elope. However, Sachs has overheard their plans. As they are passing by, he illuminates the street with his lantern, forcing them to hide in the shadow of Pogner&#x27;s house. Walther makes up his mind to confront Sachs, but is interrupted by the arrival of Beckmesser.

&quot;Scene 6&quot;

As Eva and Walther retreat further into the shadows, Beckmesser begins his serenade. Sachs interrupts him by launching into a full-bellied cobbling song, and hammering the soles of the half-made shoes. Annoyed, Beckmesser tells Sachs to stop, but the cobbler replies that he has to finish tempering the soles of the shoes, whose lateness Beckmesser had publicly complained about (in Act I). Sachs offers a compromise: he will be quiet and let Beckmesser sing, but he (Sachs) will be Beckmesser&#x27;s &quot;marker&quot;, and mark each of Beckmesser&#x27;s musical/poetical errors by striking one of the soles with his hammer. Beckmesser, who has spotted someone at Eva&#x27;s window (Magdalena in disguise), has no time to argue. He tries to sing his serenade, but he makes so many mistakes (his tune repeatedly places accents on the wrong syllables of the words) that from the repeated knocks Sachs finishes the shoes. David wakes up and sees Beckmesser apparently serenading Magdalena. He attacks Beckmesser in a fit of jealous rage. The entire neighborhood is awakened by the noise. The other apprentices rush into the fray, and the situation degenerates into a full-blown riot. In the confusion, Walther tries to escape with Eva, but Sachs pushes Eva into her home and drags Walther into his own workshop. Quiet is restored as abruptly as it was broken. A lone figure walks through the street – the nightwatchman, calling out the hour.

===Act 3===
Prelude, a meditative orchestral introduction using music from two key episodes to be heard in act 3: Sachs&#x27;s scene 1 monologue &quot;Wahn! Wahn!&quot; and the &quot;Wittenberg Nightingale&quot; quasi-chorale sung by the townspeople to greet Sachs in scene 5.
&quot;Scene 1: Sachs&#x27;s workshop&quot;

As morning dawns, Sachs is reading a large book. Lost in thought, he does not respond as David returns from delivering Beckmesser&#x27;s shoes. David finally manages to attract his master&#x27;s attention, and they discuss the upcoming festivities – it is Saint John&#x27;s day, Hans Sachs&#x27;s name day. David recites his verses for Sachs, and leaves to prepare for the festival. Alone, Sachs ponders last night&#x27;s riot. &quot;Madness! Madness! Everywhere madness!&quot; (&quot;Wahn! Wahn! Überall Wahn!&quot;) His attempt to prevent an elopement had ended in shocking violence. Nevertheless, he is resolved to make madness work for him today.

&quot;Scene 2&quot;

Sachs gives Walther an interactive lesson on the history and philosophy of music and mastersinging, and teaches him to moderate his singing according to the spirit (if not the strict letter) of the masters&#x27; rules. Walther demonstrates his understanding by composing two sections of a new Prize Song in a more acceptable style than his previous effort from Act I. Sachs writes down the new verses as Walther sings them. A final section remains to be composed, but Walther postpones the task. The two men leave the room to dress for the festival.

&quot;Scene 3&quot;

Beckmesser, still sore from his drubbing the night before, enters the workshop. He spots the verses of the Prize Song, written in Sachs&#x27;s handwriting, and infers (erroneously) that Sachs is secretly planning to enter the contest for Eva&#x27;s hand. The cobbler re-enters the room and Beckmesser confronts him with the verses and asks if he wrote them. Sachs confirms that the handwriting is his, but does not clarify that he was not the author but merely served as scribe. However, he goes on to say that he has no intention of wooing Eva or entering the contest, and he presents the manuscript to Beckmesser as a gift. He promises never to claim the song for his own, and warns Beckmesser that it is a very difficult song to interpret and sing. Beckmesser, his confidence restored by the prospect of using verses written by the famous Hans Sachs, ignores the warning and rushes off to prepare for the song contest. Sachs smiles at Beckmesser&#x27;s foolishness but expresses hope that Beckmesser will learn to be better in the future.

&quot;Scene 4&quot;

Eva arrives at the workshop. She is looking for Walther, but pretends to have complaints about a shoe that Sachs made for her. Sachs realizes that the shoe is a perfect fit, but pretends to set about altering the stitching. As he works, he tells Eva that he has just heard a beautiful song, lacking only an ending. Eva cries out as Walther enters the room, splendidly attired for the festival, and sings the third and final section of the Prize Song. The couple are overwhelmed with gratitude for Sachs, and Eva asks Sachs to forgive her for having manipulated his feelings. The cobbler brushes them off with bantering complaints about his lot as a shoemaker, poet, and widower. At last, however, he admits to Eva that, despite his feelings for her, he is resolved to avoid the fate of King Marke (a reference to the subject of another Wagner opera, &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, in which an old man tries to marry a much younger woman), thus conferring his blessing upon the lovers. David and Magdalena appear. Sachs announces to the group that a new master-song has been born, which, following the rules of the mastersingers, is to be baptized. As an apprentice cannot serve as a witness for the baptism, he promotes David to the rank of journeyman with the traditional cuff on the ear (and by this also &quot;promoting&quot; him as a groom and Magdalena as a bride). He then christens the Prize Song the &quot;Morning Dream Song&quot; (&quot;Selige Morgentraumdeut-Weise&quot;). After celebrating their good fortune with an extended quintet &quot;(Selig, wie die Sonne meines Glückes lacht)&quot; – musically capping the first four scenes of act 3 – the group departs for the festival.

&quot;Scene 5&quot;

Almost an act in itself, this scene occupies about 45 minutes of the two hours of act 3 and is separated from the preceding four scenes by &quot;Verwandlungsmusik&quot;, a transforming interlude. Meadow by the Pegnitz River. It is the Feast of St. John.

Various guilds enter boasting of their contributions to Nürnberg&#x27;s success; Wagner depicts three of them: the Cobblers, whose chorus &quot;Sankt Krispin, lobet ihn!&quot; uses the signature cry &quot;streck! streck! streck!&quot;; the Tailors, who sing the chorus &quot;Als Nürnberg belagert war&quot; with the goat cry &quot;meck! meck! meck!&quot;; and the Bakers, who cut the tailors off with &quot;Hungersnot! Hungersnot!&quot;, or &quot;Famine, famine!&quot;, and its &quot;beck! beck! beck!&quot;, or &quot;bake, bake, bake!&quot;

This leads into the &quot;Tanz der Lehrbuben&quot; (Dance of the Apprentices). The mastersingers themselves then grandly arrive: the Procession of the Masters. The crowd sings the praises of Hans Sachs, the most beloved and famous of the mastersingers; here Wagner provides a rousing chorus, &quot;Wach&#x27; auf, es nahet gen den Tag&quot;, using words written by the historical Sachs himself, in a chorale-like four-part setting, relating it to the chorales of the &quot;Wittenberg Nightingale&quot; (a metaphor for Martin Luther).
The prize contest begins. Beckmesser attempts to sing the verses that he had obtained from Sachs. However, he garbles the words &quot;(Morgen ich leuchte)&quot; and fails to fit them to an appropriate melody, and ends up singing so clumsily that the crowd laughs him off. Before storming off in anger, he yells that the song was not even his: Hans Sachs tricked him into singing it. The crowd is confused. How could the great Hans Sachs have written such a bad song? Sachs tells them that the song is not his own, and also that it is in fact a beautiful song which the masters will love when they hear it sung correctly. To prove this, he calls a witness: Walther. The people are so curious about the song (correctly worded as &quot;Morgenlich leuchtend im rosigen Schein&quot;) that they allow Walther to sing it, and everyone is won over in spite of its novelty.

They declare Walther the winner, and the mastersingers want to make him a member of their guild on the spot. At first Walther is tempted to reject their offer, but Sachs intervenes once more and explains that art, even ground-breaking, contrary art like Walther&#x27;s, can only exist within a cultural tradition, which tradition the art sustains and improves. Walther is convinced; he agrees to join. Pogner places the symbolic master-hood medal around his neck, Eva takes his hand, and the people sing once more the praises of Hans Sachs, the beloved mastersinger of Nuremberg.

==Reception==
 was enthusiastically received at its premiere in 1868, and was judged to be Wagner&#x27;s most immediately appealing work. Eduard Hanslick wrote in after the premiere: &quot;Dazzling scenes of colour and splendour, ensembles full of life and character unfold before the spectator&#x27;s eyes, hardly allowing him the leisure to weigh how much and how little of these effects is of musical origin.&quot;

Within a year of the premiere the opera was performed across Germany at Dresden, Dessau, Karlsruhe, Mannheim, Weimar, Hanover, and in Vienna, with Berlin following in 1870. It was one of the most popular and prominent German operas during the Unification of Germany in 1871, and in spite of the opera&#x27;s overall warning against cultural self-centeredness, became a potent symbol of patriotic German art. Hans Sachs&#x27;s final warning at the end of Act III on the need to preserve German art from foreign threats was a rallying point for German nationalism, particularly during the Franco-Prussian War.

&quot;Die Meistersinger&quot; was soon performed outside Germany as well, spreading throughout Europe and around the world:

At the reopening of the Bayreuth Festival in 1924 following its closure during World War I was performed. The audience rose to its feet during Hans Sachs&#x27;s final oration, and sang &quot;Deutschland über Alles&quot; after the opera had finished.

 was frequently used as part of Nazi propaganda. On 21 March 1933, the founding of the Third Reich was celebrated with a performance of the opera in the presence of Adolf Hitler. The prelude to Act III is played over shots of old Nuremberg at the beginning of &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;, the 1935 film by Leni Riefenstahl depicting the Nazi party congress of 1934. During World War II, was the only opera presented at the Bayreuth festivals of 1943–1944.

The association of with Nazism led to one of the most controversial stage productions of the work. The first Bayreuth production of following World War II occurred in 1956, when Wieland Wagner, the composer&#x27;s grandson, attempted to distance the work from German nationalism by presenting it in almost abstract terms, by removing any reference to Nuremberg from the scenery. The production was dubbed (The Mastersingers without Nuremberg).

==Criticisms of Beckmesser as a possible antisemitic trope ==
Beckmesser has been widely criticized as an antisemitic stereotype, ever since the idea was put forward by Theodor Adorno. Wagner scholar Barry Millington advanced the idea that Beckmesser represents a Jewish stereotype, whose humiliation by the Aryan Walther is an onstage representation of Wagner&#x27;s antisemitism. Millington argued in his 1991 &quot;Nuremberg Trial: Is There Anti-Semitism in ?&quot; that common antisemitic stereotypes prevalent in 19th-century Germany were a part of the &quot;ideological fabric&quot; of and that Beckmesser embodied these unmistakable antisemitic characteristics. Millington&#x27;s article spurred significant debate among Wagner scholars including Charles Rosen, Hans Rudolph Vaget, Paul Lawrence Rose, and Karl A. Zaenker.

In a 2009 interview, Katharina Wagner, the composer&#x27;s great-granddaughter and co-director of the Bayreuth Festival, was asked whether she believed Wagner relied on Jewish stereotypes in his operas. Her response was, &quot;With Beckmesser he probably did.&quot; Nike Wagner, another of the composer&#x27;s great-granddaughters, contends that Beckmesser is principally the victim of sadism, &quot;which is inseparable from the syndrome that also produces violent fascism&quot;.

Scholars Dieter Borchmeyer, and Hermann Danuser support the thesis that with the character of Beckmesser, Wagner did not intend to allude to Jewish stereotypes, but rather to criticize (academic) pedantism in general. They point out similarities to the figure of Malvolio in Shakespeare&#x27;s comedy &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;.

Although the score calls for Beckmesser to rush off in a huff after his self-defeating attempt to sing Walther&#x27;s song, in some productions he remains and listens to Walther&#x27;s correct rendition of his song, and shakes hands with Sachs after the final monologue.

A related view holds that Beckmesser was designed to parody the renowned critic Eduard Hanslick, who valorized the music of Brahms and held Wagner&#x27;s music in low regard. We know that the original name of the Beckmesser character was &quot;Veit Hanslich,&quot; and we know that Wagner invited Hanslick to his initial reading of the libretto, though whether then the character still had the &quot;Hanslich&quot; name when Hanslick heard it is unclear. This second interpretation of Beckmesser may dovetail with the antisemitism interpretation above, as Wagner attacked Hanslick as &quot;of gracefully concealed Jewish origin&quot; in his revised edition of his essay Jewishness in Music.

<text>The Magic Flute (, ), K. 620, is an opera in two acts by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to a German libretto by Emanuel Schikaneder. The work is in the form of a &quot;Singspiel&quot;, a popular form during the time it was written that included both singing and spoken dialogue. The work premiered on 30 September 1791 at Schikaneder&#x27;s theatre, the Freihaus-Theater auf der Wieden in Vienna, just two months before the composer&#x27;s death. It was the last opera that Mozart composed. The opera was an outstanding success from its first performances, and remains a staple of the opera repertory to this day.

In the opera the Queen of the Night persuades Prince Tamino to rescue her daughter Pamina from captivity under the high priest Sarastro; instead, he learns the high ideals of Sarastro&#x27;s community and seeks to join it. Separately, then together, Tamino and Pamina undergo severe trials of initiation, which end in triumph, with the Queen and her cohorts vanquished. The earthy Papageno, who accompanies Tamino on his quest, fails the trials completely but is rewarded anyway with the hand of his ideal female companion Papagena. 

==Composition==
The opera was the culmination of a period of increasing involvement by Mozart with Schikaneder&#x27;s theatrical troupe, which since 1789 had been the resident company at the Theater auf der Wieden. Mozart was a close friend of one of the singer-composers of the troupe, tenor Benedikt Schack (the first Tamino), and had contributed to the compositions of the troupe, which were often collaboratively written. Mozart&#x27;s participation increased with his contributions to the 1790 collaborative opera &quot;Der Stein der Weisen&quot; (&quot;The Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;), including the duet (&quot;Nun liebes Weibchen&quot;, K. 625/592a) among other passages. Like &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, &quot;Der Stein der Weisen&quot; was a fairy-tale opera and can be considered a kind of precursor; it employed much the same cast in similar roles.

The libretto for &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, written by Schikaneder, is thought by scholars to be based on many sources. Some works of literature current in Vienna in Schikaneder&#x27;s day that may have served as sources include the medieval romance &quot;Yvain&quot; by Chrétien de Troyes, the novel &quot;Life of Sethos&quot; by Jean Terrasson, and the essay &quot;On the mysteries of the Egyptians&quot; by Ignaz von Born. The libretto is also a natural continuation of a series of fairy tale operas produced at the time by Schikaneder&#x27;s troupe, including an adaptation of Sophie Seyler&#x27;s Singspiel &quot;Oberon&quot; as well as &quot;Der Stein der Weisen&quot;. Especially for the role of Papageno, the libretto draws on the Hanswurst tradition of the Viennese popular theatre. Many scholars also acknowledge an influence of Freemasonry.

&quot;The Magic Flute&quot; appears to have two references to the music of Antonio Salieri. The first is that the Papageno–Papagena duet is similar to the Cucuzze cavatina in Salieri&#x27;s &quot;Prima la musica e poi le parole&quot;. Both are centred around musical-textual playfulness with humorous bird-like utterances of pseudo-Italian words. &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; also echoes Salieri&#x27;s music in that Papageno&#x27;s whistle is based on a motif borrowed from Salieri&#x27;s Concerto for Clavicembalo in B-flat major.

==Premiere and reception==
The opera was premiered in Vienna on 30 September 1791 at the suburban Freihaus-Theater auf der Wieden. Mozart conducted the orchestra and Schikaneder himself played Papageno, while the role of the Queen of the Night was sung by Mozart&#x27;s sister-in-law Josepha Hofer.

On the reception of the opera, Mozart scholar Maynard Solomon writes:
As Mozart&#x27;s letters show, he was very pleased to have achieved such a success. Solomon continues:
The opera celebrated its 100th performance in November 1792, though Mozart did not have the pleasure of witnessing this milestone, as he had died on 5 December 1791. The opera was first performed outside Vienna (21 September 1792) in Lemberg, then in Prague. It then made &quot;triumphal progress through Germany&#x27;s opera houses great and small&quot;, and with the early 19th century spread to essentially all the countries of Europe—and eventually, everywhere in the world—where opera is cultivated.

As Branscombe documents, the earlier performances were often of highly altered, sometimes even mutilated, versions of the opera (see &quot;Ludwig Wenzel Lachnith&quot;). Productions of the past century have tended to be more faithful to Mozart&#x27;s music, though faithful rendering of Mozart and Schikaneder&#x27;s original (quite explicit) stage directions and dramatic vision continues to be rare; with isolated exceptions, modern productions strongly reflect the creative preferences of the stage director.

&quot;The Magic Flute&quot; is among the most frequently performed of all operas.

==First publication==
On 28 December 1791, three and a half weeks after Mozart&#x27;s death, his widow Constanze offered to send a manuscript score of &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; to the electoral court in Bonn. Nikolaus Simrock published this text in the first full-score edition (Bonn, 1814), claiming that it was &quot;in accordance with Mozart&#x27;s own wishes&quot; (&quot;Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung&quot;, 13 September 1815).

==Themes==

&quot;The Magic Flute&quot; is noted for its prominent Masonic elements, although some scholars hold that the Masonic influence is exaggerated. Schikaneder and Mozart were Freemasons, as was Ignaz Alberti, engraver and printer of the first libretto. The opera is also influenced by Enlightenment philosophy and can be regarded as advocating enlightened absolutism. The Queen of the Night is seen by some to represent a dangerous form of obscurantism, by others to represent Roman Catholic Empress Maria Theresa, who banned Freemasonry from Austria. Still others see the Roman Catholic Church itself, which was and still is strongly anti-Masonic. Likewise, the literature repeatedly addresses the fact that the central theme of the work is not only &quot;love&quot;, but also becoming a better person by overcoming trials (similar to Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal&quot; later on).

==Roles==

The names of the performers at the premiere are taken from a preserved playbill for this performance (at right), which does not give full names; &quot;Hr.&quot; = Herr, Mr.; &quot;Mme.&quot; = Madame, Mrs.; &quot;Mlle.&quot; = Mademoiselle, Miss.

While the female roles in the opera are assigned to different voice types, the playbill for the premiere performance referred to all of the female singers as &quot;sopranos&quot;. The casting of the roles relies on the actual vocal range of the part.

== Instrumentation ==

The work is scored for two flutes (one doubling on piccolo), two oboes, two clarinets (doubling basset horns), two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, three trombones (alto, tenor, and bass), timpani and strings. It also requires a four-part chorus for several numbers (notably the finales of each act). Mozart also called for a &quot;&quot; (instrument of steel) to perform Papageno&#x27;s magic bells. This instrument has since been lost to history, though modern day scholars believe it to be a keyed glockenspiel, which is usually replaced with a celesta in modern-day performances.

Charles Rosen has remarked on the character of Mozart&#x27;s orchestration:

&quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; has the greatest variety of orchestral color that the eighteenth century was to know; the very lavishness, however, is paradoxically also an economy as each effect is a concentrated one, each one—Papageno&#x27;s whistle, the Queen of the Night&#x27;s coloratura, the bells, Sarastro&#x27;s trombones, even the farewell in scene 1 for clarinets and pizzicato strings—a single dramatic stroke.&quot;
==Synopsis==
===Overture===

The overture, composed after the other parts of the opera were complete, begins with a solemn three-chord sequence from the brass, associated with the Priests of the Temple of Wisdom. (The number three is highly significant in Freemasonry and recurs as the number of ladies, boys and temples.) It transitions in an adagio to a lively fugue in E-flat major. Halfway through, there is a false ending. After another three-chord brass sequence, the fugue resumes in E-flat minor, returning to E-flat major.

===Act 1===
====Scene 1: A rough, rocky landscape====

Tamino, a handsome prince lost in a distant land, is pursued by a serpent and asks the gods to save him (aria: &quot; / Help! Help!, segued into trio &quot; / Die, monster, by our might!). He faints, and three ladies, attendants of the Queen of the Night, appear and kill the serpent. They find the unconscious prince extremely attractive, and each of them tries to persuade the other two to leave her alone with him. After arguing, they reluctantly decide to leave together.
Tamino wakes up, and is surprised to find himself still alive and the serpent dead. Papageno enters dressed as a bird. He describes his life as a bird-catcher, complaining he has no wife or girlfriend (aria: &quot;&quot; / The birdcatcher am I indeed). Tamino introduces himself to Papageno, thinking Papageno killed the serpent. Papageno happily takes the credit – claiming he strangled it with his bare hands. The three ladies suddenly reappear and instead of giving Papageno wine, cake and figs, they give him water and a stone, and padlock his mouth closed as a warning not to lie. They give Tamino a portrait of the Queen of the Night&#x27;s daughter Pamina, with whom Tamino falls instantly in love (aria: / This portrait is enchantingly beautiful).

The ladies return and tell Tamino that Pamina has been captured by Sarastro, whom they describe as a powerful, evil demon. Tamino vows to rescue Pamina. The Queen of the Night appears and promises Tamino that Pamina will be his if he rescues her from Sarastro (Recitative: / Oh, tremble not, my dear son! – and aria: / You will go to free her). The Queen and the ladies leave and Papageno can only hum to bemoan the padlock on his mouth. (Quintet: &quot;Hm! Hm! Hm! Hm!&quot;). The ladies return and remove the padlock with a warning not to lie any more. They give Tamino a magic flute which has the power to change sorrow into joy, and Papageno magic bells for protection, telling him to go with Tamino. The ladies tell of three boys who will guide Tamino and Papageno to Sarastro&#x27;s temple. Together Tamino and Papageno set forth.

====Scene 2: A room in Sarastro&#x27;s palace====

Pamina is dragged in by Sarastro&#x27;s slaves, having tried to escape. Monostatos, a and chief of the slaves, orders them to chain her and leave her alone with him. Papageno, sent ahead by Tamino to help find Pamina, enters (Trio: &quot; / Just come in, you fine little dove!). Monostatos and Papageno are each terrified by the other&#x27;s strange appearance and both flee, each thinking the other is the devil. Papageno returns and announces to Pamina that her mother has sent Tamino to save her. Pamina rejoices to hear that Tamino is in love with her. She offers sympathy and hope to Papageno, who longs for a wife. Together they reflect on the joys and sacred value of marital love (duet: &quot; / In men, who feel love).

====Finale. Scene 3: A grove in front of a temple====

The three boys lead Tamino to Sarastro&#x27;s temple, promising that if he remains patient, wise and steadfast, he will succeed in rescuing Pamina (Quartet: &quot;&quot; / This path leads you to your goal). Tamino approaches the right-hand entrance (the Temple of Reason) and is denied access by voices from within. The same happens when he goes to the entrance on the left (the Temple of Nature). But from the entrance in the middle (the Temple of Wisdom), a senior priest appears. (The priest is referred to as &quot;The Speaker&quot; in the libretto, but his role is sung.) He tells Tamino that Sarastro is benevolent, not evil, and that he should not trust the Queen of the Night. With a hidden male chorus, he promises that Tamino&#x27;s confusion will be lifted when he approaches the temple in a spirit of friendship, and that Pamina is alive. Tamino plays his magic flute. Animals appear and dance, enraptured, to his music. Tamino hears Papageno&#x27;s pipes sounding offstage, and hurries off to find him (aria: &quot; / How strong is thy magic tone).
Papageno and Pamina enter, searching for Tamino (trio: &quot; / Swift steps, ready courage). They are recaptured by Monostatos and his slaves. Papageno plays his magic bells, causing Monostatos and his slaves to dance off the stage, mesmerised by the beauty of the music (chorus: &quot; / That sounds so splendid). Papageno and Pamina hear the sound of Sarastro&#x27;s retinue approaching. Papageno is frightened and asks Pamina what they should say. She answers that they must tell the truth. Sarastro enters, with a crowd of followers. (chorus: &quot; / Long live Sarastro!) Pamina falls at Sarastro&#x27;s feet and confesses that she tried to escape because Monostatos had forced his attentions on her. Sarastro receives her kindly and assures her that he wishes only for her happiness, but he refuses to return her to her mother, whom he describes as a proud, headstrong woman, and a bad influence on those around her. Pamina, he says, must be guided by a man.

Monostatos brings in Tamino. The two lovers see one another for the first time and embrace, causing indignation among Sarastro&#x27;s followers. Monostatos tells Sarastro that he caught Papageno and Pamina trying to escape, and demands a reward. Sarastro ironically &quot;rewards&quot; Monostatos with a beating and sends him away. He announces that Tamino and Pamina must both undergo trials to be purified. The priests declare that virtue and righteousness will sanctify life and make mortals like gods (&quot;&quot; / If virtue and justice).

===Act 2===

====Scene 1: A grove of palms====
The council of priests of Isis and Osiris, headed by Sarastro, enters to the sound of a solemn march. Sarastro tells the priests that Tamino is ready to undergo the ordeals that will lead to enlightenment. He invokes the gods Isis and Osiris, asking them to protect Tamino and Pamina (Aria and chorus: &quot; / O Isis and Osiris&quot;).

====Scene 2: The courtyard of the Temple of Ordeal====
Tamino and Papageno are led in by two priests for the first trial. The two priests advise Tamino and Papageno of the dangers ahead of them, warn them of women&#x27;s wiles and swear them to silence (Duet: &quot; / Keep yourselves from women&#x27;s tricks). The three ladies appear and remind Tamino and Papageno of what the Queen has said about Sarastro, trying to tempt them into speaking. (Quintet: &quot; / How, how, how) Papageno cannot resist answering the ladies, but Tamino remains aloof, angrily instructing Papageno not to listen to the ladies&#x27; threats and to keep quiet. Seeing that Tamino will not speak to them, the ladies withdraw in confusion. The Speaker and a priest return and lead Tamino and Papageno away.

====Scene 3: A garden====
Pamina is asleep. Monostatos creeps in and ogles her. (Aria: &quot; / All feel the joys of love) He is about to kiss her, when the Queen of the Night appears. Monostatos hides. Waking, Pamina tells her that Tamino is joining Sarastro&#x27;s brotherhood and that she is thinking of accompanying him. The Queen is not pleased. She explains that her husband, the previous owner of the temple, on his deathbed gave the ownership to Sarastro instead of to her, rendering the Queen powerless (this is in the original libretto, but is usually omitted from modern productions). She gives Pamina a dagger, ordering her to kill Sarastro with it and threatening to disown her if she does not. (Aria: &quot; / Hell&#x27;s vengeance boils in my heart). She leaves. Monostatos returns and tries to force Pamina&#x27;s love by threatening to reveal the Queen&#x27;s plot, but Sarastro enters and drives him off. Pamina begs Sarastro to forgive her mother and he reassures her that revenge and cruelty have no place in his domain (Aria: &quot; / Within these sacred halls).

====Scene 4: A hall in the Temple of Ordeal====

Tamino and Papageno are led in by priests, who remind them that they must remain silent. Papageno complains of thirst. An old woman enters and offers Papageno a cup of water. He drinks and teasingly asks whether she has a boyfriend. She replies that she does and that his name is Papageno. She disappears as Papageno asks for her name, and the three boys bring in food, the magic flute, and the bells, sent from Sarastro (Trio: &quot; / We welcome you a second time). Tamino begins to play the flute, which summons Pamina. She tries to speak with him, but Tamino, bound by his vow of silence, cannot answer her, and Pamina begins to believe that he no longer loves her. (Aria: &quot; / Oh, I feel it, it is gone) She leaves in despair.

====Scene 5: The pyramids====
The priests celebrate Tamino&#x27;s successes so far, and pray that he will succeed and become worthy of their order (Chorus: &quot; / O Isis and Osiris). Pamina is brought in and Sarastro instructs Pamina and Tamino to bid each other farewell before the greater trials ahead, alarming them by describing it as their &quot;final farewell&quot;. (Trio: Sarastro, Pamina, Tamino – &quot; / Shall I see you no more, dear one? — Note: In order to preserve the continuity of Pamina&#x27;s suicidal feelings, this trio is sometimes performed earlier in act 2, preceding or immediately following the chorus &quot;.) They exit and Papageno enters. The priests grant his request for a glass of wine and he expresses his desire for a wife. (Aria: &quot; / A girl or a woman). The elderly woman reappears and warns him that unless he immediately promises to marry her, he will be imprisoned forever. When Papageno promises to love her faithfully (muttering that he will only do this until something better comes along), she is transformed into the young and pretty Papagena. Papageno rushes to embrace her, but the priests drive him back, telling him that he is not yet worthy of her.

====Finale. Scene 6: A garden====
The three boys hail the dawn. They observe Pamina, who is contemplating suicide because she believes Tamino has abandoned her. The boys restrain her and reassure her of Tamino&#x27;s love. (Quartet: &quot; / To herald the morning, soon will shine). The scene changes without a break, leading into scene 7.

====Scene 7: At the Mountains of Ordeal====

(One mountain has a waterfall, the other emits fire.) Two men in armor lead Tamino in. They promise enlightenment to those who successfully overcome the fear of death (&quot;&quot; / He who walks this path weighed down with cares – sung to a Baroque chorale prelude, inspired by Martin Luther&#x27;s hymn &quot;Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein&quot; / Oh God, look down from heaven). Tamino declares that he is ready to be tested. Pamina calls to him from offstage. The men in armour assure him that the trial by silence is over and he is free to speak with her. Pamina enters and declares her intention to undergo the remaining trials with him. She hands him the magic flute to help them through the trials (&quot; / Oh, what luck, my Tamino!&quot;). Protected by the music of the magic flute, they pass unscathed through fire and water. Offstage, the priests hail their triumph and invite the couple to enter the temple. The scene changes without a break, leading into scene 8.

====Scene 8: A garden with a tree ====

Papageno despairs at having lost Papagena and decides to hang himself (Aria/Quartet: &quot;&quot; / Papagena! Papagena! Papagena! Dear woman, dear dove, my beauty) He hesitates, counting to three, but more and more slowly. The three boys appear and stop him. They remind him he can play his magic bells to summon Papagena. She appears and, united, the happy couple stutter in astonishment and make bird-like courting sounds at each other. They plan their future and dream of the many children they will have together (Duet: &quot;Pa... pa... pa...&quot;). The scenes change without a break, leading into scene 9.

====Scene 9: A rocky landscape outside the temple; night====
Monostatos appears with the Queen of the Night and her three ladies. They plot to destroy the temple (&quot;&quot; / Just quiet, quiet) and the Queen confirms her promise to give Pamina to Monostatos, but suddenly, with thunder and lightning, they are cast out into eternal night. The scene changes without a break, leading into scene 10.

====Scene 10: The Temple of the Sun====
Sarastro announces the sun&#x27;s triumph over the night and the fraudulent power of hypocrites. The chorus hails the newly consecrated Tamino and Pamina, and gives thanks to Isis and Osiris.

== Musical numbers ==
==Recordings==
The first known recording of &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;″s overture was issued around 1903, by the Victor Talking Machine Company and played by the Victor Grand Concert Band.

The first complete recording of &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; was of a live performance at the 1937 Salzburg Festival, with Arturo Toscanini conducting the Vienna Philharmonic and Vienna State Opera, though the recording was not officially issued until many years later. The first studio recording of the work, with Sir Thomas Beecham conducting the Berlin Philharmonic, was completed in 1938. Both of these historic recordings have been reissued on LP and compact disc. Since then there have been many recordings, in both audio and video formats.

<doc id="37924" wikidata="Q208659" url="?curid=37924" title="The Barber of Seville">
<text>The Barber of Seville, or The Useless Precaution ( ) is an &quot;opera buffa&quot; (comic opera) in two acts composed by Gioachino Rossini with an Italian libretto by Cesare Sterbini. The libretto was based on Pierre Beaumarchais&#x27;s French comedy &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; (1775). The première of Rossini&#x27;s opera (under the title &quot;Almaviva, o sia L&#x27;inutile precauzione&quot;) took place on 20 February 1816 at the Teatro Argentina, Rome, with designs by Angelo Toselli.

Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Barber of Seville&quot; is considered to be one of the greatest masterpieces of comedy within music, and has been described as the opera buffa of all &quot;opere buffe&quot;. After two centuries, it remains a popular work.

==Composition history==

Rossini&#x27;s opera recounts the events of the first of the three plays by French playwright Pierre Beaumarchais that revolve around the clever and enterprising character named Figaro, the barber of the title. Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;The Marriage of Figaro,&quot; composed 30 years earlier in 1786, is based on the second part of the Beaumarchais trilogy. (This play was originally conceived as an opéra comique, but was rejected as such by the Comédie-Italienne.) The play as it is now known was premiered in 1775 by the Comédie-Française at the Théâtre des Tuileries in Paris.

Other operas based on the first play were composed by Giovanni Paisiello (in 1782), by Nicolas Isouard in 1796, and then by Francesco Morlacchi in 1816. Though the work of Paisiello triumphed for a time, only Rossini&#x27;s version has stood the test of time and continues to be a mainstay of operatic repertoire. On 11 November 1868, two days before Rossini&#x27;s death, the composer (1842–1877) premiered an opera based on the same libretto as Rossini&#x27;s work, bearing a dedication to Rossini. The premiere was not a failure, but critics condemned the &quot;audacity&quot; of the young composer and the work is now forgotten.

Rossini was well known for being remarkably productive, completing an average of two operas per year for 19 years, and in some years writing as many as four. Musicologists believe that, true to form, the music for &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot; was composed in just under three weeks, although the famous overture was actually recycled from two earlier Rossini operas, &quot;Aureliano in Palmira&quot; and &quot;Elizabeth, Queen of England&quot; and thus contains none of the thematic material in &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot; itself.

==Performance history==
Luigi Zamboni, for whom Rossini wrote the role of Figaro, had urged Rossini and Francesco Sforza-Cesarini, the cash-strapped impresario of the Teatro Argentina, to engage his sister-in-law, Elisabetta Gafforini, as Rosina. However, her fee was too high and in the end they settled on Geltrude Righetti. The premiere of Rossini&#x27;s opera at the Teatro Argentina in Rome on 20 February 1816 was a disaster: the audience hissed and jeered throughout, and several on-stage accidents occurred. Furthermore, many of the audience were supporters of one of Rossini&#x27;s rivals, the veteran Giovanni Paisiello, who played on mob mentality to provoke the rest of the audience to dislike the opera. Paisiello had already composed &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; and took Rossini&#x27;s new version to be an affront to his version. In particular, Paisiello&#x27;s admirers were displeased with the latter inasmuch as they &quot;were used in the way of buffo music to the style in which the pathetic often mingles with and sometimes effaces the comic&quot;. The second performance, however, was successful. The original French play, &quot;Le Barbier de Séville&quot;, had a similar story: poorly received at first, only to become a favorite within a week.

The opera was first performed in England on 10 March 1818 at the King&#x27;s Theatre in London in Italian, soon followed on 13 October at the Covent Garden Theatre by an English version translated by John Fawcett and Daniel Terry. It was first performed in America on 3 May 1819 in English (probably the Covent Garden version) at the Park Theatre in New York. It was given in French at the Théâtre d&#x27;Orléans in New Orleans on 4 March 1823, and became the first opera ever to be performed in Italian in New York, when Manuel Garcia (who played Almaviva) and his Italian troupe opened their first season there with &quot;Il barbiere&quot; on 29 November 1825 at the Park Theatre. The cast of eight had three other members of his family, including the 17-year-old Maria-Felicia, later known as Maria Malibran.

The role of Rosina was originally written for a contralto. According to music critic Richard Osborne, writing in &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Opera&quot;, &quot;it is important to record the degree to which singers have sometimes distorted Rossini&#x27;s intentions. The most serious distortion has been the upward transposition of the role of Rosina, turning her from a lustrous alto into a pert soprano.&quot; However, it has also been noted that Rossini, who frequently altered his music for specific singers, wrote a new aria for the second act for Joséphine Fodor-Mainvielle, a soprano who had sung Rosina in the 1818 London premiere, and sang the new aria c. 1820 at the Théâtre-Italien in Paris, where it was published. According to Alberto Zedda, the author of the first critical edition of the opera, &#x27;the transposition of the part of Rosina from contralto to soprano entails the need to transfer to a lower voice the role of the seconda donna, Berta, written by Rossini for a soprano voice. A mezzo-soprano Berta will find the tessitura of her aria &quot;Il vecchiotto cerca moglie&quot; uncomfortable, and the climb to C6 required at the conclusion of the grand concertato of the first-act finale rather difficult to achieve&#x27;.

The singing lesson in act 2 has often been turned into &quot;a show-stopping cabaret&quot;. Adelina Patti was known to include Luigi Arditi&#x27;s &quot;Il bacio&quot;, the Bolero from Verdi&#x27;s &quot;I vespri siciliani&quot;, the Shadow Song from Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Dinorah&quot;, and Henry Bishop&#x27;s &quot;Home! Sweet Home!&quot;. Nellie Melba followed suit, accompanying herself on the piano in the final song. Pauline Viardot began the practice of inserting Alexander Alyabyev&#x27;s &quot;Nightingale&quot;. In a recording of a La Scala performance in 1956, Maria Callas sang a shortened version of &quot;Contro un cor&quot;, transposed up a tone, in E.

Once after Patti had sung a particularly florid rendition of the opera&#x27;s legitimate aria, &quot;Una voce poco fa&quot;, Rossini is reported to have asked her: &quot;Very nice, my dear, and who wrote the piece you have just performed?&quot;

The piece is a staple of the operatic repertoire Because of a scarcity of true contraltos, the role of Rosina has most frequently been sung by a coloratura mezzo-soprano (with or without pitch alterations, depending on the singer), and has in the past, and occasionally in more recent times, been sung by coloratura sopranos such as Marcella Sembrich, Maria Callas, Roberta Peters, Gianna D&#x27;Angelo, Victoria de los Ángeles, Beverly Sills, Lily Pons, Diana Damrau, Edita Gruberová, Kathleen Battle and Luciana Serra. Famous recent mezzo-soprano Rosinas include Marilyn Horne, Teresa Berganza, Frederica von Stade, Lucia Valentini Terrani, Susanne Marsee, Cecilia Bartoli, Joyce DiDonato, Jennifer Larmore, Elīna Garanča, Isabel Leonard and Vesselina Kasarova. Famous contralto Rosinas include Ewa Podleś who made her stage debut in that role.

==Synopsis==
:Place: Seville, Spain
:Time: 17th century

===Act 1===
&quot;The square in front of Bartolo&#x27;s house&quot;

In a public square outside Bartolo&#x27;s house a band of musicians and a poor student named Lindoro are serenading, to no avail, the window of Rosina (&quot;Ecco, ridente in cielo&quot;; &quot;There, laughing in the sky&quot;). Lindoro, who is really the young Count Almaviva in disguise, hopes to make the beautiful Rosina love him for himself – not his money. Almaviva pays off the musicians who then depart, leaving him to brood alone. Rosina is the young ward of the grumpy, elderly Bartolo and she is allowed very little freedom because Bartolo plans to marry her once she is of age and thus appropriate her considerable dowry. 

Figaro approaches singing (Aria: &quot;Largo al factotum della città&quot;; &quot;Make way for the of the city&quot;). Since Figaro used to be a servant of the Count, the Count asks him for assistance in helping him meet Rosina, offering him money should he be successful in arranging this (duet: &quot;All&#x27;idea di quel metallo&quot;; &quot;At the idea of that metal&quot;). Figaro advises the Count to disguise himself as a drunken soldier, ordered to be billeted with Bartolo, so as to gain entrance to the house. For this suggestion, Figaro is richly rewarded.
&quot;A room in Bartolo&#x27;s house with four doors&quot;

The scene begins with Rosina&#x27;s cavatina, &quot;Una voce poco fa&quot; (&quot;A voice a little while ago&quot;). (This aria was originally written in the key of E major, but it is sometimes transposed a semitone up into F major for coloratura sopranos to perform, giving them the chance to sing extra, almost traditional, cadenzas, sometimes reaching high Ds or even Fs.)

Knowing the Count only as Lindoro, Rosina writes to him because she is interested in getting to know him better. As she is leaving the room, Bartolo enters with the music teacher Basilio. Bartolo is suspicious of the Count, and Basilio advises that he be put out of the way by creating false rumours about him (this aria, &quot;La calunnia è un venticello&quot; – &quot;Calumny is a little breeze&quot; – is almost always sung a tone lower than the original D major).

When the two have gone, Rosina and Figaro enter. Figaro asks Rosina to write a few encouraging words to Lindoro, which she has actually already written. (Duet: &quot;Dunque io son...tu non m&#x27;inganni?&quot;; &quot;Then I&#x27;m the one...you&#x27;re not fooling me?&quot;). Although surprised by Bartolo, Rosina manages to fool him, but he remains suspicious. (Aria: &quot;A un dottor della mia sorte&quot;; &quot;To a doctor of my class&quot;).

Count Almaviva, disguised as a soldier and pretending to be drunk, enters the house and demands to be quartered there. In fear of the drunken man, Berta the housekeeper rushes to Bartolo for protection. Bartolo tells the &quot;soldier&quot; that he (Bartolo) has an official exemption which excuses him from the requirement to quarter soldiers in his home. Almaviva pretends to be too drunk and belligerent to understand, and dares Bartolo to brawl. While Bartolo searches his cluttered desk for the official document which would prove his exemption, Almaviva whispers to Rosina that he is Lindoro in disguise, and passes a love-letter to her. Bartolo suspiciously demands to know what is in the piece of paper in Rosina&#x27;s hands, but she fools him by handing over her laundry list. Bartolo and the Count argue loudly. Basilio enters; then Figaro, who warns that the noise of the argument is rousing the whole neighborhood. Finally, the noise attracts the attention of the Officer of the Watch and his troops, who crowd into the room. Bartolo demands that the Officer arrest the &quot;drunken soldier&quot;. The Officer starts to do so, but Almaviva quietly reveals his true identity to the Officer, and he (the Officer) backs off. Bartolo and Basilio are astonished and mystified; Figaro laughs quietly at them. (Finale: &quot;Fredda ed immobile, come una statua&quot;; &quot;Cold and still, just like a statue&quot;). The confusion intensifies and causes everyone to suffer headaches and auditory hallucinations (&quot;Mi par d&#x27;esser con la testa in un&#x27;orrida fucina; dell&#x27;incudini sonore l&#x27;importuno strepitar&quot;; &quot;My head seems to be in a fiery forge: the sound of the anvils deafens the ear&quot;).

===Act 2===
&quot;A room in Bartolo&#x27;s house with a piano&quot;

Count Almaviva again appears at the doctor&#x27;s house, this time disguised as Don Alonso, a priest and singing tutor who is substituting for the supposedly ailing Basilio. To gain Bartolo&#x27;s trust, Don Alonso tells him he has intercepted a note from Lindoro to Rosina, and says that Lindoro is a servant of Count Almaviva who has dishonorable intentions towards Rosina. While Almaviva pretends to give Rosina her singing lesson (&quot;Contro un cor&quot;; &quot;Against a heart&quot;), Figaro arrives to shave Bartolo. Not wanting to leave Rosina alone with the singing teacher, Bartolo insists Figaro shave him right there in the music room. Basilio suddenly appears for his scheduled music lesson, but he is bribed by a full purse from Almaviva and persuaded to leave again, with much discussion of how ill he looks. (Quintet: &quot;Don Basilio! – Cosa veggo!&quot;; &quot;Don Basilio! – What do I see?&quot;). Bartolo overhears the lovers conspiring, and angrily drives everybody away. Berta vents about the crazy household (&quot;Il vecchiotto cerca moglie&quot;).

&quot;A room in Bartolo&#x27;s house&quot; &quot;with a grille looking out onto the square&quot;. 

Bartolo orders Basilio to have the notary ready to marry him to Rosina that evening. Basilio leaves and Rosina arrives. Bartolo shows Rosina the letter she wrote to &quot;Lindoro&quot; and persuades her that this is proof that Lindoro is merely a flunky of Almaviva and is toying with her at Almaviva&#x27;s behest. Rosina believes the story and agrees to marry Bartolo.

During an instrumental interlude, the music creates a thunder storm to indicate the passage of time. Almaviva and Figaro climb up a ladder to the balcony and enter Rosina&#x27;s room through a window. Rosina accuses Almaviva, whom she believes to be Lindoro, of betraying her. Almaviva reveals his identity and the two reconcile. While Almaviva and Rosina are enraptured by one another, Figaro keeps urging them to leave. Two people are heard approaching the front door. They are Basilio and the notary. The Count, Rosina, and Figaro attempt to leave by way of the ladder, but discover it has been removed. Using bribes and threats, Almaviva coerces the notary into marrying him to Rosina, with Basilio and Figaro as the legally required witnesses. Bartolo barges in, accompanied by the Officer and the men of the watch, but too late; the marriage is already complete. The befuddled Bartolo is pacified by being allowed to retain Rosina&#x27;s dowry. The opera concludes with an anthem to love (&quot;Amor e fede eterna, si vegga in noi regnar!&quot;; &quot;May love and faith eternally be seen to reign in us&quot;).

<doc id="37929" wikidata="Q188621" url="?curid=37929" title="La bohème">
<text>La bohème ( , ) is an opera in four acts, composed by Giacomo Puccini between 1893 and 1895 to an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa, based on &quot;Scènes de la vie de bohème&quot; (1851) by Henri Murger. The story is set in Paris around 1830 and shows the Bohemian lifestyle (known in French as &quot;&quot;) of a poor seamstress and her artist friends.

The world premiere of &quot;La bohème&quot; was in Turin on 1 February 1896 at the Teatro Regio, conducted by the 28-year-old Arturo Toscanini. Since then, &quot;La bohème&quot; has become part of the standard Italian opera repertory and is one of the most frequently performed operas worldwide.

In 1946, 50 years after the opera&#x27;s premiere, Toscanini conducted a commemorative performance of it on radio with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. A recording of the performance was later released by RCA Victor on vinyl record, tape and compact disc. It is the only recording ever made of a Puccini opera by its original conductor.

==Origin of the story==

As credited on its title page, the libretto of &quot;La bohème&quot; is based on Henri Murger&#x27;s 1851 novel, &quot;Scènes de la vie de bohème&quot;, a collection of vignettes portraying young bohemians living in the Latin Quarter of Paris in the 1840s. Although often called a novel, the book has no unified plot. Like the 1849 play drawn from the book by Murger and Théodore Barrière, the opera&#x27;s libretto focuses on the relationship between Rodolfo and Mimì, ending with her death. Also like the play, the libretto combines two characters from the novel, Mimì and Francine, into the single character of Mimì. Early in the composition stage Puccini was in dispute with the composer Ruggero Leoncavallo, who said that he had offered Puccini a completed libretto and felt that Puccini should defer to him. Puccini responded that he had had no idea of Leoncavallo&#x27;s interest and that having been working on his own version for some time, he felt that he could not oblige him by abandoning the opera. Leoncavallo completed his own version in which Marcello was sung by a tenor and Rodolfo by a baritone. It was not as successful as Puccini&#x27;s and is now rarely performed.

Much of the libretto is original. Major sections of acts two and three are the librettists&#x27; invention, with only a few passing references to incidents and characters in Murger. Most of acts one and four follow the book, piecing together episodes from various chapters. The final scenes in acts one and four—the scenes with Rodolfo and Mimì—resemble both the play and the book. The story of their meeting closely follows chapter 18 of the book, in which the two lovers living in the garret are not Rodolphe and Mimì at all, but rather Jacques and Francine. The story of Mimì&#x27;s death in the opera draws from two different chapters in the book, one relating Francine&#x27;s death and the other relating Mimì&#x27;s.

The published libretto includes a note from the librettists briefly discussing their adaptation. Without mentioning the play directly, they defend their conflation of Francine and Mimì into a single character: &quot;Chi può non confondere nel delicato profilo di una sola donna quelli di Mimì e di Francine?&quot; (&quot;Who cannot confuse in the delicate profile of one woman the personality both of Mimì and of Francine?&quot;). At the time, the book was in the public domain, Murger having died without heirs, but rights to the play were still controlled by Barrière&#x27;s heirs.

==Performance history and reception ==

===Initial success===
The world première performance of &quot;La bohème&quot; took place in Turin on 1 February 1896 at the Teatro Regio and was conducted by the young Arturo Toscanini. The role of Rodolfo was played by Evan Gorga with Cesira Ferrani as Mimi, but Gorga was unable to accommodate the high tessitura and the music had to be transposed down for him. The initial response of the audience at the first performance was subdued and critical responses were polarized. Despite this varied introductory response, the opera quickly became popular throughout Italy and productions were soon mounted by the following companies: The Teatro di San Carlo (14 March 1896, with Elisa Petri as Musetta and Antonio Magini-Coletti as Marcello); The Teatro Comunale di Bologna (4 November 1896, with Amelia Sedelmayer as Musetta and Umberto Beduschi as Rodolfo); The Teatro Costanzi (17 November 1896, with Maria Stuarda Savelli as Mimì, Enrico Giannini-Grifoni as Rodolfo, and Maurizio Bensaude as Marcello); La Scala (15 March 1897, with Angelica Pandolfini as Mimì, Camilla Pasini as Musetta, Fernando De Lucia as Rodolfo, and Edoardo Camera as Marcello); La Fenice (26 December 1897, with Emilia Merolla as Mimì, Maria Martelli as Musetta, Giovanni Apostolu and Franco Mannucci as Rodolfo, and Ferruccio Corradetti as Marcello); Teatro Regio di Parma (29 January 1898, with Solomiya Krushelnytska as Mimì, Lina Cassandro as Musetta, Pietro Ferrari as Rodolfo, and Pietro Giacomello as Marcello); Paris Opera (13 June 1898); and the Teatro Donizetti di Bergamo (21 August 1898, with Emilia Corsi as Mimì, Annita Barone as Musetta, Giovanni Apostolu as Rodolfo, and Giovanni Roussel as Marcello).

The first performance of &quot;La bohème&quot; outside Italy was at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 16 June 1896. The opera was performed in Alexandria, Lisbon, and Moscow in early 1897. The United Kingdom premiere took place at the Theatre Royal in Manchester, on 22 April 1897, in a presentation by the Carl Rosa Opera Company supervised by Puccini. This performance was given in English and starred Alice Esty as Mimì, Bessie McDonald as Musetta, Robert Cunningham as Rodolfo, and William Paull as Marcello. On 2 October 1897 the same company gave the opera&#x27;s first staging at the Royal Opera House in London and on 14 October 1897 in Los Angeles for the opera&#x27;s United States premiere. The opera reached New York City on 16 May 1898 when it was performed at Wallack&#x27;s Theatre with Giuseppe Agostini as Rodolfo. The first production of the opera actually produced by the Royal Opera House itself premiered on 1 July 1899 with Nellie Melba as Mimì, Zélie de Lussan as Musetta, Fernando De Lucia as Rodolfo, and Mario Ancona as Marcello.

&quot;La bohème&quot; premiered in Germany at the Kroll Opera House in Berlin on 22 June 1897. The French premiere of the opera was presented by the Opéra-Comique on 13 June 1898 at the Théâtre des Nations. The production used a French translation by Paul Ferrier and starred Julia Guiraudon as Mimì, Jeanne Tiphaine as Musetta, Adolphe Maréchal as Rodolfo, and Lucien Fugère as Marcello. The Czech premiere of the opera was presented by the National Theatre on 27 February 1898.

===20th and 21st centuries===
&quot;La bohème&quot; continued to gain international popularity throughout the early 20th century and the Opéra-Comique alone had already presented the opera one hundred times by 1903. The Belgian premiere took place at La Monnaie on 25 October 1900 using Ferrier&#x27;s French translation with Marie Thiérry as Mimì, Léon David as Rodolfo, Eugène-Charles Badiali as Marcello, sets by Pierre Devis, Armand Lynen, and Albert Dubosq, and Philippe Flon conducting. The Metropolitan Opera staged the work for the first time on 26 December 1900 with Nellie Melba as Mimì, Annita Occhiolini-Rizzini as Musetta, Albert Saléza as Rodolfo, Giuseppe Campanari as Marcello, and Luigi Mancinelli conducting. &quot;La bohème&quot; was the last opera performed at New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s original 1883 building on 16 April 1966, conducted by George Schick.

The opera was first performed in Brazil at the Theatro da Paz in Belém on 21 April 1900 with the Brazilian soprano Tilde Maragliano as Mimì, Maria Cavallini as Musetta, Giuseppe Agostini as Rodolfo and Alessandro Modesti as Marcello. The conductor was Giorgio Polacco.

The following year &quot;La bohème&quot; was presented at the Teatro Amazonas in Manaus, Brazil, on 2 July 1901 with Elvira Miotti as Mimì, Mabel Nelma as Musetta, Michele Sigaldi as Rodolfo, and Enrico De Franceschi as Marcello. Other premieres soon followed:
* Melbourne: 13 July 1901 (Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre; first performance in Australia)
* Monaco: 1 February 1902, Opéra de Monte-Carlo in Monte Carlo with Nellie Melba as Mimì, Enrico Caruso as Rodolfo, Alexis Boyer as Marcello, and Léon Jehin conducting.
* Prato: 25 December 1902, Regio Teatro Metastasio with Ulderica Persichini as Mimì, Norma Sella as Musetta, Ariodante Quarti as Rodolfo, and Amleto Pollastri as Marcello.
* Catania: 9 July 1903, Politeama Pacini with Isabella Costa Orbellini as Mimì, Lina Gismondi as Musetta, Elvino Ventura as Rodolfo, and Alfredo Costa as Marcello.
* Austria: 25 November 1903, Vienna State Opera in Vienna with Selma Kurz as Mimì, Marie Gutheil-Schoder as Musetta, Fritz Schrödter as Rodolfo, Gerhard Stehmann as Marcello, and Gustav Mahler conducting.
* Sweden: 19 May 1905, Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm, presented by the Royal Swedish Opera with Maria Labia as Mimì.

Puccini died in Brussels on 29 November 1924, and the news of his death reached Rome during a performance of &quot;La bohème&quot;. The opera was immediately stopped, and the orchestra played Chopin&#x27;s &quot;Funeral March&quot; for the stunned audience.

The first production of &quot;La bohème&quot; at the Salzburg Festival did not occur until as late as July 2012. However, that festival has not shown much interest in the operas of Puccini, only ever having one production each of &quot;Tosca&quot; and &quot;Turandot&quot; in its entire history.

===Critical reception===
Despite the opera&#x27;s popularity with audiences, Puccini has been the target of condescension by some music critics who find his music insufficiently sophisticated or difficult. The composer Benjamin Britten wrote in 1951, &quot;[A]fter four or five performances I never wanted to hear &quot;Bohème&quot; again. In spite of its neatness, I became sickened by the cheapness and emptiness of the music.&quot;

==Roles==

== Synopsis ==
:Place: Paris
:Time: Around 1830.

===Act 1===

&quot;In the four bohemians&#x27; garret (Christmas Eve)&quot;

Marcello is painting while Rodolfo gazes out of the window. They complain of the cold. In order to keep warm, they burn the manuscript of Rodolfo&#x27;s drama. Colline, the philosopher, enters shivering and disgruntled at not having been able to pawn some books. Schaunard, the musician of the group, arrives with food, wine and cigars. He explains the source of his riches: a job with an eccentric English gentleman, who hired him to play his violin to a parrot until it died. The others hardly listen to his tale as they set up the table to eat and drink. Schaunard interrupts, telling them that they must save the food for the days ahead: tonight they will all celebrate his good fortune by dining at Cafe Momus, and he will pay.

The friends are interrupted by Benoît, the landlord, who arrives to collect the rent. They flatter him and him with wine. In his drunkenness, he begins to boast of his amorous adventures, but when he also reveals that he is married, they thrust him from the room—without the rent payment—in comic moral indignation. The rent money is divided for their evening out in the &quot;Quartier Latin&quot;.
Marcello, Schaunard and Colline go out, but Rodolfo remains alone for a moment in order to finish an article he is writing, promising to join his friends soon. There is a knock at the door. It is a girl who lives in another room in the building. Her candle has blown out, and she has no matches; she asks Rodolfo to light it. She is briefly overcome with faintness, and Rodolfo helps her to a chair and offers her a glass of wine. She thanks him. After a few minutes, she says that she is better and must go. But as she turns to leave, she realizes that she has lost her key.

Her candle goes out in the draught and Rodolfo&#x27;s candle goes out too; the pair stumble in the dark. Rodolfo, eager to spend time with the girl, to whom he is already attracted, finds the key and pockets it, feigning innocence. He takes her cold hand (&quot;Che gelida manina&quot;—&quot;What a cold little hand&quot;) and tells her of his life as a poet, then asks her to tell him more about her life. The girl says her name is Mimì (&quot;Sì, mi chiamano Mimì&quot;—&quot;Yes, they call me Mimì&quot;), and describes her simple life as an embroiderer. Impatiently, the waiting friends call Rodolfo. He answers and turns to see Mimì bathed in moonlight (duet, Rodolfo and Mimì: &quot;O soave fanciulla&quot;—&quot;Oh lovely girl&quot;). They realize that they have fallen in love. Rodolfo suggests remaining at home with Mimì, but she decides to accompany him to the Cafe Momus. As they leave, they sing of their newfound love.

===Act 2===
&quot;Quartier Latin (same evening)&quot;

A great crowd, including children, has gathered with street sellers announcing their wares (chorus: &quot;Aranci, datteri! Caldi i marroni!&quot;—&quot;Oranges, dates! Hot chestnuts!&quot;). The friends arrive; Rodolfo buys Mimì a bonnet from a vendor, while Colline buys a coat and Schaunard a horn. Parisians gossip with friends and bargain with the vendors; the children of the streets clamor to see the wares of Parpignol, the toy seller. The friends enter the Cafe Momus.

As the men and Mimì dine at the cafe, Musetta, Marcello&#x27;s former sweetheart, arrives with her rich (and elderly) government minister admirer, Alcindoro, whom she is tormenting. It is clear she is tired of him. To the delight of the Parisians and the embarrassment of her patron, she sings a risqué song (Musetta&#x27;s waltz: &quot;Quando me&#x27;n vo&#x27;&quot;—&quot;When I go along&quot;), hoping to reclaim Marcello&#x27;s attention. The ploy works; at the same time, Mimì recognizes that Musetta truly loves Marcello. To be rid of Alcindoro for a bit, Musetta pretends to be suffering from a tight shoe and sends him to the shoemaker to get her shoe mended. Alcindoro leaves, and Musetta and Marcello fall rapturously into each other&#x27;s arms.

The friends are presented with their bill. However, Schaunard&#x27;s purse has gone missing and no one else has enough money to pay. The sly Musetta has the entire bill charged to Alcindoro. The sound of a military band is heard, and the friends leave. Alcindoro returns with the repaired shoe seeking Musetta. The waiter hands him the bill and, dumbfounded, Alcindoro sinks into a chair.

===Act 3===

&quot;At the toll gate at the Barrière d&#x27;Enfer (late February)&quot;

Peddlers pass through the barriers and enter the city. Mimì appears, coughing violently. She tries to find Marcello, who is currently living in a little tavern where he paints signs for the innkeeper. She tells him of her hard life with Rodolfo, who abandoned her the night before, and of Rodolfo&#x27;s terrible jealousy (&quot;O buon Marcello, aiuto!&quot;—&quot;Oh, good Marcello, help me!&quot;). Marcello tells her that Rodolfo is asleep inside, and expresses concern about Mimì&#x27;s cough. Rodolfo wakes up and comes out looking for Marcello. Mimì hides and overhears Rodolfo first telling Marcello that he left Mimì because of her coquettishness, but finally confessing that his jealousy is a sham: he fears she is slowly being consumed by a deadly illness (most likely tuberculosis, known by the catchall name &quot;consumption&quot; in the nineteenth century). Rodolfo, in his poverty, can do little to help Mimì and hopes that his pretended unkindness will inspire her to seek another, wealthier suitor (&quot;Marcello, finalmente&quot;—&quot;Marcello, finally&quot;).
Out of kindness towards Mimì, Marcello tries to silence him, but she has already heard all. Her weeping and coughing reveal her presence, and Rodolfo hurries to her. Musetta&#x27;s laughter is heard and Marcello goes to find out what has happened. Mimì tells Rodolfo that she is leaving him, and asks that they separate amicably (Mimì: &quot;Donde lieta uscì&quot;—&quot;From here she happily left&quot;); but their love for one another is too strong for the pair to part. As a compromise, they agree to remain together until the spring, when the world is coming to life again and no one feels truly alone. Meanwhile, Marcello has found Musetta, and the couple quarrel fiercely about Musetta&#x27;s flirtatiousness (quartet: Mimì, Rodolfo, Musetta, Marcello: &quot;Addio dolce svegliare alla mattina!&quot;—&quot;Goodbye, sweet awakening in the morning!&quot;).

===Act 4===
&quot;Back in the garret (some months later)&quot;

Marcello and Rodolfo are trying to work, though they are primarily talking about their girlfriends, who have left them and found wealthy lovers. Rodolfo has seen Musetta in a fine carriage and Marcello has seen Mimì dressed like a queen. The men both express their nostalgia (duet: &quot;O Mimì, tu più non torni&quot;—&quot;O Mimì, will you not return?&quot;). Schaunard and Colline arrive with a very frugal dinner and all parody eating a plentiful banquet, dance together and sing, before Schaunard and Colline engage in a mock duel.

Musetta suddenly appears; Mimì, who took up with a wealthy viscount after leaving Rodolfo in the spring, has left her patron. Musetta found her that day in the street, severely weakened by her illness, and Mimì begged Musetta to bring her to Rodolfo. Mimì, haggard and pale, is assisted onto a bed. Briefly, she feels as though she is recovering. Musetta and Marcello leave to sell Musetta&#x27;s earrings in order to buy medicine, and Colline leaves to pawn his overcoat (&quot;Vecchia zimarra&quot;—&quot;Old coat&quot;). Schaunard leaves with Colline to give Mimì and Rodolfo some time together. Mimì tells Rodolfo that her love for him is her whole life (aria/duet, Mimì and Rodolfo: &quot;Sono andati?&quot;—&quot;Have they gone?&quot;).

To Mimì&#x27;s delight, Rodolfo presents her with the pink bonnet he bought her, which he has kept as a souvenir of their love. They remember past happiness and their first meeting—the candles, the lost key (Mimi playfully confesses that she had figured out that Rodolfo had pocketed it). Mimì is overwhelmed by a seizure of coughing. The others return, with a gift of a muff to warm Mimì&#x27;s hands and a cordial to soothe her cough. Mimì gently thanks Rodolfo for the muff, which she believes is a present from him, reassures him that she is better, and falls asleep. Musetta prays. Schaunard discovers that Mimì has died. Rodolfo rushes to the bed, calling Mimì&#x27;s name in anguish. He sobs helplessly as the curtain falls.

==Instrumentation==
&quot;La bohème&quot; is scored for:
* woodwinds: piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets (A, B-flat), bass clarinet (A, B-flat), 2 bassoons
* brass: 4 horns in F, 3 trumpets in F, 3 trombones, bass trombone

* off-stage (end of act 2): 4 piccolos, 6 trumpets, 2 snare drums (occasionally on-stage)

==Recording history==
The discography of &quot;La bohème&quot; is a long one with many distinguished recordings, including the 1972 Decca recording conducted by Herbert von Karajan with Luciano Pavarotti as Rodolfo and Mirella Freni as Mimì (made before Pavarotti became an international superstar of opera), and the 1973 RCA Victor recording conducted by Sir Georg Solti with Montserrat Caballé as Mimì and Plácido Domingo as Rodolfo which won the 1974 Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording. The 1959 recording conducted by Tullio Serafin with Renata Tebaldi as Mimì and Carlo Bergonzi was included in the soundtrack of the 1987 movie &quot;Moonstruck&quot;.

The earliest commercially released full-length recording was probably that recorded in February 1917 and released on His Master Voice&#x27;s Italian label La Voce del Padrone. Carlo Sabajno conducted the La Scala Orchestra and Chorus with Gemma Bosini and Reno Andreini as Mimì and Rodolfo. One of the most recent is the 2008 Deutsche Grammophon release conducted by Bertrand de Billy with Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazón as Mimì and Rodolfo.

There are several recordings with conductors closely associated with Puccini. In the 1946 RCA Victor recording, Arturo Toscanini, who conducted the world premiere of the opera, conducts the NBC Symphony Orchestra with Jan Peerce as Rodolfo and Licia Albanese as Mimì. It is the only recording of a Puccini opera by its original conductor. Thomas Beecham, who worked closely with Puccini when preparing a 1920 production of &quot;La bohème&quot; in London, conducted a performance of the opera in English released by Columbia Records in 1936 with Lisa Perli as Mimì and Heddle Nash as Rodolfo. Beecham also conducts on the 1956 RCA Victor recording with Victoria de los Ángeles and Jussi Björling as Mimì and Rodolfo.

Although the vast majority of recordings are in the original Italian, the opera has been recorded in several other languages. These include: a recording in French conducted by Erasmo Ghiglia with Renée Doria and Alain Vanzo as Mimì and Rodolfo (1960); a recording in German with Richard Kraus conducting the Deutsche Oper Berlin Orchestra and Chorus with Trude Eipperle and Fritz Wunderlich as Mimì and Rodolfo (1956); and the 1998 release on the Chandos Opera in English label with David Parry conducting the Philharmonia Orchestra and Cynthia Haymon and Dennis O&#x27;Neill as Mimì and Rodolfo.

Enrico Caruso, who was closely associated with the role of Rodolfo, recorded the famous aria &quot;Che gelida manina&quot; in 1906. This aria has been recorded by nearly 500 tenors in at least seven different languages between 1900 and 1980. In 1981 the A.N.N.A. Record Company released a six LP set with 101 different tenors singing the aria.

==The missing act==
In 1957 Illica&#x27;s widow died and his papers were given to the Parma Museum. Among them was the full libretto to &quot;La bohème&quot;. It was then discovered that the librettists had prepared an act which Puccini decided not to use in his composition. It is noteworthy for explaining Rodolfo&#x27;s jealous remarks to Marcello in act 3.

The &quot;missing act&quot; is located in the timeline between the Café Momus scene and act 3 and describes an open-air party at Musetta&#x27;s dwelling. Her protector has refused to pay further rent out of jealous feelings, and Musetta&#x27;s furniture is moved into the courtyard to be auctioned off the following morning. The four Bohemians find in this an excuse for a party and arrange for wine and an orchestra. Musetta gives Mimì a beautiful gown to wear and introduces her to a Viscount. The pair dances a quadrille in the courtyard, which moves Rodolfo to jealousy. This explains his act 3 reference to the &quot;moscardino di Viscontino&quot; (young fop of a Viscount). As dawn approaches, furniture dealers gradually remove pieces for the morning auction.

Ruggero Leoncavallo composed an opera based the same source material, also titled &quot;La bohème&quot;; this episode is included in Leoncavallo&#x27;s treatment which premiered in 1897.

==Derivative works==
In 1959 &quot;Musetta&#x27;s Waltz&quot; was adapted by songwriter Bobby Worth for the pop song &quot;Don&#x27;t You Know?&quot;, a hit for Della Reese. Earlier, it was used for another song, &quot;One Night of Love&quot;.

In 1969 in Paris, American free-jazz pianist Dave Burrell recorded his &quot;La Vie de Bohème&quot; with a seven-piece group of European and American musicians. The music on the double-LP is improvised and experimental, but the listener can still discern Puccini&#x27;s themes, as well as the narrative arc of the complete opera.

&quot;Rent&quot;, a 1996 musical by Jonathan Larson, is based on &quot;La bohème&quot;. Here the lovers, Roger and Mimi, are faced with AIDS and progress through the action with songs such as &quot;Light My Candle&quot;, which have direct reference to &quot;La bohème&quot;. Many of the character names are retained or are similar (e.g. the character Angel is given the surname &quot;Schunard&quot;), and at another point in the play, Roger&#x27;s roommate and best friend Mark makes a wry reference to &quot;Musetta&#x27;s Waltz&quot;, which is a recurring theme throughout the first act and is played at the end of the second act.

The opera was adapted into a 1983 short story by the novelist V. S. Pritchett for publication by the Metropolitan Opera Association.

===Modernizations===

Baz Luhrmann produced the opera for Opera Australia in 1990 with modernized supertitle translations, and a budget of only A$60,000 (A$130,545.17 in 2022). A DVD was issued of the stage show. According to Luhrmann, this version was set in 1957 (rather than the original period of 1830) because &quot;...[they] discovered that 1957 was a very, very accurate match for the social and economic realities of Paris in the 1840s.&quot; In 2002, Luhrmann restaged his version on Broadway, the production won two Tony Awards out of six nominations; for Best Scenic Design and Best Lighting Design as well as a special award, the Tony Honor for Excellence in Theatre. This rendition is notable for being the debut of Joe Jonas, who portrayed Oliver. To play the eight performances per week on Broadway, three casts of Mimìs and Rodolfos, and two Musettas and Marcellos, were used in rotation.

Jonathan Larson&#x27;s musical &quot;Rent&quot; was based on the play with modern names: Rodolfo is Roger, Colline is Collins, Schunard is Angel, Benoit is Benny, etc. The story is set amongst artists living in New York City at the end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s. 

A TV movie was released in 1965 directed by Wilhelm Semmelroth and designed by Franco Zeffirelli, based on the latter&#x27;s previously directed version for stage. It starred Gianni Raimondi in the role of Rodolfo and Mirella Freni as Mimi. The soundtrack, however, was pre-recorded and lip-synced, and conducted by Herbert von Karajan.

Robin Norton-Hale directed a new production at the Cock Tavern Theatre, Kilburn, for OperaUpClose in December 2009. For act 2 the entire audience and cast moved downstairs to the pub itself, with the pub&#x27;s patrons serving as extras in the Cafe Momus scene. In 2010 the production was transferred to the West End&#x27;s Soho Theatre and won a Laurence Olivier Award.

A 2019 production by Canada&#x27;s Against the Grain Theatre featured a translated English libretto, and transposed the story to a contemporary Canadian urban setting. This production toured several Canadian cities before its production at Toronto&#x27;s Tranzac Club was livestreamed by CBC Gem on 13 October. The CBC broadcast received two Canadian Screen Award nominations at the 9th Canadian Screen Awards in 2021, for Best Performing Arts Program and Best Direction in a TV Movie.

<text>Pietro Mascagni (7 December 1863 – 2 August 1945) was an Italian composer primarily known for his operas. His 1890 masterpiece &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; caused one of the greatest sensations in opera history and single-handedly ushered in the &quot;Verismo&quot; movement in Italian dramatic music. While it was often held that Mascagni, like Ruggero Leoncavallo, was a &quot;one-opera man&quot; who could never repeat his first success, &quot;L&#x27;amico Fritz&quot; and &quot;Iris&quot; have remained in the repertoire in Europe (especially Italy) since their premieres.

Mascagni wrote fifteen operas, an operetta, several orchestral and vocal works, and also songs and piano music. He enjoyed immense success during his lifetime, both as a composer and conductor of his own and other people&#x27;s music and created a variety of styles in his operas.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Mascagni was born on 7 December 1863 in Livorno, Tuscany, the second son of Domenico and Emilia Mascagni. His father owned and operated a bakery. Giovanni Targioni-Tozzetti (&quot;Nanni&quot;) was born the same year in the same city and became Mascagni&#x27;s lifelong friend and collaborator.

In 1876, at the age of 13, Mascagni began musical studies with Alfredo Soffredini, who founded the &quot;Instituto Musicale di Livorno&quot; (later called &quot;Istituto Cherubini&quot;). Soffredini had just completed his musical studies in Milan. Also a native of Livorno, Soffredini was a composer, teacher and musical critic. Mascagni started composing rapidly: between 1879 and 1880, he wrote several works: &quot;Sinfonia in do minore&quot;, &quot;Prima sinfonia in fa maggiore&quot;, &quot;Elegia&quot;, &quot;Kyrie&quot;, &quot;Gloria&quot; and &quot;Ave Maria&quot;.

===Musical career: 1880–1889===
The premiere of Mascagni&#x27;s first cantata, &quot;In Filanda&quot;, took place at the Istituto Cherubini on 9 February 1881. Performed at a musical contest in Milan, the cantata won the first prize. In the same year, Mascagni met the musicians Arrigo Boito and Amilcare Ponchielli in Milan.

In 1882, he composed his &quot;Cantata alla gioia&quot; from a text by Friedrich Schiller, followed by &quot;La stella di Garibaldi&quot; for voice and piano, and &quot;La tua stella&quot;. On 6 May Mascagni left Livorno for Milan. He passed the admission examination of the Milan Conservatory on 12 October. In Milan, Mascagni met the noted composer Giacomo Puccini, and was a student of Amintore Galli, artistic director of the .

On 9 January 1883, Mascagni&#x27;s sister, Maria, died. The cantata &quot;In Filanda&quot; became &quot;Pinotta&quot;, and was proposed for the musical contest of the Conservatorio, but as his registration was late, it was not accepted.

In 1884, he composed &quot;Ballata&quot; for tenor and piano; &quot;M&#x27;ama non m&#x27;ama&quot;, scherzo for soprano and piano; &quot;Messagio d&#x27;amore&quot;, and &quot;Alla luna&quot;.

In 1885, Mascagni composed &quot;Il Re a Napoli in Cremona&quot;, a romance for tenor and orchestra, on a text by Andrea Maffei. He left Milan without completing his studies. That year, he began touring as a conductor in the operetta companies of Vittorio Forlì, Alfonso and Ciro Scognamiglio, and, in Genoa, the company of Luigi Arnaldo Vassallo.

Mascagni met the impresario Luigi Maresca in 1886 and started working with him. That December, Mascagni arrived in Cerignola with Maresca&#x27;s company. He was accompanied by Argenide Marcellina Carbognani (Lina), his future wife. Helped by the mayor Giuseppe Cannone, Mascagni soon left the company of Maresca, though not without problems.

He was appointed as the master of music and singing of the new philharmonia of Cerignola. His reputation grew. He also gave piano lessons. In February 1888, he began work on the &quot;Messa di Gloria.&quot; In July 1888, Casa Musicale Sonzogno announced in the &quot;Teatro Illustrato&quot; its second competition for a one-act opera, to be judged by a panel including Galli and Antonio Ghislanzoni. The following year, Mascagni completed his composition of &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; on 27 May and sent the manuscript to Milan. Mascagni won against seventy-two other operas, including Niccola Spinelli&#x27;s &quot;Labilia&quot; and &#x27;s &quot;Rudello&quot;.

Mascagni married Lina Carbognani on 3 February 1889. The next day their first son, Domenico Mascagni (&quot;Mimì&quot;), was born. Their son Dino was born on 3 January 1891. A daughter, Emi, was born in 1892.

===1890–1899===

On 21 February 1890, Mascagni was summoned to Rome to present his opera. The première of &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;, winner of the Sonzogno contest, was held 17 May at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome. It had outstanding success, and the opera was soon performed in both the north and south of Italy: Florence, Turin, Bologna, Palermo, Milan, Genoa, Naples, Venice and Trieste.

In December, Gustav Mahler conducted the opera in Budapest. Soon thereafter, the cities of Munich, Hamburg, St. Petersburg, Dresden and Buenos Aires welcomed the opera. In March 1891, it was sung in Vienna. At age 26, Mascagni had become internationally famous.

Mascagni premiered his &quot;L&#x27;amico Fritz&quot;, his second most successful opera, on 31 October 1891 at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome. &quot;I Rantzau&quot; premiered on 10 November at the Teatro La Pergola, in Florence, under his personal direction.

The composer next completed &quot;Silvano &quot; (1894). On 16 February 1895, he premiered &quot;Guglielmo Ratcliff&quot; at the Teatro alla Scala of Milan. On 15 March &quot;Silvano&quot; was premiered at the same theatre. That year, Mascagni accepted the directorship of the Liceo Rossini in Pesaro and moved his family there.

On 2 March 1896, Mascagni conducted the première of &quot;Zanetto&quot; at the Liceo. He continued his composing and directing. On 29 June 1898 in Recanati, Mascagni conducted the première of his symphonic poem, &quot;A Giacomo Leopardi&quot;. Mascagni began a collaboration with Luigi Illica, a librettist. Their first work, &quot;Iris,&quot; was premiered on 22 November at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome.

Mascagni&#x27;s father died in May 1899.

===1900–1909===

In 1900, Mascagni toured Moscow and St. Petersburg and, on 17 January 1901, &quot;Le maschere&quot; was premiered in six Italian theatres. Giuseppe Verdi died on 27 January and the following month Mascagni commemorated Verdi&#x27;s passing. That same year, he conducted Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; in Vienna.

Mascagni composed the incidental music for Hall Caine&#x27;s play, &quot;The Eternal City&quot; in August 1902; the première of the play with Mascagni&#x27;s music took place in London on 2 October.

In 1902 and 1903, he toured in Canada and the United States, (in particular Montreal, New York City, Philadelphia, Boston and San Francisco), where he conducted many of his and other composers&#x27; works. The tour was mostly a fiasco, except for the visit to San Francisco where Mascagni was extremely well received.

In 1903, Mascagni left Pesaro after problems with the authorities. He became director of the &quot;Scuola Musicale Romana&quot;, in Rome. In the same year, he signed a contract with the French editor Paul de Choudens.

&quot;Amica&quot;, based on a poem by Choudens with a French libretto by Paul Collin, was premiered on 16 March 1905, in Monte-Carlo. That year, he had disputes with Ruggero Leoncavallo and Giacomo Puccini. He also had the Livornese première of &quot;Le maschere&quot;.

Mascagni was director of the Costanzi for the season beginning in August 1909.

===1910–1919===

On 4 April 1910, Mascagni began a relationship with Anna Lolli. In October he was reconciled with Puccini.

Mascagni ceased his activity as director of the Scuola Musicale Romana in 1911. That May he left for Buenos Aires, beginning a seven-month tour in South America. The première of &quot;Isabeau&quot; took place in Buenos Aires on 2 June.

The Italian première of &quot;Isabeau&quot; was held simultaneously at La Scala in Milan (conductor Tullio Serafin) and at La Fenice in Venice (conductor Mascagni) in 1912. On 28 March, he began to work on &quot;Parisina&quot; in Bellevue, near Paris, sometimes with his daughter Emi, his mistress Anna Lolli, and the librettist Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio.

&quot;Parisina&quot; was premiered in Milan on 15 December of that year. Almost all the important Italian composers of the time were present, among them Puccini, Umberto Giordano and Riccardo Zandonai. The new work was premiered in Livorno and Rome in 1914. On 28 July, the events occurred that shortly led to World War I: Puccini and Mascagni were against the involvement of Italy in this war, in which Mascagni&#x27;s son Dino was later made a prisoner.

In 1915 Mascagni wrote music for Nino Oxilia&#x27;s movie &quot;Rapsodia Satanica&quot;; the custom was for silent films to be accompanied live in a theatre by organ, piano, or an orchestra, often using a prepared score (sometimes with original music) with cues for the conductor or musician. Mascagni had a quarrel regarding the rights of Louise de la Ramée&#x27;s &quot;Two Little Wooden Shoes &quot;(&quot;I due Zoccoletti&quot;), which inspired both Puccini and Mascagni. The subject was retained by Mascagni for &quot;Lodoletta&quot;. The latter opera was premiered on 30 April 1917 in Rome. The Livornese première of the opera was on 28 July with Beniamino Gigli as Flammen.

&quot;Sì&quot;, Mascagni&#x27;s operetta, which he had been manoeuvred into writing by the impresario Carlo Lombardo, was premiered on 13 December in Rome.

===1920–1939===
In 1920 Mascagni composed &quot;Il piccolo Marat&quot;, which was premiered in Rome on 2 May 1921, followed by a premiere in Buenos Aires in September. The composer returned to South America for a tour beginning in May 1922.

In 1923, he composed &quot;Visione Lirica&quot;. Mascagni appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; on 6 September 1926.

He moved to the Grand Hotel Plaza in Rome in 1927, a place he would not leave until his death.

In 1930, Mascagni conducted &quot;La bohème&quot; in Torre del Lago, as a homage to Puccini, who had died in 1924. In 1931, &quot;Le maschere&quot; was performed at La Scala.

&quot;Pinotta&quot; was premiered in San Remo on 23 March 1932. He joined the PNF (Fascist party), following the example of many contemporary musicians, including Giordano.

&quot;Nerone&quot; was premièred in Milan on 16 January 1935, followed by the première in Livorno on 24 August.

In June 1936, Mascagni&#x27;s son Dino died in Somalia.

===Last years===

In 1940, celebrations for the fiftieth anniversary of his most popular opera, &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;, took place all over Italy, often with Mascagni conducting. The opera was recorded for &quot;La Voce del padrone&quot; (&quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot;) at La Scala under the direction of Mascagni, who recorded a special spoken introduction. EMI later reissued the recording on LP and CD.

In 1942, after an audience with Pope Pius XII, newspapers quoted Mascagni, a Roman Catholic, as saying that his tuberculosis-stricken niece was cured after receiving a rosary and silver medal blessed by the pope.

In April 1943, Mascagni appeared for the last time at La Scala to conduct &quot;L&#x27;amico Fritz&quot;. By that time he had to conduct sitting on a chair. The last season of Mascagni at the Rome Opera (&quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;amico Fritz&quot;) was 1944–45.

Mascagni died on 2 August 1945 in his apartment at the Grand Hotel Plaza in Rome. The funeral ceremony was on 4 August. The Italian authorities were not present. In 1951, his body was transferred from Rome to Livorno, where Mascagni finally received an official homage. On 7 December 1963, the centenary of Mascagni&#x27;s birth, a plaque was erected in Rome on the Albergo del Sole where Mascagni stayed during the premiere of &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;.

=== Projects contemplated ===
During his long career, Mascagni contemplated writing many operas. The following is an incomplete list of such projects, which never saw the light of day:

* &quot;Zilia&quot;, probably on a libretto by Felice Romani (c. 1877)
* &quot;Scampolo&quot;, probably on a libretto by Dario Niccodemi (c. 1921)
* &quot;I Bianchi ed i Neri&quot;, on a libretto by Mario Ghisalberti (c. 1938)

==In other media==
The soundtrack of the 1980 film &quot;Raging Bull&quot; uses the &quot;Intermezzo&quot; from &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;, the Barcarolle from &quot;Silvano&quot;, and the Intermezzo from &quot;Guglielmo Ratcliff&quot; (known as &quot;Il sogno di Ratcliff&quot;).

The 1990 film &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; used a production of &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; at the Teatro Massimo in Palermo as the setting for its climax, with Michael Corleone&#x27;s son Anthony as Turiddu. The movie ends with the Intermezzo playing.

<text>Giuseppe Saverio Raffaele Mercadante (baptised 17 September 179517 December 1870) was an Italian composer, particularly of operas. While Mercadante may not have retained the international celebrity of Vincenzo Bellini, Gaetano Donizetti or Gioachino Rossini beyond his own lifetime, he composed as prolifically as either and his development of operatic structures, melodic styles and orchestration contributed significantly to the foundations upon which Giuseppe Verdi built his dramatic technique.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Mercadante was born illegitimate in Altamura, near Bari in Apulia; his precise date of birth has not been recorded, but he was baptised on 17 September 1795. Mercadante studied flute, violin and composition at the conservatory in Naples, and organized concerts among his compatriots. The opera composer Gioachino Rossini said to the conservatory Director, Niccolo Zingarelli, &quot;My compliments, Maestro – your young pupil Mercadante begins where we finish&quot;. In 1817 he was made conductor of the college orchestra, composing a number of symphonies, and concertos for various instruments – including six for flute about 1818–1819, and whose autograph scores are in the Naples conservatory, where they were presumably first performed with him as soloist.
The encouragement of Rossini led him to compose for the opera, where he won considerable success with his second such work (&quot;Violenza e Constanza&quot;), in 1820. His next three operas are more or less forgotten, but an abridged recording of &quot;Maria Stuarda, Regina di Scozia&quot; was issued by Opera Rara in 2006. His next opera &quot;Elisa e Claudio&quot; was a huge success, and had occasional revivals in the 20th century, most recently by Wexford Festival Opera in 1988.
He worked for a time in Vienna, in Madrid, in Cádiz, and in Lisbon, but re-established himself in Italy in 1831. He was invited by Rossini to Paris in 1836, where he composed &quot;I Briganti&quot; for four of the best-known singers of the time, Giulia Grisi, Giovanni Battista Rubini, Antonio Tamburini and Luigi Lablache, all of whom worked closely with Bellini. While there, he had the opportunity to hear operas by Meyerbeer and Halévy, which imparted a strong influence on him, especially the latter&#x27;s &quot;La Juive&quot;. This influence took the form of greater stress on the dramatic side.

===Return to Italy, 1831===
When Mercadante returned to Italy after living in Spain and Portugal, Donizetti&#x27;s music reigned supreme in Naples, an ascendancy which did not end until censorship problems with the latter&#x27;s &quot;Poliuto&quot; caused a final break. But Mercadante&#x27;s style began to shift with the presentation of &quot;I Normanni a Parigi&quot; at the Teatro Regio in Turin in 1832: &quot;It was with this score that Mercadante entered on the process of development in his musical dramaturgy which, in some aspects, actually presaged the arrival of Verdi, when he launched, from 1837 on, into master works of his artistic maturity: the so-called &quot;reform operas&quot;.

The beginnings of the so-called &quot;reform movement&quot;, of which Mercadante was part, arose from the publication of a manifesto by Giuseppe Mazzini which he wrote in 1836, the &quot;Filosofia della musica&quot;.

In the period after 1831 he composed some of his most important works. These included &quot;Il giuramento&quot; which was premiered at La Scala to 11 march 1837. One striking and innovative characteristic of this opera has been noted:
..it marks the first successful attempt in an Italian opera premiered in Italy of depriving the prima donna, or some other star singer, of her until-then inalienable right of having the stage to herself at the end. By doing this, Mercadante sounded what was to be the death knell of the age of bel canto.

Early in following year, while composing &quot;Elena da Feltre&quot; (which premiered in January 1839), Mercadante wrote to Francesco Florimo, laying out his ideas about how opera should be structured, following the &quot;revolution&quot; begun in his previous opera:
I have continued the revolution I began in &quot;Il giuramento&quot;: varied forms, cabalettas banished, crescendos out, vocal lines simplified, fewer repeats, more originality in the cadences, proper regard paid to the drama, orchestration rich but not so as to swamp the voices, no long solos in the ensembles (they only force the other parts to stand idle to the detriment of the action), not much bass drum, and a lot less brass band.

&quot;Elena da Feltre&quot; followed; one critic found much to praise in it:
These temporarily put him in the forefront of composers then active in Italy, although he was soon passed by Giovanni Pacini with &quot;Saffo&quot; and Giuseppe Verdi with several operas, especially &quot;Ernani&quot;.

===Later works===

Some of Mercadante&#x27;s later works, especially &quot;Orazi e Curiazi&quot;, were also quite successful. Many performances of his operas were given throughout the 19th century and it has been noted that some of them received far more than those of Verdi&#x27;s early operas over the same period of time.

Throughout his life he generated more instrumental works than most of his contemporary composers of operas due to his lifelong preoccupation with orchestration, and, from 1840, his position as the Director of the Naples conservatory for the last thirty years of his life. From 1863 he was almost totally blind and dictated all his compositions.

In the decades after his death in Naples in 1870, his output was largely forgotten, but it has been occasionally revived and recorded since World War II, although it has yet to achieve anything like the present-day popularity of the most famous compositions by his slightly younger contemporaries: see Donizetti&#x27;s compositions and Bellini&#x27;s compositions.

The French soloist Jean-Pierre Rampal notably recorded several Mercadante concertos for flute and string orchestra, including the grand and romantic E minor concerto, which has since gained some popularity among concert flautists.

<doc id="37933" wikidata="Q862351" url="?curid=37933" title="Maison Ikkoku">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Rumiko Takahashi. It was serialized in Shogakukan&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Big Comic Spirits&quot; from November 1980 to April 1987, with the chapters collected into 15 volumes. &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; is a romantic comedy involving a group of eccentric people who live in a boarding house in 1980s Tokyo. The story focuses primarily on the gradually developing relationships between Yusaku Godai, a poor student down on his luck, and Kyoko Otonashi, a young, recently widowed boarding house manager.

The manga was adapted into a ninety-six-episode anime television series created by Studio Deen that ran on Fuji TV from March 1986 to March 1988. A &quot;Final Chapter&quot; movie, three original video animations (OVAs), and a music special were also produced, with a live-action film made by Toei in 1986. A live-action TV special aired in May 2007 on TV Asahi, with a finale aired in July 2008. Both the manga and anime have been released in North America by Viz Media.

&quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; has been both critically and commercially successful, with over 25 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series.

==Plot==

The story mainly takes place at , a worn and aging boarding house in a fictional Tokyo ward called , where 20-year-old college applicant Yusaku Godai lives. Though honest and good-natured, he is weak-willed and often taken advantage of by the other residents of Maison Ikkoku, each with their offbeat and mischievous personalities: Yotsuya the voyeur, shameless Akemi Roppongi and the Ichinose family, primarily stay-at-home mom Hanae Ichinose. As he is about to move out, he is stopped at the door by the beautiful Kyoko Otonashi (née Chigusa), who announces she will be taking over as the resident manager. Godai immediately falls in love with her and decides to stay. Godai and the other tenants find out that despite her young age, Kyoko is a widow: after she married her high school teacher Soichiro, he tragically died shortly thereafter. Godai empathizes with Kyoko and endeavors to free her from her sadness. He manages to work up enough courage to confess his love to her, and just as their nascent relationship begins to develop, Kyoko meets the rich, handsome and charming tennis coach Shun Mitaka at her neighborhood tennis club. Mitaka quickly declares his intention to court Kyoko and states that he is very patient, and can wait until her heart is ready.

Godai, not willing to give up, continues to chase Kyoko, but through a series of misunderstandings, he is seen by Kyoko and Mitaka walking with the cute and innocent Kozue Nanao, who he had met previously at one of his many part-time jobs. For the rest of the series, Kozue is mistakenly perceived as Godai&#x27;s girlfriend, including by Kozue herself. Angered by this, Kyoko begins to openly date Mitaka. Despite the misunderstandings, Kyoko and Godai clearly have feelings for each other, and their relationship continues to grow over the course of the series. Godai eventually manages to get into college and, with the help of the Otonashi family, he begins student-teaching at Kyoko&#x27;s old high school. Almost mirroring Kyoko&#x27;s first romance, Godai catches the attention of precocious and brazen student Ibuki Yagami, who immediately begins pursuing him. Her outspoken approach stands in stark contrast to Kyoko, which helps Kyoko face her feelings for Godai.

Meanwhile, Mitaka&#x27;s endeavors have been hindered by his phobia of dogs, as Kyoko owns a large white dog named Soichiro in honor of her late husband. He eventually overcomes his phobia but, when he is about to propose to Kyoko, his family begins to goad him into an arranged marriage with the pure and innocent heiress Asuna Kujo. Feeling the pressure, Mitaka begins to pursue Kyoko with increased aggression. He slowly realizes that she has decided on Godai and is waiting for him to find a job and propose. Mitaka is completely pulled out of the race following a drunken night, after which he misremembers sleeping with Asuna. When she later announces a pregnancy, he takes responsibility and proposes to Asuna, but finds out too late that it was her dog who was pregnant and not her; however he fully realizes that he has loved her since their first meeting and promises to never make her feel second-best in their marriage.

As things begin to really go well for Godai, Kozue Nanao makes a reappearance in his life. Kozue tells Godai and the other Maison Ikkoku tenants that she is thinking of marrying another man, and when Godai said he is planning his own proposal, Kozue misunderstands and believes he intends to propose to her. Kyoko, feeling foolish and betrayed, slaps Godai and demands that he move out. When Godai refuses, he wakes up the next morning to find she has left, moving in with her parents and leaving her room empty. Godai tries to explain himself by visiting Kyoko every day, but she refuses to answer the door or grant him an audience. After her rage cools, Kyoko checks on Maison Ikkoku and runs into the other tenants. They try to convince her to return.
The libertine Akemi, sensing that Kyoko is still hesitant, threatens to seduce Godai if Kyoko does not want him. She later tells the other tenants that she only said that to threaten Kyoko into coming back. However, this backfires when Kozue sees Godai leaving a love hotel with Akemi; innocently, he was called there only to cover the room fees. Before she learns the truth, Kozue accepts the marriage proposal from the other man. As Kyoko is about to return to Maison Ikkoku, she learns about the love hotel incident that has ended Godai&#x27;s relationship with Kozue, but assumes he slept with Akemi. Kyoko insults Godai, tells him that she hates him, and runs away. Godai follows her, pleading that she does not trust him and that, despite the many misunderstandings he has had with other women, she never considered Godai&#x27;s feelings. He passionately declares that he loves only her: from the first moment he saw Kyoko, she has been the only woman in his eyes. Kyoko finally decides to no longer hold back her feelings for Godai and the two consummate their love; the following morning, she happily confesses that she has been in love with him for the longest time. Having cleared his last barrier after securing a teaching job, Godai proposes to Kyoko and, with the blessings of both families, they get married. The story ends as Godai and Kyoko arrive home with their newborn daughter, Haruka, and Kyoko tells her that Maison Ikkoku is the place where they first met.

==Production==
Takahashi created &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; as a love story that could occur in the real world. She originally only wanted to start the series focusing on Kyoko and Godai&#x27;s relationship before moving on to include the other tenants to have a &quot;human drama,&quot; but said the love story attracted her more and took over. She had wanted to create a story about an apartment complex for some time, as when she lived in an apartment in Nagano during college, there was another decrepit apartment behind it. The strange actions of the people living there served as inspiration.

It was &quot;Big Comic Spirits&quot;″s editor-in-chief Katsuya Shirai who recruited Takahashi for the newly-launching manga magazine. Soichiro Suzuki, Takahashi&#x27;s third editor on &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; beginning from the eighth or ninth chapter, explained that having a young up-and-coming female artist attracted much attention for the new magazine. Suzuki also said that Takahashi went with the romantic comedy genre for the new series because of the magazine&#x27;s older reader demographic, but noted it still had the gag-like feel of &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; in the beginning. According to both Shirai and Suzuki, &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; was popular right from the start.

Takahashi created &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; simultaneously alongside the weekly &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot;. The newer manga&#x27;s frequency changed as &quot;Big Comic Spirits&quot; did; it began as a monthly magazine, switched to bimonthly after six months, and became a weekly publication in 1986. In an interview during its serialization, Takahashi stated she usually took two days to create the story and draw rough drafts, and then took one night to finish them. At the time she had three female assistants, refusing to have males so that they would not be distracted. According to Suzuki, this increased to five assistants when it became a weekly serial. The series&#x27; title utilizes the French word (&quot;house&quot;) and translates to &quot;The House of One-Moment&quot;. The story occurs over a six-year period, approximate to the publication period of the series.

==Media==
===Manga===

Written and illustrated by Rumiko Takahashi, &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; was serialized in the manga magazine &quot;Big Comic Spirits&quot; as 162 chapters between November 15, 1980, and April 20, 1987. The chapters were collected and published into 15 volumes by Shogakukan from May 1, 1982, to July 1, 1987. The series has since been re-released in several different editions. A 10 volume edition was released between September 1, 1992, and June 1, 1993, 10 from 1996 to 1997, and 15 throughout 2007.

North American publisher Viz Media originally released the series, adapted into English by Gerard Jones, in a monthly comic book format from June 1993. This release was collected into 14 graphic novels. The images were &quot;flipped&quot; to read left-to-right, causing the art to be mirrored, and some chapters were out of order or completely missing. Four of the five missing chapters were published in &quot;Animerica Extra&quot; Vol. 3 Number 1 and Vol. 3 Number 2. Viz later re-released the series in its original format and chapter order across 15 volumes. These were released between September 24, 2003, and February 14, 2006. At New York Comic Con 2019, Viz announced that they would release &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; in a collector&#x27;s edition, with the first volume released on September 15, 2020, and the tenth and last on December 27, 2022.

===Radio drama===
A radio drama was broadcast on November 20, 1982, on NHK Radio 1 as part of an episode of the &quot;Radio Comics&quot; program. The segment was hosted by Yū Mizushima and Keiko Yokozawa, and featured manga artist Jun Ishiko as a guest. It also included an interview with Rumiko Takahashi by Mizushima. The music for the episode was composed by Ichirou Mizuki. It featured Mari Okamoto as Kyoko, Kazuhiko Inoue as Godai, Midori Katō as Hanae Ichinose, Yusaku Yara as Yotsuya, Eiko Hisamura as Akemi, and was narrated by Junpei Takiguchi.

===Anime===

&quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; was adapted into a ninety-six episode anime television series by Studio Deen and aired on Fuji TV from March 26, 1986, to March 2, 1988. The series was directed by Kazuo Yamazaki for the first 26 episodes, Takashi Anno from episode 27 until 52 and Naoyuki Yoshinaga for the remainder of the series. The production staff had previously worked on the anime adaption of Takahashi&#x27;s previous work, &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot;. After production of that series was completed, the team moved straight onto &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; and the series took over &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot;&#x27;s timeslot. A new HD remaster of the series has been created and released on two Blu-ray boxsets in Japan. The first box was released on December 25, 2013, and the second box followed on April 23, 2014.

An animated theatrical film titled &quot;The Final Chapter&quot; was released on February 6, 1988, as a double feature with &quot;Urusei Yatsura Movie 5: The Final Chapter&quot;. On September 25, 1988, an original video animation &quot;Through the Passing Seasons&quot; that summarizes the story was released. A video titled &quot;Karaoke Music Parade&quot; and collecting all the TV anime&#x27;s opening and ending animations was released in November 1989. &quot;Shipwrecked on Ikkoku Island&quot; was released on January 31, 1991, and adapts a story of the manga, while &quot;Prelude Maison Ikkoku: When the Cherry Blossoms Return in the Spring&quot; utilizes all the flashbacks of Kyoko&#x27;s life before she moved to Maison Ikkoku and was released on June 25, 1992.

The anime was licensed for a North American release by Viz Media in 1994, and was put on two-episode VHS dub releases, but Viz dropped the English dub after 36 episodes. The remaining subtitled-only VHS releases went on until volume 32, without finishing the series. Viz released the series as 8 DVD boxsets from June 1, 2003, until June 4, 2006, with the latter episodes newly dubbed. In the newer episodes, Godai was given a new voice actor, as Jason Gray-Stanford was replaced by Brad Swaile. Other characters such as Kozue and Ikuko were also recast.

===Live-action===
A live-action film adaptation of &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; was released on October 10, 1986, by the Toei Company. Directed by Shinichirō Sawai and written by Yōzō Tanaka, the movie stars Mariko Ishihara as Kyoko Otonashi, Ken Ishiguro as Yusaku Godai and Masatō Ibu as Yotsuya

A live-action TV special premiered on TV Asahi on May 12, 2007. It stars Taiki Nakabayashi as Yusaku and Misaki Ito as Kyoko. A finale to the show was aired on July 26, 2008, under the title &quot;Maison Ikkoku Kanketsuhen&quot; and featuring Akina Minami as Kozue Nanao and Ikki Sawamura as Shun Mitaka.

===Music===

Beginning in 1986, various collections of theme songs, incidental music, character albums, and music calendars were released on LP, cassette, CD, and VHS. Most of the albums were released through Kitty Records. A &quot;Maison Ikkoku Sound Theater&quot; series of 48 discs released the full soundtracks of all 96 episodes as audio dramas. An addition &quot;Sound Theater&quot; release contained audio from the &quot;Side Story: Ikkoku Island Flirtation Story&quot; and &quot;Prelude, When the Cherry Blossoms Return in the Spring&quot; OVAs.

Two box sets, &quot;Maison Ikkoku CD Single Memorial File&quot; and &quot;Maison Ikkoku Complete Music Box&quot;, collected all of the theme songs and incidental music from the animated series.

===Other media===
A couple video games based on &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; have been released, the first being developed by Microcabin, which was originally released in 1986 for the PC-9801 and PC Engine before being ported to the Famicom in 1988 by Bothtec. Microcabin also created in 1988 for the PC-9801 and MSX2. Three pachislot video games were also released in 2006, 2009 and 2012.

The series was featured in the music video &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot; of the American singer-songwriter Norah Jones, released in October 2020. The series was chosen due to the similarities of the female figure of the lyrics of the song to Kyoko Otonashi.

==Reception==
&quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; has over 25 million collected volumes in circulation. In 2002, Christopher Macdonald, co-editor-in-chief of Anime News Network, wrote that while far from her most popular, &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; is considered by many to be Rumiko Takahashi&#x27;s best work. Although all her titles have a romantic angle, he said that with its lack of supernatural elements or aliens, &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot;″s simple premise of a university student who falls in love with his landlady is mundane in comparison, but it is this excellently crafted romantic story that makes it her greatest work. Macdonald wrote that what it does have in common with most of Takahashi&#x27;s other works is &quot;absolute, unadulterated hilarity,&quot; but this differs still in that it features hilarious situations that actually happen in the real world. Like Macdonald, Comics Beat&#x27;s Morgana Santilli noted how &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; is an anomaly in Takahashi&#x27;s bibliography as it contains no fantasy or magical elements, but does include her signature wacky romcom hijinks of &quot;jealous would-be lovers, plenty of pratfalls, and needlessly complicated misunderstandings,&quot; which makes it just as charming and fun as more popular works like &quot;Ranma ½&quot;.

Jason Thompson claimed that while &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; was not the first men&#x27;s love-com, it is &quot;almost certainly the best&quot; and definitely Takahashi&#x27;s best work. He also stated that because the main character is a university student, &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; is &quot;slightly more sophisticated&quot; compared to &quot;Kimagure Orange Road&quot;. Anime News Network (ANN) gave the manga an &quot;A&quot; for its story and an &quot;A−&quot; for its art, stating that the series shows off Takahashi&#x27;s skill; &quot;with a clear cut and rather simple plot, she is able to concentrate on the characters, using them to drive the story, while at the same time ensuring the proper reader reaction intended for each scene.&quot; They remarked that the story focuses on Yusaku and Kyoko&#x27;s relationship, with the other characters used only &quot;to create conflicts, exposition, and comedic relief.&quot;

Commenting on the 2020 English release of the manga, Daryl Surat of &quot;Otaku USA&quot; wrote &quot;After decades of &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; derivatives, the original hit manga remains as delightful as it was back in the 1980s.&quot; He also noted that unlike &quot;every other will-they-won&#x27;t-they Rumiko Takahashi romantic comedy,&quot; this one actually has an ending. Caitlin Moore of ANN called &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; &quot;timeless and universal&quot; and the most grounded and straightforward romance in Takahashi&#x27;s oeuvre, where, although it is clear from the start who the main couple is and that they will fall in love by the end, it is not clear how that will happen. With Kyoko a widow, she called the manga one of the best portrayals of the slow and messy nature of the grieving process. Although she noted the art as dated, Moore felt it still holds up well with its simple but expressive designs, and that the suburban Tokyo setting gives a timeless feeling. Calling Viz&#x27;s older translation &quot;punchy, but not super faithful,&quot; she called the new one a good balance between faithful to the Japanese and natural-reading English. Moore finished her review with &quot;I have long considered &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; one of the greatest love stories of all time, but it&#x27;s so much more than that. It&#x27;s a romance, a comedy, a coming-of-age story, a story of loss and recovery.&quot; Right Stuf Inc. called &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; a classic rom-com that has many of the strengths of modern sitcoms and praised the back-and-forth between characters as always hilarious and the romance between Godai and Kyoko as both nuanced and sweet. They described the art as giving the characters &quot;a comedic whimsy,&quot; and opined that &quot;good art is never dated, because good art is timeless.&quot;

ANN&#x27;s Allen Divers wrote positive reviews of the anime, saying &quot;The beauty of &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; is the fact that the entire cast feels dynamic enough that each could be the center of an episode without pulling away from the main idea of the series.&quot; and called it a must-see for fans of romantic comedies. Melissa Sternenberg of THEM Anime Reviews gave the show a perfect five star rating, calling the development between the two main characters refreshing and praising the supporting cast for reacting to what happens around them. Although she did point out the music and sound effects might seem dated. She finished saying &quot;There may never be &#x27;the greatest anime series of all time,&#x27; but I would bet a good amount of money that this series would be on most (respected) anime viewers&#x27; top five lists.&quot; TV Asahi released two Top 100 Anime lists in 2005; &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; came in 80 on the nationwide survey of multiple age-groups, and 89 on the web poll. A 2019 NHK poll of 210,061 people saw &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; named Takahashi&#x27;s third best animated work.

<doc id="37934" wikidata="Q101698" url="?curid=37934" title="Gaetano Donizetti">
<text>Domenico Gaetano Maria Donizetti (29 November 1797 – 8 April 1848) was an Italian Romantic composer, best known for his almost 70 operas. Along with Gioachino Rossini and Vincenzo Bellini, he was a leading composer of the &quot;bel canto&quot; opera style during the first half of the nineteenth century and a probable influence on other composers such as Giuseppe Verdi. Donizetti was born in Bergamo in Lombardy. At an early age he was taken up by Simon Mayr who enrolled him with a full scholarship in a school which he had set up. There he received detailed musical training. Mayr was instrumental in obtaining a place for Donizetti at the Bologna Academy, where, at the age of 19, he wrote his first one-act opera, the comedy &quot;Il Pigmalione&quot;, which may never have been performed during his lifetime.

An offer in 1822 from Domenico Barbaja, the impresario of the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples, which followed the composer&#x27;s ninth opera, led to his move to Naples and his residency there until production of &quot;Caterina Cornaro&quot; in January 1844. In all, 51 of Donizetti&#x27;s operas were presented in Naples. Before 1830, success came primarily with his comic operas, the serious ones failing to attract significant audiences. His first notable success came with an &quot;opera seria&quot;, &quot;Zoraida di Granata&quot;, which was presented in 1822 in Rome. In 1830, when &quot;Anna Bolena&quot; was first performed, Donizetti made a major impact on the Italian and international opera scene shifting the balance of success away from primarily comedic operas, although even after that date, his best-known works included comedies such as &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot; (1832) and &quot;Don Pasquale&quot; (1843). Significant historical dramas did succeed; they included &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; (the first to have a libretto written by Salvadore Cammarano) given in Naples in 1835, and one of the most successful Neapolitan operas, &quot;Roberto Devereux&quot; in 1837. Up to that point, all of his operas had been set to Italian libretti.

Donizetti found himself increasingly chafing against the censorship limitations in Italy (and especially in Naples). From about 1836, he became interested in working in Paris, where he saw greater freedom to choose subject matter, in addition to receiving larger fees and greater prestige. From 1838, beginning with an offer from the Paris Opéra for two new works, he spent much of the following 10 years in that city, and set several operas to French texts as well as overseeing staging of his Italian works. The first opera was a French version of the then-unperformed &quot;Poliuto&quot; which, in April 1840, was revised to become &quot;Les martyrs&quot;. Two new operas were also given in Paris at that time. Throughout the 1840s Donizetti moved between Naples, Rome, Paris, and Vienna, continuing to compose and stage his own operas as well as those of other composers. From around 1843, severe illness began to limit his activities. By early 1846 he was obliged to be confined to an institution for the mentally ill and, by late 1847, friends had him moved back to Bergamo, where he died in April 1848 in a state of mental derangement due to neurosyphilis.

==Early life and musical education in Bergamo and Bologna==

The youngest of three sons, Donizetti was born in 1797 in the Borgo Canale quarter of Bergamo, located just outside the city walls. His family was very poor and had no tradition of music, his father Andrea being the caretaker of the town pawnshop. Simone Mayr, a German composer of internationally successful operas, had become &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at Bergamo&#x27;s principal church in 1802. He founded the Lezioni Caritatevoli school in Bergamo (now the Conservatorio Gaetano Donizetti) in 1805 for the purpose of providing musical training, including classes in literature, beyond what choirboys ordinarily received up until the time that their voices broke. In 1807, Andrea Donizetti attempted to enroll both his sons, but the elder, Giuseppe (then 18), was considered too old. Gaetano (then 9) was accepted.
While not especially successful as a choirboy during the first three trial months of 1807 (there being some concern about a &quot;difetto di gola&quot;, a throat defect), Mayr was soon reporting that Gaetano &quot;surpasses all the others in musical progress&quot; and he was able to persuade the authorities that the young boy&#x27;s talents were worthy of keeping him in the school. He remained there for nine years, until 1815.

However, as Donizetti scholar William Ashbrook notes, in 1809 he was threatened with having to leave because his voice was changing. In 1810 he applied for and was accepted by the local art school, the Academia Carrara, but it is not known whether he attended classes. Then, in 1811, Mayr once again intervened. Having written both libretto and music for a &quot;pasticcio-farsa&quot;, &quot;Il piccolo compositore di musica&quot;, as the final concert of the academic year, Mayr cast five young students, among them his young pupil Donizetti as &quot;the little composer&quot;. As Ashbrook states, this &quot;was nothing less than Mayr&#x27;s argument that Donizetti be allowed to continue his musical studies&quot;.

The piece was performed on 13 September 1811 and included the composer character stating the following:

In reply to the chiding which comes from the other four characters in the piece after the &quot;little composer&quot; &#x27;s boasts, in the drama the &quot;composer&quot; responds with:

The performance also included a waltz which Donizetti played and for which he received credit in the libretto. In singing this piece, all five young men were given opportunities to show off their musical knowledge and talent.

The following two years were somewhat precarious for the young Donizetti: the 16-year-old created quite a reputation for what he did do—which is regularly to fail to attend classes—and also for what he did instead, which was to make something of a spectacle of himself in the town.

However, in spite of all this, Mayr not only persuaded Gaetano&#x27;s parents to allow him to continue studies, but also secured funding from the Congregazione di Carità in Bergamo for two years of scholarships. In addition, he provided the young musician with letters of recommendation to both the publisher Giovanni Ricordi as well as to the Marchese Francesco Sampieri in Bologna (who would find him suitable lodging) and where, at the Liceo Musicale, he was given the opportunity to study musical structure under the Padre Stanislao Mattei.

In Bologna, he would justify the faith which Mayr had placed in him. Author John Stewart Allitt describes his 1816 &quot;initial exercises in operatic style&quot;, the opera &quot;Il pigmalione&quot;, as well as his composition of portions of &quot;Olympiade&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;ira d&#x27;Achille&quot; in 1817, as no more than &quot;suggest[ing] the work of a student&quot;. Encouraged by Mayr to return to Bergamo in 1817, he began his &quot;quartet years&quot; as well as composing piano pieces and, most likely, being a performing member of quartets where he would have also heard music of other composers. In addition, he began seeking employment.

==Career as an opera composer==

===1818–1822: early compositions===
After extending his time in Bologna for as long as he could, Donizetti was forced to return to Bergamo since no other prospects appeared. Various small opportunities came his way and, at the same time, he made the acquaintance of several of the singers appearing during the 1817/18 Carnival season. Among them was the soprano Giuseppina Ronzi de Begnis and her husband, the bass Giuseppe de Begnis.


A coincidental meeting around April 1818 with an old school friend, Bartolomeo Merelli (who was to go on to a distinguished career), led to an offer to compose the music from a libretto which became &quot;Enrico di Borgogna&quot;. Without a commission from any opera house, Donizetti decided to write the music first and then try to find a company to accept it. He was able to do so when Paolo Zancla, the impresario of the Teatro San Luca (an early theatre built in 1629, which later became the Teatro Goldoni) in Venice accepted it. Thus &quot;Enrico&quot; was presented on 14 November 1818, but with little success, the audience appearing to be more interested in the newly re-decorated opera house rather than the performances, which suffered from the last-minute withdrawal of the soprano Adelaide Catalani due to stage fright and the consequent omission of some her music. Musicologist and Donizetti scholar William Ashbrook provides a quotation from a review in the &quot;Nuovo osservatore veneziano&quot; of 17 November in which the reviewer notes some of these performance issues which faced the composer, but he adds: &quot;one cannot but recognize a regular handling and expressive quality in his style. For these the public wanted to salute Signor Donizetti on stage at the end of the opera.&quot;

For Donizetti, the result was a further commission and, using another of Merelli&#x27;s librettos, this became the one-act, &quot;Una follia&quot; which was presented a month later. However, with no other work forthcoming, the composer once again returned to Bergamo, where a cast of singers made up from the Venice production the month before, presented &quot;Enrico di Borgogna&quot; in his home town on 26 December. He spent the early months of 1819 working on some sacred and instrumental music, but little else came of his efforts until the latter part of the year when he wrote &quot;Il falegname di Livonia&quot; from a libretto by Gherardo Bevilacqua-Aldobrandini. The opera was given first at the Teatro San Samuele in Venice in December. Other work included expansion of &quot;Le nozze in villa&quot;, a project which he had started in mid-1819, but the opera was not presented until the carnival season of 1820/21 in Mantua. Little is known about it except its lack of success and the fact that the score has totally disappeared.

===1822–1830: Rome, Naples, Milan===

====Success in Rome====
After these minor compositions under the commission of Paolo Zancla, Donizetti retreated to Bergamo once again to examine how he could make his career move along. From the point of view of Donizetti&#x27;s evolving style, Ashbrook states that, in order to please the opera-going public in the first quarter of the 19th century, it was necessary to cater to their tastes, to make a major impression at the first performance (otherwise there would be no others), and to emulate the preferred musical style of the day, that of Rossini whose music &quot;was the public&#x27;s yardstick when they were assessing new scores&quot;.


Remaining in Bergamo until October 1821, the composer busied himself with a variety of instrumental and choral pieces, but during that year, he had been in negotiation with Giovanni Paterni, intendant of the Teatro Argentina in Rome, and by 17 June had received a contract to compose another opera from a libretto being prepared by Merelli. It is unclear as to how this connection came about: whether it had been at Merelli&#x27;s suggestion or whether, as William Ashbrook speculates, it had been Mayr who had initially been approached by Paterni to write the opera but who, due to advancing age, had recommended his prize pupil. This new &quot;opera seria&quot; became Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Zoraida di Granata&quot;, his ninth work. The libretto had been started by August and, between then and 1 October, when Donizetti was provided with a letter of introduction from Mayr to Jacopo Ferretti, the Roman poet and librettist who was later to feature in the young composer&#x27;s career, much of the music had been composed.

The twenty-four-year-old composer arrived in Rome on 21 October, but plans for staging the opera were plagued with a major problem: the tenor cast in the major role died a few days before the opening night on 28 January 1822 and the role had to be re-written for a &quot;musico&quot;, a mezzo-soprano singing a male role, a not uncommon feature of the era and of Rossini&#x27;s operas. Opening night was a triumph for Donizetti; as reported in the weekly &quot;Notizie del giorno&quot;:

====Donizetti moves to Naples====
Soon after 19 February, Donizetti left Rome for Naples, where he was to settle for a large part of his life. It appears that he had asked Mayr for a letter of introduction, but his fame had preceded him for, on 28th, the announcement of the summer season at the Teatro Nuovo in the &quot;Giornale del Regno delle Due Sicilie&quot; stated that it would include a Donizetti opera, describing the composer as:


News of this work impressed Domenico Barbaja, the prominent intendant of the Teatro San Carlo and other royal houses in the city such as the smaller Teatro Nuovo and the Teatro del Fondo. By late March Donizetti had been offered a contract not only to compose new operas, but also to be responsible for preparing performances of new productions by other composers whose work had been given elsewhere. On 12 May the first new opera, &quot;La zingara&quot;, was given at the Nuovo &quot;with hot enthusiasm&quot;, as scholar Herbert Weinstock states.

It ran for 28 consecutive evenings, followed by 20 more in July, receiving high praise in the &quot;Giornale&quot;. One of the later performances became the occasion for Donizetti to meet the then-21-year-old music student, Vincenzo Bellini, an event recounted by Francesco Florimo some sixty years later.

The second new work, which appeared six weeks later on 29 June, was a one-act &quot;farsa&quot;, &quot;La lettera anonima&quot;. Ashbrook&#x27;s comments—which reinforce those of the &quot;Giornali&quot; critic who reviewed the work on 1 July—recognize an important aspect of Donizetti&#x27;s burgeoning musical style: [he shows that] &quot;his concern with the dramatic essence of opera rather than the mechanical working out of musical formulas was, even at this early stage, was already present and active&quot;.

====Late July 1822 to February 1824: assignments in Milan and Rome====
On 3 August for what would become &quot;Chiara e Serafina, ossia I pirati&quot;, Donizetti entered into a contract with librettist Felice Romani, but he was over-committed and unable to deliver anything until 3 October. The premiere had been scheduled for only about three weeks away and, due to the delays and illnesses among the cast members, it did not receive good reviews, although it did receive a respectable 12 performances.

Returning north via Rome, Donizetti signed a contract for performances of &quot;Zoraida&quot; by the Teatro Argentina which included the requirement that the libretto to be revised by Ferretti, given Donizetti&#x27;s low opinion of the work of the original Neapolitan librettist, Andrea Leone Tottola: he referred to it as &quot;a great barking&quot;. In addition to the revision, he committed to write another new opera for the Rome&#x27;s Teatro Valle which would also be set to a libretto written by Ferretti. Donizetti finally returned to Naples by late March.

Immediately busy in the spring months of 1823 with a cantata, an &quot;opera seria&quot; for the San Carlo, and an &quot;opera buffa&quot; for the Nuovo, Donizetti also had to work on the revised &quot;Zoraide&quot; for Rome. Unfortunately however, the music set for the San Carlo premiere of &quot;Alfredo il grande&quot; on 2 July was described in the &quot;Giornali&quot; as &quot;...one could not recognize the composer of &quot;La zingara&quot;&quot;. It received only one performance, while his two-act &quot;farsa&quot;, &quot;Il fortunato inganno&quot;, given in September at the Teatro del Fondo, received only three performances.

In October and for the remainder of the year, he was back in Rome, where he spent time adding five new pieces to &quot;Zoraida&quot;, which was performed at the Teatro Argentina on 7 January 1824. However, this version was less successful than the original. The second opera for Rome&#x27;s Teatro Valle also had a libretto by Ferretti, one which has since been regarded as one of his best. It was the &quot;opera buffa&quot; &quot;L&#x27;ajo nell&#x27;imbarazzo&quot; (&quot;The Tutor Embarrassed&quot;), the premiere of which took place on 4 February 1824 and &quot;was greeted with wild enthusiasm [and] it was with this opera that [...] Donizetti had his first really lasting success&quot;. Allitt notes that with a good libretto to hand, &quot;Donizetti never failed its dramatic content&quot; and he adds that &quot;Donizetti had a far better sense of what would succeed on the stage than his librettists&quot;.

====1824–1830: Palermo and Naples====
Back in Naples, he embarked upon his first venture into English Romanticism with the &quot;opera semiseria&quot;, &quot;Emilia di Liverpool&quot;, which was given only seven performances in July 1824 at the Nuovo. The critical reaction in the &quot;Giornali&quot; some months later focused on the weaknesses of the &quot;semiseria&quot; genre itself, although it did describe Donizetti&#x27;s music for &quot;Emilia&quot; as &quot;pretty&quot;. The composer&#x27;s activities in Naples became limited because 1825 was a Holy Year in Rome and the death of Ferdinand I in Naples caused little or no opera to be produced in either city for a considerable time.

However, he did obtain a year-long position for the 1825/26 season at the Teatro Carolino in Palermo, where he became musical director (as well teaching at the Palermo Conservatory). There, he staged his 1824 version of &quot;L&#x27;ajo nell&#x27;imbarazzo&quot; as well as his new opera &quot;Alahor in Granata&quot;. But overall, his experience in Palermo does not appear to have been pleasant, mainly because of the poorly managed theatre, the continual indisposition of singers, or their failure to appear on time. These issues caused a delay until January 1827 for the premiere of &quot;Alahor&quot;, after which he went back in Naples in February, but with no specific commitments until midsummer.

That summer was to see the successful presentations at the Teatro Nuovo of the adapted version of &quot;L&#x27;ajo nell&#x27;imbarazzo&quot; given as &quot;Don Gregorio&quot; and, a month later, a one-act &quot;melodramma&quot; or opera, &quot;Elvida&quot;, a &quot;pièce d&#x27;occasion&quot; for the birthday of Queen Maria of the Two Sicilies, which contained some florid music for the tenor Giovanni Battista Rubini; but it only received three performances.

Writer John Stewart Allitt observes that, by 1827/28, three important elements in Donizetti&#x27;s professional and personal life came together: Firstly, he met and began to work with the librettist Domenico Gilardoni, who wrote eleven librettos for him, beginning with &quot;Otto mesi in due ore&quot; in 1827 and continuing until 1833. Gilardoni shared with the composer a very good sense of what would work on stage. Next, the Naples impresario Barbaja engaged him to write twelve new operas during the following three years. In addition, he was to be appointed to the position of Director of the Royal Theatres of Naples beginning in 1829, a job that the composer accepted and held until 1838. Like Rossini, who had occupied this position before him, Donizetti was free to compose for other opera houses. Finally, in May 1827 he announced his engagement to Virginia Vasselli, the then 18-year-old daughter of the Roman family who had befriended him there.

The couple were married in July 1828 and immediately settled in a new home in Naples. Within two months he had written another &quot;opera semiseria&quot;, &quot;Gianni di Calais&quot;, from a libretto by Gilardoni. It was their fourth collaboration, and became a success not only in Naples but also in Rome over the 1830/31 season. Writing about the Naples premiere, the correspondent of the &quot;Gazzetta privilegiata di Milano&quot; stated: &quot;The situations that the libretto offers are truly ingenious and do honour to the poet, Gilardoni. Maestro Donizetti has known how to take advantage of them...&quot;, thus reaffirming the growing dramatic skills displayed by the young composer.

===1830–1838: international fame===

In 1830, Donizetti scored his most acclaimed and his first international success with &quot;Anna Bolena&quot;, given at the Teatro Carcano in Milan on 26 December 1830 with Giuditta Pasta in the title role. Also, the acclaimed tenor Giovanni Battista Rubini appeared in the role of Percy. With this opera, Donizetti achieved instant fame throughout Europe. Performances were staged &quot;up and down the Italian peninsula&quot; between 1830 and 1834 and then throughout Europe&#x27;s capitals well into the 1840s, with revivals being presented up to about 1881. London was the first European capital to see the work; it was given at the King&#x27;s Theatre on 8 July 1831.

In regard to which operatic form Donizetti was to have the greater success, when the semi-seria work of 1828, &quot;Gianni di Calais&quot;, was given in Rome very soon after &quot;Anna Bolena&quot; had appeared, the &quot;Gazzetta privilegiata di Milano&quot; described the relationship between the two forms of opera and concluded that &quot;in two classes—tragic and comic—very close together...the former wins incomparably over the latter&quot;. This appears to have solidified Donizetti&#x27;s reputation as a composer of successful serious opera, although other comedies were to appear quite quickly.

With his commissions, the years from 1830 to 1835 saw a huge outpouring of work; &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot;, a comedy produced in 1832, came soon after &quot;Anna Bolena&quot;″s success and is deemed to be one of the masterpieces of 19th-century &quot;opera buffa&quot;.

Then came a rapid series of operas from Naples including &quot;Francesca di Foix&quot; (May 1831); &quot;La romanziera e l&#x27;uomo nero&quot; (June 1831); and &quot;Fausta&quot; (January 1832). Two new operas were presented in Milan: &quot;Le convenienze ed inconvenienze teatrali&quot; (April 1831) and &quot;Ugo, conte di Parigi&quot; (March 1832). Rome presented &quot;Il furioso all&#x27;isola di San Domingo&quot; (January 1833) and &quot;Torquato Tasso&quot; (September 1833). &quot;Otto mesi in due ore&quot; (1833) was given in Livorno and &quot;Parisina&quot; (March 1833) was given in Florence.

After the successful staging of &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot; in 1833, his reputation was further consolidated, and Donizetti followed the paths of both Rossini and Bellini by visiting Paris, where his &quot;Marin Faliero&quot; was given at the Théâtre-Italien in March 1835. However, it suffered by comparison to Bellini&#x27;s &quot;I puritani&quot; which appeared at the same time.

Donizetti returned from Paris to oversee the staging of &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; on 26 September 1835. It was set to a libretto by Salvadore Cammarano, the first of eight for the composer. The opera was based on &quot;The Bride of Lammermoor&quot;, the novel by Sir Walter Scott, and it was to become his most famous opera, one of the high points of the &quot;bel canto&quot; tradition, the opera reaching a stature similar to that achieved by Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Norma&quot;.

This &quot;dramma tragico&quot; appeared at a time when several factors were moving Donizetti&#x27;s reputation as a composer of opera to greater heights: Gioachino Rossini had recently retired and Vincenzo Bellini had died shortly before the premiere of &quot;Lucia&quot; leaving Donizetti as &quot;the sole reigning genius of Italian opera&quot;. Not only were conditions ripe for Donizetti to achieve greater fame as a composer, but there was also an interest across the continent of Europe in the history and culture of Scotland. The perceived romance of its violent wars and feuds, as well as its folklore and mythology, intrigued 19th century readers and audiences, and Scott made use of these stereotypes in his novel.

At the same time, continental audiences of that time seemed to be fascinated by the Tudor period of 16th century English history, revolving as it does around the lives of King Henry VIII (and his six wives), Mary I of England (&quot;Bloody Mary&quot;), Queen Elizabeth I, as well as the doomed Mary, Queen of Scots. Many of these historical characters appear in Donizetti&#x27;s dramas, operas which both preceded and followed &quot;Anna Bolena&quot;. They were &quot;Elisabetta al castello di Kenilworth&quot;, based on Scribe&#x27;s &quot;Leicester&quot; and Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Amy Robsart&quot; (given in Naples in July 1829 and revised in 1830). Then came &quot;Maria Stuarda&quot; (&quot;Mary Stuart&quot;), based on Schiller&#x27;s play and given at La Scala in December 1835. It was followed by the third in the &quot;Three Donizetti Queens&quot; series, &quot;Roberto Devereux&quot;, which features the relationship between Elizabeth and the Earl of Essex. It was given at the San Carlo in Naples in October 1837.

As Donizetti&#x27;s fame grew, so did his engagements. He was offered commissions by both La Fenice in Venice—a house he had not visited for about seventeen years and to which he returned to present &quot;Belisario&quot; on 4 February 1836. Just as importantly, after the success of his &quot;Lucia&quot; at the Théâtre-Italien in Paris in December 1837, approaches came from the Paris Opéra. As musicologists Roger Parker and William Ashbrook have stated, &quot;negotiations with Charles Duponchel, the director of the Opéra, took on a positive note for the first time&quot; and &quot;the road to Paris lay open for him&quot;, the first Italian to obtain a commission to write a real grand opera.

===1838–1840: Donizetti abandons Naples for Paris===
In October 1838, Donizetti moved to Paris vowing never to have dealings with the San Carlo again after the King of Naples banned the production of &quot;Poliuto&quot; on the grounds that such a sacred subject was inappropriate for the stage. In Paris, he offered &quot;Poliuto&quot; to the Opéra and it was set to a new and expanded four-act French-language libretto by Eugène Scribe with the title, &quot;Les Martyrs&quot;. Performed in April 1840, it was his first grand opera in the French tradition and was quite successful. Before leaving that city in June 1840, he had time to oversee the translation of &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; into &quot;Lucie de Lammermoor&quot; as well as to write &quot;La fille du régiment&quot;, his first opera written specifically to a French libretto. This became another success.

===1840–1843: back and forth between Paris, Milan, Vienna, and Naples===
After leaving Paris in June 1840, Donizetti was to write ten new operas, although not all were performed in his lifetime. Before arriving in Milan by August 1840, he visited Switzerland and then his hometown of Bergamo, eventually reaching Milan where he was to prepare an Italian version of &quot;La fille du régiment&quot;. No sooner was that accomplished than he was back in Paris to adapt the never-performed 1839 libretto &quot;L&#x27;Ange de Nisida&quot; as the French-language &quot;La favorite&quot;, the premiere of which took place on 2 December 1840. Then he rushed back to Milan for Christmas, but returned almost immediately and by late February 1841 was preparing a new opera, &quot;Rita, ou Deux hommes et une femme&quot;. However, it was not staged until 1860.

Donizetti returned once more to Milan where he stayed with the accommodating Giuseppina Appiano Stringeli with whom he had a pleasant time. Unwilling to leave Milan, but encouraged to return to Paris by Michele Accursi (with whom the composer was to be involved in Paris in 1843), he oversaw the December production of &quot;Maria Padilla&quot; at La Scala, and began writing &quot;Linda di Chamounix&quot; in preparation for March 1842 travels to Vienna, in which city he had been engaged by the royal court.

During this time and prior to leaving for Vienna, he was persuaded to conduct the premiere of Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Stabat Mater&quot; in Bologna in March 1842. Friends—including his brother-in-law, Antonio Vasselli (known as Totò)—continually attempted to persuade him to take up an academic position in Bologna rather than the Vienna court engagement, if for no other reason that it would give the composer a base from which to work and teach and not be continually exhausting himself with travel between cities. But in a letter to Vasselli, he adamantly refused.

When Donizetti went to Bologna for the &quot;Stabat Mater&quot;, Rossini attended the third performance, and the two men—each former students of the Bologna Conservatory—met for the first time, with Rossini declaring that Donizetti was &quot;the only maestro in Italy capable of conducting my &quot;Stabat&quot; as I would have it&quot;.

Arriving in Vienna in the Spring of 1842 with a letter of recommendation from Rossini, Donizetti became involved in rehearsals for &quot;Linda di Chamounix&quot;, which was given its premiere in May and which was a huge success. In addition, he was appointed kapellmeister to the chapel of the royal court, the same post which had been held by Mozart.

He left Vienna on 1 July 1842 after the Spring Italian season, travelling to Milan, Bergamo (in order to see the now-aging Mayr, but where the deterioration of his own health became more apparent), and then on to Naples in August, a city he had not visited since 1838. A contract with the San Carlo remained unresolved. Also, it appears that he wished to sell his Naples house, but could not bring himself to go through with it, such was the sorrow which remained after his wife&#x27;s death in 1837.

However, on 6 September he was on his way back to Genoa from where he would leave for a three-month planned stay in Paris to be followed by time in Vienna once again. He wrote that he would work on translations of &quot;Maria Padilla&quot; and &quot;Linda di Chamounix&quot; and &quot;God knows what else I&#x27;ll do&quot;. During the time in Naples, his poor health was again a problem causing him to remain in bed for days at a time.

Arriving once again in Paris in late September 1842, he accomplished the revisions to the two Italian operas and he received a suggestion from Jules Janin, the newly appointed director of the &quot;Théâtre-Italien&quot;, that he might compose a new opera for that house. Janin&#x27;s idea was that it should be a new &quot;opera buffa&quot; and tailored to the talents of some major singers including Giulia Grisi, Antonio Tamburini, and Luigi Lablache who had been hired. The result turned out to be the comic opera, &quot;Don Pasquale&quot;, planned for January 1843. While preparations were underway, other ideas came to Donizetti and, discovering Cammarano&#x27;s libretto for Giuseppe Lillo&#x27;s unsuccessful 1839 &quot;Il Conte di Chalais&quot;, he turned it into the first two acts of &quot;Maria di Rohan&quot; within twenty-four hours. Another opera with Scribe as librettist was in the works: it was to be &quot;Dom Sébastien, roi de Portugal&quot; planned for November 1843 in Paris.

When &quot;Don Pasquale&quot; was presented on 3 January, it was an overwhelming success with performances continuing until late March. Writing in the &quot;Journal des débats&quot; on 6 January, the critic Étienne-Jean Delécluze proclaimed:

===1843–1845: Paris to Vienna to Italy; final return to Paris===
By 1843, Donizetti was exhibiting symptoms of syphilis and probable bipolar disorder: &quot;the inner man was broken, sad, and incurably sick&quot;, states Allitt. Ashbrook observes that the preoccupation with work which obsessed Donizetti in the last months of 1842 and throughout 1843 &quot;suggests that he recognised what was wrong with him and that he wanted to compose as much as he could while he was still able&quot;. But after the success in Paris, he continued working and left once again for Vienna, arriving there by mid-January 1843.

Shortly thereafter, he wrote to Antonio Vasselli outlining his plans for that year, concluding with the somewhat ominous: &quot;All of this with a new illness contracted in Paris, which has still not passed and for which I am awaiting your prescription.&quot; But, in the body of the letter, he lays out what he will be aiming to accomplish in 1843: in Vienna, a French drama; in Naples, a planned &quot;Ruy-Blas&quot; [but it was never composed]; in Paris for the Opéra-Comique, &quot;a Flemish subject&quot;, and for the Opéra, &quot;I am using a Portuguese subject in five acts&quot; (which was to be &quot;Dom Sébastien, Roi de Portugal&quot;, and actually given on 13 November.) Finally, he adds &quot;and first I am remounting &quot;Les Martyrs&quot; which is creating a furor in the provinces&quot;.

However, by early February, he is already writing via an intermediary to Vincenzo Flauto, then the impresario at the San Carlo in Naples, in an attempt to break his agreement to compose for that house in July. He was increasingly becoming aware of the limitations which his poor health is imposing upon him. As it turned out, he was able to revive a half-completed work which had been started for Vienna, but only after receiving a rejection to his request to be released from his Naples&#x27; obligations did he work on finishing &quot;Caterina Cornaro&quot; by May for a production in Naples in January 1844, but without the composer being present. When it did appear, it was not very successful. As far as the work for the Opéra-Comique was concerned—&quot;Ne m&#x27;oubliez moi&quot; it was to be called—it appears that he was able to break his contract with that house, although he had already composed and orchestrated seven numbers.

====Work in Vienna====

Donizetti&#x27;s obligations in Vienna included overseeing the annual Italian season at the Theater am Kärntnertor which began in May. Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Nabucco&quot; (which Donizetti had seen in Milan at its premiere in March 1842 and with which he had been impressed) was featured as part of that season. However, his main preoccupation was to complete the orchestration of &quot;Maria di Rohan&quot;, which was accomplished by 13 February for planned performances in June. The season began with a very successful revival of &quot;Linda di Chamounix&quot;. &quot;Nabucco&quot; followed, the first production of a Verdi opera in Vienna. The season also included &quot;Don Pasquale&quot; in addition to &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;. Finally, &quot;Maria di Rohan&quot; was given on 5 June. In reporting the reaction to this opera in a teasing letter to Antonio Vasselli in Rome, he tried to build suspense, stating that &quot;With the utmost sorrow, I must announce to you that last evening I have given my &quot;Maria di Rohan&quot; [and he names the singers]. All their talent was not enough to save me from &quot;a sea of [pause, space] – applause...Everything went well. Everything.&quot;

====Return to Paris====

Returning to Paris as quickly as possible, Donizetti left Vienna around 11 July 1843 in his newly purchased carriage and arrived on about 20th, immediately getting down to work on finishing &quot;Dom Sébastien&quot;, which he describes as a massive enterprise: &quot;what a staggering spectacle...I am terribly wearied by this enormous opera in five acts which carries bags full of music for singing and dancing.&quot; It is his longest opera as well as the one on which he spent the most time.

With rehearsals in progress at the Opéra for &quot;Dom Sébastien&quot;, the first performance being planned for 13 November, the composer was also working on readying &quot;Maria di Rohan&quot; for the Théâtre-Italien on the following evening, 14 November. Both were successful, although author Herbert Weinstock states that &quot;the older opera was an immediate, unquestioned success with both audience and critics&quot;. However, &quot;Maria di Rohan&quot; continued for 33 performances in all, whereas &quot;Dom Sébastien&quot; remained in the repertory until 1845 with a total of 32 performances.

====1844: in Vienna====
On 30 December 1843, Donizetti was back in Vienna, having delayed leaving until the 20th because of illness. Ashbrook comments on how he was viewed in that city, with &quot;friends notic[ing] an alarming change in his physical condition&quot;, and with his ability to concentrate and simply to remaining standing often being impaired.

Having entered into a contract with Léon Pillet of the Opéra for a new work for the coming year, he found nothing to be suitable and immediately wrote to Pillet proposing that another composer take his place. While waiting to see if he could be relieved from writing a large-scale work if Giacomo Meyerbeer would allow &quot;Le Prophète&quot; to be staged instead that autumn, he looked forward to the arrival of his brother from Turkey in May and to the prospect of their traveling to Italy together that summer. Eventually, it was agreed that his commitment to the Opéra could be postponed until November 1845.

While taking care of some of his obligations to the Viennese court, for the remainder of the month he awaited news on the outcome of the 12 January premiere of &quot;Caterina Cornaro&quot; in Naples. By the 31st (or 1 February), he learned the truth: it had been a failure. What was worse were the rumours that it was not in fact Donizetti&#x27;s work, although a report from Guido Zavadini suggested that it was probably a combination of elements which caused the failure, including the singers&#x27; difficulty in finding the right tone in the absence of the maestro, plus the heavily censored libretto. Primarily, however, the opera&#x27;s failure appears to have been due to the maestro&#x27;s absence, because he was unable to be present to oversee and control the staging, normally one of Donizetti&#x27;s strengths.

The Italian season in Vienna, which included Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Norma&quot; and revivals of &quot;Linda di Chamounix&quot; and of &quot;Don Pasquale&quot;, also included the first production there of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Ernani&quot;. Donizetti had made a promise to Giacomo Pedroni of the publishing house Casa Ricordi to oversee the production of the opera, which was given on 30 May with Donizetti conducting. The result was a very warm letter from Giuseppe Verdi entrusting the production to his care; it concluded: &quot;With the most profound esteem, your most devoted servant, G. Verdi.&quot;

====Summer/Autumn 1844: travel to and within Italy====

Gaetano&#x27;s brother Giuseppe, on leave from Constantinople, arrived in Vienna in early June. He had intended to leave by about 22nd, but Gaetano&#x27;s bout of illness delayed his departure, and the brothers traveled together to Bergamo on about 12 or 13 July proceeding slowly but arriving around the 21st.

William Ashbrook describes the second half of 1844 as a period of &quot;pathetic restlessness&quot;. He continues: &quot;Donizetti went to Bergamo, Lovere on Lake Iseo [about 26 miles from Bergamo], back to Bergamo, to Milan [31 July], to Genoa [with his friend Antonio Dolci, on 3 August, where they stayed until 10 August because of illness], to Naples [by steamer, from which he wrote to Vasselli in Rome explaining that the upcoming visit may be last time he would see his brother], [then] to Rome [on 14 September to see Vasselli], back to Naples [on 2 October after being invited back to Naples for the first San Carlo performances of &quot;Maria di Rohan&quot; on 11 November, which was immensely successful], to Genoa [on 14 November by boat; arrived on the 19th] and on to Milan again [for two days]&quot; before reaching Bergamo on 23 November, where his found his old friend Mayr to be very ill. He delayed his departure for as long as possible, but Mayr died on 2 December, shortly after Donizetti had left Bergamo.

====December 1844 – July 1845: last visit to Vienna====
By 5 December he was in Vienna writing a letter to his friend Guglielmo Cottrau on 6th and again on 12th, stating &quot;I am not well. I am in the hands of a doctor.&quot; While there were periods of relative calm, his health continued to fail him periodically and then there were relapses into depression, as expressed in a letter: &quot;I am half-destroyed, it&#x27;s a miracle that I&#x27;m still on my feet.&quot;

Writing to unnamed Paris friends on 7 February, even after the very positive reaction received at the premiere of a specially-prepared &quot;Dom Sébastien&quot; on 6 February 1845 (which he had conducted for three performances of the total of 162 given over the following years until 1884), he grumbles about the reactions of the Parisian audiences and continues with a brief report on his health which, he says, &quot;if it is no better and this continues, I&#x27;ll find myself forced to go to spend some months resting in Bergamo.&quot; At the same time, he rejected offers to compose, one offer coming from London and requiring an opera four months away; the objection of having limited time was given. Other appeals came from Paris, one directly from Vatel, the new impresario of the Théâtre-Italien, who traveled to Vienna to see the composer. As other biographers also note, there is an increasing sense that, during 1845, Donizetti became more and more aware of the real state of his health and the limitations it has begun to impose on his activities. Other letters into April and May reveal much of the same, and the fact that he did not attend the opening performance of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;I due Foscari&quot; on 3 April, finally seeing it only at its fourth performance, confirms that.

By the end of May, no decision as what to do or where to go had been made, but—finally—he decided on Paris where he would claim a forfeit from the Opéra for the non-production of &quot;Le duc d&#x27;Albe&quot;, his unfulfilled second commission from 1840 which, although still unfinished, had a completed libretto. He left Vienna for the last time on 10 July 1845.

===1845–1848: return to Paris; declining health; return to Bergamo; death===

By the time he reached Paris, Donizetti had been suffering from malaises, headaches, and nausea for decades, but had never been formally treated. In early August, he initiated a lawsuit against the Opéra which dragged on until April 1846 and in which he prevailed.

The culmination of the crisis in Donizetti&#x27;s health came in August 1845 when he was diagnosed with cerebro-spinal syphilis and severe mental illness. Two doctors, including Dr. Philippe Ricord (a specialist in syphilis), recommended that, along with various remedies, he abandon work altogether and both agreed that the Italian climate would be better for his health. But letters to friends reveal two things: that he continued to work on &quot;Gemma di Vergy&quot; that autumn for its performance in Paris on 16 December, and that he revealed a lot about the progression of his illness.

As his condition worsened, the composer&#x27;s brother Giuseppe dispatched his son Andrea to Paris from Constantinople. Arriving there on 25 December, Andrea lodged at the Hôtel Manchester with his uncle, but immediately consulted Dr. Ricord on his uncle&#x27;s condition. Ricord recorded his opinion in mid-January that, while it ultimately might be better for the composer&#x27;s health for him to be in Italy, it was not advisable for him to travel until the spring. Consulting two additional doctors as well as Dr. Ricord, Andrea received their written opinion after an examination on 28 January 1846. In summary, it stated that the doctors &quot;believe that M. Donizetti no longer is capable of calculating sanely the significance of his decisions&quot;.

====Institutionalization====
In February 1846, reluctant to consider going further towards institutionalization, he relied on the further advice of two of the doctors who had examined his uncle in late January. They stated:

Therefore, Andrea agreed to allow his uncle to be taken to a facility which has been described as &quot;resemb[ling] that of a health spa... with a central hospital more-or-less in the guise of a country house&quot; and Donizetti left Paris by coach with Andrea, believing that they were travelling to Vienna, where he was due by 12 February to fulfill his contract. Following behind in another coach was Dr. Ricord. After three hours they arrived at the Maison Esquirol in Ivry-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris, where an explanation involving an accident was concocted to explain the need to spend the night at a &quot;comfortable inn&quot;. Within a few days—realizing that he was being confined—Donizetti wrote urgent letters seeking help from friends, but they were never delivered. However, evidence provided from friends who visited Donizetti over the following months, states that he was being treated very well, the facility having a reputation for the care given to its patients. Various aggressive treatments were tried, and were described as having their &quot;successes, however fleeting&quot;.

By the end of May, Andrea had decided that his uncle would be better off in the Italian climate, and three outside physicians were called in for their opinions. Their report concluded with the advice that he leave for Italy without delay. But, as Andrea began to make plans for his uncle&#x27;s journey to and upkeep in Bergamo, he was forced by the Paris Prefect of Police to have his uncle undergo another examination by other physicians appointed by the Prefect. Their conclusion was the opposite of that of the previous doctors: &quot;we are of the opinion that the trip should be forbidden formally as offering very real dangers and being far from allowing hope of any useful result.&quot; With that, the Prefect informed Andrea that Donizetti could not be moved from Ivry. Andrea saw little use in remaining in Paris. He sought a final opinion from the three doctors practicing at the clinic, and on 30 August, they provided a lengthy report outlining step-by-step the complete physical condition of their declining patient, concluding that the rigours of travel—the jolting of the carriage, for example—could bring on new symptoms or complications impossible to treat on such a journey. Andrea left for Bergamo on 7 (or 8) September 1846, taking with him a partial score of &quot;Le duc d&#x27;Albe&quot;, the completed score of &quot;Rita&quot;, and a variety of personal effects, including jewelry.

====Attempts to move Donizetti back to Paris====

In late December, early January 1847, visits from a friend from Vienna who lived in Paris—Baron Eduard von Lannoy—resulted in a letter from Lannoy to Giuseppe Donizetti in Constantinople outlining what he saw as a better solution: rather than have friends travel the five hours to see his brother, Lannoy recommended that Gaetano be moved to Paris where he could be taken care of by the same doctors. Giuseppe agreed and sent Andrea back to Paris, which he reached on 23 April. Visiting his uncle the following day, he found himself recognized. He was able to go on to convince the Paris Prefect, by threats of family action and general public concern, that the composer should be moved to an apartment in Paris. This took place on 23 June and, while there, he was able to take rides in his carriage and appeared to be much more aware of his surroundings. However, he was held under virtual house arrest by the police for several more months, although able to be visited by friends and even by Verdi while he was in Paris. Finally—on 16 August—in Constantinople, Giuseppe filed a formal complaint with the Austrian ambassador (given that the composer was an Austrian citizen).

In Paris, the police insisted on a further medical examination. Six doctors were called in and, of the six, only four approved of the travel. Then the police sent in their own doctor (who opposed the move), posted gendarmes outside the apartment, and forbade the daily carriage rides. Now desperate, Andrea then consulted three lawyers and sent detailed reports to his father in Constantinople. Finally, action taken by Count Sturmer of the Austrian Embassy in Turkey caused action to be taken from Vienna which, via the Embassy in Paris, sent a formal complaint to the French government. Within a few days, Donizetti was given permission to leave and he set out from Paris on what was to be a seventeen-day trip to Bergamo.

====Final journey to Bergamo====

Arrangements had been made well ahead of time as to where Donizetti would live when he arrived in Bergamo. In fact, on his second visit to Paris, when it appeared that his uncle would return to Italy, Andrea had an agreement from the noble Scotti family for his uncle to be able to stay in their palace. The accompanying party of four consisted of Andrea, the composer&#x27;s younger brother Francesco who had come specially from Bergamo for this purpose, Dr. Rendu, and nurse-custodian Antoine Pourcelot. They traveled by train to Amiens, then on to Brussels, after which they traveled in two coaches (one of which was Donizetti&#x27;s, sent ahead to await the party). They crossed Belgium and Germany to Switzerland, crossing the Alps via the St Gotthard Pass, and came down into Italy arriving in Bergamo on the evening of 6 October, where they were welcomed by friends as well as the mayor.
Based on the report of the accompanying doctor, Donizetti did not appear to have suffered from the journey. He was settled comfortably in a large chair, speaking very rarely or only in occasional monosyllables, and mostly remaining detached from everyone around him. However, when Giovannina Basoni (who eventually became Baroness Scotti) played and sang arias from the composer&#x27;s operas, he did appear to pay some attention. On the other hand, when the tenor Rubini visited and, together with Giovannina, sang music from &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;, Antonio Vasselli reported that there was no sign of recognition at all. This condition continued well into 1848, more or less unchanged until a serious bout of apoplexy occurred on 1 April followed by further decline and the inability to take in food. Finally, after the intense night of 7 April, Gaetano Donizetti died on the afternoon of 8 April.

Initially Donizetti was buried in the cemetery of Valtesse but in 1875 his body was transferred to Bergamo&#x27;s Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore near the grave of his teacher Simon Mayr.

==Personal life==

During the months he spent in Rome for the production of &quot;Zoraida&quot; Donizetti met the Vasselli family, with Antonio initially becoming a good friend. Antonio&#x27;s sister Virginia was at that point 13. She became Donizetti&#x27;s wife in 1828. She gave birth to three children, none of whom survived and, within a year of his parents&#x27; deaths—on 30 July 1837—she also died from what is believed to be cholera or measles, but Ashbrook speculates that it was connected to what he describes as a &quot;severe syphilitic infection.&quot;

By nine years, he was the younger brother of Giuseppe Donizetti, who had become, in 1828, Instructor General of the Imperial Ottoman Music at the court of Sultan Mahmud II (1808–1839). The youngest of the three brothers was Francesco whose life was spent entirely in Bergamo, except for a brief visit to Paris during his brother&#x27;s decline. He survived him by only eight months.

==Critical reception==
After the death of Bellini, Donizetti was the most significant composer of Italian opera until Verdi. His reputation fluctuated, but since the 1940s and 1950s his work has been increasingly performed. His best known operas today are &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;, &quot;La fille du régiment&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot; and &quot;Don Pasquale&quot;.

==Donizetti&#x27;s compositions==
Donizetti, a prolific composer, is best known for his operatic works, but he also wrote music in a number of other forms, including some church music, a number of string quartets, and some orchestral pieces. Altogether, he composed about 75 operas, 16 symphonies, 19 string quartets, 193 songs, 45 duets, 3 oratorios, 28 cantatas, instrumental concertos, sonatas, and other chamber pieces.

<doc id="37935" wikidata="Q694356" url="?curid=37935" title="Bell OH-58 Kiowa">
<text>The Bell OH-58 Kiowa is a family of single-engine single-rotor military helicopters used for observation, utility, and direct fire support. It was produced by the American manufacturer Bell Helicopter and is closely related to the Model 206A JetRanger civilian helicopter.

The OH-58 was originally developed during the early 1960s as the &quot;D-250&quot; for the Light Observation Helicopter (LOH). While the rival Hughes OH-6 Cayuse was picked over Bell&#x27;s submission in May 1965, the company refined its design to create the Model 206A, a variant of which it successfully submitted to the reopened LOH competition two years later. The initial model, designated by the service as the &quot;OH-58A&quot;, was introduced in May 1969. Successive models would follow, often with uprated engines, enhanced protection systems, and other improvements, culminating in the &quot;OH-58F&quot;. Additional improvements, such as the &quot;OH-58X&quot;, were proposed but ultimately not pursued.

During the 1970s, the US Army became interested in pursuing an advanced scout helicopter, for which the OH-58 would be further developed, evaluated, and ultimately procured as the &quot;OH-58D Kiowa Warrior&quot;. The OH-58D is equipped to perform armed reconnaissance missions and to provide fire support to friendly ground forces; it is equipped with a distinctive Mast Mounted Sight (MMS) containing various sensors for target acquisition and laser designation. Another visible feature present on most OH-58s are knife-like extensions above and below the cockpit that form part of the passive wire strike protection system. The early-build OH-58s were equipped with a two-bladed main rotor, while the OH-58D and newer variants have a four-bladed rotor.

The OH-58 was primarily produced for the United States Army. Only two months after the type&#x27;s entry to service, it was first deployed into the Vietnam War. The US Army would make extensive use of various OH-58 models across numerous war zones over the decades, seeing active combat during the Gulf War, the Invasion of Panama, and the War in Afghanistan among others. During 2017, the US Army opted to withdraw its remaining OH-58s, making use of alternative rotorcraft, such as the Boeing AH-64 Apache and Eurocopter UH-72 Lakota, as well as increasing use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), to fill the role. Furthermore, the OH-58 has been exported to Austria, Canada, Croatia, the Dominican Republic, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, and Greece. It has also been produced under license in Australia.

==Development==
===Light Observation Helicopter (LOH)===
On 14 October 1960, the United States Navy approached 25 helicopter manufacturers to request on behalf of the Army the submission of proposals for a Light Observation Helicopter (LOH). Bell Helicopter was one of the manufacturers approached, and chose to enter the competition along with 12 other manufacturers, including Hiller Aircraft and Hughes Tool Co., Aircraft Division. Bell&#x27;s design was internally referred to as the &quot;D-250&quot;, and would be officially designated as the &quot;YHO-4&quot;. On 19 May 1961, Bell and Hiller were announced as winners of the design competition.
Bell developed the D-250 design into the &quot;Model 206&quot;, while the HO-4 designation was changed to &quot;YOH-4A&quot; in 1962, and produced five prototype aircraft for the Army&#x27;s test and evaluation phase. On 8 December 1962, the first prototype performed its maiden flight. The YOH-4A was also called the &quot;Ugly Duckling&quot; in comparison to other contending aircraft. After a fly off of the Bell, Hughes and Fairchild-Hiller prototypes, the Hughes OH-6 Cayuse was selected in May 1965.

When the YOH-4A was rejected by the Army, Bell went about solving the problem of marketing the aircraft. In addition to the image problem, the helicopter lacked cargo space and only provided cramped quarters for the planned three passengers in the back. The solution was a fuselage redesigned to be more sleek and aesthetic, adding of cargo space in the process. The redesigned aircraft was designated as the &quot;Model 206A&quot;, and Bell President Edwin J. Ducayet named it the &quot;JetRanger&quot; denoting an evolution from the popular Model 47J &quot;Ranger&quot;.

In 1967, the Army reopened the LOH competition for bids because Hughes Tool Co. Aircraft Division could not meet the contractual production demands. Bell resubmitted for the program using the Bell 206A. Fairchild-Hiller failed to resubmit their bid with the YOH-5A, which they had successfully marketed as the FH-1100. In the end, Bell underbid Hughes to win the contract and the Bell 206A was designated as the OH-58A. Following the U.S. Army&#x27;s naming convention for helicopters, the OH-58A was named &quot;Kiowa&quot; in honor of the Native American tribe.

===Advanced Scout Helicopter===
In the 1970s, the U.S. Army began evaluating the need to improve the capabilities of their scout aircraft. Anticipating the AH-64A&#x27;s replacement of the venerable AH-1, the Army began shopping the idea of an Aerial Scout Program to stimulate the development of advanced technological capabilities for night vision and precision navigation equipment. The stated goals of the program included prototypes that would: ...possess an extended target acquisition range capability by means of a long-range stabilized optical subsystem for the observer, improved position location through use of a computerized navigation system, improved survivability by reducing aural, visual, radar, and infrared signatures, and an improved flight performance capability derived from a larger engine to provide compatibility with attack helicopters.

During March 1974, the Army created a special task force at Fort Knox to develop the system requirements; by the following year, the task force had devised the requirements for an Advanced Scout Helicopter (ASH) program. The requirements were formulated around an rotorcraft capable of performing in day, night, and adverse weather, and compatible with all advanced weapons systems planned for development and fielding into the 1980s. The program was approved by the System Acquisition Review Council and the Army prepared for competitive development to begin the next year. However, as the Army tried to get the program off the ground, Congress declined to provide funding in the fiscal year 1977 budget and the ASH Project Manager&#x27;s Office (PM-ASH) was closed on 30 September 1976.

While no development occurred for some years, the program survived as a requirement without funding. On 30 November 1979, the decision was made to defer development of an advanced scout helicopter in favor of modifying existing airframes in inventory as a near term scout helicopter (NTSH) option. The development of a mast-mounted sight would be the primary focus to improve the ability to perform reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition missions while remaining hidden behind trees and terrain. Both the UH-1 and the OH-58 were evaluated as NTSH candidates, but the UH-1 was dropped from consideration due to its larger size and ease of detection. The OH-58, on the other hand demonstrated a dramatic reduction in detectability with a Mast-Mounted Sight (MMS).

On 10 July 1980, the Army decided that the NTSH would be a competitive modification program based on developments in the commercial helicopter sector, particularly Hughes Helicopters&#x27; Hughes 500D, which had made major improvements over the OH-6.

===Army Helicopter Improvement Program (AHIP)===
The Army&#x27;s decision to acquire the NTSH resulted in the &quot;Army Helicopter Improvement Program (AHIP)&quot;. Both Bell Helicopter and Hughes Helicopters redesigned their scout aircraft to compete for the contract. Bell offered a more robust version of the OH-58 in their &quot;Model 406&quot;, and Hughes offered an upgraded version of the OH-6. On 21 September 1981, Bell Helicopter Textron was awarded a development contract. On 6 October 1983, the first prototype performed its maiden flight, and the aircraft entered service two years later as the OH-58D.

Initially intended for attack, cavalry, and artillery roles, the Army only approved a low initial production level and confined the OH-58D&#x27;s role to field artillery observation. The Army also directed that a follow-on test be conducted to further evaluate it due to perceived deficiencies. On 1 April 1986, the Army formed a task force at Fort Rucker, Alabama, to remedy deficiencies in the AHIP. During 1988, the Army had planned to discontinue the OH-58D and focus on the LHX; however, Congress approved $138 million to expand the program, calling for the AHIP to operate with the Apache as a hunter/killer team; the AHIP would locate targets and the Apache would destroy them in a throwback to the traditional OH-58/AH-1 relationship.

The Secretary of the Army directed instead that the aircraft&#x27;s armament systems be upgraded, based on experience with Task Force 118&#x27;s performance operating armed OH-58Ds in the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Prime Chance, and that the type be used primarily for scouting and armed reconnaissance. The armed aircraft would be known as the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior, denoting its new armed configuration. Beginning with the 202nd aircraft (s/n 89-0112) in May 1991, all remaining OH-58Ds were produced in the Kiowa Warrior configuration. During January 1992, Bell received its first retrofit contract to convert all remaining OH-58Ds to the Kiowa Warrior configuration.

===Production===
Overall 2,325 OH-58 were produced, with an additional 56 Bell 206B-1 also built. Production of new airframes for the A and B models ended in 1977, and the D model in 2000. Conversions of early models to the D standard continued afterward.

== Design ==
The Bell OH-58 Kiowa is a family of single-engine single-rotor military helicopters principally used for observation, utility, and direct fire support. The primary role of the original OH-58A was to identify targets for other platforms, such as the Bell AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter and ground artillery; it lacked any armaments and weighed 1,451 kg (3,200 lb) when fully loaded, being able to carry a small amount of cargo or up to two passengers. While initial examples were reliant on the crew to conduct observations, later models were furnished with sophisticated sensors to precisely determine a target&#x27;s location. Payload capacity was also increased considerably on later-build rotorcraft, the OH-58D Kiowa was designed to carry a maximum load of 2,495 kg, 72% more capacity than the original version.

Early Kiowas were fitted with a flexible twin-bladed main rotor; starting with the OH-58D, a four-bladed rigid main rotor was used. This was entirely composed of composite materials, the OH-58D was the first US Army rotorcraft to incorporate an all-composite main rotor hub. Later models were outfitted as light gunships, being equipped with various armaments, such as Stinger air-to-air missiles, a .50-caliber machine gun, podded 70mm Hydra rockets and AGM-114 Hellfire air to ground missiles. Other areas of improvement were the avionics and the cockpit; new navigation and communication systems were installed along with new and larger flight instrumentation, while all light sources were redesigned for compatibility with Night Vision Goggles (NVG). Later versions were outfitted with a glass cockpit, which retained conventional instrumentation as a fallback measure.
The OH-58D introduced perhaps the most distinctive feature of the Kiowa family — the Mast Mounted Sight (MMS), which resembles a beach ball perched above the rotor system. The MMS by Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies has a gyro-stabilized platform containing a television system (TVS), a thermal imaging system (TIS), and a laser range finder/designator (LRF/D). These features gave the OH-58D the additional mission capability of target acquisition and laser designation in day or night, limited-visibility and adverse weather. In combination with the 1553 databus, the OH-58D being first US Army helicopter to be fielded with such equipment, target data from the sensors could be directly passed to precision-guided weapons.

The MMS was developed by the McDonnell Douglas Corp. in Huntington Beach, CA. Production took place primarily at facilities in Monrovia, CA. As a result of a merger with Boeing, and a later sale of the business unit, the program is currently owned and managed by DRS Technologies, with engineering support based in Cypress, CA, and production support taking place in Melbourne, FL. On the OH-58F, the MMS was removed, its functions having been replaced by the AAS-53 Common Sensor Payload, which is mounted on the chin.

One distinctive feature of operational OH-58s are the knife-like extensions above and below the cockpit which are part of the passive wire strike protection system; it protects 90% of the frontal area of the helicopter from wire strikes that can be encountered at low altitudes by directing wires to the upper or lower blades before they can entangle the rotor blade or landing skids. The OH-58 was the first helicopter to test this system, after which the system was adopted by the US Army for the OH-58 and most of their other helicopters. Various other defensive and survivability measures were incorporated, such as ballistic floor armor, a missile warning system, crashworthy seats, and infrared suppression systems for the engine exhaust.

==Operational history==
In May 1969, the first OH-58A Kiowa was officially received at a ceremony held at Bell Helicopter&#x27;s Fort Worth plant, officiated by Major General John Norton, commanding general of the Army Aviation Materiel Command (AMCOM). Two months later, on 17 August 1969, production OH-58A helicopters arrived in South Vietnam for the first time; their deployment was accompanied by a New Equipment Training Team (NETT) comprising personnel from both the US Army and Bell Helicopters. Although the Kiowa production contract had replaced the LOH contract with Hughes, the OH-58A did not automatically replace the OH-6A in operations; subsequently, the Kiowa and the Cayuse would continue operating in the same theater until the end of the conflict.

===Vietnam War===
On 27 March 1970, an OH-58A Kiowa (s/n 68-16785) was shot down over South Vietnam, one of the first OH-58A losses of the war. The pilot, Warrant Officer Ralph Quick Jr., was flying Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Benoski Jr. as an artillery spotter. After completing a battle damage assessment for a previous fire mission, the aircraft was damaged by .51 inch (13 mm) machine gun fire and crashed, killing both crew members. Approximately 45 OH-58A helicopters were destroyed during the Vietnam War due to combat losses and accidents. One of the last combat losses in the theatre was of an OH-58A (s/n 68-16888) from A Troop, 3-17th Cavalry, flown by First Lieutenant Thomas Knuckey. On 27 May 1971, Lieutenant Knuckey was also flying a battle damage assessment mission when his aircraft came under machine gun fire and exploded. Knuckey and his observer, Sergeant Philip Taylor, both died in the explosion.

===Operation Prime Chance===
During early 1988, it was decided that armed OH-58D (AHIP) helicopters from the 118th Aviation Task Force would be phased in to replace the SEABAT (AH-6/MH-6) teams of Task Force 160th to carry out Operation Prime Chance, the escort of oil tankers during the Iran–Iraq War. On 24 February 1988, two AHIP helicopters reported to the Mobile Sea Base Wimbrown VII, and the helicopter team (&quot;SEABAT&quot; team after their callsign) stationed on the barge returned to the United States. For the next few months, the AHIP helicopters on the Wimbrown VII shared patrol duties with the SEABAT team on the Hercules. Coordination proved difficult, despite frequent requests from TF-160, the SEABAT team on the Hercules was not replaced by an AHIP detachment until June 1988. The OH-58D helicopter crews involved in the operation received deck landing and underwater survival training from the Navy.

In November 1988, the number of OH-58D helicopters that supported Task Force 118 was reduced. However, the rotorcraft continued to operate from the Navy&#x27;s Mobile Sea Base &quot;Hercules&quot;, the frigate &quot;Underwood&quot;, and the destroyer &quot;Conolly&quot;. OH-58D operations primarily entailed reconnaissance flights at night, and depending on maintenance requirements and ship scheduling, Army helicopters usually rotated from the mobile sea base and other combatant ships to a land base every seven to fourteen days. On 18 September 1989, an OH-58D crashed during night gunnery practice and sank, but with no loss of personnel. When the Mobile Sea Base Hercules was deactivated in September 1989, all but five OH-58D helicopters redeployed to the continental United States.

===Gulf War===
During Operation Desert Shield (the build-up to Operation Desert Storm) U.S. Army OH-58Ds would exercise alongside USMC AH-1Ws and assist with targeting and laser spotting. However while this tactic worked and was effective, there is little evidence that this tactic was used, likely to a lack of OD-58Ds.
During Operation Desert Storm, 130 deployed OH-58D helicopters worked alongside the other Army attack helicopters, 145 AH-1 Cobras and 277 AH-64 Apaches, and participated in a wide variety of critical combat ground forces mission. During Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, the Kiowas collectively flew nearly 9,000 hours with a 92 percent fully mission capable rate. The Kiowa Warrior had the lowest ratio of maintenance hours to flight hours of any combat helicopter in the war.

Army attack helicopters also worked jointly with close air support and support aircraft such as the USAF A-10As, F-16A/Cs, EF-111As, EC-130H Compass Call, F-4G Phantom II &quot;Wild Weasel&quot;, and E-8 Joint STARS.

===RAID===
In 1989, Congress mandated that the Army National Guard would take part in the country&#x27;s &quot;War on Drugs&quot;, enabling them to aid federal, state and local law enforcement agencies with &quot;special congressional entitlements&quot;. In response, the Army National Guard Bureau created the Reconnaissance and Aerial Interdiction Detachments (RAID) in 1992, consisting of aviation units in 31 states with 76 specially modified OH-58A helicopters to assume the reconnaissance/interdiction role in the fight against illegal drugs. During 1994, 24 states conducted more than 1,200 aerial counterdrug reconnaissance and interdiction missions, conducting many of these missions at night. Eventually, the program was expanded to cover 32 states and consisting of 116 aircraft, including dedicated training aircraft at the Western Army Aviation Training Site (WAATS) in Marana, Arizona.

The RAID program&#x27;s mission has now been expanded to include the war against terrorism and supporting U.S. Border Patrol activities in support of homeland defense. The National Guard RAID units&#x27; Area of Operation (AO) is the only one in the Department of Defense that is wholly contained within the borders of the United States.

===Operation Just Cause and action in the 1990s===
During Operation Just Cause in 1989, a team consisting of an OH-58 and an AH-1 were part of the Aviation Task Force during the securing of Fort Amador in Panama. The OH-58 was fired upon by Panama Defense Force soldiers and crashed away, in the Bay of Panama. The pilot was rescued, but the co-pilot was killed in action.

On 17 December 1994, Army Chief Warrant Officers (CWO) David Hilemon and Bobby Hall left Camp Page, South Korea on a routine training mission along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Their flight was intended to be to a point known as Checkpoint 84, south of the DMZ &quot;no-fly zone&quot;, but the OH-58C Kiowa strayed nearly into the Kangwon Province, inside North Korean airspace, due to errors in navigating the snow-covered, rugged terrain. The helicopter was shot down by North Korean troops and CWO Hilemon was killed. CWO Hall was held captive and the North Korean government insisted that the crew had been spying. Five days of negotiations resulted in the North Koreans turning over Hilemon&#x27;s body to U.S. authorities. The negotiations failed to secure Hall&#x27;s immediate release. After 13 days in captivity, Hall was freed on 30 December, uninjured.

=== Afghanistan and Iraq ===

The U.S. Army employed the OH-58D during Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq and Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. Between a combination of combat and accidents, over 35 airframes have been lost, resulting in the deaths of 35 pilots. Their presence was also anecdotally credited with saving lives, having been used to rescue wounded despite their small size. In Iraq, OH-58Ds reportedly flew 72 hours per month, while in Afghanistan, the type flew 80 hours per month. During April 2013, Bell stated that the OH-58 collectively accumulated 820,000 combat hours, and had achieved a 90% mission capable rate.

===Retirement===
The U.S. Army&#x27;s first attempt to replace the OH-58 was the RAH-66 Comanche of the Light Helicopter Experimental program, which was canceled in 2004. Airframe age and losses led to the Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter program and the Bell ARH-70, which was canceled in 2008 due to cost overruns. The third replacement effort was the Armed Aerial Scout program. Due to uncertainty in the AAS program and fiscal restraints, the OH-58F&#x27;s planned retirement was extended from 2025 to 2036. The Kiowa&#x27;s scout role was supplemented by tactical unmanned aerial vehicles, the two platforms often acting in conjunction to provide reconnaissance to expose crews to less risk. The OH-58F had the ability to control UAVs directly to safely perform scout missions. In 2011, the Kiowa was scheduled to be replaced by the light version of the Future Vertical Lift aircraft in the 2030s.

In December 2013, the U.S. Army had 338 Kiowas in its active-duty force and 30 in the Army National Guard. The Army considered retiring the Kiowa as part of a wider restructuring to cut costs and reduce the variety of helicopters operated. The Analysis of Alternatives for the AAS program found that operating the Kiowa alongside RQ-7 Shadow UAVs was the most affordable and capable solution, while the AH-64E Apache Guardian was the most capable immediate solution. One proposal was to transfer all Army National Guard and Army Reserve AH-64s to the active Army for use as scouts to divest the OH-58. The Apache costs 50 percent more than the Kiowa to operate and maintain; studies note that had it been used in place of the Kiowa in Iraq and Afghanistan, total operating costs would have risen by $4 billion, but also saved $1 billion per year in operating and sustainment costs. UH-60 Black Hawks would transfer from the active Army to reserve and Guard units. The aim was to retire older helicopters and retain those with the best capabilities to save money. Retiring the Kiowa would fund Apache upgrades.

The Army placed 26 out of 335 OH-58Ds in non-flyable storage during 2014. In anticipation of divestment, the Army looked to see if other military branches, government agencies, and foreign customers had interest in buying the type. The Kiowas were considered to be well priced for foreign countries with limited resources; Bell had not yet agreed to support them if sold overseas. Media expected OH-58s to go to foreign militaries rather than civil operators due to high operating cost. By 2015, the Army had divested 33 OH-58Ds. By January 2016, the Army had divested all but two OH-58D squadrons. In June 2016, members of 1st Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment, 82nd Combat Aviation Brigade, arrived in South Korea as part of the Kiowa&#x27;s last deployment in U.S. Army service; during the following year, the unit reequipped with AH-64s. In January 2017, the last Kiowa Warrior performed their last live fire maneuver before retirement.

Ex-U.S. Army OH-58Ds were made available through Excess Defense Article and foreign military sales (FMS) programs. In November 2014, Croatia sent a letter of intent for the acquisition of 16 OH-58Ds. In 2016, Croatia and Tunisia became the first nations to request the helicopters, ordering 16 and 24, respectively. Croatia received the first batch of 5 OH-58Ds at the Zadar-Zemunik air base on 30 June 2016. In early 2018, Greece was granted 70 OH-58Ds via an FMS arrangement, the type has been initially stationed at Hellenic Army Aviation air base at Stefanovikio.

In March 2020, the U.S. Army selected the Bell 360 Invictus and Sikorsky Raider X as part of the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) program to fill the capability gap left by the retirement of the OH-58. On 9 July 2020, the US Army retired its last OH-58Cs from active service at Fort Polk. In February 2024, FARA was cancelled; by this point, there were three abandoned attempts to replace the OH-58 at a cost in excess of $9 billion. The armed scout role has been filled by the AH-64 and the unarmed RQ-7 Shadow UAV; this combination reportedly accomplished 80% of the scouting mission, while also providing greater firepower, durability, and speed.

==Variants==
===OH-58A===
The &quot;OH-58A Kiowa&quot; is a four-place observation helicopter. It has two-place pilot seating, although the controls in the left seat are designed to be removed to carry a passenger up front. During its Vietnam development, it was fitted with the M134 Minigun, a 7.62 mm electrically operated machine gun.

The Australian Army leased eight OH-58As in 1971 in Vietnam for eight months. The Australian Government procured the OH-58A for the Australian Army and Royal Australian Navy as the &quot;CAC CA-32&quot;. Licensed produced in Australia by Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation, the CA-32 was the equivalent of the 206B-1 (uprated engine and longer rotor blades). The first twelve of 56 were built in the U.S. then partially disassembled and shipped to Australia, where they were reassembled. Helicopters in the naval fleet were retired in 2000.

A total of 74 OH-58As were delivered to the Canadian Armed Forces as &quot;COH-58A&quot; and later redesignated &quot;CH-136 Kiowa&quot;. As many as 12 surplus Kiowas were sold to the Dominican Republic Air Force, and others sold privately in Australia.

In 1978, OH-58As began to be converted to the same engine and dynamic components as the OH-58C. In 1992, 76 OH-58A were modified with another engine upgrade, a thermal imaging system, a communications package for law enforcement, enhanced navigational equipment and high skid gear as part of the Army National Guard&#x27;s (ARNG) Counter-Drug RAID program. The U.S. Army retired its last OH-58A in November 2017.

===OH-58B===

The &quot;OH-58B&quot; was an export version for the Austrian Air Force. Austria plans to replace the OH-58B by the end of 2030.

===OH-58C===
Equipped with a more robust engine, the &quot;OH-58C&quot; was supposed to solve issues regarding the Kiowa&#x27;s power. In addition to the improved engine, it had unique IR suppression systems mounted on its exhaust. Early OH-58Cs had flat-panel windscreens as an attempt to reduce glint from the sun, which could reveal its location to enemies. The windscreens had a negative effect of limiting the crew&#x27;s forward view, a previous strength of the original design.

The aircraft was also equipped with a larger instrument panel, roughly one–third bigger than the OH-58A panel, which held larger flight instruments. The panel was also equipped with Night Vision Goggle (NVG) compatible cockpit lighting. The OH-58C were also the first U.S. Army scout helicopter to be equipped with the AN/APR-39 radar detector, which alerted the crew to active anti-aircraft radar systems nearby. Some OH-58Cs were armed with two AIM-92 Stingers and are sometimes referred to as OH-58C/S, the &quot;S&quot; referring to the Stinger addition. Called Air-To-Air Stinger (ATAS), the weapon system was intended to provide an air defense capability.

The OH-58C was the final Kiowa variant in service with the U.S. Army, with it being used as a training aircraft. On 9 July 2020, the US Army retired the last OH-58Cs from service.

===OH-58D===
The &quot;OH-58D&quot; (Bell Model 406) was the result of the Army Helicopter Improvement Program (AHIP). An upgraded transmission and engine gave extra power, needed for nap-of-the-earth flight profiles, and a four-bladed main rotor made it quieter than the two-bladed OH-58C. The OH-58D introduced the distinctive Mast-Mounted Sight (MMS) above the main rotor, and a mixed glass cockpit with traditional instruments as &quot;standby&quot; for emergencies.

The &quot;Bell 406CS&quot; &quot;Combat Scout&quot; was based on the OH-58D (sometimes referred to as the &quot;MH-58D&quot;). Fifteen aircraft were sold to Saudi Arabia. A roof-mounted Saab HeliTOW sight system was opted for in place of the MMS. The 406CS also had detachable weapon hardpoints on each side.
The &quot;AH-58D&quot; was an OH-58D version operated by Task Force 118 (4th Squadron, 17th Cavalry) and modified with armament in support of Operation Prime Chance. The weapons and fire control systems would become the basis for the Kiowa Warrior. AH-58D is not an official DOD aircraft designation, but is used by the Army in reference to these aircraft.

The &quot;Kiowa Warrior&quot;, sometimes referred to by its acronym &quot;KW&quot;, is the armed version of the OH-58D. A key difference between the Kiowa Warrior and original AHIP aircraft is a universal weapons pylon found mounted on both sides of the fuselage, capable of carrying combinations of AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, air-to-air Stinger (ATAS) missiles, 7-shot Hydra-70 rocket pods, and an M296 0.50 in (12.7 mm) caliber machine gun. The performance standard of aerial gunnery from an OH-58D is to achieve at least one hit out of 70 shots fired at a wheeled vehicle away. The Kiowa Warrior also includes improvements in available power, navigation, communication, survivability, and deployability.

===OH-58E===
The OH-58E was one of 13 design candidates in the &quot;Advanced Scout Helicopter&quot; of 1980. The study&#x27;s conclusion was to launch the &quot;Army Helicopter Improvement Program&quot; (AHIP) in 1981 centered on the OH-58D instead.

===OH-58F===
The &quot;OH-58F&quot; is an OH-58D upgrade. The Cockpit and Sensor Upgrade Program (CASUP) adds a nose-mounted targeting and surveillance system alongside the MMS. The AAS-53 Common Sensor Payload has an infrared camera, color Electro-Optical camera, and image intensifier; via weight and drag reductions, flight performance increased by 1–2%. Cockpit upgrades include the Control and Display Subsystem version 5, more storage and processing power, three color multi-function displays, and dual-independent advanced moving maps. It has Level 2 Manned-Unmanned (L2MUM) teaming, the Force Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) display screen, and can be updated to Blue Force Tracker 2. Survivability enhancements include ballistic floor armor and the Common Missile Warning System. It has greater situational awareness, digital inter-cockpit communications, HELLFIRE future upgrades, redesigned wiring harness, Health and Usage Monitoring (HUMS), and enhanced weapons functionality via 1760 digital interface. The OH-58F is powered by a Rolls-Royce 250-C30R3 engine rated at ; it has a dual-channel, full-authority digital engine-controller that operates at required power levels in all environments. Rolls-Royce proposed engine tweaks to raise output by 12%.
In October 2012, the first OH-58F was finished. Unlike most military projects, the Army designed and built the new variant itself, which lowered development costs. It weighed , below the target weight and about lighter than the OH-58D. The weight savings are attributed to more efficient wiring and a lighter sensor. The first production aircraft began manufacturing in January 2013 and was handed over to the Army by year end. Low rate production was to start in March 2015, with the first operational squadron being fully equipped by 2016. The Army was to buy 368 OH-58Fs, with older OH-58 variants to be remanufactured. Due to battle damage and combat attrition, total OH-58F numbers would be about 321 aircraft. The OH-58F&#x27;s first flight occurred on 26 April 2013.

The Army chose to retire the Kiowa and end the CASUP upgrades. CASUP and SLEP upgrades were estimated to cost $3 billion and $7 billion respectively. The OH-58D could do 20 percent of armed aerial scout mission requirements, the OH-58F upgrade raised that to 50 percent. Replacing the Kiowa with Apaches and UAVs in scout roles met 80 percent of requirements. In early 2014, Bell received a stop-work order for the Kiowa CASUP program.

===OH-58F Block II===
On 14 April 2011, Bell performed the successful first flight of the OH-58F Block II variant. It was Bell&#x27;s entry in the Armed Aerial Scout (AAS) program. It built on the improvements of the F-model, adding features such as the Honeywell HTS900 turboshaft engine, the transmission and main rotors of the Bell 407, and the tail and tail rotor of the Bell 427. Bell started flight demonstrations in October 2012. Bell hoped for the Army to go with their service life extension models instead of the AAS program. The OH-58F is an &quot;obsolescence upgrade&quot;, while the Block II was seen as the performance upgrade. This gave the Army financial flexibility via the option of upgrading the Kiowa to the OH-58F and later continuing to the Block II when there were sufficient funds. In late 2012, the Army recommended that the AAS program proceed. The Army ended the AAS program in late 2013. In light of sequestration budget cuts in 2013, it was decided that the $16 billion cost to buy new armed scout helicopters was too great.

===Others===
The OH-58X was a modification of the fourth development OH-58D (s/n 69-16322) with partial stealth features and a chin-mounted McDonnell Douglas Electronics Systems turret as a night piloting system; including a Kodak FLIR system with a 30-degree field of view. Avionics systems were consolidated and moved to the nose, making room for a passenger seat in the rear. No aircraft were produced.

<text>Ruggero (or Ruggiero) Leoncavallo (23 April 18579 August 1919) was an Italian opera composer and librettist. Throughout his career, Leoncavallo produced numerous operas and songs but it is his 1892 opera &quot;Pagliacci&quot; that remained his lasting contribution, despite attempts to escape the shadow of his greatest success.

Today &quot;Pagliacci&quot; continues to be his most famous opera and one of the most popular and frequently performed works in the operatic repertory. His other notable compositions include the song &quot;Mattinata&quot;, popularized by Enrico Caruso, and, to a lesser extent, his version of &quot;La bohème&quot; which, however, was overshadowed by Puccini&#x27;s highly successful opera of the same name.

==Biography==
The son of Vincenzo Leoncavallo, a police magistrate and judge, Leoncavallo was born in Naples, Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, on 23 April 1857.

As a child, Leoncavallo moved with his father to the town of Montalto Uffugo in Calabria, where he lived during his adolescence. In 1868 he returned to Naples, where he eventually became a student at San Pietro a Majella Conservatory. From 1876 to 1877 he studied literature under the famed Italian poet Giosuè Carducci at the University of Bologna. He also lived in Potenza, since 1876 until 1878.

In 1879, Leoncavallo&#x27;s uncle Giuseppe, director of the press department at the Foreign Ministry in Egypt, suggested that his young nephew come to Cairo to showcase his pianistic abilities. Ruggero Leoncavallo arrived in Egypt shortly after the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II had deposed Khedive Ismail (June 1879) and replaced him as Khedive of Egypt with Ismail&#x27;s son Tewfik Pasha. Mahmud Hamdi Pasha (1863–1921), the teenage brother of the new Khedive, appointed Ruggero Leoncavallo &quot;as his private musician&quot;. His time in Egypt concluded abruptly in mid-1882, as the British intervened in the Urabi revolt of 1879–1882 in Alexandria and Cairo led by Ahmed Urabi; the composer fled and travelled to France. In Paris, Leoncavallo found lodging in Montmartre.
An agent located in the Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Denis secured Leoncavallo employment as an accompanist and instructor for artists who performed in Sunday concerts mostly at cafés. In Paris, Leoncavallo met the singer Berthe Rambaud (1869–1926) who became his &quot;preferred student&quot;; they became partners in Paris in 1888 and married in Milan in 1895. Increasingly inspired by the French romantics, particularly Alfred de Musset, Leoncavallo began work on a symphonic poem based on Musset&#x27;s poetry entitled &quot;La nuit de mai&quot;. The work was completed in Paris in 1886 and premiered in April 1887 to critical acclaim. With this success, and now with enough accumulated money, in 1888 Leoncavallo moved to Milan with Rambaud.

Back in Italy, Leoncavallo spent some years teaching and attempting ineffectively to obtain the production of more than one opera, notably &quot;Chatterton&quot;. In 1890 he saw the enormous success of Pietro Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; and wasted no time in producing his own verismo work, &quot;Pagliacci&quot;. (According to Leoncavallo, the plot of this work had a real-life origin: he claimed it derived from a murder trial in Montalto Uffugo, over which his father had presided.)

&quot;Pagliacci&quot; was performed in Milan in 1892 with immediate success; today it is the only work by Leoncavallo in the standard operatic repertory. Its most famous aria, &quot;Vesti la giubba&quot; (&quot;Put on the costume&quot; or, in the better-known older translation, &quot;On with the motley&quot;), was recorded by Enrico Caruso and laid claim to being the world&#x27;s first record to sell a million copies (although this is probably a total of Caruso&#x27;s various versions of it, made in 1902, 1904 and 1907).

The next year his &quot;I Medici&quot; was also produced in Milan, but neither it nor &quot;Chatterton&quot; (belatedly produced in 1896)—both early works—obtained much lasting favour. Much of &quot;Chatterton&quot;, however, was recorded by the Gramophone Company (later HMV) as early as 1908, and remastered on CD almost 100 years later by Marston Records. Leoncavallo himself conducts the performance or at very least supervises the production.

It was not until Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot; was performed in 1897 in Venice that his talent obtained public confirmation. However, this work was outshone by Puccini&#x27;s opera of the same name and on the same subject, which had been premiered by the Teatro Regio in Turin in February 1896. Two tenor arias from Leoncavallo&#x27;s version are still occasionally performed, especially in Italy.

Subsequent operas by Leoncavallo in the 1900s were: &quot;Zazà&quot; (the opera of Geraldine Farrar&#x27;s famous 1922 farewell performance at the Metropolitan Opera), and 1904&#x27;s &quot;Der Roland von Berlin&quot;. In 1906 the composer brought singers and orchestral musicians from La Scala to perform concerts of his music in New York, as well as making an extensive tour of the United States. The tour was, all in all, a qualified success. He had a brief success with &quot;Zingari&quot;, which premiered in Italian in London in 1912, with a long run at the Hippodrome Theatre. &quot;Zingari&quot; also reached the United States but soon disappeared from the repertoire.

After a series of operettas, Leoncavallo appeared to have tried for one last serious effort with &quot;Edipo re&quot;. It had always been assumed that Leoncavallo had finished the work but had died before he could finish the orchestration, which was completed by . However, with the publication of Konrad Dryden&#x27;s biography of Leoncavallo it was revealed that Leoncavallo may not have written the work at all (although it certainly contains themes by Leoncavallo). A review of Dryden&#x27;s study notes: &quot;That fine &quot;Edipo re&quot; ... was not even composed by [Leoncavallo]. His widow paid another composer to concoct a new opera using the music of &quot;Der Roland von Berlin&quot;. Dryden didn&#x27;t find one reference to the opera in Leoncavallo&#x27;s correspondence nor is there a single note by him to be found in the handwritten score.&quot; Pennacchio may either have concocted the opera or have had to do more to Leoncavallo&#x27;s incomplete work to &quot;fill in the gaps&quot; using Leoncavallo&#x27;s earlier music.

===Death and legacy===
Leoncavallo died in Montecatini Terme, Tuscany, on 9 August 1919. His funeral was held two days later, with hundreds in attendance, including fellow composer Pietro Mascagni and longtime rival Giacomo Puccini. He was buried in the Cimitero delle Porte Sante in Florence.

70 years after his death a campaign was launched to move the composer&#x27;s remains to Brissago, Switzerland, after an alleged letter written by Leoncavallo claimed to show he had desired to be buried there originally, although no such letter was ever found. Leoncavallo became an honorary citizen of Brissago and owned a lavish summer residence, Villa Myriam, in the town; in 1904 the composer had mentioned in a speech that he would not mind having a resting place in the town&#x27;s Madonna di Porte cemetery, but it was never a written request in his will. Regardless the campaign to move Leoncavallo&#x27;s remains moved ahead and was granted official approval by Piera Leoncavallo-Grand, the last remaining descendant of the composer; Ruggero Leoncavallo&#x27;s body was exhumed on 22 September 1989 for transfer to Switzerland. and burial there, alongside the remains of his wife Berthe (who had died in 1926).

The Museo Leoncavallo (Leoncavallo Museum) was established in 2002 in Brissago to commemorate the composer. It includes personal items and original manuscripts on display as well as statues representing characters from his operas &quot;Zazà&quot; and &quot;Der Roland von Berlin&quot;. The Museo Ruggiero Leoncavallo in the composer&#x27;s childhood home of Montalto Uffugo was opened in 2010 and also contains various manuscripts and personal items, as well as Leoncavallo&#x27;s personal piano.

Little from Leoncavallo&#x27;s other operas is heard today, but the baritone arias from &quot;Zazà&quot; were great concert and recording favourites among baritones and &quot;Zazà&quot; as a whole is sometimes revived, as is his &quot;La bohème&quot;. The tenor arias from &quot;La bohème&quot; remain recording favorites.

Leoncavallo also composed songs, most famously &quot;Mattinata&quot;, which he wrote for the Gramophone Company (which became HMV) with Caruso&#x27;s unique voice in mind. On 8 April 1904, Leoncavallo accompanied Caruso at the piano as they recorded the song. On 8 December 1905 he recorded five of his own pieces for the reproducing piano Welte-Mignon.

Leoncavallo wrote the libretti for most of his own operas; after the death in 1918 of Arrigo Boito some ranked Leoncavallo as the greatest librettist in Italy. His work for other composers included a contribution to the libretto for Puccini&#x27;s 1893 work &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;.

<text>Francesco Cilea (; 23 July 1866 – 20 November 1950) was an Italian composer. Today he is particularly known for his operas &quot;L&#x27;arlesiana&quot; and &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Palmi near Reggio di Calabria, Cilea was the son of a prominent lawyer and originally intended to follow his father into a law career. He gave an early indication of an aptitude for music when at the age of four he heard a performance of Vincenzo Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Norma&quot; and was greatly affected by it. He was sent to study music at the Conservatorio di San Pietro a Majella in Naples, where he quickly demonstrated his diligence and precocious talent, earning a gold medal from the Ministero della Pubblica Istruzione (Department of Education).

In 1889, for his final examination at the end of his course of study, he submitted his opera &quot;Gina&quot;, with a libretto by Enrico Golisciani which was adapted from the old French play &quot;Catherine, ou La Croix d&#x27;or&quot; by Baron Anne-Honoré-Joseph Duveyrier de Mélésville (1787–1865). This &quot;melodramma idilico&quot; was performed in the college theatre, and it attracted the attention of the publishers Sonzogno, who arranged for a second production, in Florence, in 1892.

Sonzogno also then commissioned from Cilea &quot;La Tilda&quot;, a verismo opera in three short acts along the lines of Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;. With a libretto by Angelo Zanardini, &quot;La Tilda&quot; had a successful first performance in April 1892 at the Teatro Pagliano in Florence, and after performances in a number of Italian theatres, it arrived at the Vienna Exhibition on 24 September 1892, alongside other works from the firm of Sonzogno. The composer never showed much sympathy for this work, the subject of which he reluctantly agreed to set to music in order to please Sonzogno and to avoid throwing away a rare professional opportunity. The loss of the orchestral score has prevented the modern revival of this work, whose fresh and catchy melodies can nevertheless be discovered in the transcription for voice and piano.

On 27 November 1897, the Teatro Lirico in Milan saw the première of Cilea&#x27;s third opera &quot;L&#x27;Arlesiana&quot;, based on the play by Alphonse Daudet, with a libretto by Leopoldo Marenco. Among the cast was the young Enrico Caruso, who performed with great success the &quot;Lamento di Federico: È la solita storia del pastore&quot;, the &quot;romance&quot; which was to keep alive the memory of the opera even to the present day. In reality &quot;L&#x27;Arlesiana&quot; was a failure which Cilea, being convinced of the work&#x27;s value, tried repeatedly to remedy, making drastic and detailed alterations throughout the remainder of his life. In the score which we hear today, it is hard to find a single bar which is completely unchanged from the original. The revised opera was however still not successful, apart from a brief period in the 1930s when it benefited from political support which the composer established through personal contact with Mussolini.

Again at the Teatro Lirico in Milan, on 6 November 1902 and again with Enrico Caruso, the composer won an enthusiastic reception for &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot;, a 4-act opera with a libretto by Arturo Colautti, set in 18th century Paris and based upon a play by Eugène Scribe. &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot; is the opera of Cilea which is best known to international audiences today, and it reveals the spontaneity of a melodic style drawn from the Neapolitan school combined with harmonic and tonal shading influenced by French composers such as Massenet.
There are a number of extant examples documenting Cilea&#x27;s modest skills as a performer. At the piano Cilea accompanied Caruso in a recording of a part of the duet &quot;Non piu nobile&quot; and made another recording with the baritone De Luca at the same time (November 1902). In 1904, for the Gramophone (and Typewriter Company), he accompanied the tenor Fernando de Lucia in &quot;L&#x27;Anima ho stanca&quot; from Adriana Lecouvreur and in the song &quot;Lontananza,&quot; an effort which critic Michael Henstock (in his biography of de Lucia) declares is hardly inspired by de Lucia&#x27;s fine performances. According to Henstock, even given the crude recording techniques of the day Cilea&#x27;s piano playing seems square and lifeless.

Cilea&#x27;s last opera, premièred at La Scala in Milan on 15 April 1907 under the baton of Arturo Toscanini, was the 3-act tragedy &quot;Gloria&quot;, again with a libretto by Colautti, based on a play by Victorien Sardou. The opera was withdrawn after only two performances; and the failure of this work, even though the composer attempted a later revision, was enough to drive him to abandon the operatic stage for good. There are however indications of some later unfulfilled operatic projects, which survive as parts or sketches of libretti, such as &quot;Il ritorno dell&#x27;amore&quot; by Renato Simoni, &quot;Malena&quot; by Ettore Moschino, and &quot;La rosa di Pompei&quot;, also by Moschino (dated &quot;Naples, 20 May 1924&quot;). Some sources also refer to an opera of 1909, completed but never performed, called &quot;Il matrimonio selvaggio&quot;, but no copy of this survives and Cilea himself made no mention of it in his volumes of memoirs (&quot;Ricordi&quot;).

Nevertheless, he continued to compose chamber music, and some orchestral music. In 1913 he produced a symphonic poem in honour of Giuseppe Verdi with verses by Sem Benelli, which was first performed at the Teatro Carlo Felice in Genoa. After this he devoted himself principally to education and became director of the Conservatorio Vincenzo Bellini in Palermo, and then at his alma mater, the Conservatorio San Pietro a Maiella in Naples, where he ended his teaching career in 1936.

In his last years Cilea&#x27;s eyesight failed but his mind was active enough to encourage and work with singers of the day. Among his last musical activities was his championship of the soprano Magda Olivero (1910–2014), whose performances in the title role of &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot; he especially admired. Cilea died in Varazze, a town near Savona in Liguria, which offered him honorary citizenship and where he spent the last years of his life. The Conservatorio di Musica and the Teatro Comunale of Reggio di Calabria were renamed in his memory, and his native town of Palmi built a mausoleum in his memory, decorated with scenes from the myth of Orpheus.

===Personal life===
Cilea married Donna Rosa Lavarello in Varazze on 26 June 1909.

<doc id="37941" wikidata="Q189491" url="?curid=37941" title="Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk">
<text>The Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk is a four-blade, twin-engine, medium-lift military utility helicopter manufactured by Sikorsky Aircraft. Sikorsky submitted a design for the United States Army&#x27;s Utility Tactical Transport Aircraft System (UTTAS) competition in 1972. The Army designated the prototype as the &quot;YUH-60A&quot; and selected the Black Hawk as the winner of the program in 1976, after a fly-off competition with the Boeing Vertol YUH-61.

Named after the Native American war leader Black Hawk, the UH-60A entered service with the U.S. Army in 1979, to replace the Bell UH-1 Iroquois as the Army&#x27;s tactical transport helicopter. This was followed by the fielding of electronic warfare and special operations variants of the Black Hawk. Improved UH-60L and UH-60M utility variants have also been developed.

Major variants include the Navy&#x27;s SH-60 Seahawk, the Air Force&#x27;s HH-60 Pave Hawk, the Coast Guard&#x27;s MH-60 Jayhawk and the civilian S-70. In addition to use by U.S. armed forces, the UH-60 family has been exported to several nations and produced under contract in Japan as the Mitsubishi H-60.

==Development==
===Initial requirement===
In the late 1960s, the United States Army began forming requirements for a helicopter to replace the UH-1 Iroquois, and designated the program as the Utility Tactical Transport Aircraft System (UTTAS). The Army also initiated the development of a new, common turbine engine for its helicopters that would become the General Electric T700. Based on experience in Vietnam, the Army required significant performance, survivability and reliability improvements from both UTTAS and the new powerplant. The Army released its UTTAS request for proposals (RFP) in January 1972. The RFP also included air transport requirements. Transport within the C-130 limited the UTTAS cabin height and length.

The UTTAS requirements for improved reliability, survivability and lower life-cycle costs resulted in features such as dual-engines with improved hot and high altitude performance, and a modular design (reduced maintenance footprint); run-dry gearboxes; ballistically tolerant, redundant subsystems (hydraulic, electrical and flight controls); crashworthy crew (armored) and troop seats; dual-stage oleo main landing gear; ballistically tolerant, crashworthy main structure; quieter, more robust main and tail rotor systems; and a ballistically tolerant, crashworthy fuel system.

Four prototypes were constructed, with the first YUH-60A flying on 17 October 1974. Prior to the delivery of the prototypes to the US Army, a preliminary evaluation was conducted in November 1975 to ensure the aircraft could be operated safely during all testing. Three of the prototypes were delivered to the Army in March 1976, for evaluation against the rival Boeing-Vertol design, the YUH-61A, and one was kept by Sikorsky for internal research. The Army selected the UH-60 for production in December 1976. Deliveries of the UH-60A to the Army began in October 1978 and the helicopter entered service in June 1979.

===Upgrades and variations===

After entering service, the helicopter was modified for new missions and roles, including mine laying and medical evacuation. An EH-60 variant was developed to conduct electronic warfare and special operations aviation developed the MH-60 variant to support its missions.

Due to weight increases from the addition of mission equipment and other changes, the Army ordered the improved UH-60L in 1987. The new model incorporated all of the modifications made to the UH-60A fleet as standard design features. The UH-60L also featured more power and lifting capability with upgraded T700-GE-701C engines and an improved gearbox, both from the SH-60B Seahawk. Its external lift capacity increased by up to . The UH-60L also incorporated the SH-60B&#x27;s automatic flight control system (AFCS) for better flight control with more powerful engines. Production of the L-model began in 1989.
Development of the next improved variant, the UH-60M, was approved in 2001, to extend the service life of the UH-60 design into the 2020s. The UH-60M incorporates upgraded T700-GE-701D engines, improved rotor blades, and state-of-the-art electronic instrumentation, flight controls and aircraft navigation control. After the U.S. DoD approved low-rate initial production of the new variant, manufacturing began in 2006, with the first of 22 new UH-60Ms delivered in July 2006. After an initial operational evaluation, the Army approved full-rate production and a five-year contract for 1,227 helicopters in December 2007. By March 2009, 100 UH-60M helicopters had been delivered to the Army. In November 2014, the US military ordered 102 aircraft of various H-60 types, worth $1.3 billion.

Following their use in the operation to kill Osama bin Laden in May 2011, it emerged that the 160th SOAR used a secret version of the UH-60 modified with low-observable technology which enabled it to evade Pakistani radar. Analysis of the tail section, the only remaining part of the aircraft which crashed during the operation, revealed extra blades on the tail rotor and other noise reduction measures, making the craft much quieter than conventional UH-60s. The aircraft appeared to include features like special high-tech materials, harsh angles, and flat surfaces found only in stealth jets. Low observable versions of the Black Hawk have been studied as far back as the mid-1970s.

In September 2012, Sikorsky was awarded a Combat Tempered Platform Demonstration (CTPD) contract to further improve the Black Hawk&#x27;s durability and survivability. The company is to develop new technologies such as a zero-vibration system, adaptive flight control laws, advanced fire management, a more durable main rotor, full-spectrum crashworthiness, and damage-tolerant airframe; then they are to transition them to the helicopter. Improvements to the Black Hawk are to continue until the Future Vertical Lift program is ready to replace it.

In December 2014, the 101st Airborne Division began testing new resupply equipment called the Enhanced Speed Bag System (ESBS). Soldiers in the field requiring quick resupply have depended on speed bags filled with items airdropped from a UH-60. However, all systems were ad hoc with bags not made to keep objects secure from impacts, so up to half of the airdropped items would be damaged upon hitting the ground. Started in 2011, the ESBS sought to standardize the airdrop resupply method and keep up to 90 percent of supplies intact. The system includes a hands-free reusable linear brake and expendable speed line and a multipurpose cargo bag. When the bag is deployed, the brake applies friction to the rope, slowing it down enough to keep the bag oriented down on the padded base, a honeycomb and foam kit inside to dissipate energy.

The ESBS better protects helicopter-dropped supplies, and allows the Black Hawk to fly higher above the ground, up from 10 feet, while travelling , limiting exposure to ground fire. Each bag can weigh and up to six can be deployed at once, dropping at . Since supplies can be delivered more accurately and the system can be automatically released on its own, the ESBS can enable autonomous resupply from unmanned helicopters.

==Design==
The UH-60 features four-blade main and tail rotors, and is powered by two General Electric T700 turboshaft engines. The main rotor is fully articulated and has elastomeric bearings in the rotor head. The tail rotor is canted and features a rigid crossbeam. The helicopter has a long, low profile shape to meet the Army&#x27;s requirement for transporting aboard a C-130 Hercules, with some disassembly. It can carry 11 troops with equipment, lift of cargo internally or of cargo (for UH-60L/M) externally by sling.

The Black Hawk helicopter series can perform a wide array of missions, including the tactical transport of troops, electronic warfare, and aeromedical evacuation. A VIP version known as the VH-60N is used to transport important government officials (e.g., Congress, Executive departments) with the helicopter&#x27;s call sign of &quot;Marine One&quot; when transporting the President of the United States. In air assault operations, it can move a squad of 11 combat troops or reposition a 105 mm M119 howitzer with 30 rounds ammunition and a four-man crew in a single lift. The Black Hawk is equipped with advanced avionics and electronics for increased survivability and capability, such as the Global Positioning System.
The UH-60 can be equipped with stub wings at the top of the fuselage to carry fuel tanks or various armaments. The initial stub wing system is called External Stores Support System (ESSS). It has two pylons on each wing to carry two and two tanks in total. The four fuel tanks and associated lines and valves form the external extended range fuel system (ERFS). U.S. Army UH-60s have had their ESSS modified into the crashworthy external fuel system (CEFS) configuration, replacing the older tanks with up to four total crashworthy tanks along with self-sealing fuel lines. The ESSS can also carry of armament such as rockets, missiles and gun pods. The ESSS entered service in 1986. However, it was found that the four fuel tanks obstruct the field of fire for the door guns; thus, the external tank system (ETS), carrying two fuel tanks on the stub wings, was developed.

The unit cost of the H-60 models varies due to differences in specifications, equipment and quantities. For example, the unit cost of the Army&#x27;s UH-60L Black Hawk is $5.9 million while the Air Force HH-60G Pave Hawk has a unit cost of $10.2 million.

==Operational history==
The UH-60 Black Hawk is in service with 35 countries as of 2024.

===Australia===
Australia bought early model UH-60 in the 1980s, and is buying a fleet of newer versions ones in the 2020s:
Australia ordered fourteen S-70A-9 Black Hawks in 1986 and an additional twenty-five Black Hawks in 1987. The first US-produced Black Hawk was delivered in 1987 to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). de Havilland Australia produced thirty-eight Black Hawks under license from Sikorsky in Australia delivering the first in 1988 and the last in 1991. In 1989, the RAAF&#x27;s fleet of Black Hawks was transferred to the Australian Army. The Black Hawks saw operational service in Cambodia, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, East Timor and Pakistan.

In April 2009, the then-defence chief Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, told the government not to deploy Black Hawks to Afghanistan as at the time they &quot;lacked armor and self-defense systems&quot;, and despite an upgrade to address this underway, it was more practical to use allies&#x27; helicopters. In 2004, the government selected the Multi-Role Helicopter (MRH-90) Taipan, a variant of the NHIndustries NH90, to replace the Black Hawk even though the Department of Defence had recommended the S‐70M Black Hawk.

In January 2014, the Army began retiring the fleet of 34 Black Hawks from service (five had been lost in accidents) and had planned for this to be completed by June 2018. The Chief of Army delayed the retirement of 20 Black Hawks until 2021 to enable the Army to develop a special operations role capable MRH-90. On 10 December 2021, the S-70A-9 Black Hawks were retired from service. On the same day, amid issues with the performance of the MRH-90s the government announced that they would be replaced by UH-60M Black Hawks. In January 2023, the Army announced the acquisition of 40 UH-60Ms with deliveries commencing in 2023.

===Brazil===
Brazil received four UH-60L helicopters in 1997, for the Brazilian Army peacekeeping forces. It received six UH-60Ls configured for special forces, and search and rescue uses in 2008. It ordered ten more UH-60Ls in 2009; deliveries began in March 2011. In July 2024, the MoD authorized the purchase of 12 additional UH-60Ms, in a US$451 million plan.

===China===
In December 1983, examples of the Aerospatiale AS-332 Super Puma, Bell 214ST SuperTransport and Sikorsky S-70A-5 (N3124B) were airlifted to Lhasa for testing. These demonstrations included take-offs and landings at altitudes to and &quot;en route&quot; operations to . At the end of this testing, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army purchased 24 S-70C-2s, equipped with more powerful GE T700-701A engines for improved high-altitude performance. While designated as civil variants of the S-70 for export purposes, they are operated by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Aviation units.

===Colombia===

Colombia first received UH-60s from the U.S. in 1987. The Colombian National Police, Colombian Aerospace Force, and Colombian Army use UH-60s to transport troops and supplies to places which are difficult to access by land for counter-insurgency (COIN) operations against drug and guerrilla organizations, for search and rescue, and for medical evacuation. Colombia also operates a militarized gunship version of the UH-60, with stub wings, locally known as &quot;Arpía&quot; ().

The Colombian Army became the first worldwide operator of the S-70i with Terrain Awareness and Warning Capability (HTAWS) after taking delivery of the first two units on 13 August 2013.

===Israel===
The Israeli Air Force (IAF) received 10 surplus UH-60A Black Hawks from the U.S. in August 1994. Named &quot;Yanshuf&quot; () by the IAF, the UH-60A began replacing Bell 212 utility helicopters. The IAF first used the UH-60s in combat during 1996 in southern Lebanon in Operation Grapes of Wrath against Hezbollah.

===Mexico===
The Mexican Air Force ordered its first two UH-60Ls in 1991 to transport special forces units, and another four in 1994. In July and August 2009, the Federal Police used UH-60s in attacks on drug traffickers. In August 2011, the Mexican Navy received three upgraded and navalized UH-60M. On 21 April 2014, the U.S. State Department approved the sale of 18 UH-60Ms to Mexico pending approval from Congress. In September 2014, Sikorsky received a $203.6 million (~$ in ) firm-fixed-price contract modification for the 18 UH-60s designated for the Mexican Air Force.

===Philippines===

2 S-70-A5 VIP helicopters purchased 1983 and was delivered in 1984, this Blackhawk served the 250th PAW for more than 3 decades as a Presidential VVIP transport helicopter. Only 1 remains in service with the 505th Search and Rescue Group.

In March 2019, the Philippines&#x27; Department of National Defense (DND) signed a contract worth US$241.4 million (~$ in ) with Lockheed Martin&#x27;s Polish subsidiary PZL Mielec for 16 Sikorsky S-70i Black Hawks to the PAF. On 10 December 2020, the PAF commissioned their first batch of six S-70i Blackhawks, with the remaining 10 to be delivered in 2021. In June 2021, the air service received a second batch of five helicopters. In November 2021, the third batch of five arrived.

On 22 February 2022, DND and PZL Mielec formally signed the US$624 million contract for 32 additional S-70i Black Hawks, totalling to around 48 units ordered. This will make the Philippine Air Force the largest user of S-70i Blackhawk Helicopters globally.

===Poland===
In January 2019, Poland ordered four S-70i Black Hawks with four delivered to the Polish Special Forces in December of that same year. Another four S-70i helicopters are on order with two scheduled for delivery in 2023 and two in 2024. In July 2023, Poland launched a procurement tender for S-70i Black Hawks with a goal to order approximately 32 helicopters.

===Slovakia===
In February 2015, the U.S. State Department approved a possible Foreign Military Sale of nine UH-60Ms with associated equipment and support to Slovakia and sent it to Congress for its approval. In April 2015, Slovakia&#x27;s government approved the procurement of nine UH-60Ms along with training and support. In September 2015, Slovakia ordered four UH-60Ms. The first two UH-60Ms were delivered in June 2017; the Slovak Air Force had received all nine UH-60Ms by January 2020. These are to replace its old Soviet Mil Mi-17s. In 2020, the Slovak minister of defense announced Slovakia&#x27;s interest in buying two more UH-60Ms.

Slovak Training Academy (European Air Services / Heli Company) from Košice, a private company, operates some older UH-60As &amp; Bs for pilot training, aerial fire fighting and sky crane operations.

===Sweden===
Sweden requested 15 UH-60M helicopters by Foreign Military Sale in September 2010. The UH-60Ms were ordered in May 2011, and deliveries began in January 2012. In March 2013, Swedish ISAF forces began using Black Hawks in Afghanistan for MEDEVAC purposes. The UH-60Ms have been fully operational since 2017. Sweden designates it the Helicopter 16 (Hkp 16). In June 2024, Sweden ordered 12 more UH-60Ms from the US.

===South Korea===
The Republic of Korea Armed Forces is also an operator and has produced about 130 aircraft under license from Korean Air since the 1990s and domestically producing and introducing the UH-60 simulator. However, the cockpit is analog compared to the digital one in the United States, but since this business started after the 1988 Olympics, there was no such thing as a glass cockpit with an LCD monitor. Currently, the majority of South Korea&#x27;s UH-60s belong to the Army, including more than 30 units operated by the Special Operations Aviation Corps.

===Taiwan===
Taiwan (Republic of China) operated S-70C-1/1A after the Republic of China Air Force received ten S-70C-1A and four S-70C-1 Bluehawk helicopters in June 1986 for Search and Rescue. Four more S-70C-6s were received in April 1998. The ROC Navy received the first of ten S-70C(M)-1s in July 1990. 11 S-70C(M)-2s were received beginning April 2000. In January 2010, the US announced approval for a Foreign Military Sale of 60 UH-60Ms to Taiwan with 30 designated for the Army, 15 for the National Airborne Service Corps (including the one that crashed off Orchid Island in 2018) and 15 for the Air Force Rescue Group (including the one that crashed 2 January 2020).

===Turkey===
Turkey has operated the UH-60 during NATO deployments to Afghanistan and the Balkans. The UH-60 has also been used in counter-terror/internal security operations.

The Black Hawk competed against the AgustaWestland AW149 in the Turkish General Use Helicopter Tender, to order up to 115 helicopters and produce many of them indigenously, with Turkish Aerospace Industries responsible for final integration and assembly. On 21 April 2011, Turkey announced the selection of Sikorsky&#x27;s T-70.

In the course of the coup d&#x27;état attempt in Turkey on 15 July 2016, eight Turkish military personnel of various ranks landed in Greece&#x27;s northeastern city of Alexandroupolis on board a Black Hawk helicopter and claimed political asylum in Greece. The helicopter was returned to Turkey shortly thereafter.

===Ukraine===

In February 2023, Ukraine&#x27;s Main Directorate of Intelligence (HUR) published a video showing them operating at least two UH-60s painted in Ukrainian colors. The helicopters appeared to have minimal modifications, namely the addition of two M240 7.62 mm machine guns for defensive purposes. It was confirmed that at least one of these was purchased by a third party, Ace Aeronautics, following a Czech crowdfunding effort that raised US$6 million. On 17 March 2024, Russia claimed to have shot down a UH-60 during the March 2024 western Russia incursion, claiming it was a &quot;troop transport&quot; carrying 20 troops into combat. However, it was revealed to be a Mil Mi-8 instead.

===United States===

The UH-60 entered service with the U.S. Army&#x27;s 101st Combat Aviation Brigade of the 101st Airborne Division in June 1979. The U.S. military first used the UH-60 in combat during the invasion of Grenada in 1983, and again in the invasion of Panama in 1989. During the Gulf War in 1991, the UH-60 participated in the largest air assault mission in U.S. Army history with over 300 helicopters involved. Two UH-60s (89-26214 and 78–23015) were shot down, both on 27 February 1991, while performing Combat Search and Rescue of other downed aircrews, an F-16C pilot and the crew of a MEDEVAC UH-1H that were shot down earlier that day.

In 1993, Black Hawks featured prominently in the Battle of Mogadishu in Somalia during which two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down. Black Hawks also saw action in the Balkans and Haiti in the 1990s. U.S. Army UH-60s and other helicopters conducted many air assaults and other support missions during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The UH-60 has continued to serve in operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.
Customs and Border Protection Office of Air and Marine (OAM) uses the UH-60 in its operations specifically along the southwest border. The Black Hawk has been used by OAM to interdict illegal entry into the U.S. Additionally, OAM regularly uses the UH-60 in search and rescue operations. Highly modified H-60s were employed during the U.S. Special Operations mission that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden during Operation Neptune Spear on 1 May 2011. One such MH-60 helicopter crash-landed during the operation and was destroyed by the team before it departed in the other MH-60 and a backup MH-47 Chinook with bin Laden&#x27;s remains. Two MH-47s were used for the mission to refuel the two MH-60s and as backups. News media reported that the Pakistani government granted the Chinese military access to the wreckage of the crashed &#x27;stealth&#x27; UH-60 variant in Abbottabad; Pakistan and China denied the reports, and the U.S. government did not confirm Chinese access.

The U.S. Army has signalled its intent to eventually replace the UH-60, launching the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) program in 2019, with a new helicopter planned to enter service by 2030. Bell and a joint Sikorsky-Boeing team both entered competing designs. In December 2022 it was announced that the winning design was Bell’s tilt-rotor V-280 Valor, with the US Army awarding an initial contract to develop a prototype by 2025. This award does not guarantee the eventual adoption of the V-280, which would require further contracts. As an Army program, the outcome of FLRAA will not necessarily affect UH-60 variants in service with other branches of the U.S. military.

===Additional users===
The United Arab Emirates requested 14 UH-60M helicopters and associated equipment in September 2008, through Foreign Military Sale. It had received 20 UH-60Ls by November 2010. Bahrain ordered nine UH-60Ms in 2007.

The remaining sum is be provided by Croatia&#x27;s Ministry of Defence in the three-year budget period from 2025 to 2027. The Letter of Offer and Acceptance was signed in March 2024. Delivery of all 8 Black Hawks is expected in 2028.

Tunisia requested 12 armed UH-60M helicopters in July 2014 through Foreign Military Sale. In August 2014, the U.S. ambassador stated that the U.S. &quot;will soon make available&quot; the UH-60Ms to Tunisia. The sale of 8 helicopters was approved and helicopters were delivered 2017 and 2018.

In January 2015, the Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein confirmed that Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) is receiving S-70A Blackhawks from the Brunei government. These helicopters, believed to be four in total, were expected to be transferred to Malaysia by September with M134D miniguns added. The four Blackhawks were delivered to Royal Brunei Air Force (RBAirF / TUDB) in 1999.

In 2018, Latvia requested to buy four UH-60M Black Hawks with associated equipment for an estimated cost of $200 million (~$ in ). In August 2018, the State Department approved the possible Foreign Military Sale. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency delivered the required certification notifying Congress of the possible sale. In November 2018, Latvia ordered four UH-60Ms, and received the first two in December 2022.

In 2019, Lithuania announced plans to buy six UH-60M helicopters before ordering four UH-60Ms in 2020. In July 2020, the US State Department approved the possible Foreign Military Sale of six UH-60Ms and associated equipment to Lithuania for $380 million. In November 2020, Lithuania signed a contract worth $213 million for four UH-60Ms with an option to purchase two more aircraft. Preparations are almost complete including facilities and training, with deliveries expected in late 2024.

In 2019, Poland ordered four S-70i helicopters for its special forces. As of 2023 there is negotiations to purchase additional S-70i helicopters.

In August 2023, the Portuguese Air Force shared a photo on twitter of the first flight of one of the six UH-60s purchased from Arista Aviation Services. The Portuguese armed forces conducted its first operation flight of its UH-60 in December 2023.

In December 2023, the Hellenic Army selected the UH-60Ms for a possible order of 35 aircraft and associated equipment for an estimated cost of $1.95 billion pending the deal clears Congress. This order was approved by US and Greek governments, and a contract for 35 helicopters agreed by April 2024. In Greek service it will replace aged Bell UH-1H and Agusta-Bell AB205. Greece already operates S-70B and MH-60R helicopters.

===Future and potential users===
In February 2013, the Indonesian Army announced its interest in buying UH-60 Black Hawks to modernize its weaponry. The army wants them for combating terrorism, transnational crime, and insurgency to secure the archipelago. In August 2023, Indonesian Aerospace and Lockheed Martin signed an agreement for the procurement of 24 UH-60/S-70 Blackhawks.

In 2022, the Royal Air Force and British Army expects to select a helicopter for the New Medium Helicopter program to replace several existing helicopters. Sikorsky has indicated it expects its S-70M to meet the requirement to participate in this procurement selection program.

All special operations Black Hawks to be modernized to MH-60M standard by 2015. Like the K-model, the MH-60M can be configured either as an assault helicopter carrying troops or as a DAP gunship.
* MH-60 Black Hawk stealth helicopter: One of two (known) specially modified MH-60s used in the raid on Osama bin Laden&#x27;s compound in Pakistan on 1 May 2011 was damaged in a hard landing, and was subsequently destroyed by U.S. forces. Subsequent reports state that the Black Hawk destroyed was a previously unconfirmed but rumored, modification of the design with reduced noise signature and stealth technology. The modifications are said to add several hundred pounds to the base helicopter including edge alignment panels, special coatings and anti-radar treatments for the windshields.
* UH-60A RASCAL: NASA-modified version for the Rotorcraft-Aircrew Systems Concepts Airborne Laboratory; a US$25M program for the study of helicopter manoeuvrability in three programs, Superaugmented Controls for Agile Maneuvering Performance (SCAMP), Automated Nap-of-the-Earth (ANOE) and Rotorcraft Agility and Pilotage Improvement Demonstration (RAPID). The UH-60A RASCAL performed a fully autonomous flight on 5 November 2012. U.S. Army personnel were on board, but the flying was done by helicopter. During a two-hour flight, the Black Hawk featured terrain sensing, trajectory generation, threat avoidance, and autonomous flight control. It was fitted with a 3D-LZ laser detection and ranging (LADAR) system. The autonomous flight was performed between 200 and 400 feet. Upon landing, the onboard technology was able to pinpoint a safe landing zone, hover, and safely bring itself down.
* OPBH: On 11 March 2014, Sikorsky successfully conducted the first flight demonstration of their Optionally Piloted Black Hawk (OPBH), a milestone part of the company&#x27;s Manned/Unmanned Resupply Aerial Lifter (MURAL) program to provide autonomous cargo delivery for the U.S. Army. The helicopter used the company&#x27;s Matrix technology (software to improve features of autonomous, optionally-piloted VTOL aircraft) to perform autonomous hover and flight operations under the control of an operator using a man-portable Ground Control Station (GCS). The MURAL program is a cooperative effort between Sikorsky, the US Army Aviation Development Directorate (ADD), and the US Army Utility Helicopters Project Office (UH PO). The purpose of creating an optionally-manned Black Hawk is to make the aircraft autonomously carry out resupply missions and expeditionary operations while increasing sorties and maintaining crew rest requirements and leaving pilots to focus more on sensitive operations.

====VIP====
* VH-60D Night Hawk: VIP-configured HH-60D, used for presidential transport by USMC. T700-GE-401C engines. Variant was later redesignated VH-60N.
* VH-60N White Hawk &quot;White Top&quot;: Modified UH-60A with some features from the SH-60B/F Seahawks. Is one of the VIP-configured USMC helicopter models that perform Presidential and VIP transport as Marine One. The VH-60N entered service in 1988 and nine helicopters were delivered.

* VH-60M Black Hawk &quot;Gold Top&quot;: Heavily modified UH-60M used for executive transport. Members of the Joint Chiefs, Congressional leadership, and other DoD personnel are flown on these exclusively by Alpha company, 12th Aviation Battalion at Fort Belvoir, Virginia.

==Accidents==

* From 1981 to 1987, five Black Hawks crashed (killing or injuring all on board) while flying near radio broadcast towers because their electromagnetic emissions disrupted the helicopters&#x27; flight control systems. The Black Hawk helicopters were not hardened against high-intensity radiated fields, contrary to the SH-60 Seahawk Navy version. The pilots were instructed to fly away from emitters, and, in the long term, shielding was increased and backup systems were installed.
* On 29 July 1992, one Australian Army Black Hawk collided into terrain near Oakey Army Aviation Centre, killing two occupants.
* On 3 March 1994, a UH-60 helicopter of the 15th Fighter Wing, Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) exploded above Yongin, Gyeonggi-do, killing all six personnel on board; among those killed was General Cho Kun-hae, then Chief of the Air Staff of South Korea.
* On 14 April 1994, two U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawks in northern Iraq were shot down in a friendly fire incident by U.S. Air Force F-15 fighter jets patrolling the northern no-fly zone that had been imposed after the 1991 Gulf War, in which all twenty-six crew and passengers were killed.

<text>Domenico Cimarosa (; 17 December 1749 – 11 January 1801) was an Italian composer of the Neapolitan School and of the Classical period. He wrote more than eighty operas, the best known of which is &quot;Il matrimonio segreto&quot; (1792); most of his operas are comedies. He also wrote instrumental works and church music.

Cimarosa was principally based in Naples, but spent some of his career in various other parts of Italy, composing for the opera houses of Rome, Venice, Florence and elsewhere. He was engaged by Catherine the Great of Russia as her court composer and conductor between 1787 and 1791. In his later years, returning to Naples, he backed the losing side in the struggle to overthrow the monarchy there, and was imprisoned and then exiled. He died in Venice at the age of 51.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Cimarosa was born in Aversa, a town near Naples. His family name was Cimmarosa, which is how he is recorded on his baptismal record. He appears to have been an only child. His father, Gennaro, was a stonemason, and within days of Domenico&#x27;s birth the family moved to Naples where Gennaro found employment on the construction of the Palace of Capodimonte. When Domenico was seven, Gennaro fell from scaffolding and was killed. His widow, Anna, was taken on as a laundress by the monastic order of the Church of San Severo, and Cimarosa received a good education—including musical training—from the monks and clergy of the church. The organist of the monastery, Padre Polcano, took a particular interest in his education and Cimarosa progressed so well in his musical studies that he was admitted to Naples&#x27;s leading college of music, the Conservatorio di S Maria di Loreto, in 1761, when he was twelve. His teachers were Gennaro Manna and Fedele Fenaroli for composition and Saverio Carcais, the &quot;maestro de violino&quot;. He was a capable keyboard player, violinist and singer, but composition was his primary concern as a student; in 1770 he, Niccolò Antonio Zingarelli and Giuseppe Giordani were senior students in the composition class.

As a student, Cimarosa wrote sacred motets and masses, but he first came to public notice with the premiere in 1772 of his first &quot;commedia per musica&quot;, &quot;Le stravaganze del conte&quot;, performed at the Teatro dei Fiorentini in Naples. The work met with approval, and was followed in the same year by &quot;Le pazzie di Stelladaura e di Zoroastro&quot;. This work was also successful, and the fame of the young composer began to spread all over Italy. In 1774, he was invited to Rome to write an opera for the &quot;stagione&quot; of that year; and there he produced another comic opera called &quot;L&#x27;italiana in Londra&quot;. In 1777 he married Constanza Suffi, who died the following year.

===Successful composer===

In the 1770s and 1780s Cimarosa wrote numerous operas for the theatres of Italy. He was best known for his comedies, but wrote serious works from time to time, including &quot;Caio Mario&quot; (1780) and &quot;Alessandro nell&#x27;Indie&quot; (1781). As well as stage works he wrote church music. He was appointed supernumerary organist of the Neapolitan royal court in November 1779, and by the early 1780s he was a visiting maestro at the Ospedaletto di Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice.

For Rome, he composed operas for three different theatres in the late 1780s and early 1780s; these works included &quot;Il ritorno di Don Calandrino&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;italiana in Londra&quot;, &quot;Le donne rivali&quot;, &quot;Il pittore parigino&quot; and for La Scala, Milan, following the success there of a revival of &quot;L&#x27;impresario in angustie&quot;, he composed &quot;La Circe&quot;, a &quot;dramma per musica&quot; in three acts, with a story loosely based on the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. At some point in the 1780s Cimarosa married for the second time; his wife, Gaetana, &quot;née&quot; Pallante, was Constanza&#x27;s step-sister; she and Cimarosa had two sons. She died in 1796.

In 1787, Cimarosa went to Saint Petersburg at the invitation of Empress Catherine II. He was one of a succession of Italian composers engaged by the Russian court over the years; others were Vincenzo Manfredini (from 1762 to 1769), Baldassare Galuppi (1765–1768), Tommaso Traetta (1768–1775), Giovanni Paisiello (1776–1784), and Giuseppe Sarti (1785–1801). He composed a serious opera, &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, and revised two of his existing comic pieces &quot;Le donne rivali&quot; and &quot;I due baroni di Rocca Azzurra&quot;. Other compositions for Catherine&#x27;s court included a Requiem, in G minor (1787). Cimarosa was less successful in Saint Petersburg than some of his compatriots; the works of his subordinate, Martin y Soler, gained more favour with the empress, and this, combined with economies that meant losing most of the Italian singers, and Cimarosa&#x27;s dislike of the severe Russian winters, led him to leave Russia in June 1791.

After spending three months in Warsaw, Cimarosa arrived in Vienna. His music was already popular there, and the emperor, Leopold II, appointed him Kapellmeister to the court, and commissioned a new opera. The result was &quot;Il matrimonio segreto&quot;, to a text by Giovanni Bertati, based on the 1766 play, &quot;The Clandestine Marriage&quot;, by George Colman the Elder and David Garrick. The opera, performed at the Burgtheater on 7 February 1792, was so successful that Leopold had it played again the same evening in his private chambers – &quot;the longest encore in operatic history&quot; as one critic put it. Cimarosa did not consider the work his best, but it has a better libretto than some of his other comic operas, the plot clear, the characters well drawn and elaborate disguises and coincidences dispensed with. The composer&#x27;s own favourite of his operas was &quot;Artemisia, regina di Caria&quot;, a serious work, composed for Naples five years later.

===Later years===
Cimarosa&#x27;s success was international. He was, together with Paisiello, the most popular opera composer in the late 18th century. He composed 60 opere buffe and 20 opere serie, many of which quickly entered the repertoire of opera houses throughout Europe. They were performed in Berlin, Copenhagen, Hamburg, London, Prague and Stockholm, as well as Saint Petersburg, Vienna and all the main Italian cities. Between 1783 and 1790 Haydn conducted performances of thirteen Cimarosa operas for his employers at Schloss Esterházy and many of the pieces were given several times. Cimarosa&#x27;s &quot;La ballerina amante&quot;, a &quot;commedia per musica&quot; first performed in Naples was chosen as the inaugural work at the Teatro Nacional de São Carlos, Lisbon, in June 1793.

Three weeks after the premiere of &quot;Il matrimonio segreto&quot; the emperor Leopold died suddenly. His successor, Francis II, was less interested in music than Leopold had been, and in 1793, Cimarosa returned to Naples. In 1796 he was appointed principal organist of the royal chapel, and he continued to produce new operas and revise older ones. He reworked &quot;L&#x27;italiana in Londra&quot; and &quot;I due baroni&quot;, adapting them for local taste by adding sections in Neapolitan dialect. The most important new works from this last phase of his career were &quot;Le astuzie femminili&quot; (1794) and two serious operas,&quot; Penelope&quot; (1794) and &quot;Gli Orazi e i Curiazi&quot; (1796); the first two of these were composed for Naples, and the last for La Fenice in Venice.
During the occupation of Naples by the troops of the French Republic, in 1799 Cimarosa joined the liberal party, but the monarchy was soon restored, and took strong measures against those with liberal or revolutionary connections. Cimarosa was imprisoned along with many of his political friends, and escaped the death sentence only through the intercession of influential admirers, including Cardinals Consalvi and Ruffo and Lady Hamilton. He was exiled from Naples, and went to Venice. He was terminally ill by this time, probably with stomach cancer, and he died on 11 January 1801, aged 51, composing until almost the end. His last opera, &quot;Artemisia&quot; was left unfinished. A rumour spread that he had been poisoned by agents of the Bourbons, but an inquest showed it to be unfounded.

==Works==

Although Cimarosa wrote a considerable quantity of instrumental and church music, he was, and remains, best known for his operas. He was famous for his facility as a composer, although he frequently reused material, as was usual in his day, and employed assistants for routine tasks such as composing recitatives. In the article on Cimarosa in &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; (2001), Jennifer E. Johnson and Gordana Lazarevich write that he rose above the mediocrity of some the librettos he set and produced music &quot;suffused with lightness, elegance and finesse&quot;.

Cimarosa avoided the rigidity of the traditional da capo aria, and wrote solo numbers consisting of more flexible divisions, with changes of tempo, metre and key to reflect the words of his librettists. Johnson and Lazarevich comment that this freedom of form conveys spontaneity and flexibility. Cimarosa&#x27;s arias often speed up for the closing section, in the style of cabalettas. Providing contrast to the vocal display pieces, he often wrote quite simple arias in the manner of cavatinas. A feature of his scores is the sustained writing for concerted voices. In the words of the &quot;Grove&quot; article:

Harmonically, Cimarosa was not innovative, remaining content with traditional diatonic conventions. In the view of Johnson and Lazarevich his musical strengths are to be found in &quot;the richness of his melodic invention, the brilliance and energy of his rhythmic and melodic motifs and his constantly lively accompaniments&quot;.

Cimarosa&#x27;s approach to orchestration developed over his career. His earlier works are generally written for strings, oboes, horns and trumpets, and occasionally bassoons and flutes. In these pieces the function of the orchestra is to provide discreet support for the voices. During his four years in Saint Petersburg, he began to use clarinets, and to orchestrate more fully and richly. Johnson and Lazarevich instance &quot;Il matrimonio segreto&quot;, in which a large orchestra &quot;provides colour and exhibits independent motivic and rhythmic material that serves as commentary on the action&quot;.

Cimarosa wrote a number of piano sonatas, which were discovered in manuscript in the 1920s; the quantity has been asserted as over 80 single-movement works, but it is thought that many of these may in fact belong with each other as three-movement works. The work sometimes referred to as Cimarosa&#x27;s &quot;Concerto for oboe&quot; is in fact a 1949 confection by Arthur Benjamin, consisting of arrangements of movements from the sonatas.

==Reputation==
Johnson and Lazarevich write that Cimarosa&#x27;s reputation during his lifetime reached a height unsurpassed until Rossini&#x27;s heyday, and he continued to be highly regarded into the 19th century. Eugène Delacroix preferred Cimarosa&#x27;s music to Mozart&#x27;s. He wrote of &quot;Il matrimonio segreto&quot;, &quot;It is perfection itself. No other musician has this symmetry, this expressiveness and sense of the appropriate, this gaiety and tenderness, and above all … incomparable elegance&quot;. Stendhal wrote that Cimarosa, Mozart and Shakespeare were the only passions of his life. To Stendhal, Cimarosa was &quot;the Molière of composers&quot;, and he claimed to have seen &quot;Il matrimonio segreto&quot; more than 100 times.

Hector Berlioz, who hated Italian opera, was not an admirer: &quot;I should throw to the devil the unique and interminable &quot;Matrimonio Segreto&quot;, which is nearly as tiresome as &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; without being anything like so musical.&quot; Robert Schumann was impressed by Cimarosa&#x27;s &quot;absolutely masterful&quot; orchestration, but by little else. Eduard Hanslick praised Cimarosa&#x27;s wonderful facility, masterly compositional strokes and good taste. &quot;Full of sunshine – that is the right expression for Cimarosa&#x27;s music&quot;.

<doc id="37944" wikidata="Q357022" url="?curid=37944" title="Giovanni Pacini">
<text>Giovanni Pacini (11 February 17966 December 1867) was an Italian composer, best known for his operas. Pacini was born in Catania, Sicily, the son of the buffo Luigi Pacini, who was to appear in the premieres of many of Giovanni&#x27;s operas. The family was of Tuscan origin, living in Catania when the composer was born. He served as the Florence Conservatory&#x27;s first director from 1849 through 1862.

His first 25 or so operas were written when Gioachino Rossini dominated the Italian operatic stage. But Pacini&#x27;s operas were &quot;rather superficial&quot;, a fact which, later, he candidly admitted in his &quot;Memoirs&quot;. For some years he held the post of &quot;director of the Teatro San Carlo in Naples.&quot; Later, retiring to Viareggio to found a school of music, Pacini took time to assess the state of opera in Italy and, during a five-year period during which he stopped composing, laid out his ideas in his Memoirs. Like Saverio Mercadante, who also reassessed the strength and weaknesses of this period in opera, Pacini&#x27;s style did change, but he quickly became eclipsed by the rising influence of Giuseppe Verdi on the Italian operatic scene, and many of his operas appeared to be old fashioned and rarely, if ever, appeared outside of Italy.&quot; Pacini&#x27;s work is largely forgotten today, although some recordings do exist.

==Career as composer==
During his lifetime, Pacini wrote some 74 operas. This is less than earlier estimates, which ranged from 80 to 90, since it has now been ascertained that many were just alternate titles for other works. It has been noted that he &quot;bothered little about harmony and instrumentation&quot;, a fact supported by Rossini who once said: &quot;God help us if he knew music. No one could resist him&quot;. Certainly, Pacini recognized Rossini&#x27;s strengths and his dominance during this period: &quot;Everyone followed the same school, the same fashions, and as a result they were all imitators of the great luminary ... If I was a follower of the great man from Pesaro, so was everyone else&quot;
After Rossini moved to Paris in 1824, Pacini and his contemporaries (Giacomo Meyerbeer, Nicola Vaccai, Michele Carafa, Carlo Coccia, Vincenzo Bellini, Gaetano Donizetti, the brothers Federico and Luigi Ricci, and Saverio Mercadante) collectively began to change the nature of Italian opera and took bel canto singing in a new direction. Orchestration became heavier, coloratura was reduced, especially for men&#x27;s voices, and more importance was placed on lyrical pathos. While there were exceptions, romantic leads were assigned to tenors (in Rossini&#x27;s time, they were frequently sung by alto or mezzo-soprano women). Villains became basses or later baritones (while they often were tenors for Rossini). Over time, far more emphasis was placed on the drama.

The role that Pacini played in instituting these changes is only now beginning to be recognized. There is little doubt that Pacini and his contemporary Nicola Vaccai exerted a stronger influence on Bellini than has been credited before. This change in attitude can be credited to the revival of two key works: Vaccai&#x27;s &quot;Giulietta e Romeo&quot; and Pacini&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;ultimo giorno di Pompei&quot;, both composed in 1825 within a few weeks of each other.
The success of many of Pacini&#x27;s lighter operas especially &quot;Il Barone di Dolsheim, La sposa fedele,&quot; and &quot;La schiava in Bagdad&quot; (all composed between 1818 and 1820) made Pacini one of the most prominent composers in Italy. His position was greatly enhanced by the rapid-fire successes of &quot;Alessandro nelle Indie&quot; (Naples, 1824, revised, Milan, 1826; given and recorded in London in November 2006), &quot;Amazilia&quot; (Naples 1824, revised, Vienna, 1827), and the previously mentioned &quot;L&#x27;Ultimo giorno di Pompei&quot; (Naples, 1825).

In &quot;Alessandro nelle Indie&quot;, the title role of Alessandro was created by a baritonal tenor, Andrea Nozzari, but it was sung by the much lighter-voiced Giovanni David at the Milan revival, indicating Pacini&#x27;s desire to go in a new direction. &quot;Arabi nelle Gallie&quot; (Milan, 1827) reached many of the world&#x27;s most important stages and was the first Pacini opera to be given in the United States. It was staged frequently in Italy, and it was not until 1830 that Bellini&#x27;s first success, &quot;Il pirata&quot; (also Milan, 1827) passed &quot;Gli arabi nelle Gallie&quot; in number of performances at the Teatro alla Scala. While this is not generally recognized, it was Pacini, rather than Donizetti, Mercadante or Bellini, who gave Rossini the stiffest competition in Italy during the 1820s.

Many operas followed that are almost completely forgotten. However, one of these, &quot;Il corsaro&quot; (Rome, 1831) was revived 173 years later, in 2004, albeit only with piano accompaniment. This work is different in many ways from Verdi&#x27;s later opera by the same name. The title role, Corrado, is a musico role for an alto, and the villainous Seid is a tenor.

However, first Bellini and then Donizetti outstripped Pacini in fame. Many of his later operas, such as &quot;Carlo di Borgogna&quot; of 1835, were failures, but this is one of the few Pacini operas currently available on CD, and it has received many warm reviews. Pacini himself was the first to recognize his apparent defeat noted in memoirs: &quot;I began to realize that I must withdraw from the field. Bellini, the divine Bellini, has surpassed me.&quot; Some years later, he resumed composing, and, after one more setback, enjoyed his greatest triumph with &quot;Saffo&quot; (Naples, 1840).

After &quot;Saffo&quot;, Pacini entered into another period of prominence. Donizetti had departed for Paris, Bellini had died, and Mercadante&#x27;s major successes were behind him, thus Verdi offered the only important competition. Pacini&#x27;s successes during this time period include &quot;La fidanzata corsa&quot; (Naples, 1842), &quot;Maria, regina d&#x27;Inghilterra&quot; (Palermo, 1843), &quot;Medea&quot; (Palermo, 1843 with several later revisions, the last of which was in Naples in 1853), &quot;Lorenzino de&#x27; Medici&quot; (Venice, 1845), &quot;Bondelmonte&quot; (Florence, 1845), &quot;Stella di Napoli&quot; (Naples,1845) and &quot;La regina di Cipro&quot; (Turin, 1846). &quot;Allan Cameron&quot; (Venice, 1848) is noteworthy because it deals with the youth of King Charles II, before he was crowned King of England. In contrast—by 1844—Verdi had written &quot;Nabucco&quot;, &quot;I Lombardi&quot;, and &quot;Ernani&quot;, thus outstripping Pacini.

This period of accomplishments was followed by a long but slow decline, marked only by the moderate successes of &quot;La punizione&quot; (Venice, 1854), &quot;Il saltimbanco&quot; (Rome, 1858), and &quot;Niccolò de&#x27; Lapi&quot; (Florence, 1873).

Pacini died in Pescia, Tuscany in 1867. During his lifetime, he produced much music of high caliber. His output of more than 70 stage works is staggering even compared to Rossini (41 operas) and Handel (43 operas), and he will always be remembered, with Donizetti, as one of the most prolific composers in the history of opera.

<text>Giovanni Paisiello (or Paesiello; 9 May 1740 – 5 June 1816) was an Italian composer of the Classical era, and was the most popular opera composer of the late 1700s. His operatic style influenced Mozart and Rossini.

==Life==

Paisiello was born in Taranto in the Apulia region and educated by the Jesuits there. He became known for his beautiful singing voice and in 1754 was sent to the Conservatorio di S. Onofrio at Naples, where he studied under Francesco Durante, and eventually became assistant master. For the theatre of the Conservatorio, which he left in 1763, he wrote some intermezzi, one of which attracted so much notice that he was invited to write two operas, &quot;La Pupilla&quot; and &quot;Il Mondo al Rovescio&quot;, for Bologna, and a third, &quot;Il Marchese di Tidipano&quot;, for Rome.

His reputation now firmly established, he settled for some years at Naples, where, despite the popularity of Niccolò Piccinni, Domenico Cimarosa and Pietro Guglielmi, of whose triumphs he was bitterly jealous, he produced a series of highly successful operas, one of which, &quot;L&#x27;idolo cinese&quot;, made a deep impression upon the Neapolitan public. The young Mozart and his father met him in Bologna in 1771.

In 1772, Paisiello began to write church music and composed a requiem for Gennara di Borbone, of the reigning dynasty. In the same year, he married Cecilia Pallini, and the marriage was a happy one. In 1776, Paisiello was invited by the empress Catherine the Great of Russia to Saint Petersburg, where he remained for eight years, producing, among other charming works, his masterpiece, &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot;, which soon attained a European reputation. The fate of this opera marks an epoch in the history of Italian art; for with it the gentle suavity cultivated by the masters of the 18th century died out to make room for the dazzling brilliance of a later period.

When, in 1816, Gioachino Rossini set a revised version of the libretto to music, under the title of &quot;Almaviva ossia la inutil precauzione&quot; the fans of Paisiello stormed the stage. Rossini&#x27;s opera, now known as &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot;, is now acknowledged as Rossini&#x27;s greatest work, while Paisiello&#x27;s opera is only infrequently produced—a strange instance of poetical vengeance since Paisiello himself had many years previously endeavoured to eclipse the fame of Giovanni Battista Pergolesi by resetting the libretto of his famous intermezzo, &quot;La serva padrona&quot;.

Paisiello left Russia in 1784, and, after producing &quot;Il Re Teodoro&quot; at Vienna, entered the service of Ferdinand IV of Naples, where he composed many of his best operas, including &quot;Nina&quot; and &quot;La Molinara&quot;. 

The Irish tenor Michael Kelly witnessed another meeting between Paisiello and Mozart when he visited Vienna later that year. Mozart had just finished a string of piano concertos, K. 449 and 453, written for his pupil Barbara Ployer. When Ployer’s father arranged a performance at his summer estate in Döbling, Mozart wrote to his father, &quot;Fräulein Babette will play her new concerto in G and I shall play the Quintet and then we’ll perform together the grand sonata for two pianos. I shall fetch Paisiello with my carriage for I want him to hear my compositions as well as my pupil.&quot;

After many vicissitudes, resulting from political and dynastic changes, he was invited to Paris (1802) by Napoleon, whose favour he had won five years previously by composing a march for the funeral of General Hoche. Napoleon treated him munificently, while cruelly neglecting two more famous composers, Luigi Cherubini and Étienne Méhul, to whom the new favourite transferred the hatred he had formerly borne to Cimarosa, Guglielmi and Piccinni.

Paisiello is known to have composed 94 operas, which are known for their gracefully beautiful melodies. Perhaps the best-known tune he ever wrote is &quot;Nel cor più non mi sento&quot; from &quot;La Molinara&quot;, immortalized when Beethoven composed piano variations based on it. Paganini also wrote violin variations based on the same tune. Another favourite vocal piece is &quot;Chi vuol la zingarella&quot; from &quot;I zingari in fiera&quot;, which vividly portrays the scene of an attractive gypsy girl with its dramatic music. Paisiello also wrote a great deal of church music, including eight masses; as well as fifty-one instrumental compositions and many stand-alone songs. He also composed the Inno al Re, the national anthem of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Manuscript scores of many of his operas were presented to the library of the British Museum by Domenico Dragonetti.

The library of the Gerolamini at Naples possesses an interesting manuscript compilation recording Paisiello&#x27;s opinions on contemporary composers, and exhibiting him as a somewhat severe critic, especially of the work of Pergolesi.

The &quot;Grove Concise Dictionary of Music&quot; notes that &quot;Paisiello was one of the most successful and influential opera composers of his time. Most of his over 80 operas are comic and use a simple, direct and spirited style, latterly with sharper characterization, more colourful scoring and warmer melodies (features that influenced Mozart). His serious operas have less than the conventional amount of virtuoso vocal writing; those for Russia are the closest to Gluck&#x27;s &#x27;reform&#x27; approach.

<doc id="37947" wikidata="Q428124" url="?curid=37947" title="Violet (color)">
<text>Violet is the color of light at the short wavelength end of the visible spectrum. It is one of the seven colors that Isaac Newton labeled when dividing the spectrum of visible light in 1672. Violet light has a wavelength between approximately 380 and 450 nanometers. The color&#x27;s name is derived from the &quot;Viola&quot; genus of flowers.

In the RGB color model used in computer and television screens, violet is produced by mixing red and blue light, with more blue than red. In the RYB color model historically used by painters, violet is created with a combination of red and blue pigments and is located between blue and purple on the color wheel. In the CMYK color model used in printing, violet is created with a combination of magenta and cyan pigments, with more magenta than cyan. On the RGB/CMY(K) color wheel, violet is located between blue and magenta.

Violet is closely associated with purple. In optics, violet is a spectral color (referring to the color of different single wavelengths of light), whereas purple is the color of various combinations of red and blue (or violet) light, some of which humans perceive as similar to violet. In common usage, both terms are used to refer to a variety of colors between blue and red in hue.

Violet has a long history of association with royalty, originally because Tyrian purple dye was extremely expensive in antiquity. The emperors of Rome wore purple togas, as did the Byzantine emperors. During the Middle Ages, violet was worn by bishops and university professors and was often used in art as the color of the robes of the Virgin Mary. In Chinese painting, the color violet represents the &quot;unity transcending the duality of Yin and yang&quot; and &quot;the ultimate harmony of the universe&quot;. In New Age thinking, purple and/or violet is associated with the crown chakra. One European study suggests that violet is the color people most often associate with extravagance, individualism, vanity and ambiguity.

==Etymology and definitions==

The word &quot;violet&quot; as a color name derives from the Middle English and Old French &quot;violete&quot;, in turn from the Latin &quot;viola&quot;, the name of the violet flower. The first recorded use as a color name in English was in 1370.

===Relationship to purple===
Violet is closely associated with purple. In optics, violet is a spectral color: It refers to the color of any different single wavelength of light on the short wavelength end of the visible spectrum (between approximately 380 and 435 nanometers), whereas purple is the color of various combinations of red, blue and violet light, some of which some humans perceive as similar to violet. In common usage, both terms are used to refer to a variety of colors between blue and red in hue. Historically, violet has tended to be used for bluer hues and purple for redder hues. In the traditional color wheel used by painters, violet and purple are both placed between red and blue, with violet being closer to blue.

==In science==

===Optics===

Violet is at one end of the spectrum of visible light, between blue light, which has a longer wavelength, and ultraviolet light, which has a shorter wavelength and is not visible to humans. Violet wavelengths are between approximately 380 and 435 nanometers. Violet objects often appear dark, because human vision becomes less sensitive at wavelengths this short. The reason why to (typical trichromat) humans violet light appears slightly reddish compared to spectral blue (despite spectral red being at the other end of the visible spectrum) is, according to the opponent process hypothesis of color vision, that the S-cone type (i.e. the one most sensitive to short wavelengths) contributes some red to the red-versus-green opponent channel (which at the longer blue wavelengths gets counteracted by the M-cone type). Computer and television screens, using the RGB color model, cannot produce actual violet light and instead mimic it by combining blue light at high intensity with red light at less intensity.

Violet objects are normally composed-light violet. Objects reflecting spectral violet appear very dark, because human vision is relatively insensitive to those wavelengths. Monochromatic lamps emitting spectral-violet wavelengths can be roughly approximated by the color named electric violet, which is a composed-light violet producing a similar effect to the human eye.

===Chemistry – pigments and dyes===
The earliest violet pigments used by humans, found in prehistoric cave paintings, were made from the minerals manganese and hematite. Manganese is still used today by the Aranda people, a group of indigenous Australians, as a traditional pigment for coloring the skin during rituals. It is also used by the Hopi Indians of Arizona to color ritual objects.

The most famous violet-purple dye in the ancient world was Tyrian purple, made from a type of sea snail called the murex, found around the Mediterranean.

In western Polynesia, residents of the islands made a violet dye similar to Tyrian purple from the sea urchin. In Central America, the inhabitants made a dye from a different sea snail, the purpura, found on the coasts of Costa Rica and Nicaragua. The Mayans used this color to dye fabric for religious ceremonies, and the Aztecs used it for paintings of ideograms, where it symbolized royalty.

During the Middle Ages, most artists made purple or violet on their paintings by combining red and blue pigments; usually blue azurite or lapis-lazuli with red ochre, cinnabar or minium. They also combined lake colors by mixing dye with powder; woad or indigo dye for blue and cochineal dye for red.

Orcein, or &quot;purple moss&quot;, was another common violet dye. It was known to the ancient Greeks and Hebrews, was made from a Mediterranean lichen called archil or dyer&#x27;s moss (Roccella tinctoria), combined with an ammoniac, usually urine. Orcein began to achieve popularity again in the 19th century, when violet and purple became the color of demi-mourning, worn after a widow or widower had worn black for a certain time, before he or she returned to wearing ordinary colors.

In the 18th century, chemists in England, France and Germany began to create the first synthetic dyes. Two synthetic purple dyes were invented at about the same time. Cudbear is a dye extracted from orchil lichens that can be used to dye wool and silk, without the use of mordant. Cudbear was developed by Cuthbert Gordon of Scotland: production began in 1758, The lichen is first boiled in a solution of ammonium carbonate. The mixture is then cooled and ammonia is added and the mixture is kept damp for 3–4 weeks. Then the lichen is dried and ground to powder. The manufacture details were carefully protected, with a ten-foot high wall built around the manufacturing facility, and staff consisting of Highlanders sworn to secrecy.

French purple was developed in France at about the same time. The lichen is extracted by urine or ammonia. Then the extract is acidified, the dissolved dye precipitates and is washed. Then it is dissolved in ammonia again, the solution is heated in air until it becomes purple, then it is precipitated with calcium chloride; the resulting dye was more solid and stable than other purples.

Cobalt violet is a synthetic pigment that was invented in the second half of the 19th century, and is made by a similar process as cobalt blue, cerulean blue and cobalt green. It is the violet pigment most commonly used today by artists, along with manganese violet.

Mauveine, also known as aniline purple and Perkin&#x27;s mauve, was the first synthetic organic chemical dye, discovered serendipitously during an attempt to make quinine in 1856. Its chemical name is 3-amino-2,±9-dimethyl-5-phenyl-7-(p-tolylamino) phenazinium acetate.

In the 1950s, a new family of violet synthetic organic pigments called quinacridones came onto the market. They had originally been discovered in 1896, synthesized in 1936 and manufactured in the 1950s. The colors in the group range from deep red to violet in color, and have the molecular formula C20H12N2O2. They have strong resistance to sunlight and washing, and are used in oil paints, watercolors and acrylics, as well as in automobile coatings and other industrial coatings.

==In history and art==

=== Prehistory and antiquity ===
Violet is one of the oldest colors used by humans. Traces of very dark violet, made by grinding the mineral manganese, mixed with water or animal fat and then brushed on the cave wall or applied with the fingers, are found in the prehistoric cave art in Pech Merle, in France, dating back about 25,000 years. It has also been found in the cave of Altamira and Lascaux. It was sometimes used as an alternative to black charcoal. Sticks of manganese, used for drawing, have been found at sites occupied by Neanderthals in France and Israel. From the grinding tools at various sites, it appears it may also have been used to color the body and to decorate animal skins.

More recently, the earliest dates on cave paintings have been pushed back farther than 35,000 years. Hand paintings on rock walls in Australia may be even older, dating back as far as 50,000 years.

Berries of the genus rubus, such as blackberries, were a common source of dyes in antiquity. The ancient Egyptians made a kind of violet dye by combining the juice of the mulberry with crushed green grapes. The Roman historian Pliny the Elder reported that the Gauls used a violet dye made from bilberry to color the clothing of slaves. These dyes made a satisfactory purple, but it faded quickly in sunlight and when washed.

===Middle Ages and Renaissance===
Violet and purple retained their status as the color of emperors and princes of the church throughout the long rule of the Byzantine Empire.

While violet was worn less frequently by Medieval and Renaissance kings and princes, it was worn by the professors of many of Europe&#x27;s new universities. Their robes were modeled after those of the clergy, and they often wore square violet caps and violet robes, or black robes with violet trim.

Violet also played an important part in the religious paintings of the Renaissance. Angels and the Virgin Mary were often portrayed wearing violet robes. The 15th-century Florentine painter Cennino Cennini advised artists: &quot;If you want to make a lovely violet colour, take fine lacca, ultramarine blue (the same amount of the one as of the other)...&quot; For fresco painters, he advised a less-expensive version, made of a mixture of blue indigo and red hematite.

===18th and 19th centuries===
In the 18th century, purple was a color worn by royalty, aristocrats and other wealthy people. Good-quality purple fabric was too expensive for ordinary people.

The first cobalt violet, the intensely red-violet cobalt arsenate, was highly toxic. Although it persisted in some paint lines into the 20th century, it was displaced by less toxic cobalt compounds such as cobalt phosphate. Cobalt violet appeared in the second half of the 19th century, broadening the palette of artists with its range of purple colors. Cobalt violet was used by Paul Signac (1863–1935), Claude Monet (1840–1926) and Georges Seurat (1859–1891). Today, cobalt ammonium phosphate, cobalt lithium phosphate and cobalt phosphate are available for use by artists. Cobalt ammonium phosphate is the most reddish of the three. Cobalt phosphate is available in two varieties — a deep less saturated blueish type and a lighter and brighter somewhat more reddish type. Cobalt lithium phosphate is a saturated lighter-valued bluish violet. A color similar to cobalt ammonium phosphate, cobalt magnesium borate, was introduced in the later 20th century but was not deemed sufficiently lightfast for artistic use. Cobalt violet is the only truly lightfast purple pigment with relatively strong color saturation. All other light-stable purple pigments are dull by comparison. The high price of the pigment and the toxicity of cobalt have limited its use.

In the 1860s, the popularity of using violet colors suddenly rose among painters and other artists. For example, Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890) was an avid student of color theory. He used violet in many of his paintings of the 1880s, including his paintings of irises and the swirling and mysterious skies of his starry night paintings, and often combined it with its complementary color, yellow. In his painting of his bedroom in Arles (1888), he used several sets of complementary colors; violet and yellow, red and green and orange and blue. In a letter about the painting to his brother Theo, he wrote, &quot;The color here...should be suggestive of sleep and repose in general...The walls are a pale violet. The floor is of red tiles. The wood of the bed and the chairs are fresh butter yellow, the sheet and the pillows light lemon green. The bedspread bright scarlet. The window green. The bed table orange. The bowl blue. The doors lilac...The painting should rest the head or the imagination.&quot;

In 1856, a young British chemist named William Henry Perkin was trying to make a synthetic quinine. His experiments produced instead an unexpected residue, which turned out to be the first synthetic aniline dye, a deep purple color called mauveine, or abbreviated simply to mauve (the dye being named after the lighter color of the mallow [mauve] flower). Used to dye clothes, it became extremely fashionable among the nobility and upper classes in Europe, particularly after Queen Victoria wore a silk gown dyed with mauveine to the Royal Exhibition of 1862. Prior to Perkin&#x27;s discovery, mauve was a color which only the aristocracy and rich could afford to wear. Perkin developed an industrial process, built a factory, and produced the dye by the ton so almost anyone could wear mauve. It was the first of a series of modern industrial dyes which completely transformed both the chemical industry and fashion.

===20th and 21st centuries===

Violet or purple neckties became popular at the end of the first decade of the 21st century, particularly among political and business leaders.

==In culture==
===Popularity===
In a European survey, three percent of respondents said violet is their favorite color, ranking it behind blue, green, red, black and yellow (in that order), and tied with orange. Ten percent called it their least favorite color; brown, pink and gray were more unpopular.

===Royalty and luxury===
Because of its status as the color of Roman emperors, monarchs and princes, purple and violet are often associated with luxury. Certain luxury goods, such as watches and jewelry, are often placed in boxes lined with violet velvet, since violet is the complementary color of yellow and shows gold to best advantage.

===Vanity, extravagance and individualism===
While violet is the color of humility in the symbolism of the Catholic Church, it has exactly the opposite meaning in general society. A European poll in 2000 showed it was the color most commonly associated with vanity. As a color that rarely exists in nature and so attracts attention, it is seen as a color of individualism and extravagance.

===Heian period===
In Japan, violet was a popular color introduced into dress during the Heian period (794–1185). The dye was made from the root of the alkanet plant (&quot;Anchusa officinalis&quot;), known as &quot;murasaki&quot; in Japanese. At about the same time, Japanese painters began to use a pigment made from the same plant.

===New Age===
The &quot;New Age Prophetess&quot;, Alice Bailey, in her system called the Seven Rays which classifies humans into seven different metaphysical psychological types, the &quot;seventh ray&quot; of &quot;Ceremonial Order&quot; is represented by the color violet. People who have this metaphysical psychological type are said to be &quot;on the Violet Ray&quot;.

In the Ascended Master Teachings, the color violet is used to represent the Ascended Master St. Germain.

&quot;The Invocation of the Violet Flame&quot; is a system of meditation practice used in the &quot;I AM&quot; Activity and by the Church Universal and Triumphant (both Ascended Master Teaching religions).

===Religion===
In the Roman Catholic church, violet is worn by bishops and archbishops, red by cardinals and white by the Pope. Ordinary priests wear black. As in many other Western churches, violet is the liturgical color of Advent and Lent, which respectively celebrate the expectant waiting and preparation for the celebration of the Crucifixion of Jesus and the time for penance and/or mourning.

A stained glass window installed in the early 1920s in the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Los Angeles depicts God the Father wearing a violet robe.

After the Vatican II Council, which modified many of the rules of the Catholic church, priests began to wear violet robes when celebrating masses for the dead. Black was no longer used, since it was the color of mourning outside the church and deemed inappropriate in a religious ceremony.

In Hinduism, violet is used to symbolically represent the seventh, crown chakra (Sahasrara).

===Politics===
In the early 20th century, violet, white and gold were the colors of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement in the United States, seeking the right to vote for women. The colors were said to represent liberty and dignity. For this reason, the postage stamp issued in 1936 to honor Susan B. Anthony, a prominent leader of the suffrage movement in the United States, was colored the reddish tone of violet sometimes known as red-violet.

In 1908, Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, co-editor of the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (WSPU) newspaper, designed the color scheme for the suffragette movement in Britain and Ireland, with violet for loyalty and dignity, white for purity and green for hope.

The pan-European movement Volt Europa and its national subsidiary parties use violet in their uniforms.

A small New Age political party in Germany with about 1,150 members is called The Violet Party. It believes in direct democracy, a guaranteed minimum income and politics based on spirituality. It was founded in Dortmund in 2001.

===Lesbianism===
Violet flowers and their color became symbolically associated with lesbianism. It was used as a special code by lesbians and bisexual women for self-identification and also to communicate support for the sexual preference. This connection originates from the poet Sappho and fragments of her poems. In one poem, she describes a lost partner wearing a garland of &quot;violet tiaras, braided rosebuds, dill and crocus twined around&quot; her neck. In another fragment, she recalls her partner as having &quot;put around yourself [many wreaths] of violets and roses.&quot;

The labrys lesbian flag, created in 1999 by graphic designer Sean Campbell, features a labrys superimposed on the inverted black triangle set against a violet background.

<text>Purple is a color similar in appearance to violet light. In the RYB color model historically used in the arts, purple is a secondary color created by combining red and blue pigments. In the CMYK color model used in modern printing, purple is made by combining magenta pigment with either cyan pigment, black pigment, or both. In the RGB color model used in computer and television screens, purple is created by mixing red and blue light in order to create colors that appear similar to violet light.

Purple has long been associated with royalty, originally because Tyrian purple dye—made from the secretions of sea snails—was extremely expensive in antiquity. Purple was the color worn by Roman magistrates; it became the imperial color worn by the rulers of the Byzantine Empire and the Holy Roman Empire, and later by Roman Catholic bishops. Similarly in Japan, the color is traditionally associated with the emperor and aristocracy.

According to contemporary surveys in Europe and the United States, purple is the color most often associated with rarity, royalty, luxury, ambition, magic, mystery, piety and spirituality. When combined with pink, it is associated with eroticism, femininity, and seduction.

== Etymology and definitions ==
The modern English word &quot;purple&quot; comes from the Old English &quot;purpul,&quot; which derives from Latin &quot;purpura&quot;, which, in turn, derives from the Greek (&quot;porphura&quot;), the name of the Tyrian purple dye manufactured in classical antiquity from a mucus secreted by the spiny dye-murex snail. The first recorded use of the word &quot;purple&quot; dates to the late 900s AD.

== In art, history, and fashion ==
=== In prehistory and the ancient world ===
Purple first appeared in prehistoric art during the Neolithic era. The artists of Pech Merle cave and other Neolithic sites in France used sticks of manganese and hematite powder to draw and paint animals and the outlines of their own hands on the walls of their caves. These works have been dated to between 16,000 and 25,000 BC.

Purple textiles, dating back to the early second millennium BCE, were found in Syria, making them the oldest known purple textiles in the world. These findings include textiles from a burial site in Chagar Bazar, dating back to the 18th-16th centuries BCE, as well as preserved textile samples discovered in gypsum at the Royal Palace of Qatna.

As early as the 15th century BC, the citizens of Sidon and Tyre, two cities on the coast of Ancient Phoenicia (present day Lebanon), were producing purple dye from a sea snail called the spiny dye-murex. Clothing colored with the Tyrian dye was mentioned in both the &quot;Iliad&quot; of Homer and the &quot;Aeneid&quot; of Virgil. The deep, rich purple dye made from this snail became known as Tyrian purple.

The process of making the dye was long, difficult and expensive. Thousands of the tiny snails had to be found, their shells cracked, the snail removed. Mountains of empty shells have been found at the ancient sites of Sidon and Tyre. The snails were left to soak, then a tiny gland was removed and the juice extracted and put in a basin, which was placed in the sunlight. There, a remarkable transformation took place. In the sunlight the juice turned white, then yellow-green, then green, then violet, then a red which turned darker and darker. The process had to be stopped at exactly the right time to obtain the desired color, which could range from a bright crimson to a dark purple, the color of dried blood. Then either wool, linen or silk would be dyed. The exact hue varied between crimson and violet, but it was always rich, bright and lasting.

Tyrian purple became the color of kings, nobles, priests and magistrates all around the Mediterranean. It was mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament); in the Book of Exodus, God instructs Moses to have the Israelites bring him an offering including cloth &quot;of blue, and purple, and scarlet,&quot; to be used in the curtains of the Tabernacle and the garments of priests. The term used for purple in the 4th-century Latin Vulgate version of the Bible passage is &quot;purpura&quot; or Tyrian purple. In the &quot;Iliad&quot; of Homer, the belt of Ajax is purple, and the tails of the horses of Trojan warriors are dipped in purple. In the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, the blankets on the wedding bed of Odysseus are purple. In the poems of Sappho (6th century BC) she celebrates the skill of the dyers of the Greek kingdom of Lydia who made purple footwear, and in the play of Aeschylus (525–456 BC), Queen Clytemnestra welcomes back her husband Agamemnon by decorating the palace with purple carpets. In 950 BC, King Solomon was reported to have brought artisans from Tyre to provide purple fabrics to decorate the Temple of Jerusalem.

Alexander the Great (when giving imperial audiences as the basileus of the Macedonian Empire), the basileus of the Seleucid Empire, and the kings of Ptolemaic Egypt all wore Tyrian purple.

The Roman custom of wearing purple togas may have come from the Etruscans; an Etruscan tomb painting from the 4th century BC shows a nobleman wearing a deep purple and embroidered toga.

In Ancient Rome, the &quot;Toga praetexta&quot; was an ordinary white toga with a broad purple stripe on its border. It was worn by freeborn Roman boys who had not yet come of age, curule magistrates, certain categories of priests, and a few other categories of citizens.

The &quot;Toga picta&quot; was solid purple, embroidered with gold. During the Roman Republic, it was worn by generals in their triumphs, and by the Praetor Urbanus when he rode in the chariot of the gods into the circus at the Ludi Apollinares. During the Empire, the &quot;toga picta&quot; was worn by magistrates giving public gladiatorial games, and by the consuls, as well as by the emperor on special occasions.

During the Roman Republic, when a triumph was held, the general being honored wore an entirely purple toga bordered in gold, and Roman Senators wore a toga with a purple stripe. However, during the Roman Empire, purple was more and more associated exclusively with the emperors and their officers. Suetonius claims that the early emperor Caligula had the King of Mauretania murdered for the splendour of his purple cloak, and that Nero forbade the use of certain purple dyes. In the late empire the sale of purple cloth became a state monopoly protected by the death penalty.

According to the New Testament, Jesus Christ, in the hours leading up to his crucifixion, was dressed in purple (πορφύρα: &quot;porphura&quot;) by the Roman garrison to mock his claim to be &#x27;King of the Jews&#x27;.

The actual color of Tyrian purple seems to have varied from a reddish to a bluish purple. According to the Roman writer Vitruvius, (1st century BC), the murex shells coming from northern waters, probably &quot;Bolinus brandaris&quot;, produced a more bluish color than those of the south, probably &quot;Hexaplex trunculus&quot;. The most valued shades were said to be those closer to the color of dried blood, as seen in the mosaics of the robes of the Emperor Justinian in Ravenna. The chemical composition of the dye from the murex is close to that of the dye from indigo, and indigo was sometimes used to make a counterfeit Tyrian purple, a crime which was severely punished. What seems to have mattered about Tyrian purple was not its color, but its luster, richness, its resistance to weather and light, and its high price.

In modern times, Tyrian purple has been recreated, at great expense. When the German chemist Paul Friedander tried to recreate Tyrian purple in 2008, he needed twelve thousand mollusks to create 1.4 ounces of dye, enough to color a handkerchief. In the year 2000, a gram of Tyrian purple made from ten thousand mollusks according to the original formula cost two thousand euros.

==== China ====

In ancient China, purple was obtained not through the Mediterranean mollusc, but purple gromwell. The dye obtained did not easily adhere to fabrics, making purple fabrics expensive. Purple became a fashionable color in the state of Qi (齊, 1046 BC–221 BC) because its ruler, Duke Huan of Qi, developed a preference for it. As a result, the price of purple fabric was over five times that of plain fabric. His minister, Guan Zhong (管仲), eventually convinced him to relinquish this preference.

China was the first culture to develop a synthetic purple color.

An old hypothesis suggested links between the Chinese purple and blue and Egyptian blue, however, molecular structure analysis and evidence such as the absence of lead in Egyptian blue and the lack of examples of Egyptian blue in China, argued against the hypothesis. The use of quartz, barium, and lead components in ancient Chinese glass and Han purple and Han blue has been used to suggest a connection between glassmaking and the manufacture of pigments, and to prove the independence of the Chinese invention. Taoist alchemists may have developed Han purple from their knowledge of glassmaking.

Lead is used by the pigment maker to lower the melting point of the barium in Han Purple.

Purple was regarded as a secondary color in ancient China. In classical times, secondary colors were not as highly prized as the five primary colors of the Chinese spectrum, and purple was used to allude to impropriety, in contrast to crimson, which was deemed a primary color and symbolized legitimacy. Nevertheless, by the 6th century AD, purple was ranked above crimson. Several changes to the ranks of colors occurred after that time.

=== Purple in the Byzantine Empire and Carolingian Europe ===
Through the early Christian era, the rulers of the Byzantine Empire continued the use of purple as the imperial color, for diplomatic gifts, and even for imperial documents and the pages of the Bible. Gospel manuscripts were written in gold lettering on parchment that was colored Tyrian purple. Empresses gave birth in the Purple Chamber, and the emperors born there were known as &quot;born to the purple,&quot; to separate them from emperors who won or seized the title through political intrigue or military force. Bishops of the Byzantine church wore white robes with stripes of purple, while government officials wore squares of purple fabric to show their rank.

In western Europe, the Emperor Charlemagne was crowned in 800 wearing a mantle of Tyrian purple, and was buried in 814 in a shroud of the same color, which still exists (see below). However, after the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453, the color lost its imperial status. The great dye works of Constantinople were destroyed, and gradually scarlet, made with dye from the cochineal insect, became the royal color in Europe.
=== The Middle Ages and Renaissance ===
In 1464, Pope Paul II decreed that cardinals should no longer wear Tyrian purple, and instead wear scarlet, from kermes and alum, since the dye from Byzantium was no longer available. Bishops and archbishops, of a lower status than cardinals, were assigned the color purple, but not the rich Tyrian purple. They wore cloth dyed first with the less expensive indigo blue, then overlaid with red made from kermes dye.

While purple was worn less frequently by medieval and Renaissance kings and princes, it was worn by the professors of many of Europe&#x27;s new universities. Their robes were modeled after those of the clergy, and they often wore square/violet or purple/violet caps and robes, or black robes with purple/violet trim. Purple/violet robes were particularly worn by students of divinity.

Purple and violet also played an important part in the religious paintings of the Renaissance. Angels and the Virgin Mary were often portrayed wearing purple or violet robes.

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
In the 18th century, purple was still worn on occasion by Catherine the Great and other rulers, by bishops and, in lighter shades, by members of the aristocracy, but rarely by ordinary people, because of its high cost. But in the 19th century, that changed.

In 1856, an eighteen-year-old British chemistry student named William Henry Perkin was trying to make a synthetic quinine. His experiments produced instead the first synthetic aniline dye, a purple shade called mauveine, shortened simply to mauve. It took its name from the mallow flower, which is the same color. The new color quickly became fashionable, particularly after Queen Victoria wore a silk gown dyed with mauveine to the Royal Exhibition of 1862. Prior to Perkin&#x27;s discovery, mauve was a color which only the aristocracy and rich could afford to wear. Perkin developed an industrial process, built a factory, and produced the dye by the ton, so almost anyone could wear mauve. It was the first of a series of modern industrial dyes which completely transformed both the chemical industry and fashion.

Purple was popular with the pre-Raphaelite painters in Britain, including Arthur Hughes, who loved bright colors and romantic scenes.

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
At the turn of the century, purple was a favorite color of the Austrian painter Gustav Klimt, who flooded his pictures with sensual purples and violets.

In the 20th century, purple retained its historic connection with royalty; George VI (1896–1952), wore purple in his official portrait, and it was prominent in every feature of the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953, from the invitations to the stage design inside Westminster Abbey. But at the same time, it was becoming associated with social change; with the Women&#x27;s Suffrage movement for the right to vote for women in the early decades of the century, with Feminism in the 1970s, and with the psychedelic drug culture of the 1960s.

In the early 20th century, purple, green, and white were the colors of the Women&#x27;s Suffrage movement, which fought to win the right to vote for women, finally succeeding with the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920. Later, in the 1970s, in a tribute to the Suffragettes, it became the color of the women&#x27;s liberation movement.

In the concentration camps of Nazi Germany, prisoners who were members of non-conformist religious groups, such as the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, were required to wear a purple triangle.

During the 1960s and early 1970s, it was also associated with counterculture, psychedelics, and musicians like Jimi Hendrix with his 1967 song &quot;Purple Haze&quot;, or the English rock band of Deep Purple which formed in 1968. Later, in the 1980s, it was featured in the song and album &quot;Purple Rain&quot; (1984) by the American musician Prince.

The Purple Rain Protest was a protest against apartheid that took place in Cape Town, South Africa on 2 September 1989, in which a police water cannon with purple dye sprayed thousands of demonstrators. This led to the slogan &quot;The Purple Shall Govern&quot;.

The violet or purple necktie became very popular at the end of the first decade of the 21st century, particularly among political and business leaders. It combined the assertiveness and confidence of a red necktie with the sense of peace and cooperation of a blue necktie, and it went well with the blue business suit worn by most national and corporate leaders.

== In science and nature ==
=== Optics ===
The meanings of the color terms violet and purple varies even among native speakers of English, for example between United Kingdom and United States. Optics research on purple and violet contains contributions of authors from different countries and different native languages, it is likely to be inconsistent in the use and meaning of the two colors.

According to some speakers/authors of English, purple, unlike violet, is not one of the colors of the visible spectrum. It was not one of the colors of the rainbow identified by Isaac Newton. According to some authors, purple does not have its own wavelength of light. For this reason, it is sometimes called a &quot;non-spectral color&quot;. It exists in culture and art, but not, in the same way that violet does, in optics. According to some speakers of English, purple is simply a combination, in various proportions, of two primary colors, red and blue. According to other speakers of English, the same range of colors is called violet.

In some textbooks of color theory, and depending on the geographical-cultural origin of the author, a &quot;purple&quot; is defined as any non-spectral color between violet and red (excluding violet and red themselves). In that case, the spectral colors violet and indigo would not be shades of purple. For other speakers of English, these colors are shades of purple.

In the traditional color wheel long used by painters, purple is placed between crimson and violet. However, also here there is much variation in color terminology depending on cultural background of the painters and authors, and sometimes the term violet is used and placed in between red and blue on the traditional color wheel. In a slightly different variation, on the color wheel, purple is placed between magenta and violet. This shade is sometimes called electric purple (see shades of purple).

In the RGB color model, named for the colors red, green, and blue, used to create all the colors on a computer screen or television, the range of purples is created by mixing red and blue light of different intensities on a black screen. The standard HTML color purple is created by red and blue light of equal intensity, at a brightness that is halfway between full power and darkness.

In color printing, purple is sometimes represented by the color magenta, or sometimes by mixing magenta with red or blue. It can also be created by mixing just red and blue alone, but in that case the purple is less bright, with lower
saturation or intensity. A less bright purple can also be created with light or paint by adding a certain quantity of the third primary color (green for light or yellow for pigment).

=== Relationship with violet ===

Purple is closely associated with violet. In common usage, both refer to a variety of colors between blue and red in hue. Historically, purple has tended to be used for redder hues and violet for bluer hues. In optics, violet is a spectral color; it refers to the color of any different single wavelength of light on the short wavelength end of the visible spectrum, between approximately 380 and 450 nanometers, whereas purple is the color of various combinations of red, blue, and violet light, some of which humans perceive as similar to violet.

On a chromaticity diagram, the straight line connecting the extreme spectral colors (red and violet) is known as the line of purples (or &#x27;purple boundary&#x27;); it represents one limit of human color perception. The color magenta used in the CMYK printing process is near the center of the line of purples, but most people associate the term &quot;purple&quot; with a somewhat bluer tone, such as is displayed by the color &quot;electric purple&quot; (a color also directly on the line of purples), shown below.

On the CIE xy chromaticity diagram, violet is on the curved edge in the lower left, while purples are on the straight line connecting the extreme colors red and violet; this line is known as the line of purples, or the purple line.

=== Pigments ===
*Hematite and manganese are the oldest pigments used for the color purple. They were used by Neolithic artists in the form of sticks, like charcoal, or ground and powdered and mixed with fat, and used as a paint. Hematite is a reddish iron oxide which, when ground coarsely, makes a purple pigment. One such pigment is caput mortuum, whose name is also used in reference to mummy brown. The latter is another pigment containing hematite and historically produced with the use of mummified corpses. Some of its compositions produce a purple color and may be called &quot;mummy violet&quot;. Manganese was also used in Roman times to color glass purple.
*Han purple was the first synthetic purple pigment, invented in China in about 700 BC. It was used in wall paintings and pottery and other applications. In color, it was very close to indigo, which had a similar chemical structure. Han purple was very unstable, and sometimes was the result of the chemical breakdown of Han blue.

During the Middle Ages, artists usually made purple by combining red and blue pigments; most often blue azurite or lapis-lazuli with red ochre, cinnabar, or minium. They also combined lake colors made by mixing dye with powder; using woad or indigo dye for the blue, and dye made from cochineal for the red.

*Cobalt violet was the first modern synthetic color in the purple family, manufactured in 1859. It was found, along with cobalt blue, in the palette of Claude Monet, Paul Signac, and Georges Seurat. It was stable, but had low tinting power and was expensive, so quickly went out of use.
*Manganese violet was a stronger color than cobalt violet, and replaced it on the market.
*Quinacridone violet, one of a modern synthetic organic family of colors, was discovered in 1896 but not marketed until 1955. It is sold today under a number of brand names.
=== Dyes ===
The most famous purple dye in the ancient world was Tyrian purple, made from a type of sea snail called the murex, found around the Mediterranean. (See history section above).

In western Polynesia, residents of the islands made a purple dye similar to Tyrian purple from the sea urchin. In Central America, the inhabitants made a dye from a different sea snail, the purpura, found on the coasts of Costa Rica and Nicaragua. The Mayans used this color to dye fabric for religious ceremonies, while the Aztecs used it for paintings of ideograms, where it symbolized royalty.

In the Middle Ages, those who worked with blue and black dyes belonged to separate guilds from those who worked with red and yellow dyes, and were often forbidden to dye any other colors than those of their own guild. Most purple fabric was made by the dyers who worked with red, and who used dye from madder or cochineal, so medieval violet colors were inclined toward red.

Orcein, or &quot;purple moss&quot;, was another common purple dye. It was known to the ancient Greeks and Hebrews, and was made from a Mediterranean lichen called archil or dyer&#x27;s moss (Roccella tinctoria), combined with an ammoniac, usually urine. Orcein began to achieve popularity again in the 19th century, when violet and purple became the color of demi-mourning, worn after a widow or widower had worn black for a certain time, before he or she returned to wearing ordinary colors.

From the Middle Ages onward, purple dyes for the clothing of common people were often made from the blackberry or other red fruit of the genus rubus, or from the mulberry. All of these dyes were more reddish than bluish, and faded easily with washing and exposure to sunlight.

A popular new dye which arrived in Europe from the New World during the Renaissance was made from the wood of the logwood tree (H&quot;aematoxylum campechianum&quot;), which grew in Spanish Mexico. Depending on the different minerals added to the dye, it produced a blue, red, black or, with the addition of alum, a purple color, it made a good color, but, like earlier dyes, it did not resist sunlight or washing.

In the 18th century, chemists in England, France and Germany began to create the first synthetic dyes. Two synthetic purple dyes were invented at about the same time. Cudbear is a dye extracted from orchil lichens that can be used to dye wool and silk, without the use of mordant. Cudbear was developed by Dr Cuthbert Gordon of Scotland: production began in 1758, The lichen is first boiled in a solution of ammonium carbonate. The mixture is then cooled and ammonia is added and the mixture is kept damp for 3–4 weeks. Then the lichen is dried and ground to powder. The manufacture details were carefully protected, with a ten-feet high wall being built around the manufacturing facility, and staff consisting of Highlanders sworn to secrecy.

French purple was developed in France at about the same time. The lichen is extracted by urine or ammonia. Then the extract is acidified, the dissolved dye precipitates and is washed. Then it is dissolved in ammonia again, the solution is heated in air until it becomes purple, then it is precipitated with calcium chloride; the resulting dye was more solid and stable than other purples.

Cobalt violet is a synthetic pigment that was invented in the second half of the 19th century, and is made by a similar process as cobalt blue, cerulean blue and cobalt green. It is the violet pigment most commonly used today by artists. In spite of its name, this pigment produces a purple rather than violet color.

Mauveine, also known as aniline purple and Perkin&#x27;s mauve, was the first synthetic organic chemical dye, discovered serendipitously in 1856.

Its chemical name is 3-amino-2,±9-dimethyl-5-phenyl-7-(p-tolylamino)phenazinium acetate.

Fuchsine was another synthetic dye made shortly after mauveine. It produced a brilliant fuchsia color.

In the 1950s, a new family of purple and violet synthetic organic pigments called quinacridone came onto the market. It had originally been discovered in 1896, but were not synthesized until 1936, and not manufactured until the 1950s. The colors in the group range from deep red to bluish purple in color, and have the molecular formula C20H12N2O2. They have strong resistance to sunlight and washing, and are widely used today in oil paints, water colors, and acrylics, as well as in automobile coatings and other industrial coatings.
=== Animals ===
=== Anthocyanins ===
Certain grapes, eggplants, pansies and other fruits, vegetables and flowers may appear purple due to the presence of natural pigments called anthocyanins. These pigments are found in the leaves, roots, stems, vegetables, fruits and flowers of all plants. They aid photosynthesis by blocking harmful wavelengths of light that would damage the leaves. In flowers, the purple anthocyanins help attract insects who pollinate the flowers. Not all anthocyanins are purple; they vary in color from red to purple to blue, green, or yellow, depending upon the level of their pH.
=== Plants and flowers ===
*Purple needlegrass is the state grass of California.
=== Microbiology ===
*Purple bacteria are bacteria that are phototrophic, that is, capable of producing energy through photosynthesis.

*In April 2007, it was suggested that early archaea may have used retinal, a purple pigment, instead of chlorophyll, to extract energy from the sun. If so, large areas of the ocean and shoreline would have been colored purple; this is called the Purple Earth hypothesis.

=== Astronomy ===
* One of the stars in the Pleiades, called Pleione, is sometimes called &quot;Purple Pleione&quot; because, being a fast spinning star, it has a purple hue caused by its blue-white color being obscured by a spinning ring of electrically excited red hydrogen gas.
*The Purple Forbidden enclosure is a name used in traditional Chinese astronomy for those Chinese constellations that surround the north celestial pole.

=== Geography ===
*Purple Mountain is located on the eastern side of Nanjing. Its peaks are often found enveloped in purple clouds at dawn and dusk, hence comes its name &quot;Purple Mountain&quot;. The Purple Mountain Observatory is located there.
*Purple Mountain in County Kerry, Ireland, takes its name from the color of the shivered slate on its summit.
*Purple Mountain in Wyoming (el. ) is a mountain peak in the southern section of the Gallatin Range in Yellowstone National Park.
*Purple Mountain, Alaska
*Purple Mountain, Oregon
*Purple Mountain, Washington
*Purple Peak, Colorado
=== Purple mountains phenomenon ===

It has been observed that the greater the distance between a viewers eyes and mountains, the lighter and more blue or purple they will appear. This phenomenon, long recognized by Leonardo da Vinci and other painters, is called aerial perspective or atmospheric perspective. The more distant the mountains are, the less contrast the eye sees between the mountains and the sky.

The bluish color is caused by an optical effect called Rayleigh scattering. The sunlit sky is blue because air scatters short-wavelength light more than longer wavelengths. Since blue light is at the short wavelength end of the visible spectrum, it is more strongly scattered in the atmosphere than long wavelength red light. The result is that the human eye perceives blue when looking toward parts of the sky other than the sun.

At sunrise and sunset, the light is passing through the atmosphere at a lower angle, and traveling a greater distance through a larger volume of air. Much of the green and blue is scattered away, and more red light comes to the eye, creating the colors of the sunrise and sunset and making the mountains look purple.

The phenomenon is referenced in the song &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;, where the lyrics refer to &quot;purple mountains&#x27; majesty&quot; among other features of the United States landscape. A Crayola crayon called Purple Mountain Majesty in reference to the lyric was first formulated in 1993.
== Mythology ==
Julius Pollux, a Greek grammarian who lived in the second century AD, attributed the discovery of purple to the Phoenician god and guardian of the city of Tyre, Heracles. According to his account, while walking along the shore with the nymph Tyrus, the god&#x27;s dog bit into a murex shell, causing his mouth to turn purple. The nymph subsequently requested that Heracles create a garment for her of that same color, with Heracles obliging her demands giving birth to Tyrian purple.

== Associations and symbolism ==
=== Royalty ===
In Europe, since some Roman emperors wore a Tyrian purple (&quot;purpura&quot;) toga praetexta, purple has been the color most associated with power and royalty. The British Royal Family and other European royalty still use it as a ceremonial color on special occasions. In Japan, purple is associated with the emperor and Japanese aristocracy.

=== Piety, faith, penitence, and theology ===
In the West, purple or violet is a color often associated with piety and religious faith. In AD 1464, shortly after the Muslim conquest of Constantinople, which terminated the supply of Tyrian purple to Roman Catholic Europe, Pope Paul II decreed that cardinals should henceforth wear scarlet instead of purple, the scarlet being dyed with expensive cochineal. Bishops were assigned the color amaranth, being a pale and pinkish purple made then from a less-expensive mixture of indigo and cochineal.

In the Latin liturgical rites of the Catholic liturgy, purple represents penitence; Anglican and Catholic priests wear a purple stole when they hear confession and a purple stole and chasuble during Advent and Lent. Since the Second Vatican Council of 1962–5, priests may wear purple vestments, but may still wear black ones, when officiating at funerals. The &quot;Roman Missal&quot; permits black, purple (violet), or white vestments for the funeral Mass. White is worn when a child dies before the age of reason. Students and faculty of theology also wear purple academic dress for graduations and other university ceremonies.

Purple is also often worn by senior pastors of Protestant churches and bishops of the Anglican Communion.

The color purple is also associated with royalty in Christianity, being one of the three traditional offices of Jesus Christ, i. e. king, although such a symbolism was assumed from the earlier Roman association or at least also employed by the ancient Romans.

=== Vanity, extravagance, individualism ===
In Europe and America, purple is the color most associated with vanity, extravagance, and individualism. Among the seven deadly sins, it represents pride. It is a color which is used to attract attention.

=== The artificial, materialism and beauty ===
Purple is the color most often associated with the artificial and the unconventional. It is the major color that occurs the least frequently in nature, and was the first color to be synthesized.

=== Ambiguity and ambivalence ===
Purple is the color most associated with ambiguity. Like other colors made by combining two primary colors, it is seen as uncertain and equivocal.

=== Mourning ===
In Britain, purple is sometimes associated with mourning. In Victorian times, close relatives wore black for the first year following a death (&quot;deep mourning&quot;), and then replaced it with purple or dark green trimmed with black. This is rarely practised today.

== In culture and society ==
=== Cultures of Asian countries ===
* The Chinese word for purple, &quot;zi&quot;, is connected with the North Star, Polaris, or &quot;zi Wei&quot; in Chinese. In Chinese astrology, the North Star was the home of the Celestial Emperor, the ruler of the heavens. The area around the North Star is called the Purple Forbidden Enclosure in Chinese astronomy. For that reason the Forbidden City in Beijing was also known as the Purple Forbidden City (&quot;zi Jin cheng&quot;). Purple often represents &quot;the highest,&quot; holiest, and &quot;most sacred values&quot; in China.
** In Taoism, purple is a transitional color and metaphysically between yin and yang.
*Purple was a popular color introduced into Japanese dress during the Heian period (794–1185). The dye was made from the root of the alkanet plant (&quot;Anchusa officinalis&quot;), also known as &quot;murasaki&quot; in Japanese. At about the same time, Japanese painters began to use a pigment made from the same plant.
*In Thailand, widows in mourning wear the color purple. Purple is also associated with Saturday on the Thai solar calendar.
=== Cultures of Europe ===

==== Ancient Rome ====
Purple represented the height of Roman virtue and cultural values.

==== Medieval Europe ====

* In medieval Europe, purple represented leadership and the king.
** In European alchemy during this time, &quot;the &#x27;precious purple tincture&#x27;&quot; was a term for various substances alchemists hoped to create. The term and goal of the alchemists evoked kingliness, since the divine right of kings was also thought to aid the alchemists&#x27; future.

*Wearing purple is a military slang expression in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. for an officer who is serving in a joint assignment with another service, such as an Army officer on assignment to the Navy.

=== Sexuality ===
Purple is sometimes associated with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community. It is the symbolic color worn on Spirit Day, a commemoration that began in 2010 to show support for young people who are bullied because of their sexual orientation. Purple is closely associated with bisexuality, largely in part to the bisexual pride flag which combines pink – representing homosexuality – and blue – representing heterosexuality – to create the bisexual purple. The purple hand is another symbol sometimes used by the LGBT community during parades and demonstrations.

<text>The unexpected hanging paradox or surprise test paradox is a paradox about a person&#x27;s expectations about the timing of a future event which they are told will occur at an unexpected time. The paradox is variously applied to a prisoner&#x27;s hanging or a surprise school test. It was first introduced to the public in Martin Gardner&#x27;s March 1963 Mathematical Games column in &quot;Scientific American&quot; magazine.

There is no consensus on its precise nature and consequently a canonical resolution has not been agreed on. Logical analyses focus on &quot;truth values&quot;, for example by identifying it as paradox of self-reference. Epistemological studies of the paradox instead focus on issues relating to &quot;knowledge&quot;; for example, one interpretation reduces it to Moore&#x27;s paradox. Some regard it as a &quot;significant problem&quot; for philosophy.

== Description ==
The paradox has been described as follows:

Other versions of the paradox replace the death sentence with a surprise fire drill, examination, pop quiz, A/B test launch, a lion behind a door, or a marriage proposal.

==Logical school==
Formulation of the judge&#x27;s announcement into formal logic is made difficult by the vague meaning of the word &quot;surprise&quot;. An attempt at formulation might be:

*&quot;The prisoner will be hanged next week and the date (of the hanging) will not be deducible the night before from the assumption that the hanging will occur during the week&quot; (A).

Given this announcement the prisoner can deduce that the hanging will not occur on the last day of the week. However, in order to reproduce the next stage of the argument, which eliminates the penultimate day of the week, the prisoner must argue that his ability to deduce, from statement (A), that the hanging will not occur on the last day, implies that a second-to-last-day hanging &quot;would not be surprising&quot;. But since the meaning of &quot;surprising&quot; has been restricted to &quot;not deducible from the assumption that the hanging will occur during the week&quot; instead of &quot;not deducible from statement (A)&quot;, the argument is blocked.

This suggests that a better formulation would in fact be:

*&quot;The prisoner will be hanged next week and its date will not be deducible the night before using this statement as an axiom&quot; (B).

Fitch has shown that this statement can still be expressed in formal logic. Using an equivalent form of the paradox which reduces the length of the week to just two days, he proved that although self-reference is not illegitimate in all circumstances, it is in this case because the statement is self-contradictory.

==Epistemological school==
Various epistemological formulations have been proposed that show that the prisoner&#x27;s tacit assumptions about what he will know in the future, together with several plausible assumptions about knowledge, are inconsistent.

Chow (1998) provides a detailed analysis of a version of the paradox in which a surprise hanging is to take place on one of two days. Applying Chow&#x27;s analysis to the case of the unexpected hanging (again with the week shortened to two days for simplicity), we start with the observation that the judge&#x27;s announcement seems to affirm three things:

* S1: &quot;The hanging will occur on Monday or Tuesday.&quot;
* S2: &quot;If the hanging occurs on Monday, then the prisoner will not know on Sunday evening that it will occur on Monday.&quot;
* S3: &quot;If the hanging occurs on Tuesday, then the prisoner will not know on Monday evening that it will occur on Tuesday.&quot;

As a first step, the prisoner reasons that a scenario in which the hanging occurs on Tuesday is impossible because it leads to a contradiction: on the one hand, by S3, the prisoner would not be able to predict the Tuesday hanging on Monday evening; but on the other hand, by S1 and process of elimination, the prisoner &quot;would&quot; be able to predict the Tuesday hanging on Monday evening.

Chow&#x27;s analysis points to a subtle flaw in the prisoner&#x27;s reasoning. What is impossible is not a Tuesday hanging. Rather, what is impossible is a situation in which &quot;the hanging occurs on Tuesday despite the prisoner knowing on Monday evening that the judge&#x27;s assertions S1, S2, and S3 are all true.&quot;

The prisoner&#x27;s reasoning, which gives rise to the paradox, is able to get off the ground because the prisoner tacitly assumes that on Monday evening, he will (if he is still alive) know S1, S2, and S3 to be true. This assumption seems unwarranted on several different grounds. It may be argued that the judge&#x27;s pronouncement that something is true can never be sufficient grounds for the prisoner &quot;knowing&quot; that it is true. Further, even if the prisoner knows something to be true in the present moment, unknown psychological factors may erase this knowledge in the future. Finally, Chow suggests that because the statement which the prisoner is supposed to &quot;know&quot; to be true is a statement about his &quot;inability&quot; to &quot;know&quot; certain things, there is reason to believe that the unexpected hanging paradox is simply a more intricate version of Moore&#x27;s paradox. A suitable analogy can be reached by reducing the length of the week to just one day. Then the judge&#x27;s sentence becomes: &quot;You will be hanged tomorrow, but you do not know that&quot;.

<text>Feldspar ( ; sometimes spelled felspar) is a group of rock-forming aluminium tectosilicate minerals, also containing other cations such as sodium, calcium, potassium, or barium. The most common members of the feldspar group are the &quot;plagioclase&quot; (sodium-calcium) feldspars and the &quot;alkali&quot; (potassium-sodium) feldspars. Feldspars make up about 60% of the Earth&#x27;s crust and 41% of the Earth&#x27;s continental crust by weight.

Feldspars crystallize from magma as both intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks and are also present in many types of metamorphic rock. Rock formed almost entirely of calcic plagioclase feldspar is known as anorthosite. Feldspars are also found in many types of sedimentary rocks.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;feldspar&quot; derives from the German , a compound of the words &quot;&quot; (&quot;field&quot;) and (&quot;flake&quot;). had long been used as the word for &quot;a rock easily cleaved into flakes&quot;; was introduced in the 18th century as a more specific term, referring perhaps to its common occurrence in rocks found in fields (Urban Brückmann, 1783) or to its occurrence as &quot;fields&quot; within granite and other minerals (René-Just Haüy, 1804).
The change from to &quot;-spar&quot; was influenced by the English word &quot;spar&quot;, meaning a non-opaque mineral with good cleavage. &quot;Feldspathic&quot; refers to materials that contain feldspar. The alternate spelling, &quot;felspar&quot;, has fallen out of use. The term &#x27;felsic&#x27;, meaning light coloured minerals such as quartz and feldspars, is an acronymic word derived from &quot;fel&quot;dspar and &quot;si&quot;lica, unrelated to the obsolete spelling &#x27;felspar&#x27;.

==Compositions==

The feldspar group of minerals consists of tectosilicates, silicate minerals in which silicon ions are linked by shared oxygen ions to form a three-dimensional network. Compositions of major elements in common feldspars can be expressed in terms of three endmembers:
* orthoclase endmember KAlSiO
* albite endmember NaAlSiO
* anorthite endmember CaAlSiO

Solid solutions between orthoclase and albite are called alkali feldspar. Solid solutions between albite and anorthite are called plagioclase, or, more properly, plagioclase feldspar. Only limited solid solution occurs between K-feldspar and anorthite, and in the two other solid solutions, immiscibility occurs at temperatures common in the crust of the Earth. Albite is considered both a plagioclase and alkali feldspar.
The ratio of alkali feldspar to plagioclase feldspar, together with the proportion of quartz, is the basis for the QAPF classification of igneous rock. Calcium-rich plagioclase is the first feldspar to crystallize from cooling magma, then the plagioclase becomes increasingly sodium-rich as crystallization continues. This defines the continuous Bowen&#x27;s reaction series. K-feldspar is the final feldspar to crystallize from the magma.

===Alkali feldspars===
Alkali feldspars are grouped into two types: those containing potassium in combination with sodium, aluminium, or silicon; and those where potassium is replaced by barium. The first of these include:
* orthoclase (monoclinic) 
* sanidine (monoclinic) 
* microcline (triclinic) 
* anorthoclase (triclinic) 

Potassium and sodium feldspars are not perfectly miscible in the melt at low temperatures, therefore intermediate compositions of the alkali feldspars occur only in higher temperature environments. Sanidine is stable at the highest temperatures, and microcline at the lowest. Perthite is a typical texture in alkali feldspar, due to exsolution of contrasting alkali feldspar compositions during cooling of an intermediate composition. The perthitic textures in the alkali feldspars of many granites can be seen with the naked eye. Microperthitic textures in crystals are visible using a light microscope, whereas cryptoperthitic textures can be seen only with an electron microscope.

===Ammonium feldspar===
Buddingtonite is an ammonium feldspar with the chemical formula: NH4AlSi3O8. It is a mineral associated with hydrothermal alteration of the primary feldspar minerals.

===Barium feldspars===
Barium feldspars form as the result of the substitution of barium for potassium in the mineral structure. Barium feldspars are sometimes classified as a separate group of feldspars, and sometimes they are classified as a sub-group of alkali feldspars.

The barium feldspars are monoclinic and include the following:
* celsian 
* hyalophane 

===Plagioclase feldspars===

The plagioclase feldspars are triclinic. The plagioclase series follows (with percent anorthite in parentheses):
* albite (0 to 10) 
* oligoclase (10 to 30) 
* andesine (30 to 50) 
* labradorite (50 to 70) 
* bytownite (70 to 90) 
* anorthite (90 to 100) 

Intermediate compositions of exsolve to two feldspars of contrasting composition during cooling, but diffusion is much slower than in alkali feldspar, and the resulting two-feldspar intergrowths typically are too fine-grained to be visible with optical microscopes. The immiscibility gaps in the plagioclase solid solutions are complex compared to the gap in the alkali feldspars. The play of colours visible in some feldspar of labradorite composition is due to very fine-grained exsolution lamellae known as Bøggild intergrowth. The specific gravity in the plagioclase series increases from albite (2.62) to anorthite (2.72–2.75).

==Structure==
The structure of a feldspar crystal is based on aluminosilicate tetrahedra. Each tetrahedron consists of an aluminium or silicon ion surrounded by four oxygen ions. Each oxygen ion, in turn, is shared by a neighbouring tetrahedron to form a three-dimensional network. The structure can be visualized as long chains of aluminosilicate tetrahedra, sometimes described as crankshaft chains because their shape is kinked. Each crankshaft chain links to neighbouring crankshaft chains to form a three-dimensional network of fused four-member rings. The structure is open enough for cations (typically sodium, potassium, or calcium) to fit into the structure and provide charge balance. 
==Weathering==
Chemical weathering of feldspars happens by hydrolysis and produces clay minerals, including illite, smectite, and kaolinite. Hydrolysis of feldspars begins with the feldspar dissolving in water, which happens best in acidic or basic solutions and less well in neutral ones. The speed at which feldspars are weathered is controlled by how quickly they are dissolved. Dissolved feldspar reacts with H+ or OH− ions and precipitates clays. The reaction also produces new ions in solution, with the variety of ions controlled by the type of feldspar reacting.

The abundance of feldspars in the Earth&#x27;s crust means that clays are very abundant weathering products. About 40% of minerals in sedimentary rocks are clays and clays are the dominant minerals in the most common sedimentary rocks, mudrocks. They are also an important component of soils. Feldspar that has been replaced by clay looks chalky compared to more crystalline and glassy unweathered feldspar grains.

Feldspars, especially plagioclase feldspars, are not very stable at the Earth&#x27;s surface due to their high formation temperature. This lack of stability is why feldspars are easily weathered to clays. Because of this tendency to weather easily, feldspars are usually not prevalent in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks that contain large amounts of feldspar indicate that the sediment did not undergo much chemical weathering before being buried. This means it was probably transported a short distance in cold and/or dry conditions that did not promote weathering, and that it was quickly buried by other sediment. Sandstones with large amounts of feldspar are called arkoses.

==Applications==
Feldspar is a common raw material used in glassmaking, ceramics, and to some extent as filler and an extender in paint, plastics, and rubber. In the US, about 66% of feldspar is consumed in glassmaking, including glass containers and glass fibre. Ceramics (including electrical insulators, sanitaryware, tableware and tile) and other uses, such as fillers, accounted for the remainder.

Glass: Feldspar provides both K2O and Na2O for fluxing, and Al2O3 and CaO as stabilizers. As an important source of Al2O3 for glassmaking, feldspar is valued for its low iron and
refractory mineral content, a low cost per unit of Al2O3, no volatiles and no waste.

Ceramics: Feldspars are used in the ceramic industry as a flux to form a glassy phase in bodies during firing, and thus promote vitrification. They also are used as a source of alkalies and alumina in glazes. The composition of feldspar used in different ceramic formulations varies depending on various factors, including the properties of the individual grade, the other raw materials and the requirements of the finished products. However, typical additions include: tableware, 15% to 30% feldspar; high-tension electrical porcelains, 25% to 35%; sanitaryware, 25%; wall tile, 0% to 10%; and dental porcelain up to 80% feldspar.

Earth sciences: In earth sciences and archaeology, feldspars are used for potassium-argon dating, argon-argon dating and luminescence dating.

Minor use: Some household cleaners (such as Bar Keepers Friend and Bon Ami) use feldspar to give a mild abrasive action.

==Production==
The USGS estimated global production of feldspar in 2020 to be 26 million tonnes, with the top four producing countries being: China 2 million tonnes; India 5 million tonnes; Italy 4 million; Turkey 7.6 million tonnes.

===Commercial grades===
Typical mineralogical and chemical analyses of three commercial grades used in ceramics are:
==Extraterrestrial==
In October 2012, the &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover found high feldspar content in a Mars rock.

<doc id="37956" wikidata="Q186094" url="?curid=37956" title="Best, worst and average case">
<text>In computer science, best, worst, and average cases of a given algorithm express what the resource usage is &quot;at least&quot;, &quot;at most&quot; and &quot;on average&quot;, respectively. Usually the resource being considered is running time, i.e. time complexity, but could also be memory or some other resource.
Best case is the function which performs the minimum number of steps on input data of n elements. Worst case is the function which performs the maximum number of steps on input data of size n. Average case is the function which performs an average number of steps on input data of n elements.

In real-time computing, the worst-case execution time is often of particular concern since it is important to know how much time might be needed &quot;in the worst case&quot; to guarantee that the algorithm will always finish on time.

Average performance and worst-case performance are the most used in algorithm analysis. Less widely found is best-case performance, but it does have uses: for example, where the best cases of individual tasks are known, they can be used to improve the accuracy of an overall worst-case analysis. Computer scientists use probabilistic analysis techniques, especially expected value, to determine expected running times.

The terms are used in other contexts; for example the worst- and best-case outcome of an epidemic, worst-case temperature to which an electronic circuit element is exposed, etc. Where components of specified tolerance are used, devices must be designed to work properly with the worst-case combination of tolerances and external conditions.

== Best-case performance for algorithm ==
The term &quot;best-case performance&quot; is used in computer science to describe an algorithm&#x27;s behavior under optimal conditions. For example, the best case for a simple linear search on a list occurs when the desired element is the first element of the list.

Development and choice of algorithms is rarely based on best-case performance: most academic and commercial enterprises are more interested in improving average-case complexity and worst-case performance. Algorithms may also be trivially modified to have good best-case running time by hard-coding solutions to a finite set of inputs, making the measure almost meaningless.

== Worst-case versus amortized versus average-case performance ==


Worst-case performance analysis and average-case performance analysis have some similarities, but in practice usually require different tools and approaches.

Determining what &quot;typical input&quot; means is difficult, and often that average input has properties which make it difficult to characterise mathematically (consider, for instance, algorithms that are designed to operate on strings of text). Similarly, even when a sensible description of a particular &quot;average case&quot; (which will probably only be applicable for some uses of the algorithm) is possible, they tend to result in more difficult analysis of equations.

Worst-case analysis gives a &quot;safe&quot; analysis (the worst case is never underestimated), but one which can be overly &quot;pessimistic&quot;, since there may be no (realistic) input that would take this many steps.

In some situations it may be necessary to use a pessimistic analysis in order to guarantee safety. Often however, a pessimistic analysis may be too pessimistic, so an analysis that gets closer to the real value but may be optimistic (perhaps with some known low probability of failure) can be a much more practical approach. One modern approach in academic theory to bridge the gap between worst-case and average-case analysis is called smoothed analysis.

When analyzing algorithms which often take a small time to complete, but periodically require a much larger time, amortized analysis can be used to determine the worst-case running time over a (possibly infinite) series of operations. This amortized cost can be much closer to the average cost, while still providing a guaranteed upper limit on the running time. So e.g. online algorithms are frequently based on amortized analysis.

The worst-case analysis is related to the worst-case complexity.

== Practical consequences ==
Many algorithms with bad worst-case performance have good average-case performance. For problems we want to solve, this is a good thing: we can hope that the particular instances we care about are average. For cryptography, this is very bad: we want typical instances of a cryptographic problem to be hard. Here methods like random self-reducibility can be used for some specific problems to show that the worst case is no harder than the average case, or, equivalently, that the average case is no easier than the worst case.

On the other hand, some data structures like hash tables have very poor worst-case behaviors, but a well written hash table of sufficient size will statistically never give the worst case; the average number of operations performed follows an exponential decay curve, and so the run time of an operation is statistically bounded.

== Examples ==
=== Sorting algorithms ===

* Insertion sort applied to a list of &quot;n&quot; elements, assumed to be all different and initially in random order. On average, half the elements in a list &quot;A&quot;1 ... &quot;A&quot;&quot;j&quot; are less than element &quot;A&quot;&quot;j&quot;+1, and half are greater. Therefore, the algorithm compares the (&quot;j&quot; + 1)th element to be inserted on the average with half the already sorted sub-list, so &quot;t&quot;&quot;j&quot; = &quot;j&quot;/2. Working out the resulting average-case running time yields a quadratic function of the input size, just like the worst-case running time.
* Quicksort applied to a list of &quot;n&quot; elements, again assumed to be all different and initially in random order. This popular sorting algorithm has an average-case performance of O(&quot;n&quot; log(&quot;n&quot;)), which contributes to making it a very fast algorithm in practice. But given a worst-case input, its performance degrades to O(&quot;n&quot;2). Also, when implemented with the &quot;shortest first&quot; policy, the worst-case space complexity is instead bounded by O(log(&quot;n&quot;)).
* Heapsort has O(n) time when all elements are the same. Heapify takes O(n) time and then removing elements from the heap is O(1) time for each of the n elements. The run time grows to O(nlog(n)) if all elements must be distinct.
* Bogosort has O(n) time when the elements are sorted on the first iteration. In each iteration all elements are checked if in order. There are n! possible permutations; with a balanced random number generator, almost each permutation of the array is yielded in n! iterations. Computers have limited memory, so the generated numbers cycle; it might not be possible to reach each permutation. In the worst case this leads to O(∞) time, an infinite loop.
=== Data structures ===
* Linear search on a list of &quot;n&quot; elements. In the absolute worst case, the search must visit every element once. This happens when the value being searched for is either the last element in the list, or is not in the list. However, on average, assuming the value searched for is in the list and each list element is equally likely to be the value searched for, the search visits only &quot;n&quot;/2 elements.

<doc id="37958" wikidata="Q887730" url="?curid=37958" title="Newcastle Brown Ale">
<text>Newcastle Brown Ale is a brown ale, originally brewed in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. It was launched in 1927 by Colonel Jim Porter after three years of development. The 1960 merger of Newcastle Breweries with Scottish Brewers afforded the beer national distribution, and UK sales peaked in the early 1970s. The beer underwent a resurgence in the late 1980s and early 1990s with student unions selling it. Brewing moved in 2005 from Newcastle to Dunston, Tyne and Wear, and in 2010 to Tadcaster. In 2017, the Heineken Brewery in Zoeterwoude, Netherlands, also began production. Since 2019, it has also been brewed by Lagunitas Brewing Company in Petaluma, California, and Chicago, Illinois, for the American market.

Newcastle Brown Ale is perceived in the UK as a working-man&#x27;s beer, with a long association with heavy industry: the traditional economic staple of the North East of England. In export markets, it is seen as a trendy, premium import, being predominantly drunk by the young. It was one of the first beers to be distributed in a clear glass bottle and is most readily associated with this form of bottle in the United Kingdom.

==History==

===Tyne Brewery, Newcastle===
Newcastle Brown Ale was originally created by Lieutenant Colonel James (&#x27;Jim&#x27;) Herbert Porter (b. 1892, Burton upon Trent), a third-generation brewer at Newcastle Breweries, in 1927. Porter had served in the North Staffordshire Regiment in the First World War, earning his DSO with Bar, before moving to Newcastle. Porter had refined the recipe for Newcastle Brown Ale alongside chemist Archie Jones over a period of three years. When Porter actually completed the beer, he believed it to be a failure, as he had actually been attempting to recreate Bass ale. The original beer had an original gravity of 1060º and was 6.25 ABV, and it sold at a premium price of 9 shillings for a dozen pint bottles.

Newcastle Brown Ale went into production at Tyne Brewery in 1927, with Newcastle Breweries having occupied the site since 1890, and brewing on the site dating back to 1868.

The blue star logo was introduced to the Newcastle Brown Ale bottle in 1928, the year after the beer was launched. The five points of the star represent the five founding breweries of Newcastle.

After the merger of Scottish Brewers with Newcastle Breweries in 1960, Newcastle Brown Ale became a flagship brand of Scottish &amp; Newcastle alongside McEwan&#x27;s Export and Younger&#x27;s Tartan Special.

By 1997, Scottish and Newcastle claimed that it was the most widely distributed alcoholic product in both pubs and off licences in the country.

===Move to Federation Brewery, Gateshead===
Despite investing £16.6 million in a new bottling plant at the Tyne Brewery in 1999, Scottish and Newcastle announced its closure on 22 April 2004, in order to consolidate the brewing of beer and ale at the Federation Brewery site in Dunston, Gateshead, which was to pass to them with their £7.2m purchase of the Federation Brewery. The purchase and consolidation at Dunston created the new brewing company, Newcastle Federation Breweries.

The last production run of Brown Ale in Newcastle came off the Tyne Brewery line in May 2005. Pre-production trial brews were conducted at Dunston to ensure there was no change in its taste after the move.

The Tyne Brewery site was bought by a consortium of Newcastle University, Newcastle City Council, and the regional development agency One NorthEast, as part of the wider Newcastle Science City project. Demolition of the former brewery began on 8 March 2007. The triggering of the controlled demolition of the former Barrack Road bottling plant opposite St James&#x27; Park was ceremonially performed by Sir Bobby Robson on 22 June 2008.

===Move to John Smith&#x27;s Brewery, Tadcaster===
Bottling of Newcastle Brown Ale moved to the John Smith&#x27;s Brewery in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, in 2007.

Heineken bought Scottish and Newcastle in a joint deal with Carlsberg in 2008.

In 2010, Scottish and Newcastle closed the Dunston brewery, moving production of Brown Ale to the John Smiths Brewery in Tadcaster. The company cited the general fall in the market for beer, over-capacity in its plants in general, and the fact that the Dunston site was operating at just 60% capacity—despite the fact that sales of Newcastle Brown Ale had never been higher—as reasons for the closure.

In 2015, the caramel colouring, which has been used since the beer was launched, was removed for health reasons. Instead, roasted malt was used to darken the beer.

===Move to Zoeterwoude Brewery, the Netherlands===
In 2017, Heineken moved some production from the John Smith&#x27;s Brewery, Tadcaster, to the Zoeterwoude Brewery in the Netherlands. The company claimed this would allow for shorter order lead times and faster transportation to the U.S. and allow distributors to purchase by the pallet rather than the container. In 2019, the company started making a different version in America and ceased importing Brown Ale from Europe. Newcastle Brown Ale is still brewed in Tadcaster, Yorkshire, for the UK and some EU markets, and also in the Netherlands for the export market. Lagunitas Brewing Company (a Heineken subsidiary) produces a product named Newcastle Brown Ale for the US domestic market. The recipe for this variation has a noticeably different taste compared to the original.

==Production and distribution==
Newcastle Brown Ale is brewed with pale malt and crystal malt. It has a lower hopping rate than traditional English bitters.

The beer is one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s leading bottled ales and is in the top 20 highest-selling ales overall, selling around annually. At the time of brewing moving to Dunston in 2005, Newcastle Brown was being exported to 41 countries. At times, over half of the brewery&#x27;s output is directed overseas to the U.S. In 2010, more than of the beer were sold in the United States, more than double the 2001 total. Newcastle Brown Ale is no longer available in the United States. A product labelled “Newcastle Brown Ale” is still sold but it is produced by Lagunitas Brewing Company and has little in common with the original product.

In Canada and France (Brittany), the beer is available in short and tall bottles and in cans. The beer is also available in British-themed pubs as a draught beer in Australia and New Zealand, brewed in the UK and imported by World Brands Australia Pty Ltd. The UK-brewed bottled, kegs, and cans are widely available in Australian liquor outlets as part of their international range. It is also popular in Canada, available on draught at many British-themed pubs.

==Names and phrases==

In 2000, the beer was renamed &quot;Newcastle Brown&quot; with the &quot;Ale&quot; being removed from the front label. This change, only in the UK, was due to market research claiming that the term &quot;ale&quot; was outdated and costing the company sales in the youth drinking markets. The older name was reinstated with no fanfare in 2004, when it was realised that the change had made no difference to sales.

In the North East, Newcastle Brown Ale is often given the nickname &quot;Dog&quot;, alluding to the British euphemism of seeing a man about a dog. It is also known as Broon, &quot;brown&quot; pronounced in the Geordie dialect. Elsewhere in the UK, it is known as Newkie Brown.

==Serving==

Newcastle Brown Ale is traditionally sold in Britain in and, more recently, bottles. Typically, the ale is consumed from a Wellington glass. This allows the drinker to regularly top-up the beer and thereby maintain a frothy &quot;head&quot;. In the United States, it is sold in servings. In April 2010, Heineken USA introduced the Wellington glass, branded as the &quot;Geordie Schooner,&quot; for Newcastle Brown Ale consumers in America. The glass features a nucleated base.

==Association with the North East==
Like many British breweries, Newcastle Brown is strongly associated with its local area, in this case north east England. While the name provides a lot of this, the sponsorship of Newcastle United and the depiction of the River Tyne in the blue star has helped ensure its association. Its local provenance gave the brand an association with &quot;hardy, working class traditions and values&quot;.

Under European Union Protected Geographical Status laws introduced in 1992, the name Newcastle Brown Ale was registered as a Protected Geographical Indication in 2000. In 2007, this was removed when brewing of the beer moved away from its place of origin to Tadcaster in Yorkshire. The company was not obliged to make a formal application to cancel it, but not move its production outside the area designated in its PGI application years before.

The closure of S&amp;N&#x27;s Dunston brewery in 2010 left Camerons Brewery in Hartlepool as the only remaining significant volume brewery in the North East of England.

==Variations==
===Special editions===
When the Australian brewer Elders IXL launched a takeover bid for Scottish and Newcastle, locals of Newcastle began the &quot;Keep Us on Top!&quot; campaign. As a sign of solidarity, the Newcastle Brown label was inverted until the takeover was quashed.

In 2005, the last 3,000 bottles produced in Newcastle were given commemorative labels &quot;121 years of brewing history, last bottles produced at Tyne Brewery April 2005.&quot; and given to the brewery staff.

In 2006, a special production run of 2.5 million bottles celebrated the career of Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer, who had recently broken the club&#x27;s scoring record and was about to retire from football. The brewery produced the special editions featuring Newcastle United&#x27;s black and white stripes and Shearer&#x27;s portrait, in exchange for a donation to Shearer&#x27;s testimonial match, and they went on sale from 17 April that year.

In 2007, a special edition was released to celebrate local rock band Maxïmo Park. The label was designed by the band and the beer released to coincide with the band&#x27;s concert at Newcastle Metro Radio Arena on 15 December. Also in 2007, a special 80th anniversary themed bottle was distributed.

In 2013, Newcastle partnered with Taxi Magic to brew a Black Ale called &quot;Newcastle Cabbie&quot; as part of an Anti-Drunk Driving campaign.

===Other Newcastle brands===
Newcastle Exhibition is a draught pasteurised keg beer (4.3% ABV) first introduced in 1929 and commonly found around the Newcastle area.

Newcastle Amber Ale (1032 OG) was a light ale available until the 1980s. It was a diluted version of Exhibition. Amber Ale and a much stronger aged stock beer were formerly blended to create Newcastle Brown Ale. This method was discontinued sometime before the brand was moved to Dunston.

Newcastle Star was a strong bottled beer (7.5% ABV) available from 1999 to 2006.

In 2010, Heineken USA launched Newcastle Summer Ale in bottles. In 2011, Heineken USA launched Newcastle Werewolf (fall ale) and Winter IPA. In 2012, Heineken USA will introduce Newcastle Founders ale (an Extra Special Bitter style) as their spring seasonal.

In 2012, Summer Ale (4.4%) and Founder&#x27;s Ale (4.8%) were launched in Tesco across the UK.

In winter 2012, Newcastle winter ale (5.2%) and Newcastle nocturnal ale (4.5%) were also launched in Tesco stores across the UK.

<doc id="37960" wikidata="Q659012" url="?curid=37960" title="United Nations Economic Commission for Europe">
<text>The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (ECE or UNECE) is one of the five regional commissions under the jurisdiction of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It was established in order to promote economic cooperation and integration among its member states.

The commission is composed of 56 member states, most of which are based in Europe, as well as a few outside of Europe. Its transcontinental Eurasian or non-European member states include: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Canada, Cyprus, Georgia, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, the United States of America and Uzbekistan.

== History ==
The commission was first proposed in London in the summer of 1946 by the Temporary Subcommission on the Reconstruction of Devastated Areas.

The commission was established by the Economic and Social Council on 28 March 1947 in order to &quot;Initiate and participate in measures for facilitating concerted action for the economic reconstruction of Europe,&quot; as well as to &quot;maintain and strengthen the economic relations of the European countries, both among themselves and with other countries of the world.&quot;

It was established at the request of the United Nations General Assembly who called on the Economic and Social Council to create the commission, as well as the Commission for Asia and the Far East, in order to &quot;give effective aid to countries devastated by war.&quot;

ECE absorbed the function and resources of the European Central Inland Transport Organization upon its founding.

As the commission was established towards the beginning of the Cold War, it faced difficulties in achieving its mandate of economic reconstruction of Europe due to the Iron Curtain: separately the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation was established in 1948 in the west and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance in 1949 in the east. The work of the commission had to concern itself only with questions that were of common interest to East and West, as to not cause confrontation. However, since the fall of the Soviet Union, the economic commissions of the United Nations have been expanding their activities in the former Soviet republics.

==Member states==

The following are the member states of the commission, along with their date of admission: 


== Committees and programmes ==
=== Committee on Environmental Policy ===
The concern of UNECE with problems of the environment dates back at least to 1971, when the group of Senior Advisors to the UNECE governments on environmental issues was created which led to the establishment of the Committee on Environmental Policy, which now meets annually. The Committee provides collective policy direction in the area of environment and sustainable development, prepares ministerial meetings, develops international environmental law and supports international initiatives in the region. CEP works to support countries to enhance their environmental governance and transboundary cooperation as well as strengthen implementation of the UNECE regional environmental commitments and advance sustainable development in the region.

Its main aim is to assess countries&#x27; efforts to reduce their overall pollution burden and manage their natural resources, to integrate environmental and socioeconomic policies, to strengthen cooperation with the international community, to harmonize environmental conditions and policies throughout the region and to stimulate greater involvement of the public and environmental discussions and decision-making.

CEP is the overall governing body of UNECE environmental activities. The committee&#x27;s work is based on several strategic pillars: 
* Providing the secretariat to the &quot;Environment for Europe&quot; process and participating in the regional promotion of Agenda 21; 
* Developing and carrying-out of UNECE Environmental Performance Reviews in the UNECE countries non-members of OECD;
* Overseeing UNECE activities on environmental monitoring, assessment and reporting;
* Increasing the overall effectiveness of UNECE multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) and facilitating the exchange of experience on MEAs&#x27; implementation. See UNECE Espoo Convention, Aarhus Convention, Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution, Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes and Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents.
* Participating and/or facilitating the exchange of experience in a number of cross-sectoral activities undertaken under the leadership of UNECE (e.g. education for sustainable development, transport, health and environment, green building), or in partnership with other organizations (e.g. environment and security initiative, European environment and health process).

=== Committee on Forests and the Forest Industry ===
The first task of UNECE after the Second World War was to coordinate reconstruction effort in Europe. Timber was crucial for construction, and energy, but the forests had been heavily overcut and production and trade were at a standstill. The ECE Timber Committee emerged from the International Timber Conference held in 1947 in Mariánské Lázně in the former Czechoslovakia.

The main pillars of the committee&#x27;s activities have been: the collection and publication of the best available statistics on forests, wood production and trade; the exchange of information on forest working techniques and training of forest workers; periodic surveys of the long-term outlook on forests; technical work on the rational use of wood; reviewing forest product markets; and share experiences on forest and forest sector policy.

=== Committee on Urban Development, Housing and Land Management ===
In 1947, UNECE set up a Panel on Housing Problems, which later evolved into the Committee on Human Settlements and after the reform in 2005/2006 into the Committee on Housing and Land Management. The committee is an intergovernmental body of all UNECE member States. It provides a forum for the compilation, dissemination and exchange of information and experience on housing, urban development, and land administration policies; and in areas such as Birmingham, a more fiscal issue-UK.

In 2020, the CUDHLM created the Forum of Mayors at the Palais des Nations, an event allowing mayors from the UNECE region to exchange their best practices on urban development, housing and land management. UNECE is the first UN Regional Economic Commission to implement such an initiative that facilitates the cooperation between the UN, Member States and cities.

=== Inland Transport Committee ===
The UNECE Transport Division has been providing secretariat services to the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations (WP.29).
In addition to acting as secretariat to the World Forum, the Vehicle Regulations and Transport Innovations section serves as the secretariat of the Administrative Committee for the coordination of work, and of the administrative/executives committees of the three agreements on vehicles administered by the World Forum.

Among other things, ITC has produced:
* 59 United Nations conventions concerning inland transport,
* Trans-European North-South Motorways, Trans-European Railways and the Euro-Asia Transport Links projects
* the TIR system (Transports Internationaux Routiers), a global customs transit facilitation solution
* transport statistics methods.

The World Forum services three UN Agreements:
* the 1958 Agreement on the approval/certification of Vehicles and its annexed UN Regulations,
* the 1997 Agreement on Periodic Technical Inspections (PTI) and its annexed UN Rules,
* and the 1998 Agreement on Global Technical Regulations and its annexed UN GTRs.

=== Statistical Division ===
The UNECE Statistical Division provides the secretariat for the Conference and its expert groups, and implements the statistical work programme of UNECE. The Conference brings together chief statisticians from national and international statistical organizations around the world, meaning that the word &quot;European&quot; in its name is no longer an accurate description of its geographical coverage. The Statistical Division helps member countries to strengthen their statistical systems, and coordinates international statistical activities in the UNECE region and beyond through the Conference and its Bureau, and the Database of International Statistical Activities. The Statistical Division develops guidelines and training materials on statistical methodology and practices, in response to demands from member countries. It works with different groups of specialists from national and international statistical organizations, and organizes meetings and online forums for statistical experts to exchange experiences on a wide range of topics. The UNECE Statistical Division also provides technical assistance to South-East European, East European, Caucasus and Central Asian countries.

The division also provides:

# On-line data on the 56 UNECE member countries in Europe, Central Asia and North America in both English and Russian, on economic, gender, forestry and transport statistics.
# A biennial overview of key statistics for member countries.
# A set of wikis to support collaboration activities and disseminate information about good practices.

UNECE conducted the in the 1990s in 23 member States, with over 150,000 participants, with hundreds of resulting scientific publications. This activity has hence continued in the form of the Generations and Gender Programme.

=== Sustainable Energy Division ===
The Sustainable Energy Division supports the UN&#x27;s energy program, including security of energy supply, economics, and environmental protection, in the areas of energy efficiency, renewable energy, clean electricity, natural gas, coal, and resource classification. It is the secretariat responsible for Committee on Sustainable Energy and various expert groups supporting access to affordable and clean energy for all, as well as help reduce greenhouse gas emissions of the energy sector in the region.

The Expert Group on Resource Management created the United Nations Framework Classification for Resources, the first widely accepted natural resource management system for classifying, managing, and reporting energy, mineral, and raw material resources in the world.

=== United Smart Cities (USC) ===

The United Smart Cities programme is a joint effort between UNECE and the Organization for International Economic Relations (OiER).

Numerous private business entities and other international and European agencies support the programme, including Environment Agency Austria (EAA), the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), UN-Habitat, and the International Society of City and Regional Planners (ISOCARP). The programme promotes areas of strategic smart city policy and development. The key focus areas as detailed by the programme are:

# Urban mobility
# Sustainable housing
# Clean energy
# Waste management
# Information and Communications Technology (ICT)

==Secretariat==
The ECE secretariat has been characterized as a &quot;strong&quot; secretariat. The ECE secretariat was led by Gunnar Myrdal in its first decade. Myrdal refused efforts by the Soviet Union to dictate what staff would be employed in the secretariat. During this period, the secretariat sought to promote European integration efforts.

<doc id="37963" wikidata="Q488981" url="?curid=37963" title="European Bank for Reconstruction and Development">
<text>The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD; [[French language|French]]: &quot;Banque européenne pour la reconstruction et le développement, BERD&quot;) is an international financial institution founded in 1991. As a multilateral developmental investment bank, the EBRD uses investment as a tool to build market economies.

Initially focused on the countries of the former Eastern Bloc it expanded to support development in more than 30 countries from Central Europe to Central Asia. Similar to other multilateral development banks, the EBRD has members from all over the world (North America, Africa, Asia and Australia, see below), with the biggest single shareholder being the United States, but only lends regionally in its countries of operations. Headquartered in London, the EBRD is owned by 73 countries and two European Union institutions, the newest shareholder being Algeria since October 2021. Despite its public sector shareholders, it invests in private enterprises, together with commercial partners.

The EBRD is not to be confused with the European Investment Bank (EIB), which is owned by EU member states and is used to support EU policy. EBRD is also distinct from the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB).

== History of the EBRD ==
Located in London, the EBRD was intended at its beginning to focus on the switch from centrally planned economy to market based economy in the Central and Eastern European countries by investing in the private sector, mainly banks, industries and businesses, and by promoting policies that would favor them. It was created as a result of the end of the Cold War because of particular issues regarding the international system in place, the historical and political context at the time. Furthermore, its recipient countries had to ensure that they would work towards &quot;multi-party democracy and political pluralism&quot; in which was considered as one of the main particularity of the EBRD distinguishing the latter from other financial institutions. Firstly, notably advocated by European political actors such as the French President Mitterrand in 1989, the idea of creating this financial institution involving the European countries started before the fall of the Berlin Wall. The reception of this proposition was mitigated depending on the country, for instance it received hostility from the British whereas the French were important proponents of the project and influenced the process. In January 1990, negotiations about the EBRD objectives, its lending policy regarding the public and private sectors, started and involved all the EU countries at the time, as well as various other European countries, non-European countries and representatives from the EU and the European Investment Bank. The Soviet Union was represented by its own delegation in the process and thus participated in the negotiations as well as the USA. Later on, because of dissensions on the political and economic objectives of the institution, the inclusion of the Soviet Union was threatened. Considered as short negotiations, the agreement (for reasons relating to the situation in Eastern Europe and to a wave of privatization across Europe) leading to its creation was signed on 29 May 1990 by actors such as 40 states as well as two European organizations and by March 1991 took its first effects as the bank was inaugurated. The creation of the EBRD has led to the financing of various projects in the years following its first operations, for instance there were twenty projects in 1992 in which the EBRD provided financing worth ECU 2.1 billion.

== Governance ==
Divided between its headquarters located in London, and field offices located elsewhere, the European Bank for reconstruction and development is made of a three-tier structure composed of firstly, the president and the staff, secondly the Board of Governors and finally the Board of Directors. The bank’s structure has changed over time, because of concerns about competition within the institution. In fact, in the beginning of the 90s, there were two different banking divisions (on one side, the merchant banking related to the private sector and on the other side the development banking side working mostly with the public sector). Consequently, the two divisions came to be merged into a single one, substituting this structure with another one instead dividing the bank with seven policy and country regional sub-divisions.

=== Board of Governors ===
Representatives from each member state compose this board, they have authority power.

=== Board of Directors ===
The Board of Directors consists of 23 members elected by the Board of Governors. These members can not be on the Board of Governors. Its function is to direct the general operations of the bank, notably:

* Approve the budget; 
* In accordance with the Board of Governors, establishing policies and making other decisions, loans, investments;
* Prepare the work of the Board of Governors;
* Submit yearly for approval the audited accounts to the Board of Governors.

=== President ===
The EBRD is composed of many members with voting powers, from European and non-European states to the membership of other institutions such as the European Investment Bank, however depending on the geographical location of each member, voting rights differ. More precisely, European and other creditor members hold a majority voting power. At its beginning, the EBRD was owned by more than 40 members, in 2015 the number of countries owning it was 61. and as of March 2022, there were 71 countries as owners.

The following presidents have served the EBRD to date (as of March 2022).

* Jacques Attali: April 1991 – June 1993
* Jacques de Larosière: September 1993 – January 1998
* Horst Köhler: September 1998 – April 2000
* Jean Lemierre: July 2000 – July 2008
* Thomas Mirow: July 2008 – July 2012
* Suma Chakrabarti: July 2012 – July 2020
* Odile Renaud-Basso: 2020 – &quot;present&quot;

=== Membership ===
To become a member of the bank, a country needs to fit the EBRD&#x27;s Articles of Agreement. These Articles stipulate that a country can only become a Member State if it is a state in Europe or a non-European member of the IMF. Institutions like the European Union and the EIB also participate in the bank operations. Since its foundation the EBRD has almost doubled in membership size. The latest accessions to the bank are countries located in Africa.

=== Shareholders ===

== Public banking ==
The EBRD is a public bank, meaning that public institutions such as states are shareholders in those institutions. More precisely, public financial institutions are controlled major predominantly by public authorities (more than 50%) whereas in institutions with public participations, public authorities aren&#x27;t majority shareholders. Public banks were particularly involved in the economic transition of the former Soviet Republics and Central and Eastern European countries as private banks and other sources of financing didn&#x27;t want to invest for reasons such as those countries’ macroeconomic difficulties as well as political reasons regarding the country’s stability for instance.

=== Relationship with the EIB ===
In the context of the EU’s investment banking, the EBRD and the EIB have been involved in a rivalry regarding the status of the “EU’s premier development bank”. Major criticism about the EBRD in this situation is related to the fact that non-EU countries are also important shareholders whereas the EIB is completely owned by the EU. More recently, another source of rivalry was about becoming the new “European Climate and Sustainable Development Bank (ECSDB).

=== Public banks and the COVID-19 pandemic ===
More recently, since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, public banks have had their influence and role increased as they have become important actors of the economic recovery response. As for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, it has committed €21 billion between 2020 and 2021 of activities. More precisely, its own package was established within the scope of the Resilience Framework, the Trade Facilitation Programme and the Vital Infrastructure Support Programme etc. In 2020 alone, it has invested €11 billion as part of 411 projects which corresponds to a 10% raison compared to 2019. 72% of its investments were received by the private sector. Moreover, because of this specific context, the EBRD focused some of its operations in sectors other than green investment meaning that it only focused 29% of its investment in this domain (compared to 46% in 2019).

== Financing ==

=== Donors ===
According to the EBRD 2020 Sustainability Report, donors provided €589 million to support EBRD activities, taking the form of grants, loans and risk-mitigating instruments.

The EBRD funds come mainly from bilateral donors, from the Climate Investment Funds (CIF), the European Union (EU), the Global Environment Facility (GEF), and the Green Climate Fund (GCF).

=== Financial operations ===
According to the EBRD, the bank provides different direct financial instruments such as loans, equity investments and guarantees. It also works on the assistance of SMEs through the intermediary of other banks or investment and venture capital funds which are linked to the EBRD’s investments.

=== Steps leading to a loan ===
Each project is analysed, first by the EBRD management with the negotiations and the subsequent signing of a mandate letter drafting the important information about the project plan, the expected expenses as well as the responsibilities. Secondly, the project is to be finally reviewed by the management. Later on, it is submitted to the Board of Directors for approval. After being signed for both parties, it becomes legally binding. It leads to the transfer of funds from the EBRD to the client which will in the future start to repay the bank’s loan.

==Environmental sustainability==
The EBRD is unique among development banks for two reasons. First, it was the first multilateral development bank to have an explicit environmental mandate in its charter (since 1995), and second, in that it will not finance thermal coal mining and coal-fired electricity generation due to their environmental impact.

The following table shows the development of investment volume into the Green Economy Transition (GET) approach, in support of the Paris climate goals.

The EBRD had pledged, prior to 2015 Paris Agreement, to dedicate above 40 per cent of its financing to green investment by 2020. This goal was accomplished for the first time in 2017. With Russia actually being the biggest donor to an NDEP Support Fund for the environments inside the bank, with total contributions amounting to €60 million. €5 million was donated by Russia in the same year of 2015.

== Activities ==

=== Collaboration of the bank with the European institutions and private actors ===
Not only involving the European institutions, the EBRD financed projects also implicate private actors such as firms as well as foreign investors in the process. As part of its lending policies, the EBRD mostly lends capital to the private sector as lending to the public sector is capped at 40% maximum.

=== Influencing ===
As a neoliberal institution, the EBRD participates in policy debates by publishing macroeconomic analysis as well as economic forecasts that are used by both governments and international financial institutions.

=== Mediation ===
More recently, other than its original lending role, the EBRD has played a mediating role in Europe, for instance in Moldova in 2013 and even in the Central Asian region (most notably in countries such as the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan for instance) by intervening as a third party in commercial disputes which has become one of its major areas of activities. As a mediating actor, the EBRD has managed to involve other actors such as businesses and Chambers of Commerce among others. Moreover, a regional forum on commercial mediation was established by the bank as part of its work, which has managed to involve various representatives from countries in Europe and Asia, such as judges and experts for instance.

=== The initial focus on transition economy ===
It is notable that one of the main objectives of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was to become a link between the European Union, its institutions and the countries it would focus on. As the recipients were previously centrally planned economies, the ERBD centered through its operations on working with the private sector, which was the principal target of central planning. Focusing on the integration and modernisation process, as part of its projects, the EBRD has notably invested in important sectors such as telecommunications in the Central and Eastern European countries.

=== To modern challenges ===
Since the 90s, recipients of EBRD financing have diversified, in fact, from mainly targeting EEC countries, the bank has moved to the Asian continent and increasingly focused on other countries such as China. More generally, Suma Chakrabarti, the EBRD president from 2012 to 2020, has pushed in the beginning of the 2010s for modernizing the bank. Reforms encompassed the bank&#x27;s structure in itself, for instance by changing the management team, and its processes (for instance about policy dialogue or methodology regarding the concept of transition) in order for them to be more efficient.

=== Sustainable market economies ===
Since the 2000s, the focus has shifted towards the issue over sustainable market economies, notably in the context of the financial crisis of 2007 which harshly impacted population and their trust in financial institutions, democracy and free market. As a result, a rethinking of the concept of transition has taken place within the EBRD and has impacted the activities of the bank. Furthermore, the concept of transition was reviewed in 2015. In fact, it led to the idea that the ideal market economy is made of a greatly competitive, resilient and integrated market and is complemented by a good governance system conducted by a well-functioning state which has to be environmental friendly and inclusive.

In Armenia, EBRD has been operating since 1986, investing over €2 billion in over 200 projects. More than 90% of these investments have been made in private enterprises. The bank&#x27;s key areas of investment include the financial sector, SMEs, and sustainable infrastructure. They invest, engage in policy-making, and offer technical assistance in order to encourage these areas locally. The EBRD invests around €150 million in Armenia&#x27;s economy every year. Its partner financial institutions lend approximately €100 million to local SMEs through a variety of programs that promote trade, green energy, and financial access.

=== Related to environment and climate change ===
Gradually, climate change and sustainable development became the focus point of the European Union, then consequently found its importance as one of the main challenges that the EBRD has to tackle. It became linked to the objective of forming sustainable market economies. In 2021, Anastassia Obydenkova research has indicated that positive evolutions have been made, for instance that carbon emission from some of the states benefiting from EBRD loans have decreased.

== EBRD key achievements since 2020 ==

Source:

=== Environment ===
The EBRD agreed a new green economy approach for 2021–2025 and adopted a target of becoming a majority green bank by 2025. It invested €3.2 billion in climate mitigation, climate adaptation and other activities related to environmental issues in 2020. Moreover, the EBRD signed up to the Sustainable Blue Economy Finance Principles which represent the world’s first global guiding framework for banks, insurers, and investors to invest in the ocean economy in a sustainable way.

The EBRD also aims to support the corporate transition to decarbonisation, for instance in Poland (EV battery performance), in Turkey (elimination of plastics in single-use hygiene products), and in Ukraine (green supermarkets); and support green infrastructures.

=== Political and human rights standards ===
Linked to its objective of contributing to political transformation in the EBRD&#x27;s country targets in which projects are financed, this institution contributes to political transformation in these same states. From the beginning of the negotiations that led to the creation of the EBRD, the question of democracy and human rights were included in the matter discussed. Those issues are clearly stated in the agreement.

The EBRD is devoted to strengthen its approach to human-rights and also to gender-based issues. For instance, it posted a 14.8 percent year-on-year increase in the number of projects it supports that promote gender inclusion. Moreover, the EBRD established a cross-departmental Human Rights Working Group and has developed internal human rights guidance.

=== COVID-19 response ===
The EBRD provided €802 million of support under the Vital Infrastructure Support Programme launched in April 2020, an emergency support programme for infrastructure providers which is part of its overall Solidarity Package response to COVID-19 adopted on 13 March 2020. The package delivered emergency liquidity and the EBRD invested more than €10 billion, both in 2019 and 2020.

=== Partnerships with NGOs ===
The EBRD has signed partnership agreements with Oxfam and Save the Children.

== Criticism ==

=== About the EBRD ===
In the 90s, the start of the EBRD actions have been considered as slow as the amount of money loaned was rather modest compared to what was available.

There have been criticism regarding potential conflict of interest as it appeared that instead of focusing on public interests, some bankers&#x27; operations were influenced by their clients&#x27; needs, contrary to the objective of the EBRD.

According to an economist named Branko Milanović, the analysis of global distribution of incomes has shown that the positive globalisation impact has mainly favoured the super-rich part of the population, thus deepening the inequalities of wealth concentration within the population. Furthermore, this uneven concentration is notably visible in the countries benefiting from the EBRD activities. This has led to a reflection over the idea of winners and losers regarding globalisation.

In contrast to the highlighted inclusion objective, concerns regarding inclusion, which notably involves gender equality, have been rather absent from the bank&#x27;s attributions until recently. For instance, a Strategic Gender Initiative was validated by the EBRD President in 2013 as well as various projects involving gender equality related objectives.

NGOs have criticised the EBRD on the lack of progress the EBRD makes in its main mission, the “transition towards open and democratic market economies.”

=== Regarding its investments ===
Inequality of the lending : most projects were related to the Visegrad countries that were the ones with the most developed private sectors meaning that the ERBD was underinvesting in the countries that were the most supposed to receive its participation. For instance, those countries (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland) were involved in 46% of the projects signed during the 1991–1993 period.

==== Environmentally harmful projects ====
Some NGOs have criticized the EBRD for financing projects they consider to be environmentally and socially harmful. Although it has increased its investments into energy efficiency and sustainable energy in recent years, these NGOs consider the bank continues to diminish the impacts of green investments by financing carbon-intensive development such as coal, oil and gas production, transportation and generation, motorways, and airports. Among the contested projects are the Ombla power plant in Croatia, the Kumtor Gold Mine in Kyrgyzstan, and the Šoštanj lignite power plant in Slovenia.

==== The Balkans ====
The EBRD&#x27;s activities in the Balkans have attracted particular controversy and criticism, especially when they have centered on national parks or free-flowing rivers. This has often involved the completed or proposed construction of hydroelectric dams and road infrastructure. Indeed, a 2017 report alleged deficiencies in monitoring and mitigation measures that had been designed to lessen the environmental impact of dam projects financed by the EBRD, while, in March 2018, outdoor clothing label Patagonia helped launch &quot;The Dam Truth&quot; campaign, which directly requests international banks including the EBRD to &quot;stop investing in the destruction of Europe&#x27;s last wild rivers&quot;.

In 2011, the EBRD approved a €65 million loan to ELEM, the Macedonian electricity utility, for a dam at Boskov Most. The Standing Committee of the Bern Convention requested immediate suspension of the project, with reference to the high biodiversity of the area and its importance as a core reproductive area for the Balkan lynx, one of the most endangered mammals on the planet. In January 2017, the bank cancelled the loan saying the &quot;conditions for disbursement were not met.&quot;

Again in North Macedonia, the EBRD was criticised by environmentalists after plans were announced to bisect National Park Galičica in the UNESCO Ohrid-Prespa Transboundary Biosphere Reserve with an A3 express road, which would have required certain zones of protection in the national park to be downgraded. Scientists from North Macedonia and across the world signed a declaration in opposition to this and other projects proposed for the Ohrid-Prespa region, a message that was reinforced by a Joint Reactive Monitoring Mission from the World Heritage Centre, ICOMOS and the IUCN, which requested total cancellation of proposed A3 road sections. This recommendation was underlined by the World Heritage Committee at its 41st session in Kraków. Eventually, in February 2018, the Republic of North Macedonia abandoned plans for the road, redirecting the EBRD&#x27;s funds to other infrastructure projects.

=== Regarding the targeted countries ===
Even though, its major objectives is to push for democracy and respect of human rights, the EBRD has been accused of not working towards those goals by not applying enough pressure and even &quot;holding its annual meetings in dictator-run countries&quot;. Furthermore, reports have highlighted the fact that an important part of the loans provided by the EBRD go to countries with authoritarian leaders as of the beginning of 2022, including states such as Belarus or Egypt among others, and this despite its major objective of promoting democracy.

==== 2014 sanctions against Russia ====
The EBRD announced on 23 July 2014 that it would suspend new investment projects in Russia, following an earlier declaration by the European Council. The European Council declaration was made in the context of the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine. As of 2014 Russia has been the biggest funding recipient of all countries. In 2013, the Russian Federation received €1.8 billion for investments from the EBRD and 1 billion € from the EIB. Russia employed the funds to finance a variety of projects like pipeline valves, property acquisitions, and a loan to a hypermarket chain. Two Russian projects were awaiting funding from the EBRD: a €300 million plan for promoting energy efficiency, and a $180 million loan to lease agricultural and forestry equipment. The bank stated that it will continue to manage ongoing projects in Russia. Despite denying Russia new funds, the EBRD continues to insist on its 6.1% of ownership in the Moscow Stock Exchange, seeking profits from Russia with the privatisation of the Soviet economy.

==== Azerbaijan&#x27;s oil and gas sector ====

Building Southern Gas Corridor, European countries and companies support gas export from Azerbaijan and contribute to finance Azerbaijan&#x27;s government. The Aliyev regime is considered by many NGOs and watchdogs organizations as repressive and activists and journalists are regularly arrested on false charges and imprisoned. The International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) wrote in 2015, that &quot;for more than a decade Azerbaijan has made shameless use of caviar diplomacy to charm European governments, its most important oil and gas clients&quot;. The EEC BankWatch warns that &quot;Developing Shah Deniz stage 2 and the Southern Gas Corridor is likely to cement further the oppressive structures of the Aliyev government&quot;.

The EBRD has invested over 3 billion euros ($3.5 billion) in 177 projects in Azerbaijan. The EBRD approved three loans for the Shah Deniz gas field (US$200 million, US$250 million and US$100 million) as well as a US$500 million loan for the Trans-Anatolian gas pipeline (TANAP), and stated its financial support to the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) could amount to EUR 1.2 billion.

<doc id="37964" wikidata="Q60176" url="?curid=37964" title="Yucatán">
<text>Yucatán, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Yucatán, is one of the 31 states which, along with Mexico City, constitute the 32 federal entities of Mexico. It comprises 106 separate municipalities, and its capital city is Mérida.

Located on the northern part of the Yucatán Peninsula, it is bordered by the states of Campeche to the southwest and Quintana Roo to the southeast, with the Gulf of Mexico off its northern coast.

Before the arrival of Spaniards, the peninsula was a very important region for the Maya civilization that reached the peak of its development here, where the Maya founded the cities of Chichen Itza, Izamal, Motul, Mayapan, Ek&#x27; Balam, and Ichkanzihóo (also called T&#x27;ho), now Mérida.

After the Spanish conquest of Yucatán (early 16th to late 17th centuries), the Yucatán Peninsula became a single administrative and political entity, the Captaincy General of Yucatán. Following Mexican independence in 1821 the local Governor proclaimed independence. Yucatán became part of the First Mexican Empire in December 1821. Following the collapse of the Empire in March 1823, the first Republic of Yucatán (founded in May 1823) voluntarily negotiated annexation to the Federal Republic of United Mexican States on December 21, 1823. On March 16, 1841, as a result of cultural and political conflicts around the federal pact, Yucatán declared its independence from Mexico, forming a second Republic of Yucatán. Eventually on July 14, 1848, Yucatán was forced to rejoin Mexico. In 1858, in the middle of the Caste War of Yucatán, the state of Yucatán was divided for the first time, establishing Campeche as a separate state (officially in 1863). During the Porfiriato, in 1902, the state of Yucatán was divided again to form the Federal territory that later became the present state of Quintana Roo.

== Etymology ==

Before the arrival of Spaniards in the Yucatán Peninsula, the name of this region was &quot;Mayab&quot;. In the Yucatec Maya language, &quot;mayab&quot; means &quot;flat&quot;, and is the source of the word &quot;Maya&quot; itself.

The name Yucatán, also assigned to the peninsula, came from early explorations of the Conquistadors from Europe. Three different explanations for the origin of the name have been proposed.

The first two state that the name resulted from confusion between the Maya inhabitants and the first Spanish explorers around 1517:
* According to one of them, Spaniards gave the name of Yucatán to the region because the Maya answered their questions with the phrase &quot;uh yu ka t&#x27;ann&quot;, which in the Maya language means &quot;hear how they talk&quot;.
* It is also said that it came from the answer of an indigenous Maya to the question of a Spanish explorer, who wanted to know the name of the region. The Maya probably replied &quot;Ma&#x27;anaatik ka t&#x27;ann&quot; which means in the Maya language &quot;I do not understand your speech&quot; or &quot;I do not understand you&quot;.

Probably the first person to propose the &quot;I do not understand&quot; version was the friar Toribio de Benavente Motolinía. In his book &quot;Historia de los indios de la Nueva España&quot; (&quot;History of the Indians of New Spain&quot;) he says
because talking with those Indians of the coast, whatever the Spanish asked the Indians responded: &quot;Tectetán, Tectetán&quot; which means &quot;I don&#x27;t understand you, I don&#x27;t understand you&quot;; they corrupted the word, and not understanding what the Indians said, they said: &quot;Yucatán is the name of this land&quot;; and the same happened in a place, a cape, which they also called Cape Cotoch; and &quot;Cotoch&quot; in that language means &quot;house&quot;.

The third proposed explanation comes from Bernal Díaz del Castillo. In his book &quot;Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España&quot; (&quot;True History of the Conquest of New Spain&quot;), he says &quot;Yucatá&quot; means &quot;land of yucas&quot;, a plant that was cultivated by the Maya and was an important food source for them.

== History ==

=== Pre-Columbian era ===

The origin of the first settlements has not been scientifically confirmed, although the presence of first humans in the area dates from the late Pleistocene or ice age (about 10,000–12,000 years), according to the findings in the Loltún caves and caverns of Tulum (Women of the Palms).

The first Maya moved to the Peninsula circa 250 CE, from the Petén (today northern Guatemala), to settle the southeastern peninsula in the modern Bacalar, Quintana Roo. In 525, the Chanés (Maya group that preceded the Itza), moved to the east of the peninsula, founding Chichén Itzá, Izamal, Motul, Ek&#x27; Balam, Ichcaanzihó (modern Mérida) and Champotón. Later, Tutul Xiúes, Toltec descent, who came from the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, settled in the region causing displacement of the Itza and Cocomes—a diversified branch of Itzá—and finally, after years and many battles, the League of Mayapan (composed of the Itza, the Xiús and Cocomes) was formed, which eventually disintegrated circa 1194, giving way to a period of anarchy and fragmentation into small domains which the Spanish conquistadors found in the 16th century.

=== Exploration by Spanish soldiers ===
In 1513, Juan Ponce de León had already conquered the island of Borinquén (now Puerto Rico) and had visited Florida. Antón de Alaminos, who was with Ponce de León on this latest discovery, suspected that west of Cuba they could find new land. Under their influence, Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar, supported by the governor of Cuba, organized an expedition commanded by Francisco Hernández de Córdoba to explore the seas west of the island.

This expedition sailed from port of Ajaruco on February 8, 1517, to La Habana and after circling the island and sailing southwest by what is now known as the Yucatán Channel, the expedition made landfall at the Yucatán Peninsula on March 1. There are discrepancies about where the first explorers arrived. Some say it was in Isla Mujeres. Bernal Díaz del Castillo places it at Cabo Catoche, where they saw a great city which they named the «Gran Cairo».

=== Spanish conquest ===
The conquest of Yucatán was completed two decades after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire by Francisco de Montejo &quot;el Adelantado&quot;, his son Francisco de Montejo y León &quot;el Mozo&quot; and his nephew, Francisco de Montejo &quot;el Sobrino&quot;. &quot;El Adelantado&quot; was in the expedition of Juan de Grijalva and was with Hernán Cortés in the third expedition that eventually became the Conquest of the Aztec Empire. He was subsequently appointed for the conquest of the Maya of Yucatán, but failed in his first attempt in 1527–28. In 1529 he was appointed Governor of Tabasco, with the order to pacify Tabasco and conquer Yucatán and Cozumel.

From Tabasco, Montejo led a new campaign to Yucatán from the west (1531–35) and failed again in his attempt for conquest. Circa 1535, after many bloody battles with the natives, he reached the complete pacification of the Province of Tabasco and began planning his new foray to Yucatán.

&quot;El Adelantado&quot; was appointed governor of Honduras and then of Chiapas. Therefore, he gave his son &quot;El Mozo&quot;, the mission to consummate the conquest of Yucatán. Francisco de Montejo y León &quot;el Mozo&quot; founded the cities of San Francisco de Campeche on October 4, 1540, and Mérida on January 6, 1542 (in honor of Mérida, Extremadura). The city of Mérida was founded over the ruins of the Maya city of Ichkanzihóo (T&#x27;ho) and the stones of old Maya buildings were used for the new buildings. Later, government powers were changed from &quot;Santa María de la Victoria&quot;, Tabasco, to Mérida on June 11, 1542. The newly founded Mérida was besieged by the Maya troops of Nachi Cocom (overlord or &#x27;Halach uinik&#x27; in Yucatec Maya language). It was a definitive battle for the Conquest of Yucatán. With that victory, the Spaniards consolidated their control of the western part of the peninsula.

Francisco de Montejo &quot;El Adelantado&quot; appointed his nephew, Francisco de Montejo &quot;el Sobrino&quot;, to head the conquest of the eastern Yucatán, which was achieved after many bloody battles, ending with the foundation of the city of Valladolid on May 28, 1543.

=== Canek rebellion, during the colonial Yucatán ===

Oppressive policies of inequality and prejudice were imposed on the native Maya by the Spanish colonial government. In November 1761, Jacinto Canek, a Maya from the town of Cisteil (now located in Yaxcabá Municipality), led an armed uprising against the government, which was quickly put down. Captured insurgents were taken to Mérida, where they were tried and tortured. As a warning to the population against rebellion, Cisteil was burned and covered with salt.

This abortive rebellion was not of great consequence to the colonial regime, but it marked the history of the peninsula and clearly delineated anti-colonial tensions in the region. The uprising was a precursor to the social upheaval that would explode less than a century later, as the Caste War. The Canek rebellion is remembered today as a symbol of the racial and social conflict that predominated for centuries in the Spanish colonies.

=== Yucatán in independent Mexico ===
Because of its geographical remoteness from the center of New Spain, especially from Mexico City, Yucatán was not militarily affected by the Mexican War of Independence, though the influence was felt in other ways. In 1820 Lorenzo de Zavala, member of Sanjuanistas (a group of creoles who met at the church of San Juan in downtown Mérida), created the &quot;Patriotic Confederation&quot;, which eventually divided into two groups: the supporters of the Spanish government under the Cádiz Constitution and another led by Zavala, which sought outright independence from Spain. Mariano Carrillo Albornoz then Governor of Yucatán, sent Zavala and Manuel García Sosa as deputies of the Cortes of Cádiz to Madrid, while the other liberals were imprisoned. While this was happening in Yucatán, the Plan of Iguala was proclaimed in the current state of Guerrero (at that time part of the Intendency of Mexico).

On September 15, 1821, in the Hall of Councils of the City of Mérida, Yucatán declared its independence from Spain. Almost immediately, Governor Juan María Echeverri sent two representatives to negotiate the incorporation of Yucatán into the Mexican Empire. The incorporation took place on November 2, 1821.

==== Republic of Yucatán ====

The Mexican Empire was quickly overthrown (1823) under the Plan of Casa Mata, and the provinces of the erstwhile empire became independent states. The first Republic of Yucatán, declared on May 29, 1823, joined the Federal Republic of the United Mexican States as the Federated Republic of Yucatán on December 23, 1823.

The second Republic of Yucatán emerged when the federal pact signed by Yucatán and endorsed in the Constitution of Yucatán of 1825 was broken by the centralist government of Mexico from 1835. In 1841 the state of Tabasco decreed its separation from Mexico and Miguel Barbachano, then governor of Yucatán, sent a commission headed by Justo Sierra O&#x27;Reilly to meet with Tabasco authorities to propose the creation of an independent federal republic from Mexico formed by the two states. The idea failed when Tabasco rejoined Mexico in 1842.

On August 22, 1846, Mexican interim president José Mariano Salas restored the 1824 constitution and federalism. Two years later, during the government of president José Joaquín de Herrera, Miguel Barbachano ordered the reinstatement of Yucatán to Mexico under the Constitution of Yucatán of 1825. A decisive factor for the reinstatement was the Caste War, which forced Yucatán to seek outside help. In 1852 due to internal struggles between opposing political factions, the &quot;Territory of Campeche&quot; was created. On April 29, 1863, during the government of Mexican President Benito Juárez, Campeche gained its current status as an independent state.

==== Flag of the Republic of Yucatán ====
The flag of Yucatán was raised on March 16, 1841. The period of the Republic of Yucatán was the only one in which the banner was officially used by the authorities of Yucatán.

Rodolfo Menéndez de la Peña, historian, describes the flag of Yucatán: &quot;The flag of Yucatán was divided into two parts: green on left, the right, with three divisions, red up and down and white in the middle. In the green field highlighted, five stars, symbolizing the five departments that Yucatan was divided by decree of November 30, 1840: Mérida, Izamal, Valladolid, Tekax and Campeche.&quot;

The flag did not have official recognition in the state however, it maintained a strong recognition among the people of the state.

==== Caste War ====

The Caste War of Yucatán was a conflict that lasted from 1847 to 1901. It began with the revolt of native Maya people led by Maya chiefs Jacinto Pat and Cecilio Chi, against the population of European descent called &quot;Yucatecos&quot;, who had political and economic control. A lengthy war ensued between the Yucateco forces in the north-west of the Yucatán and the independent Maya in the south-east. It officially ended with the occupation of the Maya capital of Chan Santa Cruz by the Mexican army in 1901, although skirmishes with villages and small settlements that refused to acknowledge Mexican control continued for over another decade.

Adam Jones wrote: &quot;This ferocious race war featured genocidal atrocities on both sides, with up to 200,000 killed.&quot;

Because of the conflict, on November 24, 1902, Yucatán had a second territorial division when Porfirio Díaz decreed the creation of the Federal Territory of Quintana Roo, with capital in the port of &quot;Payo Obispo&quot; (today Chetumal). In little more than half a century, Yucatán lost more than two thirds of its original territory.

==== The henequen industry ====
In the late 19th century, the henequen industry grew to unprecedented power in the Yucatan. The henequen grown in the Yucatan was used around the world for rope and twine, and became known as sisal rope, named after the seaside town of Sisal, from where the rope was shipped. Today Sisal is a sleepy fishing village, being rediscovered by locals and visitors as a beach location for vacation homes. The henequen industry provided financial autonomy to the isolated Yucatán. The fiber of the henequén plant (known as &quot;sosquil&quot; (maya: &quot;sos kí&quot;)) was manufactured into twine and rope, used in riggings, string, sacks, rugs, and many other items. It became the chief export item of the Yucatán, making many local families very wealthy. That wealth is today evident in the architecture of the colonial city of Mérida, as well as in the more than 150 haciendas that are spread throughout the Yucatán Peninsula.

Korean immigration to Mexico began in 1905. The first Korean migrants settled in Yucatán as workers in henequen plantations. Labour brokers began advertising in newspapers in the Korean port city of Incheon in 1904 for workers willing to go to Mexico to work on henequen plantations for four- or five-year contracts. A total of more than one thousand were recruited and departed from Incheon on board a British cargo ship on 4 April 1905, despite efforts by the Korean government to block their departure. Once their contracts were up, most settled in Mexico, either continuing to work on henequen plantations or moving to various cities in the country.

Hundreds of prosperous haciendas abounded in the state until the advent of synthetic products after World War II, the cultivation of henequén in other parts of the world and the self-serving actions of some of the leading henequen-growing families led to the gradual decline of the Yucatan&#x27;s monopoly on the industry.

The great influx of wealth during that period from the henequen industry focused mainly on Mérida, the capital of Yucatán State. It allowed the city of Mérida to install street lights and a tram system even before Mexico City. It is said that in the early 20th century, the city had the largest number of millionaires per capita in the world. Today, Paseo de Montejo (inspired by the Parisian avenue Champs-Élysées), is lined with the elegant houses built during that time. These houses are mostly now renovated and serve as everything from private homes to banks, hotels and restaurants. Many of the haciendas today have also been renovated and now serve as private homes, event venues and upscale luxury hotels.

=== Late 20th century ===
Until the mid-20th century most of Yucatán&#x27;s contact with the outside world was by sea; trade with the US and Cuba, as well as Europe and other Caribbean islands, was more significant than that with the rest of Mexico. In the 1950s Yucatán was linked to the rest of Mexico by railway, followed by highway in the 1960s, ending the region&#x27;s comparative isolation. Today Yucatán still demonstrates a unique culture from the rest of Mexico, including its own style of food.

Commercial jet airplanes began arriving in Mérida in the 1960s, and additional international airports were built first in Cozumel and then in the new planned resort community of Cancún in the 1980s, making tourism a major force in the economy of the Yucatán Peninsula.

The first Maya governor of Yucatán, Francisco Luna Kan, was elected in 1976.

Today, the Yucatán Peninsula is a major tourism destination, as well as home to one of the largest indigenous populations in Mexico, the Maya people.

== Geography ==
The State of Yucatán is located on the Yucatán Peninsula. It borders the states of Campeche to the southwest, Quintana Roo to the east and southeast, and the Gulf of Mexico to the north and west. As a whole, the state is extremely flat with little or no topographic variation, with the exception of the Puuc hills, located in the southern portion of the state.

== Demography ==

===Largest cities===

=== Languages ===

The most widespread indigenous language of Yucatán is Yucatec Maya, spoken natively by approximately 800,000 people in Yucatán and adjacent Quintana Roo and Campeche, especially in rural areas. The Spanish spoken in Yucatán has lexical and some phonological borrowing from Mayan and employs many words of Mayan origin, such as &#x27; (&quot;fat&quot;), &#x27; (&quot;navel&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (&quot;urinate&quot;).

=== Korean immigration ===
In 1905, 1,003 Korean immigrants – 802 men and 231 women and children – departed from the port of Chemulpo, Incheon, aboard the ship &quot;Ilford&quot; to Salina Cruz, Oaxaca. The journey took 45 days, after which they took a train to Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz. At Coatzacoalcos, another boat was taken to the port of Progreso, with the final destination being the city of Mérida. They arrived in May 1905, with previously signed contracts for four years&#x27; work as indentured laborers on the Yucatán henequen haciendas. Many of these Koreans were distributed throughout Yucatán in 32 henequen haciendas. The town of Motul, Yucatán, located in the heart of the henequen zone, was a destination for many of the Korean immigrants. Subsequently, in 1909, at the end of their contracts, they began a new stage in which they scattered even further. Thus, the majority of those who came were single men who made or remade their family lives with Yucatecan especially Maya women. While Korean girls were much more subject to marriages arranged by Korean parents, males had greater freedom when it came to making a family. This rapid intermarriage by Koreans, coupled with geographic dispersal, prevented the establishment of close social networks among these migrants and therefore provided the basis for Korean descendants across the Yucatán Peninsula. After that 1905 ship, no further entries of Koreans into Mexico were recorded until many years later, leading to a new community of Koreans with completely different characteristics from those who entered in 1905.

== Government and politics ==

=== Government ===
The Constitution of Yucatán provides that the government of Yucatán, like the government of every other state in Mexico, consists of three powers: the executive, the legislative and the judiciary.

Executive power rests in the governor of Yucatán, who is directly elected by the citizens, using a secret ballot, to a six-year term with no possibility of reelection. Legislative power rests in the Congress of Yucatán which is a unicameral legislature composed of 25 deputies. Judicial power is invested in the High Court of Justice of Yucatán and its district courts.

=== Municipalities ===
The State of Yucatán is divided into 106 municipalities, each headed by a municipal president (mayor). Usually municipalities are named after the city that serves as municipal seat; e.g. the municipal seat of the municipality of Mérida is the city of Mérida.

=== Politics ===
The 2024 local election in Yucatán was held on 2 June. Joaquín Díaz Mena was elected to succeed Mauricio Vila Dosal as governor.


==Media==
Newspapers of Yucatán include: &quot;Artículo 7&quot;, &quot;De Peso (Mérida)&quot;, &quot;Diario de Yucatán&quot;, &quot;La I Noticias para Mí Mérida&quot;, &quot;Milenio Novedades (Antes El Mundo al Día)&quot;, and &quot;Por Esto! (Yucatán).&quot;

== Food ==
Yucatecan food is its own unique style and is very different from what most people would consider Mexican food. It includes influences from the local Maya culture, as well as Caribbean, European (Spanish), (North) African, and Middle Eastern cultures, as well as influence from the cuisine of other parts of Mexico.

There are many regional dishes. Some of them are:
*&quot;Poc Chuc&quot;, a Maya/Yucatecan version of barbecued pork.
*&quot;Salbutes and Panuchos&quot;. &quot;Salbutes&quot; are soft, cooked tortillas with lettuce, tomato, turkey, and avocado on top. &quot;Panuchos&quot; feature fried tortillas filled with black beans and topped with turkey or chicken, lettuce, avocado and pickled onions. Habanero chiles accompany most dishes, either in solid or puréed form, along with fresh limes and corn tortillas.
*&quot;Queso relleno&quot;, a &quot;gourmet&quot; dish featuring ground pork inside of a carved Edam cheese ball served with tomato sauce and gravy.
*&quot;Pavo en Relleno Negro&quot;, a turkey meat stew cooked with a black paste made from roasted chiles, a local version of the &quot;mole de guajalote&quot; found throughout Mexico. The meat soaked in the black soup is also served in tacos, sandwiches and even in &quot;panuchos&quot; or &quot;salbutes&quot; and is usually referred to as &quot;Relleno negro&quot;.
*&quot;Sopa de Lima&quot;, a lime-flavored soup with meat (turkey, chicken, or pork), served with tortilla chips.
*&quot;Papadzules&quot;, egg tacos covered in pumpkin seed sauce and tomatoes.
*&quot;Cochinita Pibil&quot;, a marinated pork dish and by far the most renowned of Yucatecan food.
*&quot;Xcatik&quot;, a type of chili.
*&quot;Pavo en Relleno Blanco&quot; (or simply &quot;Relleno Blanco&quot;), a turkey stew almost like &quot;Pavo en Relleno Negro&quot;.
*Xnipec, a fiery hot salsa or relish similar to pico de gallo, made with habanero chiles and Seville orange juice

== Safety ==
 the Mexican National Public Security System ranked Yucatán among the safest Mexican states.
It is one of the two states the U.S. advises its citizens to exercise normal precautions, alongside neighbouring Campeche. Yucatán is the safest state in Mexico and Mérida was awarded &quot;City of Peace&quot; in 2011.

The Yucatán State Police is the law enforcement agency inside the state. The security in the interior of the state was praised multiple times by former president Felipe Calderón Hinojosa, local and foreign businessmen, as well as by governor Ivonne Ortega Pacheco.

<text>The Himalayas, or Himalaya ( ) is a mountain range in Asia, separating the plains of the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau. The range has some of the Earth&#x27;s highest peaks, including the highest, Mount Everest. More than 100 peaks exceeding elevations of above sea level lie in the Himalayas.

The Himalayas abut on or cross territories of six countries: Nepal, China, Pakistan, Bhutan, India and Afghanistan. The sovereignty of the range in the Kashmir region is disputed among India, Pakistan, and China. The Himalayan range is bordered on the northwest by the Karakoram and Hindu Kush ranges, on the north by the Tibetan Plateau, and on the south by the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Some of the world&#x27;s major rivers, the Indus, the Ganges, and the Tsangpo–Brahmaputra, rise in the vicinity of the Himalayas, and their combined drainage basin is home to some 600 million people; 53 million people live in the Himalayas. The Himalayas have profoundly shaped the cultures of South Asia and Tibet. Many Himalayan peaks are sacred in Hinduism and Buddhism. The summits of several—Kangchenjunga (from the Indian side), Gangkhar Puensum, Machapuchare, Nanda Devi, and Kailash in the Tibetan Transhimalaya—are off-limits to climbers.

The Himalayas were uplifted after the collision of the Indian tectonic plate with the Eurasian plate, specifically, by the folding, or nappe-formation of the uppermost Indian crust, even as a lower layer continued to push on into Tibet and add thickness to its plateau; the still lower crust, along with the mantle, however, subducted under Eurasia. The Himalayan mountain range runs west-northwest to east-southeast in an arc long. Its western anchor, Nanga Parbat, lies just south of the northernmost bend of the Indus river. Its eastern anchor, Namcha Barwa, lies immediately west of the great bend of the Yarlung Tsangpo River. The Indus-Yarlung suture zone, along which the headwaters of these two rivers flow, separates the Himalayas from the Tibetan plateau; the rivers also separate the Himalayas from the Karakorams, the Hindu Kush, and the Transhimalaya. The range varies in width from in the west to in the east.

==Etymology==
The name of the range hails from the Sanskrit ( &#x27;abode of snow&#x27;), from ( &#x27;frost/cold&#x27;) and ( &#x27;dwelling/house&#x27;). They are now known as &quot;&quot;, usually shortened to &quot;the Himalayas&quot;.

The mountains are known as the in Nepali and Hindi (both written ), &quot;Hinvāl&quot; (हिंवाळ) in Garhwali, &quot;Himāl&quot; (हिमाल) in Kumaoni, the &quot;Himalaya&quot; () or &#x27;The Land of Snow&#x27; () in Tibetan, also known as in Sinhala (written as ), the &quot;Himāliya&quot; Mountain Range () in Urdu, the &quot;Himaloy Parvatmala&quot; () in Bengali, and the &quot;Ximalaya&quot; Mountain Range () in Chinese.

The name of the range is sometimes also given as Himavan in older writings, including the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata. Himavat (Sanskrit: हिमवत्&quot;)&quot; or Himavan Himavān (Sanskrit: हिमवान्) is a Hindu deity who is the personification of the Himalayan Mountain Range. Other epithets include Himaraja (Sanskrit: हिमराज, ) or Parvateshwara (Sanskrit: पर्वतेश्वर, ).

In western literature, some writers refer to it as &quot;the Himalaya&quot;. This was also previously transcribed as &quot;Himmaleh&quot;, as in Emily Dickinson&#x27;s poetry and Henry David Thoreau&#x27;s essays.

==Geography and key features==

The Himalayas consists of four parallel mountain ranges from south to north: the Sivalik Hills on the south; the Lower Himalayan Range; the Great Himalayas, which is the highest and central range; and the Tibetan Himalayas on the north. The Karakoram are generally considered separate from the Himalayas.

In the middle of the great curve of the Himalayan mountains lie the peaks of Dhaulagiri and Annapurna in Nepal, separated by the Kali Gandaki Gorge. The gorge splits the Himalayas into Western and Eastern sections, both ecologically and orographically – the pass at the head of the Kali Gandaki, the Kora La, is the lowest point on the ridgeline between Everest and K2 (the highest peak of the Karakoram range). To the east of Annapurna are the peaks of Manaslu and across the border in Tibet, Shishapangma. To the south of these lies Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal and the largest city in the Himalayas. East of the Kathmandu Valley lies the valley of the Bhote/Sun Kosi river which rises in Tibet and provides the main overland route between Nepal and China – the Araniko Highway/China National Highway 318. Further east is the Mahalangur Himal with four of the world&#x27;s six highest mountains, including the highest: Cho Oyu, Everest, Lhotse, and Makalu. The Khumbu region, popular for trekking, is found here on the south-western approaches to Everest. The Arun river drains the northern slopes of these mountains, before turning south and flowing to the range to the east of Makalu.

In the far east of Nepal, the Himalayas rise to the Kangchenjunga massif on the border with India, the third-highest mountain in the world, the most easterly summit and the highest point of India. The eastern side of Kangchenjunga is in the Indian state of Sikkim. Formerly an independent Kingdom, it lies on the main route from India to Lhasa, Tibet, which passes over the Nathu La pass into Tibet. East of Sikkim lies the ancient Buddhist Kingdom of Bhutan. The highest mountain in Bhutan is Gangkhar Puensum, which is also a strong candidate for the highest unclimbed mountain in the world. The Himalayas here are becoming increasingly rugged, with heavily forested steep valleys. The Himalayas continue, turning slightly northeast, through the Indian State of Arunachal Pradesh as well as Tibet, before reaching their easterly conclusion in the peak of Namche Barwa, situated in Tibet, inside the great bend of the Yarlang Tsangpo river. On the other side of the Tsangpo, to the east, are the Kangri Garpo mountains. The high mountains to the north of the Tsangpo, including Gyala Peri, however, are also sometimes included in the Himalayas.

Going west from Dhaulagiri, Western Nepal is somewhat remote and lacks major high mountains, but is home to Rara Lake, the largest lake in Nepal. The Karnali River rises in Tibet but cuts through the centre of the region. Further west, the border with India follows the Sarda River and provides a trade route into China, where on the Tibetan plateau lies the high peak of Gurla Mandhata. Just across Lake Manasarovar from this lies the sacred Mount Kailash in the Kailash Ranges, which stands close to the source of the four main rivers of Himalayas and is revered in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Sufism and Bonpo. In Uttarakhand, the Himalayas are regionally divided into the Kumaon and Garhwal Himalayas with the high peaks of Nanda Devi and Kamet. The state is also home to the important pilgrimage destinations of Chota Chaar Dhaam, with Gangotri, the source of the holy river Ganges, Yamunotri, the source of the river Yamuna, and the temples at Badrinath and Kedarnath.

The next Himalayan Indian state, Himachal Pradesh, is noted for its hill stations, particularly Shimla, the summer capital of the British Raj, and Dharamsala, the centre of the Tibetan community and government in exile in India. This area marks the start of the Punjab Himalaya and the Sutlej river, the most easterly of the five tributaries of the Indus, cuts through the range here. Further west, the Himalayas form much of the disputed Indian-administered union territory of Jammu and Kashmir where lie the mountainous Jammu region and the renowned Kashmir Valley with the town and lakes of Srinagar. The Himalayas form most of the south-west portion of the disputed Indian-administered union territory of Ladakh. The twin peaks of Nun Kun are the only mountains over in this part of the Himalayas. Finally, the Himalayas reach their western end in the dramatic 8000 m peak of Nanga Parbat, which rises over above the Indus valley and is the most westerly of the 8000 m summits. The western end terminates at a magnificent point near Nanga Parbat where the Himalayas intersect with the Karakoram and Hindu Kush ranges, in the disputed Pakistani-administered territory of Gilgit-Baltistan. Some portion of the Himalayas, such as the Kaghan Valley, Margalla Hills, and Galyat tract, extend into the Pakistani provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab.

==Geology==




Tectonics, the recurring physical changes that affect the arrangement of the Earth&#x27;s crust, and plate tectonics, the movement of large regions of the Earth&#x27;s crust in the manner of planar rigid bodies, are key to understanding the formation of the Himalayas. The Earth&#x27;s crust rests directly on its mantle. Tectonic plates, comprising the crust and the upper portions of their underlying mantle, are moved around by convection in the asthenosphere. The oceanic crust, found beneath oceans, is, on average, 7 km thick. It is created from upwelling magma at mid-ocean ridges and predominantly consists of basalt, the principal igneous rock on Earth. In contrast, the continental crust underlying dry land has an average thickness of 35 km and is rich in silica, which is less dense than basalt. It makes the continental tectonic plates more buoyant than the oceanic. 

India&#x27;s defining geologic processes, which began 70 million years ago, had involved India rifting, or splitting away, from Gondwana, and the Indian continental plate along with the Neo-Tethys oceanic plate above it jointly moving northward. As these eventually reached the Eurasian plate, the less buoyant oceanic plate subducted, or slid under Eurasia and was carried into the deeper asthenosphere. In contrast, the Indian continental plate was obstructed because of its thickness and buoyancy. The lateral compression generated by the obstruction caused the plate to be sheared horizontally. Its lower crust and mantle slid under, but one layer of the upper crust piled up in sheets (called nappes) ahead of the subduction zone. Geophysicist Peter Molnar noted that most of the Himalayas are &quot;slices of rock that once were the top part of India&#x27;s crust.&quot; This is the process of mountain building, or orogeny, in the Himalayas. 

Before the orogeny, the Eurasian coastline had been similar to today&#x27;s Central Andes. Along such coastlines, the adjoining oceanic plate subducts and erupts as volcanoes. Magma, which eventually crystallizes into granite, rises into the Earth&#x27;s crust below the active volcanoes but not to the surface. When India&#x27;s continental plate pushed against Eurasia, not only did a part of the upper crust fold in nappes, but another stiffer part began to push against (or drag) Eurasia&#x27;s ancient volcanic mountains farther north. As a result, the crust of this formerly coastal region shortened under compression and thickened to become what is today the Tibetan Plateau. Isostatic equilibrium, or the balance between the gravitational force pulling down on the crust and the force of buoyancy pushing up from the mantle, gives the Tibetan Plateau its notable thickness and altitude.

The Indian plate was not the only landmass that had rifted from Gondwana and drifted northward toward Eurasia. Before the India-Eurasia collision in Middle Paleocene (60 Mya) and subsequent Himalayan orogeny, two other landmasses, the Qiangtang terrane and Lhasa terrane, had drifted up from Gondwana. Qiangtang, a geological region in what is today northern Tibet, had done so in Late Triassic (237–201 Mya). The Lhasa terrane collided with the southern boundary of the Qiangtang in the Early Cretaceous (145–100 Mya). The collision caused the lithospheric mantle of the Lhasa terrane to thicken and shorten, forming a barrier that later prevented the Indian lithosphere from fully subducting under Tibet and leading to further thickening of the Tibetan plateau. The suture zones, or remains of the subduction zone and the terranes that are joined, are found in the Tibetan plateau. The Qiantang and Lhasa terranes were part of the string of microcontinents Cimmeria, today constituting parts of Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, China, Myanmar, Thailand and Malaysia, which had rifted from Gondwana earlier, closing the Paleo-Tethys Ocean above them and opening the Neo-Tethys Ocean between them and Gondwana, eventually colliding with Eurasia, and creating the Cimmerian Orogeny. 

After the Lhasa terrane had adjoined Eurasia, an active continental margin opened along its southern flank, below which the Neo-Tethys oceanic plate had begun to subduct. Magmatic activity along this flank produced the Gangdese batholith in what is today the Tibetan trans-Himalaya. Another subduction zone opened to the west, in the ocean basin above the Kohistan-Ladakh island arc. This island arc—formed by one oceanic plate subducting beneath another, its magma rising and creating continental crust—drifted north, closed its ocean basin and collided with Eurasia.

The collision of India with Eurasia closed the Neo-Tethys Ocean. The suture zone (in this instance, the remnants of the Neo-Tethys subduction zone pinched between the two continental crusts), which marks India&#x27;s welding to Eurasia, is called the Indus-Yarlung suture zone. It lies north of the Himalayas. The headwaters of the Indus River and the Yarlung Tsangpo (later in its course, the Brahmaputra) flow along this suture zone. These two Eurasian rivers, whose courses were continually diverted by the rising Himalayas, define the western and eastern limits, respectively, of the Himalayan mountain range.

During the India-Eurasia collision, two elongated protrusions located on either side of the northern border of the Indian continent generated areas of extreme deformation. A point where mountain ranges with different directions of extension, and thus formed by tectonic forces at varying angles, converge is called a syntaxis (&quot;Greek&quot;: convergence). The two syntaxes, Nanga Parbat and Namche Barwa, on the northwestern and northeastern corners of the Indian continent, respectively, are characterized by the quick upward movement of land or rocks that were once deeply buried and significantly altered by extreme heat and pressure. Geologists have estimated the rate of uplift of these rocks to be per year, or per million years. The protruding regions have some of the highest mountain peaks at and , respectively. The regions also have the greatest topographical relief in the interior of a continent, approximately over a horizontal distance of . Nanga Parbat has a narrow, anticline, or arch-shaped fold whose crest dips sharply to the north, perpendicular to the general direction along which the Himalayas extend. The Indus and Yarlung Tsangpo, which originally emptied into the New-Tethys, now bend around the Nanga Parbat and Namche Barwa, respectively, to eventually empty into the Indian Ocean.

Geologists Wolfgang Frisch, Martin Meschede, and Ronand Blakey write, &quot;India rapidly marched northward towards Asia with a velocity of ca. 20 cm/yr, a plate velocity that exceeds any modern example. This velocity considerably slowed to ca. 5 cm/yr following the collision, yet India continued to protrude into Asia for more than 2000 km. ... The irregular northern margin of the Indian continental crust first came into contact with Eurasia along its northwestern corner, approximately 55 Ma. As a consequence, India underwent a counter-clockwise rotation to close the remaining part of the Neotethys in scissor-like fashion from west to east. The closure of the Neotethys was completed approximately 40 Ma.&quot;

Today, the Indian plate continues to be driven horizontally at the Tibetan Plateau, which forces the plateau to continue to move upwards. The Indian plate is moving at per year, and over the next 10 million years, it will travel into Asia. Approximately 20 mm per year of the India-Asia convergence is absorbed by thrusting along the Himalaya southern front. This leads to the Himalayas rising by about 5 mm annually, making them geologically active. The movement of the Indian plate into the Asian plate also makes this region seismically active, leading to earthquakes from time to time.

The Himalayan mountain range consists of three sub-ranges: (1) the Higher- or &quot;Tethys&quot; Himalayas, (2) the Lesser Himalayas, and (3) the Siwaliks. The nappes—large, stacked sheets of rock—found in the Tethys Himalayan mountain range, are primarily composed of sedimentary rocks, such as limestone formed from the accumulation and compression of sediments like sand, mud, and shells deposited in the Neo-Tethys seabed during the Paleogene&quot; (66 Mya–23 Mya). Below the sedimentary rocks in the Higher and Lesser Himalayas is a bottom layer, or basement, composed of metamorphic rock formed much earlier during the Pan-African-Cadomian orogeny between 650 Mya and 550 Mya. The lowest subrange, the Siwaliks, represents the sedimentary rock deposits washed off the rising Himalayas in a foreland basin, a low-lying crustal region, at their foot. It primarily consists of sandstones, shales, and conglomerates formed during the Neogene period (23 Mya to 2.6 Mya). 

Geologists Wolfgang Frisch, Martin Meschede, and Ronand Blakey further write, &quot;The Siwaliks are both underlain and overlain by thrusts; they have been overridden by the nappe stack of the Higher and Lesser Himalayas and, in turn, are thrust over more interior parts of the Indian continent. Each of the three mega-units is internally imbricated into several individual nappes. Fensters (windows) and klippen provide important structural information regarding the thrust belts and help document the existence of broad thrust sheets, some of which record thrust distances in excess of 100 km. A fenster or window is an erosional hole through a thrust sheet that exposes a tectonically lower unit framed by a higher unit; a klippe is detached by erosion and forms a remnant of a nappe or higher thrust sheet
that rests on top of a lower unit.&quot;

==Hydrology==
Despite their scale, the Himalayas do not form a major continental divide, and a number of rivers cut through the range, particularly in the eastern part of the range. As a result, the main ridge of the Himalayas is not clearly defined, and mountain passes are not as significant for traversing the range as with other mountain ranges. Himalayas&#x27; rivers drain into two large systems:
* The western rivers combine into the &quot;Indus Basin&quot;. The Indus itself forms the northern and western boundaries of the Himalayas. It begins in Tibet, at the confluence of Sengge and Gar rivers, and flows north-west through India into Pakistan before turning south-west to the Arabian Sea. It is fed by several major tributaries draining the southern slopes of the Himalayas, including the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej rivers, the five rivers of the Punjab.
* The other Himalayan rivers drain the &quot;Ganges-Brahmaputra Basin&quot;. Its main rivers are the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, and the Yamuna, as well as other tributaries. The Brahmaputra originates as the Yarlung Tsangpo River in western Tibet, and flows east through Tibet and west through the plains of Assam. The Ganges and the Brahmaputra meet in Bangladesh and drain into the Bay of Bengal through the world&#x27;s largest river delta, the Sunderbans.

The northern slopes of Gyala Peri and the peaks beyond the Tsangpo, sometimes included in the Himalayas, drain into the Irrawaddy River, which originates in eastern Tibet and flows south through Myanmar to drain into the Andaman Sea. The Salween, Mekong, Yangtze, and Yellow River all originate from parts of the Tibetan Plateau that are geologically distinct from the Himalaya mountains and are therefore not considered true Himalayan rivers. Some geologists refer to all the rivers collectively as the &quot;circum-Himalayan rivers&quot;.

===Glaciers===

The great ranges of central Asia, including the Himalayas, contain the third-largest deposit of ice and snow in the world, after Antarctica and the Arctic. Some even refer to this region as the &quot;Third Pole&quot;. The Himalayan range encompasses about 15,000 glaciers, which store about , or 3600–4400 Gt (10 kg) of fresh water. Its glaciers include the Gangotri and Yamunotri (Uttarakhand) and Khumbu glaciers (Mount Everest region), Langtang glacier (Langtang region), and Zemu (Sikkim).

Owing to the mountains&#x27; latitude near the Tropic of Cancer, the permanent snow line is among the highest in the world, at typically around . In contrast, equatorial mountains in New Guinea, the Rwenzoris, and Colombia have a snow line some lower. The higher regions of the Himalayas are snowbound throughout the year, in spite of their proximity to the tropics, and they form the sources of several large perennial rivers.

In recent years, scientists have monitored a notable increase in the rate of glacier retreat across the region as a result of climate change. For example, glacial lakes have been forming rapidly on the surface of debris-covered glaciers in the Bhutan Himalaya during the last few decades. Studies have measured an approximately 13% overall decrease in glacial coverage in the Himalayas over the last 40–50 years. Local conditions play a large role in glacial retreat, however, and glacial loss can vary locally from a few m/yr to 61 m/yr. A marked acceleration in glacial mass loss has also been observed since 1975, from about 5–13 Gt/yr to 16–24 Gt/yr. Although the effect of this will not be known for many years, it potentially could mean disaster for the hundreds of millions of people who rely on the glaciers to feed the rivers during the dry seasons. The global climate change will affect the water resources and livelihoods of the Greater Himalayan region.

During the last ice age, there was a connected ice stream of glaciers between Kangchenjunga in the east and Nanga Parbat in the west. In the west, the glaciers joined with the ice stream network in the Karakoram, and in the north, they joined with the former Tibetan inland ice. To the south, outflow glaciers came to an end below an elevation of . While the current valley glaciers of the Himalaya reach at most in length, several of the main valley glaciers were long during the ice age. The glacier snowline (the altitude where accumulation and ablation of a glacier are balanced) was about lower than it is today. Thus, the climate was at least colder than it is today.

===Lakes===

The Himalayan region is dotted with hundreds of lakes. Pangong Tso, which is spread across the border between India and China, at the far western end of Tibet, is among the largest with a surface area of .

South of the main range, the lakes are smaller. Tilicho Lake in Nepal, in the Annapurna massif, is one of the highest lakes in the world. Other lakes include Rara Lake in western Nepal, She-Phoksundo Lake in the Shey Phoksundo National Park of Nepal, Gurudongmar Lake, in North Sikkim, Gokyo Lakes in Solukhumbu district of Nepal, and Lake Tsongmo, near the Indo-China border in Sikkim.

Some of the lakes present the danger of a glacial lake outburst flood. The Tsho Rolpa glacier lake in the Rowaling Valley, in the Dolakha District of Nepal, is rated as the most dangerous. The lake, which is located at an altitude of , has grown considerably over the last 50 years due to glacial melting. The mountain lakes are known to geographers as &quot;tarns&quot; if they are caused by glacial activity. Tarns are found mostly in the upper reaches of the Himalaya, above .

Temperate Himalayan wetlands provide important habitat and layover sites for migratory birds. Many mid and low altitude lakes remain poorly studied in terms of their hydrology and biodiversity, like Khecheopalri in the Sikkim Eastern Himalayas.

==Climate==
===Temperature===
The physical factors determining the climate in any location in the Himalayas include latitude, altitude, and the relative motion of the Southwest monsoon. From north to south, the mountains cover more than eight degrees of latitude, spanning temperate to subtropical zones. The colder air of Central Asia is prevented from blowing down into South Asia by the physical configuration of the Himalayas. This causes the tropical zone to extend farther north in South Asia than anywhere else in the world. The evidence is unmistakable in the Brahmaputra valley as the warm air from the Bay of Bengal bottlenecks and rushes up past Namcha Barwa, the eastern anchor of the Himalayas, and into southeastern Tibet. Temperatures in the Himalayas cool by 2.0 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) for every increase of altitude.

As the physical features of mountains are irregular, with broken jagged contours, there can be wide variations in temperature over short distances. Temperature at a location on a mountain depends on the season of the year, the bearing of the sun with respect to the face on which the location lies, and the mass of the mountain, i.e. the amount of matter in the mountain. As the temperature is directly proportional to received radiation from the sun, the faces that receive more direct sunlight also have a greater heat buildup. In narrow valleys—lying between steep mountain faces—there can be dramatically different weather along their two margins. The side to the north with a mountain above facing south can have an extra month of the growing season. The mass of the mountain also influences the temperature, as it acts as a heat island, in which more heat is absorbed and retained than the surroundings, and therefore influences the heat budget or the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature from the winter minimum to the summer maximum.

The immense scale of the Himalayas means that many summits can create their own weather, the temperature fluctuating from one summit to another, from one face to another, and all may be quite different from the weather in nearby plateaus or valleys.

===Precipitation===
The Himalayan hydroclimate is crucial for South Asia, where annual summer monsoon floods impact millions.

A critical influence on the Himalayan climate is the Southwest Monsoon. Variability in monsoon rainfall, influenced by local Hadley circulation and tropical sea surface temperatures, is the main factor behind wet and dry years. This is not so much the rain of the summer months as the wind that carries the rain. Different rates of heating and cooling between the Central Asian continent and the Indian Ocean create large differences in the atmospheric pressure prevailing above each. In the winter, a high-pressure system forms and remains suspended above Central Asia, forcing air to flow in the southerly direction over the Himalayas. But in Central Asia, as there is no substantial source for water to be diffused as vapour, the winter winds blowing across South Asia are dry. In the summer months, the Central Asian plateau heats up more than the ocean waters to its south. As a result, the air above it rises higher and higher, creating a thermal low. Off-shore high-pressure systems in the Indian Ocean push the moist summer air inland toward the low-pressure system. When the moist air meets mountains, it rises and upon subsequent cooling, its moisture condenses and is released as rain, typically heavy rain. The wet summer monsoon winds cause precipitation in India and all along the layered southern slopes of the Himalayas. This forced lifting of air is called the orographic effect.
===Winds===
The vast size, huge altitude range, and complex topography of the Himalayas mean they experience a wide range of climates, from humid subtropical in the foothills, to cold and dry desert conditions on the Tibetan side of the range. For much of the Himalayas—in the areas to the south of the high mountains, the monsoon is the most characteristic feature of the climate and causes most of the precipitation, while the western disturbance brings winter precipitation, especially in the west. Heavy rain arrives on the southwest monsoon in June and persists until September. The monsoon can seriously impact transport and cause major landslides. It restricts tourism – the trekking and mountaineering season is limited to either before the monsoon in April/May or after the monsoon in October/November (autumn). In Nepal and Sikkim, there are often considered to be five seasons: summer, monsoon, autumn, (or post-monsoon), winter, and spring.

Using the Köppen climate classification, the lower elevations of the Himalayas, reaching in mid-elevations in central Nepal (including the Kathmandu valley), are classified as &quot;Cwa&quot;, Humid subtropical climate with dry winters. Higher up, most of the Himalayas have a subtropical highland climate (&quot;Cwb&quot;).

The intensity of the southwest monsoon diminishes as it moves westward along the range, with as much as of rainfall in the monsoon season in Darjeeling in the east, compared to only during the same period in Shimla in the west.

The northern side of the Himalayas, also known as the Tibetan Himalaya, is dry, cold, and generally windswept, particularly in the west where it has a cold desert climate. The vegetation is sparse and stunted and the winters are severely cold. Most of the precipitation in the region is in the form of snow during the late winter and spring months.

Local impacts on climate are significant throughout the Himalayas. Temperatures fall by 0.2 to 1.2 °C for every rise in altitude. This gives rise to a variety of climates, from a nearly tropical climate in the foothills, to tundra and permanent snow and ice at higher elevations. Local climate is also affected by the topography: The leeward side of the mountains receive less rain while the well-exposed slopes get heavy rainfall and the rain shadow of large mountains can be significant, for example, leading to near desert conditions in the Upper Mustang, which is sheltered from the monsoon rains by the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri massifs and has annual precipitation of around , while Pokhara on the southern side of the massifs has substantial rainfall ( a year). Thus, although annual precipitation is generally higher in the east than in the west, local variations are often more important.

The Himalayas have a profound effect on the climate of the Indian subcontinent and the Tibetan Plateau. They prevent frigid, dry winds from blowing south into the subcontinent, which keeps South Asia much warmer than corresponding temperate regions in the other continents. It also forms a barrier for the monsoon winds, keeping them from traveling northwards, and causing heavy rainfall in the Terai region. The Himalayas are also believed to play an important part in the formation of Central Asian deserts, such as the Taklamakan and Gobi.

==Ecology==

The flora and fauna of the Himalayas vary with climate, rainfall, altitude, and soils. The climate ranges from tropical at the base of the mountains to permanent ice and snow at the highest elevations. The amount of yearly rainfall increases from west to east along the southern front of the range. This diversity of altitude, rainfall, and soil conditions, combined with the very high snow line, supports a variety of distinct plant and animal communities. The extremes of high altitude (low atmospheric pressure), combined with extreme cold, favor extremophile organisms.

At high altitudes, the elusive and previously endangered snow leopard is the main predator. Its prey includes members of the goat family grazing on the alpine pastures and living on the rocky terrain, notably the endemic bharal or Himalayan blue sheep. The Himalayan musk deer is also found at high altitudes. Hunted for its musk, it is now rare and endangered. Other endemic or near-endemic herbivores include the Himalayan tahr, the takin, the Himalayan serow, and the Himalayan goral. The critically endangered Himalayan subspecies of the brown bear is found sporadically across the range, as is the Asian black bear. In the mountainous mixed deciduous and conifer forests of the eastern Himalayas, red pandas feed in the dense understories of bamboo. Lower down, the forests of the foothills are inhabited by several different primates, including the endangered Gee&#x27;s golden langur and the Kashmir gray langur, with highly restricted ranges in the east and west of the Himalayas, respectively.

The unique floral and faunal wealth of the Himalayas is undergoing structural and compositional changes due to climate change. &quot;Hydrangea hirta&quot; is an example of floral species that can be found in this area. The increase in temperature is shifting various species to higher elevations. The oak forest is being invaded by pine forests in the Garhwal Himalayan region. There are reports of early flowering and fruiting in some tree species, especially rhododendron, apple, and &quot;box myrtle&quot;. The highest known tree species in the Himalayas is &quot;Juniperus tibetica,&quot; located at in Southeastern Tibet.
==Climate-related concerns==

Similar to the mountains, the communities living near the Himalayas are experiencing climate change and its negative impacts significantly more than other parts of the world. Some of the impacts that the communities are facing include erratic rainfall, flooding, rising temperatures, and landslides. These impacts can have extreme negative effects on the villages living in the area especially as the temperatures rise at higher rates than many other places in the world (Alexander et al., 2014). There are more than 1.9 million people who are highly vulnerable due to climate change with an additional 10 million people at risk in Nepal. Nepal is among the top ten most vulnerable Global South countries due to climate change in the world, standing at number 4 as of 2010 according to the climate change risk atlas. According to NAPA (National Adaptation Program of Action) of Nepal, many threats including floods, droughts, and landslides are an imminent threat to the glacial lake area. With this in consideration, climate change policy and framework for LAPA (Local Adaptation Plans of Action) were prepared in 2011 primarily focusing on addressing climatic hazards.

===Health impacts===

Local communities are suffering from food scarcity and malnutrition as well as an increasing risk to diseases such as malaria and dengue fever as temperatures rise and allow these diseases to migrate further north. There is also an increasing risk of water borne illnesses accompanied by an increasing lack of safe drinking water. Illness is not the only danger to the communities as temperatures sky rocket. With the climate changing weather patterns are also changing and more extreme weather events are occurring putting local communities more at risk to physical harm and death during erratic weather events. Marginalized groups including children and women are experiencing more severe impacts from climate change and are often more exposed to disease and injury. Over the last couple years these health impacts have gotten increasingly worse and more common. Recent studies have shown that dengue fever has had a consistent pattern of epidemic in Nepal in the years 2010, 2013, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2022 with the largest in terms of severity occurring in 2022. 54,784 reported cases were recorded from all 77 districts in seven provinces. These diseases are simply in addition to other diseases that can be seen with the rise of global temperatures and air pollution. Many vulnerable groups are experiencing an increase in respiratory illness, cardiac illnesses, and asthma. The heat can lead to issues such as a strain on respiratory illnesses, heat stroke, and fever. There is also the increased risk of cancer. Many lower income communities such as the himalayan villages suffer from exposure to more pollution or in some cases exposure to toxic chemicals which has led to an increased rate of cancer in these communities as well as an increased risk of death.

===Agricultural impacts===

The increasing temperatures are also leading to a decrease in territory for local wildlife. This trend has decreased the prey populations of at-risk predators, such as snow leopards. Seeking alternative food sources, snow leopards and other predators attack local farmers&#x27; livestock. This livestock consists of yaks, oxen, horses, and goats. Snow leopards have killed about 2.6% of the local livestock per year in response to their shrinking habitat. The overall loss, about a quarter of the average income of local farmers, has had a major impact on the local economy. In retaliation, farmers have begun killing snow leopards, seeking to protect their livestock and their livelihoods.

===Policy changes===
Nepal is a part of the Paris agreement and thus is required to have a climate action plan and is being tracked by the Climate Action Tracker. According to the Climate Action Tracker, Nepal is &quot;almost sufficient&quot; on its track to reach the goals set by the Paris Agreement. There are two factors that hold Nepal back from reaching sufficient status and thus stand out. There is no Climate Finance Plan and emissions and temperature rising rate ranking at critically insufficient. Nepal has many goals, however, that are on track with the Paris Agreement. The first of note being a goal of net-zero emissions by 2045. To reach this goal Nepal submitted two separate plans to account for whatever future they experience the first being WAM (with additional measures) and the second being WEM (with existing measures). WEM is based primarily on already existing policies and highlights the energy sector as the main target for CO2 reduction. The WAM scenario introduces a far more ambitious strategy for reducing emissions. In this scenario the focus is primarily on an intervention method and disruption of the energy sector reducing the use of fossil fuels and the incorporation of renewable energy sources. This pathway heavily relies on reducing emissions from energy sources while preserving the carbon-absorbing capacity of the LULUCF (Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry) sector. Under this scenario, it is anticipated that net CO2 emissions will remain negative from 2020 to 2030, approach &#x27;zero&#x27; between 2035 and 2045, and then revert to negative values by 2050. The goal of this scenario is to accelerate the journey toward achieving carbon neutrality before 2045. These policies along with many more have Nepal on track to stay beneath the 1.5 threshold set by the Paris Agreement.

===Local adaptation===
In recent years many citizens of these Himalayan communities have started to notice the extreme effects of climate change by experiencing nature itself. They have noticed a decrease in precipitation especially in lowland districts, fluctuating temperatures during months of the year that are typically cooler, and changes in weather patterns even compared to early 2000s weather. Many local villagers have identified climate change simply through the availability of certain native plants decreasing or shifting seasons. The concept of climate change has now been aligned with the risk of natural disasters and has increased awareness in the local communities. These impacts of climate change have greatly affected agriculture in the area and has forced farmers to change crops and when they plant them. In response to this rather than push for policy change, citizens have begun to adapt to climate change. According to Dhungana, 91.94% of the respondents experienced drought as major climatic hazards then floods at 83.87%, landslides at 70.97%, and forest fires at 67.74%. In response to this citizens have begun adapting and adopting new practices. As a response to drought at the high altitudes, plantations are planting more protective trees, drought resistant plants, and have begun adopting irrigation practices drawing from nearby streams. In response to flooding, farmers have created more basins, dam construction, and small drainage canals.

The response to landslides includes plantation grasses in previously barren areas, Gabion wall construction, avoiding livestock grazing in landslide-prone areas, and a prohibition on tillage in areas at risk of landslides. To fight the increased rate of forest fires, citizens have begun beating the fires with green branches and mud, construction of fire lines, and are raising awareness about the wildfires. Fire lines are lines of varying width built through the leaf litter of a forest floor down to the soil and minerals to prevent a spread of fire past the line. The main reason for these adaptations is to decrease the risk that climate change poses over these marginalized communities while taking advantage of the moment and allowing for a positive change towards a more sustainable or adaptable future. Major barriers to these adaptations include a lack of funds, a lack of knowledge, a lack of technology, a lack of time, and lack of mandatory policy.

==Religions==

There are many cultural and mythological aspects associated with the Himalayas. In Jainism, Mount Ashtapada of the Himalayan mountain range is a sacred place where the first Jain &quot;tirthankara&quot;, Rishabhanatha, attained &quot;moksha&quot;. It is believed that after Rishabhanatha attained &quot;nirvana&quot;, his son, Bharata, had constructed three stupas and twenty four shrines of the 24 &quot;tirthankara&quot;s with their idols studded with precious stones over there and named it &quot;Sinhnishdha&quot;. For the Hindus, the Himalayas are personified as Himavat, the king of all mountains and the father of the goddess Parvati. The Himalayas are also considered to be the father of the goddess Ganga (the personification of river Ganges). Two of the most sacred places of pilgrimage for the Hindus are the temple complex in Pashupatinath and Muktinath, also known as Shaligrama because of the presence of the sacred black rocks called shaligrams.

The Buddhists also lay a great deal of importance on the Himalayas. Paro Taktsang is the holy place where Buddhism started in Bhutan. The Muktinath is also a place of pilgrimage for the Tibetan Buddhists. They believe that the trees in the poplar grove came from the walking sticks of eighty-four ancient Indian Buddhist magicians or &quot;mahasiddhas&quot;. They consider the saligrams to be representatives of the Tibetan serpent deity known as Gawo Jagpa. The Himalayan people&#x27;s diversity shows in many different ways. It shows through their architecture, their languages, and dialects, their beliefs and rituals, as well as their clothing. The shapes and materials of the people&#x27;s homes reflect their practical needs and beliefs. Another example of the diversity amongst the Himalayan peoples is that handwoven textiles display colors and patterns unique to their ethnic backgrounds. Finally, some people place great importance on jewelry. The Rai and Limbu women wear big gold earrings and nose rings to show their wealth through their jewelry. Several places in the Himalayas are of religious significance in, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Islam and Hinduism. A notable example of a religious site is Paro Taktsang, where Padmasambhava is said to have founded Buddhism in Bhutan.

A number of Vajrayana Buddhist sites are situated in the Himalayas, in Tibet, Bhutan, and in the Indian regions of Ladakh, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Spiti, and Darjeeling. There were over 6,000 monasteries in Tibet, including the residence of the Dalai Lama. Bhutan, Sikkim, and Ladakh are also dotted with numerous monasteries.

==Resources==
The Himalayas are home to a diversity of medicinal resources. Plants from the forests have been used for millennia to treat conditions ranging from simple coughs to snake bites. Different parts of the plants – root, flower, stem, leaves, and bark – are used as remedies for different ailments. For example, a bark extract from an &quot;Abies pindrow&quot; tree is used to treat coughs and bronchitis. Leaf and stem paste from an &quot;Andrachne cordifolia&quot; is used for wounds and as an antidote for snake bites. The bark of a &quot;Callicarpa arborea&quot; is used for skin ailments. Nearly a fifth of the gymnosperms, angiosperms, and pteridophytes in the Himalayas are found to have medicinal properties, and more are likely to be discovered.

Most of the population in some Asian and African countries depends on medicinal plants rather than prescriptions and such. Since so many people use medicinal plants as their only source of healing in the Himalayas, the plants are an important source of income. This contributes to economic and modern industrial development both inside and outside the region. The only problem is that locals are rapidly clearing the forests on the Himalayas for wood, often illegally.

<text>The Stimson Doctrine is the policy of nonrecognition of states created as a result of a war of aggression. The policy was implemented by the United States government, enunciated in a note of January 7, 1932, to the Empire of Japan and the Republic of China, of nonrecognition of international territorial changes imposed by force. The doctrine was an application of the principle of &quot;ex injuria jus non oritur&quot;. Since the entry into force of the United Nations Charter, international law scholars have argued that states are under a legal obligation not to recognize annexations as legitimate, but this view is controversial and not supported by consistent state practice.

Named after Henry L. Stimson, U.S. Secretary of State in the Herbert Hoover administration (1929–1933), the policy followed Japan&#x27;s unilateral seizure of Manchuria in northeastern China following action by Japanese soldiers in Shenyang on September 18, 1931. The doctrine was also invoked by U.S. Undersecretary of State Sumner Welles in the Welles Declaration on July 23, 1940, which announced nonrecognition of the Soviet annexation and incorporation of the three Baltic states: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. This remained the official U.S. position until the Baltic states regained independence in 1991.

It was not the first time that the U.S. had used nonrecognition as a political tool or symbolic statement. President Woodrow Wilson had refused to recognize the Mexican Revolutionary governments in 1913 and Japan&#x27;s Twenty-One Demands upon China in 1915.

The Japanese invasion of Manchuria in late 1931 placed Stimson in a difficult position. It was evident that appeals to the spirit of the Kellogg–Briand Pact had no impact on either the Chinese or the Japanese, and Stimson was further hampered by President Herbert Hoover&#x27;s clear indication that he would not support economic sanctions as a means to bring peace in the Far East.

On January 7, 1932, Stimson sent similar notes to China and Japan that incorporated a diplomatic approach that had been used by earlier secretaries facing crises in the Far East. Later known as the Stimson Doctrine or sometimes the Hoover-Stimson Doctrine the notes read in part as follows:

:[T]he American Government deems it to be its duty to notify both the Imperial Japanese Government and the Government of the Chinese Republic that it cannot admit the legality of any situation de facto nor does it intend to recognize any treaty or agreement entered into between those Governments, or agents thereof, which may impair the treaty rights of the United States or its citizens in China, including those that relate to the sovereignty, the independence, or the territorial and administrative integrity of the Republic of China, or to the international policy relative to China, commonly known as the open door policy; and that it does not intend to recognize any situation, treaty, or agreement which may be brought about by means contrary to the covenants and obligations of the Pact of Paris of August 27th, 1928, to which treaty both China and Japan as well as the United States are parties.

Stimson had stated that the U.S. would not recognize any changes made in China that would curtail American treaty rights in the area, that the &quot;open door&quot; must be maintained, and would refuse any legitimacy to territorial changes made in violation of the 1928 Pact. The declaration had few material effects on the Western world, which was burdened by the Great Depression, and Japan went on to establish a puppet state in Manchuria and later bomb Shanghai. The doctrine was criticized on the grounds that its only effect was to alienate the Japanese.

The Stimson Doctrine, originally intended only as a political declaration, attracted the attention of the League of Nations, which adopted a resolution on March 11, 1932 that &quot;it is incumbent upon members of the League of Nations not to recognize any situation, treaty or agreement which may be brought about by means contrary to the Covenant of the League of Nations or the Pact of Paris.&quot; It also acquired legal force for the members of the Organization of American States after it was included in the Saavedra Lamas Treaty and the Montevideo Convention of 1933, later followed by the Charter of the Organization of American States of 1948. 

After the entry into force of the UN Charter, international law establishes a general prohibition on the use of force. Consequently, international legal doctrine argues that annexations are illegal, and states are under a legal obligation to comply with the Stimson Doctrine by not recognizing as legitimate territorial changes made through annexations. This view, however, is controversial and not supported by consistent state practice.
