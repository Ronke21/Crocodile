<text>Mount St. Helens (known as Lawetlat&#x27;la to the local Cowlitz people, and Loowit or Louwala-Clough to the Klickitat) is an active stratovolcano located in Skamania County, Washington, in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It lies northeast of Portland, Oregon, and south of Seattle. Mount St. Helens takes its English name from that of the British diplomat Alleyne Fitzherbert, 1st Baron St Helens, a friend of explorer George Vancouver who surveyed the area in the late 18th century. The volcano is part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc, a segment of the Pacific Ring of Fire.

The Mount St. Helens major eruption of May 18, 1980, remains the deadliest and most economically destructive volcanic event in U.S. history. Fifty-seven people were killed; 200 homes, 47 bridges, of railways, and of highway were destroyed. A massive debris avalanche, triggered by a magnitude 5.1 earthquake, caused a lateral eruption that reduced the elevation of the mountain&#x27;s summit from , leaving a  wide horseshoe-shaped crater. The debris avalanche was in volume. The 1980 eruption disrupted terrestrial ecosystems near the volcano. By contrast, aquatic ecosystems in the area greatly benefited from the amounts of ash, allowing life to multiply rapidly. Six years after the eruption, most lakes in the area had returned to their normal state.

After its 1980 eruption, the volcano experienced continuous volcanic activity until 2008. Geologists predict that future eruptions will be more destructive, as the configuration of the lava domes requires more pressure to erupt. However, Mount St. Helens is a popular hiking spot and it is climbed year-round. In 1982, the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument was established by Congress.

==Geographic setting and description==
===General===

Mount St. Helens is west of Mount Adams, in the western part of the Cascade Range. Considered &quot;brother and sister&quot; mountains, the two volcanoes are approximately from Mount Rainier, the highest of the Cascade volcanoes. Mount Hood, the nearest major volcanic peak in Oregon, is southeast of Mount St. Helens.

Mount St. Helens is geologically young compared with the other major Cascade volcanoes. It formed only within the past 40,000 years, and the summit cone present before its 1980 eruption began rising about 2,200 years ago. The volcano is considered the most active in the Cascades within the Holocene epoch, which encompasses roughly the last 10,000 years.

Prior to the 1980 eruption, Mount St. Helens was the fifth-highest peak in Washington. It stood out prominently from surrounding hills because of the symmetry and extensive snow and ice cover of the pre-1980 summit cone, earning it the nickname, by some, &quot;Fuji-san of America&quot;. Its ice cover just prior to the 1980 eruption included eleven named glaciers: Wishbone, Loowit, Leschi, Forsyth, Nelson, Ape,
Shoestring, Swift, Dryer, Toutle, and Talus. Of these eleven, only the Shoestring Glacier revived somewhat post-eruption. The peak rose more than above its base, where the lower flanks merge with adjacent ridges. The mountain is across at its base, which is at an elevation of on the northeastern side and elsewhere. At the pre-eruption tree line, the width of the cone was .

Streams that originate on the volcano enter three main river systems: The Toutle River on the north and northwest, the Kalama River on the west, and the Lewis River on the south and east. The streams are fed by abundant rain and snow. The average annual rainfall is , and the snowpack on the mountain&#x27;s upper slopes can reach . The Lewis River is impounded by three dams for hydroelectric power generation. The southern and eastern sides of the volcano drain into an upstream impoundment, the Swift Reservoir, which is directly south of the volcano&#x27;s peak.

Although Mount St. Helens is in Skamania County, Washington, access routes to the mountain run through Cowlitz County to the west, and Lewis County to the north. State Route 504, locally known as the Spirit Lake Memorial Highway, connects with Interstate 5 at Exit 49, to the west of the mountain. That north–south highway skirts the low-lying cities of Castle Rock, Longview and Kelso along the Cowlitz River, and passes through the Vancouver, Washington–Portland, Oregon metropolitan area less than to the southwest. The community nearest the volcano is Cougar, Washington, in the Lewis River valley south-southwest of the peak. Gifford Pinchot National Forest surrounds Mount St. Helens.

===Crater Glacier and other new rock glaciers===
During the winter of 1980–1981, a new glacier appeared. Now officially named Crater Glacier, it was formerly known as the Tulutson Glacier. Shadowed by the crater walls and fed by heavy snowfall and repeated snow avalanches, it grew rapidly ( per year in thickness). By 2004, it covered about , and was divided by the dome into a western and eastern lobe. Typically, by late summer, the glacier looks dark from rockfall from the crater walls and ash from eruptions. As of 2006, the ice had an average thickness of and a maximum of , nearly as deep as the much older and larger Carbon Glacier of Mount Rainier. The ice is all post-1980, making the glacier very young geologically. However, the volume of the new glacier is about the same as all the pre-1980 glaciers combined.

From 2004, volcanic activity pushed aside the glacier lobes and upward by the growth of new volcanic domes. The surface of the glacier, once mostly without crevasses, turned into a chaotic jumble of icefalls heavily criss-crossed with crevasses and seracs caused by movement of the crater floor. The new domes have almost separated the Crater Glacier into an eastern and western lobe. Despite the volcanic activity, the termini of the glacier have still advanced, with a slight advance on the western lobe and a more considerable advance on the more shaded eastern lobe. Due to the advance, two lobes of the glacier joined in late May 2008 and thus the glacier completely surrounds the lava domes. In addition, since 2004, new glaciers have formed on the crater wall above Crater Glacier feeding rock and ice onto its surface below; there are two rock glaciers to the north of the eastern lobe of Crater Glacier.

===Climate===
Mount St. Helens has an alpine tundra climate (ET).

==Geology==
Mount St. Helens is part of the Cascades Volcanic Province, an arc-shaped band extending from southwestern British Columbia to Northern California, roughly parallel to the Pacific coastline. Beneath the Cascade Volcanic Province, a dense oceanic plate sinks beneath the North American Plate; a process known as subduction in geology. As the oceanic slab sinks deeper into the Earth&#x27;s interior beneath the continental plate, high temperatures and pressures allow water molecules locked in the minerals of solid rock to escape. The supercritical water rises into the pliable mantle above the subducting plate, causing some of the mantle to melt. This newly formed magma ascends upward through the crust along a path of least resistance, both by way of fractures and faults as well as by melting wall rocks. The addition of melted crust changes the geochemical composition. Some of the melt rises toward the Earth&#x27;s surface to erupt, forming the Cascade Volcanic Arc above the subduction zone.

The magma from the mantle has accumulated in two chambers below the volcano: one approximately below the surface, the other about . The lower chamber may be shared with Mount Adams and the Indian Heaven volcanic field.

===Ancestral stages of eruptive activity===
The early eruptive stages of Mount St. Helens are known as the &quot;Ape Canyon Stage&quot; (around 40,000–35,000 years ago), the &quot;Cougar Stage&quot; (ca. 20,000–18,000 years ago), and the &quot;Swift Creek Stage&quot; (roughly 13,000–8,000 years ago). The modern period, since about 2500 BC, is called the &quot;Spirit Lake Stage&quot;. Collectively, the pre–Spirit Lake stages are known as the &quot;ancestral stages&quot;. The ancestral and modern stages differ primarily in the composition of the erupted lavas; ancestral lavas consisted of a characteristic mixture of dacite and andesite, while modern lava is very diverse (ranging from olivine basalt to andesite and dacite).

St. Helens started its growth in the Pleistocene 37,600 years ago, during the Ape Canyon stage, with dacite and andesite eruptions of hot pumice and ash. Thirty-six thousand years ago a large mudflow cascaded down the volcano; mudflows were significant forces in all of St. Helens&#x27; eruptive cycles. The Ape Canyon eruptive period ended around 35,000 years ago and was followed by 17,000 years of relative quiet. Parts of this ancestral cone were fragmented and transported by glaciers 14,000–18,000 years ago during the last glacial period of the current ice age.

The second eruptive period, the Cougar Stage, started 20,000 years ago and lasted for 2,000 years. Pyroclastic flows of hot pumice and ash along with dome growth occurred during this period. Another 5,000 years of dormancy followed, only to be upset by the beginning of the Swift Creek eruptive period, typified by pyroclastic flows, dome growth and blanketing of the countryside with tephra. Swift Creek ended 8,000 years ago.

===Smith Creek and Pine Creek eruptive periods===
A dormancy of about 4,000 years was broken around 2500 BC with the start of the Smith Creek eruptive period, when eruptions of large amounts of ash and yellowish-brown pumice covered thousands of square miles. An eruption in 1900 BC was the largest known eruption from St. Helens during the Holocene epoch, depositing the Yn tephra. This eruptive period lasted until about 1600 BC and left deep deposits of material distant in what is now Mount Rainier National Park. Trace deposits have been found as far northeast as Banff National Park in Alberta, and as far southeast as eastern Oregon. All told there may have been up to of material ejected in this cycle. Some 400 years of dormancy followed.

St. Helens came alive again around 1200 BC—the Pine Creek eruptive period. This lasted until about 800 BC and was characterized by smaller-volume eruptions. Numerous dense, nearly red hot pyroclastic flows sped down St. Helens&#x27; flanks and came to rest in nearby valleys. A large mudflow partly filled of the Lewis River valley sometime between 1000 BC and 500 BC.

===Castle Creek and Sugar Bowl eruptive periods===

The next eruptive period, the Castle Creek period, began about 400 BC, and is characterized by a change in the composition of St. Helens&#x27; lava, with the addition of olivine and basalt. The pre-1980 summit cone started to form during the Castle Creek period. Significant lava flows in addition to the previously much more common fragmented and pulverized lavas and rocks (tephra) distinguished this period. Large lava flows of andesite and basalt covered parts of the mountain, including one around the year 100 BC that traveled all the way into the Lewis and Kalama river valleys. Others, such as Cave Basalt (known for its system of lava tubes), flowed up to from their vents. During the first century, mudflows moved down the Toutle and Kalama river valleys and may have reached the Columbia River. Another 400 years of dormancy ensued.

The Sugar Bowl eruptive period was short and markedly different from other periods in Mount St. Helens history. It produced the only unequivocal laterally directed blast known from Mount St. Helens before the 1980 eruptions. During Sugar Bowl time, the volcano first erupted quietly to produce a dome, then erupted violently at least twice producing a small volume of tephra, directed-blast deposits, pyroclastic flows, and lahars. East Dome, a small hypersthene-homblende dacite dome on the east slope of the volcano, was likely formed around the Sugar Bowl period. Formation of East Dome was preceded by an explosive eruption.

===Kalama and Goat Rocks eruptive periods===
Roughly 700 years of dormancy were broken in about 1480, when large amounts of pale gray dacite pumice and ash started to erupt, beginning the Kalama period. The 1480 eruption was several times larger than that of May 18, 1980. In 1482, another large eruption rivaling the 1980 eruption in volume is known to have occurred. Ash and pumice piled northeast of the volcano to a thickness of ; away, the ash was deep. Large pyroclastic flows and mudflows subsequently rushed down St. Helens&#x27; west flanks and into the Kalama River drainage system.

This 150-year period next saw the eruption of less silica-rich lava in the form of andesitic ash that formed at least eight alternating light- and dark-colored layers. Blocky andesite lava then flowed from St. Helens&#x27; summit crater down the volcano&#x27;s southeast flank. Later, pyroclastic flows raced down over the andesite lava and into the Kalama River valley. It ended with the emplacement of a dacite dome several hundred feet (~200 m) high at the volcano&#x27;s summit, which filled and overtopped an explosion crater already at the summit. Large parts of the dome&#x27;s sides broke away and mantled parts of the volcano&#x27;s cone with talus. Lateral explosions excavated a notch in the southeast crater wall. St. Helens reached its greatest height and achieved its highly symmetrical form by the time the Kalama eruptive cycle ended, in about 1647. The volcano remained quiet for the next 150 years.

The 57-year eruptive period that started in 1800 was named after the Goat Rocks dome and is the first period for which both oral and written records exist. As with the Kalama period, the Goat Rocks period started with an explosion of dacite tephra, followed by an andesite lava flow, and culminated with the emplacement of a dacite dome. The 1800 eruption probably rivaled the 1980 eruption in size, although it did not result in massive destruction of the cone. The ash drifted northeast over central and eastern Washington, northern Idaho, and western Montana. There were at least a dozen reported small eruptions of ash from 1831 to 1857, including a fairly large one in 1842. (The 1831 eruption is likely what tinted the sun bluish-green in Southampton County, Virginia on the afternoon of August 13—which Nat Turner interpreted as a final signal to launch the United States&#x27; largest slave rebellion.) The vent was apparently at or near Goat Rocks on the northeast flank. Goat Rocks dome was near the site of the bulge in the 1980 eruption, and it was obliterated in the major eruption event on May 18, 1980, that destroyed the entire north face and top of the mountain.

===Modern eruptive period===

====1980 to 2001 activity====

On March 20, 1980, Mount St. Helens experienced a magnitude 4.2 earthquake, and on March 27, steam venting started. By the end of April, the north side of the mountain had started to bulge. 
On May 18, a second earthquake, of magnitude 5.1, triggered a massive collapse of the north face of the mountain. It was the largest known debris avalanche in recorded history. The magma in St. Helens burst forth into a large-scale pyroclastic flow that flattened vegetation and buildings over an area of . More than 1.5 million metric tons of sulfur dioxide were released into the atmosphere. On the Volcanic Explosivity Index scale, the eruption was rated a 5, and categorized as a Plinian eruption.

The collapse of the northern flank of St. Helens mixed with ice, snow, and water to create lahars (volcanic mudflows). The lahars flowed many miles down the Toutle and Cowlitz Rivers, destroying bridges and lumber camps. A total of of material was transported south into the Columbia River by the mudflows.

For more than nine hours, a vigorous plume of ash erupted, eventually reaching above sea level. The plume moved eastward at an average speed of with ash reaching Idaho by noon. Ashes from the eruption were found on top of cars and roofs the next morning as far away as Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

By about 5:30 p.m. on May 18, the vertical ash column declined in stature, and less-severe outbursts continued through the night and for the next several days. The St. Helens May 18 eruption released 24 megatons of thermal energy and ejected more than of material. The removal of the north side of the mountain reduced St. Helens&#x27; height by about and left a crater wide and deep, with its north end open in a huge breach. The eruption killed 57 people, nearly 7,000 big-game animals (deer, elk, and bear), and an estimated 12 million fish from a hatchery. It destroyed or extensively damaged more than 200 homes, of highway, and of railways.

Between 1980 and 1986, activity continued at Mount St. Helens, with a new lava dome forming in the crater. Numerous small explosions and dome-building eruptions occurred. From December 7, 1989, to January 6, 1990, and from November 5, 1990, to February 14, 1991, the mountain erupted, sometimes huge clouds of ash.

====2004 to 2008 activity====
Magma reached the surface of the volcano about October 11, 2004, resulting in the building of a new lava dome on the existing dome&#x27;s south side. This new dome continued to grow throughout 2005 and into 2006. Several transient features were observed, such as a lava spine nicknamed the &quot;whaleback&quot;, which comprised long shafts of solidified magma being extruded by the pressure of magma beneath. These features were fragile and broke down soon after they were formed. On July 2, 2005, the tip of the whaleback broke off, causing a rockfall that sent ash and dust several hundred meters into the air.

Mount St. Helens showed significant activity on March 8, 2005, when a plume of steam and ash emerged—visible from Seattle. This relatively minor eruption was a release of pressure consistent with ongoing dome building. The release was accompanied by a magnitude 2.5 earthquake.

Another feature to emerge from the dome was called the &quot;fin&quot; or &quot;slab&quot;. Approximately half the size of a football field, the large, cooled volcanic rock was being forced upward as quickly as per day. In mid-June 2006, the slab was crumbling in frequent rockfalls, although it was still being extruded. The height of the dome was , still below the height reached in July 2005 when the whaleback collapsed.

On October 22, 2006, at 3:13 p.m. PST, a magnitude 3.5 earthquake broke loose Spine 7. The collapse and avalanche of the lava dome sent an ash plume over the western rim of the crater; the ash plume then rapidly dissipated.

On December 19, 2006, a large white plume of condensing steam was observed, leading some media people to assume there had been a small eruption. However, the Cascades Volcano Observatory of the USGS did not mention any significant ash plume. The volcano was in continuous eruption from October 2004, but this eruption consisted in large part of a gradual extrusion of lava forming a dome in the crater.

On January 16, 2008, steam began seeping from a fracture on top of the lava dome. Associated seismic activity was the most noteworthy since 2004. Scientists suspended activities in the crater and the mountain flanks, but the risk of a major eruption was deemed low. By the end of January, the eruption paused; no more lava was being extruded from the lava dome. On July 10, 2008, it was determined that the eruption had ended, after more than six months of no volcanic activity.

===Future hazards===

Future eruptions of Mount St. Helens will likely be even larger than the 1980 eruption. A large lahar flow is likely on branches of the Toutle River, possibly causing destruction in inhabited areas along the I-5 corridor.

The volcano is considered &quot;very high threat&quot; by the United States Geological Survey and is closely monitored by the Cascades Volcano Observatory.

==Ecology==

In its undisturbed state, the slopes of Mount St. Helens lie in the Western Cascades Montane Highlands ecoregion. This ecoregion has abundant precipitation; an average of of precipitation falls each year at Spirit Lake. This precipitation supported dense forest up to , with western hemlock, Douglas fir, and western redcedar. Above this, this forest was dominated by Pacific silver fir up to . Finally, below treeline, the forest consisted of mountain hemlock, Pacific silver fir and Alaska yellow cedar. Large mammals included Roosevelt elk, black-tailed deer, American black bear, and mountain lion.

The treeline at Mount St. Helens was unusually low, at about , the result of prior volcanic disturbance of the forest, as the treeline was thought to be moving up the slopes before the eruption. Alpine meadows were uncommon at Mount St. Helens. Mountain goats inhabited higher elevations of the peak, although their population was eliminated by the 1980 eruption.

===Ecological disturbance caused by eruption===
The eruption of Mount St. Helens has been subject to more ecological study than has any other eruption, because research into disturbance commenced immediately after the eruption and because the eruption did not sterilize the immediate area. More than half of the papers on ecological response to volcanic eruption originated from studies of Mount St. Helens.

Perhaps the most important ecological concept originating from the study of Mount St. Helens is the biological legacy. Biological legacies are the survivors of catastrophic disturbance; they can either be alive (e.g., plants that survive ashfall or pyroclastic flow), organic debris, or biotic patterns remaining from before the disturbance. These biological legacies highly influence the reestablishment of the post-disturbance ecology.

Some species from each trophic level survived the 1980 eruption, which allowed for relatively quick re-establishment of food webs. Larger species saw greater mortality rates, with each of the area&#x27;s large mammals — mountain goats, elk, deer, black bear and cougars — completely decimated. Eventually, each of the larger mammals migrated back into the area. Without access to adequate forage, many elk starved to death in the winters in the following decades. By 2014, the mountain goat population had grown back to 65 members. In 2015, there were 152. Mountain goats are culturally significant to the Cowlitz Tribe, whose members historically harvested shed tufts of goat wool left behind on the mountain, and the tribe has played a role in monitoring the population, which continues to recover without human intervention.

==Human history==
===Importance to indigenous tribes===
Native American lore contains numerous stories to explain the eruptions of Mount St. Helens and other Cascade volcanoes. The best known of these is the Bridge of the Gods story told by the Klickitat people.
In the story, the chief of all the gods and his two sons, Pahto (also called Klickitat) and Wy&#x27;east, traveled down the Columbia River from the Far North in search for a suitable area to settle.

They came upon an area that is now called The Dalles and thought they had never seen a land so beautiful. The sons quarreled over the land, so to solve the dispute their father shot two arrows from his mighty bow – one to the north and the other to the south. Pahto followed the arrow to the north and settled there while Wy&#x27;east did the same for the arrow to the south. The chief of the gods then built the Bridge of the Gods, so his family could meet periodically.

When the two sons of the chief of the gods fell in love with a beautiful maiden named Loowit, she could not choose between them. The two young chiefs fought over her, burying villages and forests in the process. The area was devastated and the earth shook so violently that the huge bridge fell into the river, creating the cascades of the Columbia River Gorge.

For punishment, the chief of the gods struck down each of the lovers and transformed them into great mountains where they fell. Wy&#x27;east, with his head lifted in pride, became the volcano known today as Mount Hood. Pahto, with his head bent toward his fallen love, was turned into Mount Adams. The beautiful Loowit became Mount St. Helens, known to the Klickitats as Louwala-Clough, which means &quot;smoking or fire mountain&quot; in their language (the Sahaptin call the mountain Loowit).
The mountain is also of sacred importance to the Cowlitz and Yakama tribes that also live in the area. They find the area above its tree line to be of exceptional spiritual significance, and the mountain (which they call &quot;Lawetlat&#x27;la&quot;, roughly translated as &quot;the smoker&quot;) features prominently in their creation story, and in some of their songs and rituals. In recognition of its cultural significance, over of the mountain (roughly bounded by the Loowit Trail) have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Other area tribal names for the mountain include &quot;nšh&#x27;ák&#x27;w&quot; (&quot;water coming out&quot;) from the Upper Chehalis, and &quot;aka akn&quot; (&quot;snow mountain&quot;), a Kiksht term.

===Exploration by Europeans===
Royal Navy Commander George Vancouver and the officers of HMS &quot;Discovery&quot; made the Europeans&#x27; first recorded sighting of Mount St. Helens on 19 May 1792, while surveying the northern Pacific Ocean coast. Vancouver named the mountain for British diplomat Alleyne Fitzherbert, 1st Baron St Helens on 20 October 1792, as it came into view when the &quot;Discovery&quot; passed into the mouth of the Columbia River.

Years later, explorers, traders, and missionaries heard reports of an erupting volcano in the area. Geologists and historians determined much later that the eruption took place in 1800, marking the beginning of the 57 year-long Goat Rocks Eruptive Period (see geology section). Alarmed by the &quot;dry snow&quot;, the Nespelem tribe of northeastern Washington supposedly danced and prayed rather than collecting food and suffered during that winter from starvation.

In late 1805 and early 1806, members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition spotted Mount St. Helens from the Columbia River but did not report either an ongoing eruption or recent evidence of one. They did however report the presence of quicksand and clogged channel conditions at the mouth of the Sandy River near Portland, suggesting an eruption by Mount Hood sometime in the previous decades.

In 1829, Hall J. Kelley led a campaign to rename the Cascade Range as the President&#x27;s Range and also to rename each major Cascade mountain after a former President of the United States. In his scheme Mount St. Helens was to be renamed Mount Washington.

===European colonization and use of the area===
The first authenticated non-Indigenous eyewitness report of a volcanic eruption was made in March 1835 by Meredith Gairdner, while working for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company stationed at Fort Vancouver. He sent an account to the &quot;Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal&quot;, which published his letter in January 1836. James Dwight Dana of Yale University, while sailing with the United States Exploring Expedition, saw the quiescent peak from off the mouth of the Columbia River in 1841. Another member of the expedition later described &quot;cellular basaltic lavas&quot; at the mountain&#x27;s base.

In the late fall or early winter of 1842, nearby European settlers and missionaries witnessed the so-called Great Eruption. This small-volume outburst created large ash clouds, and mild explosions followed for 15 years. The eruptions of this period were likely phreatic (steam explosions). Josiah Parrish in Champoeg, Oregon witnessed Mount St. Helens in eruption on 22 November 1842. Ash from this eruption may have reached The Dalles, Oregon, southeast of the volcano.

In October 1843, future California governor Peter H. Burnett recounted a very likely apocryphal story of an Indigenous man who badly burned his foot and leg in lava or hot ash while hunting for deer. The story went that the injured man sought treatment at Fort Vancouver, but the contemporary fort commissary steward, Napoleon McGilvery, disclaimed knowledge of the incident. British lieutenant Henry J. Warre sketched the eruption in 1845, and two years later Canadian painter Paul Kane created watercolors of the gently smoking mountain. Warre&#x27;s work showed erupting material from a vent about a third of the way down from the summit on the mountain&#x27;s west or northwest side (possibly at Goat Rocks), and one of Kane&#x27;s field sketches shows smoke emanating from about the same location.

On April 17, 1857, the &quot;Republican&quot;, a Steilacoom, Washington, newspaper, reported that &quot;Mount St. Helens, or some other mount to the southward, is seen ... to be in a state of eruption&quot;. The lack of a significant ash layer associated with this event indicates that it was a small eruption. This was the first reported volcanic activity since 1854.

Before the 1980 eruption, Spirit Lake offered year-round recreational activities. In the summer there was boating, swimming, and camping, while in the winter there was skiing.

===Human impact from the 1980 eruption===
Fifty-seven people were killed during the eruption. Had the eruption occurred one day later, when loggers would have been at work, rather than on a Sunday, the death toll could have been much higher.

Eighty-three-year-old Harry R. Truman, who ran the Spirit Lake Lodge and had lived near the mountain since 1929, gained much media attention when he decided not to evacuate before the impending eruption, despite repeated pleas by local authorities. His body was never found after the eruption.

Another victim of the eruption was 30-year-old volcanologist David A. Johnston, who was stationed on the nearby Coldwater Ridge. Moments before his position was hit by the pyroclastic flow, Johnston radioed his last words: &quot;Vancouver! Vancouver! This is it!&quot; Johnston&#x27;s body was never found. Robert Landsburg was another victim, a photographer who took pictures of the approaching ash cloud. He placed his camera in his backpack and laid on top of it to protect the film. His body and the camera were found on June 4, 1980. The photos survived and provided geologists with valuable documentation of the eruption.

U.S. President Jimmy Carter surveyed the damage and said, &quot;Someone said this area looked like a moonscape. But the moon looks more like a golf course compared to what&#x27;s up there.&quot; A film crew, led by Seattle filmmaker Otto Seiber, was dropped by helicopter on St. Helens on May 23 to document the destruction. Their compasses, however, spun in circles and they quickly became lost. A second eruption occurred on May 25, but the crew survived and was rescued two days later by National Guard helicopter pilots. Their film, &quot; The Eruption of Mount St. Helens!&quot;, later became a popular documentary.

The eruption had negative effects beyond the immediate area of the volcano. Ashfall caused approximately $100 million of damage to agriculture downwind in Eastern Washington, equivalent to $ in .

The eruption also had positive impacts on society. Apple and wheat production were higher in the 1980 growing season, possibly due to ash helping to retain moisture in the soil. The ash was also a source of income: it was the raw material for the artificial gemstone helenite, or for ceramic glazes, or sold as a tourist curio.

===Protection and later history===

In 1982, President Ronald Reagan and the U.S. Congress established the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument, a area around the mountain and within the Gifford Pinchot National Forest.

Following the 1980 eruption, the area was left to gradually return to its natural state. In 1987, the U.S. Forest Service reopened the mountain to climbing. It remained open until 2004 when renewed activity caused the closure of the area around the mountain (see &quot;Geological history&quot; section above for more details). The Monitor Ridge trail, which previously let up to 100 permitted hikers per day climb to the summit, ceased operation. On July 21, 2006, the mountain was again opened to climbers. In February 2010, a climber died after falling from the rim into the crater.

Due to the eruption, the state recognizes the month of May as &quot;Volcano Awareness Month&quot; and events are held at Mt. St. Helens, or within the region, to discuss the eruption, safety concerns, and to commemorate lives lost during the natural disaster.

On May 14, 2023, a mudslide and debris flow given the moniker, South Coldwater Slide by the U.S. Forest Service, destroyed the Spirit Lake Outlet Bridge on Washington State Route 504 and cut off access to the Johnston Ridge Observatory. Closures and access to Coldwater Lake and hiking trails would vary in the month after the slide.

==Climbing and recreation==
Mount St. Helens is a common climbing destination for both beginning and experienced mountaineers. The peak is climbed year-round, although it is more often climbed from late spring through early fall. All routes include sections of steep, rugged terrain. A permit system has been in place for climbers since 1987. A climbing permit is required year-round for anyone who will be above on the slopes of Mount St. Helens.

The standard hiking/mountaineering route in the warmer months is the Monitor Ridge Route, which starts at the Climbers Bivouac. This is the most crowded route to the summit in the summer and gains about in approximately to reach the crater rim. Although strenuous, it is considered a non-technical climb that involves some scrambling. Most climbers complete the round trip in 7 to 12 hours.

The Worm Flows Route is considered the standard winter route on Mount St. Helens, as it is the most direct route to the summit. The route gains about in elevation over about from trailhead to summit but does not demand the technical climbing that some other Cascade peaks like Mount Rainier do. The route name refers to the rocky lava flows that surround the route. This route can be accessed via the Marble Mountain Sno-Park and the Swift Ski Trail.

The mountain is now circled by the Loowit Trail at elevations of . The northern segment of the trail from the South Fork Toutle River on the west to Windy Pass on the east is a restricted zone where camping, biking, pets, fires, and off-trail excursions are all prohibited.

On April 14, 2008, John Slemp, a snowmobiler from Damascus, Oregon, fell 1,500 feet into the crater after a snow cornice gave way beneath him on a trip to the volcano with his son. Despite his long fall, Slemp survived with minor injuries, and was able to walk after coming to a stop at the foot of the crater wall, where he was rescued by a mountain rescue helicopter.

A visitor center run by the Washington State Parks is in Silver Lake, Washington, about west of Mount St. Helens. Exhibits include a large model of the volcano, a seismograph, a theater program, and an outdoor natural trail.

<doc id="36653" wikidata="Q6887152" url="?curid=36653" title="Mobile magazine explosion">
<text>On May 25, 1865, in Mobile, Alabama, in the Southern United States, an ordnance depot or &quot;magazine&quot; exploded, killing some 300 persons. This event occurred just before the end of the American Civil War, during the occupation of the city by Federal troops.

The depot was a warehouse on Beauregard Street, where the troops had stacked some 200 tons of shells and powder. Some time in the afternoon of May 25, a cloud of black smoke rose into the air and the ground began to rumble. Flames shot up into the sky and bursting shells were heard throughout the city. In the nearby Mobile River, two ships sank, and a man standing on a wharf was blown into the river. Several houses collapsed from the concussion.

A reporter for &quot;The Mobile Morning News&quot; newspaper described &quot;bursting shells, flying timbers, bales of cotton, horses, men, women, and children co-mingled and mangled into one immense mass&quot;. He continued: &quot;The heart stood still, and the stoutest cheek paled as this rain of death fell from the sky and crash after crash foretold a more fearful fate yet impending ... old and young, soldier and citizen vied with each other in deeds of daring to rescue the crumbled and imprisoned.&quot;

On the heels of the explosion came fires, which burned until the entire northern part of Mobile lay in smoking ruins. A huge hole where the warehouse once stood remained for many years, a reminder of the disaster.

The exact cause of the magazine explosion was never determined. Some northern newspapers tried to pin the blame on an imagined gang of unreconstructed Confederate officers. Most people, though, accepted that it was the result of simple carelessness on the part of workers handling wheelbarrows full of live ammunition.

<doc id="36656" wikidata="Q28575" url="?curid=36656" title="County">
<text>A county () is a geographic region of a country used for administrative or other purposes in some nations. The term is derived from the Old French denoting a jurisdiction under the sovereignty of a count (earl) or, in his stead, a viscount (&quot;vicomte&quot;). Literal equivalents in other languages, derived from the equivalent of &quot;count&quot;, are now seldom used officially, including , , , , , , , and &quot;zhupa&quot; in Slavic languages; terms equivalent to &#x27;commune&#x27; or &#x27;community&#x27; are now often instead used.

When the Normans conquered England, they brought the term with them. Although there were at first no counts, &quot;vicomtes&quot; or counties in Anglo-Norman England, the earlier Anglo-Saxons did have earls, sheriffs and shires. The shires were the districts that became the historic counties of England, and given the same Latin translation &quot;comitatus&quot;. Many English county names derive from the name of the county town (county seat) with the word &quot;shire&quot; added on, for example Gloucestershire and Worcestershire. The term &quot;county&quot; evolved to designate a level of local administration that was immediately beneath a national government, within a unitary (non-federal) system of government. &quot;County&quot; later also became used differently in some federal systems of government, for a local administrative division subordinate to a primary subnational entity, such as a Province (e.g. Canada) or a level 3 territorial unit such as NUTS 3 (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics – Level 3).

Examples include the United States and Canada, which evolved from British colonial North America and inherited British governmental traditions, where counties often remain as local administrative divisions that evolved from historic (pre-federal) counties governed by courts/magistracy.

A county may be further subdivided into smaller jurisdictions such as hundreds, or townships. A county usually, but not always, contains cities, towns, townships, villages, or other municipal corporations, which in most cases are somewhat subordinate or dependent upon county governments. Depending on the nation, municipality, and local geography, municipalities may or may not be subject to direct or indirect county control. The functions of both levels are often consolidated into a city government when the area is densely populated, and are generally not when it is less densely populated.

Outside English-speaking countries, an equivalent of the term &quot;county&quot; is often used to describe subnational jurisdictions that are structurally equivalent to counties in the relationship they have with their national government; but which may not be administratively equivalent to counties in predominantly English-speaking countries.

===Kenya===
Counties are the current second-level political division in Kenya. Each county has an assembly where members of the county assembly (MCAs) sit. This assembly is headed by a governor. Each county is also represented in the Senate of Kenya by a senator. Additionally, a women&#x27;s representative is elected from each county to the Parliament of Kenya to represent women&#x27;s interests. Counties replaced provinces as the second-level division after the promulgation of the 2010 Constitution of Kenya.

===Liberia===
Liberia has 15 counties, each of which elects two senators to the Senate of Liberia.

===China===

The English word &quot;county&quot; is used to translate the Chinese term ( or ). In Mainland China, governed by the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), counties and county-level divisions are the third level of regional/local government, coming under the provincial level and the prefectural level, and above the township level and village level.

There are 1,464 so-named &quot;counties&quot; out of 2,862 county-level divisions in the PRC, and the number of counties has remained more or less constant since the Han dynasty (206 BC – AD 220). It remains one of the oldest titles of local-level government in China and significantly predates the establishment of provinces in the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368). The county government was particularly important in imperial China because this was the lowest level at which the imperial government is functionally involved, while below it the local people are managed predominantly by the gentries. The head of a county government during imperial China was the magistrate, who was often a newly ascended &quot;jinshi&quot;.

In older context, &quot;district&quot; was an older English translation of before the establishment of the Republic of China (ROC). The English nomenclature &quot;county&quot; was adopted following the establishment of the ROC. In addition, provincial cities have the same level of authority as counties. Above county, there are special municipalities (in effect) and province (suspended due to economical and political reasons). There are currently 13 counties in the ROC-controlled territories.

During most of the imperial era, there were no concepts like municipalities in China. All cities existed within counties, commanderies, prefectures, etc., and had no governments of their own. Large cities (must be imperial capitals or seats of prefectures) could be divided and administered by two or three counties. Such counties are called 倚郭縣 (, &#x27;county leaning on the city walls&#x27;) or (, &#x27;county attached to the city walls&#x27;). The yamen or governmental houses of these counties exist in the same city. In other words, they share one county town. In this sense, a or is similar to a district of a city.

For example, the city of Guangzhou (seat of the eponymous prefecture, also known as &quot;Canton&quot; in the Western world) was historically divided by Nanhai County () and Panyu County (). When the first modern city government in China was established in Guangzhou, the urban area was separated from these two counties, with the rural areas left in the remaining parts of them. However, the county governments remained in the city for years, before moving into the respective counties. Similar processes happened in many Chinese cities.

Nowadays, most counties in mainland China, i.e. with &quot;Xian&quot; in their titles, are administered by prefecture-level cities and have mainly agricultural economies and rural populations.

===Indonesia===

Regency (&quot;kabupaten&quot;) in Indonesia is an administrative unit under a province that is equivalent to a city. A regency is headed by a regent who is directly elected by the people, and is responsible for public services such as education, health, and infrastructure. The structure of a regency includes several districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;) which are further divided into villages or ward. Regency in Indonesia is similar to the concept of &quot;county&quot; in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, but with differences in cultural context and government system. Indonesia has more than 400 regencies spread across all provinces.

===Iran===

The ostans (provinces) of Iran are further subdivided into counties called (). County consists of a city centre, a few (), and many villages around them. There are usually a few cities (, ) and rural agglomerations (, ) in each county. Rural agglomerations are a collection of a number of villages. One of the cities of the county is appointed as the capital of the county.

Each has a government office known as (), which coordinates different events and government offices. The , or the head of , is the governor of the .

Fars province has the highest number of , with 36, while Qom uniquely has one, being with its namesake county. Iran had 324 in 2005 and 443 in 2021.

===Korea===
County is the common English translation for the character ( or ) that denotes the current second level political division in South Korea. In North Korea, the county is one type of municipal-level division.

==Europe==
===Denmark===
Denmark was divided into counties () from 1662 to 2006. On 1 January 2007 the counties were replaced by five Regions. At the same time, the number of municipalities was slashed to 98.

The counties were first introduced in 1662, replacing the 49 fiefs () in Denmark–Norway with the same number of counties. This number does not include the subdivisions of the Duchy of Schleswig, which was only under partial Danish control. The number of counties in Denmark (excluding Norway) had dropped to around 20 by 1793. Following the reunification of South Jutland with Denmark in 1920, four counties replaced the Prussian . Aabenraa and Sønderborg County merged in 1932 and Skanderborg and Aarhus were separated in 1942. From 1942 to 1970, the number stayed at 22. The number was further decreased by the 1970 Danish municipal reform, leaving 14 counties plus two cities unconnected to the county structure; Copenhagen and Frederiksberg.

In 2003, Bornholm County merged with the local five municipalities, forming the Bornholm Regional Municipality. The remaining 13 counties were abolished on 1 January 2007 where they were replaced by five new regions. In the same reform, the number of municipalities was slashed from 270 to 98 and all municipalities now belong to a region.

===France===


A was a territory ruled by a count () in medieval France. In modern France, the rough equivalent of a county as used in many English-speaking countries is a department (). Ninety-six departments are in metropolitan France, and five are overseas departments, which are also classified as overseas regions. Departments are further subdivided into 334 arrondissements, but these have no autonomy; they are the basis of local organisation of police, fire departments and, sometimes, administration of elections.

===Germany===

Each administrative district consists of an elected council and an executive, and whose duties are comparable to those of a county executive in the United States, supervising local government administration. Historically, counties in the Holy Roman Empire were called .
The majority of German districts are &quot;rural districts&quot; (German: ), of which there are 294 . Cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants (and smaller towns in some states) do not usually belong to a district, but take on district responsibilities themselves, similar to the concept of independent cities and there are 107 of them, bringing the total number of districts to 401.

===Hungary===
The administrative unit of Hungary is called (between 1950 and 2022 they were called , historically also in Latin), which can be translated with the word &quot;county&quot;. The two names are used interchangeably (&#x27;megye&#x27; used in common parlance, and when referring to the counties of other states), just like before 1950, when the word &#x27;megye&#x27; even appeared in legal texts. The 19 counties constitute the highest level of the administrative subdivisions of the country together with the capital city Budapest, although counties and the capital are grouped into seven statistical regions.

Counties are subdivided into districts () and municipalities, the two types of which are towns (&quot;város&quot;) and villages (&quot;község&quot;), each one having their own elected mayor and council. 23 of the towns have the rights of a county although they do not form independent territorial units equal to counties.

The was also the historic administrative unit in the Kingdom of Hungary, which included areas of present-day neighbouring countries of Hungary. Its Latin name () is the equivalent of the French . Actual political and administrative role of counties changed much through history. Originally they were subdivisions of the royal administration, but from the 13th century they became self-governments of the nobles and kept this character until the 19th century when in turn they became modern local governments.

===Ireland===

The island of Ireland was historically divided into 32 counties, of which 26 later formed the Republic of Ireland and 6 made up Northern Ireland.

These counties are traditionally grouped into four provinces: Leinster (12 counties), Munster (6), Connacht (5) and Ulster (9). Historically, the counties of Meath and Westmeath and small parts of surrounding counties constituted the province of Mide, which was one of the &quot;Five Fifths&quot; of Ireland (in the Irish language the word for province, , means &#x27;a fifth&#x27;: from , &#x27;five&#x27;); however, these have long since been absorbed into Leinster. In the Republic each county is administered by an elected &quot;county council&quot;, and the old provincial divisions are merely traditional names with no political significance.

The number and boundaries of administrative counties in the Republic of Ireland were reformed in the 1990s. For example, County Dublin was divided into three: Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, Fingal, and South Dublin; the City of Dublin had existed for centuries before. The cities of Cork and Galway have been separated from the town and rural areas of their counties. The cities of Limerick and Waterford were merged with their respective counties in 2014. Thus, the Republic of Ireland now has 31 &#x27;county-level&#x27; authorities, although the borders of the original twenty-six counties are still officially in place.

In Northern Ireland, the six county councils and the smaller town councils were abolished in 1973 and replaced by a single tier of local government. However, in the north as well as in the south, the traditional 32 counties and 4 provinces remain in common usage for many sporting, cultural and other purposes. County identity is heavily reinforced in the local culture by allegiances to county teams in hurling and Gaelic football. Each Gaelic Athletic Association county has its own flag/colours (and often a nickname), and county allegiances are taken quite seriously. See the counties of Ireland and the Gaelic Athletic Association.

===Italy===
In Italy the word &quot;county&quot; is not used; the administrative sub-division of a region is called . Italian provinces are mainly named after their principal town and comprise several administrative subdivisions called (&#x27;communes&#x27;). There are currently 110 provinces in Italy.

In the context of pre-modern Italy, the Italian word generally refers to the countryside surrounding, and controlled by, the city state. The provided natural resources and agricultural products to sustain the urban population. In contemporary usage, can refer to a metropolitan area, and in some cases large rural/suburban regions providing resources to distant cities.

===Lithuania===
 (plural ) is the Lithuanian word for county. Since 1994 Lithuania has 10 counties; before 1950 it had 20. The only purpose with the county is an office of a state governor who shall conduct law and order in the county.

===Norway===
Norway has been divided into 11 counties (, ; singular: ) since 2020; they previously numbered 19 following a local government reform in 1972. Until that year Bergen was a separate county, but today it is a municipality within the county of Vestland. All counties form administrative entities called county municipalities ( or ; singular: ), further subdivided into municipalities ( or ; singular: ). One county, Oslo, is not divided into municipalities, rather it is equivalent to the municipality of Oslo.

Each county has its own county council () whose representatives are elected every four years together with representatives to the municipal councils. The counties handle matters such as high schools and local roads, and until 1 January 2002 hospitals as well. This last responsibility was transferred to the state-run health authorities and health trusts, and there is a debate on the future of the county municipality as an administrative entity. Some people, and parties, such as the Conservative and Progress Party, call for the abolition of the county municipalities once and for all, while others, including the Labour Party, merely want to merge some of them into larger regions.

===Poland===

The territorial administration of Poland since 1999 has been based on three levels of subdivision. The country is divided into &quot;voivodeships&quot; (provinces); these are further divided into &quot;powiats&quot;. The term &quot;powiat&quot; is often translated into English as &quot;county&quot; (or sometimes &quot;district&quot;). In historical contexts this may be confusing because the Polish term &quot;hrabstwo&quot; (a territorial unit administered/owned by a &quot;hrabia&quot;, count) is also literally translated as &quot;county&quot; and it was subordinated under &quot;powiat&quot;.

The 380 county-level entities in Poland include 314 &quot;land counties&quot; (powiaty ziemskie) and the 66 &quot;city counties&quot; (&quot;miasta na prawach powiatu&quot; or &quot;powiaty grodzkie&quot;) . They are subdivisions of the 16 &quot;voivodeship&quot;, and are further subdivided into 2,477 gminas (also called commune or municipality).

===Romania===

The Romanian word for county, , is not currently used for any Romanian administrative divisions. Romania is divided into a total of 41 counties (), which along with the municipality of Bucharest, constitute the official administrative divisions of Romania. They represent the country&#x27;s NUTS-3 (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics – Level 3) statistical subdivisions within the European Union and each of them serves as the local level of government within its borders. Most counties are named after a major river, while some are named after notable cities within them, such as the county seat.

===Sweden===
The Swedish division into counties, , which literally means &#x27;fief&#x27;, was established in 1634, and was based on an earlier division into provinces; Sweden is divided into 21 counties and 290 municipalities (&quot;kommuner&quot;). At the county level there is a county administrative board led by a governor appointed by the central government of Sweden, as well as an elected county council that handles a separate set of issues, notably hospitals and public transportation for the municipalities within its borders. The counties and their expanse have changed several times, most recently in 1998.

Every county council corresponds to a county with a number of municipalities per county. County councils and municipalities have different roles and separate responsibilities relating to local government. Health care, public transport and certain cultural institutions are administered by county councils while general education, public water utilities, garbage disposal, elderly care and rescue services are administered by the municipalities. Gotland is a special case of being a county council with only one municipality and the functions of county council and municipality are performed by the same organisation.

=== Ukraine ===
In Ukraine the county () was introduced in Ukrainian territories under Poland in the second half of the 14th century, and in the eighteenth century under the Russian Empire in the Cossack Hetmanate, Sloboda Ukraine, Southern Ukraine, and Right-Bank Ukraine. In 1913 there were 126 counties in Ukrainian-inhabited territories of the Russian Empire. Under the Austrian Empire in 1914 there were 59 counties in Ukrainian-inhabited Galicia, 34 in Transcarpathia, and 10 in Bukovina. Counties were retained by the independent Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic of 1917–1921, and in Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Romania until the Soviet annexations at the start of World War II. 99 counties formed the Ukrainian SSR in 1919, where they were abolished in 1923–25 in favour of 53 okruhas (in turn replaced by oblasts in 1930–32), although they existed in the Zakarpattia Oblast until 1953.

===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom is divided into a number of metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties. There are also ceremonial counties which group small non-metropolitan counties into geographical areas broadly based on the historic counties of England. In 1974, the metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties replaced the system of administrative counties and county boroughs which was introduced in 1889. The counties generally belong to level 3 of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS 3).

In 1965 and 1974–1975, major reorganisations of local government in England and Wales created several new administrative counties such as Hereford and Worcester (abolished again in 1998 and reverted, with some transfers of territory, to the two separate historic counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire) and also created several new metropolitan counties based on large urban areas as a single administrative unit. In Scotland, county-level local government was replaced by larger regions, which lasted until 1996. Modern local government in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and a large part of England is trending towards smaller unitary authorities: a system similar to that proposed in the 1960s by the Redcliffe-Maud Report for most of Britain.

The name &quot;county&quot; was introduced by the Normans, and was derived from a Norman term for an area administered by a Count (lord). These Norman &quot;counties&quot; were simply the Saxon shires, and kept their Saxon names. Several traditional counties, including Essex, Sussex and Kent, predate the unification of England by Alfred the Great, and were originally more or less independent kingdoms (although the most important Saxon Kingdom on the island of Britain, Alfred&#x27;s own Wessex, no longer survives in any form).

====England====
In England, in the Anglo-Saxon period, &quot;shires&quot; were established as areas used for the raising of taxes, and usually had a fortified town at their centre. This became known as the &quot;shire town&quot; or later the county town. In many cases, the shires were named after their shire town (for example Bedford&quot;shire&quot;), but there are several exceptions, such as Cumberland, Norfolk and Suffolk. In several other cases, such as Buckinghamshire, the modern county town is different from the town after which the shire is named. (See Toponymical list of counties of the United Kingdom)

Most non-metropolitan counties in England are run by county councils and are divided into non-metropolitan districts, each with its own council. Local authorities in the UK are usually responsible for education, emergency services, planning, transport, social services, and a number of other functions.

Until 1974, the county boundaries of England changed little over time. In the medieval period, a number of important cities were granted the status of counties in their own right, such as London, Bristol and Coventry, and numerous small exclaves such as Islandshire were created. In 1844, most of these exclaves were transferred to their surrounding counties.

====Northern Ireland====
In Northern Ireland, the six county councils, if not their counties, were abolished in 1973 and replaced by 26 local government districts. The traditional six counties remain in common everyday use for many cultural and other purposes.

====Scotland and Wales====

The thirteen historic counties of Wales were fixed by statute in 1539 (although counties such as Pembrokeshire date from 1138) and most of the shires of Scotland are of at least this age. The Welsh word for county is &quot;sir&quot; which is derived from the English &#x27;shire&#x27;. The word is officially used to signify counties in Wales. In the Gaelic form, Scottish traditional county names are generally distinguished by the designation —literally &quot;sheriffdom&quot;, e.g. (Argyllshire). This term corresponds to the jurisdiction of the sheriff in the Scottish legal system.

== North America ==
===Canada===
====Alberta====
A &quot;county&quot; in Alberta used to be a type of designation in a single-tier municipal system; but this was nominally changed to &quot;municipal district&quot; under the &quot;Municipal Government Act&quot;, when the &quot;County Act&quot; was repealed in the mid-1990s. However, at the time the new &quot;municipal districts&quot; were also permitted to retain the usage of &quot;county&quot; in their official names.

As a result, in Alberta, the term &quot;county&quot; is synonymous with the term &quot;municipal district&quot; – it is not its own incorporated municipal status that is different from that of a municipal district. As such, Alberta Municipal Affairs provides municipal districts with the opportunity to change to a &quot;county&quot; in their official names, but some have chosen to hold out with the &quot;municipal district&quot; title. The vast majority of &quot;municipal districts&quot; in Alberta are counties.

====British Columbia====
British Columbia has counties for the purposes of its justice system but otherwise they hold no governmental function. For the provision of all other governmental services, the province is divided into regional districts that form the upper tier, which are further subdivided into local municipalities that are partly autonomous, and unincorporated electoral areas that are governed directly by the regional districts.

====Manitoba====
The province of Manitoba was divided into counties; however, these counties were abolished in 1890. Manitoba is divided into rural municipalities, which do not overlap with urban municipalities.

====New Brunswick====
The counties of New Brunswick were upper-tier governance units until the municipal reform of 1967; they were also used as electoral districts until 1973. They remain in use as census divisions by Statistics Canada and by locals as geographic identifiers. The Territorial Division Act defining them remains in effect; their subdivisions are called parishes; their government centres are called Shiretowns.

====Newfoundland and Labrador====
Newfoundland and Labrador does not have any second-level administrative subdivision between the provincial government and its municipalities.

====Northwest Territories====
The Northwest Territories are divided into regions; however, these regions only serve to streamline the delivery of territorial governmental services, and have no government of their own.

====Nova Scotia====
Nova Scotia formerly had a two-tier system of local government in which counties were upper tier municipalities.

====Nunavut====
Nunavut is divided into regions; however, these regions only serve to streamline the delivery of territorial governmental services, and have no government of their own.

====Ontario====
Ontario has a two-tier system of local government in which counties are upper tier municipalities.

The primary administrative division of Southern Ontario is its 22 counties, which are upper-tier local governments providing limited municipal services to rural and moderately dense areas—within them, there are a variety of lower-tier towns, cities, villages, etc. that provide most municipal services. This contrasts with Northern Ontario&#x27;s 10 districts, which are geographic divisions but not local governments—although some towns, etc. are within them that are local governments, the low population densities and much larger area have significant impacts on how government is organized and operates. In both Northern and Southern Ontario, urban densities in cities are one of two other local structures: regional municipalities (restructured former counties which are also upper tiers) or single-tier municipalities.

====Prince Edward Island====
The counties of Prince Edward Island are historical and have no governments of their own today. However, they remain used as census divisions by Statistics Canada, and by locals as geographic identifiers.

====Quebec====
Quebec has a two-tier system of local government in which counties are upper tier municipalities. Quebec&#x27;s counties are more properly called &quot;Regional County Municipalities&quot; (). The province&#x27;s former counties proper were supplanted in the early 1980s.

====Saskatchewan====
Saskatchewan is divided into rural and urban municipalities, which do not overlap. Saskatchewan does not have any second-level administrative subdivision between the provincial government and the municipalities.

====Yukon====
Yukon does not have any second-level administrative subdivision between the territorial government and its municipalities.

===Jamaica===
Jamaica is divided into 14 parishes which are grouped together into 3 historic counties: Cornwall, Middlesex, and Surrey.

===United States===


Counties in U.S. states are administrative or political subdivisions of the state in which their boundaries are drawn. In addition, the United States Census Bureau uses the term &quot;county equivalent&quot; to describe places that are comparable to counties, but called by different names.

Forty-seven of the 50 U.S. states use the term &quot;county&quot;, while Alaska, Connecticut, and Louisiana use the terms &quot;borough&quot;, &quot;planning region&quot;, and &quot;parish&quot;, respectively, for analogous jurisdictions. A &quot;consolidated city-county&quot;, such as the City and County of San Francisco, is formed when a city and county merge into one unified jurisdiction. Conversely, &quot;independent cities&quot;, including Baltimore, St. Louis, Carson City, and all cities in Virginia, legally belong to no county, i.e. no county even nominally exists in those places compared to a consolidated city-county where a county does legally exist in some form. Washington, D.C., is known as a &quot;federal city&quot; because it is outside the jurisdiction of any state; the U.S. Census Bureau treats it as a single county equivalent.

The specific governmental powers of counties vary widely between the states. They are generally the intermediate tier of state government, between the statewide tier and the immediately local government tier (typically a city, town/borough, or village/township). Some of the governmental functions that a county may offer include judiciary, county prisons, land registration, enforcement of building codes, and federally mandated services programs. Depending on the individual state, counties or their equivalents may be administratively subdivided into townships, boroughs or boros, or towns (in the New England states, New York, and Wisconsin).

New York City is a special case where the city is made up of five boroughs, each of which is territorially coterminous with a county, though not always with an identical name. The Bronx is Bronx County, Brooklyn is Kings County, Manhattan is New York County, Queens is Queens County, and Staten Island is Richmond County. In the context of city government, the boroughs are subdivisions of the city but are still called &quot;county&quot; where county function is involved, e.g., &quot;&quot;New York County&quot; Courthouse&quot;.

County governments in Rhode Island and Connecticut have been completely abolished but the entities remain for administrative and statistical purposes in Rhode Island, while Connecticut has replaced them with planning regions served by councils of municipal governments. Alaska&#x27;s Unorganized Borough also has no county equivalent government, but the U.S. Census Bureau further divides it into statistical county equivalent subdivisions called census areas. Massachusetts eliminated county governments in 8 of its 14 counties.

Today, 3,142 counties and county equivalents carve up the United States, ranging in number from 3 for Delaware to 254 for Texas. The areas of each county also vary widely between the states. For example, the territorially medium-sized state of Pennsylvania has 67 counties delineated in geographically convenient ways. By way of contrast, Massachusetts, with far less territory, has massively sized counties in comparison even to Pennsylvania&#x27;s largest, yet each organizes their judicial and incarceration officials similarly.

Most counties have a county seat: a city, town, or other named place where its administrative functions are centered. Some New England states use the term shire town to mean &quot;county seat&quot;. A handful of counties like Harrison County, Mississippi have two or more county seats, usually located on opposite sides of the county, dating back from the days when travel was difficult. In Virginia, where all cities are independent, some double as county seats despite not being part of a county. Notable examples include the independent City of Fairfax serving as the seat of Fairfax County and Salem serving as the county seat of Roanoke County.

== Oceania ==
===Australia===
In the eastern states of Australia, counties are used in the administration of land titles. They do not generally correspond to a level of government, but are used in the identification of parcels of land.

The local communities in Australia that share the same post code are usually referred to as suburbs or localities. Several neighboring suburbs are often serviced by the same local government known as a council, whose jurisdiction is officially known as the local government area (LGA). An LGA functions basically the same way as a county of other countries, although it is called instead as &quot;city&quot;, &quot;municipality&quot;, &quot;shire&quot;, &quot;borough&quot;, &quot;town&quot;, &quot;district&quot; or simple &quot;councils&quot; depending on the state/territory and subregion. It performs municipal services and regulates permits for land uses, but lacks any legislative or law enforcement powers.

===New Zealand===
After New Zealand abolished its provinces in 1876, a system of counties similar to other countries&#x27; systems was instituted, lasting until 1989. They had chairmen, not mayors as boroughs and cities had; many legislative provisions (such as burial and land subdivision control) were different for the counties.

During the second half of the 20th century, many counties received overflow population from nearby cities. The result was often a merger of the two into a &quot;district&quot; (e.g. Rotorua) or a change of name to either &quot;district&quot; (e.g. Waimairi) or &quot;city&quot; (e.g. Manukau City).

The Local Government Act 1974 began the process of bringing urban, mixed, and rural councils into the same legislative framework. Substantial reorganisations under that Act resulted in the 1989 shake-up, which covered the country in (non-overlapping) cities and districts and abolished all the counties except for the Chatham Islands County, which survived under that name for a further 6 years but then became a &quot;Territory&quot; under the &quot;Chatham Islands Council&quot;.

== South America ==
===Argentina===
Provinces in Argentina are divided into departments (), except in the Buenos Aires Province, where they are called . The Autonomous City of Buenos Aires is divided into communes ().

===Brazil===
States in Brazil were divided into microregions () before they were replaced by &quot;immediate geographic regions&quot; in 2017.

<text>Year 1054 ([[Roman numerals|MLIV]]) was a common year starting on Saturday of the Julian calendar.

== Events ==
East-West schism: the ongoing break of communion between the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. &lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Byzantine Empire ====
* Sultan Tughril leads a large Seljuk army out of Azerbaijan into Armenia, possibly to consolidate his frontier, while providing an incentive to his Turkoman allies in the form of plunder. Tughril divides his army into four columns, ordering three to veer off to the north to raid into central and northern Armenia, while he takes the fourth column towards Lake Van. The Seljuk Turks capture and sack the fortress city of Artchesh, after an 8-day siege.

==== Europe ====
* Battle of Mortemer: The Normans, led by Duke William the Conqueror, defeat a French army (near Mortemer), as it is caught pillaging and plundering. King Henry I of France withdraws his main army from the Duchy of Normandy as a result. Guy I, Count of Ponthieu, is captured during the course of the battle.

==== Scotland ====
* July 27 – Siward, earl of Northumbria, invades Scotland, to support King Malcolm III against Macbeth, who has usurped the Scottish throne from Malcolm&#x27;s father, Duncan I. Macbeth is defeated at Dunsinane.

==== Africa ====
* The Almoravids retake the trading center of Aoudaghost from the Ghana Empire. Repeated Almoravid incursions, aimed at seizing control of the trans-Saharan gold trade, disrupt Ghana&#x27;s dominance of the trade routes.

==== Asia ====
* Lý Nhật Tôn, third king of the Lý Dynasty, begins to rule in Vietnam, and changes the country&#x27;s official name to Đại Việt.

=== By topic ===

==== Astronomy ====
* July 4 &quot;(approx.)&quot; – SN 1054, a supernova, is first observed by the Chinese, Arabs and possibly Native Americans, near the star Zeta Tauri. For 23 days it remains bright enough to be seen in daylight. Its remnants form the Crab Nebula (NGC 1952).

==== Religion ====
* Spring – Pope Leo IX sends a legatine mission, under Cardinal Humbert of Silva Candida, to Constantinople, to negotiate with Patriarch Michael I Cerularius, in response to his actions concerning the church in Constantinople. Leo becomes the first pope directly to invoke the forged Donation of Constantine, citing a large portion in a letter to Michael, believing it genuine.
* July 16 – East-West Schism: Humbert of Silva Candida, representative of the newly deceased Leo IX, breaks the relations between Western and Eastern Churches, through the act of placing an invalidly-issued Papal Bull of excommunication during the celebration of the Divine Liturgy.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* September 2 – Sukjong, ruler of Goryeo (d. 1105)
* Al-Hariri of Basra, Abbasid poet and scholar (d. 1122)
* Bohemond I of Antioch, Italo-Norman nobleman (approximate date)
* George II (Giorgi), king of Georgia (approximate date)
* Judith of Lens, niece of William the Conqueror (or 1055)
* Judith of Swabia, queen consort of Hungary (d. 1105)
* Langri Tangpa, Tibetan Buddhist master (d. 1123)
* Ramon Berenguer II, Count of Barcelona (or 1053)
* Tong Guan, Chinese general and adviser (d. 1126)

<text>In quantum mechanics, counterfactual definiteness (CFD) is the ability to speak &quot;meaningfully&quot; of the definiteness of the results of measurements that have not been performed (i.e., the ability to assume the existence of objects, and properties of objects, even when they have not been measured). The term &quot;counterfactual definiteness&quot; is used in discussions of physics calculations, especially those related to the phenomenon called quantum entanglement and those related to the Bell inequalities. In such discussions &quot;meaningfully&quot; means the ability to treat these unmeasured results on an equal footing with measured results in statistical calculations. It is this (sometimes assumed but unstated) aspect of counterfactual definiteness that is of direct relevance to physics and mathematical models of physical systems and not philosophical concerns regarding the meaning of unmeasured results.

==Overview==

The subject of counterfactual definiteness receives attention in the study of quantum mechanics because it is argued that, when challenged by the findings of quantum mechanics, classical physics must give up its claim to one of three assumptions: locality (no &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot;), no-conspiracy (called also &quot;asymmetry of time&quot;), or counterfactual definiteness (or &quot;non-contextuality&quot;).

If physics gives up the claim to locality, it brings into question our ordinary ideas about causality and suggests that events may transpire at faster-than-light speeds.

If physics gives up the &quot;no conspiracy&quot; condition, it becomes possible for &quot;nature to force experimenters to measure what she wants, and when she wants, hiding whatever she does not like physicists to see.&quot;

If physics rejects the possibility that, in all cases, there can be &quot;counterfactual definiteness,&quot; then it rejects some features that humans are very much accustomed to regarding as enduring features of the universe.
&quot;The elements of reality the EPR paper is talking about are nothing but what the property interpretation calls properties existing independently of the measurements. In each run of the experiment, there exist some elements of reality, the system has particular properties &lt; #ai &gt; which unambiguously determine the measurement outcome &lt; ai &gt;, given that the corresponding measurement a is performed.&quot;

As a noun, &quot;counterfactual&quot; may refer to an inferred effect or consequence of an unobserved macroscopic event. An example is counterfactual quantum computation.

==Theoretical considerations==
An interpretation of quantum mechanics can be said to involve the use of counterfactual definiteness if it includes in the mathematical modelling outcomes of measurements that are counterfactual; in particular, those that are excluded according to quantum mechanics by the fact that quantum mechanics does not contain a description of simultaneous measurement of conjugate pairs of properties.

For example, the uncertainty principle states that one cannot simultaneously know, with arbitrarily high precision, both the position and momentum of a particle. Suppose one measures the position of a particle. This act destroys any information about its momentum. Is it then possible to talk about the outcome that one would have obtained if one had measured its momentum instead of its position? In terms of mathematical formalism, is such a counterfactual momentum measurement to be included, together with the factual position measurement, in the statistical population of possible outcomes describing the particle? If the position were found to be r0 then in an interpretation that permits counterfactual definiteness, the statistical population describing position and momentum would contain all pairs (r0,p) for every possible momentum value p, whereas an interpretation that rejects counterfactual values completely would only have the pair (r0,⊥) where ⊥ (called &quot;up tack&quot; or &quot;eet&quot;) denotes an undefined value. To use a macroscopic analogy, an interpretation which rejects counterfactual definiteness views measuring the position as akin to asking where in a room a person is located, while measuring the momentum is akin to asking whether the person&#x27;s lap is empty or has something on it. If the person&#x27;s position has changed by making him or her stand rather than sit, then that person has no lap and neither the statement &quot;the person&#x27;s lap is empty&quot; nor &quot;there is something on the person&#x27;s lap&quot; is true. Any statistical calculation based on values where the person is standing at some place in the room and simultaneously has a lap as if sitting would be meaningless.

The dependability of counterfactually definite values is a basic assumption, which, together with &quot;time asymmetry&quot; and &quot;local causality&quot; led to the Bell inequalities. Bell showed that the results of experiments intended to test the idea of hidden variables would be predicted to fall within certain limits based on all three of these assumptions, which are considered principles fundamental to classical physics, but that the results found within those limits would be inconsistent with the predictions of quantum mechanical theory. Experiments have shown that quantum mechanical results predictably exceed those classical limits. Calculating expectations based on Bell&#x27;s work implies that for quantum physics the assumption of &quot;local realism&quot; must be abandoned. Bell&#x27;s theorem proves that every type of quantum theory must necessarily violate locality &quot;or&quot; reject the possibility of extending the mathematical description with outcomes of measurements which were not actually made.

Counterfactual definiteness is present in any interpretation of quantum mechanics that allows quantum mechanical measurement outcomes to be seen as deterministic functions of a system&#x27;s state or of the state of the combined system and measurement apparatus. Cramer&#x27;s (1986) transactional interpretation does not make that interpretation.

==Examples of interpretations rejecting counterfactual definiteness==
===Copenhagen interpretation===
The traditional Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics rejects counterfactual definiteness as it does not ascribe any value at all to a measurement that was not performed. When measurements are performed, values result, but these are not considered to be revelations of pre-existing values. In the words of Asher Peres, &quot;unperformed experiments have no results&quot;.

===Many worlds===
The many-worlds interpretation rejects counterfactual definiteness in a different sense; instead of not assigning a value to measurements that were not performed, it ascribes many values. When measurements are performed each of these values gets realized as the resulting value in a different world of a branching reality. As Prof. Guy Blaylock of the University of Massachusetts Amherst puts it, &quot;The many-worlds interpretation is not only counterfactually indefinite, it is factually indefinite as well.&quot;

===Consistent histories===
The consistent histories approach rejects counterfactual definiteness in yet another manner; it ascribes single but hidden values to unperformed measurements and disallows combining values of incompatible measurements (counterfactual or factual) as such combinations do not produce results that would match any obtained purely from performed compatible measurements. When a measurement is performed the hidden value is nevertheless realized as the resulting value. Robert Griffiths likens these to &quot;slips of paper&quot; placed in &quot;opaque envelopes&quot;. Thus Consistent Histories does not reject counterfactual results per se, it rejects them only when they are being combined with incompatible results. Whereas in the Copenhagen interpretation or the Many Worlds interpretation, the algebraic operations to derive Bell&#x27;s inequality cannot proceed due to having no value or many values where a single value is required, in Consistent Histories, they can be performed but the resulting correlation coefficients can not be equated with those that would be obtained by actual measurements (which are instead given by the rules of quantum mechanical formalism). The derivation combines incompatible results, only some of which could be factual for a given experiment and the rest counterfactual.

<doc id="36668" wikidata="Q508439" url="?curid=36668" title="Mick Fleetwood">
<text>Michael John Kells Fleetwood (born 24 June 1947) is a British musician, songwriter and actor. He is the drummer, co-founder, and leader of the rock band Fleetwood Mac. Fleetwood, whose surname was merged with that of the group&#x27;s bassist John &quot;Mac&quot; McVie (the only two members to appear on every studio album during the band&#x27;s run) to form the name of the band, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Fleetwood Mac in 1998. 

Born in Redruth, Cornwall, Fleetwood lived in Egypt and Norway for much of his childhood. Choosing to follow his musical interests, Fleetwood travelled to London at the age of 15, eventually forming the first incarnation of Fleetwood Mac with Peter Green, Jeremy Spencer and Bob Brunning. After several album releases and line-up changes, the group moved to the United States in 1974. Fleetwood then invited Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks to join. Buckingham and Nicks contributed to much of Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s later commercial success, including the celebrated album &quot;Rumours&quot;, while Fleetwood&#x27;s own determination to keep the band together was essential to the band&#x27;s longevity. 
Fleetwood has also enjoyed a solo career, published written works, and flirted briefly with acting.

==Early life==
Michael John Kells Fleetwood was born in Redruth, Cornwall, second child to John Joseph Kells Fleetwood and Bridget Maureen (née Brereton) Fleetwood. His elder sister was actress Susan Fleetwood. In early childhood, Fleetwood and his family followed his father, a Royal Air Force fighter pilot, to Egypt. Six years later, they moved to Norway where his father was deployed by NATO. He attended school there and became fluent in Norwegian.

Biographer Cath Carroll describes the young Fleetwood as &quot;a dreamer, an empathetic youth&quot; who, though intelligent, did not excel academically. According to his own autobiography, Fleetwood had an extremely difficult and trying time academically at the English boarding schools he attended, including King&#x27;s School at Sherborne House in Gloucestershire and Wynstones School in Gloucestershire. He performed poorly on exams, which he attributed to his inability to memorise facts. He nevertheless enjoyed acting during school, often in drag, and was a competent fencer. At tall, he was an imposing figure, and sported a beard and long hair for much of his life. &quot;Mick was very aristocratic,&quot; recalls Ken Caillat, a sound engineer on &quot;Rumours&quot;. &quot;The way he formed sentences was impeccable. When he spoke, everyone stopped and listened. He was quiet and wise, and he had a great sense of humour. He loved to laugh, but he was also a straight shooter.&quot;

Abandoning academic pursuits, Fleetwood took up the drums after his parents, recognising that he might find a future in music, bought him a &quot;Gigster&quot; drum kit when he was thirteen. His family encouraged his artistic side, as his father composed poetry and was an amateur drummer himself. Fleetwood was inspired—as he said at the Brits Awards ceremony in 1989—by Cliff Richard, Tony Meehan (drummer of the Shadows), and The Everly Brothers. With his parents&#x27; support, he dropped out of school at 15 and, in 1963, moved to London to pursue a career as a drummer. At first, he stayed with his younger sister Sally in Notting Hill. After a brief stint working at Liberty in London, he found his first opportunity in music.

==Career==

===Early efforts in London===
Keyboard player Peter Bardens lived only a few doors away from Fleetwood&#x27;s first home in London, and upon hearing of the proximity of an available drummer, Bardens gave Fleetwood his first gig in Bardens&#x27; band the Cheynes in July 1963, thus seeding the young drummer&#x27;s musical career. It would take him from the Cheynes—with whom he supported early gigs by the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds—to stints in the Bo Street Runners, where he replaced original drummer Nigel Hutchinson, who had enjoyed brief television fame on &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot;. However, by April 1965, when Fleetwood joined the band, it was fading into obscurity. By February 1966, Bardens, who had left the group, called on Fleetwood to join his new band, the Peter Bs, which soon expanded to become Shotgun Express (with Rod Stewart). Peter Green, who was a guitarist in the Peter Bs, left to join John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers, followed by Fleetwood in April 1967. Mayall’s new band already featured John McVie.

Green became a supportive bandmate who helped Fleetwood in his early experimentation with the drum kit. Fleetwood was, however, dismissed from the Bluesbreakers for repeated insobriety during gigs. Both Fleetwood and McVie were heavy drinkers, and their combined efforts were too much for Mayall and the band to cope with. Green, feeling trapped within the Bluesbreakers, also left in June 1967. Recalling &quot;his favourite rhythm section, &#x27;Fleetwood Mac&#x27;&quot;—Mick Fleetwood and John McVie—Green elected to invite both to join him in his new band, Fleetwood Mac. Though McVie hesitated briefly due to financial reasons, both joined Green by the summer of 1967 with a record contract on the horizon.

===Peter Green&#x27;s Fleetwood Mac===

The initial incarnation of Fleetwood Mac performed its first gig in August 1967 at the seventh annual Windsor Jazz and Blues Festival, playing a Chicago-style blues. McVie, initially hesitant to commit, was later prompted to leave the Bluesbreakers and join Fleetwood Mac full-time when the former adopted a horns section with which he disagreed. He replaced the initial bassist, Bob Brunning. McVie, Fleetwood, Green and guitarist Jeremy Spencer thus formed the first fixed line-up of Fleetwood Mac.

The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Peter Green&#x27;s Fleetwood Mac&quot;, was released in 1968, and the band toured the United States for the first time, though Green was reluctant to do so for fear of gun crime. Upon their return, they recorded a second album, &quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot; under simply &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; with Green&#x27;s name dropped. A guest musician on the album, Christine Perfect, became close with the group. She and McVie married in 1968. A third guitarist, Danny Kirwan, was also added to the line-up. Despite the success of their third album, &quot;Then Play On&quot;, and a string of hit singles including &quot;Albatross&quot; and &quot;Man of the World&quot;, Green himself drifted away from the band, struggling both creatively and with increasing use of LSD.

===1970–1973===
Fleetwood remained a consistent presence in the ever-changing line-up of the group following the departure of Green in May 1970, when Spencer and Kirwan assumed more central roles in the group&#x27;s song-writing. In September 1970 the release of &quot;Kiln House&quot; saw a line-up of Spencer, Kirwan, John McVie and Fleetwood, with Christine McVie providing keyboards and backing vocals. Fleetwood, &quot;a social creature who prized community and communication&quot;, was particularly taken with the group&#x27;s new living arrangements: they moved into a large Victoria-era mansion near Headley, Hampshire.

By early 1971, with Christine McVie becoming an official member of the band, Fleetwood and the group boarded a plane to San Francisco. Spencer, fearful following the recent 1971 San Fernando earthquake, reluctantly boarded the plane. He left the hotel abruptly one afternoon and disappeared. He was found several days later to have joined Family International, then known as Children of God, a religious group. Once more, Fleetwood attempted to mediate; however, Spencer would not return. Bob Welch would become their next member. Their next album, &quot;Future Games&quot;, was released later that year. &quot;Bare Trees&quot; came a year later, in 1972. During the subsequent tours to promote the latter, Fleetwood once more adopted the role of mediator. Kirwan&#x27;s self-destructive personality and problems with alcohol culminated in a refusal to go on stage before one concert; Fleetwood himself made the decision to fire the band member. Furthermore, there were early signs of strife in the marriage of John and Christine McVie. Fleetwood again stepped in to mediate between the two members, talking Christine out of a decision to leave the group. The band added guitarist Bob Weston and vocalist Dave Walker, formerly of Savoy Brown and the Idle Race. The resulting turmoil, however, negatively affected their next album, &quot;Penguin&quot;, released in 1973 to poor reviews. Walker was subsequently asked to leave the group, and the next album &quot;Mystery to Me&quot; was received more warmly.

In October 1973, Fleetwood instructed Weston—who had engaged in an affair with Fleetwood&#x27;s wife—to leave Fleetwood Mac. Meanwhile, manager Clifford Davis began to lead a separate group of musicians under the name &#x27;Fleetwood Mac&#x27;, and his increasing legal assault on the original group pushed Fleetwood and his fellow band members to consider managing themselves. Fleetwood took on more managerial responsibility and leadership over the group.

===&quot;Heroes Are Hard to Find&quot;, &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot;, &quot;Rumours&quot;===

In 1974, the band moved to Los Angeles, where they recorded the album &quot;Heroes Are Hard to Find&quot;. By November 1974, Bob Welch had left the band. Meanwhile, Fleetwood was planning a follow-up album to &quot;Heroes Are Hard to Find&quot; – Welch&#x27;s last with the group – which had charted at #34 in the US. Fleetwood was shopping with his children when a chance encounter with an old friend led him to visit Sound City and producer Keith Olsen. While at the studio, Olsen played samples from an album entitled &quot;Buckingham Nicks&quot;. Fleetwood immediately &quot;was in awe&quot;. On New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1974, Fleetwood contacted Olsen to advise him that their planned project was on hiatus after Welch&#x27;s departure, however, he then suggested that Nicks and Buckingham join Fleetwood Mac. The group ate together with Nicks and Fleetwood at a local restaurant before practising together for the first time in the new studio.

The next year, the new line-up released &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot;. The album proved to be a breakthrough for the band and became a huge hit, reaching No.1 in the US and selling over five million copies. Fleetwood and Olsen collaborated on a number of drumming innovations. &quot;It was all about &#x27;plastic puke.&#x27; First off, for the kick drum I had Mick use a real skin, not a plastic head. All the bass drum sounds had snap and rack and warmth, but the snare drum on the whole album was a plastic puke.&quot; The album had reached No. 1 come November 1976, and at this time Fleetwood Mac became self-managing, with Fleetwood himself arguing that an external manager would be less apt at holding together such a group of dynamic personalities. He put forward an idea of promising to reimburse any losses suffered by promoters should they occur, in an attempt to raise the group&#x27;s profile and earn more contracts and gigs. &quot;Self-management was the right decision,&quot; remembered freelance &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer John Grissim. &quot;Mick Fleetwood had great leadership skills ... had a great deal of experience—nine years. They were business-like, they always delivered the product and had the right lawyers and accountants for the job. They didn&#x27;t need what Van Morrison called &#x27;pressure mongers,&#x27;... they just needed to get on and make a really good album.&quot; Ken Caillat, sound engineer on &quot;Rumours&quot;, concurred that Fleetwood &quot;had superb intuition and a flair for taking risks&quot;.
Like many musicians during the 1970s in Los Angeles, Fleetwood Mac began using copious amounts of cocaine. Fleetwood would go on to recollect in his autobiography that &quot;Until then, Fleetwood Mac hadn&#x27;t had much experience with this Andean rocket fuel. Now we discovered that a toot now and then relieved the boredom of long hours in the studio with little nourishment.&quot; The personal relationships between the band members were becoming frayed. After six months of non-stop touring, the McVies divorced in August 1976, ending nearly eight years of marriage. The couple stopped talking to each other socially and discussed only musical matters. Buckingham and Nicks also fought often, a fact that was revealed to fans by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in April 1976. The duo&#x27;s arguments stopped only when they worked on songs together. At the same time, Christine McVie and Nicks became closer. Fleetwood, meanwhile, began searching for a new recording location, and landed on the Record Plant of Sausalito, California. Grissim, working for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, frequently met with the group and took a particular liking to Fleetwood, whom he described as &quot;a real pro.&quot;

Fleetwood Mac convened at the Record Plant February 1976 with hired engineers Ken Caillat and Richard Dashut. Most band members complained about the studio and wanted to record at their homes, but Fleetwood did not allow any moves. Despite his talent at keeping the group together, the recording of &quot;Rumours&quot; was fraught with emotional turmoil due to the collapsing relationships within the line-up. Christine McVie and Nicks decided to live in two condominiums near the city&#x27;s harbour, while the male contingent stayed at the studio&#x27;s lodge in the adjacent hills. Chris Stone, one of the Record Plant&#x27;s owners, recalled that &quot;The band would come in at 7 at night, have a big feast, party till 1 or 2 in the morning, and then when they were so whacked-out they couldn&#x27;t do anything, they&#x27;d start recording&quot;. Fleetwood often played his drum kit outside the studio&#x27;s partition screen to better gauge Caillat&#x27;s and Dashut&#x27;s reactions to the music&#x27;s groove. After the final mastering stage and hearing the songs back-to-back, the band members sensed they had recorded something &quot;pretty powerful&quot;.

&quot;Rumours&quot; was a huge commercial success and became Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s second US number one record. It stayed at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for 31 non-consecutive weeks, while also reaching number one in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. The album was certified platinum in America and the UK within months of release after one million units and 300,000 units were shipped respectively. The band and co-producers Caillat and Dashut, would go on to win the 1978 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. By March, the album had sold over 10 million copies worldwide, including over eight million in the US alone.

===&quot;Tusk&quot;, experimentation===
&quot;Tusk&quot;, Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s 12th studio album, was released in 1979. The work represented a more experimental direction taken by Buckingham. Fleetwood, recently diagnosed as having diabetes after suffering recurring bouts of hypoglycaemia during several live shows, was again instrumental in maintaining the band&#x27;s cohesion. He placated Buckingham over feelings of creative claustrophobia and discomfort playing alongside Nicks. On the issue of Buckingham taking creative control away from the other members of the group for the creation of &quot;Tusk&quot;, Fleetwood recounts that his three-day discussion with Buckingham culminated in him telling the latter that &quot;if it&#x27;s good, then go ahead.&quot; Though the nature of the album strained relationships again within the band—particularly John McVie, a long-established blues musician who disliked the experimental nature of the album—Fleetwood himself rates the album as his favourite by Fleetwood Mac, and cites the freedom of creative expression allotted to each band member as integral to the survival of the group. The album sold four million copies worldwide, a return noticeably poorer than &quot;Rumours&quot;. Though Buckingham was blamed by the record labels, Fleetwood linked the album&#x27;s relative failure to the RKO radio chain playing the album in its entirety prior to release, thus allowing mass home taping.

===Later career===

Fleetwood has also led a number of side projects. 1981&#x27;s &quot;The Visitor&quot; produced by Richard Dashut, featured heavy African stylistics and a rerecording of &quot;Rattlesnake Shake&quot; with Peter Green.

In 1983, Fleetwood formed Mick Fleetwood&#x27;s Zoo and recorded &quot;I&#x27;m Not Me&quot;. The album featured a minor hit, &quot;I Want You Back&quot;, and a cover version of the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Angel Come Home&quot;. A later version of the group featured Bekka Bramlett on vocals and recorded 1991&#x27;s &quot;Shaking the Cage&quot;. Fleetwood released &quot;Something Big&quot; in 2004 with the Mick Fleetwood Band, and his most recent album is &quot;Blue Again!&quot;, appearing in October 2008 with the Mick Fleetwood Blues Band touring to support it, interspersed with the &quot;Unleashed&quot; tour of Fleetwood Mac.

Fleetwood has played drums on many of his bandmates&#x27; solo records, including &quot;Law and Order&quot;, where he played on the album&#x27;s biggest hit, &quot;Trouble&quot;. Other albums include &quot;French Kiss&quot;, &quot;Three Hearts&quot;, &quot;The Wild Heart&quot;, &quot;Christine McVie&quot;, &quot;Try Me&quot;, &quot;Under the Skin&quot;, &quot;Gift of Screws&quot;, and &quot;In Your Dreams&quot;. In 2007 he was featured on drums for the song &quot;God&quot; along with Jack&#x27;s Mannequin in the Pop album &quot;Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur&quot;, a collection of covers of John Lennon songs.

Fleetwood co-authored &quot;Fleetwood—My Life and Adventures with Fleetwood Mac&quot; with writer Stephen Davis. The book was published in 1990. In the book, he discussed his experiences with other musicians including Eric Clapton, members of the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, as well as the affair with Stevie Nicks and his addiction to cocaine and his personal bankruptcy. Reception was mixed. Robert Waddell of the &quot;New York Times&quot; described the piece as &quot;a blithe, slapdash memoir.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″s Steve Hochman noted that &quot;Fleetwood tells the story as if he was sitting in your living room, which is good for the intimacy of the tale, but bad for the rambling, sometimes redundant telling.&quot; Hochman did acknowledge that Fleetwood was &quot;one of rock&#x27;s more colorful characters.&quot;

Fleetwood has a secondary career as a TV and film actor, usually in minor parts. His roles in this field have included a leader of the Resistance in &quot;The Running Man&quot; (1987), and as a guest alien in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Manhunt&quot; (1989).

Fleetwood co-hosted the 1989 BRIT Awards, which contained numerous gaffes and flubbed lines. In the wake of this public mishap, the BRIT Awards were pre-recorded for the next 18 years until 2007; the awards are now again broadcast live to the British public.

In 1998, Fleetwood was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Fleetwood Mac.

As of March 2021, Fleetwood had been a member of Fleetwood Mac for 53 years and was the only band member who had been in the band for its entire history.

==Playing style==

Fleetwood was a self-taught drummer from his early childhood, after moving from a lacklustre academic performance at school to a love of music encouraged by his family, who bought him his first drum kit. His first years were heavily influenced by Tony Meehan and The Everly Brothers, and during his formative years in London during the late 1960s, Green helped Fleetwood through bouts of &quot;rhythmic dyslexia&quot; during live performances when Fleetwood panicked and lost the beat. He often sang filled pauses along to songs to help keep the beat. Green also instilled in Fleetwood an ability to follow and predict the lead guitarist, enabling him to meet the guitar with the drum rhythm as well as allowing him to know a good guitarist when he saw one—which would in part lead him later in his career to select Lindsey Buckingham.
Bob Brunning recalled from his early involvement with Fleetwood Mac that Fleetwood was &quot;very open to playing with different people as long as he didn&#x27;t have to change his style. He was, and is, a completely straightforward drummer, and it works with a lot of different styles. I don&#x27;t s&#x27;pose [sic] he&#x27;s played a traditional drum solo in his life!&quot; Biographer Carroll highlights this ability as integral to the success of Fleetwood Mac, arguing that Fleetwood was not a virtuoso, but his disciplined and in-distractable manner of play allowed him to hold together a band of strong leading personalities without impinging upon their expression.

Caillat, in contrast, cites Fleetwood as &quot;still one of the most amazing drummers I&#x27;ve ever met. He had his rack of tom drums arranged back to front. Most drummers place them from high to low (in pitch) from their left to right, but Mick chose to place his mid, high, low. I think perhaps this helped him develop his unique style. He hit his drums very hard, except for his kick drum. For some reason, when he played his high hat, it distracted him. He would keep perfect beat with his kick, but he played it so softly that we could hear his mouth noises through his kick mic.&quot;

==Personal life==
Fleetwood has been married to three women and has four children.

In the 1960s, Fleetwood became infatuated with model Jenny Boyd, the younger sister of Pattie Boyd. In June 1970, Fleetwood and Jenny Boyd were married. 
In the mid-1970s, Fleetwood discovered that Boyd was having an affair with band member Weston. Fleetwood, after wrestling with the idea of leaving the band, was later critical of his own role in &quot;neglecting&quot; his family. Fleetwood and Boyd divorced in 1976. Fleetwood travelled to Zambia to convalesce, with Christine McVie—who was also suffering marital problems—travelling with him for part of the journey.

Boyd and Fleetwood began living together once more in 1976, and temporarily remarried to help their children emigrate from the UK to the US. In November 1977, Fleetwood and Nicks began having an affair. The affair continued sporadically for the next two years until the pair mutually decided to end it. Fleetwood and Boyd&#x27;s second marriage also ended in divorce. They had two daughters together.

In November 1978, Fleetwood moved into a Bel-Air home with Sara Recor, a mutual friend of Fleetwood and Nicks who was at the time married to another music producer. Fleetwood married Recor in 1988; the couple divorced in 1995.

Fleetwood married Lynn Frankel in 1995. Fleetwood and Frankel had twin daughters who were born in 2002. The couple divorced in 2015.

Fleetwood was a heavy cocaine user in the 1970s.

Fleetwood became a U.S. citizen on 22 November 2006 in Los Angeles.

Fleetwood has lived in Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii for years. His restaurant and bar called Fleetwood&#x27;s were lost to the 2023 Hawaii wildfires.

==Equipment==

When he was 15, Fleetwood&#x27;s parents bought him a Rogers drum kit, which helped him land his first gig as a drummer. During his tenure in Fleetwood Mac, he primarily used Ludwig Drums for live performances and Sonor Drums in the studio. He specifically sought Ludwig drums for their oversized bass drums and tom-toms. By the Tusk tour, Fleetwood dropped both drum kits from his arsenal in favour of Tama Drums. He attributed his pivot to Tama to Ludwig&#x27;s supposed deterioration in quality and Sonor&#x27;s inability to produce a bass drum suitable for Fleetwood&#x27;s large frame. From the 1990s onwards, Fleetwood has been an endorser of Drum Workshop. His drum kit for the Say You Will Tour was made from wood dredged from the bottom of the Great Lakes. All of his drum shells and hardware are coated in 18 carat gold.

Fleetwood had played Paiste cymbals from the late 60s to early 90s, favouring their expressiveness and higher frequencies over Zildjian cymbals. He stopped using Paiste cymbals by 1994 and subsequently switched over to Zildjian.

He also uses Remo drumheads, Easton Ahead 5B Light Rock drumsticks and Latin Percussion. Fleetwood has incorporated many percussion instruments into his drum rig, including a 40 inch Zildjian gong, two rows of wind chimes, and congas.

<doc id="36670" wikidata="Q138865" url="?curid=36670" title="Soma cube">
<text>The Soma cube is a solid dissection puzzle invented by Danish polymath Piet Hein in 1933 during a lecture on quantum mechanics conducted by Werner Heisenberg.

Seven different pieces made out of unit cubes must be assembled into a 3×3×3 cube. The pieces can also be used to make a variety of other 3D shapes.

The pieces of the Soma cube consist of all possible combinations of at most four unit cubes, joined at their faces, such that at least one inside corner is formed. There are no combinations of one or two cubes that satisfy this condition, but one combination of three cubes and six combinations of four cubes that do. Thus, 3 + (6 × 4) is 27, which is exactly the number of cells in a 3×3×3 cube. Of these seven combinations, two are mirror images of each other (see Chirality).

The Soma cube was popularized by Martin Gardner in the September 1958 Mathematical Games column in &quot;Scientific American.&quot; The book &quot;Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays&quot; also contains a detailed analysis of the Soma cube problem.

There are 240 distinct solutions of the Soma cube puzzle, excluding rotations and reflections: these are easily generated by a simple recursive backtracking search computer program similar to that used for the eight queens puzzle. John Horton Conway and Michael Guy first identified all 240 possible solutions by hand in 1961. 

==Pieces==
The seven Soma pieces are six polycubes of order four, and one of order three:

==Production==
Piet Hein authorized a finely crafted rosewood version of the Soma cube manufactured by Theodor Skjøde Knudsen&#x27;s company Skjøde Skjern (of Denmark). Beginning in about 1967, it was marketed in the U.S. for several years by the game manufacturer Parker Brothers. Plastic Soma cube sets were also commercially produced by Parker Brothers in several colors (blue, red, and orange) during the 1970s. The package for the Parker Brothers version claimed there were 1,105,920 possible solutions. This figure includes rotations and reflections of each solution as well as rotations of the individual pieces. The puzzle is currently sold as a logic game by Piet Hein Trading and by ThinkFun (formerly Binary Arts) under the name Block by Block.

==Solutions==

Solving the Soma cube has been used as a task to measure individuals&#x27; performance and effort in a series of psychology experiments. In these experiments, test subjects are asked to solve a soma cube as many times as possible within a set period of time. For example, In 1969, Edward Deci, a Carnegie Mellon University graduate assistant at the time, asked his research subjects to solve a soma cube under conditions with varying incentives in his dissertation work on intrinsic and extrinsic motivation establishing the social psychological theory of crowding out.

In each of the 240 distinct solutions to the cube puzzle, there is only one place that the &quot;T&quot; piece can be placed. Each solved cube can be rotated such that the &quot;T&quot; piece is on the bottom with its long edge along the front and the &quot;tongue&quot; of the &quot;T&quot; in the bottom center cube (this is the normalized position of the large cube). This can be proven as follows: If you consider all the possible ways that the &quot;T&quot; piece can be placed in the large cube (without regard to any of the other pieces), it will be seen that it will always fill either two corners of the large cube or zero corners. There is no way to orient the &quot;T&quot; piece such that it fills only one corner of the large cube. The &quot;L&quot; piece can be oriented such that it fills two corners, or one corner, or zero corners. Each of the other five pieces have no orientation that fills two corners; they can fill either one corner or zero corners. Therefore, if you exclude the &quot;T&quot; piece, the maximum number of corners that can be filled by the remaining six pieces is seven (one corner each for five pieces, plus two corners for the &quot;L&quot; piece). A cube has eight corners. But the &quot;T&quot; piece cannot be oriented to fill just that one remaining corner, and orienting it such that it fills zero corners will obviously not make a cube. Therefore, the &quot;T&quot; must always fill two corners, and there is only one orientation (discounting rotations and reflections) in which it does that. It also follows from this that in all solutions, five of the remaining six pieces will fill their maximum number of corners and one piece will fill one fewer than its maximum (this is called the deficient piece).

==Figures==

In addition to constructing a cube, the Soma manual provides assorted figures to construct with the seven pieces. The figure on the right shows solutions to some of the figures in the same colour scheme.

==Similar puzzles==
Similar to Soma cube is the 3D pentomino puzzle, which can fill boxes of 2×3×10, 2×5×6 and 3×4×5 units.

The Bedlam cube is a 4×4×4 sided cube puzzle consisting of twelve pentacubes and one tetracube. The Diabolical cube is a puzzle of six polycubes that can be assembled together to form a single 3×3×3 cube.

Eye Level also makes use of the Thinking Cube (once students are in levels 30-32 of Basic Thinking Math or levels 29-32 of Critical Thinking Math), as one of its Teaching Tools, similar to the Soma cube.

Rubik&#x27;s Bricks, a puzzle produced under the Rubik&#x27;s branding, is a similar puzzle made of 27 cubes, but the pieces are formed by joining cubes either by faces or by edges. There are exactly 9 such ways to join three cubes, so the puzzle can make a 3x3x3 cube. The individual cubes are colored in such a way as to give a unique solution.

<doc id="36673" wikidata="Q1549801" url="?curid=36673" title="Lhotshampa">
<text>The Lhotshampa or Lhotsampa (; ) people are a heterogeneous Bhutanese people of Nepali descent. The Lhotshampa were estimated to comprise around 35% of the Bhutan&#x27;s population by the U.S. Department of State as of 2008. The Lhotshampa are predominantly Hindu and Buddhist too, who speak the Nepali language.

People of Nepali origin started to settle in uninhabited areas of southern Bhutan in the 19th century. The term &quot;Lhotshampa&quot;, which means &quot;southern borderlanders&quot; in Dzongkha, began to be used by the Bhutanese state in the second half of the twentieth century to refer to the population of Nepali origin in the south of the country. By the 1990s, over 100,000 Lhotshampa had been forcibly displaced and removed from Bhutan.

After being displaced as a result of the state-run ethnic cleansing and living in refugee camps in eastern parts of Nepal, starting in 2007 most of the Bhutanese refugees were resettled to various countries, such as the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and other European countries. , the number of Lhotshampa in Nepal is significantly lower than that in the United States and other countries where they have resettled.

== History ==

=== Early immigration ===
The first small groups of Nepali emigrated primarily from eastern Nepal under British auspices in the late sixteenth and early seventieth centuries. The beginning of Nepali immigration largely coincided with Bhutan&#x27;s political development: in 1885, Druk Gyalpo Ugyen Wangchuck consolidated power after a period of civil unrest and cultivated closer ties with the British in India. 

In 1910, the government of Bhutan signed a treaty with the British in India, granting them control over Bhutan&#x27;s foreign relations. The actual immigrants registered and settled through the agent from Kalimpong, Raja Ugen Dorji and (son) Raja Sonam Togbay Dorji started in the reigns of the second and third kings. Immigrants from Nepal and India continued to enter Bhutan with an increase from the 1960s when Bhutan&#x27;s first modern five-year plan began, many arriving as construction workers.

=== 1960s-present ===
The government traditionally attempted to limit immigration and restrict residence and employment of Nepali to the southern region. Liberalization measures in the 1970s and 1980s encouraged intermarriage and provided increasing opportunities for public service. The government allowed more internal migration by Nepali seeking better education and business opportunities. 

In the 1980s and 1990s, the most divisive issue in Bhutan in the 1980s and early 1990s was the accommodation of the Nepali Hindu minority. In 1988, the government census recategorized people with Nepali heritage as illegal immigrants. Local Lhotshampa leaders responded with antigovernmental protests demanding citizenship and damaged government institutions.

In 1989, the Bhutanese government enacted reforms that directly impacted the Lhotshampa. First, it elevated the status of the national dress code of the Driglam namzha from recommended to mandatory. All citizens including the Lhotshampa were required to observe the dress code in public during business hours. This decree was resented by the Lhotshampa who complained about being forced to wear the clothing of the Ngalong majority. Second, the government removed Nepali as a language of instruction in schools in favor of Dzongkha, the national language. This alienated the Lhotshampa, many of whom knew no Dzongkha at all.

=== Expulsion ===
Since the late 1980s, over 100,000 Lhotshampa have been forced out of Bhutan, accused by the government of being illegal aliens. Between 1988 and 1993, thousands of others left, alleging ethnic and political repression. 

In a 1992 interview with the Calcutta Statesman, Bhutanese foreign minister Dawa Tsering stated that an increase in the country&#x27;s Nepali population would lead the country to become &quot;another Sikkim and Darjeeling&quot;. 

In 1990, violent ethnic unrest and anti-government protests in southern Bhutan pressed for greater democracy and respect for minority rights. That year, the Bhutan Peoples&#x27; Party, whose members are mostly Lhotshampa, began a campaign of violence against the Bhutanese government. In the wake of this unrest, thousands fled Bhutan. Bill Frelick of Human Rights Watch reported that state security forces forcibly removed ethnic Lhotshampa from their homes and coerced them into renouncing their citizenship. A refugee accounted that:&quot;The army took all the people from their houses... As we left Bhutan, we were forced to sign the document. They snapped our photos. The man told me to smile, to show my teeth. He wanted to show that I was leaving my country willingly, happily, that I was not forced to leave&quot;Many of them have either entered Nepal&#x27;s seven refugee camps (on 20 January 2010, 85,544 refugees resided in the camps) or are working in India. According to U.S. State Department estimates in 2008, about 35% of the population of Bhutan is Lhotshampa.

== Culture ==
Traditionally, the Lhotshampa have been involved mostly in sedentary agriculture, although some have cleared forest cover and conducted &quot;tsheri&quot; and slash and burn agriculture. The Lhotshampa are generally classified as Hindus. However, this is an oversimplification as many groups that include Tamang and the Gurung are largely Buddhist; the Kiranti groups that include the Rai and Limbu are largely animist followers of Mundhum (these latter groups are mainly found in eastern Bhutan). Whether they are Hindu or Tibetan Buddhist, most of them abstain from beef, notably those belonging to the orthodox classes who are vegetarians. Their main festivals include Dashain and Tihar.

== Language ==

Lhotshampas speak Nepali as their first language. Samchi, Chirang and Geylegphug are southern dzongkhags that have a large Lhotshampa community where most people speak Nepali. In southern Bhutan, Nepali used to be taught in the school and was spoken and written in these areas. However, this changed during the 1980s when there was racial conflict between Nepali in Bhutan and Bhutanese. Since then, Nepali is only taught in the home and has become a spoken language in Bhutan. Thus, some Nepali speakers from southern Bhutan cannot read or write in Nepali. Currently, Nepali is the first language for most southern Bhutanese and most people use it in their home. Also, Nepali is most commonly used in school outside of the classes.

Nepali in Bhutan is different in the rural areas and Thimphu. Also, some Nepali words are used differently in Bhutan than Nepali in Nepal.

<text>Glycerius (died after 474) was Roman emperor of the West from 473 to 474. He served as (commander of the palace guard) during the reign of Olybrius (), until Olybrius died in November 472. After a four-month interregnum, Glycerius was proclaimed as emperor in March 473 by Gundobad, the (master of soldiers) and power behind the throne. Very few of the events of his reign are known other than that an attempted invasion of Italy by the Visigoths was repelled by local commanders, diverting them to Gaul. Glycerius also prevented an invasion by the Ostrogoths through diplomacy, including a gift of 2,000 .

Glycerius was not recognized by the Eastern Roman emperor Leo I (), who instead nominated Julius Nepos () as Western Emperor and sent him with an army to invade the Western Empire. Glycerius was without allies because Gundobad had abandoned him, and therefore was forced to abdicate on 24 June 474, and was succeeded by Nepos. He was appointed Bishop of Salona, which position he held until his death. He died, possibly in 480, and a nearly contemporaneous source blames him for the assassination of Nepos, but the records for this event are muddled.

==Life==
===Background===
The historian Penny MacGeorge states the summary that &quot;almost nothing is known of Glycerius&quot;. Glycerius was born in Dalmatia. His family is unknown, and may not have been aristocratic. He rose to the office of (commander of the palace guard), and likely served as such during the reign of Western Roman Emperor Olybrius (). The Germanic (master of soldiers) Ricimer had deposed the Western Roman Emperor Majorian () in 461, and thereafter installed a series of Western Roman emperors as puppets: Libius Severus (), Anthemius (), and Olybrius, enthroned in July 472, after Ricimer overthrew Anthemius. Ricimer died on 18 August 472, forty days after deposing Anthemius, and was succeeded as and kingmaker by his Burgundian nephew Gundobad. Olybrius died shortly thereafter, on 2 November 472, and an interregnum ensued for nearly four months, before Gundobad convinced Glycerius to assume the throne, and proclaimed him as emperor at Ravenna: the , a record of consular years, states that it was on 5 March 473, however, the , also a consular record, asserts it was on the 3rd.

===Reign===
Few events of Glycerius&#x27; reign are known. Glycerius is known from a few fragmented references in what historian Ralph Mathisen calls &quot;jejune chronicles&quot;, such as the &quot;Annales&quot; of Marcellinus Comes, the &quot;Gallic Chronicle of 511&quot;, and the &quot;Chronicle of Saragossa&quot;, as well as some small references provided by the 6th-century writer Jordanes and the bishop Ennodius. Under Glycerius, invasions by both the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths were repelled, through a mixture of diplomatic and military activities. The Visigoths and Ostrogoths were Germanic groups that were settled in Gallia Aquitania, and Pannonia Prima and Valeria, respectively, as . In 473, the Visigothic king Euric () ordered an invasion of Italy, but his commander, Vincentius, was killed by the (regional commanders) Alla and Sindila. After Vincentius was killed, Euric chose instead to invade Gaul, occupying both Arles and Marseille. The Ostrogothic king Videmir () proposed to invade Italy, but Glycerius was able to dissuade Videmir through the gift of 2,000 (high-value gold coins), and diverted them from Italy to Gaul, where surrounding groups, described by Jordanes as &quot;various peoples&quot;, later attacked them. Mathisen comments that these actions to defend the empire may be the reason that Glycerius receives a generally favorable reception in Roman and Byzantine sources. The 9th-century historian Theophanes describes him only as a &quot;not despicable man&quot;, but Ennodius, the bishop of Pavia, describes him more thoroughly in his :

Mathisten states that the aforementioned injuries to Glycerius&#x27; mother may have been in reaction to his bribery of Videmir, but remarks that &quot;such measures were a regular part of imperial policy&quot;, and speculates that the attackers may have been soldiers, explaining their lack of punishment. Glycerius seems to have primarily reigned in northern Italy, as all the coins found from his reign but one were minted in either Ravenna or Milan. The only law enacted by Glycerius which has survived was dated 11 March 473, and issued to Himilco, the Praetorian prefect of Italy, and later reissued to the Praetorian prefects of Illyricum, the East, and Gaul, regarding simony (the selling of church offices). It was adopted not just by the prefects of Italy and Gaul, who were a part of the Western Roman Empire, but also by the prefects of Illyricum and the East, despite the fact that he did not have the authority to issue laws to them. The law was designed to grant Glycerius the support of the clergy, but would likely also have appealed to the senatorial class, who were concerned about increasingly violent elections, as well as the use of church funds by clergy for personal reasons. This law was also the last known one issued by a Western Roman emperor.

It is possible that Glycerius attempted reconciliation with the Eastern Roman Empire, evidenced by the fact that Glycerius did not nominate a consul for 474, and instead accepted the eastern consul, the infant Emperor Leo II (). Despite this, the Eastern Roman Emperor, Leo I (), refused to recognize Glycerius as emperor because he was merely a puppet of Gundobad. Emperor Leo instead chose to recognize one of his own men, Julius Nepos (), and sent him with a fleet to invade the Western Empire. The 7th-century historian John of Antioch states that Leo made the decision to remove Glycerius after hearing that he had assumed the throne of the Western Roman Empire, but Mathisen comments that Leo must have hesitated for some time, as the actual invasion was delayed by the onset of winter, and Julius Nepos was forced to wait until the beginning of spring to launch his invasion.

Glycerius was without allies, as Gundobad seemingly abandoned him, leaving him with no option but to surrender. After Nepos landed at Ostia in June 474, Glycerius abdicated on 24 June 474, in Ravenna, and Nepos assumed the throne. The historian John Michael O&#x27;Flynn states that the &quot;circumstances surrounding this speedy overthrow are obscure and, at first sight, puzzling&quot;, noting that while the forces of Nepos were likely small, Gundobad made no moves to counter them, but rather &quot;disappeared entirely from the Italian scene.&quot; He speculates that, while Gundobad could have put up stiff resistance, rather than attempting to oppose the imperial legitimacy of Leo, he accepted Leo&#x27;s authority to reject Glycerius as an imperial colleague and to install one of his own choosing. Additionally, Glycerius seems to never have attracted the favor of the Roman Senate or the Gallo-Roman aristocracy, which would make the decision to back him, and therefore alienate both, far less palatable for Gundobad. Notably, as king of Burgundy, Gundobad () enjoyed warm relations with the Eastern Roman Empire, which he served as a (treaty subject). Mathisen suggests the alternatives that Gundobad was attempting to raise further troops in Gaul, or that he left to ensure he received his inheritance after the death of his father, King Gondioc ().

===Later life===
After being deposed, Glycerius was promptly ordained as Bishop of Salona. According to the 5th-century Byzantine historian Malchus, Glycerius had some part in organizing the assassination of Julius Nepos in 480, after Nepos had been forced to flee Italy and was ruling in exile in Dalmatia, although the historical records for the assassination are muddled. Glycerius died sometime after 474, possibly in 480. He has sometimes been identified with a Glycerius who was Archbishop of Milan by King Odoacer (), but this is likely incorrect. The source for the promotion of Glycerius to archbishop is an obscure line written by Ennodius, in which he praises an archbishop named Glycerius, among other archbishops of Milan, however, this section seems to have been either corrupted or added later, to identify the archbishop Glycerius with the emperor Glycerius.

<text>Milan Kundera ( ; ; 1 April 1929 – 11 July 2023) was a Czech and French novelist. Kundera went into exile in France in 1975, acquiring citizenship in 1981. His Czechoslovak citizenship was revoked in 1979, but he was granted Czech citizenship in 2019.

Kundera&#x27;s best-known work is &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot;. Before the Velvet Revolution of 1989, the country&#x27;s ruling Communist Party of Czechoslovakia banned his books. He led a low-profile life and rarely spoke to the media. He was thought to be a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature and was also a nominee for other awards.

Kundera was awarded the Jerusalem Prize in 1985, the Austrian State Prize for European Literature in 1987, and the Herder Prize in 2000. In 2021, he received the Golden Order of Merit from the president of Slovenia, Borut Pahor.

==Early life and education==
Milan Kundera was born on 1 April 1929 at Purkyňova 6 (6 Purkyně Street) in Královo Pole, a district of Brno, Czechoslovakia (present-day Czech Republic), to a middle-class family. His father, Ludvík Kundera (1891–1971), was an important Czech musicologist and pianist who served as the head of the Janáček Music Academy in Brno from 1948 to 1961. His mother Milada Kunderová (born Janošíková) was an educator. His father died in 1971, and his mother in 1975.

Kundera learned to play the piano from his father and later studied musicology and musical composition. Musicological influences, references and notation can be found throughout his work. Kundera was a cousin of Czech writer and translator Ludvík Kundera. In his youth, having been supported by his father in his musical education, he was testing his abilities as a composer. One of his teachers at the time was Pavel Haas. His approach to music was eventually dampened due to his father not being able to launch a piano career for insisting on playing the music of modernist Jewish composer Arnold Schoenberg.

At the age of eighteen, he joined the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in 1947. In 1984, he recalled that &quot;Communism captivated me as much as Stravinsky, Picasso and Surrealism.&quot;

He attended lectures on music and composition at the Charles University in Prague but soon moved to the Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague (FAMU) to study film. In 1950, he was expelled from the party. After graduating, the Film Faculty appointed Kundera a lecturer in world literature in 1952. Following the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, he lost his job at the Film Faculty.
In 1956, Kundera also married for the first time, the operetta singer Olga Haas, the daughter of the composer and his teacher Pavel Haas and the doctor of Russian origin Sonia Jakobson, the first wife of Roman Jakobson.

== Political activism and professional career ==
His expulsion from the Communist party was described by Jan Trefulka in his novella &quot;Pršelo jim štěstí&quot; (&quot;Luck Rained on Them&quot;, 1962). Kundera also used the expulsion as an inspiration for the main theme of his novel &quot;Žert&quot; (&quot;The Joke&quot;, 1967), in which he ridiculed the ruling Communist party. In 1956 Kundera was readmitted to the party but was expelled for a second time in 1970. He took part in the Fourth Congress of the Czech Writers union in June 1967, where he delivered an impressive speech. In the speech he focused on the Czech effort to maintain a certain cultural independence among its larger European neighbours. Along with other reformist Communist writers such as Pavel Kohout, he was peripherally involved in the 1968 Prague Spring. This brief period of reformist activities was crushed by the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968. Kundera remained committed to reforming Czechoslovak Communism, and argued vehemently in print with fellow Czech writer Václav Havel, saying, essentially, that everyone should remain calm and that &quot;nobody is being locked up for his opinions yet,&quot; and &quot;the significance of the Prague Autumn may ultimately be greater than that of the Prague Spring.&quot; In 1968, the year his books were banned by the Czech Government, he made his first journey to Paris, where he befriended the publisher Claude Gallimard. After he returned to Prague, he was frequently visited by Gallimard who encouraged Kundera to emigrate to France and also smuggled the manuscript for &quot;Life Is Elsewhere&quot; out of Czechoslovakia. Finally, Kundera gave in and moved to France in 1975. In 1979, his Czechoslovak citizenship was revoked. He lectured for a few years at the University of Rennes. After three years, he moved to Paris.

==Works==
Although his early poetic works are staunchly pro-communist, his novels escape ideological classification. Kundera repeatedly insisted that he was a novelist rather than a politically motivated writer. Political commentary all but disappeared from his novels after the publication of &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot; except in relation to broader philosophical themes. Kundera&#x27;s style of fiction, interlaced with philosophical digression, was greatly inspired by the novels of Robert Musil and the philosophy of Nietzsche. In 1945 the journal &quot;Gong&quot; published his translation of some of the works from the Russian poet Vladimir Majakovsky. The next year the journal &quot;Mladé archy&quot; printed a poem of his, to which he was inspired by his cousin Ludvík Kundera, also a writer.

In the mid-1950s he was readmitted to the Communist party and he was able to publish &quot;Manː A Wide Garden&quot; in 1953, a long epic poem in 1955 called &quot;The Last May&quot; dedicated to Julius Fucik and the collection of lyrical poetry &quot;Monologue&quot; in 1957. Those, together with other fore and afterwords are deemed to be written in the fashion of uncontroversial propaganda which allowed him to benefit to a certain degree from the advantages that came with being an established writer in a Communist environment. In 1962 he wrote the play &quot;The Owners of the Keys,&quot; which became an international success and was translated into several languages. Kundera himself claimed inspiration from Renaissance authors such as Giovanni Boccaccio, Rabelais and, perhaps most importantly, Miguel de Cervantes, to whose legacy he considered himself most committed. Other influences include Laurence Sterne, Henry Fielding, Denis Diderot, Robert Musil, Witold Gombrowicz, Hermann Broch, Franz Kafka, Martin Heidegger and Georges Bataille. Originally he wrote in the Czech language, but from 1985 onwards, he made a conscious transition from Czech towards the French which has since become the reference language for his translations. Between 1985 and 1987, he undertook the revision of the French translations of his earlier works himself. With &quot;Slowness&quot; his first work in French was published in 1995. His works were translated into more than eighty languages.

===&quot;The Joke&quot;===

In his first novel, &quot;The Joke&quot; (1967), he satirized the totalitarianism of the Communist era. Following the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia in August 1968, the book was banned. His criticism of the Soviet invasion in 1968 led to his blacklisting in Czechoslovakia and the banning of his books.

===&quot;Life Is Elsewhere&quot;===

Kundera&#x27;s second novel was first published in French as &quot;La vie est ailleurs&quot; in 1973 and in Czech as in 1979. &quot;Life Is Elsewhere&quot; is a satirical portrait of the fictional poet Jaromil, a young and very naïve idealist who becomes involved in political scandals. For the novel Kundera was awarded the Prix Médicis the same year.

===&quot;The Book of Laughter and Forgetting&quot;===

In 1975, Kundera moved to France where &quot;The Book of Laughter and Forgetting&quot; was published in 1979. An unusual mixture of novel, short story collection, and authorial musings which came to characterize his works in exile, the book dealt with how Czechs opposed the Communist regime in various ways. Critics noted that the Czechoslovakia Kundera portrays &quot;is, thanks to the latest political redefinitions, no longer precisely there,&quot; which is the &quot;kind of disappearance and reappearance&quot; Kundera ironically explores in the book.

===&quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot;===

Kundera&#x27;s most famous work, &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot;, was published in 1984. The book chronicles the fragile nature of an individual&#x27;s fate, theorizing that a single lifetime is insignificant in the scope of Nietzsche&#x27;s concept of eternal return. In an infinite universe, everything is guaranteed to recur infinitely. In 1988, American director Philip Kaufman released a film adaptation, which Kundera disliked. The book focuses on the life of a Czech dissident surgeon&#x27;s journey from Prague to Zurich and his return to Prague, where he was not permitted to take up work as a surgeon. He worked instead as a window washer and used his job to arrange sex with hundreds of women. At the end he and his wife move to the country. The book was not published in Czechoslovakia due to Kundera&#x27;s fear it would be badly edited. He eventually delayed the publishing date for years and only in 2006 would an official translation be available in the Czech language. The book had previously been available in Czech, however, as a Czech expatriate in Canada had translated the book in 1985.

===&quot;Ignorance&quot;===

In 2000, &quot;Ignorance&quot; was published. The novel centres on the romance of two alienated Czech émigrés, two decades after the Prague Spring of 1968. It is thematically concerned with the suffering of emigration. In it, Kundera undermines the myths surrounding nostalgia and the émigré&#x27;s longing for return. He concludes that in the &quot;etymological light nostalgia seems something like the pain of ignorance, of not knowing.&quot; Kundera suggests a complex relationship between memory and nostalgia, writing that our memory can &quot;create rifts both with our earlier selves and between people who ostensibly share a past.&quot; The main characters of Irena and Josef discover how emigration and forgetfulness have ultimately freed them from their pain. Kundera draws heavily from the myth of Odysseus, specifically the &quot;mythology of home, the delusions of roots.&quot; Linda Asher translated the original French version of the novel to English in 2002.

=== &quot;The Festival of Insignificance&quot; ===

The 2014 novel focuses on the musings of four male friends living in Paris who discuss their relationships with women and the existential predicament confronting individuals in the world, among other things. The novel received generally negative reviews. Michiko Kakutani of the &quot;New York Times&quot; describes the book as being a &quot;knowing, pre-emptive joke about its own superficiality&quot;. A review in the &quot;Economist&quot; stated that the book was &quot;sadly let down by a tone of breezy satire that can feel forced&quot;.

==Writing style and philosophy==
François Ricard suggested that Kundera conceived his fiction with regard to the overall body of his work, rather than limiting his ideas to the scope of just one novel at a time, his themes and meta-themes traversing his entire œuvre. Each new book manifests the latest stage of his personal philosophy. Some of these meta-themes include exile, identity, life beyond the border (beyond love, beyond art, beyond seriousness), history as a continual return, and the pleasure of a less &quot;important&quot; life.

Many of Kundera&#x27;s characters seem to develop as expositions of one of these themes at the expense of their full humanity. Specifics in regard to the characters tend to be rather vague. Often, more than one main character is used in a novel; Kundera may have even completely discontinued a character, resuming the plot with somebody new. As he told Philip Roth in an interview in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;: &quot;Intimate life [is] understood as one&#x27;s personal secret, as something valuable, inviolable, the basis of one&#x27;s originality&quot;.

Kundera&#x27;s early novels explore the dual tragic and comic aspects of totalitarianism. He did not view his works, however, as political commentary. &quot;The condemnation of totalitarianism doesn&#x27;t deserve a novel&quot;, he said. According to the Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes, &quot;What he finds interesting is the similarity between totalitarianism and the immemorial and fascinating dream of a harmonious society where private life and public life form but one unity and all are united around one will and one faith&quot;. In exploring the dark humour of this topic, Kundera seems deeply influenced by Franz Kafka.

Kundera considered himself a writer without a message. In &quot;Sixty-three Words,&quot; a chapter in &quot;The Art of the Novel&quot;, Kundera tells of a Scandinavian publisher who hesitated to publish &quot;The Farewell Party&quot; because of its apparent anti-abortion message. Not only was the publisher wrong about the existence of such a message, Kundera explained, but, &quot;I was delighted with the misunderstanding. I had succeeded as a novelist. I succeeded in maintaining the moral ambiguity of the situation. I had kept faith with the essence of the novel as an art: irony. And irony doesn&#x27;t give a damn about messages!&quot;.

Kundera also ventured often into musical matters, analyzing Czech folk music for example; or quoting from Leoš Janáček and Bartók; or placing musical excerpts into the text, as in &quot;The Joke&quot;; or discussing Schoenberg and atonality.

==Miroslav Dvořáček controversy==
On 13 October 2008, the Czech weekly &quot;Respekt&quot; reported that an investigation was being carried out by the state-funded historical archive and research Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes, into whether a young Kundera had denounced a returned defector, Miroslav Dvořáček, to the StB, or Czechoslovak secret police, in 1950. The accusation was based on a police station report which named &quot;Milan Kundera, student, born 1.4.1929&quot; as the informant in regard to Dvořáček&#x27;s presence at a student dormitory. But the report did not include his ID card number, which was usually included, nor his signature. According to the police report, the ultimate source of the information about Dvořáček&#x27;s previous desertion from military service and defection to the West was Iva Militká.

Dvořáček had allegedly fled Czechoslovakia after being ordered to join the infantry in the wake of a purge of the flight academy, and returned to Czechoslovakia as an agent of an anti-communist espionage agency organised by Czechoslovak exiles, an allegation which was not mentioned in the police report. Dvořáček returned secretly to the student dormitory of a friend&#x27;s ex-girlfriend, Iva Militká. Militká was dating and later married a fellow student, Ivan Dlask, who knew Kundera. The police report alleges that Militká told Dlask of Dvořáček&#x27;s presence, and that Dlask told Kundera, who told the secret police. Although the prosecutor sought the death penalty, Dvořáček was sentenced to 22 years of hard labour, fined 10,000 crowns, stripped of personal property, and deprived of his civic rights for ten years. Dvořáček served 14 years in a labor camp, some of it working in a uranium mine, before he was released.

In his response to &quot;Respekt&quot;″s announcement, Kundera denied turning Dvořáček into the StB, stating he never knew him at all, and could not even remember an individual named &quot;Militká&quot;. On 14 October 2008, the Czech Security Forces Archive announced that they had ruled out the possibility that the document could be a forgery, but refused to arrive at any other definite conclusions. Vojtech Ripka of the Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes said, &quot;There are two pieces of circumstantial evidence [the police report and its sub-file], but we, of course, cannot be one hundred percent sure. Unless we find all survivors, which is unfortunately impossible, it will not be complete.&quot; Ripka added that the signature on the police report matches the name of a man who worked in the corresponding National Security Corps section and that a police protocol is missing.

Many in the Czech Republic condemned Kundera as a &quot;police informer&quot;, while many others accused &quot;Respekt&quot; of committing journalistic misconduct by publishing such a poorly researched piece. On the other hand, presenting an ID card was a procedure whenever dealing with the StB in 1950. Kundera was the student representative of the dorm Dvořáček had visited, and while it cannot be ruled out that another student could have denounced him to the StB using Kundera&#x27;s name, impersonating someone else in a Stalinist police state posed a significant risk. Contradictory statements by Kundera&#x27;s fellow students appeared in the Czech news media in the wake of this scandal. Historian Adam Hradílek, the co-author of the &quot;Respekt&quot; article, was also accused of an undeclared conflict of interest since one of the individuals involved in the incident was his aunt. Nonetheless, &quot;Respekt&quot; states on its website that its task is to &quot;impartially study the crimes of the former communist regime&quot;. With time, the Western journalists realized the whole controversy was flawed, with French newspapers defending Kundera. The literary scholar Karen de Kunes investigated the reports and came to the conclusion that even if Kundera had issued the report, all he reported was the existence of a suitcase in the hallway.

On 3 November 2008, eleven internationally recognized writers came to Kundera&#x27;s defence, including four Nobel laureates, Orhan Pamuk, Gabriel García Márquez, Nadine Gordimer and J. M. Coetzee, as well as Carlos Fuentes, Juan Goytisolo, Philip Roth, Salman Rushdie, and Jorge Semprún.

==Awards and honours==
In 1973, &quot;Life Is Elsewhere&quot; received the French Prix Médicis. In 1979 Kundera was awarded the Mondello Prize for The Farewell Party. In 1985, Kundera received the Jerusalem Prize. His acceptance address appears among the essays collected in &quot;The Art of the Novel&quot;. He won The Austrian State Prize for European Literature in 1987. In 2000, he was awarded the international Herder Prize. In 2007, he was awarded the Czech State Literature Prize. In 2009, he was awarded the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca. In 2010, he was made an honorary citizen of his hometown, Brno. When he died the Greek Newspaper &quot;Efimerida ton Syntakton&quot; (&quot;Journal of the editors&quot;) published a special section where all the current affairs on each page were described with a book title of Kundera&#x27;s.

In 2011, he received the Ovid Prize. The asteroid 7390 Kundera, discovered at the Kleť Observatory in 1983, is named in his honour. In 2020, he was awarded the Franz Kafka Prize, a Czech literary award.

== Personal life ==
Stripped of Czechoslovak citizenship in 1979, Kundera became a French citizen in 1981. He maintained contact with Czech and Slovak friends in his homeland, but rarely returned and never with any fanfare. He was granted Czech citizenship in 2019. He saw himself as a French writer and insisted his work should be studied as French literature and classified as such in bookstores.

Kundera was married twice. His first wife was the singer Olga Haasová-Smrčková (1937–2022), daughter of composer Pavel Haas, whom he married in 1956. His second marriage was to Věra Hrabánková (1935–2024), whom he married in 1967. Vera reportedly was his secretary, translator of his works and the gatekeeper between Kundera and the outside world.

Kundera died after a prolonged illness, in Paris on 11 July 2023, at the age of 94. He was cremated in Paris on 19 July 2023.

<text>Combinatorial chemistry comprises chemical synthetic methods that make it possible to prepare a large number (tens to thousands or even millions) of compounds in a single process. These compound libraries can be made as mixtures, sets of individual compounds or chemical structures generated by computer software. Combinatorial chemistry can be used for the synthesis of small molecules and for peptides.

Strategies that allow identification of useful components of the libraries are also part of combinatorial chemistry. The methods used in combinatorial chemistry are applied outside chemistry, too.

==Introduction==
The basic principle of combinatorial chemistry is to prepare libraries of a very large number of compounds and identify those which are useful as potential drugs or agrochemicals. This relies on high-throughput screening which is capable of assessing the output at sufficient scale.

Although combinatorial chemistry has only really been taken up by industry since the 1990s, its roots can be seen as far back as the 1960s when a researcher at Rockefeller University, Bruce Merrifield, started investigating the solid-phase synthesis of peptides. Synthesis of peptides in a combinatorial fashion quickly leads to large numbers of molecules. Using the twenty natural amino acids, for example, in a tripeptide creates 8,000 (203) possibilities. Solid-phase methods for small molecules were later introduced and Furka devised a &quot;split and mix&quot; approach

In its modern form, combinatorial chemistry has probably had its biggest impact in the pharmaceutical industry. Researchers attempting to optimize the activity profile of a compound create a &#x27;library&#x27; of many different but related compounds. Advances in robotics have led to an industrial approach to combinatorial synthesis, enabling companies to routinely produce over 100,000 new and unique compounds per year.

In order to handle the vast number of structural possibilities, researchers often create a &#x27;virtual library&#x27;, a computational enumeration of all possible structures of a given pharmacophore with all available reactants. Such a library can consist of thousands to millions of &#x27;virtual&#x27; compounds. The researcher will select a subset of the &#x27;virtual library&#x27; for actual synthesis, based upon various calculations and criteria (see ADME, computational chemistry, and QSAR). 

In 1996, at Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research, scientist Anthony Czarnik directed research and reported the first use of automation in synthesizing compound libraries. As the founding editor of the American Chemical Society&#x27;s Journal of Combinatorial Chemistry, he also led research into RFID tags for targeted sorting in compound library synthesis.

==Polymers (peptides and oligonucleotides) ==
=== Combinatorial split-mix (split and pool) synthesis ===

Combinatorial split-mix (split and pool) synthesis is based on the solid-phase synthesis developed by Merrifield. If a combinatorial peptide library is synthesized using 20 amino acids (or other kinds of building blocks) the bead form solid support is divided into 20 equal portions. This is followed by coupling a different amino acid to each portion. The third step is the mixing of all portions. These three steps comprise a cycle. Elongation of the peptide chains can be realized by simply repeating the steps of the cycle.
The procedure is illustrated by the synthesis of a dipeptide library using the same three amino acids as building blocks in both cycles. Each component of this library contains two amino acids arranged in different orders. The amino acids used in couplings are represented by yellow, blue and red circles in the figure. Divergent arrows show dividing solid support resin (green circles) into equal portions, vertical arrows mean coupling and convergent arrows represent mixing and homogenizing the portions of the support.

The figure shows that in the two synthetic cycles 9 dipeptides are formed. In the third and fourth cycles, 27 tripeptides and 81 tetrapeptides would form, respectively.

The &quot;split-mix synthesis&quot; has several outstanding features:

* It is highly efficient. As the figure demonstrates the number of peptides formed in the synthetic process (3, 9, 27, 81) increases exponentially with the number of executed cycles. Using 20 amino acids in each synthetic cycle the number of formed peptides are: 400, 8,000, 160,000 and 3,200,000, respectively. This means that the number of peptides increases exponentially with the number of the executed cycles.
* All peptide sequences are formed in the process that can be deduced by a combination of the amino acids used in the cycles.
* Portioning of the support into equal samples assures formation of the components of the library in nearly equal molar quantities.
* Only a single peptide forms on each bead of the support. This is the consequence of using only one amino acid in the coupling steps. It is completely unknown, however, which is the peptide that occupies a selected bead.
* The split-mix method can be used for the synthesis of organic or any other kind of library that can be prepared from its building blocks in a stepwise process.

In 1990 three groups described methods for preparing peptide libraries by biological methods and one year later Fodor et al. published a remarkable method for synthesis of peptide arrays on small glass slides.

A &quot;parallel synthesis&quot; method was developed by Mario Geysen and his colleagues for preparation of peptide arrays. They synthesized 96 peptides on plastic rods (pins) coated at their ends with the solid support. The pins were immersed into the solution of reagents placed in the wells of a microtiter plate. The method is widely applied particularly by using automatic parallel synthesizers. Although the parallel method is much slower than the real combinatorial one, its advantage is that it is exactly known which peptide or other compound forms on each pin.

Further procedures were developed to combine the advantages of both split-mix and parallel synthesis. In the method described by two groups the solid support was enclosed into permeable plastic capsules together with a radiofrequency tag that carried the code of the compound to be formed in the capsule. The procedure was carried out similar to the split-mix method. In the split step, however, the capsules were distributed among the reaction vessels according to the codes read from the radiofrequency tags of the capsules.
A different method for the same purpose was developed by Furka et al. is named &quot;string synthesis&quot;. In this method, the capsules carried no code. They are strung like the pearls in a necklace and placed into the reaction vessels in stringed form. The identity of the capsules, as well as their contents, are stored by their position occupied on the strings. After each coupling step, the capsules are redistributed among new strings according to definite rules.

==Small molecules==

In the drug discovery process, the synthesis and biological evaluation of small molecules of interest have typically been a long and laborious process. Combinatorial chemistry has emerged in recent decades as an approach to quickly and efficiently synthesize large numbers of potential
small molecule drug candidates. In a typical synthesis, only a single target molecule is produced at the end of a synthetic scheme, with each step in a synthesis producing only a single product. In a combinatorial synthesis, when using only single starting material, it is possible to synthesize a large library of molecules using identical reaction conditions that can then be screened for their biological activity. This pool of products is then split into three equal portions containing each of the three products, and then each of the three individual pools is then reacted with another unit of reagent B, C, or D, producing 9 unique compounds from the previous 3. This process is then repeated until the desired number of building blocks is added, generating many compounds. When synthesizing a library of compounds by a multi-step synthesis, efficient reaction methods must be employed, and if traditional purification methods are used after each reaction step, yields and efficiency will suffer.

Solid-phase synthesis offers potential solutions to obviate the need for typical quenching and purification steps often used in synthetic chemistry. In general, a starting molecule is adhered to a solid support (typically an insoluble polymer), then additional reactions are performed, and the final product is purified and then cleaved from the solid support. Since the molecules of interest are attached to a solid support, it is possible to reduce the purification after each reaction to a single filtration/wash step, eliminating the need for tedious liquid-liquid extraction and solvent evaporation steps that most synthetic chemistry involves. Furthermore, by using heterogeneous reactants, excess reagents can be used to drive sluggish reactions to completion, which can further improve yields. Excess reagents can simply be washed away without the need for additional purification steps such as chromatography.

Over the years, a variety of methods have been developed to refine the use of solid-phase organic synthesis in combinatorial chemistry, including efforts to increase the ease of synthesis and purification, as well as non-traditional methods to characterize intermediate products. Although
the majority of the examples described here will employ heterogeneous reaction media in every reaction step, Booth and Hodges provide an early example of using solid-supported reagents only during the purification step of traditional solution-phase syntheses. In their view,
solution-phase chemistry offers the advantages of avoiding attachment and cleavage reactions necessary to anchor and remove molecules to resins as well as eliminating the need to recreate solid-phase analogues of established solution-phase reactions.

The single purification step at the end of a synthesis allows one or more impurities to be removed, assuming the chemical structure of the offending impurity is known. While the use of solid-supported reagents greatly simplifies the synthesis of compounds, many combinatorial syntheses require multiple steps, each of which still requires some form of purification. Armstrong, et al. describe a one-pot method for generating combinatorial libraries, called multiple-component condensations (MCCs). In this scheme, three or more reagents react such that each reagent is incorporated into the final product in a single step, eliminating the need for a multi-step synthesis that involves many purification steps. In MCCs, there is no deconvolution required to determine which compounds are biologically active because each synthesis in an array has only a single product, thus the identity of the compound should be unequivocally known.

In another array synthesis, Still generated a large library of oligopeptides by split synthesis. The drawback to making many thousands of compounds is that it is difficult to determine the structure of the formed compounds. Their solution is to use molecular tags, where a tiny amount (1 pmol/bead) of a dye is attached to the beads, and the identity of a certain bead can be determined by analyzing which tags are present on the bead. Despite how easy attaching tags makes identification of receptors, it would be quite impossible to individually screen each compound for its receptor binding ability, so a dye was attached to each receptor, such that only those receptors that bind to their substrate produce a color change.

When many reactions need to be run in an array (such as the 96 reactions described in one of Armstrong&#x27;s MCC arrays), some of the more tedious aspects of synthesis can be automated to improve efficiency. This work, the &quot;DIVERSOMER method&quot; was pioneered at Parke-Davis in the early 1990s to run up to 40 chemical reactions in parallel. These efforts led to the first commercially available equipment for combinatorial chemistry (Diversomer synthesizer which was sold by Chemglass) and the first use of liquid handling robotics within a chemistry labortory. This method uses a device that automates the resin loading and wash cycles, as well as the reaction cycle monitoring and purification, and demonstrates the feasibility of their method and apparatus by using it to synthesize a variety of molecule classes, such as hydantoins and benzodiazepines, running 8 or 40 individual reactions in parallel. This and several other pioneering efforts in combinatorial chemistry were featured as &quot;classical&quot; papers in the field in 1999.

Oftentimes, it is not possible to use expensive equipment, and Schwabacher, et al. describe a simple method of combining parallel synthesis of library members and evaluation of entire libraries of compounds. In their method, a thread that is partitioned into different regions is wrapped around a cylinder, where a different reagent is then coupled to each region which bears only a single species. The thread is then re-divided and wrapped around a cylinder of a different size, and this process is then repeated. The beauty of this method is that the identity of each product can be known simply by its location along the thread, and the corresponding biological activity is identified by Fourier transformation of fluorescence signals.

In most of the syntheses described here, it is necessary to attach and remove the starting reagent to/from a solid support. This can lead to the generation of a hydroxyl group, which can potentially affect the biological activity of a target compound. Ellman uses solid phase supports in a multi-step synthesis scheme to obtain 192 individual 1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives, which are well-known therapeutic agents. To eliminate the possibility of potential hydroxyl group interference, a novel method using silyl-aryl chemistry is used to link the molecules to the solid support which cleaves from the support and leaves no trace of the linker.

When anchoring a molecule to a solid support, intermediates cannot be isolated from one another without cleaving the molecule from the resin. Since many of the traditional characterization techniques used to track reaction progress and confirm product structure are solution-based,
different techniques must be used. Gel-phase 13C NMR spectroscopy, MALDI mass spectrometry, and IR spectroscopy have been used to confirm structure and monitor the progress of solid-phase reactions. Gordon et al., describe several case studies that utilize imines and peptidyl phosphonates to generate combinatorial libraries of small molecules. To generate the imine library, an amino acid tethered to a resin is reacted in the presence of an aldehyde. The authors demonstrate the use of fast 13C gel phase NMR spectroscopy and magic angle spinning 1 H NMR spectroscopy to monitor the progress of reactions and showed that most imines could be formed in as little as 10 minutes at room temperature when trimethyl orthoformate was used as the solvent. The formed imines were then derivatized to generate 4-thiazolidinones, B-lactams, and pyrrolidines.

The use of solid-phase supports greatly simplifies the synthesis of large combinatorial libraries of compounds. This is done by anchoring a starting material to a solid support and then running subsequent reactions until a sufficiently large library is built, after which the products are cleaved from the support. The use of solid-phase purification has also been demonstrated for use in solution-phase synthesis schemes in conjunction with standard liquid-liquid extraction purification techniques.

==Deconvolution and screening==

===Combinatorial libraries===

Combinatorial libraries are special multi-component mixtures of small-molecule chemical compounds that are synthesized in a single stepwise process. They differ from collection of individual compounds as well as from series of compounds prepared by parallel synthesis.
It is an important feature that mixtures are used in their synthesis. The use of mixtures ensures the very high efficiency of the process. Both reactants can be mixtures and in this case the procedure would be even more efficient. For practical reasons however, it is advisable to use the split-mix method in which one of two mixtures is replaced by single building blocks (BBs). The mixtures are so important that there are no combinatorial libraries without using mixture in the synthesis, and if a mixture is used in a process inevitably combinatorial library forms. The split-mix synthesis is usually realized using solid support but it is possible to apply it in solution, too. Since he structures the components are unknown deconvolution methods need to be used in screening.
One of the most important features of combinatorial libraries is that the whole mixture can be screened in a single process. This makes these libraries very useful in pharmaceutical research.
Partial libraries of full combinatorial libraries can also be synthesized. Some of them can be used in deconvolution

===Deconvolution of libraries cleaved from the solid support===

If the synthesized molecules of a combinatorial library are cleaved from the solid support a soluble mixture forms. In such solution, millions of different compounds may be found. When this synthetic method was developed, it first seemed impossible to identify the molecules, and to find molecules with useful properties. Strategies for identification of the useful components had been developed, however, to solve the problem. All these strategies are based on synthesis and testing of partial libraries. An early iterative strategy was devised by Furka in 1982. The method was later independently published by Erb et al. under the name &quot;Recursive deconvolution&quot;
====Recursive deconvolution====

The method is made understandable by the figure. A 27-member peptide library is synthesized from three amino acids. After the first (A) and second (B) cycles samples were set aside before mixing them. The products of the third cycle (C) are cleaved down before mixing then are tested for activity. Suppose the group labeled by + sign is active. All members have the red amino acid at the last coupling position (CP). Consequently, the active member also has the red amino acid at the last CP. Then the red amino acid is coupled to the three samples set aside after the second cycle (B) to get samples D. After cleaving, the three E samples are formed. If after testing the sample marked by + is the active one it shows that the blue amino acid occupies the second CP in the active component. Then to the three A samples first the blue then the red amino acid is coupled (F) then tested again after cleaving (G). If the + component proves to be active, the sequence of the active component is determined and shown in H.

====Positional scanning====

Positional scanning was introduced independently by Furka et al. and Pinilla et al. The method is based on the synthesis and testing of series of sublibraries. in which a certain sequence position is occupied by the same amino acid. The figure shows the nine sublibraries (B1-D3) of a full peptide trimer library (A) made from three amino acids. In sublibraries there is a position which is occupied by the same amino acid in all components. In the synthesis of a sublibrary the support is not divided and only one amino acid is coupled to the whole sample. As a result, one position is really occupied by the same amino acid in all components. For example, in the B2 sublibrary position 2 is occupied by the &quot;yellow&quot; amino acid in all the nine components. If in a screening test this sublibrary gives positive answer it means that position 2 in the active peptide is also occupied by the &quot;yellow&quot; amino acid. The amino acid sequence can be determined by testing all the nine (or sometime less) sublibraries. 

====Omission libraries====

In omission libraries a certain amino acid is missing from all peptides of the mixture. The figure shows the full library and the three omission libraries. At the top the omitted amino acids are shown. If the omission library gives a negative test the omitted amino acid is present in the active component.

===Deconvolution of tethered combinatorial libraries===

If the peptides are not cleaved from the solid support we deal with a mixture of beads, each bead containing a single peptide. Smith and his colleagues showed earlier that peptides could be tested in tethered form, too. This approach was also used in screening peptide libraries. The tethered peptide library was tested with a dissolved target protein. The beads to which the protein was attached were picked out, removed the protein from the bead then the tethered peptide was identified by sequencing. 
A somewhat different approach was followed by Taylor and Morken. They used infrared thermography to identify catalysts in non-peptide tethered libraries. The method is based on the heat that is evolved in the beads that contain a catalyst when the tethered library immersed into a solution of a substrate. When the beads are examined through an infrared microscope the catalyst containing beads appear as bright spots and can be picked out.

====Encoded combinatorial libraries====

If we deal with a non-peptide organic libraries library it is not as simple to determine the identity of the content of a bead as in the case of a peptide one. In order to circumvent this difficulty methods had been developed to attach to the beads, in parallel with the synthesis of the library, molecules that encode the structure of the compound formed in the bead. 
Ohlmeyer and his colleagues published a binary encoding method They used mixtures of 18 tagging molecules that after cleaving them from the beads could be identified by Electron Capture Gas Chromatography. Sarkar et al. described chiral oligomers of pentenoic amides (COPAs) that can be used to construct mass encoded OBOC libraries. 
Kerr et al. introduced an innovative encoding method An orthogonally protected removable bifunctional linker was attached to the beads. One end of the linker was used to attach the non-natural building blocks of the library while to the other end encoding amino acid triplets were linked. The building blocks were non-natural amino acids and the series of their encoding amino acid triplets could be determined by Edman degradation. The important aspect of this kind of encoding was the possibility to cleave down from the beads the library members together with their attached encoding tags forming a soluble library. The same approach was used by Nikolajev et al. for encoding with peptides. 
In 1992 by Brenner and Lerner introduced DNA sequences to encode the beads of the solid support that proved to be the most successful encoding method. Nielsen, Brenner and Janda also used the Kerr approach for implementing the DNA encoding
In the latest period of time there were important advancements in DNA sequencing. The next generation techniques make it possible to sequence large number of samples in parallel that is very important in screening of DNA encoded libraries. There was another innovation that contributed to the success of DNA encoding. In 2000 Halpin and Harbury omitted the solid support in the split-mix synthesis of the DNA encoded combinatorial libraries and replaced it by the encoding DNA oligomers. In solid phase split and pool synthesis the number of components of libraries can&#x27;t exceed the number of the beads of the support. By the novel approach of the authors, this restraint was eliminated and made it possible to prepare new compounds in practically unlimited number. The Danish company Nuevolution for example synthesized a DNA encoded library containing 40 trillion! components
The DNA encoded libraries are soluble that makes possible to apply the efficient affinity binding in screening. Some authors apply the DEL for acromim of DNA encoded combinatorial libraries others are using DECL. The latter seems better since in this name the combinatorial nature of these libraries is clearly expressed.
Several types of DNA encoded combinatorial libraries had been introduced and described in the first decade of the present millennium. These libraries are very successfully applied in drug research.
* DNA templated synthesis of combinatorial libraries described in 2001 by Gartner et al.
* Dual pharmacophore DNA encoded combinatorial libraries invented in 2004 by Mlecco et al.
* Sequence encoded routing published by Harbury Halpin and Harbury in 2004.
* Single pharmacophore DNA encoded combinatorial libraries introduced in 2008 by Manocci et al.
* DNA encoded combinatorial libraries formed by using yoctoliter-scale reactor published by Hansen et al. in 2009
Details are found about their synthesis and application in the page DNA-encoded chemical library.
The DNA encoded soluble combinatorial libraries have drawbacks, too. First of all the advantage coming from the use of solid support is completely lost. In addition, the polyionic character of DNA encoding chains limits the utility of non-aqueous solvents in the synthesis. For this reason many laboratories choose to develop DNA compatible reactions for use in the synthesis of DECLs. Quite a few of available ones are already described

==Materials science==
Materials science has applied the techniques of combinatorial chemistry to the discovery of new materials. This work was pioneered by P.G. Schultz et al. in the mid-nineties in the context of luminescent materials obtained by co-deposition of elements on a silicon substrate. His work was preceded by J. J. Hanak in 1970 but the computer and robotics tools were not available for the method to spread at the time. Work has been continued by several academic groups as well as companies with large research and development programs (Symyx Technologies, GE, Dow Chemical etc.). The technique has been used extensively for catalysis, coatings, electronics, and many other fields. The application of appropriate informatics tools is critical to handle, administer, and store the vast volumes of data produced. New types of design of experiments methods have also been developed to efficiently address the large experimental spaces that can be tackled using combinatorial methods.

==Diversity-oriented libraries==
Even though combinatorial chemistry has been an essential part of early drug discovery for more than two decades, so far only one de novo combinatorial chemistry-synthesized chemical has been approved for clinical use by FDA (sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor indicated for advanced renal cancer). The analysis of the poor success rate of the approach has been suggested to connect with the rather limited chemical space covered by products of combinatorial chemistry. When comparing the properties of compounds in combinatorial chemistry libraries to those of approved drugs and natural products, Feher and Schmidt noted that combinatorial chemistry libraries suffer particularly from the lack of chirality, as well as structure rigidity, both of which are widely regarded as drug-like properties. Even though natural product drug discovery has not probably been the most fashionable trend in the pharmaceutical industry in recent times, a large proportion of new chemical entities still are nature-derived compounds, and thus, it has been suggested that effectiveness of combinatorial chemistry could be improved by enhancing the chemical diversity of screening libraries. As chirality and rigidity are the two most important features distinguishing approved drugs and natural products from compounds in combinatorial chemistry libraries, these are the two issues emphasized in so-called diversity oriented libraries, i.e. compound collections that aim at coverage of the chemical space, instead of just huge numbers of compounds.

== Patent classification subclass ==
In the 8th edition of the International Patent Classification (IPC), which entered into force on January 1, 2006, a special subclass has been created for patent applications and patents related to inventions in the domain of combinatorial chemistry: &quot;C40B&quot;.

<doc id="36681" wikidata="Q191949" url="?curid=36681" title="Brave New World">
<text>Brave New World is a dystopian novel by English author Aldous Huxley, written in 1931 and published in 1932. Largely set in a futuristic World State, whose citizens are environmentally engineered into an intelligence-based social hierarchy, the novel anticipates huge scientific advancements in reproductive technology, sleep-learning, psychological manipulation and classical conditioning that are combined to make a dystopian society which is challenged by the story&#x27;s protagonist. Huxley followed this book with a reassessment in essay form, &quot;Brave New World Revisited&quot; (1958), and with his final novel, &quot;Island&quot; (1962), the utopian counterpart. This novel is often compared as an inversion counterpart to George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;1984&quot; (1949).

In 1998 and 1999, the Modern Library ranked &quot;Brave New World&quot; at number 5 on its list of the 100 Best Novels in English of the 20th century. In 2003, Robert McCrum, writing for &quot;The Observer&quot;, included &quot;Brave New World&quot; chronologically at number 53 in &quot;the top 100 greatest novels of all time&quot;, and the novel was listed at number 87 on The Big Read survey by the BBC. &quot;Brave New World&quot; has frequently been banned and challenged since its original publication. It has landed on the American Library Association list of top 100 banned and challenged books of the decade since the association began the list in 1990.

==Title==
The title &quot;Brave New World&quot; derives from William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;, Act V, Scene I, Miranda&#x27;s speech:
 Shakespeare&#x27;s use of the phrase is intended ironically, as the speaker is failing to recognise the evil nature of the island&#x27;s visitors because of her innocence. Indeed, the next speaker—Miranda&#x27;s father Prospero—replies to her innocent observation with the statement Tis new to thee.&quot;

Translations of the title often allude to similar expressions used in domestic works of literature: the French edition of the work is entitled &quot;Le Meilleur des mondes&quot; (&quot;The Best of All Worlds&quot;), an allusion to an expression used by the philosopher Gottfried Leibniz and satirised in &quot;Candide, Ou l&#x27;Optimisme&quot; by Voltaire (1759). The first Standard Chinese translation, done by novelist Lily Hsueh and Aaron Jen-wang Hsueh in 1974, is entitled &quot;美麗新世界&quot; (Pinyin: &quot;Měilì Xīn Shìjiè&quot;, literally &quot;Beautiful New World&quot;).

==History==
Huxley wrote &quot;Brave New World&quot; while living in Sanary-sur-Mer, France, in the four months from May to August 1931. By this time, Huxley had established himself as a writer and social satirist. He was a contributor to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and &quot;Vogue&quot; magazines and had published a collection of his poetry (&quot;The Burning Wheel&quot;, 1916) and four satirical novels, &quot;Crome Yellow&quot; (1921), &quot;Antic Hay&quot; (1923), &quot;Those Barren Leaves&quot; (1925) and &quot;Point Counter Point&quot; (1928). &quot;Brave New World&quot; was Huxley&#x27;s fifth novel and first dystopian work.

A short passage in &quot;Crome Yellow&quot; foreshadows &quot;Brave New World&quot;, showing that Huxley had such a future in mind already in 1921. Mr. Scogan, one of the earlier book&#x27;s characters, describes an &quot;impersonal generation&quot; of the future that will &quot;take the place of Nature&#x27;s hideous system. In vast state incubators, rows upon rows of gravid bottles will supply the world with the population it requires. The family system will disappear; society, sapped at its very base, will have to find new foundations; and Eros, beautifully and irresponsibly free, will flit like a gay butterfly from flower to flower through a sunlit world&quot;.

Huxley said that &quot;Brave New World&quot; was inspired by the utopian novels of H. G. Wells, including &quot;A Modern Utopia&quot; (1905), and as a parody of &quot;Men Like Gods&quot; (1923). Wells&#x27; hopeful vision of the future gave Huxley the idea to begin writing a parody of the novels, which became &quot;Brave New World&quot;. He wrote in a letter to Mrs. Arthur Goldsmith, an American acquaintance, that he had &quot;been having a little fun pulling the leg of H. G. Wells&quot; but then he &quot;got caught up in the excitement of [his] own ideas&quot;. Unlike the most popular optimistic utopian novels of the time, Huxley sought to provide a frightening vision of the future. Huxley referred to &quot;Brave New World&quot; as a &quot;negative utopia&quot;, somewhat influenced by Wells&#x27;s own &quot;The Sleeper Awakes&quot; (dealing with subjects like corporate tyranny and behavioural conditioning) and the works of D. H. Lawrence.

For his part Wells published, two years after &quot;Brave New World&quot;, his Utopian &quot;Shape of Things to Come&quot;. Seeking to rebut the argument of Huxley&#x27;s Mustapha Mond—that moronic underclasses were a necessary &quot;social gyroscope&quot; and that a society composed solely of intelligent, assertive &quot;Alphas&quot; would inevitably disintegrate in internecine struggle—Wells depicted a stable egalitarian society emerging after several generations of a reforming elite having complete control of education throughout the world. In the future depicted in Wells&#x27; book, posterity remembers Huxley as &quot;a reactionary writer&quot;. The scientific futurism in &quot;Brave New World&quot; is believed to be appropriated from &quot;Daedalus&quot; by J. B. S. Haldane.

The events of the Great Depression in Britain in 1931, with its mass unemployment and the abandonment of the gold standard, persuaded Huxley to assert that stability was the &quot;primal and ultimate need&quot; if civilisation was to survive the present crisis. The &quot;Brave New World&quot; character Mustapha Mond, Resident World Controller of Western Europe, is named after Sir Alfred Mond. Shortly before writing the novel, Huxley visited the Billingham Manufacturing Plant, Mond&#x27;s technologically advanced factory near Billingham, north-east England, and it made a great impression on him.

Huxley used the setting and characters in his science fiction novel to express widely felt anxieties, particularly the fear of losing individual identity in the fast-paced world of the future. An early trip to the United States gave &quot;Brave New World&quot; much of its character. Huxley was outraged by the culture of youth, commercial cheeriness, sexual promiscuity and the inward-looking nature of many Americans; he had also found the book &quot;My Life and Work&quot; by Henry Ford on the boat to America and he saw the book&#x27;s principles applied in everything he encountered after leaving San Francisco.

==Plot==

The novel opens in the World State city of London in AF (After Ford) 632 (AD 2540 in the Gregorian calendar), where citizens are engineered through artificial wombs and childhood indoctrination programmes into predetermined classes (or castes) based on intelligence and labour. Lenina Crowne, a hatchery worker, is popular and sexually desirable, but Bernard Marx, a psychologist, is not. He is shorter in stature than the average member of his high caste, which gives him an inferiority complex. His work with sleep-learning allows him to understand, and disapprove of, his society&#x27;s methods of keeping its citizens peaceful, which includes their constant consumption of a soothing, happiness-producing drug called &quot;soma&quot;. Courting disaster, Bernard is vocal and arrogant about his criticisms, and his boss contemplates exiling him to Iceland because of his nonconformity. His only friend is Helmholtz Watson, a gifted writer who finds it difficult to use his talents creatively in their pain-free society.

Bernard takes a holiday with Lenina outside the World State to a Savage Reservation in New Mexico, in which the two observe natural-born people, disease, the ageing process, other languages, and religious lifestyles for the first time. The culture of the village folk resembles the contemporary Native American groups of the region, descendants of the Anasazi, including the Puebloan peoples of Hopi and Zuni. Bernard and Lenina witness a violent public ritual and then encounter Linda, a woman originally from the World State who is living on the reservation with her son John, now a young man. She, too, visited the reservation on a holiday many years ago, but became separated from her group and was left behind. She had meanwhile become pregnant by a fellow holidaymaker (who is revealed to be Bernard&#x27;s boss, the Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning). She did not try to return to the World State, because of her shame at her pregnancy. Despite spending his whole life in the reservation, John has never been accepted by the villagers, and his and Linda&#x27;s lives have been hard and unpleasant. Linda has taught John to read, although from the only book in her possession—a scientific manual—and another book found nearby by Popé: the complete works of Shakespeare. Ostracised by the villagers, John is able to articulate his feelings only in terms of Shakespearean drama, quoting often from &quot;The Tempest&quot;, &quot;King Lear&quot;, &quot;Othello&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Linda now wants to return to London, and John, too, wants to see this &quot;brave new world&quot; that his mother so often praised. Bernard sees an opportunity to thwart plans to exile him, and gets permission to take Linda and John back. On their return to London, John meets the Director and calls him his &quot;father&quot;, a vulgarity which causes a roar of laughter. The humiliated Director resigns in shame before he can follow through with exiling Bernard.

Bernard, as &quot;custodian&quot; of the &quot;savage&quot; John who is now treated as a celebrity, is fawned on by the highest members of society and revels in attention he once scorned. Bernard&#x27;s popularity is fleeting, though, and he becomes envious that John only really bonds with the literary-minded Helmholtz. Considered hideous and friendless, Linda spends all her time using soma, which she craved for so long, while John refuses to attend social events organised by Bernard, appalled by what he perceives to be an empty society. Lenina and John are physically attracted to each other, but John&#x27;s view of courtship and romance, based on Shakespeare&#x27;s writings, is utterly incompatible with Lenina&#x27;s freewheeling attitude to sex. She tries to seduce him, but he attacks her, before suddenly being informed that his mother is on her deathbed. He rushes to Linda&#x27;s bedside, causing a scandal, as this is not the &quot;correct&quot; attitude to death. Some children who enter the ward for &quot;death-conditioning&quot; come across as disrespectful to John, and he attacks one physically. He then tries to break up a distribution of soma to a lower-caste group, telling them that he is freeing them. Helmholtz and Bernard rush in to stop the ensuing riot, which the police quell by spraying soma vapor into the crowd.

Bernard, Helmholtz, and John are all brought before Mustapha Mond, the &quot;Resident World Controller for Western Europe&quot;, who tells Bernard and Helmholtz that they are to be exiled to islands for antisocial activity. Bernard pleads for a second chance, but Helmholtz welcomes the opportunity to be a true individual, and chooses the Falkland Islands as his destination, believing that their bad weather will inspire his writing. Mond tells Helmholtz that exile is actually a reward. The islands are full of the most interesting people in the world, individuals who did not fit into the social model of the World State. Mond outlines for John the events that led to the present society and his arguments for a caste system and social control. John rejects Mond&#x27;s arguments, and Mond sums up John&#x27;s views by claiming that John demands &quot;the right to be unhappy&quot;. John asks if he may go to the islands as well, but Mond refuses, saying he wishes to see what happens to John next.

Jaded with his new life, John moves to an abandoned hilltop lighthouse, near the village of Puttenham, where he intends to adopt a solitary ascetic lifestyle in order to purify himself of civilization, practising self-flagellation. This draws reporters and eventually hundreds of amazed sightseers, hoping to witness his bizarre behaviour.

For a while it seems that John might be left alone, after the public&#x27;s attention is drawn to other diversions, but a documentary maker has secretly filmed John&#x27;s self-flagellation from a distance, and when released the documentary causes an international sensation. Helicopters arrive with more journalists. Crowds of people descend on John&#x27;s retreat, demanding that he perform his whipping ritual for them. From one helicopter a young woman emerges who is implied to be Lenina. John, at the sight of a woman he both adores and loathes, whips at her in a fury and then turns the whip on himself, exciting the crowd, whose wild behaviour transforms into a soma-fuelled orgy. The next morning John awakes on the ground and is consumed by remorse over his participation in the orgy.

That evening, a swarm of helicopters appears on the horizon, with the story of last night&#x27;s orgy having been in all the papers. The first onlookers and reporters to arrive find that John is dead, having hanged himself.

==Characters==
Bernard Marx, a sleep-learning specialist at the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre. Although Bernard is an Alpha-Plus (the upper class of the society), he is a misfit. He is unusually short for an Alpha; an alleged accident with alcohol in Bernard&#x27;s blood-surrogate before his decanting has left him slightly stunted. Unlike his fellow utopians, Bernard is often angry, resentful, and jealous. At times, he is also cowardly and hypocritical. His conditioning is clearly incomplete. He does not enjoy communal sports, solidarity services, or promiscuous sex. He does not particularly enjoy soma. Bernard is in love with Lenina and does not like her sleeping with other men, even though &quot;everyone belongs to everyone else&quot;. Bernard&#x27;s triumphant return to utopian civilisation with John the Savage from the Reservation precipitates the downfall of the Director, who had been planning to exile him. Bernard&#x27;s triumph is short-lived; he is ultimately banished to an island for his non-conformist behaviour.

John, the illicit son of the Director and Linda, born and reared on the Savage Reservation (&quot;Malpais&quot;) after Linda was unwittingly left behind by her errant lover. John (&quot;the Savage&quot; or &quot;Mr. Savage&quot;, as he is often called) is an outsider both on the Reservation—where the natives still practise marriage, natural birth, family life and religion—and the ostensibly civilised World State, based on principles of stability and happiness. He has read nothing but the complete works of William Shakespeare, which he quotes extensively, and, for the most part, aptly, though his allusion to the &quot;Brave New World&quot; (Miranda&#x27;s words in &quot;The Tempest&quot;) takes on a darker and bitterly ironic resonance as the novel unfolds. John is intensely moral according to a code that he has been taught by Shakespeare and life in Malpais but is also naïve: his views are as imported into his own consciousness as are the hypnopedic messages of World State citizens. The admonishments of the men of Malpais taught him to regard his mother as a whore; but he cannot grasp that these were the same men who continually sought her out despite their supposedly sacred pledges of monogamy. Because he is unwanted in Malpais, he accepts the invitation to travel back to London and is initially astonished by the comforts of the World State. He remains committed to values that exist only in his poetry. He first spurns Lenina for failing to live up to his Shakespearean ideal and then the entire utopian society: he asserts that its technological wonders and consumerism are poor substitutes for individual freedom, human dignity and personal integrity. After his mother&#x27;s death, he becomes deeply distressed with grief, surprising onlookers in the hospital. He then withdraws himself from society and attempts to purify himself of &quot;sin&quot; (desire), but is unable to do so. His unusual behavior eventually attracts the attention of reporters and, later, huge amounts of people, who arrive in helicopters and make John furious with their behavior. Excited by his fury, people start an orgy, which he cannot resist joining. After waking up the next morning, John is horrified by his actions and hangs himself.

Helmholtz Watson, a handsome and successful Alpha-Plus lecturer at the College of Emotional Engineering and a friend of Bernard. He feels unfulfilled writing endless propaganda doggerel, and the stifling conformism and philistinism of the World State make him restive. Helmholtz is ultimately exiled to the Falkland Islands—a cold asylum for disaffected Alpha-Plus non-conformists—after reading a heretical poem to his students on the virtues of solitude and helping John destroy some Deltas&#x27; rations of soma following Linda&#x27;s death. Unlike Bernard, he takes his exile in his stride and comes to view it as an opportunity for inspiration in his writing. His first name derives from the German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz.

Lenina Crowne, a young, beautiful foetus technician at the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre. Lenina Crowne is a Beta who enjoys being a Beta. She is a vaccination worker with beliefs and values that are in line with a citizen of the World State. She is part of the 30% of the female population that are not freemartins (sterile women). Lenina is promiscuous and popular but somewhat quirky in her society: she had a four-month relation with Henry Foster, choosing not to have sex with anyone but him for a period of time. She is basically happy and well-conditioned, using soma to suppress unwelcome emotions, as is expected. Lenina has a date with Bernard, to whom she feels ambivalently attracted, and she goes to the Reservation with him. On returning to civilisation, she tries and fails to seduce John the Savage. John loves and desires Lenina but he is repelled by her forwardness and the prospect of pre-marital sex, rejecting her as an &quot;&quot;. Lenina visits John at the lighthouse but he attacks her with a whip, unwittingly inciting onlookers to do the same. Her exact fate is left unspecified.

Mustapha Mond, Resident World Controller of Western Europe, &quot;His Fordship&quot; Mustapha Mond presides over one of the ten zones of the World State, the global government set up after the cataclysmic Nine Years&#x27; War and great Economic Collapse. Sophisticated and good-natured, Mond is an urbane and hyperintelligent advocate of the World State and its ethos of &quot;Community, Identity, Stability&quot;. Among the novel&#x27;s characters, he is uniquely aware of the precise nature of the society he oversees and what it has given up to accomplish its gains. Mond argues that art, literature, and scientific freedom must be sacrificed to secure the ultimate utilitarian goal of maximising societal happiness. He defends the caste system, behavioural conditioning, and the lack of personal freedom in the World State: these, he says, are a price worth paying for achieving social stability, the highest social virtue because it leads to lasting happiness.

Fanny Crowne, Lenina Crowne&#x27;s friend (they have the same last name because only ten thousand last names are in use in a World State comprising two billion people). Fanny voices the conventional values of her caste and society, particularly the importance of promiscuity: she advises Lenina that she should have more than one man in her life because it is unseemly to concentrate on just one. Fanny then warns Lenina away from a new lover whom she considers undeserving, yet she is ultimately supportive of the young woman&#x27;s attraction to the savage John.

Henry Foster, one of Lenina&#x27;s many lovers, is a perfectly conventional Alpha male, casually discussing Lenina&#x27;s body with his coworkers. His success with Lenina, and his casual attitude about it, infuriate the jealous Bernard. Henry ultimately proves himself every bit the ideal World State citizen, finding no courage to defend Lenina from John&#x27;s assaults despite having maintained an uncommonly longstanding sexual relationship with her.

Benito Hoover, another of Lenina&#x27;s lovers. She remembers that he is particularly hairy when he takes his clothes off.

The Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning (DHC), also known as Thomas &quot;Tomakin&quot;, is the administrator of the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre, where he is a threatening figure who intends to exile Bernard to Iceland. His plans take an unexpected turn when Bernard returns from the Reservation with Linda (see below) and John, a child they both realise is actually his. This fact, scandalous and obscene in the World State, not because it was extramarital (which all sexual acts are), but because it was procreative, leads the Director to resign his post in shame.

, John&#x27;s mother, decanted as a Beta-Minus in the World State, originally worked in the DHC&#x27;s Fertilizing Room, and subsequently lost during a storm while visiting the New Mexico Savage Reservation with the Director many years before the events of the novel. Despite following her usual precautions, Linda became pregnant with the Director&#x27;s son during their time together and was therefore unable to return to the World State by the time that she found her way to Malpais. Having been conditioned to the promiscuous social norms of the World State, Linda finds herself at once popular with every man in the pueblo (because she is open to all sexual advances) and also reviled for the same reason, seen as a whore by the wives of the men who visit her and by the men themselves (who come to her nonetheless). Her only comforts there are &quot;mescal&quot; brought by Popé as well as &quot;peyotl&quot;. Linda is desperate to return to the World State and to soma, wanting nothing more from her remaining life than comfort until death.

The Arch-Community-Songster, the secular equivalent of the Archbishop of Canterbury in the World State society. He takes personal offense when John refuses to attend Bernard&#x27;s party.

The Director of Crematoria and Phosphorus Reclamation, one of the many disappointed, important figures to attend Bernard&#x27;s party.

The Warden, an Alpha-Minus, the talkative chief administrator for the New Mexico Savage Reservation. He is blond, short, broad-shouldered, and has a booming voice.

Darwin Bonaparte, a &quot;big game photographer&quot; (i.e., filmmaker) who films John flogging himself. Darwin Bonaparte became known for two works: &quot;feely of the gorillas&#x27; wedding&quot;, and &quot;Sperm Whale&#x27;s Love-life&quot;. He had already made a name for himself but still seeks more. He renews his fame by filming the savage, John, in his newest release &quot;The Savage of Surrey&quot;. His name alludes to Charles Darwin and Napoleon Bonaparte.

Dr. Shaw, Bernard Marx&#x27;s physician who consequently becomes the physician of both Linda and John. He prescribes a lethal dose of soma to Linda, which will stop her respiratory system from functioning in a span of one to two months, at her own behest but not without protest from John. Ultimately, they all agree that it is for the best, since denying her this request would cause more trouble for Society and Linda herself.

Dr. Gaffney, Provost of Eton, an Upper School for high-caste individuals. He shows Bernard and John around the classrooms, and the Hypnopaedic Control Room (used for behavioural conditioning through sleep learning). John asks if the students read Shakespeare but the Provost says the library contains only reference books because solitary activities, such as reading, are discouraged.

Miss Keate, Head Mistress of Eton Upper School. Bernard fancies her, and arranges an assignation with her.

===Others===
* Freemartins, women who have been deliberately made sterile by exposure to male hormones during foetal development but are still physically normal except for &quot;the slightest tendency to grow beards&quot;. In the book, government policy requires freemartins to form 70% of the female population.

===Of Malpais===
* Popé, a native of Malpais. Although he reinforces the behaviour that causes hatred for Linda in Malpais by sleeping with her and bringing her &quot;mescal&quot;, he still holds the traditional beliefs of his tribe. In his early years John attempted to kill him, but Popé brushed off his attempt and sent him fleeing. He gave Linda a copy of the Complete Works of Shakespeare. (Historically, Popé or Po&#x27;pay was a Tewa religious leader who led the Pueblo Revolt in 1680 against Spanish colonial rule.)
* Mitsima, an elder tribal shaman who also teaches John survival skills such as rudimentary ceramics (specifically coil pots, which were traditional to Native American tribes) and bow-making.
* Kiakimé, a native girl whom John fell for, but is instead eventually wed to another boy from Malpais.
* Kothlu, a native boy with whom Kiakimé is wed.

===Background figures===
These are non-fictional and factual characters who lived before the events in this book, but are of note in the novel:
* Henry Ford, who has become a messianic figure to the World State. &quot;Our Ford&quot; is used in place of &quot;Our Lord&quot;, as a credit to popularising the use of the assembly line.
* Sigmund Freud, &quot;Our Freud&quot; is sometimes said in place of &quot;Our Ford&quot; because Freud&#x27;s psychoanalytic method depends implicitly upon the rules of classical conditioning, and because Freud popularised the idea that sexual activity is essential to human happiness. (It is also strongly implied that citizens of the World State believe Freud and Ford to be the same person.)
* H. G. Wells, &quot;Dr. Wells&quot;, British writer and utopian socialist, whose book &quot;Men Like Gods&quot; was a motivation for &quot;Brave New World&quot;. &quot;All&#x27;s well that ends Wells&quot;, wrote Huxley in his letters, criticising Wells for anthropological assumptions Huxley found unrealistic.
* Ivan Pavlov, whose conditioning techniques are used to train infants.
* William Shakespeare, whose banned works are quoted throughout the novel by John, &quot;the Savage&quot;. The plays quoted include &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;The Tempest&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;King Lear&quot;, &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;, &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; and &quot;Othello&quot;. Mustapha Mond also knows them because as a World Controller he has access to a selection of books from throughout history, including the Bible.
* Thomas Robert Malthus, 19th century British economist, believed the people of the Earth would eventually be threatened by their inability to raise enough food to feed the population. In the novel, the eponymous character devises the contraceptive techniques (Malthusian belt) that are practiced by women of the World State.
* Reuben Rabinovitch, the Polish-Jew character on whom the effects of sleep-learning, hypnopædia, are first observed.
* John Henry Newman, 19th century Catholic theologian and educator, believed university education the critical element in advancing post-industrial Western civilization. Mustapha Mond and The Savage discuss a passage from one of Newman&#x27;s books.
* Alfred Mond, British industrialist, financier and politician. He is the namesake of Mustapha Mond.
* Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder and first President of Republic of Turkey. Naming Mond after Atatürk links up with their characteristics; he reigned during the time &quot;Brave New World&quot; was written and revolutionised the &#x27;old&#x27; Ottoman state into a new nation.

===Sources of names and references===
The limited number of names that the World State assigned to its bottle-grown citizens can be traced to political and cultural figures who contributed to the bureaucratic, economic, and technological systems of Huxley&#x27;s age, and presumably those systems in &quot;Brave New World&quot;.
* Soma: Huxley took the name for the drug used by the state to control the population after the Vedic ritual drink Soma, inspired by his interest in Indian mysticism.
* Malthusian belt: A contraceptive device worn by women. When Huxley was writing &quot;Brave New World&quot;, organizations such as the Malthusian League had spread throughout Europe, advocating contraception. Although the controversial economic theory of Malthusianism was derived from an essay by Thomas Malthus about the economic effects of population growth, Malthus himself was an advocate of abstinence rather than contraception.
*Bokanovsky&#x27;s Process: A scientific process used in the World State to mass-produce human beings. Specifically, the &quot;Bokanovsky Process&quot; is a method of producing multiple embryos from a single fertilized egg, creating up to 96 identical individuals. This technique is central to the society&#x27;s efforts to maintain social stability and control, as it allows for the creation of a standardized, docile workforce. It&#x27;s part of the larger theme in the novel of dehumanization and the reduction of individuality in the pursuit of a controlled, stable society. It is thought that the process&#x27;s name is a reference to Maurice Bokanowski, a French Bureaucrat who believed strongly in the idea of governmental and social efficiency. Complementing this, Podsnap&#x27;s Technique accelerates the maturation of human eggs, enabling the rapid production of thousands of nearly identical individuals. Together, these methods facilitate the creation of a large, standardized population, eliminating natural reproduction and traditional family structures, thereby reinforcing the World State&#x27;s control over its citizens.

==Reception==
Upon its publication, Rebecca West praised &quot;Brave New World&quot; as &quot;The most accomplished novel Huxley has yet written&quot;, Joseph Needham lauded it as &quot;Mr. Huxley&#x27;s remarkable book&quot;, and Bertrand Russell also praised it, stating, &quot;Mr. Aldous Huxley has shown his usual masterly skill in &quot;Brave New World.&quot;&quot; &quot;Brave New World&quot; also received negative responses from other contemporary critics, although his work was later embraced.

In an article in the 4 May 1935 issue of the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;, G. K. Chesterton explained that Huxley was revolting against the &quot;Age of Utopias&quot;. Much of the discourse on man&#x27;s future before 1914 was based on the thesis that humanity would solve all economic and social issues. In the decade following the war the discourse shifted to an examination of the causes of the catastrophe. The works of H. G. Wells and George Bernard Shaw on the promises of socialism and a World State were then viewed as the ideas of naive optimists. Chesterton wrote:

Similarly, in 1944 economist Ludwig von Mises described &quot;Brave New World&quot; as a satire of utopian predictions of socialism: &quot;Aldous Huxley was even courageous enough to make socialism&#x27;s dreamed paradise the target of his sardonic irony.&quot;

===Common misunderstandings===
Various authors assume that the book was first and foremost a cautionary tale regarding human genetic &quot;enhancement&quot;, indeed about – as an infamous report of Bush associate Leon Kass states –: &quot;producing improved [,][...] perfect or post-human&quot; people. In fact, the title itself has become a mere stand-in used to &quot;evoke the general idea of a futuristic dystopia&quot;.
Geneticist Derek So suggests that this is a misunderstanding, however. According to him, a &#x27;more careful reading of the text&#x27; shows that:
there does not seem to be any genetic testing in &quot;Brave New World&quot;, and most of the methods described involve hormones and chemicals rather than heritable interventions. Although Huxley wrote that &quot;eugenics and dysgenics were practiced systematically&quot;, this seems to refer only to selective breeding and not to any kind of direct manipulation on the genetic level. (The Bokanovsky process does represent a form of cloning, but this is not ethically equivalent to germline genome editing, and references to &quot;Brave New World&quot; may lead some readers to confuse the two technologies.) [...] While it&#x27;s true that the upper castes in &quot;Brave New World&quot; are smarter than the others, this is more because of the deliberate impairment of the lower castes than because the upper castes are &quot;perfect&quot;. Rather than reducing the number of individuals born with genetic disorders or handicaps, Huxley&#x27;s dystopia involves dramatically increasing their number. [...] Quite the opposite: Huxley thought that &quot;Brave New World&quot; might come about if we &quot;didn&#x27;t&quot; start selecting better children.
Overall, Derek So notes that &quot;Huxley was much more worried about totalitarianism than about the new biotechnologies per se that he alluded to in Brave New World.&quot;
Despite claims to the contrary then, Huxley remained a committed eugenicist all throughout his life, much like his comparably famous brother Julian, and one just as keen on stressing its humanistic underpinnings.

==The World State and Fordism==
The World State is built upon the principles of Henry Ford&#x27;s assembly line: mass production, homogeneity, predictability, and consumption of disposable consumer goods. While the World State lacks any supernatural-based religions, Ford himself is revered as the creator of their society but not as a deity, and characters celebrate Ford Day and swear oaths by his name (e.g., &quot;By Ford!&quot;). In this sense, some fragments of traditional religion are present, such as Christian crosses, which had their tops cut off to be changed to a &quot;T&quot;, representing the Ford Model T. In England, there is an Arch-Community-Songster of Canterbury, obviously continuing the Archbishop of Canterbury, and in America &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; continues publication as &quot;The Fordian Science Monitor&quot;. The World State calendar numbers years in the &quot;AF&quot; era—&quot;After Ford&quot;—with the calendar beginning in AD 1908, the year in which Ford&#x27;s first Model T rolled off his assembly line. The novel&#x27;s Gregorian calendar year is AD 2540, but it is referred to in the book as AF 632.

From birth, members of every class are indoctrinated by recorded voices repeating slogans while they sleep (called &quot;hypnopædia&quot; in the book) to believe their own class is superior, but that the other classes perform needed functions. Any residual unhappiness is resolved by an antidepressant and hallucinogenic drug called soma.

The biological techniques used to control the populace in &quot;Brave New World&quot; do not include genetic engineering; Huxley wrote the book before the structure of DNA was known. However, Gregor Mendel&#x27;s work with inheritance patterns in peas had been rediscovered in 1900 and the eugenics movement, based on artificial selection, was well established. Huxley&#x27;s family included a number of prominent biologists including Thomas Huxley, half-brother and Nobel Laureate Andrew Huxley, and his brother Julian Huxley who was a biologist and involved in the eugenics movement. Nonetheless, Huxley emphasises conditioning over breeding (nurture versus nature); human embryos and fetuses are conditioned through a carefully designed regimen of chemical (such as exposure to hormones and toxins), thermal (exposure to intense heat or cold, as one&#x27;s future career would dictate), and other environmental stimuli, although there is an element of selective breeding as well.

==Comparisons with George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;==
In a letter to George Orwell about &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, Huxley wrote &quot;Whether in actual fact the policy of the boot-on-the-face can go on indefinitely seems doubtful. My own belief is that the ruling oligarchy will find less arduous and wasteful ways of governing and of satisfying its lust for power, and these ways will resemble those which I described in Brave New World.&quot; He went on to write &quot;Within the next generation I believe that the world&#x27;s rulers will discover that infant conditioning and narco-hypnosis are more efficient, as instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging and kicking them into obedience.&quot;

Social critic Neil Postman contrasted the worlds of &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; and &quot;Brave New World&quot; in the foreword of his 1985 book &quot;Amusing Ourselves to Death&quot;. He writes:

The writer Christopher Hitchens, who published several articles on Huxley and a book on Orwell, noted the difference between the two texts in the introduction to his 1999 article &quot;Why Americans Are Not Taught History&quot;,

==&quot;Brave New World Revisited&quot;==
In 1946, Huxley wrote in the foreword of the new edition of &quot;Brave New World&quot;:


&quot;Brave New World Revisited&quot; (Harper &amp; Brothers, US, 1958; Chatto &amp; Windus, UK, 1959), written by Huxley almost thirty years after &quot;Brave New World&quot;, is a non-fiction work in which Huxley considered whether the world had moved toward or away from his vision of the future from the 1930s. He believed when he wrote the original novel that it was a reasonable guess as to where the world might go in the future. In &quot;Brave New World Revisited&quot;, he concluded that the world was becoming like &quot;Brave New World&quot; much faster than he originally thought.

Huxley analysed the causes of this, such as overpopulation, as well as all the means by which populations can be controlled. He was particularly interested in the effects of drugs and subliminal suggestion. &quot;Brave New World Revisited&quot; is different in tone because of Huxley&#x27;s evolving thought, as well as his conversion to Hindu Vedanta in the interim between the two books.

The last chapter of the book aims to propose action which could be taken to prevent a democracy from turning into the totalitarian world described in &quot;Brave New World&quot;. In Huxley&#x27;s last novel, &quot;Island&quot;, he again expounds similar ideas to describe a utopian nation, which is generally viewed as a counterpart to &quot;Brave New World&quot;.

== Censorship ==
According to American Library Association, &quot;Brave New World&quot; has frequently been banned and challenged in the United States due to insensitivity, offensive language, nudity, racism, drug use, conflict with a religious viewpoint, and being sexually explicit. It landed on the list of the top ten most challenged books in 2010 (3) and 2011 (7). The book also secured a spot on the association&#x27;s list of the top one hundred challenged books for 1990–1999 (54), 2000–2009 (36), and 2010–2019 (26).

The following include specific instances of when the book has been censored, banned, or challenged:
* In 1932, the book was banned in Ireland for its language, and for supposedly being anti-family and anti-religion.
* In 1965, a Maryland English teacher alleged that he was fired for assigning &quot;Brave New World&quot; to students. The teacher sued for violation of First Amendment rights but lost both his case and the appeal, with the appeals court ruling that the assignment of the book was not the reason for his firing.
* The book was banned in India in 1967, with Huxley accused of being a &quot;pornographer&quot;.
* In 1980, it was removed from classrooms in Miller, Missouri, among other challenges.
* The version of &quot;Brave New World Revisited&quot; published in China lacks explicit mentions of China itself.

==Influences and allegations of plagiarism==
The English writer Rose Macaulay published &quot;What Not: A Prophetic Comedy&quot; in 1918. &quot;What Not&quot; depicts a dystopian future where people are ranked by intelligence, the government mandates mind training for all citizens, and procreation is regulated by the state. Macaulay and Huxley shared the same literary circles and he attended her weekly literary salons.

Bertrand Russell felt &quot;Brave New World borrowed&quot; from his 1931 book &quot;The Scientific Outlook&quot;, and wrote in a letter to his publisher that Huxley&#x27;s novel was &quot;merely an expansion of the two penultimate chapters of &#x27;The Scientific Outlook.&#x27;&quot;

H. G. Wells&#x27; novel &quot;The First Men in the Moon&quot; (1901) used concepts that Huxley added to his story. Both novels introduce a society (in Wells&#x27; case, that of the Lunar natives) consisting of a specialized caste system, in which new generations are produced in vessels, where their designated caste is decided before birth by tampering with the fetus&#x27; development, and individuals are drugged down when they are not needed.

George Orwell believed that &quot;Brave New World&quot; must have been partly derived from the 1921 novel &quot;We&quot; by Russian author Yevgeny Zamyatin. However, in a 1962 letter to Christopher Collins, Huxley says that he wrote &quot;Brave New World&quot; long before he had heard of &quot;We&quot;. According to &quot;We&quot; translator Natasha Randall, Orwell believed that Huxley was lying. Kurt Vonnegut said that in writing &quot;Player Piano&quot; (1952), he &quot;cheerfully ripped off the plot of &quot;Brave New World&quot;, whose plot had been cheerfully ripped off from Yevgeny Zamyatin&#x27;s &quot;We&quot;&quot;.

In 1982, Polish author Antoni Smuszkiewicz, in his analysis of Polish science-fiction &quot;Zaczarowana gra&quot; (&quot;The Magic Game&quot;), presented accusations of plagiarism against Huxley. Smuszkiewicz showed similarities between &quot;Brave New World&quot; and two science fiction novels written earlier by Polish author Mieczysław Smolarski, namely &quot;Miasto światłości&quot; (&quot;The City of Light&quot;, 1924) and &quot;Podróż poślubna pana Hamiltona&quot; (&quot;Mr Hamilton&#x27;s Honeymoon Trip&quot;, 1928). Smuszkiewicz wrote in his open letter to Huxley: &quot;This work of a great author, both in the general depiction of the world as well as countless details, is so similar to two of my novels that in my opinion there is no possibility of accidental analogy.&quot;

Kate Lohnes, writing for &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, notes similarities between &quot;Brave New World&quot; and other novels of the era could be seen as expressing &quot;common fears surrounding the rapid advancement of technology and of the shared feelings of many tech-skeptics during the early 20th century&quot;. Other dystopian novels followed Huxley&#x27;s work, including C.S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot; (1945) and Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1949).

==Legacy==
In 1998–1999, the Modern Library ranked &quot;Brave New World&quot; fifth on its list of the 100 Best Novels in English of the 20th century. In 2003, Robert McCrum writing for &quot;The Observer&quot; included &quot;Brave New World&quot; chronologically at number 53 in &quot;the top 100 greatest novels of all time&quot;, and the novel was listed at number 87 on the BBC&#x27;s survey The Big Read.

On 5 November 2019, BBC News listed &quot;Brave New World&quot; on its list of the 100 Most Inspiring Novels. In 2021, &quot;Brave New World&quot; was one of six classic science fiction novels by British authors selected by Royal Mail to feature on a series of UK postage stamps.

<text>Linear predictive coding (LPC) is a method used mostly in audio signal processing and speech processing for representing the spectral envelope of a digital signal of speech in compressed form, using the information of a linear predictive model.

LPC is the most widely used method in speech coding and speech synthesis. It is a powerful speech analysis technique, and a useful method for encoding good quality speech at a low bit rate.

==Overview==
LPC starts with the assumption that a speech signal is produced by a buzzer at the end of a tube (for voiced sounds), with occasional added hissing and popping sounds (for voiceless sounds such as sibilants and plosives). Although apparently crude, this Source–filter model is actually a close approximation of the reality of speech production. The glottis (the space between the vocal folds) produces the buzz, which is characterized by its intensity (loudness) and frequency (pitch). The vocal tract (the throat and mouth) forms the tube, which is characterized by its resonances; these resonances give rise to formants, or enhanced frequency bands in the sound produced. Hisses and pops are generated by the action of the tongue, lips and throat during sibilants and plosives.

LPC analyzes the speech signal by estimating the formants, removing their effects from the speech signal, and estimating the intensity and frequency of the remaining buzz. The process of removing the formants is called inverse filtering, and the remaining signal after the subtraction of the filtered modeled signal is called the residue.

The numbers which describe the intensity and frequency of the buzz, the formants, and the residue signal, can be stored or transmitted somewhere else. LPC synthesizes the speech signal by reversing the process: use the buzz parameters and the residue to create a source signal, use the formants to create a filter (which represents the tube), and run the source through the filter, resulting in speech.

Because speech signals vary with time, this process is done on short chunks of the speech signal, which are called frames; generally, 30 to 50 frames per second give an intelligible speech with good compression.

==Early history==

Linear prediction (signal estimation) goes back to at least the 1940s when Norbert Wiener developed a mathematical theory for calculating the best filters and predictors for detecting signals hidden in noise. Soon after Claude Shannon established a general theory of coding, work on predictive coding was done by C. Chapin Cutler, Bernard M. Oliver and Henry C. Harrison. Peter Elias in 1955 published two papers on predictive coding of signals.

Linear predictors were applied to speech analysis independently by Fumitada Itakura of Nagoya University and Shuzo Saito of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone in 1966 and in 1967 by Bishnu S. Atal, Manfred R. Schroeder and John Burg. Itakura and Saito described a statistical approach based on maximum likelihood estimation; Atal and Schroeder described an adaptive linear predictor approach; Burg outlined an approach based on principle of maximum entropy.

In 1969, Itakura and Saito introduced method based on partial correlation (PARCOR), Glen Culler proposed real-time speech encoding, and Bishnu S. Atal presented an LPC speech coder at the Annual Meeting of the Acoustical Society of America. In 1971, realtime LPC using 16-bit LPC hardware was demonstrated by Philco-Ford; four units were sold. LPC technology was advanced by Bishnu Atal and Manfred Schroeder during the 1970s1980s. In 1978, Atal and Vishwanath &quot;et al.&quot; of BBN developed the first variable-rate LPC algorithm. The same year, Atal and Manfred R. Schroeder at Bell Labs proposed an LPC speech codec called adaptive predictive coding, which used a psychoacoustic coding algorithm exploiting the masking properties of the human ear. This later became the basis for the perceptual coding technique used by the MP3 audio compression format, introduced in 1993. Code-excited linear prediction (CELP) was developed by Schroeder and Atal in 1985.

LPC is the basis for voice-over-IP (VoIP) technology. In 1972, Bob Kahn of ARPA with Jim Forgie of Lincoln Laboratory (LL) and Dave Walden of BBN Technologies started the first developments in packetized speech, which would eventually lead to voice-over-IP technology. In 1973, according to Lincoln Laboratory informal history, the first real-time 2400 bit/s LPC was implemented by Ed Hofstetter. In 1974, the first real-time two-way LPC packet speech communication was accomplished over the ARPANET at 3500 bit/s between Culler-Harrison and Lincoln Laboratory.

==LPC coefficient representations==
LPC is frequently used for transmitting spectral envelope information, and as such it has to be tolerant of transmission errors. Transmission of the filter coefficients directly (see linear prediction for a definition of coefficients) is undesirable, since they are very sensitive to errors. In other words, a very small error can distort the whole spectrum, or worse, a small error might make the prediction filter unstable.

There are more advanced representations such as log area ratios (LAR), line spectral pairs (LSP) decomposition and reflection coefficients. Of these, especially LSP decomposition has gained popularity since it ensures the stability of the predictor, and spectral errors are local for small coefficient deviations.

==Applications==
LPC is the most widely used method in speech coding and speech synthesis. It is generally used for speech analysis and resynthesis. It is used as a form of voice compression by phone companies, such as in the GSM standard, for example. It is also used for secure wireless, where voice must be digitized, encrypted and sent over a narrow voice channel; an early example of this is the US government&#x27;s Navajo I.

LPC synthesis can be used to construct vocoders where musical instruments are used as an excitation signal to the time-varying filter estimated from a singer&#x27;s speech. This is somewhat popular in electronic music.
Paul Lansky made the well-known computer music piece notjustmoreidlechatter using linear predictive coding.
A 10th-order LPC was used in the popular 1980s Speak &amp; Spell educational toy.

LPC predictors are used in Shorten, MPEG-4 ALS, FLAC, SILK audio codec, and other lossless audio codecs.

LPC has received some attention as a tool for use in the tonal analysis of violins and other stringed musical instruments.

<text>David is a masterpiece of Italian Renaissance sculpture in marble created from 1501 to 1504 by Michelangelo. With a height of , the &quot;David&quot; was the first colossal marble statue made in the High Renaissance, and since classical antiquity, a precedent for the 16th century and beyond. &quot;David&quot; was originally commissioned as one of a series of statues of twelve prophets to be positioned along the roofline of the east end of Florence Cathedral, but was instead placed in the public square in front of the Palazzo della Signoria, the seat of civic government in Florence, where it was unveiled on 8 September 1504. In 1873, the statue was moved to the Galleria dell&#x27;Accademia, Florence. In 1910 a replica was installed at the original site on the public square.

The biblical figure David was a favoured subject in the art of Florence. Because of the nature of the figure it represented, the statue soon came to symbolize the defence of civil liberties embodied in the 1494 constitution of the Republic of Florence, an independent city-state threatened on all sides by more powerful rival states and by the political aspirations of the Medici family.

==History==
===Commission===
The history of the statue of David begins before Michelangelo&#x27;s work on it from 1501 to 1504. The commission was made during a decisive period in the history of the Florentine republic established after the expulsion of the Medici. The advantages of democratic government never materialized, and internal circumstances grew worse as dangers from without increased. Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s successors and their supporters were a constant threat to the republic, and it was in defiance of the menace they represented that the project of a marble David was renewed.

The Overseers of the Office of Works, known as the &quot;Operai del Duomo&quot;, were officers of the &quot;Opera di Santa Maria del Fiore&quot;, the organization charged with the construction and maintenance of the new Cathedral of Florence. The &quot;Operai&quot; consisted of a 12-member committee that organized competitions, chose the best entries, commissioned the prevailing artists, and paid for the finished work. Most of them were members of the influential woolen cloth guild, the Arte della Lana. They had plans long before Michelangelo&#x27;s involvement to commission a series of twelve large sculptures of Old Testament prophets for the twelve spurs, or protrusions, generated by the four diagonal buttresses that helped support the enormous weight of the cathedral dome.

In 1410, Donatello had made the first of the series of statues, a colossal figure of Joshua in terracotta, gessoed and painted white to give it the appearance of marble at a distance. Although Charles Seymour Jr says Donatello&#x27;s protégé Agostino di Duccio was commissioned in 1463 to create a terracotta figure of Hercules for the series, almost certainly under the supervision of Donatello, Paoletti writes that &quot;The term &#x27;hercules&#x27; may not be a specific indication of the subject of the figure but simply a synonym... used at the time for a &#x27;giant&#x27; or very large figure.&quot;

Ready to continue their project, in 1464 the &quot;Operai&quot; contracted Agostino to create a marble sculpture of the young David, a symbol of Florence, to be mounted high on the eastern end of the &quot;Duomo&quot;. This was to be formed in the Roman manner from several blocks of marble, but in 1465 Agostino himself went to Carrara, a town in the Apuan Alps, and acquired a very large block of &quot;bianco ordinario&quot; from the Fantiscritti quarry. He began work on the statue but got only as far as beginning to shape the torso, legs, and feet, roughing out drapery, and possibly hollowing a hole between the legs. For unknown reasons his work on the block of marble halted with the death of his master Donatello in 1466. Antonio Rossellino, also a Florentine, was commissioned in 1476 to resume the work, but the contract was apparently rescinded, and the block lay neglected and exposed to the weather in the yard of the cathedral workshop for another twenty-five years. This was of great concern to the &quot;Operai&quot; authorities, as such a large piece of marble was not only costly, but represented considerable labour and difficulty in its transportation to Florence.

In 1500, an inventory of the cathedral workshops described the piece as &quot;a certain figure of marble called David, badly blocked out and supine.&quot; A year later, documents showed that the &quot;Operai&quot; were determined to find an artist who could take this large piece of marble and turn it into a finished work of art. They ordered that the block of stone, which they called &quot;il gigante&quot; (the giant), be &quot;raised on its feet&quot; so that a master experienced in this kind of work might examine it and express an opinion. Though Leonardo da Vinci among others was consulted, and Andrea Sansovino was also keen to get the commission, it was Michelangelo, at 26 years of age, who convinced the &quot;Operai&quot; that he deserved the commission. On 16 August 1501, Michelangelo was given the official contract to undertake this task. It said (English translation of the Latin text):

He began carving the statue early in the morning on 13 September, a month after he was awarded the contract. The contract provided him a workspace in the &quot;Opera di Santa Maria del Fiore&quot; behind the &quot;Duomo&quot;, paid him a salary of six &quot;fiorini&quot; per month, and allowed him two years to complete the sculpture.

When the finished statue was moved from the Opera del Duomo to the Piazza della Signoria over the course of four days, as reported by two contemporary diarists, Luca Landucci and Pietro di Marco Parenti, a guard was placed to protect it from violence by other artists in Florence who had hoped for the commission. They were hostile to Michelangelo because of his bold request to the wardens of the Cathedral and the governor of the city, Piero Soderini. Despite the precaution, the sculpture was damaged by stones, leaving still visible marks on the upper part of its back. Four youths from prominent Florentine families were subsequently arrested by the Otto di Guardia and all but one were imprisoned for what may have been simple vandalism without a political motive.

===Process===
Michelangelo regarded a single block of stone as containing all the possible conceptions for a work of art, and believed that the artist&#x27;s task is sculpting the marble block to reveal the ideal form within, an expression of his Neo-Platonic belief that body and mind are separate, and must work in concert and strive to attain union with one another and with the divine. In later years, speaking of his early commissions sculpting marble, he contended that he was merely liberating figures that were already existent in the stone, and that he could see them in his mind&#x27;s eye.

Giorgio Vasari wrote of Michelangelo sculpting the &quot;Prisoners&quot; that his method was to chisel the parts in highest relief first, then gradually revealing the lower parts. According to Franca Falletti, the passage describes Michelangelo&#x27;s process of working marble in general. Lengthy preparatory work was done before the actual sculpting began – this included sketches, drawings and the making of small-scale terracotta or wax models. After these preliminary studies he went directly to sculpting the marble, using the method described by Vasari. He chiseled layer after layer from the main face of the stone, and then gradually more and more of the other sides. The unfinished state of the &quot;Prisoners&quot; demonstrates this process, and &quot;David&quot; must have been sculpted in the same manner.

The massive block of white marble that was to become the &quot;David&quot;, measuring nine &quot;braccia&quot; in length, was of &quot;bianco ordinario&quot; grade stone, rather than the superior &quot;statuario&quot;. It came from the old Roman Fantiscritti quarry at the centre of the Carrara marble basins, and had been transported by oxen-pulled carts to the sea, whence it was carried on barges dragged by oxen up the river Arno to Florence.

The Operai del Duomo had raised the block to an upright position prior to the first inspection of their purchase, but a scaffolding had to be built so that Michelangelo could reach every part. The artist, who made his steel chisels himself, began cutting the stone with the &quot;subbia&quot;, a heavy, pointed iron tool used to rough out the main mass, before he employed the two-toothed shorter blade called the &quot;calcagnuolo&quot;. By the time he began to use the three-toothed &quot;gradina&quot;, a serrated claw chisel whose marks are seen in his unfinished sculptures, the basic form of the statue was emerging from the matrix. When he sculpted &quot;David&quot;&#x27;s hair and the pupils of his eyes, he used the &quot;trapano&quot;, a drill worked with a bow, like the ancient sculptors.

Michelangelo did without flat chisels in his sculpturing, and brought his pieces to the state of &quot;non finito&quot; almost entirely with toothed chisels. During the 2003 restoration of &quot;David&quot;, Italian researchers observed marks of the &quot;subbia&quot;, the sharpened &quot;subbia da taglio&quot;, the slightly flattened &quot;unghietto&quot; (fingernail), and the &quot;gradina&quot;, as well as marks from a smaller-toothed chisel, the &quot;dente di cane&quot; (dog&#x27;s tooth). They found no evidence of Michelangelo using flat chisels in the work.

A node of marble on the &quot;gigante&quot; that Michelangelo chiseled away before he began work on &quot;David&quot; in earnest has been interpreted by historians as a knot of drapery, based on the surmise that Agostino di Duccio&#x27;s figure was intended to be clothed. Irving Lavin proposes that the node may have been a point, that is, a knob of marble left purposely by Agostino as a fixed reference for a mechanical transfer measuring off his statue from the model. Lavin suggests that Agostino&#x27;s aborted attempt was the result of an error in his pointing system, and that if his conjecture is correct, it may illuminate a note added in the margin next to the passage in the commission giving &quot;il gigante&quot; to Michelangelo: 

===Placement===

On 25 January 1504, when the sculpture was nearing completion, Florentine authorities had to acknowledge there would be little possibility of raising the 5.17 metre high statue weighing approximately 8.5 tons to the roof of the cathedral. They convened a committee of 30 Florentine citizens that included many artists, including Leonardo da Vinci and Sandro Botticelli, to decide on an appropriate site for &quot;David&quot;. While nine different locations for the statue were discussed, the majority of members seem to have been closely split between two sites.

One group, led by Giuliano da Sangallo and supported by Leonardo and Piero di Cosimo, among others, believed that, due to the imperfections in the marble, the sculpture should be placed under the roof of the Loggia dei Lanzi on Piazza della Signoria; the other group thought it should stand at the entrance to the Palazzo della Signoria, the city&#x27;s town hall (now known as Palazzo Vecchio). Another opinion, shared by Botticelli and Cosimo Rosselli, was that the sculpture should be situated in front of the cathedral.

In June 1504, &quot;David&quot; was installed next to the entrance to the Palazzo della Signoria, replacing Donatello&#x27;s bronze sculpture of &quot;Judith and Holofernes&quot;, which also embodied a theme of heroic resistance. It took four days to move it the half mile from the cathedral&#x27;s workshop into the Piazza della Signoria. The statue was suspended in a wooden frame and rolled on fourteen greased logs by more than 40 men. Later that summer, the sling and tree-stump support were gilded, and the figure was given a gilt loin-garland.

===Later history===
In 1525 the block of marble intended to be the pendant for the &quot;David&quot; fell off a barge into the river Arno as it was being transported to Florence. Vasari wrote that it had jumped into the river in despair when it heard that Baccio Bandinelli would be carving it rather than Michelangelo, to whom the commission for a colossal statue of &quot;Hercules and Cacus&quot; at the entrance to the Palazzo della Signoria had originally been given.
In the mid-1800s, small cracks were noticed on the left leg on the &quot;David&quot;, which can possibly be attributed to an uneven sinking of the ground under the massive statue.
In 1873, it was removed from the piazza to protect it from damage, and was moved to the Accademia Gallery where it would attract many visitors. The sculpture was secured in a wheeled wooden crate, and moved slowly across the city from 30 July to 10 August that year. Its 16th-century base, said to be decrepit in contemporary reports, was lost when the crate was disassembled. A model of the crate is in the Museo di Casa Buonarroti, the house-museum in Florence&#x27;s Via Ghibellina where Michelangelo lived. The statue was not placed in its permanent setting in the Accademia until 1882. The architect Emilio De Fabris, professor at the Accademia, designed a tribune to house the &quot;David&quot; in a vaulted interior exedra, towards the apse, where it was bathed in light that streamed in through windows in the dome above. A replica was placed in the Piazza della Signoria in 1910.

In 1991, Piero Cannata, an artist whom the police described as deranged, attacked the statue with a hammer he had concealed beneath his jacket and damaged the second toe of the left foot. He later said that a 16th-century Venetian painter&#x27;s model ordered him to do so. Cannata was restrained by museum patrons until the police arrived. Fragments fell to the floor, and three tourists were caught by guards as they were trying to leave the gallery with pieces in their pockets.

The state of preservation of the &quot;David&quot; has been monitored and evaluated since 2000 using high-resolution 3D scanning, photogrammetry, finite element method (FEM) analyses, and &quot;in situ&quot; fracture monitoring through fibre optic Bragg gratings. These observations have shown that in its present vertical orientation, with the basal plinth horizontal, the centre of gravity of the base does not align with the &quot;David&quot;&#x27;s centre of gravity. Nevertheless, FEM analysis suggests that the statue is stable in its current position and indicates that its forward inclination of 1 degree to 3 degrees has played a major part in the development of cracks in the ankles.
In 2006, Borri and Grazini, using historical analysis and a finite element model of the &quot;David&quot;, identified the probable cause of the cracks in its legs as a slight forward inclination of the statue that developed after the flood of 1844 in Florence. The statue being located outdoors in front of the Palazzo della Signoria (Palazzo Vecchio) from 1504 to 1873, this inclination likely occurred because of the &quot;uneven subsidence and rotation of the statue&#x27;s foundations&quot;. Further damage occurred with the additional weight placed on the statue when, in 1847, Clemente Papi made a plaster mould composed of more than 1,500 separate segments, some weighing as much as 680 kg. The sculpture was also inclined on other occasions, such as when it was moved in 1873 to its placement in the Galleria dell&#x27;Accademia, after which the tilt was corrected. Ultrasonic crack assessment tests carried out by Pascale and Lolli in 2014 determined that cracks in the &quot;broncone&quot;, the tree trunk against which the &quot;David&quot;&#x27;s right leg rests, are the most worrisome of those in the statue. The left ankle and the area where the left heel and the base are attached also show cracks of critical concern.

Some scholars have suggested that the relative weakness caused by the cracks in its legs could make the statue vulnerable to the vibrations of foot traffic from visitors to the gallery. Nearly a million and a half tourists (about four thousand people each day it is open) visit the Accademia Gallery annually to see the &quot;David&quot;. In 2015, Pieraccini et al. measured its dynamic movements with interferometric radar. Measurements were made of such displacements on two days: Monday, 27 July and Tuesday, 28 July 2015; on Monday the Accademia is closed, while Tuesday is statistically the peak attendance day. Their results did not show a significant increase in the vibration amplitude on days the Accademia was open, compared to days it was closed.

In 2010, a dispute over the ownership of &quot;David&quot; arose when, based on a legal review of historical documents, the municipality of Florence claimed ownership of the statue in opposition to the Italian Culture Ministry, which disputes the municipal claim.
==Interpretation==
The pose of Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;David&quot; is unlike that of earlier Renaissance depictions of David. The bronze statues by Donatello and Verrocchio represented the hero standing victorious over the head of Goliath, and the painter Andrea del Castagno had shown the boy in mid-swing, even as Goliath&#x27;s head rested between his legs, but no earlier Florentine artist had omitted the giant altogether. According to such scholars as Howard Hibbard, &quot;David&quot; is depicted &quot;before&quot; his battle with Goliath. Rather than being shown victorious over a foe much larger than he, &quot;David&quot; looks wary as he sizes up the giant Goliath before the battle has actually taken place. His brow is drawn, his neck tense, and the veins bulge out of his lowered right hand. His left hand holds a sling that is draped over his shoulder and down to his right hand, which holds the handle of the sling.

The twist of his body in &quot;contrapposto&quot;, standing with most of its weight on his right foot and the other leg forward, effectively conveys to the viewer a sense of potential energy, the feeling that he is about to move. The statue is a Renaissance interpretation of a common ancient Greek theme of the standing heroic male nude. In the Renaissance, contrapposto poses were thought of as a distinctive feature of antique sculpture, initially manifested in the Doryphoros of Polykleitos (c. 440 BC). This is typified in &quot;David&quot;; this classic pose causes both hips and shoulders to rest at opposing angles, giving a slight s-curve to the entire torso. The contrapposto stance is emphasized by the left leg stepping forward, and by the contrasting positions of the arms: the left arm raised with its hand to the shoulder and the other hand touching the thigh.

Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;David&quot; has become one of the most recognized works of Renaissance sculpture; a symbol of strength and youthful beauty. The colossal size of the statue alone impressed Michelangelo&#x27;s contemporaries. Vasari described it as &quot;certainly a miracle that Michelangelo was able to raise up one who had died&quot;, and then listed all of the largest and most grand of the ancient statues that he had ever seen, concluding that Michelangelo&#x27;s work surpassed &quot;all ancient and modern statues, whether Greek or Latin, that have ever existed.&quot;

The proportions of the &quot;David&quot; are atypical of Michelangelo&#x27;s work as well as of antique models; the figure has an unusually large head and hands (particularly apparent in the right hand). These enlargements may be due to the fact that the statue was originally intended to be placed on the cathedral roofline, where the important parts of the sculpture may have been accentuated in order to be visible from below. The small size of the genitals, though, is in line with his other works and with Renaissance conventions in general. The statue is unusually slender (front to back) in comparison to its height, which may be a result of the work done on the block before Michelangelo began carving it.

A naturalistic rendition of the nude human body, if rendered successfully, has an erotic aspect. Vasari alludes to the statue&#x27;s sexual locus when he acclaims the figure&#x27;s &quot;very divine flanks&quot;. The flanks (&quot;fianchi&quot;) frame this part of the body, the nexus of its carnality. Antonio Forcellino calls the &quot;David&quot;&#x27;s sexual organs &quot;the most disquieting genitals of Renaissance sculpture&quot;, referring to the manner in which the small bulge, typical of adolescence, frames a tuft of pubic hair that &quot;supports a penis full of energy and displays the testicles, also full of vigour&quot;.
Commentators have noted the presence of a foreskin on &quot;David&quot; penis, which may appear at odds with the Judaic practice of circumcision. An artistic deviation from what very likely would have been accurately portrayed as a circumcised penis, it is in keeping with the conventions of Renaissance art, in which the Christ Child, for example, is represented as being uncircumcised, although clearly older than the eight days compelled by Jewish scripture.

==Political implications==
David the giant-killer had long been seen as a political symbol in Florence, and images of the biblical hero already carried political implications there. Donatello&#x27;s bronze &quot;David,&quot; made for Cosimo de&#x27; Medici, perhaps 1440, had been appropriated by the Signoria in 1494, when the Medici were exiled from Florence, and the statue was installed in the courtyard of the Palazzo della Signoria, where it symbolized the Republican government of the city. According to Levine, by placing Michelangelo&#x27;s statue in the same general location, it is likely that the &quot;David&quot; was conceived as politically controversial before Michelangelo began work on it, as well as an artistic response to that earlier work. While the originally intended location for the &quot;David&quot; was high up on the cathedral, its location was still in question. The commission, consisting of the most prominent artists of the day, debated in great detail the best placement for the colossal figure to be seen and appreciated, with consideration for its &quot;aria&quot;, &quot;moda&quot;, and &quot;qualità&quot; (its aura, style, and excellence). The political overtones led to the statue being attacked twice in its early days. Protesters pelted it with stones the year it debuted, and, in 1527, an anti-Medici riot resulted in its left arm being broken into three pieces. Giorgio Vasari later claimed that he and his friend Francesco Silviati, although just boys, braved the violence and saved the pieces, storing them in Silviati&#x27;s father&#x27;s house.

Machiavelli wrote of the long Florentine tradition that represented David as defender of the &quot;patria&quot;, a convention most completely developed in the arts – especially in the series of statues, from Donatello&#x27;s to Michelangelo&#x27;s, depicting him as the protector of his people. Having returned the armour given him by King Saul, and choosing to fight Goliath with his own weapons – a sling and a knife – David personified the citizen soldier of Florence, and the city&#x27;s ability to defend itself with its own arms.

Rather than placing Goliath&#x27;s severed head between or underneath the &quot;David&quot;&#x27;s feet, Michelangelo carved the stump of a tree on the back of the right leg, a device conventionally employed by sculptors in ancient times to help support the weight of a statue. In a contemporary document the stump was called &quot;broncone&quot;, the same Italian word used for Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s personal emblem, or &quot;impresa&quot; – a dead branch of laurel sprouting new green growth. Soon after &quot;David&#x27;s&quot; installation in front of the Palazzo della Signoria, certain adornments were added that have since disappeared: the stump and the strap of the sling were gilded, a vine of copper leaves was strung around the groin covering the genitals, and a laurel wreath of gilt bronze was added.

The gilt garland of leaves did not entirely negate the figure&#x27;s erotic aura. Machiavelli penned a brief text in satirical vein describing the laws of an imaginary society devoted to seeking pleasure. Its people were required to violate all the normal rules of society and decorum, and were punished with even more pleasurable tasks if they failed to satisfy these demands. For example, women offenders would be forced to gaze at the &quot;David&quot; closely, &quot;with eyeglasses&quot; (a notable product of the city).

According to Paoletti, a naked colossus situated in the primary public space of the city was necessarily politically charged, the &quot;David&quot;&#x27;s nakedness being more than merely a reference to the sculpture of antiquity that inspired the arts in the Italian Renaissance. Standing at the entrance to Florence&#x27;s town hall, it had power as a political symbol, using an image of the sexualized human body to represent the corporality of the Florentine body politic. As a civic metaphor, it resonated with the everyday life experiences of 16th-century Florentine people among all the social classes.

==Pedestal==

Kathleen Weil-Garris Brandt makes the case that pedestals are of great significance for Renaissance sculpture, and, following Rosalind Krauss, that it is the support, not the statue itself that decides the monumentality of a work of sculpture. She describes how the pedestal that supports the &quot;David&quot; has been neglected in the literature as a component of Michelangelo&#x27;s extraordinary achievement with his completion of the statue, and is usually not seen in photographs. The bases of most Renaissance statues have historically suffered a similar fate. When Michelangelo was young, pedestals were seldom a matter of much consideration to the sculptor; freestanding sculpture executed by contemporaries was rare and was made to surmount antique or new columns. &quot;Imbasamento&quot; is the Italian word generally used for the supports of sculpture; these and other kinds of pedestals were customarily made by &quot;scarpellini&quot;, that is, professional carvers of architectural ornament, or ideally by other sculptors.

On 11 June 1504, the architects in charge of the transportation of the statue to the Palazzo della Signoria, Simone del Pollaiolo and Antonio da Sangallo the Elder, were ordered by the &quot;Operai&quot; of the Cathedral to make a marble base &quot;subtus et circum circa pedes gigantis&quot; (underneath and around the feet of the giant). Because the &quot;David&quot; was already situated, the pedestal apparently consisted of a sheath surrounding a core rather than a solid block of stone meant to support the weight of the statue. As it was architects who built and installed the pedestal, they have been credited entirely for its execution, but Brandt thinks it more likely to have been Michelangelo&#x27;s idea.

According to Brandt, the &quot;David&quot; marked a pivotal event in the history of pedestals: the first still existent use in the Renaissance of an antique architectural socle form to support a sculptural colossus. Practical considerations such as the support&#x27;s ability to bear the weight and the difficulty of installation were necessarily taken into account, but otherwise its dimensions and form were a matter of free discretion. Nevertheless, the pedestal was not an arbitrary decorative element that could be exchanged for another. In one sense it was an extension of the architectural surroundings, but its form responded to the figure it supports. Thereafter, pedestals would become integral parts of sculptures.

Alison Wright, drawing on the work of social historian Richard Trexler, calls the innovative installation of statues in the Piazza della Signoria in 16th-century Florence the &quot;greatest public forum for the display of modern freestanding sculpture in Renaissance Italy&quot;, a reflection of the importance given in the city to upholding collective and personal honour. The pedestal created for Michelangelo&#x27;s colossus was novel in this social context, installed as the terminus of the balustrade that stood before the town hall, the Palazzo della Signoria. Considered within this framing of the performative and ritual functions of the city&#x27;s important sites, pedestals expressed the will to do honour in public and sacred spaces.

==Conservation==
Officials responsible for the artistic heritage of Florence had become concerned about the &quot;David&quot;&#x27;s physical state by the middle of the 19th century. A cleaning of the statue had apparently occurred about 1746, and in 1813 the sculptor Stefano Ricci gave the statue a gentle cleaning and applied a thin coat of encaustic,
consisting of beeswax, possibly mixed with linseed oil, to its surface as a protective coating. The sculptor Lorenzo Bartolini recommended in 1842 that a thorough conservation of the statue should be performed, and, like most of the advisory committee formed in 1504, that the &quot;David&quot; be moved to the Loggia della Signoria for its protection. In 1843 the sculptor Aristodemo Costoli cleaned the statue with a 50 per cent hydrochloric acid solution that removed the encaustic coating and left the marble surface pitted and porous, damaging the statue far more than the weathering it had suffered in the previous 400 years.

During World War II, &quot;David&quot;, along with Michelangelo&#x27;s other sculptures in the Accademia, was packed in sand and entombed in brick to protect it from being damaged.

In 1991, the left foot of the statue was damaged by an unemployed Italian man named Piero Cannata, who was carrying a hammer he had hidden under his jacket and broke off the tip of the second toe. The samples obtained from that incident allowed scientists, utilising spectroscopic, isotopic and petrographic analysis simultaneously, to determine that the marble used was obtained from the Fantiscritti quarries in Miseglia, the central of three small valleys in Carrara. The chemists and spectroscopists who conducted these tests say the marble of the &quot;David&quot; consists entirely of the mineral calcite.

Because of the marble&#x27;s surface degradation, on the eve of the 500th anniversary of the sculpture&#x27;s unveiling in 2004 the statue was given its first major cleaning since 1843. A scientific committee was formed to advise in the restoration. The committee was composed of university professors and scientists from the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (National Research Council) and the Opificio delle Pietre Dure, a government art-restoration department. They carried out tests and analyses and determined that the statue should be cleaned by poultices soaked in distilled water and applied to the sculpture&#x27;s surface. Agnese Parronchi, the restorer originally selected by Florentine museums superintendent Antonio Paolucci, assessed the &quot;David&quot;&#x27;s condition herself by examining hundreds of photographs and performing a series of tests. Consequently, she opposed the committee&#x27;s pre-specified method, fearing further deterioration, and insisted that it should be cleaned dry, with soft brushes and motorized erasers. Paolucci demanded that she use the wet pack method instead, but Parronchi refused. After Parronchi resigned, restorer Cinzia Parnigoni undertook the job of restoring the statue under the direction of Franca Falletti, director of the Accademia Gallery.

Researchers at the University of Siena (Università di Siena) performed an investigation of the small cavities, about a millimetre in diameter and of irregular distribution, with which the marble surface of the &quot;David&quot; is covered. Their macroscopic examination determined that the cavities have not resulted from deterioration of the stone, but rather that they can be attributed to the mineralogical structure of the marble taken from quarries in the Apuan Alps. The local quarrymen in their dialect call those less than a millimetre in size &quot;taròli&quot; and those several millimetres or larger they call &quot;tarme&quot;. Observation with optical fibres and magnifying lenses shows that the marble immediately surrounding the cavity may present milky white or greyish &quot;halos&quot; averaging a few millimetres wide. Many of them are completely or partly filled with various substances; this deposition is caused by the statue&#x27;s exposure over centuries to atmospheric agents or to past restoration processes.

As of 2024 temporary scaffolding is erected around the statue every two months and in an operation that takes a half a day, dust and spider&#x27;s webs are removed using soft-bristled brushes of various sizes and a bristle tipped vacuum cleaner.

===Replicas===
Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;David&quot; has stood on display at Florence&#x27;s Galleria dell&#x27;Accademia since 1873. On 29 August 1846, Grand Duke Leopold II of Tuscany commissioned Clemente Papi, a student of Stefano Ricci, to make a plaster cast of the &quot;David&quot;. Papi, a master bronze caster, was experienced in making moulds and reproductions, and set about the project in the summer of 1847. He probably used wax to release the mould rather than oil or fat. This was less damaging than the encaustic wax used by Ricci in 1813, but residue from the gypsum of the plaster mould appears to be present in places where removing coatings is difficult, such as between the &quot;David&quot;&#x27;s toes.

This cast was to be moved to various locations in the city to determine their suitability for the statue. Papi first made two plaster replicas of the marble &quot;David&quot; from his moulds, one of which was given in 1857 by Leopold II to Queen Victoria of England. A decree by the Tuscan state on 2 October 1858 ordered the casting of the entire figure of the &quot;David&quot;, which Papi completed in August 1866, sending the finished statue to the 1867 Paris Exposition the next year. His intention had always been to cast a bronze replica, and this cast was eventually raised on the Piazzale Michelangelo in 1875 to commemorate the fourth centenary of Michelangelo&#x27;s birth.

The statue sent to Queen Victoria was intended as a diplomatic gesture by Duke Leopoldo II to assuage any ill feelings caused by his refusal to allow the sending of a notable Domenico Ghirlandaio painting from Florence to London. Apparently Queen Victoria was surprised to receive such a gift, and gave the statue to the newly opened South Kensington Museum, now the Victoria and Albert Museum. Papi&#x27;s copy, which was sent to the Accademia di delle Belle Arti of Florence where it resides in the Gipsoteca (Gallery of Plaster Casts) of the Istituto Statale d&#x27;Arte, has been used to make all subsequent casts of the &quot;David&quot;.

The plaster cast of &quot;David&quot; at the Victoria and Albert Museum has a detachable plaster fig leaf which is displayed nearby. The fig leaf was created in response to Queen Victoria&#x27;s apparent shock upon first viewing the statue&#x27;s nudity, and was hung on the figure by means of two strategically placed hooks prior to royal visits.

On 12 November 2010, a fibreglass replica of &quot;David&quot; was installed atop a buttress on a corner of the north tribune below the roofline of Florence Cathedral for a week. Photographs of the installation reveal the statue the way the &quot;Operai&quot; who commissioned the work originally expected it to be seen.

Michelangelo&#x27;s statue is the best known and the most often reproduced of all the artistic works created in Florence. Later reproductions have been made in plaster and in simulated marble fibreglass, signifying an attempt to lend an atmosphere of culture even in some unlikely settings such as beach resorts, gambling casinos and model railroads. Some parody reproductions feature uncharacteristic embellishments, such as a 1966 reproduction, called “Leather David”, that captured attention in San Francisco for portraying David in leather attire.

<doc id="36685" wikidata="Q374087" url="?curid=36685" title="Emperor Go-Ichijō">
<text>was the 68th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

Go-Ichijō&#x27;s reign spanned the years from 1016 through 1036.

This 11th century sovereign was named after his father, Emperor Ichijō, and &quot;go-&quot; (後), translates literally as &quot;later&quot;; thus, he is sometimes called the &quot;Later Emperor Ichijō&quot;, or, in some older sources, may be identified as &quot;Emperor Ichijō, the second&quot;, or even &quot;Emperor Ichijō II&quot;.

==Biography==
Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was Atsuhira &quot;-shinnō&quot; (敦成親王). He was also known as Atsunari&quot;-shinnō&quot;.

Atsuhira was the second son of Emperor Ichijō. His mother, Fujiwara no Akiko/Shōshi (藤原彰子) (988–1074), was a daughter of Fujiwara no Michinaga. In her later years, Ichijō&#x27;s &quot;chūgo&quot; consort was known as Jōtō-mon In (上東門院).

==Events of Go-Ichijō&#x27;s life==
Atsuhira&quot;-shinnō&quot; was used as a pawn in Imperial court politics when he was only a child.

* 1012 (&quot;Chōwa 1, 8th month&quot;): Prince Atsuhira marries a daughter of &quot;sesshō&quot; and later &quot;kampaku&quot; Fujiwara no Michinaga.

Atsuhira became emperor at the age of 8, upon the abdication of his first cousin once removed, Emperor Sanjō.

* March 10, 1016 (&quot;Chōwa 5, 29th day of the 1st month&quot;): In the 5th year of Emperor Sanjō&#x27;s reign (三条天皇五年), he abdicated; and the succession (‘‘senso’’) was received by a cousin. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Go-Ichijō is said to have acceded to the throne (‘‘sokui’’).

During the initial years of Go-Ichijō&#x27;s reign, Fujiwara no Michinaga actually ruled from his position as &quot;sesshō&quot; (regent).

* June 5, 1017 (&quot;Kannin 1, 9th day of the 5th month&quot;): The former-Emperor Sanjō died at the age of 41.
* 1017 (&quot;Kannin 1, 8th month&quot;): Prince Atsuakira, the eldest son of Emperor Sanjo, had been named Crown Prince. But after he is struck by a skin disease and intense pressure from Michinaga; he withdrew from this role and his younger brother, Prince Atsunaga, was named Crown Prince in his place.
* 1017 (&quot;Kannin 1, 9th month&quot;): Michinaga made a pilgrimage to the Iwashimizu Shrine accompanied by many courtiers. The travelers divided themselves amongst 15 boats for a floating trip down the Yotogawa River. One of the vessels overturned, and more than 30 people lost their lives.
* 1017 (&quot;Kannin 1, 12th month&quot;): Michinaga was elevated to the office of &quot;Daijō-Diajin&quot;.
* May 15, 1036 (&quot;Chōgen 9, 17th day of the 4th month&quot;): Emperor Go-Ichijō died at the age of 27.

The actual site of Go-Ichijō&#x27;s grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Kyoto.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Go-Ichijō&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Bodaijuin no misasagi&quot;.

===Kugyō===
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Go-Ichijō&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Sesshō&quot;, Fujiwara Michinaga, 966–1027.
* &quot;Sesshō&quot;, Fujiwara Yorimichi, 992–1074.
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Fujiwara Yorimichi.
* &quot;Daijō-daijin&quot;, Fujiwara Michinaga.
* &quot;Daijō-daijin&quot;, Kan&#x27;in Kinsue, 956–1029.
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, Fujiwara Michinaga.
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, Fujiwara Akimitsu, 944–1021.
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, Fujiwara Yorimichi.
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Fujiwara Sanesuke, 957–1046.
* &quot;Nadaijin&quot;, Fujiwara Norimichi, 997–1075.

<doc id="36688" wikidata="Q349296" url="?curid=36688" title="Emperor Go-Suzaku">
<text>was the 69th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

Go-Suzaku&#x27;s reign spanned the years from 1036 through 1045.

This 11th-century sovereign was named after the 10th-century Emperor Suzaku and &quot;go-&quot; (後), translates literally as &quot;later;&quot; and thus, he is sometimes called the &quot;Later Emperor Suzaku&quot;. The Japanese word &quot;go&quot; has also been translated to mean the &quot;second one;&quot; and in some older sources, this emperor may be identified as &quot;Suzaku, the second&quot; or as &quot;Suzaku II.&quot;

==Biography==
Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (his &quot;imina&quot;) was Atsunaga&quot;-shinnō&quot; (敦良親王).

His father was Emperor Ichijō. His mother was Fujiwara no Akiko/Shōshi (藤原彰子), the daughter of Fujiwara no Michinaga (藤原道長). He was the younger brother and heir to Emperor Go-Ichijō.

Go-Suzaku had five Empresses and seven Imperial children.

==Events of Go-Suzaku&#x27;s life==
* May 15, 1036 (&quot;Chōgen 9, 17th day of the 4th month&quot;) : In the 9th year of Emperor Go-Ichijō&#x27;s reign (後一条天皇九年), he died; and the succession (‘‘senso’’) was received by his younger brother.
* 1036 (&quot;Chōgen 9, 7th month&quot;): Emperor Go-Suzaku is said to have acceded to the throne (‘‘sokui’’).
* February 5, 1045 (&quot;Kantoku 2, 16th day of the 1st month&quot;): Emperor Go-Suzaku abdicated.
* February 7, 1045 (&quot;Kantoku 2, 18th day of the 1st month&quot;): The former-Emperor Go-Suzaku ordained as a Buddhist monk and died the same day at the age of 37. His reign has lasted nine years—five in the &quot;nengō&quot; &quot;Chōryaku&quot;, four in &quot;Chōkyu&quot;, and 2 in &quot;Kantoku&quot;.
The actual site of Go-Suzaku&#x27;s grave is unknown. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Kyoto.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Go-Suzaku&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Enjō-ji no misasagi&quot;.

Go-Suzaku is buried amongst the &quot;Seven Imperial Tombs&quot; at Ryōan-ji Temple in Kyoto.

The specific mound which commemorates the Hosokawa Emperor Go-Suzaku is today named &quot;Shu-zan.&quot;

The emperor&#x27;s burial place would have been quite humble in the period after Go-Suzaku died.

These tombs reached their present state as a result of the 19th century restoration of imperial sepulchers (&quot;misasagi&quot;) which were ordered by Emperor Meiji.

The final resting place of Emperor Go-Suzaku&#x27;s consort, Teishi Nai-shinnō (1013–1094), is here as well.

* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, Fujiwara Yorimichi, 992–1074.

<doc id="36691" wikidata="Q356060" url="?curid=36691" title="Emperor Go-Reizei">
<text>was the 70th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

Go-Reizei&#x27;s reign spanned the years 1045–1068.

This 11th century sovereign was named after the 10th century Emperor Reizei and &quot;go-&quot; (後), translates literally as &quot;later&quot;; and thus, he is sometimes called the &quot;Later Emperor Reizei&quot;. The Japanese word &quot;go&quot; has also been translated to mean the &quot;second one&quot;; and in some older sources, this emperor may be identified as &quot;Reizei, the second&quot;, or as &quot;Reizei II&quot;.

==Biography==
Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was Chikahito&quot;-shinnō&quot; (親仁親王). He was the eldest son of Emperor Go-Suzaku. His mother was Fujiwara no Kishi (藤原嬉子), formerly Naishi-no kami, daughter of Fujiwara no Michinaga. Go-Reizei had three Empresses and no Imperial sons or daughters.

==Events of Go-Reizei&#x27;s life==
When Emperor Go-Suzaku abdicated on February 5, 1045, his eldest son received the succession (‘‘senso’’) on the same day. Emperor Go-Reizei formally acceded to the throne (‘‘sokui’’) shortly after, and the era name was changed the following year to mark the beginning of his reign. His father Go-Suzaku died at the age of 37 on February 7, 1045, of unknown causes The one major event in Go-Reizei&#x27;s life occurred in the year 1051, when Abe no Sadatō and Munetō instigated a rebellion that became known as the Zenkunen War (1051–1062). In response, Minamoto no Yoriyoshi is appointed governor of Mutsu and he is named &quot;chinjufu shōgun.&quot; He is given these titles and powers so that he will be able to restore peace in the north. Yoriyoshi would have been the first to receive this specific shogunal title, although his grandfather (Minamoto no Tsunemoto) had been &quot;seitō fuku-shōgun&quot; (assistant commander for pacification of the east). Go-Reizei later died on May 22, 1068, at the age of 44 leaving no direct heirs to the throne. He was succeeded by his father&#x27;s second son Takahito-shinnō aka Emperor Go-Sanjō.

The actual site of Go-Reizei&#x27;s grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) though at Kyoto. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Go-Reizei&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Enkyo-ji no misasagi&quot;. Go-Reizei is buried amongst the &quot;Seven Imperial Tombs&quot; at Ryōan-ji Temple in Kyoto. The mound which commemorates the Hosokawa Emperor Go-Reizei is today named &quot;Shu-zan.&quot; The emperor&#x27;s burial place would have been quite humble in the period after Go-Reizei died. These tombs reached their present state as a result of the 19th century restoration of imperial sepulchers (&quot;misasagi&quot;) which were ordered by Emperor Meiji.

===Kugyō===
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Go-Reizei&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Fujiwara Yorimichi, 992–1074.
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Fujiwara Norimichi, 997–1075.

The title is eventually claimed by Conrad the Salic.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Byzantine Empire ====
* April 11 – Emperor Romanos III (Argyros) is drowned in his bath, at the urging of his wife Zoë, who marries her chamberlain, and elevates him to the throne of the Byzantine Empire, as Michael IV. Romanos is buried in the Church of St. Mary Peribleptos in Constantinople.

==== Europe ====
* Spring – Emperor Conrad II (the Elder) leads a German military expedition via the Rhone River into Burgundy, while two Italian armies led by Archbishop Aribert and Boniface III (margrave of Tuscany) head over the Alps and join with Count Humbert I at Great St. Bernard Pass.
* March – Conrad II converges his armies on Lake Lemano and defeats Count Odo II in battle at Geneva (modern Switzerland). For his assistance, Conrad grants Humbert I with the Burgundian county of Maurienne.
* May – King Mieszko II dies after a 6-year reign (probably killed as a result of a conspiracy) and is succeeded by his 17-year-old son Casimir I (the Restorer). A violent revolt spreads throughout Poland.
* King Sancho III (the Great) of Pamplona captures León, after defeating a string of rivals. His rule now extends from the borders of Galicia in the west to the County of Barcelona in the east.
* Summer – Poland is broken up into regions (during the so-called Pagan Reaction). Queen Richeza, Casimir I and his sisters Ryksa and Gertruda are driven into exile in Germany.

<doc id="36701" wikidata="Q865416" url="?curid=36701" title="Cloistered rule">
<text>was a form of government in Japan during the Heian period. In this bifurcated system, an emperor abdicated, but retained power and influence. Those retired emperors who withdrew to live in monasteries (&quot;in&quot;) continued to act in ways intended to counterbalance the influence of Fujiwara regents and the warrior class. Simultaneously, the titular emperor, the former emperor&#x27;s chosen successor, fulfilled all the ceremonial roles and formal duties of the monarchy.

Retired emperors were called &quot;Daijō Tennō&quot; or &quot;Jōkō&quot;. A retired emperor who entered a Buddhist monastic community became a Cloistered Emperor (&quot;Japanese&quot; 太上法皇 Daijō Hōō).

There were retired emperors, including cloistered emperors, both before and after the Heian period, but the notion of cloistered rule as a system usually refers to the practice put in place by Emperor Shirakawa in 1086 and followed by his successors until the rise of the Kamakura shogunate in 1192.

==Background==
The ritsuryō allowed retired emperors to exert some limited powers, and there are early examples such as Empress Jitō, Emperor Shōmu and Emperor Uda in the 7th, 8th and 9th centuries respectively.

By the end of the 10th century, the Hokke family of the Fujiwara clan held political power in Japan through the office of the Imperial Regent, and the emperor increasingly became little more than a figurehead. In 1068, Emperor Go-Sanjō became the first emperor in almost 200 years who was not related either by marriage or blood, or both, to the Hokke family. He exerted personal power while the Hokke family was dealing with internal conflicts between Fujiwara no Yorimichi and his brother Fujiwara no Norimichi, and was in a position to issue several laws and regulations, most notably the Enkyū Shōen Regulation Decree, thus weakening the regency. In 1072, however, he fell ill and abdicated in favor of Emperor Shirakawa. He died the following year. Although he did not have time to exert power after his abdication, Sanjō had weakened the regency and paved the way for the practice of cloistered rule.

In 1086, Emperor Shirakawa in his turn abdicated in favor of his son, Emperor Horikawa, who was four years old at the time. Shirakawa&#x27;s objective appeared to be the protection of his son from his younger brother (Horikawa&#x27;s uncle), who presented a serious threat of becoming a pretender to the throne, but after his retirement Shirakawa exerted his personal power to set the cloistered rule system in motion.

==End of the Heian period==
Separate imperial courts (&quot;In no Chō&quot; (院庁) evolved around the retired emperors, and their will was put into effect through offices known as &quot;Inzen&quot; (院宣) and &quot;In no Chō Kudashi Bumi&quot; (院庁下文). Cloistered emperors also had their own troops, the &quot;Hokumen no Bushi&quot; (北面の武士). The creation of these military units led eventually to the rise to power of the Taira clan, who used their membership of these units to gather political and economic power to themselves.

The end of the Heian period was marked by a rapid succession of cloistered emperors, to the point that there were several retired emperors living at the same time. The Hōgen Rebellion, following the death of the Emperor Toba, was an example of direct opposition between an emperor and an emperor emeritus. Finally, the end of the reign of Emperor Go-Shirakawa was marked by the Genpei War and the rise of Minamoto no Yoritomo as the first Kamakura &quot;shōgun&quot;.

=== Table ===
The succession of power in the &quot;Insei&quot; system was complex.

==During the Shogunates==

The establishment of the Kamakura shogunate is taken to mark the beginning of the Kamakura period, but the Insei system was not immediately abandoned. Though the shogunate took over the police force and ruled eastern Japan, the authority of the emperors and retired emperors remained considerable. However, when Go-Toba, a grandson of Go-Shirakawa, sought to overthrow the Kamakura shogunate, his forces were defeated in the Jōkyū War, and the shogunate then took steps to reduce the power (and the finances) of the retired emperors. Even after the Jōkyū War, the cloistered rule system continued to exist, at least formally, for another 200 years. There were movements to take authority back into the hands of the imperial court, such as the Kenmu Restoration attempted by Emperor Go-Daigo, but in general a retired emperor presided as the head of the Kyoto court, with the approval of the shogunate.

There were also a few examples of retired emperors supervising their successors much later, during the Edo period. The last person to use the title &quot;Daijō Hōō&quot; was Emperor Reigen, in 1686.

<text>Hex (also called Nash) is a two player abstract strategy board game in which players attempt to connect opposite sides of a rhombus-shaped board made of hexagonal cells. Hex was invented by mathematician and poet Piet Hein in 1942 and later rediscovered and popularized by John Nash.

It is traditionally played on an 11×11 rhombus board, although 13×13 and 19×19 boards are also popular. The board is composed of hexagons called &quot;cells&quot; or &quot;hexes&quot;. Each player is assigned a pair of opposite sides of the board, which they must try to connect by alternately placing a stone of their color onto any empty hex. Once placed, the stones are never moved or removed. A player wins when they successfully connect their sides together through a chain of adjacent stones. Draws are impossible in Hex due to the topology of the game board.

Despite the simplicity of its rules, the game has deep strategy and sharp tactics. It also has profound mathematical underpinnings related to the Brouwer fixed-point theorem, matroids and graph connectivity. The game was first published under the name Polygon in the Danish newspaper &quot;Politiken&quot; on December 26, 1942. It was later marketed as a board game in Denmark under the name Con-tac-tix, and Parker Brothers marketed a version of it in 1952 called Hex; they are no longer in production. Hex can also be played with paper and pencil on hexagonally ruled graph paper.

==Game type==
Hex is a finite, 2-player perfect information game, and an abstract strategy game that belongs to the general category of &quot;connection games&quot;. It can be classified as a Maker-Breaker game, a particular type of positional game. Since the game can never end in a draw, Hex is also a determined game.

Hex is a special case of the &quot;node&quot; version of the Shannon switching game. Hex can be played as a board game or as a paper-and-pencil game.

==Rules==
Hex is played on a rhombic grid of hexagons, typically of size 11×11, although other sizes are also possible. Each player has an allocated color, conventionally red and blue, or black and white. Each player is also assigned two opposite board edges. The hexagons on each of the four corners belong to both adjacent board edges.

The players take turns placing a stone of their color on a single cell on the board. The most common convention is for Red or Black to go first. Once placed, stones are not moved, replaced, or removed from the board. Each player&#x27;s goal is to form a connected path of their own stones linking their two board edges. The player who complete such a connection wins the game.

To compensate for the first player&#x27;s advantage, the swap rule (also called the pie rule) is normally used. This rule allows the second player to choose whether to switch positions with the first player after the first player makes the first move.

When it is clear to both players who will win the game, it is customary, but not required, for the losing player to resign. In practice, most games of Hex end with one of the players resigning.

==History==

===Invention===
The game was invented by the Danish mathematician Piet Hein, who introduced it in 1942 at the Niels Bohr Institute. Although Hein later renamed it to Con-tac-tix, it became known in Denmark under the name &quot;Polygon&quot; due to an article by Hein in the 26 December 1942 edition of the Danish newspaper &quot;Politiken&quot;, the first published description of the game, in which he used that name.

===Nash&#x27;s claim===
The game was rediscovered in 1948 or 1949 by the mathematician John Nash at Princeton University. According to Martin Gardner, who featured Hex in his July 1957 Mathematical Games column, Nash&#x27;s fellow players called the game either Nash or John, with the latter name referring to the fact that the game could be played on hexagonal bathroom tiles. Nash insisted that he discovered the game independently of Hein, but there is some doubt about this, as it is known that there were Danish people, including Aage Bohr, who played Hex at Princeton in the 1940s, so that Nash may have subconsciously picked up the idea. Hein wrote to Gardner in 1957 expressing doubt that Nash discovered Hex independently. Gardner was unable to independently verify or refute Nash&#x27;s claim. Gardner privately wrote to Hein: &quot;I discussed it with the editor, and we decided that the charitable thing to do was to give Nash the benefit of the doubt. ... The fact that you invented the game before anyone else is undisputed. Any number of people can come along later and say that they thought of the same thing at some later date, but this means little and nobody really cares.&quot; In a later letter to Hein, Gardner also wrote: &quot;Just between you and me, and off the record, I think you hit the nail on the head when you referred to a &#x27;flash of a suggestion&#x27; which came to Mr. Nash from a Danish source, and which he later forgot about. It seems the most likely explanation.&quot;

===Published games===

Initially in 1942, Hein distributed the game, which was then called Polygon, in the form of 50-sheet game pads. Each sheet contained an 11×11 empty board that could be played on with pencils or pens. In 1952, Parker Brothers marketed a version of the game under the name &quot;Hex&quot;, and the name stuck. Parker Brothers also sold a version under the &quot;Con-tac-tix&quot; name in 1968. Hex was also issued as one of the games in the 1974 3M Paper Games Series; the game contained a 50-sheet pad of ruled Hex grids. Hex is currently published by Nestorgames in a 11×11 size, a 14×14, and a 19×19 size.

===Shannon&#x27;s Hex machine===
About 1950, Claude Shannon and E. F. Moore constructed an analog Hex playing machine, which was essentially a resistance network with resistors for edges and light bulbs for vertices. The move to be made corresponded to a certain specified saddle point in the network. The machine played a reasonably good game of Hex. Later, researchers attempting to solve the game and develop Hex-playing computer algorithms emulated Shannon&#x27;s network to create strong computer players.

===Research timeline===
It was known to Hein in 1942 that Hex cannot end in a draw; in fact, one of his design criteria for the game was that &quot;exactly one of the two players can connect their two sides&quot;.

It was also known to Hein that the first player has a theoretical winning strategy.

In 1952, John Nash wrote up an existence proof that on symmetrical boards, the first player has a winning strategy.

In 1964, the mathematician Alfred Lehman showed that Hex cannot be represented as a binary matroid, so a determinate winning strategy like that for the Shannon switching game on a regular rectangular grid was unavailable. 

In 1981, the Stefan Reisch showed that Hex is PSPACE-complete.

In 2002, the first explicit winning strategy (a reduction-type strategy) on a 7×7 board was described.

In the 2000s, by using brute force search computer algorithms, Hex boards up to size 9×9 (as of 2016) have been completely solved.

Starting about 2006, the field of computer Hex came to be dominated by Monte Carlo tree search methods borrowed from successful computer implementations of Go. These replaced earlier implementations that combined Shannon&#x27;s Hex-playing heuristic with alpha-beta search. On the subject of early Computer Hex, notable early implementations include Dolphin Microware&#x27;s &quot;Hexmaster&quot;, published in the early 1980s for Atari 8-bit computers.

Until 2019, humans remained better than computers at least on big boards such as 19x19, but on Oct 30, 2019 the program Mootwo won against the human player with the best Elo rank on LittleGolem, also winner of various tournaments (the game is available here). This program was based on Polygames (an open-source project, initially developed by Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research and several universities) using a mix of:
* zero-learning as in AlphaZero
* boardsize invariance thanks to fully convolutional neural networks (as in U-Net) and pooling
* and growing architectures (the program can learn on a small board, and then extrapolate on a big board, as opposed to justified popular claims about earlier artificial intelligence methods such as the original AlphaGo).

==Strategy==
From the proof of a winning strategy for the first player, it is known that the Hex board must have a complex type of connectivity which has never been solved. Play consists of creating small patterns which have a simpler type of connectivity called &quot;safely connected&quot;, and joining them into sequences that form a &quot;path&quot;. Eventually, one of the players will succeed in forming a safely connected path of stones and spaces between their sides of the board and win. The final stage of the game, if necessary, consists of filling in the empty spaces in the path.

A &quot;safely connected&quot; pattern is composed of stones of the player&#x27;s color and open spaces which can be joined into a chain, an unbroken sequence of edge-wise adjacent stones, no matter how the opponent plays. One of the simplest such patterns is the bridge, which consists of a diamond of two stones of the same color and two empty spaces, where the two stones do not touch. If the opponent plays in either space, the player plays in the other, creating a contiguous chain. There are also safely connected patterns which connect stones to edges. There are many more safely connected patterns, some quite complex, built up of simpler ones like those shown. Patterns and paths can be disrupted by the opponent before they are complete, so the configuration of the board during an actual game often looks like a patchwork rather than something planned or designed.

There are weaker types of connectivity than &quot;safely connected&quot; which exist between stones or between safely connected patterns which have multiple spaces between them. The middle part of the game consists of creating a network of such weakly connected stones and patterns which hopefully will allow the player, by filling in the weak links, to construct just one safely connected path between sides as the game progresses.

Success at Hex requires a particular ability to visualize synthesis of complex patterns in a heuristic way, and estimating whether such patterns are &#x27;strongly enough&#x27; connected to enable an eventual win. The skill is somewhat similar to the visualization of patterns, sequencing of moves, and evaluating of positions in chess.

==Mathematical theory==
===Determinacy===
It is not difficult to convince oneself by exposition, that hex cannot end in a draw, referred to as the &quot;hex theorem&quot;. I.e., no matter how the board is filled with stones, there will always be one and only one player who has connected their edges. This fact was known to Piet Hein in 1942, who mentioned it as one of his design criteria for Hex in the original Politiken article.
Hein also stated this fact as &quot;a barrier for your opponent is a
connection for you&quot;. John Nash wrote up a proof of this fact around 1949, but apparently did not publish the proof. Its first exposition appears in an in-house technical report in 1952, in which Nash states that &quot;connection and blocking the opponent are equivalent acts&quot;. A more rigorous proof was published by John R. Pierce in his 1961 book &quot;Symbols, Signals, and Noise&quot;. In 1979, David Gale published a proof that the determinacy of Hex is equivalent to the two-dimensional Brouwer fixed-point theorem, and that the determinacy of higher-dimensional &quot;n&quot;-player variants proves the fixed-point theorem in general. 

An informal proof of the no-draw property of Hex can be sketched as follows: consider the connected component of one of the red edges. This component either includes the opposite red edge, in which case Red has a connection, or else it does not, in which case the blue stones along the boundary of the connected component form a winning path for Blue. The concept of a connected component is well-defined because in a hexagonal grid, two cells can only meet in an edge or not at all; it is not possible for cells to overlap in a single point.

===First-player win, informal existence proof===

In Hex without the swap rule on any board of size &quot;n&quot;x&quot;n&quot;, the first player has a theoretical winning strategy. This fact was mentioned by Hein in his notes for a lecture he gave in 1943: &quot;in contrast to most other games, it can be proved that the first player in theory always can win, that is, if she could see to the end of all possible lines of play&quot;. 

All known proofs of this fact are non-constructive, i.e., the proof gives no indication of what the actual winning strategy is. Here is a condensed version of a proof that is attributed to John Nash c. 1949. The proof works for a number of games including Hex, and has come to be called the strategy-stealing argument.

# Since Hex is a finite two-player game with perfect information either the first or second player has a winning strategy, or both can force a draw by Zermelo&#x27;s theorem.
# Since draws are impossible (see above), we can conclude that either the first or second player has a winning strategy.
# Let us assume that the second player has a winning strategy.
# The first player can now adopt the following strategy. They make an arbitrary move. Thereafter they play the winning second player strategy assumed above. If in playing this strategy, they are required to play on the cell where an arbitrary move was made, they make another arbitrary move. In this way they play the winning strategy with one extra piece always on the board.
# This extra piece cannot interfere with the first player&#x27;s imitation of the winning strategy, for an extra piece is never a disadvantage. Therefore, the first player can win.
# Because we have now contradicted our assumption that there is a winning strategy for the second player, we conclude that there is no winning strategy for the second player.
# Consequently, there must be a winning strategy for the first player.

===Computational complexity===
In 1976, Shimon Even and Robert Tarjan proved that determining whether a position in a game of generalized Hex played on arbitrary graphs is a winning position is PSPACE-complete.
A strengthening of this result was proved by Reisch by reducing the quantified Boolean formula problem in conjunctive normal form to Hex. This result means that there is no efficient (polynomial time in board size) algorithm to solve an arbitrary Hex position unless there is an efficient algorithm for all PSPACE problems, which is widely believed not to be the case. However, it doesn&#x27;t rule out the possibility of a simple winning strategy for the initial position (on boards of arbitrary size), or a simple winning strategy for all positions on a board of a particular size.

In 11×11 Hex, the state space complexity is approximately 2.4×1056; versus 4.6×1046 for chess. The game tree complexity is approximately 1098 versus 10123 for chess.

==Computed strategies for smaller boards==
In 2002, Jing Yang, Simon Liao and Mirek Pawlak found an explicit winning strategy for the first player on Hex boards of size 7×7 using a decomposition method with a set of reusable local patterns. They extended the method to weakly solve the center pair of topologically congruent openings on 8×8 boards in 2002 and the center opening on 9×9 boards in 2003. In 2009, Philip Henderson, Broderick Arneson and Ryan B. Hayward completed the analysis of the 8×8 board with a computer search, solving all the possible openings. In 2013, Jakub Pawlewicz and Ryan B. Hayward solved all openings for 9×9 boards, and one (the most-central) opening move on the 10×10 board.
Since Gardner first postulated in his column in Scientific American in 1957, albeit speciously, that any first play on the short diagonal is a winning play, for all solved game boards up to n=9, that has indeed been the case. In addition, for all boards except n=2 and n=4, there have been numerous additional winning first moves; the number of winning first moves generally is ≥ n²/2.

==Variants==
Other connection games with similar objectives but different structures include Shannon switching game (also known as Gale and Bridg-It) and TwixT. Both of these bear some degree of similarity to the ancient Chinese game of Go.

===Rectangular grids and paper and pencil===
The game may be played on a rectangular grid like a chess, checker or go board, by considering that spaces (intersections in the case of go) are connected in one diagonal direction but not the other. The game may be played with paper and pencil on a rectangular array of dots or graph paper in the same way by using two different colored pencils.

=== Board sizes ===
Popular dimensions other than the standard 11×11 are 13×13 and 19×19 as a result of the game&#x27;s relationship to the older game of Go. According to the book &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;, John Nash (one of the game&#x27;s inventors) advocated 14×14 as the optimal size.

=== Rex (Reverse Hex) ===
The misère variant of Hex is called &quot;Rex&quot;, in which each player tries to force their opponent to make a chain. Rex is slower than Hex since, on any empty board with equal dimensions, the losing player can delay a loss until the entire board is full. On boards with unequal dimensions, the player whose sides are further apart can win regardless of who plays first. On boards with equal dimensions, the first player can win on a board with an even number of cells per side, and the second player can win on a board with an odd number. On boards with an even number, one of the first player&#x27;s winning moves is always to place a stone in the acute corner.

===&quot;Blockbusters&quot;===
Hex had an incarnation as the question board from the television game show &quot;Blockbusters&quot;. In order to play a &quot;move&quot;, contestants had to answer a question correctly. The board had 5 alternating columns of 4 hexagons; the solo player could connect top-to-bottom in 4 moves, while the team of two could connect left-to-right in 5 moves.

===Y===
The game of Y is Hex played on a triangular grid of hexagons; the object is for either player to connect all three sides of the triangle. Y is a generalization of Hex to the extent that any position on a Hex board can be represented as an equivalent position on a larger Y board.

===Havannah===
Havannah is a game based on Hex. It too has a board space composed of hexagonal tiles, however the board is itself in the shape of a large hexagon, and a win is achieved by forming one of three patterns.

=== Projex ===
Projex is a variation of Hex played on a real projective plane, where the players have the goal of creating a noncontractible loop. Like in Hex, there are no ties, and there is no position in which both players have a winning connection.

===Dark Hex===
Dark Hex (also known as Phantom Hex) is an imperfect information version of Hex. The players are not exposed to each other&#x27;s stones at any point in the game unless they discover them first. The game is played in the presence of an umpire where each player first verifies the move if its a collision or not. Based on the continuation of this point the game has different versions.

==Competition==
As of 2016, there were tournaments reported from Brazil, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, UK and the US. One of the largest Hex competitions is organized by the International Committee of Mathematical Games in Paris, France, which is annually held since 2013. Hex is also part of the Computer Olympiad. During this competition the pie rule is used.

<text>HP-UX (from &quot;Hewlett Packard Unix&quot;) is a proprietary implementation of the Unix operating system developed by Hewlett Packard Enterprise; current versions support HPE Integrity Servers, based on Intel&#x27;s Itanium architecture. It is based on Unix System V (initially System III) and first released in 1984.

Earlier versions of HP-UX supported the HP Integral PC and HP 9000 Series 200, 300, and 400 computer systems based on the Motorola 68000 series of processors, the HP 9000 Series 500 computers based on HP&#x27;s proprietary FOCUS architecture, and later HP 9000 Series models based on HP&#x27;s PA-RISC instruction set architecture. HP-UX was the first Unix to offer access-control lists for file access permissions as an alternative to the standard Unix permissions system. HP-UX was also among the first Unix systems to include a built-in logical volume manager. 

HP has had a long partnership with Veritas Software, and uses VxFS as the primary file system. It is one of three commercial operating systems that have versions certified to The Open Group&#x27;s UNIX 03 standard (the others are macOS and AIX). Following the discontinuation of Itanium processors, HP-UX is set to reach end-of-life by December 2025.

==Characteristics==

HP-UX 11i offers a common shared disks for its clustered file system. HP Serviceguard is the cluster solution for HP-UX. HP Global Workload Management adjusts workloads to optimize performance, and integrates with Instant Capacity on Demand so installed resources can be paid for in 30-minute increments as needed for peak workload demands.

HP-UX offers operating system-level virtualization features such as hardware partitions, isolated OS virtual partitions on cell-based servers, and HP Integrity Virtual Machines (HPVM) on all Integrity servers. HPVM supports guests running on HP-UX 11i v3 hosts – guests can run Linux, Windows Server, OpenVMS or HP-UX. HP supports online VM guest migration, where encryption can secure the guest contents during migration.

HP-UX 11i v3 scales as follows (on a SuperDome 2 with 32 Intel Itanium 9560 processors):

* 256 processor cores
* 8 TB main memory
* 32 TB maximum file system
* 16 TB maximum file size
* 128 million ZB—16 million logical units each up to 8 ZB.
==Security==
The 11i v2 release introduced kernel-based intrusion detection, strong random number generation, stack buffer overflow protection, security partitioning, role-based access management, and various open-source security tools.

HP classifies the operating system&#x27;s security features into three categories: data, system and identity:

===Context dependent files===
Release 6.x (together with 3.x) introduced the context dependent files (CDF) feature, a method of allowing a fileserver to serve different configurations and binaries (and even architectures) to different client machines in a heterogeneous environment. A directory containing such files had its suid bit set and was made hidden from both ordinary and root processes under normal use. Such a scheme was sometimes exploited by intruders to hide malicious programs or data. CDFs and the CDF filesystem were dropped with release 10.0.

==Supported hardware platforms==

HP-UX operating systems supports a variety of PA-RISC systems. The 11.0 added support for Integrity-based servers for the transition from PA-RISC to Itanium. HP-UX 11i v1.5 is the first version that supported Itanium. On the introduction of HP-UX 11i v2 the operating system supported both of these architectures.

===BL series===
HP-UX 11i supports HPE Integrity Servers of HP BL server blade family. These servers use the Intel Itanium architecture.

===CX series===
HP-UX 11i v2 and 11i v3 support HP&#x27;s CX series servers. CX stands for carrier grade and is used mainly for telco industry with -48V DC support and is NEBS certified. Both of these systems contain Itanium Mad6M processors and are discontinued.

===RX series===
HP-UX supports HP&#x27;s RX series of servers.

==Release history==
Prior to the release of HP-UX version 11.11, HP used a decimal version numbering scheme with the first number giving the major release and the number following the decimal showing the minor release. With 11.11, HP made a marketing decision to name their releases 11&quot;i&quot; followed by a v(&quot;decimal-number&quot;) for the version. The &quot;i&quot; was intended to indicate the OS is Internet-enabled, but the effective result was a dual version-numbering scheme.

===Version history===


===Versions===
;1.0 (1982): First release for HP 9000 Series 500. HP-UX for Series 500 was substantially different from HP-UX for any other HP machines, as it was layered atop a Series 500 specific operating system called SUNOS (unrelated to Sun Microsystems&#x27; SunOS).
;1.0 (1984): AT&amp;T System III based. Support for the HP Integral PC (HP 9807A). The kernel runs from ROM; other commands are disk based.
;2.0 (1984): First release for HP&#x27;s early Motorola 68000-based workstations (HP 9816U, HP 9826U, HP 9836U)
;5.0 (1985): AT&amp;T System V based. Distinct versions were available for the Integral PC, the Series 200/300 and the Series 500. Introduced the proprietary &quot;Starbase&quot; graphics API for the Series 200, 300 and 500. The Series 300 5.x releases included a proprietary windowing system built on top of Starbase named &quot;HP Windows/9000&quot;, which was also available as an optional extra for Series 500 hardware.
;3.x (1988): HP 9000 Series 600/800 only. Note: 2.x/3.x (for Series 600/800) were developed in parallel with 5.x/6.x (for Series 200/300/400), so, for example, 3.x was really contemporary with 6.x. The two lines were united at HP-UX 7.x.
;6.x (1988): Support for HP 9000 Series 300 only. Introduced sockets from 4.3BSD. This version (together with 3.x) also introduced the above-discussed context dependent files (CDF), which were removed in release 10 because of their security risks. The 6.2 release added X11, superseding HP Windows/9000 and X10. 6.5 allowed Starbase programs to run alongside X11 programs.
;7.x (1990): Support for HP 9000 Series 300/400, 600/700 (in 7.03) /800 HP systems. Provided OSF/Motif. Final version to include the HP Windows/9000 windowing system.
;8.x (January 1991): Support for HP 9000 Series 300/400 600/700/800 systems. Shared libraries introduced. 
;9.x (July 1992): 9.00, 9.02, 9.04 (Series 600/800), 9.01, 9.03, 9.05, 9.07 (Series 300/400/700), 9.08, 9.09, 9.09+ (Series 700 only), 9.10 (Series 300/400 only). These provided support for the HP 9000 Series 300, 700 and 800 systems. Introduced System Administration Manager (SAM). The Logical Volume Manager (LVM) was presented in 9.00 for the Series 800. Adopted the Visual User Environment desktop. 
;10.0 (1995): This major release saw a convergence of the operating system between the HP 9000 Series 700 (workstation) and Series 800 (server) systems, dropping support for previous lines. There was also a significant change in the layout in the system files and directories, based on the AT&amp;T UNIX System V Release 4 standard. Applications were removed from /usr and moved under /opt; startup configuration files were placed under /etc/rc.config.d; users were moved to /home from /users. Software for HP-UX was now packaged, shipped, installed, and removed via the Software Distributor (SD) tools. LVM was also made available for Series 700.
;10.10 (1996): Introduced the Common Desktop Environment. UNIX95 compliance.
;10.20 (1996): This release included support for 64-bit PA-RISC 2.0 processors. Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) were introduced for use within CDE. The root file system could be configured to use the Veritas File System (VxFS). For legacy as well as technical reasons, the file system used for the boot kernel remained Hi Performance FileSystem (HFS, a variant of UFS) until version 11.23. 10.20 also supported 32-bit user and group identifiers. The prior limit was 60,000, or 16-bit. This and earlier releases of HP-UX are now effectively obsolete, and support by HP ended on June 30, 2003.
;10.24: This is a &quot;Virtual Vault&quot; release of HP-UX, providing enhanced security features. Virtual Vault is a compartmentalised operating system in which each file is assigned a compartment and processes only have access to files in the appropriate compartment and unlike most other UNIX systems the superuser (or root) does not have complete access to the system without following correct procedures.
;10.30 (1997): This was primarily a developer release with various incremental enhancements. It provided the first support for kernel threads, with a 1:1 thread model (each user thread is bound to one kernel thread).
;11.00 (1997): The first HP-UX release to also support 64-bit addressing. It could still run 32-bit applications on a 64-bit system. It supported symmetric multiprocessing, Fibre Channel, and NFS PV3. It also included tools and documentation to convert 32-bit code to 64-bit.
;11.04: &quot;Virtual Vault&quot; release.
;11.10: This was a limited release to support the HP 9000 V2500 SCA (Scalable Computing Architecture) and V2600 SCA servers. It also added JFS 3.3, AutoFS, a new ftpd, and support for up to 128 CPUs. It was not available separately.
;11.11 (2000) 11i v1: This release of HP-UX introduced the concept of Operating Environments. It was released in December 2000. These are bundled groups of layered applications intended for use with a general category of usage. The available types were the Mission Critical, Enterprise, Internet, Technical Computing, and Minimal Technical OEs. (The last two were intended for HP 9000 workstations.) The main enhancements with this release were support for hard partitions, Gigabit Ethernet, NFS over TCP/IP, loadable kernel modules, dynamic kernel tunable parameters, kernel event Notifications, and protected stacks.
;11.20 (2001) 11i v1.5: This release of HP-UX was the first to support the new line of Itanium-based (IA-64) systems. It was not intended for &quot;mission critical&quot; computing environments and did not support HP&#x27;s ServiceGuard cluster software. It provided support for running PA-RISC compiled applications on Itanium systems, and for Veritas Volume Manager 3.1.
;11.22 (2002) 11i v1.6: An incremental release of the Itanium version of HP-UX. This version achieved 64-way scalability, &quot;m:n&quot; threads, added more dynamic kernel tunable parameters, and supported HP&#x27;s Logical Volume Manager on Itanium. It was built from the 11i v1 source code stream.
;11.23 (2003) 11i v2: The original release of this version was in September 2003 to support the Itanium-based systems. In September 2004 the OS was updated to provide support for both Itanium and PA-RISC systems. Besides running on Itanium systems, this release includes support for ccNUMA, web-based kernel and device configuration, IPv6, and stronger random number generation.
;11.31 (2007) 11i v3: This release supports both PA-RISC and Itanium. It was released on February 15, 2007. Major new features include native multipathing support, a unified file cache, NFSv4, Veritas ClusterFS, multi-volume VxFS, and integrated virtualization. Hyperthreading is supported on Itanium systems with Montecito and Tukwila processors. HP-UX 11i v3 conforms to The Open Group&#x27;s UNIX 03 standard. Updates for 11i v3 have been released every 6 months, with the latest revision being B.11.31.1805, released in May 2018. HP has moved to a cadence of one major HP-UX operating system update per year.

<doc id="36712" wikidata="Q1934189" url="?curid=36712" title="Phonetic algorithm">
<text>A phonetic algorithm is an algorithm for indexing of words by their pronunciation. Most phonetic algorithms were developed for English and are not useful for indexing words in other languages. Because English spelling varies significantly depending on multiple factors, such as the word&#x27;s origin and usage over time and borrowings from other languages, phonetic algorithms necessarily take into account numerous rules and exceptions.

==Algorithms==
Among the best-known phonetic algorithms are:

* Soundex, which was developed to encode surnames for use in censuses. Soundex codes are four-character strings composed of a single letter followed by three numbers.
* Daitch–Mokotoff Soundex, which is a refinement of Soundex designed to better match surnames of Slavic and Germanic origin. Daitch–Mokotoff Soundex codes are strings composed of six numeric digits.
* Cologne phonetics: This is similar to Soundex, but more suitable for German words.
* Metaphone and Double Metaphone which are suitable for use with most English words, not just names. Metaphone algorithms are the basis for many popular spell checkers.
* New York State Identification and Intelligence System (NYSIIS), which maps similar phonemes to the same letter. The result is a string that can be pronounced by the reader without decoding.
* Match Rating Approach developed by Western Airlines in 1977 - this algorithm has an encoding and range comparison technique.
* Caverphone, created to assist in data matching between late 19th century and early 20th century electoral rolls, optimized for accents present in parts of New Zealand.

== Common uses ==
* Spell checkers can often contain phonetic algorithms. The Metaphone algorithm, for example, can take an incorrectly spelled word and create a code. The code is then looked up in directory for words with the same or similar Metaphone. Words that have the same or similar Metaphone become possible alternative spellings.
* Search functionality will often use phonetic algorithms to find results that don&#x27;t match exactly the term(s) used in the search. Searching for names can be difficult as there are often multiple alternative spellings for names. An example is the name . It has two alternatives, Clare/Clair, which are both pronounced the same. Searching for one spelling wouldn&#x27;t show results for the two others. Using Soundex all three variations produce the same Soundex code, C460. By searching names based on the Soundex code all three variations will be returned.
* Data deduplication efforts use phonetic algorithms to easily bucket records into groups of similar sounding names for further evaluation.
* Speech to text modules use phonetic encoding to find the set of dictionary words that are pronounced similarly to the phonemes output by the processed audio signal.

<doc id="36713" wikidata="Q1925103" url="?curid=36713" title="Metaphone">
<text>Metaphone is a phonetic algorithm, published by Lawrence Philips in 1990, for indexing words by their English pronunciation. It fundamentally improves on the Soundex algorithm by using information about variations and inconsistencies in English spelling and pronunciation to produce a more accurate encoding, which does a better job of matching words and names which sound similar. As with Soundex, similar-sounding words should share the same keys. Metaphone is available as a built-in operator in a number of systems.

Philips later produced a new version of the algorithm, which he named Double Metaphone. Contrary to the original algorithm whose application is limited to English only, this version takes into account spelling peculiarities of a number of other languages. In 2009 Philips released a third version, called Metaphone 3, which achieves an accuracy of approximately 99% for English words, non-English words familiar to Americans, and first names and family names commonly found in the United States, having been developed according to modern engineering standards against a test harness of prepared correct encodings.

==Procedure==
Original Metaphone codes use the 16 consonant symbols 0BFHJKLMNPRSTWXY. The &#x27;0&#x27; represents &quot;th&quot; (as an ASCII approximation of Θ), &#x27;X&#x27; represents &quot;sh&quot; or &quot;ch&quot;, and the others represent their usual English pronunciations. The vowels AEIOU are also used, but only at the beginning of the code. This table summarizes most of the rules in the original implementation:

# Drop duplicate adjacent letters, except for C.
# If the word begins with &#x27;KN&#x27;, &#x27;GN&#x27;, &#x27;PN&#x27;, &#x27;AE&#x27;, &#x27;WR&#x27;, drop the first letter.
# Drop &#x27;B&#x27; if after &#x27;M&#x27; at the end of the word.
# &#x27;C&#x27; transforms to &#x27;X&#x27; if followed by &#x27;IA&#x27; or &#x27;H&#x27; (unless in latter case, it is part of &#x27;-SCH-&#x27;, in which case it transforms to &#x27;K&#x27;). &#x27;C&#x27; transforms to &#x27;S&#x27; if followed by &#x27;I&#x27;, &#x27;E&#x27;, or &#x27;Y&#x27;. Otherwise, &#x27;C&#x27; transforms to &#x27;K&#x27;.
# &#x27;D&#x27; transforms to &#x27;J&#x27; if followed by &#x27;GE&#x27;, &#x27;GY&#x27;, or &#x27;GI&#x27;. Otherwise, &#x27;D&#x27; transforms to &#x27;T&#x27;.
# Drop &#x27;G&#x27; if followed by &#x27;H&#x27; and &#x27;H&#x27; is not at the end or before a vowel. Drop &#x27;G&#x27; if followed by &#x27;N&#x27; or &#x27;NED&#x27; and is at the end.
# &#x27;G&#x27; transforms to &#x27;J&#x27; if before &#x27;I&#x27;, &#x27;E&#x27;, or &#x27;Y&#x27;, and it is not in &#x27;GG&#x27;. Otherwise, &#x27;G&#x27; transforms to &#x27;K&#x27;.
# Drop &#x27;H&#x27; if after vowel and not before a vowel.
# &#x27;CK&#x27; transforms to &#x27;K&#x27;.
# &#x27;PH&#x27; transforms to &#x27;F&#x27;.
# &#x27;Q&#x27; transforms to &#x27;K&#x27;.
# &#x27;S&#x27; transforms to &#x27;X&#x27; if followed by &#x27;H&#x27;, &#x27;IO&#x27;, or &#x27;IA&#x27;.
# &#x27;T&#x27; transforms to &#x27;X&#x27; if followed by &#x27;IA&#x27; or &#x27;IO&#x27;. &#x27;TH&#x27; transforms to &#x27;0&#x27;. Drop &#x27;T&#x27; if followed by &#x27;CH&#x27;.
# &#x27;V&#x27; transforms to &#x27;F&#x27;.
# &#x27;WH&#x27; transforms to &#x27;W&#x27; if at the beginning. Drop &#x27;W&#x27; if not followed by a vowel.
# &#x27;X&#x27; transforms to &#x27;S&#x27; if at the beginning. Otherwise, &#x27;X&#x27; transforms to &#x27;KS&#x27;.
# Drop &#x27;Y&#x27; if not followed by a vowel.
# &#x27;Z&#x27; transforms to &#x27;S&#x27;.
# Drop all vowels unless it is the beginning.

This table does not constitute a complete description of the original Metaphone algorithm, and the algorithm cannot be coded correctly from it. Original Metaphone contained many errors and was superseded by Double Metaphone, and in turn Double Metaphone and original Metaphone were superseded by Metaphone 3, which corrects thousands of miscodings that will be produced by the first two versions.

To implement Metaphone without purchasing a (source code) copy of Metaphone 3, the reference implementation of Double Metaphone can be used. Alternatively, version 2.1.3 of Metaphone 3, an earlier 2009 version without a number of encoding corrections made in the current version, version 2.5.4, has been made available under the terms of the BSD License via the OpenRefine project.

== Double Metaphone ==
The Double Metaphone phonetic encoding algorithm is the second generation of this algorithm. Its implementation was described in the June 2000 issue of &quot;C/C++ Users Journal&quot;. It makes a number of fundamental design improvements over the original Metaphone algorithm.

It is called &quot;Double&quot; because it can return both a primary and a secondary code for a string; this accounts for some ambiguous cases as well as for multiple variants of surnames with common ancestry. For example, encoding the name &quot;Smith&quot; yields a primary code of &quot;SM0&quot; and a secondary code of &quot;XMT&quot;, while the name &quot;Schmidt&quot; yields a primary code of &quot;XMT&quot; and a secondary code of &quot;SMT&quot;—both have &quot;XMT&quot; in common.

Double Metaphone tries to account for myriad irregularities in English of Slavic, Germanic, Celtic, Greek, French, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, and other origins. Thus it uses a much more complex ruleset for coding than its predecessor; for example, it tests for approximately 100 different contexts of the use of the letter C alone.

==Metaphone 3==
A professional version was released in October 2009, developed by the same author, Lawrence Philips. It is a commercial product sold as source code. Metaphone 3 further improves phonetic encoding of words in the English language, non-English words familiar to Americans, and first names and family names commonly found in the United States. It improves encoding for proper names in particular to a considerable extent. The author claims that in general it improves accuracy for all words from the approximately 89% of Double Metaphone to 98%. Developers can also now set switches in code to cause the algorithm to encode Metaphone keys 1) taking non-initial vowels into account, as well as 2) encoding voiced and unvoiced consonants differently. This allows the result set to be more closely focused if the developer finds that the search results include too many words that don&#x27;t resemble the search term closely enough. Metaphone 3 is sold as C++, Java, C#, PHP, Perl, and PL/SQL source, Ruby and Python wrappers accessing a Java jar, and also Metaphone 3 for Spanish and German pronunciation available as Java and C# source. The latest revision of the Metaphone 3 algorithm is v2.5.4, released March 2015. The Metaphone3 Java source code for an earlier version, 2.1.3, lacking a large number of encoding corrections made in the current version, version 2.5.4, was included as part of the OpenRefine project and is publicly viewable.

== Common misconceptions ==
There are some misconceptions about the Metaphone algorithms that should be addressed. The following statements are true:

# All of them are designed to address regular, &quot;dictionary&quot; words, not just names, and 
# Metaphone algorithms do not produce phonetic representations of the input words and names; rather, the output is an intentionally approximate phonetic representation, according to this standard: 
::* words that start with a vowel sound will have an &#x27;A&#x27;, representing any vowel, as the first character of the encoding (in Double Metaphone and Metaphone 3 - original Metaphone just preserves the actual vowel), 
::* vowels after an initial vowel sound will be disregarded and not encoded, and 
::* voiced/unvoiced consonant pairs will be mapped to the same encoding. (Examples of voiced/unvoiced consonant pairs are D/T, B/P, Z/S, G/K, etc.).

This approximate encoding is necessary to account for the way English speakers vary their pronunciations and misspell or otherwise vary words and names they are trying to spell. Vowels, of course, are notoriously highly variable. British speakers often complain that Americans seem to pronounce &#x27;T&#x27;s the same as &#x27;D&#x27;. Consider, also, that all English speakers often pronounce &#x27;Z&#x27; where &#x27;S&#x27; is spelled, almost always when a noun ending in a voiced consonant or a liquid is pluralized, for example &quot;seasons&quot;, &quot;beams&quot;, &quot;examples&quot;, etc. Not encoding vowels after an initial vowel sound will help to group words where a vowel and a consonant may be transposed in the misspelling or alternative pronunciation.

== Metaphone of other languages ==
Metaphone is useful for English variants and other languages, having been preferred to Soundex in several Indo-European languages. On the other hand, rough phonetic encoding causes language dependency — or, in a language variant, average language-speaker dependency — mainly for non-English variants.

Perhaps the first example of stable adaptation of non-English metaphone was Brazilian Portuguese: it originated in ~2008 as a database solution in Várzea Paulista municipality of Brazil, and it evolved to the current codice_1 algorithm.

<text>Audio Video Interleave (also Audio Video Interleaved and known by its initials and filename extension AVI, usually pronounced ) is a proprietary multimedia container format and Windows standard introduced by Microsoft in November 1992 as part of its Video for Windows software. AVI files can contain both audio and video data in a file container that allows synchronous audio-with-video playback. Like the DVD video format, AVI files support multiple streaming audio and video, although these features are seldom used.

Many AVI files use the file format extensions developed by the Matrox OpenDML group in February 1996. These files are supported by Microsoft, and are unofficially called AVI 2.0. In 2010 the US government&#x27;s National Archives and Records Administration defined AVI as the official wrapper for preserving digital video.

==History==
Publishers faced a predicament regarding how they should distribute videos on CD-ROMs. Thirty seconds of video displayed in 24-bit color and at thirty frames per second and Super VGA resolutions could take up 680 megabytes of space—the storage capacity of most CD-ROMs in 1992. Lossily compressing the videos would save a lot of space, but not without degrading the quality of the videos. Publishers who were more concerned about video quality instead were searching for an ideal compression algorithm that would compress the video files while still preserving the quality.

Microsoft recognized the problem and sought to develop a standard that would losslessly compress the video files. They also recognized that because of the hardware requirements for playing the videos in uncompressed quality, which at the time were demanding, it needed to allow users of low-end computers to play the videos in compressed quality. They developed and published the Audio Video Interleave format on November 10, 1992, as part of their Video for Windows, and included support for codecs to satisfy those users.

==Format==
AVI is a subformat of the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF), which divides a file&#x27;s data into blocks, or &quot;chunks&quot;. Each chunk is identified by a FourCC tag.

An AVI file takes the form of a RIFF header, which is then divided into two mandatory chunks and one optional chunk. The first chunk is identified by the &quot;hdrl&quot; tag, which stores the information required by the codec to decompress the AVI file for viewing. The second sub-chunk is identified by the &quot;movi&quot; tag, containing the actual audio and visual data that make up the AVI video. The third optional chunk is identified by the &quot;idx1&quot; tag, which indexes the offsets of the data chunks within the file.

By way of the RIFF format, the audio and visual data contained in the &quot;movi&quot; chunk can be encoded or decoded by software called a codec, which is an abbreviation for (en)coder/decoder. Upon creation of the file, the codec translates between raw data and the (compressed) data format used inside the chunk. An AVI file may carry audio and visual data inside the chunks in virtually any compression scheme, including Full Frame (Uncompressed), Indeo, run-length encoding, and Microsoft Video 1.

Some programs, like VLC, complain when the &quot;idx1&quot; index sub-chunk is not found, as it is required for efficient moving among timestamps. They offer to &quot;fix&quot; the file by building an index temporarily or permanently.

==Metadata==
As a derivative of the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF), AVI files are commonly tagged with metadata in the INFO chunk. In addition, AVI files can embed Extensible Metadata Platform. By design, any RIFF file can legally include additional chunks of data, each identified by a four-character code; software which does not understand that particular code should skip the chunk. As such, it is theoretically possible to expand any RIFF file format, including AVI, to support almost any conceivable metadata. Some of the limitations of AVI in modern use relate to a lack of standardization in this metadata (see Limitations below).

==Limitations==
Since its introduction in the early 90s, new computer video techniques have been introduced which the original AVI specification did not anticipate.

* The original AVI specification does not provide a standardized way to encode aspect ratio information, although the later OpenDML (AVI 2.0) specification does. Consequently, older players may not select the right aspect ratio automatically (though it may be possible to do so manually).
*There are several competing approaches to including a time code in AVI files, which affects usability of the format in film and television post-production, although it is widely used. For WAV audio files, Broadcast Wave (BWF) extensions were designed to standardize post-production metadata, but an equivalent for AVI files has not emerged. Some parties are known to write BWF chunks into AVI for metadata.
* AVI was not intended to contain video using any compression technique that requires access to future video frame data beyond the current frame (B-frame). Approaches exist to support modern video compression techniques (such as MPEG-4) that rely on this function, although this is beyond the intent of the original specification and may cause problems with playback software which does not anticipate this use.
*AVI cannot contain some specific types of variable bitrate (VBR) data reliably (such as MP3 audio at sample rates below 32 kHz).
*Overhead for AVI files at the resolutions and frame rates normally used to encode standard definition feature films is about 5 MB per hour of video, the significance of which varies with the application.
* AVI files cannot contain attachments such as fonts and subtitles. Consequently, subtitles must be distributed in a separate file or hardcoded into the video stream.

More recent container formats (such as Matroska, Ogg and MP4) solve all these problems, although software is freely available to both create and correctly replay AVI files which use the techniques described here.

==DV AVI==

DV AVI is a type of AVI file where the video has been compressed to conform with DV standards. There are two types of DV-AVI files:
* Type 1: The multiplexed Audio-Video is kept in its original multiplexing and saved together into the Video section of the AVI file
** Does not waste much space (audio is saved uncompressed, but even uncompressed audio is tiny compared to the video part of DV), but Windows applications based on the VfW API do not support it.
* Type 2: Like type 1, but audio is also saved as an additional audio stream into the file.
** Supported by VfW applications, at the price of a small increase in file size.

Type 1 is actually the newer of the two types. Microsoft made the &quot;type&quot; designations, and decided to name their older VfW-compatible version &quot;Type 2&quot;, which only furthered confusion about the two types. In the late 1990s through early 2000s, most professional-level DV software, including non-linear editing programs, only supported Type 1. One notable exception was Adobe Premiere, which only supported Type 2. High-end FireWire controllers usually captured to Type 1 only, while &quot;consumer&quot; level controllers usually captured to Type 2 only. Software is and was available for converting Type 1 AVIs to Type 2, and vice versa, but this is a time-consuming process.

Many FireWire controllers only captured to one or the other type. However, almost all relevant software supports both Type 1 and Type 2 editing and rendering, including Adobe Premiere. Thus, many users are unaware of the fact that there are two types of DV AVI files.

<text>The &quot;Buran&quot; programme (, , &quot;Snowstorm&quot;, &quot;Blizzard&quot;), also known as the &quot;VKK Space Orbiter programme&quot; (), was a Soviet and later Russian reusable spacecraft project that began in 1974 at the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute in Moscow and was formally suspended in 1993. In addition to being the designation for the whole Soviet/Russian reusable spacecraft project, &quot;Buran&quot; was also the name given to orbiter 1K, which completed one uncrewed spaceflight in 1988 and was the only Soviet reusable spacecraft to be launched into space. The Buran-class orbiters used the expendable Energia rocket as a launch vehicle.

The Buran programme was started by the Soviet Union as a response to the United States Space Shuttle program and benefited from extensive espionage undertaken by the KGB of the unclassified US Space Shuttle program, resulting in many superficial and functional similarities between American and Soviet Shuttle designs. Although the Buran class was similar in appearance to NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle orbiter, and could similarly operate as a re-entry spaceplane, its final internal and functional design was different. For example, the main engines during launch were on the Energia rocket and were not taken into orbit by the spacecraft. Smaller rocket engines on the craft&#x27;s body provided propulsion in orbit and de-orbital burns, similar to the Space Shuttle&#x27;s OMS pods. Unlike the Space Shuttle whose first orbital spaceflight was accomplished in April 1981, Buran, whose first and only spaceflight occurred in November 1988, had a capability of flying uncrewed missions, as well as performing fully automated landings. The project was the largest and the most expensive in the history of Soviet space exploration.

== Background ==
The Soviet reusable spacecraft programme has its roots in the late 1950s, at the very beginning of the space age. The idea of Soviet reusable space flight is very old, though it was neither continuous nor consistently organized. Before Buran, no project of the programme reached operational status.

The first step toward a reusable Soviet spacecraft was the 1954 Burya, a high-altitude prototype jet aircraft/cruise missile. Several test flights were made before it was cancelled by order of the Central Committee. The Burya had the goal of delivering a nuclear payload, presumably to the United States, and then returning to base. The Burya programme was cancelled by the USSR in favor of a decision to develop ICBMs instead. The next iteration of a reusable spacecraft was the Zvezda design, which also reached a prototype stage. Decades later, another project with the same name would be used as a service module for the International Space Station. After Zvezda, there was a hiatus in reusable projects until Buran.

The Buran orbital vehicle programme was developed in response to the U.S. Space Shuttle program, which raised considerable concerns among the Soviet military and especially Defense Minister Dmitry Ustinov. An authoritative chronicler of the Soviet and later Russian space programme, the academic Boris Chertok, recounts how the programme came into being. According to Chertok, after the U.S. developed its Space Shuttle program, the Soviet military became suspicious that it could be used for military purposes, due to its enormous payload, several times that of previous U.S. launch vehicles. Officially, the Buran orbital vehicle was designed for the delivery to orbit and return to Earth of spacecraft, cosmonauts, and supplies. Both Chertok and Gleb Lozino-Lozinskiy (General Designer and General Director of NPO Molniya) suggest that from the beginning, the programme was military in nature; however, the exact military capabilities, or intended capabilities, of the Buran programme remain classified.

Like its American counterpart, the Buran orbital vehicle, when in transit from its landing sites back to the launch complex, was transported on the back of a large jet aeroplane – the Antonov An-225 Mriya transport aircraft, which was designed in part for this task and was the largest aircraft in the world to fly multiple times. Before the &quot;Mriya&quot; was ready (after the Buran had flown), the Myasishchev VM-T &quot;Atlant&quot;, a variant on the Soviet Myasishchev M-4 &quot;Molot&quot; (Hammer) bomber (NATO code: Bison), fulfilled the same role.

== History of the Buran programme ==
=== Programme development ===
The development of the Buran began in the early 1970s as a response to the U.S. Space Shuttle program. Soviet officials were concerned about a perceived military threat posed by the U.S. Space Shuttle. In their opinion, the Shuttle&#x27;s 30-ton payload-to-orbit capacity and, more significantly, its 15-ton payload return capacity, were a clear indication that one of its main objectives would be to place massive experimental laser weapons into orbit that could destroy enemy missiles from a distance of several thousands of kilometres. Their reasoning was that such weapons could only be effectively tested in actual space conditions and that to cut their development time and save costs it would be necessary to regularly bring them back to Earth for modifications and fine-tuning. Soviet officials were also concerned that the U.S. Space Shuttle could make a sudden dive into the atmosphere to drop nuclear bombs on Moscow.

In 1974, Valentin Glushko&#x27;s design bureau, OKB-1 (later NPO Energiya), proposed a new family of heavy-lift rockets called RLA (). The RLA concept included the use of kerosene and liquid hydrogen as fuel, and liquid oxygen as oxidizer (both new technologies in the Soviet space programme), with the shuttle orbiter being one possible payload. While NPO Molniya conducted development under the lead of Gleb Lozino-Lozinskiy, the Soviet Union&#x27;s Military-Industrial Commission, or VPK, was tasked with collecting all data it could on the U.S. Space Shuttle. Under the auspices of the KGB, the VPK was able to amass documentation on the American shuttle&#x27;s airframe designs, design analysis software, materials, flight computer systems and propulsion systems. The KGB targeted many university research project documents and databases, including Caltech, MIT, Princeton, Stanford and others. The thoroughness of the acquisition of data was made much easier as the U.S. shuttle development was unclassified.

By 1975, NPO Energiya had come up with two competing designs for the orbiter vehicle: the MTKVP (), a 34-meter-long lifting body spaceplane launched on top of a stack of kerosene-fueled strap on boosters; and the OS-120 (), a close copy of the US Space Shuttle based on US Space Shuttle documentation and designs obtained through the VPK and KGB. The OS-120 was a delta-winged spaceplane based heavily on the US Space Shuttle design, equipped with three liquid hydrogen engines, strapped to a detachable external tank and four liquid fuel boosters (NPO Energiya even considered the use of solid propellant rocket boosters, further imitating the US Shuttle&#x27;s configuration).

A compromise between these two proposals was achieved by NPO Energiya in January 1976 with the OK-92 (), a delta-winged orbiter equipped with two Soloviev D-30 turbofan jet engines for autonomous atmospheric flight, launched to space from a rocket stack made of a core stage with three cryogenic engines, and four kerosene-fueled boosters, each with four engines. By 1978, the OK-92 design was further refined, with its final configuration completed in June 1979.

Soviet engineers were initially reluctant to implement a spacecraft design with so many similarities to the US Space Shuttle. Although it has been commented that wind tunnel testing showed that NASA&#x27;s design was already ideal, the shape requirements were mandated by its potential military capabilities to transport large payloads to low Earth orbit, themselves a counterpart to the Pentagon&#x27;s initially projected missions for the Shuttle. Even though the Molniya Scientific Production Association proposed its Spiral programme design (halted 13 years earlier), it was rejected as being altogether dissimilar from the American shuttle design.

The construction of the shuttles began in 1980, and by 1984 the first full-scale Buran was rolled out. The first suborbital test flight of a scale-model (BOR-5) took place as early as July 1983. As the project progressed, five additional scale-model flights were performed. A test vehicle was constructed with four jet engines mounted at the rear; this vehicle is usually referred to as OK-GLI, or as the &quot;Buran aerodynamic analogue&quot;. The jets were used to take off from a normal landing strip, and once it reached a designated point, the engines were cut and OK-GLI glided back to land. This provided invaluable information about the handling characteristics of the Buran design, and significantly differed from the carrier plane/air drop method used by the United States and the test craft. Twenty-four test flights of OK-GLI were performed by the Gromov Flight Research Institute test pilots and researchers after which the shuttle was &quot;worn out&quot;. The developers considered using a couple of Mil Mi-26 helicopters to &quot;bundle&quot; lift the Buran, but test flights with a mock-up showed how risky and impractical that was. The VM-T ferried components and the Antonov An-225 Mriya (the heaviest airplane ever) was designed and used to ferry the shuttle.

The flight and ground-testing software also required research. In 1983 the Buran developers estimated that the software development would require several thousand programmers if done with their existing methodology (in assembly language), and they appealed to Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics for assistance. It was decided to develop a new high-level &quot;problem-oriented&quot; programming language. Researchers at Keldysh developed two languages: PROL2 (used for real-time programming of onboard systems) and DIPOL (used for the ground-based test systems), as well as the development and debugging environment SAPO PROLOGUE. There was also an operating system known as Prolog Manager. Work on these languages continued beyond the end of the Buran programme, with PROL2 being extended into SIPROL, and eventually all three languages developed into DRAKON which is still in use in the Russian space industry. A declassified May 1990 CIA report citing open-source intelligence material states that the software for the Buran spacecraft was written in &quot;the French-developed programming language known as Prolog&quot;, possibly due to confusion with the name PROLOGUE.

=== Flight crew preparation ===
Until the end of the Soviet Union in 1991, seven cosmonauts were allocated to the Buran programme and trained on the OK-GLI (&quot;Buran aerodynamic analogue&quot;) test vehicle. All had experience as test pilots. They were: Ivan Ivanovich Bachurin, Alexei Sergeyevich Borodai, Anatoli Semyonovich Levchenko, Aleksandr Vladimirovich Shchukin, Rimantas Antanas Stankevičius, Igor Petrovich Volk, and Viktor Vasiliyevich Zabolotsky.

A rule, set in place for cosmonauts after the failed Soyuz 25 mission of 1977, stipulated that all Soviet space missions must contain at least one crew member who has been to space before. In 1982, it was decided that all Buran commanders and their back-ups would occupy the third seat on a Soyuz mission, prior to their Buran spaceflight. Several people had been selected to potentially be in the first Buran crew. By 1985, it was decided that at least one of the two crew members would be a test pilot trained at the Gromov Flight Research Institute (known as &quot;LII&quot;), and potential crew lists were drawn up. Only two potential Buran crew members reached space: Igor Volk, who flew in Soyuz T-12 to the space station Salyut 7, and Anatoli Levchenko who visited Mir, launching with Soyuz TM-4 and landing with Soyuz TM-3. Both of these spaceflights lasted about a week.

Levchenko died of a brain tumour the year after his orbital flight, Bachurin left the cosmonaut corps because of medical reasons, Shchukin was assigned to the back-up crew of Soyuz TM-4 and later died in a plane crash, Stankevičius was also killed in a plane crash, while Borodai and Zabolotsky remained unassigned to a Soyuz flight until the Buran programme ended.

==== Spaceflight of I. P. Volk ====

Igor Volk was planned to be the commander of the first crewed Buran flight. There were two purposes of the Soyuz T-12 mission, one of which was to give Volk spaceflight experience. The other purpose, seen as the more important factor, was to beat the United States and have the first spacewalk by a woman. At the time of the Soyuz T-12 mission the Buran programme was still a state secret. The appearance of Volk as a crew member caused some, including the British Interplanetary Society magazine &quot;Spaceflight&quot;, to ask why a test pilot was occupying a Soyuz seat usually reserved for researchers or foreign cosmonauts.

==== Spaceflight of A. S. Levchenko ====

Anatoli Levchenko was planned to be the back-up commander of the first crewed Buran flight, and in March 1987 he began extensive training for his Soyuz spaceflight. In December 1987, he occupied the third seat aboard Soyuz TM-4 to Mir, and returned to Earth about a week later on Soyuz TM-3. His mission is sometimes called &quot;Mir LII-1&quot;, after the Gromov Flight Research Institute shorthand. When Levchenko died the following year, it left the back-up crew of the first Buran mission again without spaceflight experience. A Soyuz spaceflight for another potential back-up commander was sought by the Gromov Flight Research Institute, but never occurred.

=== Ground facilities ===

Maintenance, launches and landings of the Buran-class orbiters were to take place at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in the Kazakh SSR. Several facilities at Baikonur were adapted or newly built for these purposes:

* Site 110 – Used for the launch of the Buran-class orbiters. Like the assembly and processing hall at Site 112, the launch complex was originally constructed for the Soviet lunar landing program and later converted for the Energia-Buran program.
* Site 112 – Used for orbiter maintenance and to mate the orbiters to their Energia launchers (thus fulfilling a role similar to the VAB at KSC). The main hangar at the site, called &quot;MIK RN&quot; or &quot;MIK 112&quot;, was originally built for the assembly of the N1 Moon rocket. After cancellation of the N-1 programme in 1974, the facilities at Site 112 were converted for the Energia-Buran programme. It was here that orbiter 1K was stored after the end of the Buran programme and was destroyed when the hangar roof collapsed in 2002.
* Site 251 – Used as Buran orbiter landing facility, also known as &quot;Yubileyniy Airfield&quot; (and fulfilling a role similar to the SLF at KSC). It features one runway, called 06/24, which is long and wide, paved with &quot;Grade 600&quot; high quality reinforced concrete. At the edge of the runway was a special mating-demating device, designed to lift an orbiter off its Antonov An-225 Mriya carrier aircraft and load it on a transporter, which would carry the orbiter to the processing building at Site 254. A purpose-built orbiter landing control facility, housed in a large multi-storey office building, was located near the runway. &quot;Yubileyniy Airfield&quot; was also used to receive heavy transport planes carrying elements of the Energia-Buran system. After the end of the Buran programme, Site 251 was abandoned but later reopened as a commercial cargo airport. Besides serving Baikonur, Kazakh authorities also use it for passenger and charter flights from Russia.
* Site 254 – Built to service the Buran-class orbiters between flights (thus fulfilling a role similar to the OPF at KSC). Constructed in the 1980s as a special four-bay building, it also featured a large processing area flanked by several floors of test rooms. After cancellation of the Buran programme it was adapted for pre-launch operations of the Soyuz and Progress spacecraft.

=== Missions ===
==== Atmospheric test flights ====

An aerodynamic testbed, OK-GLI, was constructed in 1984 to test the in-flight properties of the Buran design. Unlike the American prototype , OK-GLI had four AL-31 turbofan engines fitted, meaning it was able to fly under its own power.

==== Orbital flight of &quot;Buran&quot; in 1988 ====

Following a series of atmospheric test flights using the jet-powered OK-GLI prototype, the first operational spacecraft (&quot;Buran&quot;, orbiter 1K) flew one uncrewed test mission.

At 03:00 UTC on 15 November 1988, &quot;Buran&quot; and the Energia carrier rocket lifted off from pad 110/37 in Baikonur. The life support system was not installed for the flight and no data was displayed on the CRT displays in the Command Compartment.

The shuttle orbited the Earth twice, travelling in 3 hours and 25 minutes (0.14 flight days). On its return, it performed an automated landing on the shuttle runway (Site 251) at Baikonur Cosmodrome.

==== Planned flights ====

The planned flights for the shuttles in 1989, before the downsizing of the project and eventual cancellation, were:
* 1991 — Orbiter 2K uncrewed first flight, duration 1–2 days.
* 1992 — Orbiter 2K uncrewed second flight, duration 7–8 days. Orbital manoeuvres and space station approach test.
* 1993 — &quot;Buran&quot; (1K) uncrewed second flight, duration 15–20 days.
* 1994 — Orbiter 3K first crewed space test flight, duration of 24 hours. Craft equipped with life-support system and with two ejection seats. Crew would consist of two cosmonauts with Igor Volk as commander, and a flight engineer.
* 1994-1995 - Second, third, fourth and fifth crewed orbital test flights.

The planned uncrewed second flight of orbiter 2K was changed in 1991 to the following:
* December 1991 — Orbiter 2K uncrewed second flight, with a duration of 7–8 days. Orbital maneuvers and space station approach test: 
** automatic docking with Mir&#x27;s Kristall module
** crew transfer from Mir to the orbiter, with testing of some of its systems in the course of twenty-four hours, including the remote manipulator
** undocking and autonomous flight in orbit
** docking of the crewed Soyuz TM-101 with orbiter 2K
** crew transfer from the Soyuz to the orbiter and onboard work in the course of twenty-four hours
** automatic undocking and landing

=== Cancellation of the programme 1993 ===

After the first flight of a Buran shuttle, the project was suspended due to lack of funds and the political situation in the Soviet Union. The two subsequent orbiters, which were due in 1990 (Orbiter 2K) and 1992 (Orbiter 3K) were never completed with other articles being scrapped (see next section).

The project was officially terminated on 30 June 1993, by President Boris Yeltsin. At the time of its cancellation, 20 billion roubles had been spent on the Buran programme. Commenting on the discontinuation of the programme in his interview to &quot;New Scientist&quot;, Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kotov described the project&#x27;s end:

The programme was designed to boost national pride, carry out research, and meet technological objectives similar to those of the U.S. Space Shuttle program, including resupply of the Mir space station, which was launched in 1986 and remained in service until 2001. When Mir was finally visited by a spaceplane, the visitor was a Space Shuttle orbiter, not a Buran-class orbiter.

The Buran SO, a docking module that was to be used for rendezvous with the Mir space station, was refitted for use with the U.S. Space Shuttles during the Shuttle–Mir missions.

The cost of a Buran launch carrying a 20-ton payload was estimated at 270 million roubles, vs 5.5 million roubles on the Proton rocket.

==== Baikonur hangar collapse ====
On 12 May 2002, a hangar roof at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan collapsed because of a structural failure due to poor maintenance. The collapse killed eight workers and destroyed one of the Buran-class orbiters (&quot;Buran&quot;, orbiter 1K), which flew the test flight in 1988, as well as a mock-up of an Energia booster rocket. It was not clear to outsiders at the time which orbiter was destroyed and the BBC reported that it was just &quot;a model&quot; of the orbiter. It occurred at the &quot;MIK RN/MIK 112&quot; building at Site 112 of the Baikonur Cosmodrome, 14 years after the only Buran flight. Work on the roof had begun for a maintenance project, whose equipment is thought to have contributed to the collapse, together with heavy rainfall in the days preceding the collapse.

== List of vehicles ==
Five orbiters were planned to be built (designated 1K-5K, K stands for ), with hull numbering starting with 1 or 2 (e.g. 1.01), two originally ordered in 1970s and three (&quot;second series&quot;) additionally ordered in 1983.

For research and testing purposes, several test articles were produced, designated 1M-8M (M stands for ), with hull numbering starting with 0 (e.g. 0.02). The programme prefix OK stands for and carries the GRAU index number 11F35.

By 1991 two operational vehicles were delivered to Baikonur, three others were under construction at the Tushino Machine-Building Plant (TMZ) near Moscow.

Most of the geo-locations below show the orbiter bodies on the ground; in some cases Google Earth&#x27;s History facility is required to see the orbiter within the dates specified.

== Revival possibilities ==
Over time, several scientists looked into trying to revive the Buran programme, especially after the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster.

The 2003 grounding of the U.S. Space Shuttles caused many to wonder whether the Energia launcher or Buran shuttle could be brought back into service. By then, however, all of the equipment for both (including the vehicles themselves) had fallen into disrepair or been repurposed after falling into disuse with the collapse of the Soviet Union.

In 2010 the director of Moscow&#x27;s Central Machine Building Institute said the Buran programme would be reviewed in the hope of restarting a similar crewed spacecraft design, with rocket test launches as soon as 2015. Russia also continues work on the PPTS but has abandoned the Kliper program, due to differences in vision with its European partners.

Due to the 2011 retirement of the American Space Shuttle and the need for STS-type craft in the meantime to complete the International Space Station, some American and Russian scientists had been mulling over plans to possibly revive the already-existing Buran shuttles in the Buran programme rather than spend money on an entirely new craft and wait for it to be fully developed but the plans did not come to fruition.

On the 25th anniversary of the Buran flight in November 2013, Oleg Ostapenko, the new head of Roscosmos, the Russian Federal Space Agency, proposed that a new heavy-lift launch vehicle be built for the Russian space programme. The rocket would be intended to place a payload of in a baseline low Earth orbit and is projected to be based on the Angara launch vehicle technology.

=== Comparison to NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle ===
Because Buran debut followed that of , and because there were striking visual similarities between the two shuttle systems—a state of affairs which recalled the similarity between the Tupolev Tu-144 and Concorde supersonic airliners—many speculated that Cold War espionage played a role in the development of the Soviet shuttle. Despite remarkable external similarities, many key differences existed, which suggests that, had espionage been a factor in Buran development, it would likely have been in the form of external photography or early airframe designs. NASA Administrator James C. Fletcher stated that Buran was based on a rejected NASA design. See the section above.

=== Key differences between Energia-Buran system and NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle ===
* Unlike the Space Shuttle&#x27;s boosters, each of Energia&#x27;s four boosters had their own guidance, navigation, and control system. Known as Zenit-2, they were used as launch vehicles on their own to deliver smaller payloads than those requiring the complete Energia-Buran system. Space Shuttle boosters each had their own guidance and control system, but all navigation functions were centrally located in the shuttle orbiter; the autonomous guidance functions of the boosters were therefore more limited, primarily oriented to safe separation from the external tank and orbiter during staging after booster fuel exhaustion.
* Energia could be configured with four, two or no boosters for payloads other than Buran, and in full configuration was able to put up to 100 metric tons into orbit. The Space Shuttle orbiter was integral to its launch system and was the system&#x27;s only payload.
* Energia&#x27;s four boosters used liquid propellant (kerosene/oxygen). The Space Shuttle&#x27;s two boosters used solid propellant.
* The liquid fueled booster rockets were not constructed in segments vulnerable to leakage through O-rings, which caused the destruction of.
* Energia&#x27;s four boosters were designed to be recovered after each flight, though they were not recovered during Energia&#x27;s two operational flights. The Space Shuttle&#x27;s boosters were recovered and reused.
*Buran equivalent of the Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System used GOX/LOX/Kerosene propellant, with lower toxicity and higher performance (a specific impulse of using a turbopump system) than the Shuttle&#x27;s pressure-fed monomethylhydrazine/dinitrogen tetroxide OMS engines.
*Buran was designed to be capable of both piloted and fully autonomous flight, including landing. The Space Shuttle was later retrofitted with remote control functions extending its existing crewed automated landing capability to enable uncrewed landings, first flown 18 years after the Buran on STS-121, but the system was intended to be used only in contingencies.
* The nose landing gear was located much farther back on the fuselage rather than just under the mid-deck as with the NASA Space Shuttle.
*Buran was designed to lift 30 metric tons into orbit in its standard configuration, comparable to the early Space Shuttle&#x27;s original 27.8 metric tons.
*Buran could return 20 tons from orbit, vs the Space Shuttle&#x27;s 15 tons.
*Buran included a drag chute; the Space Shuttle originally did not, but was later retrofitted to include one.
* The lift-to-drag ratio of Buran is cited as 5.6, compared to a subsonic L/D of 4.5 for the Space Shuttle.
*Buran and Energia were moved to the launch pad horizontally on a rail transporter, and then erected and fueled at the launch site. The Space Shuttle was transported vertically on the crawler-transporter with loaded solid boosters but the main tank was fueled at launch site.
*Buran was intended to carry a crew of up to ten. The Shuttle carried up to eight in the largest crewed mission, normally carried between five and seven people in most missions, and could have carried up to eleven in an emergency (such as in the unlaunched STS-400 rescue mission).
*Buran has a different thermal protection tile layout on its underside, in which all gaps between heat tiles are parallel or perpendicular to the direction of airflow around the orbiter.

<text>Northumbria (; ; ) was an early medieval Anglian kingdom in what is now Northern England and South Scotland.

The name derives from the &quot;Old English&quot; meaning &quot;the people or province north of the Humber&quot;, as opposed to the people south of the Humber Estuary. What was to become Northumbria started as two kingdoms, Deira in the south and Bernicia in the north. Conflict in the first half of the seventh century ended with the murder of the last king of Deira in 651, and Northumbria was thereafter unified under Bernician kings. At its height, the kingdom extended from the Humber, Peak District and the River Mersey on the south to the Firth of Forth on the north. Northumbria ceased to be an independent kingdom in the mid-tenth century when Deira was conquered by the Danes and formed into the Kingdom of York. The rump Earldom of Bamburgh maintained control of Bernicia for a period of time; however, the area north of the Tweed was eventually absorbed into the medieval Kingdom of Scotland while the portion south of the Tweed was absorbed into the Kingdom of England as the county of Northumberland and County Palatine of Durham.

==Kingdom (651–954)==
===Communities and divisions===
====Possible Celtic British origins====
The Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria was originally two kingdoms divided approximately around the River Tees: Bernicia was to the north of the river and Deira to the south. It is possible that both regions originated as native Celtic British kingdoms, which the Germanic settlers later conquered, although there is very little information about the infrastructure and culture of the British kingdoms themselves. Much of the evidence for them comes from regional names that are British rather than Anglo-Saxon in origin. The names Deira and Bernicia are likely British in origin, for example, indicating that some British place names retained currency after the Anglo-Saxon migrations to Northumbria. There is also some archeological evidence to support British origins for the polities of Bernicia and Deira. In what would have been southern Bernicia, in the Cheviot Hills, a hill fort at Yeavering Bell contains evidence that it was an important centre for first the British and later the Anglo-Saxons. The fort is originally pre-Roman, dating back to the Iron Age at around the first century. In addition to signs of Roman occupation, the site contains evidence of timber buildings that pre-date Germanic settlement in the area that are probably signs of British settlement. Moreover, Brian Hope-Taylor has traced the origins of the name Yeavering, which looks deceptively English, back to the British gafr from Bede&#x27;s mention of a township called Gefrin in the same area. Yeavering continued to be an important political centre after the Anglo-Saxons began settling in the north, as King Edwin had a royal palace at Yeavering.

Overall, English place-names dominate the Northumbrian landscape, suggesting the prevalence of an Anglo-Saxon elite culture by the time that Bede – Anglo-Saxon England&#x27;s most prominent historian – was writing in the eighth century. According to Bede, the Angles were the predominant Germanic immigrants, who settled north of the Humber and gained political prominence during this period. While the British natives may have partially assimilated into the Northumbrian political structure, relatively contemporary textual sources such as Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; depict relations between Northumbrians and the British as fraught.

====Unification of Bernicia and Deira====
The Anglo-Saxon states of Bernicia and Deira were often in conflict before their eventual semi-permanent unification in 651. Political power in Deira was concentrated in the East Riding of Yorkshire, which included York, the North York Moors, and the Vale of York. The political heartlands of Bernicia were the areas around Bamburgh and Lindisfarne, Monkwearmouth and Jarrow, and in Cumbria, west of the Pennines in the area around Carlisle. The name that these two states eventually united under, Northumbria, might have been coined by Bede and made popular through his &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;.

Information on the early royal genealogies for Bernicia and Deira comes from Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; and Nennius&#x27; &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;. According to Nennius, the Bernician royal line begins with Ida, son of Eoppa. Ida reigned for twelve years (beginning in 547) and was able to annex Bamburgh to Bernicia. In Nennius&#x27; genealogy of Deira, a king named Soemil was the first to separate Bernicia and Deira, which could mean that he wrested the kingdom of Deira from the native British. The date of this supposed separation is unknown. The first Deiran king to make an appearance in Bede&#x27;s is Ælla, the father of the first Christian Northumbrian king Edwin.

A king of Bernicia, Ida&#x27;s grandson Æthelfrith, was the first ruler to unite the two polities under his rule. He exiled the Deiran Edwin to the court of King Rædwald of East Anglia in order to claim both kingdoms, but Edwin returned in approximately 616 to conquer Northumbria with Rædwald&#x27;s aid. Edwin, who ruled from approximately 616 to 633, was one of the last kings of the Deiran line to reign over all of Northumbria. Oswald&#x27;s brother Oswiu eventually succeeded him to the Northumbrian throne despite initial attempts on Deira&#x27;s part to pull away again. The last independent king of Deira was Oswine. He was murdered by Oswiu in 651, and Northumbria was thereafter united under Bernician rule.

While violent conflicts between Bernicia and Deira played a significant part in determining which line ultimately gained supremacy in Northumbria, marriage alliances also helped bind these two territories together. Æthelfrith married Edwin&#x27;s sister Acha, although this marriage did little to prevent future squabbles between the brothers-in-law and their descendants. The second intermarriage was more successful, with Oswiu marrying Edwin&#x27;s daughter and his own cousin Eanflæd to produce Ecgfrith, the beginning of the Northumbrian line. However, Oswiu had another relationship with an Irish woman named Fina which produced the problematic Aldfrith. In his &quot;Life and Miracles of St. Cuthbert,&quot; Bede declares that Aldfrith, known as Fland among the Irish, was illegitimate and therefore unfit to rule.

====Northumbria and Norse settlement====

The Viking invasions of the ninth century and the establishment of the Danelaw once again divided Northumbria. Although primarily recorded in the southern provinces of England, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles (particularly the D and E recensions) provide some information on Northumbria&#x27;s conflicts with Vikings in the late eighth and early ninth centuries. According to these chronicles, Viking raids began to affect Northumbria when a band attacked Lindisfarne in 793. After this initial catastrophic blow, Viking raids in Northumbria were either sporadic for much of the early ninth century or evidence of them was lost. However, in 865 the so-called Great Heathen Army landed in East Anglia and began a sustained campaign of conquest. The Great Army fought in Northumbria in 866–867, striking York twice in less than one year. After the initial attack the Norse left to go north, leaving Kings Ælle and Osberht to recapture the city. The E recension of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle suggests that Northumbria was particularly vulnerable at this time because the Northumbrians were once again fighting amongst themselves, deposing Osberht in favour of Ælle. In the second raid, the Vikings killed Kings Ælle and Osberht whilst recapturing the city.

After King Alfred re-established his control of southern England, the Norse invaders settled into what came to be known as the Danelaw in the Midlands, East Anglia, and the southern part of Northumbria. In Northumbria, the Norse established the Kingdom of York whose boundaries were roughly the River Tees and the Humber, giving it approximately the same dimensions as Deira. Although this kingdom fell to Hiberno-Norse colonisers in the 920s and was in constant conflict with the West-Saxon expansionists from the south, it survived until 954 when the last Scandinavian king Eric, who is usually identified as Eric Bloodaxe, was driven out and eventually killed.

In contrast, the Great Army was not as successful in conquering territory north of the River Tees. There were raids that extended into that area, but no sources mention lasting Norse occupation and there are very few Scandinavian place names to indicate significant Norse settlement in northern regions of Northumbria. The political landscape of the area north of the Tees during the Viking conquest of Northumbria consisted of the Community of St. Cuthbert and the remnants of the English Northumbrian elites. While the religious Community of St. Cuthbert &quot;wandered&quot; for a hundred years after Halfdan Ragnarsson attacked their original home of Lindisfarne in 875, The History of St. Cuthbert indicates that they settled temporarily at Chester-le-Street between the years 875–883 on land granted to them by the Viking King of York, Guthred. According to the twelfth-century account &quot;Historia Regum&quot;, Guthred granted them this land in exchange for establishing him as king. The land extended from the Tees to the Tyne and anyone who fled there from either the north or the south would receive sanctuary for thirty-seven days, indicating that the Community of St. Cuthbert had some juridical autonomy. Based on their positioning and this right of sanctuary, this community probably acted as a buffer between the Norse in southern Northumbria and the Anglo-Saxons who continued to hold the north.

North of the Tyne, Northumbrians maintained partial political control in Bamburgh. The rule of kings continued in that area with Ecgberht I acting as regent around 867 and the kings Ricsige and Ecgberht II immediately following him. According to twelfth-century historian Symeon of Durham, Ecgberht I was a client-king for the Norse. The Northumbrians revolted against him in 872, deposing him in favour of Ricsige. Although the A and E recensions of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; report that Halfdan was able to take control of Deira and take a raiding party north of the River Tyne to impose his rule on Bernicia in 874, after Halfdan&#x27;s death () the Norse had difficulty holding on to territory in northern Bernicia. Ricsige and his successor Ecgberht were able to maintain an English presence in Northumbria. After the reign of Ecgberht II, Eadwulf &quot;King of the North Saxons&quot; (r. 890–912) succeeded him for control of Bamburgh, but after Eadwulf&#x27;s death rulership of this area switched over to earls who were possible kinsmen or direct descendants of the royal Northumbrian house.

===Kings===
====Æthelfrith (r. 593–616)====

Æthelfrith was the first Anglo-Saxon leader to hold the thrones of both Deira and Bernicia, and so he ruled over all the people north of the Humber. His rule was notable for his numerous victories over the Britons and the Gaels.

====Edwin (r. 616–633)====

Edwin, like Æthelfrith, was king of both Deira and Bernicia and ruled them from 616 to 633. Under his reign, the Isle of Man and the lands of Gwynedd in Northern Wales were incorporated into Northumbria. Edwin married Æthelburh, a Christian Princess from Kent in 625. He converted to Christianity two years later after a period of heavy consideration and after consulting numerous advisors. Edwin fell in battle in 633 against Cadwallon of Gwynedd and the pagan Penda of Mercia. He was venerated as a saint and martyr after his death.

====Oswald (r. 634–642)====

Oswald was a king of Bernicia, who regained the kingdom of Deira after defeating Cadwallon in 634. Oswald then ruled Northumbria until his death in 642. A devout Christian, Oswald worked tirelessly to spread the faith in his traditionally pagan lands. It was during his reign that the monastery at Lindisfarne was created. Oswald fell in the Battle of Maserfield against Penda of Mercia in 642 but his influence endured because, like Edwin, Oswald was venerated as a saint after his death.

====Oswiu (r. 642–670)====

Oswiu was the brother of Oswald and succeeded him after the latter&#x27;s defeat in Maserfield. Oswiu succeeded where Edwin and Oswald failed as, in 655, he slew Penda during the Battle of the Winwaed, making him the first Northumbrian King also to control the kingdom of Mercia. During his reign, he presided over the Synod of Whitby, an attempt to reconcile religious differences between Roman and Celtic Christianity, in which he eventually backed Rome. Oswiu died from illness in 670 and divided Deira and Bernicia between two of his sons. His son Aldfrith of Northumbria took over the throne upon his death.

==== Eadberht (r. 738–758) ====
Eadberht of Northumbria, the brother of Ecgbert, Archbishop of York, is seen by some historians as a return to the imperial ambitions of seventh-century Northumbria and his reign may represent a period of economic prosperity. He faced internal opposition from rival dynasties and at least two actual or potential rivals were killed during his reign. In 758 he abdicated in favour of his son Oswulf and became a monk at York. Oswulf was murdered the next year and Æthelwald Moll of Northumbria seized the throne, which he occupied for seven years until he was deposed by Alhred. Æthelred I of Northumbria, son of Æthelwald, reigned for 10 interrupted years to 796.

====Halfdan Ragnarsson (r. 876–877)====

Halfdan Ragnarsson was a Viking leader of the Great Heathen Army which invaded England in 865. He allegedly wanted revenge against Northumbria for the death of his father, who was supposedly killed by Ælla of Northumbria. While he himself only ruled Northumbria directly for about a year in 876, he placed Ecgberht on the throne as a client-king, who ruled from 867 to 872. Halfdan was killed in Ireland in 877 whilst trying to regain control over Dyflin (Dublin), a land he had ruled since 875. There were no further Viking kings in Northumbria until Guthfrith took over in 883.

====Æthelstan of Wessex (r. 927–939)====

Æthelstan ruled as King of the Anglo-Saxons from 924 to 927 and King of the English from 927 to 939. The shift in his title reflects that in 927, Æthelstan conquered the Viking Kingdom of York, previously part of the Northumbrian Kingdom. His reign was quite prosperous and saw great strides in many fields such as law and economics, but was also characterized by frequent clashes with the Scots and the Vikings. Æthelstan died in 939, which led to the Vikings&#x27; retaking of York. Æthelstan is widely considered one of the greatest Anglo-Saxon kings for his efforts to consolidate the English kingdom and the prosperity his reign brought.

====Eric of York (r. 947–948, 952–954)====

In the early twentieth century, historians identified Eric of York with the Norwegian king Eric Bloodaxe, although more recent scholarship has challenged this association. He held two short terms as King of Northumbria, from 947 to 948 and 952 to 954. Historical documentation on his reign is scarce, but it seems Eric pushed out the joint English-Viking rulers of Northumbria in 947, who then regained the land in 948 or 949. Eric took back the throne in 952, only to be deposed again in 954. Eric was the last Viking king of Northumbria and his authority only extended to the southern kingdom of York. In 954 he was murdered, allegedly with the connivance of Oswulf, the Anglo-Saxon ruler of the northern Northumbrian territory of Bamburgh.

====Eadred of Wessex (r. 946–954)====

King Eadred was the half-brother of Æthelstan and full brother of Edmund, all of whom were sons of King Edward the Elder. Eadred inherited the rule of Northumbria, but like Edmund lost it soon afterwards. When Eadred finally regained control in 954, he appointed Oswulf earl of the whole of Northumbria.

===Politics and war===

Between the years of AD 737 and 806, Northumbria had ten kings, all of whom were murdered, deposed, or exiled or became monks. Between Oswiu, the first king of Northumbria in 651, and Eric Bloodaxe, the last king of Northumbria in 954, there were forty-five kings, meaning that the average length of reign during the entire history of Northumbria is only six and a half years. Of the twenty-five kings before the Danish rule of Northumbria, only four died of natural causes. Of those that did not abdicate for a holy life, the rest were either deposed, exiled, or murdered. Kings during the Danish rule of Northumbria (see Danelaw) were often either kings of a larger North Sea or Danish empire, or were installed rulers.

Succession in Northumbria was hereditary, which left princes whose fathers died before they could come of age particularly susceptible to assassination and usurpation. A noteworthy example of this phenomenon is Osred, whose father Aldfrith died in 705, leaving the young boy to rule. He survived one assassination attempt early in his rule, but fell victim to another assassin at the age of nineteen. During his reign he was adopted by Wilfrid, a powerful bishop. Ecclesiastical influence in the royal court was not an unusual phenomenon in Northumbria, and usually was most visible during the rule of a young or inexperienced king. Similarly, ealdorman, or royal advisors, had periods of increased or decreased power in Northumbria, depending on who was ruling at the time.

Warfare in Northumbria before the Danish period largely consisted of rivalries with the Picts to the north. The Northumbrians were successful against the Picts until the Battle of Dun Nechtain in 685, which halted their expansion north and established a border between the two kingdoms. Warfare during the Danish period was dominated by warfare between the Northumbrians and other English Kingdoms.

==Ealdormen and earldoms of Northumbria==
After the English from Wessex absorbed the Danish-ruled territories south of the Tees, Scots invasions reduced the rump Northumbria to an earldom stretching from the Tyne to the Tweed. The surviving Earldom of Northumbria, alongside the Haliwerfolk between the Tyne and Tees, were then disputed between the emerging kingdoms of England and Scotland, with the Earldom being split roughly in half along the River Tweed.

==Religion==
===Roman and post-Roman Britain===
Under Roman rule, some Britons north of the Humber practised Christianity. York had a bishop as early as the fourth century. After the Romans left Britain in the early fifth century, Christianity did not disappear, but it existed alongside Celtic paganism, and possibly many other cults. Anglo-Saxons brought their own Germanic pagan beliefs and practices when they settled there. At Yeavering, in Bernicia, excavations have uncovered evidence of a pagan shrine, animal sacrifice, and ritual burials.

=== Conversion of the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity ===
The first King of Northumbria to convert to Christianity was King Edwin. He was baptized by Paulinus in 627. Shortly thereafter, many of his people followed his conversion to the new religion, only to return to paganism when Edwin was killed in 633. Paulinus was Bishop of York, but only for a year.

The lasting conversion of Northumbria took place under the guidance of the Irish cleric Aidan. He converted King Oswald of Northumbria in 635, and then worked to convert the people of Northumbria. King Oswald moved the bishopric from York to Lindisfarne.

===Monasteries and figures of note===
The monastery at Lindisfarne was founded by Aidan in 635, and based on the practices of the Columban monastery in Iona, Scotland. The location of the bishopric shifted to Lindisfarne, and it became the centre for religion in Northumbria. The bishopric would not leave Lindisfarne and shift back to its original location at York until 664. Throughout the eighth century, Lindisfarne was associated with important figures. Aidan, the founder, Wilfrid, a student, and Cuthbert, a member of the order and a hermit, all became bishops and later Saints. Aidan assisted Hieu to found her double monastery at Hartlepool. She too came to be venerated as a saint.

The Christianity culture of Northumbria was influenced by the continent as well as Ireland. In particular, Wilfrid travelled to Rome and abandoned the traditions of the Celtic church in favour of Roman practices. When he returned to England, he became abbot of a new monastery at Ripon in 660. Wilfrid advocated acceptance of the authority of Rome at the Synod of Whitby. The two-halves of the double monastery Monkwearmouth–Jarrow were founded by the nobleman Benedict Biscop in 673 and 681. Biscop became the first abbot of the monastery, and travelled to Rome six times to buy books for the library. His successor, Abbot Ceolfrith, continued to add to the library until by one estimate the library at Monkwearmouth–Jarrow had over two hundred volumes. One who benefited from this library was Bede.

In the early seventh century in York, Paulinus founded a school and a minster but not a monastery. The School at York Minster is one of the oldest in England. By the late eighth century, the school had a noteworthy library, estimated at one hundred volumes. Alcuin was a student and teacher at York before he left for the court of Charlemagne in 782.

===Synod of Whitby===

In 664, King Oswiu called the Synod of Whitby to determine whether to follow Roman or Irish customs. Since Northumbria was converted to Christianity by the Celtic clergy, the Celtic tradition for determining the date of Easter and Irish tonsure were supported by many, particularly by the Abbey of Lindisfarne. Roman Christianity was also represented in Northumbria, by Wilfrid, Abbot of Ripon. By the year 620, both sides were associating the other&#x27;s Easter observance with the Pelagian Heresy. The King decided at Whitby that Roman practice would be adopted throughout Northumbria, thereby bringing Northumbria in line with Southern England and Western Europe. Members of the clergy who refused to conform, including the Celtic Bishop Colman of Lindisfarne, returned to Iona. The episcopal seat of Northumbria transferred from Lindisfarne to York, which later became an archbishopric in 735.

===Impact of Scandinavian raiding, settlement and culture ===
The Viking attack on Lindisfarne in 793 was the first of many raids on monasteries of Northumbria. The Lindisfarne Gospels survived, but monastic culture in Northumbria went into a period of decline in the early ninth century. Repeated Viking assaults on religious centres were one reason for the decrease in production of manuscripts and communal monastic culture.

After 867, Northumbria came under control of the Scandinavian forces, and there was an influx of Scandinavian immigrants. Their religion was pagan and had a rich mythology. Within the Kingdom of York, once the raids and war were over, there is no evidence that the presence of Scandinavian settlers interrupted Christian practice. It appears that they gradually adopted Christianity and blended their Scandinavian culture with their new religion. This can be seen in carved stone monuments and ring-headed crosses, such as the Gosforth Cross. During the ninth and tenth centuries, there was an increase in the number of parish churches, often including stone sculptures incorporating Scandinavian designs.

==Culture==


===Golden Age of Northumbria===

The Christian culture of Northumbria, fuelled by influences from the continent and Ireland, promoted a broad range of literary and artistic works.

===Insular art===
The Irish monks who converted Northumbria to Christianity, and established monasteries such as Lindisfarne, brought a style of artistic and literary production. Eadfrith of Lindisfarne produced the Lindisfarne Gospels in an Insular style.

The Irish monks brought with them an ancient Celtic decorative tradition of curvilinear forms of spirals, scrolls, and doubles curves. This style was integrated with the abstract ornamentation of the native pagan Anglo-Saxon metalwork tradition, characterized by its bright colouring and zoomorphic interlace patterns.

Insular art, rich in symbolism and meaning, is characterized by its concern for geometric design rather than naturalistic representation, love of flat areas of colour, and use of complicated interlace patterns. All of these elements appear in the Lindisfarne Gospels (early eighth century). The Insular style was eventually imported to the European continent, exercising great influence on the art of the Carolingian empire.
Usage of the Insular style was not limited to manuscript production and metalwork. It can be seen in and sculpture, such as the Ruthwell Cross and Bewcastle Cross. The devastating Viking raid on Lindisfarne in 793 marked the beginning of a century of Viking invasions that severely limited the production and survival of Anglo-Saxon material culture. It heralded the end of Northumbria&#x27;s position as a centre of influence, although in the years immediately following visually rich works like the Easby Cross were still being produced.

===Literature===
The Venerable Bede (673–735) is the most famous author of the Anglo-Saxon Period, and a native of Northumbria. His (&quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, completed in 731) has become both a template for later historians and a crucial historical account in its own right, and much of it focuses on Northumbria. He&#x27;s also famous for his theological works, and verse and prose accounts of holy lives. After the Synod of Whitby, the role of the European continent gained importance in Northumbrian culture. During the end of the eighth century, the scriptorium at Monkwearmouth–Jarrow was producing manuscripts of his works for high demand on the Continent.

Northumbria was also home to several Anglo-Saxon Christian poets. Cædmon lived at the double monastery of Streonæshalch (Whitby Abbey) during the abbacy (657–680) of St. Hilda (614–680). According to Bede, he &quot;was wont to make religious verses, so that whatever was interpreted to him out of scripture, he soon after put the same into poetical expressions of much sweetness and humility in English, which was his native language. By his verse the minds of many were often excited to despise the world, and to aspire to heaven.&quot; His sole surviving work is Cædmon&#x27;s Hymn. Cynewulf, prolific author of &quot;The Fates of the Apostles&quot;, &quot;Juliana&quot;, &quot;Elene&quot;, and &quot;Christ II&quot;, is believed to have been either Northumbrian or Mercian.
===Scandinavians and the Danelaw===
From around 800, there had been waves of Danish raids on the coastlines of the British Isles. These raids terrorized the populace, but exposure to Danish society brought new opportunities for wealth and trade. In 865, instead of raiding, the Danes landed a large army in East Anglia, and had conquered a territory known as the Danelaw, including Northumbria, by 867. At first, the Scandinavian minority, while politically powerful, remained culturally distinct from the English populace. For example, only a few Scandinavian words, mostly military and technical, became part of Old English. By the early 900s, however, Scandinavian-style names for both people and places became increasingly popular, as did Scandinavian ornamentation on works of art, featuring aspects of Norse mythology, and figures of animals and warriors. Nevertheless, sporadic references to &quot;Danes&quot; in charters, chronicles, and laws indicate that during the lifetime of the Kingdom of Northumbria, most inhabitants of northeast England did not consider themselves Danish, and were not perceived as such by other Anglo-Saxons.

The synthesis of Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian and Christian and Pagan visual motifs within the Danelaw can be illustrated by an examination of stone sculpture. However, the tradition of mixing pagan and Christian motifs is not unique to the Danelaw, and examples of such synthesis can be seen in previous examples, such as the Franks Casket. The Franks Casket, believed to have been produced in Northumbria, includes depictions of Germanic legends and stories of the founding Roman and the Roman Church and is dated to the early eighth century. The Gosforth Cross, dated to the early tenth century, stands at and is richly decorated with carvings of mythical beasts, Norse gods, and Christian symbolism. Stone sculpture was not a practice of native Scandinavian culture, and the proliferation of stone monuments within the Danelaw shows the influence that the English had on Viking settlers. On one side of the Gosforth Cross is a depiction of the Crucifixion; whilst on the other are scenes from Ragnarok. The melding of these distinctive religious cultures can further be seen in the depiction of Mary Magdalene as a valkyrie, with a trailing dress and long pigtail. Although one can read the iconography as the triumph of Christianity over paganism, it is possible that in the process of gradual conversion the Vikings might have initially accepted the Christian god as an addition to the broad pantheon of pagan gods. The inclusion of pagan traditions in visual culture reflects the creation of a distinctive Anglo-Scandinavian culture. Consequently, this indicates that conversion not only required a change in belief, but also necessitated its assimilation, integration, and modification into existing cultural structures.

==Economy==
Northumbria&#x27;s economy centred around agriculture, with livestock and land being popular units of value in local trade. By the mid 800s, the Open field system was likely the pre-eminent mode of farming. Like much of eastern England, Northumbria exported grain, silver, hides, and slaves. Imports from Frankia included oil, luxury goods, and clerical supplies in the 700s. Especially after 793, raids, gifts, and trade with Scandinavians resulted in substantial economic ties across the North Sea.

When coinage (as opposed to bartering) regained popularity in the late 600s, Northumbrian coins featured kings&#x27; names, indicating royal control of currency. Royal currency was unique in Britain for a long time. King Aldfrith (685–705) minted Northumbria&#x27;s earliest silver coins, likely in York. Later royal coinage bears the name of King Eadberht (738–758), as well as his brother, Archbishop Ecgbert of York. These coins were primarily small silver sceattas, more suitable to small, everyday transactions than larger gold Frankish or Roman coins. During the reign of King Eanred the silver content of the coins declined until they were produced in copper alloy, these coins are commonly known as stycas, but the term is an antiquarian invention. Stycas remains in use throughout the kingdom until at least the 860s and possibly later. Larger bullion values can be seen in the silver ingots found in the Bedale Hoard, along with sword fittings and necklaces in gold and silver.

==Language==

In the time of Bede, there were five languages in Britain: English, British, Irish, Pictish, and Latin. Northumbrian was one of four distinct dialects of Old English, along with Mercian, West Saxon, and Kentish. Analysis of written texts, brooches, runes and other available sources shows that Northumbrian vowel pronunciation differed from West Saxon. 
Although loans borrowed from the Celtic Languages, such as the Common Brittonic language of the Britons, and the Old Irish of the Irish missionaries, into Old English were few, some place-names such as Deira and Bernicia derive their names from Celtic tribal origins.
In addition to the five languages present in Bede&#x27;s day, Old Norse was added during the ninth century. This was due to the settlements of the in the north and east of England, an area that became the Danelaw. This language had a strong influence on the dialect of Northumbria. These settlers gave the region many place-names from their language as well as contributing to the vocabulary, syntax, and grammar of Old English. Similarities in basic vocabulary between Old English and Old Norse may have led to the dropping of their different inflectional endings. The number of borrowed words is conservatively estimated to be around nine-hundred in standard English but rises to the thousands in some dialects.

<text>The San Juan Islands is an archipelago in the Pacific Northwest of the United States between the U.S. state of Washington and Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. The San Juan Islands are part of Washington state, and form the core of San Juan County.

In the archipelago, four islands are accessible to vehicular and foot traffic via the Washington State Ferries system.

==History==

The Gulf of Georgia Culture Area encompasses the San Juan and Gulf Islands, which share many archaeological similarities. These islands were home to various Coast Salish peoples, including the Nooksack and Northern Straits groups (consisting of the Lummi, Klallam, Saanich, Samish, and Songhees dialects). European exploration in the area introduced smallpox in the 1770s.

The Spanish explorer Francisco de Eliza named the San Juan Islands &quot;Isla y Archipiélago de San Juan&quot; in 1791 while sailing under the authority of Juan Vicente de Güemes Padilla Horcasitas y Aguayo, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo, the Viceroy of Mexico. Eliza named several places for the Viceroy, including Orcas Island (short for &quot;Horcasitas&quot;) and Guemes Island. San Juan Island&#x27;s first European discoverer was Gonzalo López de Haro, one of Eliza&#x27;s officers, for whom Haro Strait is named. The Spanish had previously encountered the islands during Manuel Quimper&#x27;s exploring voyage on the &quot;Princesa Real&quot; in 1790, but they were not recognized as islands until Eliza&#x27;s expedition. José María Narváez, one of Eliza&#x27;s pilots, also helped explore the San Juans in 1791 and became the first European to explore the Strait of Georgia.

The Vancouver Expedition, led by George Vancouver, explored the area in 1792 while a Spanish expedition led by Dionisio Alcalá Galiano and Cayetano Valdés y Flores was also exploring. The British and Spanish ships met and cooperated in exploring the north. Vancouver encountered other Spanish ships and traded information, so he was aware of the names given by the Spanish expedition and kept them, although he renamed some features, such as the Strait of Georgia.

The United States Exploring Expedition, led by Charles Wilkes, explored the region in 1841. Wilkes named many coastal features after American heroes of the War of 1812 or members of his crew, possibly unaware of the already existing Spanish names and charts.

Henry Kellett led a project in 1847 to reorganize the official charts of the region for the British Admiralty. The project only applied to British territory, which at the time included the San Juan Islands but not Puget Sound. Kellett removed most of the names given by Wilkes and kept British and Spanish names, sometimes moving Spanish names to replace those given by Wilkes. As a result, Wilkes&#x27; names are common in Puget Sound and Spanish names are rare, while the opposite is true for the San Juan and Gulf Islands. Wilkes had named the San Juan Islands the &quot;Navy Archipelago&quot; and individual islands after U.S. naval officers, such as &quot;Rodgers Island&quot; for San Juan Island, &quot;Chauncey&quot; for Lopez Island, and &quot;Hull Island&quot; for Orcas Island. Some of Wilkes&#x27; names, such as Shaw, Decatur, Jones, Blakely, and Sinclair, named after American naval officers, survived Kellett&#x27;s editing.

===Border dispute===


In 1843, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company established Fort Victoria on Vancouver Island. The 1846 Oregon Treaty established the 49th parallel as the border between Canada and the US, with Vancouver Island remaining British. The treaty did not specify which channel the border should follow between the Strait of Georgia and the Strait of Juan de Fuca, leading to a boundary dispute. In 1852, the Territory of Oregon created Island County, including the San Juan Islands. In 1853, Island County became part of the Washington Territory, which created Whatcom County out of parts of Island County in 1854. The San Juan Islands were finally split off into present-day San Juan County in 1873.

In 1855, Washington Territory levied a property tax on properties of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company on San Juan Island, which the HBC refused to pay. This led to a dispute with the Colony of Vancouver Island over the ownership of the San Juan Islands, with the US claiming Haro Strait as the border and Britain claiming Rosario Strait. The resulting Pig War and San Juan Dispute were a diplomatic stalemate until the boundary issue was placed in the hands of Emperor Wilhelm I of Germany for arbitration in 1871. The border through Haro Strait was established in 1872.

===Post-border dispute===
The surrounding bodies of water, including Puget Sound and the Straits of Georgia and Juan de Fuca, were recognized collectively as the Salish Sea, by the United States in 2009 and by Canada in 2010.

On the 7th of June 2024, a T-34 plane flown by former astronaut and air force pilot, Bill Anders, crashed on the San Juan Islands. Anders did not survive the crash. 

==Ecology==
The islands were heavily logged in the nineteenth century, but now have an extensive second-growth coast Douglas fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii&quot;), Pacific madrone (&quot;Arbutus menziesii&quot;), red alder (&quot;Alnus rubra&quot;) and bigleaf maple (&quot;Acer macrophyllum&quot;) forest. There are small strands of old-growth Douglas fir and western redcedar (&quot;Thuja plicata&quot;), mostly within long standing privately held property. In the highlands one also finds grand fir (&quot;Abies grandis&quot;), western hemlock (&quot;Tsuga heterophylla&quot;) and other subalpine trees.

The San Juan Islands host the greatest concentration of bald eagles (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus&quot;) in the contiguous United States. Great blue herons (&quot;Ardea herodias&quot;), black oystercatchers (&quot;Haematopus bachman&quot;), and numerous shorebirds are found along the shore and in winter, the islands are home to trumpeter swans (&quot;Cygnus buccinator&quot;), Canada geese (&quot;Branta canadensis&quot;) and other waterfowl. Peregrine falcons (&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;), northern harriers (&quot;Circus cyaneus&quot;), barred owls (&quot;Strix varia&quot;) and other birds of prey are found. In addition diving birds such as rhinoceros auklets (&quot;Cerorhinca monocerata&quot;), pigeon guillemots (&quot;Cepphus columba&quot;) and endangered marbled murrelets (&quot;Brachyramphus marmoratus&quot;) frequent the surrounding seas. Western bluebirds (&quot;Sialia mexicana&quot;), which were eliminated from the islands 50 years ago because of competition for nesting sites by non-native European starlings (&quot;Sturnus vulgaris&quot;), were recently restored to San Juan Island thanks to the efforts of volunteers and conservation organizations.

The islands are famous for their resident pods of orcas (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;). There are three resident pods that eat salmon, but also some transient orcas that come to take harbor seals (&quot;Phoca vitulina&quot;). Other marine mammals include river otters (&quot;Lontra canadensis&quot;), Steller sea lions (&quot;Eumetopias jubatus&quot;), common minke whales (&quot;Balaenoptera acutorostrata&quot;), Dall&#x27;s porpoises (&quot;Phocoenoides dalli&quot;) and other cetaceans.

Columbia black-tailed deer (&quot;Odocoileus hemionus columbianus&quot;) are the largest mammals on the San Juan Islands, which are unusual in their historic absence of large carnivores, except for wolves (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;) which were extirpated in the 1860s. Dr. Caleb B. R. Kennerly, surgeon and naturalist, collected a wolf specimen on Lopez Island, which is now in the National Museum of Natural History, probably during the Northwest Boundary Survey from 1857 to 1861. Also, there is a specimen of elk in the Slater Museum of Natural History at the University of Puget Sound that was collected on Orcas Island, and old-timers report finding elk antlers on both Lopez and Orcas Islands.

Before 1850, most of the freshwater on the islands was held in beaver (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;) ponds, although the aquatic mammal was extirpated by Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company fur stations at Fort Langley and San Juan Island. Remnants of beaver dams number in the hundreds across the archipelago. Gnawed stumps and beaver sign are now seen on Orcas and other islands, and recolonization by this keystone species is likely to lead to increased abundance and diversity of birds, amphibians, reptiles and plants. In spring 2011 a pair of beaver appeared at Killebrew Lake on Orcas Island, but were killed to avoid flooding a phone company switch box buried under Dolphin Bay Road. These beaver likely swam from the mainland and could have recolonized the islands.

Northern sea otter (&quot;Enhydra lutis kenyoni&quot;) remains are documented on Sucia Island in the San Juan Islands archipelago. In 1790, Spanish explorer Manuel Quimper traded copper sheets for sea otter pelts at Discovery Bay, for live sea otters captured north of the bay in the &quot;interior&quot; of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Although historical records of sea otter in the San Juan Islands are sparse, there is a sea otter specimen collected in 1897 in the &quot;Strait of Fuca&quot; in the National Museum of Natural History. When the sea otter finally received federal protection in 1911, Washington&#x27;s sea otter had been hunted to extinction, and although a small remnant population still existed in British Columbia, it soon died out. Fifty-nine sea otters were re-introduced to the Washington coast from Amchitka Island, Alaska, in the summers of 1969 and 1970, and these have expanded by 8% per year, mainly along the outer west and northwest coast of the Olympic Peninsula. Professional marine mammal biologists verified a single sea otter observed near Cattle Point, San Juan Island, in October 1996. Although the historical numbers of sea otter in the San Juan Islands is not known, the habitat for them may have once been ideal.

In the 1890s non-native European rabbits, an exotic invasive species, began to infest the islands as the result of the release of domestic rabbits on Smith Island. Rabbits from the San Juan Islands were used later for several introductions of European rabbits into other, usually Midwestern, states. The rabbits are pursued by Eurasian red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;), another non-native species introduced intermittently through the twentieth century.

On the islands is the San Juan Islands National Monument with 75 sections.

== Geography ==

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) defines the San Juan Islands as the archipelago north of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, west of Rosario Strait, east of Haro Strait, and south of Boundary Pass. To the north lie the open waters of the Strait of Georgia. All these waters are within the Salish Sea. The USGS definition of the San Juan archipelago coincides with San Juan County. Islands not in San Juan County are not part of the San Juan Islands, according to the USGS. NOAA notes that, while geopolitically divided, the San Juan Islands and Canadian Gulf Islands geologically form part of a larger Gulf Archipelago.

At mean high tide, the San Juan Islands comprise over 400 islands and rocks, 128 of which are named, and over of shoreline.

The majority of the San Juan Islands are quite hilly, with some flat areas and valleys in between, often quite fertile. The tallest peak is Mount Constitution, on Orcas Island, at an elevation of . The coastlines are a mix of sandy and rocky beaches, shallow inlets and deep harbors, placid coves and reef-studded bays. Gnarled, ochre-colored madrona trees (&quot;Arbutus&quot;) grace much of the shorelines, while evergreen fir and pine forests cover large inland areas.

The San Juan Islands get substantially less rainfall than Seattle, about to the south, due to their location in the rain shadow of the Olympic Mountains to the southwest. Summertime high temperatures are around , while average wintertime lows are in the high 30s and low 40s Fahrenheit (around 5 degrees Celsius). Snow is infrequent in winter, except for the higher elevations, but the islands are subject to high winds at times; those from the northeast sometimes bring brief periods of freezing.

==Present==
In the present, the San Juan Islands are an important tourist destination, with sea kayaking and orca whale-watching (by boat or air tours) being two of the primary attractions. San Juan Island&#x27;s Lime Kiln Point State Park is a prime whale-watching site, with knowledgeable interpreters often on site.

Politically, the San Juan Islands comprise by definition, San Juan County, Washington.

Media based in and/or concerning the islands includes the &quot;Journal of the San Juan Islands&quot; and the &quot;Islands&#x27; Sounder&quot;.

Generally speaking, the resident population of San Juan County is well educated. In the period 2016 to 2020, 51.7 percent of the resident population aged 25 and up have earned a bachelor’s degree or attained a higher level of formal education. Statewide, 36.7 percent of the adult population have a bachelor’s degree or higher.

==Transportation==
There are no bridges to the San Juan Islands; therefore, all travel from the mainland is either by water or by air.

===Water===
Four ferry systems serve some of the San Juan Islands.
*Washington State Ferries serves Lopez Island, Shaw Island, Orcas Island, and San Juan Island from terminals in Anacortes, Washington, and Sidney, British Columbia.
*Puget Sound Express provides passenger-only service from Port Townsend, on the northeast corner of the Olympic Peninsula, to Friday Harbor on San Juan Island.
*&quot;M/V San Juan Clipper&quot; of Clipper Navigation, Inc. provides high-speed water-jet–powered catamaran ferry service between San Juan Island and Seattle, Washington.

Passenger-only ferries serve more islands. Passenger-only ferry service is usually seasonal and offered by private business.
*San Juan Cruises offers charter service to Eliza Island, Sinclair Island, Blakely Island, Orcas Island, Lopez Island and daily seasonal service to San Juan Island from the Bellingham Cruise Terminal in Bellingham, Washington.
*North Shore Charters provides high-speed water taxi service to all of the main San Juan Islands.

===Air===
There are a number of public and private airports and seaplane bases throughout the San Juan Islands.

Airports:
* Lopez Island: Lopez Island Airport (S31)
* Orcas Island: Orcas Island Airport (KORS)
* San Juan Island: Friday Harbor Airport (KHFR), Roche Harbor (W39)

Seaplane bases:
* Orcas Island: Rosairo (W49)
* San Juan Island: Friday Harbor (W33)

Scheduled and on demand service to the San Juan Islands is provided by:
* Kenmore Air (to and from Roche Harbor, Orcas Island, Seattle/Boeing Field, Seattle/Lake Union)
* San Juan Airlines (to and from Anacortes, Bellingham, Eastsound (Orcas Island), Lopez Island, Blakely, Decatur). They merged with Northwest Sky Ferry, an inter-island carrier serving Bellingham, Anacortes, Friday and Roche Harbors (San Juan Island), Eastsound (Orcas Island) and Lopez, Waldron, Shaw, Stuart, Blakely, Center, Crane, Decatur and Eliza Islands, as well as Seattle.
*Friday Harbor Seaplanes (to and from Renton Municipal Airport/Lake Washington, Friday Harbor and Roche Harbor)

===Shipping===
The San Juan Islands are surrounded by major shipping channels. Haro Strait, along with Boundary Pass, is the westernmost and most heavily used channel connecting the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Strait of Georgia. It is the main route connecting the Port of Vancouver and other ports around the Strait of Georgia with the Pacific Ocean. Haro Strait joins Boundary Pass at Turn Point on Stuart Island, where a major navigation beacon, Turn Point Light, is located. Strong, dangerous rip tides occur near Turn Point, as well as near the northern end of Boundary Pass, between Patos Island Light on Patos Island and East Point on Saturna Island.

Rosario Strait is also a major shipping channel. More than 500 oil tankers pass through the strait each year, to and from the Cherry Point Refinery and refineries near Anacortes. The strait is in constant use by vessels bound for Cherry Point, Bellingham, Anacortes, and the San Juan Islands. Vessels bound for British Columbia or Alaska also frequently use it in preference to the passages farther west, when greater advantage can be taken of the tidal currents.

<text>Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion (SCUMM) is a video game engine developed at Lucasfilm Games, later renamed LucasArts, to ease development on their graphic adventure game &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; (1987). It was subsequently used as the engine for later LucasArts adventure games and Humongous Entertainment games.

It falls somewhere between a game engine and a programming language, allowing designers to create locations, items and dialogue sequences without writing code in the language in which the game source code ends up. This also allowed the game&#x27;s script and data files to be cross-platform, i.e., re-used across various platforms. SCUMM is also a host for embedded game engines such as the &quot;Interactive MUsic Streaming Engine&quot; (iMUSE), the &quot;INteractive Streaming ANimation Engine&quot; (INSANE), CYST (in-game animation engine), FLEM (places and names object inside a room), and MMUCAS. SCUMM has been released on these platforms: 3DO, Amiga, Apple II, Atari ST, CDTV, Commodore 64, FM Towns &amp; Marty, Macintosh, Nintendo Entertainment System, MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, Sega CD (Mega-CD), and TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine. Several SCUMM games have been officially and unofficially ported to other systems through use of the open-source ScummVM software.
== History ==
The original version was coded by Ron Gilbert (with some initial help by Chip Morningstar a.k.a. UnXman) in 1987, with later versions enhanced by Aric Wilmunder (a.k.a., the &quot;SCUMM Lord&quot;) and Brad P. Taylor. This is a token language that provided groundbreaking coding techniques. Tokens like P.R.I.N.E. were the first to be utilized.

The nature of SCUMM emerged from the background of most of the early programmers at LucasArts, including Wilmunder, who had been programmers for minicomputers and Unix workstations. At the time, personal computers (PC) did not have large enough abilities or speed to edit and compile programs, so often the LucasArts coders would write code as cleanly as possible on a Sun workstation to remove all errors so that, while compiling on a PC would be slow, it would be less error-prone. This concept informed the idea of a scripting language that would be cross-platform.

SCUMM was developed to be a tool that converted human-readable commands into byte-sized tokens that then would be read by an executable interpreter program that presented the game to the player. For example, the SCUMM command codice_1 would be tokenized to a 4-byte command. They did not want to have specific details about a game hard-coded into the script, so the tokenizer would be able to recognize actors by their name from the script instead of by internal numbers. The only exception was to display a character&#x27;s dialog in a different text color for &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; in which they had to include the number, but this was subsequently revised by the time &quot;Zak McKracken&quot; was released. The scripts included the ability to multitask, such as having background actors enact behavior while waiting for foreground actions to complete. The combined tools enabled for rapid prototyping of a game. Scripters could work with preliminary character and background art drawn by the artists to hone their scripts while providing feedback to the artists.

The SCUMM program was responsible for tokenizing the scripts and gathering all other assets (such as art and sound) as a package. The reusable interpreter was called SPUTM, the &quot;SCUMM Presentation Utility (TM)&quot; which was renamed on shipment of the game to the name of the game&#x27;s executable. SPUTM would interpret the scripts, load assets from disc, and handle the other user interactions with the game. SPUTM was not actually trademarked, but according to Wilmunder, they wanted &quot;to name it after another bodily fluid&quot;. SCUMM was subsequently reused in many later LucasArts adventure games being both updated and rewritten several times. According to Wilmunder, the version of SCUMM for &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; had about 80% of the commands that would end up being used in the later versions of the engine, with most key commands requiring no modification. Other tools and engines were developed alongside SCUMM to aid in development, and named for other body fluids. SPIT was used to manage text fonts on different parts of the screen. FLEM was used to define a specific room, track objects within it, and specify clipping planes for character animation. MMUCAS was used with FLEM to compile a room and its objects into one file that would enable the scripters to make rapid changes without having to recompile the room&#x27;s description. BYLE and subsequently CYST were used for character animations and scaling, the latter used for the more complex art in LucasArts&#x27; later games.

Following his departure from LucasArts and co-founding of Humongous Entertainment in 1992, Gilbert struck a deal with LucasArts which would grant Humongous a license to use the SCUMM engine in the development of their games, on the condition that he continue to develop improvements to the engine for use by both companies. For the game &quot;Full Throttle&quot;, the team worked to integrate SCUMM with the INSANE animation engine that had formerly been developed for &quot;Star Wars: Rebel Assault&quot;. Though Wilmunder had gotten the two systems to work for shipment of &quot;Full Throttle&quot;, the interaction between the two was not always stable, and spent time before &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot; to have SCUMM work atop the INSANE engine, replacing some of the SCUMM engine parts to use that were native to INSANE.

Internally, much of the workings of SCUMM were undocumented, as Wilmunder believed that it was relatively simple to learn, but he changed this approach before &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot;. To train new hires on the engine, Gilbert put them through &quot;SCUMM University&quot;, a week-long period where they were taught how to use the SCUMM engine. These new hires, called &quot;&quot;, then were given the opportunity to explore and expand on example work to help identify where they would best fit into the development team.

LucasArts finally abandoned the SCUMM engine in 1998 when they switched to GrimE, using the free software scripting language Lua, for the games &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; and &quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot;. Humongous Entertainment continued to use the engine for all its PC games, including the &quot;Backyard Sports&quot; series, until the release of &quot;Backyard Soccer 2004&quot; in 2003. Subsequent games would be developed on the Python-based YAGA engine, including &quot;Putt-Putt: Pep&#x27;s Birthday Surprise&quot; and &quot;Pajama Sam: Life Is Rough When You Lose Your Stuff!&quot;, the only Humongous adventure games to not be developed using the SCUMM engine.

In March 2016, Wilmunder revealed that he would share design documents for many of LucasArts&#x27; adventure games and the source code for the SCUMM engine, which he plans to provide in digital format via GitHub.

== Design ==

Most SCUMM games feature a verb–object design paradigm. The player-controlled character has an inventory, and the game world is littered with objects with which the player can interact, using a variety of verbs. A large set of these were often featured at the bottom of the screen in the early games, but by &quot;Full Throttle&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot; (1997) these had been reduced to a &quot;verb coin&quot; appearing at the mouse cursor with the option to use character&#x27;s eyes (to &quot;look&quot;), hands (to &quot;use&quot;, &quot;pick up&quot;, &quot;push&quot;, &quot;pull&quot;, etc.), or mouth (to &quot;talk&quot;, &quot;consume&quot;, &quot;inhale&quot;). Humongous Entertainment&#x27;s games simplified this interface, with a transparent mouse cursor graphic that would become filled in when the player could interact with an object, or transform to an arrow to indicate a clickpoint that will take the player to a new screen.

Puzzles generally involve using the right verb action with the appropriate object—&quot;use biscuit cutter with rubber tree&quot;, for example. &quot;Talk to&quot; commonly produces dialogue sequences, in which the player selects from a list of predefined questions or comments, and the character they are talking to replies with a predefined response. The notable exception to this general paradigm is &quot;Loom&quot; (1990), which does not use the standard verb–object interface, but replaces most actions with a selection of spells played on an instrument.

== Reimplementation ==
=== Compiler ===
ScummC is a set of tools (including a script and a costume compiler, a walkboxes editor, charset, graphics, audio and MIDI tools), able to compile its own JavaScript-like language into SCUMM v6 bytecode, runnable as is in ScummVM. It allows anyone with the needed skills to create new and original SCUMM games, with features on par with &quot;Day of the Tentacle&quot; and &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot;.

A similar project named ScummGEN aims to achieve the same thing, with user-friendly tools.

Scummbler is a compiler for SCUMM bytecode, for versions 3 to 5 of the SCUMM engine. It uses scripts decompiled from the original game files, retrieved using a combination of an unpacking tool like ScummPacker (also by the author of Scummbler), and the &quot;descumm&quot; tool from ScummVM. These scripts can be re-inserted into the original game files, making it useful for modifying existing games, such as for translation. Also available are an image encoder-decoder, and a tool to assist in mapping speech files to text.

=== Interpreters ===
ScummVM is a free and open source software project to make a portable, Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library-based SCUMM-engine client which allows many of the SCUMM-engine games to be played on systems where the original versions will not work or have trouble operating, including modern Windows and Macintosh systems, Linux (including portable handhelds—Android, GP2X, GP2X Wiz, Maemo, etc.), BeOS-Haiku, AmigaOS (3.x, 4.0, and its clones MorphOS and AROS), Palm OS, Windows Mobile (Pocket PC), Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, Wii, Symbian (SeriesXX and UIQ), iOS (iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch), webOS and QNX-Playbook platforms.

 is a SCUMM interpreter developed by the ScummC author. As of April 2008, it is in a prototype state, and is meant to become a script debugger for ScummC development. hiscumm is an attempt to port and some bits of ScummVM to the Haxe platform, to produce an interpreter with an Adobe Flash backend.

== References and in-jokes ==
In-joke references were a common feature of LucasArts adventure games. Developers used the name of their engine for comic effect in several games.

&quot;Razor and the Scummettes&quot;, a punk band mentioned in &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot;, and the &quot;SCUMM bar&quot; in the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; series are both named after the scripting language. In &quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot;, victim of a hostile takeover, the &quot;SCUMM bar&quot; becomes the &quot;Lua bar&quot;, a reference to the programming language which replaced the engine used for the prior games. SCUMM is also listed in the ingredients of grog in &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot;.

<text>Bruce Schneier (; born January 15, 1963) is an American cryptographer, computer security professional, privacy specialist, and writer. Schneier is an Adjunct Lecturer in Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School and a Fellow at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society as of November, 2013. He is a board member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Access Now, and The Tor Project; and an advisory board member of Electronic Privacy Information Center and VerifiedVoting.org. He is the author of several books on general security topics, computer security and cryptography and is a squid enthusiast.
== Early life and education ==
Bruce Schneier is the son of Martin Schneier, a Brooklyn Supreme Court judge. He grew up in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, attending P.S. 139 and Hunter College High School.

After receiving a physics bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Rochester in 1984, he went to American University in Washington, D.C., and got his master&#x27;s degree in computer science in 1988. 

==Career==
In 1991, Schneier was laid off from his job and started writing for computer magazines. Later he decided to write a book on applied cryptography &quot;since no such book existed&quot;. He took his articles, wrote a proposal to John Wiley and they bought the proposal.

In 1994, Schneier published &quot;Applied Cryptography&quot;, which details the design, use, and implementation of cryptographic algorithms.

In 1999, Schneier was a founder and Chief technology officer of Counterpane Internet Security (now BT Managed Security Solutions). 

In 2000, Schneier published &quot;Secrets and Lies: Digital Security in a Networked World&quot;; in 2003, &quot;Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World&quot; and in 2012, &quot;Liars and Outliers: Enabling the Trust that Society Needs to Thrive&#x27;.

As a Fellow of Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University since 2013, Schneier has been exploring the intersection of security, technology, and people, with an emphasis on power.

He worked for IBM when they acquired Resilient Systems in 2016, where he was CTO. until he left at the end of June 2019.

Schneier has been an Adjunct Lecturer in Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School.

==Personal life==
Schneier was married to Karen Cooper in 1997 and lived in Minneapolis; they published restaurant reviews in the Pulse of the Twin Cities. The couple divorced in 2022.

== Viewpoints == 

=== Blockchains ===
Schneier has warned about misplaced trust in blockchain and the lack of use cases, calling blockchain a solution in search of a problem.

He goes on to say that cryptocurrencies are useless and are only used by speculators looking for quick riches.

=== Cryptography ===
To Schneier, peer review and expert analysis are important for the security of cryptographic systems. Mathematical cryptography is usually not the weakest link in a security chain; effective security requires that cryptography be combined with other things.

The term &quot;Schneier&#x27;s law&quot; was coined by Cory Doctorow in a 2004 speech. The law is phrased as:

He attributes this to Bruce Schneier, who wrote in 1998: &quot;Anyone, from the most clueless amateur to the best cryptographer, can create an algorithm that he himself can&#x27;t break. It&#x27;s not even hard. What is hard is creating an algorithm that no one else can break, even after years of analysis.&quot;

Similar sentiments had been expressed by others before. In &quot;The Codebreakers&quot;, David Kahn states: &quot;Few false ideas have more firmly gripped the minds of so many intelligent men than the one that, if they just tried, they could invent a cipher that no one could break&quot;, and in &quot;A Few Words On Secret Writing&quot;, in July 1841, Edgar Allan Poe had stated: &quot;Few persons can be made to believe that it is not quite an easy thing to invent a method of secret writing which shall baffle investigation. Yet it may be roundly asserted that human ingenuity cannot concoct a cipher which human ingenuity cannot resolve.&quot;

Schneier also coined the term &quot;kid sister cryptography&quot;, writing in the Preface to &quot;Applied Cryptography&quot; that:

=== Digital rights management ===
Schneier is critical of digital rights management (DRM) and has said that it allows a vendor to increase lock-in. Proper implementation of control-based security for the user via trusted computing is very difficult, and security is not the same thing as control.

Schneier insists that &quot;owning your data is a different way of thinking about data.&quot;

=== Full disclosure ===
Schneier is a proponent of full disclosure, i.e. making security issues public.

=== Homeland security ===
Schneier has said that homeland security money should be spent on intelligence, investigation, and emergency response. Defending against the broad threat of terrorism is generally better than focusing on specific potential terrorist plots. According to Schneier, analysis of intelligence data is difficult but is one of the better ways to deal with global terrorism. Human intelligence has advantages over automated and computerized analysis, and increasing the amount of intelligence data that is gathered does not help to improve the analysis process. Agencies that were designed around fighting the Cold War may have a culture that inhibits the sharing of information; the practice of sharing information is more important and less of a security threat in itself when dealing with more decentralized and poorly funded adversaries such as al Qaeda.

Regarding PETN—the explosive that has become terrorists&#x27; weapon of choice—Schneier has written that only swabs and dogs can detect it. He also believes that changes to airport security since 11 September 2001 have done more harm than good and he defeated Kip Hawley, former head of the Transportation Security Administration, in an &quot;Economist&quot; online debate by 87% to 13% regarding the issue. He is widely credited with coining the term &quot;security theater&quot; to describe some such changes.

====Movie plot threat====
&quot;Movie-plot threat&quot; is a term Schneier coined that refers to very specific and dramatic terrorist attack scenarios, reminiscent of the behavior of terrorists in movies, rather than what terrorists actually do in the real world. Security measures created to protect against movie plot threats do not provide a higher level of real security, because such preparation only pays off if terrorists choose that one particular avenue of attack, which may not even be feasible. Real-world terrorists would also be likely to notice the highly specific security measures, and simply attack in some other way. The specificity of movie plot threats gives them power in the public imagination, however, so even extremely unrealistic security theater countermeasures may receive strong support from the public and legislators. Among many other examples of movie plot threats, Schneier described banning baby carriers from subways, for fear that they may contain explosives. Starting in April 2006, Schneier has had an annual contest to create the most fantastic movie-plot threat. In 2015, during the 8th and the last one, he mentioned that the contest may have run its course.

=== System design ===
Schneier has criticized security approaches that try to prevent any malicious incursion, instead arguing that designing systems to fail well is more important. The designer of a system should not underestimate the capabilities of an attacker, as technology may make it possible in the future to do things that are not possible at the present. Under Kerckhoffs&#x27;s Principle, the need for one or more parts of a cryptographic system to remain secret increases the fragility of the system; whether details about a system should be obscured depends upon the availability of persons who can make use of the information for beneficial uses versus the potential for attackers to misuse the information.

===Service and awards===
Schneier is a board member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Access Now, and The Tor Project; and an advisory board member of Electronic Privacy Information Center and VerifiedVoting.org.

In 2015, Schneier received the EPIC Lifetime Achievement Award from Electronic Privacy Information Center.

In 2011, he was awarded an honorary Ph.D from the University of Westminster in London, England, by the Department of Electronics and Computer Science in recognition of Schneier&#x27;s &#x27;hard work and contribution to industry and public life&#x27;.

==Work==
===Cryptographic algorithms ===
Schneier has been involved in the creation of many cryptographic algorithms.

Hash functions:
* Skein

Stream ciphers:
* Solitaire
* Phelix
* Helix

Pseudo-random number generators:
* Fortuna
* Yarrow algorithm

Block ciphers:
* Blowfish
* Twofish
* Threefish
* MacGuffin

=== Publications ===
Schneier writes a freely available monthly Internet newsletter on computer and other security issues, &quot;Crypto-Gram&quot;, as well as a security weblog, &quot;Schneier on Security&quot;. The blog focuses on the latest threats, and his own thoughts. The weblog started out as a way to publish essays before they appeared in Crypto-Gram, making it possible for others to comment on them while the stories were still current, but over time the newsletter became a monthly email version of the blog, re-edited and re-organized. 
Schneier is frequently quoted in the press on computer and other security issues, pointing out flaws in security and cryptographic implementations ranging from biometrics to airline security after the September 11 attacks.

<text>Columbia Business School (CBS) is the business school of Columbia University, a private research university in New York City. Established in 1916, Columbia Business School is one of six Ivy League business schools, a member of the M7 business schools, and one of the oldest business schools in the world.

==History==
The school was founded in 1916 with 11 full-time faculty members and an inaugural class of 61 students, including 8 women. Banking executive Emerson McMillin provided initial funding in 1916, while A. Barton Hepburn, then president of Chase National Bank, provided funding for the school&#x27;s endowment in 1919. The school expanded rapidly, enrolling 420 students by 1920, and in 1924 added a PhD program to the existing BS and MS degree programs.

In 1945, Columbia Business School authorized the awarding of the MBA degree. Shortly thereafter, in the 1950s, the school adopted the Hermes emblem as its symbol, reflecting the entrepreneurial nature of the Greek god Hermes and his association with business, commerce, and communication.

In 1952, CBS admitted its last class of undergraduates. The school currently offers executive education programs that culminate in a Certificate in Business Excellence (CIBE) and full alumni status, and several degree programs for the MBA and PhD degrees. In addition to the full-time MBA, the school offers four Executive MBA programs: the NY-EMBA Friday/Saturday program, the EMBA-Global program (launched in 2001 in conjunction with the London Business School), the EMBA-Americas program launched in 2012, and the EMBA-Global Asia program (launched in 2009 in conjunction with the London Business School and the University of Hong Kong Business School). Students in jointly run programs earn an MBA degree from each of the cooperating institutions.

In 2004, economist R. Glenn Hubbard became Columbia Business School&#x27;s eleventh dean. He was succeeded in 2019 by Costis Maglaras.

==Campus==
From 1961, Columbia Business School was primarily located housed in Uris Hall, at the center of Columbia&#x27;s Morningside Heights campus.

In October 2010, Columbia Business School announced that alumnus Henry Kravis, the billionaire co-founder of private-equity firm KKR, pledged $100 million to fund an expansion of Columbia Business School, the largest gift in its history. The donation went toward construction of the business school&#x27;s new site on Columbia&#x27;s Manhattanville campus. In December 2012, Ronald Perelman also donated $100 million to the construction of the second business school building. In September 2021, David Geffen pledged $75 million to support the new campus&#x27; construction. The buildings are designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro, and are named Henry R. Kravis Hall and David Geffen Hall, respectively. Columbia Business School officially moved to Manhattanville in January 2022.

The cost of the new campus, which stands at $600 million, makes it the most expensive business school ever built.

==MBA program==

The Columbia MBA Program is one of the most competitive in the world with an admission rate of 13.6% for the Class of 2021. Students in the class that entered in 2009 come from 61 countries and speak more than 50 languages.

The revised core curriculum, launched in the fall of 2008, represents about 40% of the degree requirement. It consists of 2 full courses and 12 half-term courses including Corporate Finance, Financial Accounting, Managerial Statistics, Managerial Economics, Leadership, Operations Management, and Marketing Strategy. While the first year of the program is usually devoted to completing the requirements of the core curriculum, the second year provides students with the opportunity to choose from the more than 130 elective courses available at the school and supplement them with more than 4,000 graduate-level classes from the university&#x27;s other graduate and professional schools. Among the most popular electives at Columbia Business School are the Economics of Strategic Behavior, Financial Statement Analysis and Earnings Quality, Launching New Ventures, Modern Political Economy, and the Seminar in Value Investing.

Columbia Business School has a firm grade non-disclosure policy, which states that students may refrain from disclosing specific class grades, GPAs, or transcripts until they accept full-time, post graduation positions.

Students enter Columbia&#x27;s MBA program in two tracks. The traditional fall term is approximately 550 students, while the January term &quot;J-Term&quot; is approximately 200 students. Students entering in the fall are divided into eight clusters of approximately 65 students that take all first year core classes together. J-Term students are broken into three clusters.

The January-entry is similar to the August-entry option. January-entry students attend orientation in the spring, while August-entry students are beginning their second terms, and finish their core courses over the summer, while August-entry students participate in summer internships. In the fall of the second year, the two tracks become one, and all MBA students choose from the same pool of electives, gain access to the same career management resources, lead the same clubs, and graduate as a single class. The January-entry has a higher admissions rate than the traditional fall term, making the fall term more selective. 

The average starting base salary and bonus for Columbia MBAs in 2020 was $171,436, a sum that places it as the 6th highest among business schools. According to &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, 90% of billionaires with MBAs who derived their fortunes from finance obtained their master&#x27;s degree from one of three schools: Harvard Business School, Columbia Business School, or The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.

===Academic divisions===
The school&#x27;s faculty are divided into six academic units:
*Accounting
*Decision, Risk, and Operations
*Finance
*Management
*Economics
*Marketing
===MBA rankings===
Recent national rankings of Columbia&#x27;s MBA program include 7th by &quot;Forbes&quot;, 5th by &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot;, and 6th by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. In global rankings, Columbia was ranked No. 4 by &quot;The Economist&quot; in 2022 and No. 1 by the &quot;Financial Times&quot; in 2023.

===Dual-degree programs===
Columbia Business School students can combine an MBA with one of ten other professional degrees. In general, a dual degree requires one less year than it would take to complete the two degrees separately. Candidates must apply separately to Columbia Business School and the other degree program.

Dual degrees offered with the following schools include:
* School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation
* College of Dental Medicine
* School of Engineering and Applied Science
* School of International and Public Affairs
* School of Journalism
* School of Law
* School of Nursing
* College of Physicians and Surgeons
* School of Public Health
* School of Social Work
=== Student life ===
The Columbia Business School Follies is a student club that works throughout each semester to put together a production in which students write, choreograph, and perform comedy skits. It achieved notoriety in 2006 for &quot;Every Breath Bernanke Takes&quot;, its video parody of the Police song &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot;. It purports to be from Glenn Hubbard, Dean of the Business School, in response to Hubbard&#x27;s being a runner-up to the Fed Chairmanship assumed by Ben Bernanke.

==Executive MBA programs==
Columbia offers various executive MBA programs.

The Executive MBA (EMBA) Friday/Saturday Program is a 20-month graduate program designed for individuals that are looking to enhance their education without interrupting their careers. The EMBA program is taught on campus at Columbia University by full-time faculty. The first year of classes consists of the same core curriculum as the Full-Time MBA program. Executive education is the focus of the second year. This Friday/Saturday program is targeted at individuals with approximately 10 years of work experience.

The Executive MBA (EMBA) Saturday Program is a 24-month graduate degree program designed for individuals that are looking to enhance their education, but cannot take any time away from work. This program is the same as the Friday/Saturday program, with the exception that classes only meet on Saturdays over a longer period of time.

In addition to the New York-based EMBA Program, Columbia offers three partner programs to meet the differing needs and geographical distribution of prospective students. Because students in the partner EMBA programs must satisfy the separate requirements of each school, they earn an MBA degree from each participating university. Likewise, they become alumni of each university and business school and may avail themselves of all programs and privileges afforded to alumni.

*The EMBA-Global Americas &amp; Europe program is a 20-month program administered in partnership with the London Business School. The program enrolls approximately 70 students from around the world per year. Courses are taught by the full-time faculty of both schools. During the first year, the core curriculum classes alternate monthly between the campuses of Columbia University and the London Business School. The core curriculum is similar to that offered in the regular EMBA programs offered separately by each school, but with a more transnational-business emphasis. Second year classes may be selected from the portfolio of EMBA classes offered at either or both partner schools.
*The EMBA-Global Asia, run jointly with the London Business School and the University of Hong Kong. This 20-month program follows a curriculum similar to the EMBA-Global program. Classes are held in Hong Kong, London, New York, and Shanghai.

===EMBA rankings===
* No. 2 worldwide, No. 2 US program, &quot;BusinessWeek&quot;, 2011 Executive MBA Rankings
* No. 2 worldwide, &quot;Financial Times&quot;, 2010 Executive MBA Rankings, Global-EMBA program
* No. 3 US Program, No. 13 worldwide. &quot;Financial Times&quot;, 2010 Executive MBA Rankings, Berkeley-Columbia program

* No. 4 &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; Executive MBA Rankings, NY-EMBA program
* No. 9 &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; Executive MBA Rankings, 2010, NY-EMBA program

==MS Programs==
Columbia Business School offers three separate Master of Science degrees in Accounting and Fundamental Analysis, Financial Economics and Marketing Science. Admission to the programs is extremely competitive: in 2021, there were 837 applicants to the Financial Economics program and only 20 students were accepted.

==Doctoral program==
The degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) is offered by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and is administered by the Business School. Admission is highly competitive with 894 applicants in 2010 for positions in an entering class of 18 students (2%). In 2021, the Finance division received over 500 applications and admitted 3 students (Acceptance rate of 0.6%) A PhD in Management or Business is a common precursor to an academic career in business schools.

==Executive education==
Columbia Business School Executive Education offers custom non-degree programs for organizations and open-enrollment non-degree programs for individuals in topics including management, finance, leadership, marketing, social enterprise, and strategy. The school also offers executive certification programs, including the Advanced Management Program, the Certificate in Business Excellence and the Senior Leaders Program for Nonprofit Professionals.

==CIBE==
The Certificate in Business Excellence (CIBE) is awarded to students who complete a total of 18 program days of executive education within a four-year period. Any executive education program at Columbia Business School can be applied toward the completion of the certificate.
