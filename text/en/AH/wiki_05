<text>Williams Racing, legally known as Williams Grand Prix Engineering Limited and competing as Atlassian Williams Racing, is a British Formula One team and constructor. It was founded by Frank Williams (1942–2021) and Patrick Head. The team was formed in after Frank Williams&#x27;s earlier unsuccessful F1 operation, Frank Williams Racing Cars (which later became Wolf–Williams Racing in 1976). The team is based in Grove, Oxfordshire, on a site.

The team&#x27;s first race was the 1977 Spanish Grand Prix, where the new team ran a March chassis for Patrick Nève. Williams started manufacturing its own cars the following year, and Clay Regazzoni won Williams&#x27;s first race at the 1979 British Grand Prix. At the 1997 British Grand Prix, Jacques Villeneuve scored the team&#x27;s 100th race victory, making Williams one of only five teams in Formula One, alongside Ferrari, McLaren, Mercedes, and Red Bull Racing to win 100 races. Williams won nine Constructors&#x27; Championships between and . This was a record until Ferrari won its tenth championship in .

Notable drivers for Williams include: Alan Jones, Keke Rosberg, Nigel Mansell, Damon Hill, David Coulthard, Jenson Button, Juan Pablo Montoya, Alain Prost, Nelson Piquet, Ayrton Senna, Riccardo Patrese, Valtteri Bottas, Carlos Reutemann, Felipe Massa and Jacques Villeneuve. Of these drivers, Jones, Rosberg, Mansell, Hill, Piquet, Prost, and Villeneuve won the Drivers&#x27; title with the team. Of those who have won the championship with Williams, only Jones, Rosberg and Villeneuve defended their title while still with the team; as Piquet moved to Lotus after winning the championship; Mansell left F1 to compete in the CART series after winning the championship, Prost retired after winning the championship, and Hill moved to Arrows after winning the championship. None of Williams&#x27;s Drivers&#x27; Champions went on to win another championship after their success with Williams.

Williams have worked with many engine manufacturers, most successfully with Renault, winning five of their nine Constructors&#x27; titles with the company. Along with Ferrari, McLaren, Benetton and Renault, Williams is one of a group of five teams that won every Constructors&#x27; Championship between 1979 and 2008 and every Drivers&#x27; Championship from 1984 to 2008. Williams also has business interests beyond Formula One. They have established Williams Advanced Engineering and Williams Hybrid Power, who take technology originally developed for Formula One and adapt it for commercial applications. In April 2014, Williams Hybrid Power was sold to GKN. In May 2020, Williams announced they were seeking buyers for a portion of the team due to poor financial performance in 2019 and that they had terminated the contract of title sponsor ROKiT. On 21 August 2020, Williams was acquired by Dorilton Capital. Frank and Claire Williams stepped down from being Manager and Deputy Manager of the team on 6 September 2020, with the 2020 Italian Grand Prix being their last time in their respective positions.

==Origins==


Frank Williams founded Williams in 1977 after his previous team, Frank Williams Racing Cars, failed to achieve the success he desired. Despite the promise of a new owner, Canadian millionaire Walter Wolf, and the team&#x27;s rebranding as Wolf–Williams Racing in , the cars still were not competitive. Eventually, Williams left the rechristened Walter Wolf Racing and moved to Didcot, Oxfordshire to rebuild his team as Williams Grand Prix Engineering. Frank recruited Patrick Head to work for the team, creating the Williams–Head partnership.

==Racing history – Formula One==
===Ford-Cosworth engines (1977–1983)===

====1977 season====
Williams entered a March 761 for the season. Lone driver Patrick Nève competed in 11 races that year, starting with the . The new team failed to score a point, achieving a best finish of 7th at the .

====1978 season====
For the season, Patrick Head designed the first Williams car: the FW06. Williams signed Alan Jones, who had won the the previous season for a devastated Shadow team following the death of their lead driver, Tom Pryce. Jones&#x27;s first race for the team was the where he qualified in 14th position but retired after 36 laps due to a fuel system failure. The team scored its first championship points two races later at the when Jones finished in fourth. Williams earnt their first podium at the , where Jones came second, 20 seconds behind the Ferrari of Carlos Reutemann. Williams finished the season in ninth place in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, with a respectable 11 points, while Alan Jones finished 11th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Towards the end of 1978, Frank Williams recruited Frank Dernie to join Patrick Head in the design office.

====1979 season====
Head designed the FW07 chassis and gearbox for the season with Frank Dernie picking up the suspension, aerodynamic development and skirt design. This was the team&#x27;s first ground effect car, a technology that was first introduced by Colin Chapman and Team Lotus. Williams also obtained membership of the Formula One Constructors&#x27; Association (FOCA) which expressed a preference for teams to run two cars, so Jones was joined at the team by Clay Regazzoni. It was not until the seventh round of the championship, the , that they finished in the points. Regazzoni came close to taking the team&#x27;s first win but finished second, less than a second behind race winner Jody Scheckter. The next race, the French Grand Prix, is remembered for the final lap battle between René Arnoux and Gilles Villeneuve, but also saw both cars finish in the points for the first time; as Jones was fourth with Regazzoni in sixth. The team&#x27;s first win came at the (their home Grand Prix) when Regazzoni finished 25 seconds ahead of second place.

Greater success followed when Williams got a 1-2 finish at the next round in Germany, Jones in first with Regazzoni two seconds behind in second. Jones then made it three wins in a row at the Austrian Grand Prix, finishing half a minute ahead of Gilles Villeneuve&#x27;s Ferrari. Three wins in a row became four two weeks later at the Dutch Grand Prix, with Alan Jones winning yet again by a comfortable margin over Jody Scheckter&#x27;s Ferrari. Scheckter ended Williams&#x27;s winning streak when he won the ; with Regazzoni finishing third behind Scheckter and Villeneuve. Alan Jones managed another win at the penultimate race in Canada to cap off a great season.

Williams had greatly improved their Constructors&#x27; Championship position, finishing eight places higher than the previous year and scoring 59 more points. Alan Jones was the closest driver to the Ferrari duo of Villeneuve and 1979 champion Jody Scheckter. Jones scored 43 points, 17 points behind Scheckter, while Regazzoni was two places behind him with 32 points.
====1980 season====
Before the start of the 1980 season, Regazzoni left the team. So, Carlos Reutemann joined the team. Williams started strong in the championship, with Jones winning the first race of the season in Argentina. Jones won four more races: the French Grand Prix, the British Grand Prix, the Canadian Grand Prix and, the last race of the season, the United States Grand Prix. Jones became the first of seven Williams drivers to win the Drivers&#x27; Championship, 17 points ahead of Nelson Piquet&#x27;s Brabham. Williams also won its first Constructors&#x27; Championship, scoring 120 points, almost twice as many as second-placed Ligier.

====1981 season====
Williams won four races in . Alan Jones won the first race of the season, the United States West Grand Prix, and the final race of the season, the Caesars Palace Grand Prix. Meanwhile, Carlos Reutemann won the Brazilian Grand Prix and the Belgian Grand Prix. Williams won the Constructors&#x27; title for the second year in a row, scoring 95 points, 34 points more than second-placed Brabham.

====1982 season====
This season, Alan Jones retired from Formula One (though he would come back a year later for a single race with the Arrows team). The Australian was replaced by Keke Rosberg, the father of 2016 World Champion Nico Rosberg. Rosberg had not scored a single point the previous year. He won the Drivers&#x27; title that year despite winning only one race, the . Rosberg&#x27;s teammate, Reutemann, finished in 15th place having quit Formula One after just two races of the new season. His seat was filled by Mario Andretti for the United States Grand Prix West; before Derek Daly took over for the rest of the year. Williams finished fourth in the Constructors&#x27; Championship that year, 16 points behind first-place Ferrari.

===Honda engines (1983–1987)===
====1983 season====
Frank Williams looked towards Honda, who was developing a turbocharged V6 engine with Spirit. A deal between Honda and Williams was settled early in 1983 and the team used the engines for the 1984 season. For the season however, Williams continued to use the Ford engine except for the last race of the year in South Africa; where Keke Rosberg finished in an impressive fifth place. The team finished fourth in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, scoring 36 points. Also, Rosberg won that year&#x27;s .

====1984 season====
For the season, the team ran an FW09. Keke Rosberg won the Dallas Grand Prix and finished in second at the opening race in Brazil. Rosberg&#x27;s new teammate, Jacques Laffite, came 14th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with five points. The team finished sixth in the Constructors&#x27; with 25.5 points, with Rosberg finishing in eighth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

====1985 season====

In , Head designed the FW10, the team&#x27;s first chassis to employ the carbon-fibre composite technology pioneered by McLaren. Nigel Mansell replaced Laffite to partner with Rosberg. Dernie produced another competitive aerodynamic package. The team scored four wins with Rosberg winning the Detroit and Australian Grands Prix, and Mansell won the and the . Williams finished in third in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, scoring 71 points.

During qualifying for the , Rosberg completed a lap of the circuit in 1:05.591. The lap&#x27;s average speed was . This was the fastest recorded lap in Formula One history to that point.

From 1985 until 1993, Williams ran their famous yellow, blue and white Canon livery.

====1986 season====
In March 1986, Frank Williams faced the most serious challenge of his life. While returning to the airport at Nice, France, after pre-season testing, he was involved in a road accident that left him paralysed. He did not return to the pit lane for almost a year. Despite the lack of his trackside presence, the Williams team won nine Grands Prix and the Constructors&#x27; Championship and came close to winning the Drivers&#x27; Championship with Nigel Mansell, but the British driver&#x27;s left-rear tyre blew at the , the final race of the season, while his fellow championship rival and new teammate, Nelson Piquet made a pitstop shortly after Mansell&#x27;s retirement as a precaution. This left Alain Prost to defend his title successfully, despite being in a slower car.

====1987 season====
The season brought the Williams-Honda partnership its first and only Drivers&#x27; Championship title in the hands of Nelson Piquet. Piquet won three races and scored 73 points in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. His teammate Mansell came in second place with six victories and 61 points. Williams won the Constructors&#x27; Championship for the second year in a row, scoring 137 points, 61 points ahead of their nearest rivals, McLaren. Despite this success, Honda ended their partnership with Williams at the end of the year in favour of McLaren.

===Judd engines (1988)===
====1988 season====
Unable to make a deal with another major engine manufacturer, Williams used naturally aspirated Judd engines for the season. This left them with a significant performance deficit compared with their turbo-powered rivals. Piquet left Williams to join Lotus who had retained their Honda engines for the 1988 season, helped by having Satoru Nakajima as number 2 driver to Piquet. Nelson Piquet called Frank Dernie every week to persuade him to join Lotus. Eventually Dernie moved to Lotus to become their new Technical Director. Williams brought in Riccardo Patrese to replace Piquet. The team did not win a race that season and finished seventh in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, scoring 20 points. The highlights of the season for the team were two second-place finishes by Mansell. When Mansell was forced to miss two races due to illness, he was replaced by Martin Brundle for Belgium and Jean-Louis Schlesser for Italy. Schlesser&#x27;s collision with Ayrton Senna in that race would deny McLaren a clean sweep of race wins that season.

===Renault engines (1989–1997)===
The team secured Renault as their engine supplier in 1989. Renault engines subsequently powered Williams&#x27;s drivers to another four Drivers&#x27; and five Constructors&#x27; Championships up until Renault&#x27;s departure from Formula One at the end of 1997. The team brought in Adrian Newey to replace Frank Dernie. The combination of Renault&#x27;s powerful engine and Adrian Newey&#x27;s designing expertise led to the team dominating the sport in the mid-1990s alongside McLaren. Mansell had a record-breaking 1992 season, winning the title in record time and leading numerous races from pole to finish.

====1989 season====

The Renault era started in , with Riccardo Patrese and Thierry Boutsen at the helm of the two Williams cars. Boutsen replaced Mansell, who had signed a contract with Ferrari. The engine&#x27;s first Grand Prix in Brazil was one that the team would prefer to forget: Boutsen retired with an engine failure and Patrese with an alternator failure. Williams managed to get back on track with Boutsen finishing in fourth at the next race in Italy; winning the team three points. Two races later at the Mexican Grand Prix, the team managed to achieve their first podium with the Renault engine, as Patrese finished second, 15 seconds behind Ayrton Senna in first. The next race saw Patrese finish second again, having started from 14th on the grid, with Boutsen finishing in 6th. At the sixth round in Canada, Williams not only scored their first win with the Renault engine but also their first one-two: with Boutsen finishing in first followed by Patrese in second. This won the team 15 points. Williams came second in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, scoring 77 points, 64 points behind McLaren. Patrese finished 3rd in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 40 points, 41 points behind first-placed Alain Prost. Boutsen finished 5th in the championship with 37 points after also winning in Australia. Boutsen&#x27;s win gave Williams the distinction of having won both the first and last Grand Prix of the 1980s.

====1990 season====
In the season, Williams kept Patrese and Boutsen as the team&#x27;s drivers. The team scored 20 fewer points than the previous year and finished fourth in the Constructors&#x27; Championship two positions lower than in 1989. In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Boutsen finished sixth with 34 points and Patrese in seventh with 23 points.

====1991 season====

Boutsen left Williams and joined Ligier at the start of the season. Replacing him was a returning Nigel Mansell, who was talked out of retirement by Frank Williams himself following two tumultuous seasons at Ferrari. Williams also recruited future 1996 world champion, Damon Hill, as their reserve driver. Williams failed to finish the first Grand Prix of the season, the US Grand Prix, with both drivers retiring due to gearbox problems. Patrese got back on track for the team in the next Grand Prix at Interlagos, coming second behind McLaren&#x27;s Ayrton Senna. The 1991 San Marino Grand Prix saw both cars retiring yet again: with Mansell crashing and Patrese suffering from an electrical failure. The Monaco Grand Prix saw Mansell finish in the points, coming in second. At the next race, the Canadian Grand Prix, Williams locked out the front row only for Patrese to drop back with gearbox problems and Mansell to retire from the lead on the final lap due to an electrical fault. At the following race in Mexico, Williams achieved a 1–2 finish, with Patrese finishing in first and Mansell finishing in second. Williams then ran a streak of victories, with Mansell winning the French Grand Prix, five seconds ahead of Alain Prost&#x27;s Ferrari. Mansell then won again at the British Grand Prix; it had been four years since a Briton had won the Grand Prix, Mansell having won it in 1987. Three consecutive victories became four when Mansell won again in Germany, with Patrese about 10 seconds behind him in second place. Senna ended Williams&#x27;s run of victories by winning in Hungary, finishing five seconds ahead of Mansell. Mansell later won the Italian Grand Prix and the Spanish Grand Prix, while Patrese won the Portuguese Grand Prix after Mansell&#x27;s race was ruined by a botched pitstop in which only three wheel nuts were fitted. Williams finished second in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, scoring 125 points in total, 14 points behind McLaren. Mansell finished second in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 72 points, 24 points behind Senna.

====1992 season====
Williams took a step up for the season, keeping their driver line-up of Patrese and Mansell. Mansell dominated the first round in South Africa, qualifying in pole position and winning the race by 24 seconds from his teammate, Patrese. Nigel Mansell won the next four rounds for Williams, at Mexico City, Interlagos, Catalunya and Imola, Patrese coming second in all but one (the Spanish Grand Prix at Catalunya, where he retired after spinning off). Mansell&#x27;s five victories in the opening five races was a new record in Formula One. Senna won the next race in Monaco, ahead of both Williams cars, which finished second and third. In the next race, in Canada, both Williams cars retired: Mansell spun off on entering the final corner (he claimed that Senna pushed him off) and Patrese had a gearbox failure. Mansell went on to record four more Grand Prix wins, including at the British Grand Prix. (In the final round, in Adelaide, the two Williams cars again retired, Mansell after Senna violently crashed into the back of him, and Patrese with electrical problems.) Williams won the Constructors&#x27; Championship with 164 points, 65 points more than second-place McLaren. Mansell became World Champion, scoring 108 points, with Patrese finishing second with 56 points. Placing first in nine races, Mansell had set a new record for the most wins by a single driver in one year. Despite this, there looked to be significant upheaval at Williams for 1993; what followed led to a domino effect that had not only effects on the World Championship, but also the CART-sanctioned PPG IndyCar Series.

=====1992 off-season=====
Williams was interested in signing Alain Prost to drive one of its two cars for 1993 as he was returning from his year long sabbatical after being sacked by Scuderia Ferrari during the 1991 World Championship. Patrese, perhaps figuring that he would be the driver being sacked in order for Prost to take one of the two available rides, decided to leave after driving for Williams since 1987. He would join up with Benetton, where he would replace Martin Brundle alongside Michael Schumacher in the team&#x27;s Camel-backed Fords.

Mansell, meanwhile, was not pleased that Williams was looking to bring Prost aboard. Prost had joined Ferrari alongside Mansell, replacing Gerhard Berger, for the 1990 World Championship after his run of success with McLaren, and the two drivers&#x27; relationship (or lack thereof) played a large part in Mansell&#x27;s previously mentioned decision to leave F1 before Williams stepped in. Unwilling to serve as Prost&#x27;s teammate for another year, Mansell joined the CART IndyCar Series for 1993; he replaced Michael Andretti, son of and teammate to Mario Andretti, at Newman/Haas Racing.

Michael Andretti, meanwhile, would be making the jump to F1 for 1993 and signed to drive for McLaren filling the seat held by Berger. He entered a team that was in flux, as there were questions as to who else would be driving for the team and what engines they would be running. Honda, the team&#x27;s longtime supplier, left the World Championship following the season. Coinciding with this was the fact that Ayrton Senna&#x27;s contract was due for renewal, and he was not sure he was going to stay. After McLaren was unable to procure a supply of Renault engines, Senna decided to explore other options; he approached Williams with an offer to take the seat Mansell was vacating, claiming he would forgo collecting a salary for the opportunity. 

However, as with Mansell, there were lingering bad feelings between Prost and Senna from their championship chasing years at McLaren. Prost would sign a two year contract for Williams, which included a veto power clause for the 1993 season; he exercised that clause and froze Senna out of driving for Williams. Senna returned to McLaren where he ran Ford engines. Williams in turn opted not to pursue Berger, who returned to Ferrari, or Brundle, who signed with Ligier; instead, test driver Damon Hill was promoted to pair with Prost.

====1993 season====
The Williams FW15C was an extremely dominant car, with active suspension and traction control systems beyond anything available to the other teams. Prost won on his debut for the team in South Africa and, like Mansell, dominated the weekend, taking pole position and finishing a minute ahead of Senna, who was second. The next Grand Prix in Brazil saw Prost collide with Christian Fittipaldi&#x27;s Minardi in the rain on lap 29, while Hill went on to his first podium finish: second, 16 seconds behind Senna. Prost won three of the next four Grands Prix for Williams, Senna winning the other race. Prost and Hill later scored a 1–2 in France: the only 1–2 of the season for Williams. Prost won the next two Grands Prix at Silverstone and Hockenheim. Hill proved competitive especially in the second half of the season. Mechanical problems cost Hill leads in Britain and Germany, but he went on to win the next three Grands Prix at Hungary, Belgium and Italy which moved him to second in the standings, as well as giving him a chance of taking the Drivers&#x27; title. After Italy, Williams would not win a Grand Prix for the rest of the season, as a young Michael Schumacher won the following race in Portugal, and Senna took Japan and Australia to overtake Hill in the points. Williams retained their Constructors&#x27; title, 84 points ahead of second-placed McLaren. Prost clinched the Drivers&#x27; Championship in Portugal and finished the season 26 points ahead of second-placed Senna.

Based on his victory in the 1992 World Championship, Mansell would have been issued car number 1 for the 1993 season, and his teammate issued number 2. However, Mansell&#x27;s move to the IndyCar series meant that number 1 was not issued; instead, the team was issued the number 0, which was placed on Hill&#x27;s car, while Prost was issued number 2.

1993 marked the final season that Williams ran with Canon as its primary backer.

====1994 season====

During the season, Williams used FW16 (developed during the pre-season) and FW16B (with shorter sidepods and optimised for the revised floor regulations which were introduced during the season).

After Canon left the team Williams signed a contract with tobacco company Rothmans International for , and their namesake brand became its primary sponsor from 1994 to .

Despite Prost&#x27;s continued unwillingness to have his former McLaren teammate run with him, pressure from various sources including the team&#x27;s new sponsor led Williams to agree to terms with Ayrton Senna for 1994. The veto power in Prost&#x27;s contract was only in effect for the 1993 season, and since Williams was now free to do as it desired and that Senna was again a free agent, the team decided it would bring in the multi-time former champion. To appease Prost, who decided to retire from racing permanently after Senna&#x27;s signing, Williams agreed to pay him his full salary for the second half of the contract.

Given this was the same team that had won the previous two World Championships with vastly superior cars, Senna was a natural and presumptive pre-season title favourite, with second-year driver Damon Hill intended to play the supporting role. Between them, Prost, Senna, and Hill had won every race in 1993 but one, which was taken by Benetton&#x27;s Michael Schumacher.

As with 1993, Williams&#x27;s cars were issued numbers 0 and 2, following Prost&#x27;s victory in the 1993 championship and subsequent retirement. Hill retained the number 0, while Senna&#x27;s car was issued number 2.

Pre-season testing showed the FW16 had speed but was difficult to drive. The Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) had banned electronic driver&#x27;s aids, such as active suspension, traction control and ABS, to make the sport more &quot;human&quot;. It was these technological advancements that the Williams chassis of the previous years had been built around. With their removal in 1994, Williams had not been a good-handling car, as observed by other F1 drivers, having been seen to be very loose at the rear. Senna himself had made numerous comments that the Williams FW16 had quirks that needed to be ironed out. It was obvious that the FW16, after the regulation changes banning active suspension and traction control, exhibited none of the superiority of the FW15C and Williams FW14B cars that had preceded it. The surprise of testing was Benetton-Ford which was less powerful but more nimble than the Williams.

The first four rounds were won by Michael Schumacher in the Benetton-Ford. Senna took pole in the first two races but failed to finish either of them. In the third race, the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix in Imola, Senna again took pole position, but was involved in a fatal crash at the second corner after completing six laps. The repercussions of Senna&#x27;s fatal accident were severe for the team itself, as the Italian prosecutors tried to charge the team and Frank Williams with manslaughter, an episode which was not over until 2005. At the next race in Monaco, Damon Hill was the only Williams on the grid, as a mark of respect to Senna, and retired on the first lap. After Senna&#x27;s death, every Williams F1 car carried a Senna &#x27;s&#x27; on its livery in his honour and to symbolise the team&#x27;s ongoing support of the Instituto Ayrton Senna until the permanent removal starting in 2022, with then Williams CEO Jost Capito stating it was time to &quot;move on&quot;.

At the next race in Spain, Williams brought in test driver David Coulthard as Hill&#x27;s new teammate. Hill took the team&#x27;s first victory of the season, by almost half a minute over Schumacher&#x27;s Benetton, while Coulthard would retire due to an electrical problem. In Montreal, both Williams cars finished in the points for the first time that season, with Hill finishing second and Coulthard finishing fifth. In France, Nigel Mansell replaced Coulthard (in the first of four appearances), at the behest of Renault. At Silverstone, Damon Hill accomplished what had eluded his father, twice Formula One World Champion Graham Hill, by winning the British Grand Prix. Hill closed the points gap with Schumacher, who was disqualified from first at Spa after the Stewards found floorboard irregularities on his Benetton. He was banned for the next two races, and Hill capitalised on this with wins in Italy and a Williams 1–2 in Portugal.

With three races left, 1992 champion Nigel Mansell returned from CART (where the season had concluded) to replace Coulthard for the remainder of the season. Mansell would get approximately £900,000 &quot;per race&quot;, while Hill was paid £300,000 for the entire season, though Hill remained as lead driver.

Schumacher came back after his suspension for the European Grand Prix, which he won by about 25 seconds, to take a lead of 5 points into the penultimate round in Japan. The race in Japan was held in torrential rain, with Hill managing to win the restarted race by three seconds on aggregate over Schumacher who finished second. Going into the final round at Adelaide, Schumacher led Hill by a single point. Mansell took pole for Williams but had a poor start which let Hill and Schumacher through to fight for the lead and the 1994 title. Midway through the race, Schumacher&#x27;s perceived need for a low downforce setup cost him, as he lost control and clipped the outside wall at the 5th corner (out of sight of Hill). As Schumacher recovered, Hill came around the corner and attempted to overtake into the next corner. Schumacher turned in and the resulting contact (Schumacher in the wall and Hill retiring with bent suspension) meant that Schumacher was the champion. This collision has been controversial with some, such as Williams&#x27;s Patrick Head, have suggesting that this was a deliberate attempt by Schumacher to take Hill out of the race. Others, such as then BBC commentator Murray Walker, defended Schumacher, calling the accident a &quot;racing incident&quot;. Meanwhile, Nigel Mansell won the last Grand Prix of his career here, driving the second Williams car.

Williams would end the season as Constructors&#x27; Champion for the third consecutive year, scoring 118 points, while Hill finished second in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 91 points.

====1995 season====
In , Nigel Mansell was not retained, Williams favouring Coulthard over him to partner Hill. Schumacher, whose Benetton team had switched engine suppliers from Ford to Renault in the off-season, won the first round in Brazil, with Coulthard taking second. However, both were disqualified from the race after it was found that Elf supplied their teams with a type of fuel for which samples had not been provided to the FIA. Thus, Gerhard Berger and Ferrari were declared winners. Schumacher and Coulthard had their positions reinstated after appeal, though Benetton and Williams were not awarded their Constructors&#x27; points. Hill won the next two races in Argentina and San Marino and would later win races at The Hungaroring and in Adelaide. Hill won two laps ahead of the field at Adelaide in one of F1&#x27;s most dominating victories. Coulthard recorded his only 1995 win for the Williams team at Estoril, before moving to McLaren.

Williams&#x27;s champion streak was ended by Benetton, who elected to switch engine suppliers from Ford to Renault, the same as Williams. As such, Benetton outscored Williams by 29 points in the Constructors&#x27; Championship. Damon Hill placed second in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, 33 points behind Benetton&#x27;s Michael Schumacher.

====1996 season====

For , Williams had the quickest and most reliable car, the FW18. Coulthard had left Williams to join Mika Häkkinen at McLaren, and Williams replaced him with Canadian Jacques Villeneuve, who had won the CART series title in 1995, while Hill remained with the team. Schumacher left Benetton to join Ferrari. Williams won the first five Grands Prix, Hill winning all but one of them. Olivier Panis would take victory at the sixth round in Monaco after both Williams cars retired. Hill would retire for the second time in a row after he spun-off in Spain, while his teammate, Villeneuve, took third place. Hill and Villeneuve dominated the next Grand Prix in Canada, with a 1–2 in qualifying and a 1–2 finish. Williams made it a second 1–2 after Hill won the French Grand Prix. Villeneuve won his second race in F1 at Silverstone after Hill retired with a wheel bearing failure on lap 26. Hill was victorious in the next Grand Prix in Germany while Villeneuve won the race after that in Hungary. Schumacher&#x27;s Ferrari would then take the next two Grands Prix at Spa-Francorchamps and Monza. Villeneuve mounted a title challenge going into the final race of the season at Japan, but Hill reasserted his dominance to take the race and the 1996 title, while Villeneuve lost a wheel and retired.

Williams&#x27;s dominance was such that they had clinched the Constructors&#x27; Championship and only their drivers had a mathematical chance of taking the title, several races before the season concluded. Around that time, Frank Williams announced that Hill would not be re-signed after his contract expired, despite Hill&#x27;s successes and eventual Drivers&#x27; Championship, so he joined Arrows for 1997. Adrian Newey had ambitions as a technical director (rather than just chief designer), but this was not possible at Williams, as Patrick Head was a founder and shareholder of the team. McLaren lured Newey away, though he was forced to take garden leave for the majority of 1997.

In the middle of the 1996 season, Williams moved from its longtime Didcot headquarters to Grove, 15 kilometers away. Before the move, the racing press occasionally referred to Williams as &quot;the Didcot team.&quot;

====1997 season====
For what would be the final season of Williams-Renault and a car designed with Newey&#x27;s input, Frank Williams brought in German Heinz-Harald Frentzen, who had created a good impression on Williams during his first few seasons in Formula One. Frentzen proved to be a disappointment though, and won only one race in two years with Williams, the 1997 San Marino Grand Prix. Jacques Villeneuve won seven races during 1997, compared to five wins by his main rival, Michael Schumacher of a resurgent Ferrari. Williams also achieved the 100-race-win milestone at the British Grand Prix. Coming to the final round of the season at Jerez, Schumacher led Villeneuve by 1 point; however, on lap 48, Schumacher and Villeneuve collided. Schumacher was disqualified from second place in the championship as the accident was deemed by the FIA as &quot;avoidable&quot;. Williams won the Constructors&#x27; title for the second time in a row, scoring 123 points. Jacques Villeneuve won the Drivers&#x27; Championship by three points to Michael Schumacher, who kept his points total despite being removed from second place; thus, runner-up went to Frentzen with 42 points.

===Mecachrome engines (1998)===
====1998 season====
After 1997, the team was unable to maintain their dominance in Formula 1 as Renault ended their full-time involvement in Formula 1, and Adrian Newey moved to the rival team, McLaren. Williams then had to pay for Mecachrome engines, which were old, rebadged Renault F1 engines. This meant that the FW20 not only featured a very similar aerodynamic package to their 1997 car but also virtually the same engine, leading some to comment that they ran what was virtually the same car, adjusted for the 1998 regulations. There were changes on the sponsorship front, as Rothmans opted to promote their Winfield brand, replacing the popular blue and white livery with a red one. For , Williams kept both drivers from the previous season, the first time since that a reigning world champion remained driving for the team. While Ferrari and McLaren battled for the Constructors&#x27; and Drivers&#x27; titles, Williams fell to the middle of the field. The team won no races and took only 3 podiums during the season, with Frentzen finishing in third at the first round in Australia and Villeneuve finishing third in Germany and Hungary. Williams finished third in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, scoring 38 points, while Villeneuve finished fifth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 21 points, and his German teammate, Frentzen, finished 4 points behind him in seventh.

===Supertec engines (1999)===
====1999 season====

In , Williams employed the Supertec engine, which was a rebadged Mecachrome-Renault unit, and a new driver line-up. Villeneuve moved to the new British American Racing (BAR) team, while Frentzen moved to Jordan trading places with fellow German Ralf Schumacher who joined Williams. To replace Villeneuve, Williams signed Italian Alex Zanardi, who after an unsuccessful F1 career in the early 1990s had been racing in the CART series for Chip Ganassi Racing, winning two series championships and a total of fifteen races in his three years. As with Schumacher, a driver trade was made with Ganassi, where Zanardi would join Williams and the team&#x27;s test driver at the time, Juan Pablo Montoya, would join CART in Zanardi&#x27;s car for 1999 and 2000.

The team managed three podiums, all scored by Ralf Schumacher, with third place in Australia and Britain and a second place in Italy. Zanardi, meanwhile, struggled through the entire season and failed to finish in the points at any race. Due in large part to this, the team finished fifth in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, the lowest finish for Williams in the 1990s; the team finished behind Stewart and Jordan, with Schumacher scoring all of the team&#x27;s 35 points.

After the season, deciding the relationship was not working, Zanardi&#x27;s contract with the team was terminated by mutual agreement. He would eventually return to CART in 2001.

===BMW engines (2000–2005)===
In 1998, the team signed a long-term agreement with German manufacturer BMW to supply engines and expertise for a period of 6 years. As part of the deal, BMW expected at least one driver to be German, which led to the team&#x27;s signing of Ralf Schumacher for the subsequent season. In 1999, the team had a Williams car with a BMW engine testing at circuits, in preparation for a debut in the season.

There were major sponsorship changes for 2000–2005, as Rothmans International had been purchased in 1999 by British American Tobacco (BAT), which owned British American Racing and chose not to renew Rothmans&#x27;s contract with Williams. BMW paid for Williams cars to be entirely in blue and white – unlike the standard motorsport livery scheme, dominated by the colours of the team or major sponsors with the logos of minor sponsors in their own colour schemes. Williams&#x27;s second major sponsor became Compaq, and following Compaq&#x27;s acquisition the team debuted Hewlett-Packard (HP) sponsorship at the 2002 British Grand Prix. In a cross-promotion of this technological partnership, a worldwide television commercial featured drivers Ralf Schumacher and Juan Pablo Montoya seemingly driving their BMW Williams cars around a track by radio control from a grandstand.

The new &quot;clean&quot; image allowed Williams to sign a cigarette anti-craving brand, Niquitin, and Anheuser-Busch, alternating with the Budweiser beer brand and SeaWorld Adventure Parks, in compliance with trademark disputes or alcohol bans.

====2000 season====
To replace Zanardi, Britain&#x27;s Jenson Button made his series debut. The first season of Williams&#x27;s partnership with BMW did not yield a single victory, but they managed to get on the podium three times, with Ralf Schumacher responsible for all three. Williams finished third in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, with 36 points, one more than the prior year. Ralf Schumacher finished fifth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, while Button, in his debut season, finished in eighth. Button made scrappy mistakes in early races (Monaco, Europe), but overall made an impressive debut in Melbourne, and continued to impress, notably at Silverstone, Spa, and Suzuka.

====2001 season====

In , the arrangement between Williams and Ganassi came to an end, and thus Williams was able to bring Juan Pablo Montoya back to drive full-time for the team. He was returning after two successful years in CART, where he succeeded Zanardi as champion for 1999 and won ten races total; he also had become the first CART driver since the infamous 1996 split of American open-wheel racing to win the Indianapolis 500, doing so in 2000.

Since Montoya was returning to Williams, this left Jenson Button as the odd man out. He would move over to Benetton, which was still running rebadged Renault engines, for what was the team&#x27;s final season under that name.

The FW23 won four races, three by Ralf Schumacher at Imola, Montreal, and his home Grand Prix in Germany. His teammate, Montoya, was victorious at Monza, and would have won a few more races if not for the FW23&#x27;s unreliability and pit crew blunders. The car proved to be quicker than the Ferrari and McLaren counterparts in several races, but Williams&#x27;s 2001 campaign only yielded third place in the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

====2002 season====
Williams maintained their driver line-up for the season. The team only won one race, which was at Malaysia, one of only 2 races not won by Ferrari in a year dominated by the Ferraris of Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello. Despite Montoya qualifying on pole for 7 races, he ended up having a winless season. Williams did improve on their Constructors&#x27; Championship position, finishing in second. Montoya finished third in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, eight points ahead of Ralf Schumacher, who finished fourth.

In qualifying for the at the Monza circuit, Montoya lapped his Williams FW24 in 1:20.264 for an average speed of , breaking the speed record of set by Keke Rosberg in a Honda turbo-powered Williams FW10 at Silverstone for the 1985 British Grand Prix.

====2003 season====

 would see Williams come closest to winning its first title since 1997. During pre-season, Frank Williams was very confident that the FW25 would challenge for the title. The team won four races, with Montoya winning at Monaco and Germany, while Ralf Schumacher won at the Nürburgring and the following race at Magny-Cours. Montoya stayed in contention for the Drivers&#x27; Championship during the season, and finished third, 11 points behind Michael Schumacher, while Ralf Schumacher finished fifth, 24 points behind Montoya. Williams finished second in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, two points ahead of McLaren.

====2004 season====

At the start of the season, it was announced that Montoya would be moving to McLaren in 2005. The team began the season with a radical nose-cone design, known as the &quot;Walrus-Nose&quot;, that proved uncompetitive and was replaced by a more conventional assembly in Hungary. Ferrari dominated for a third consecutive season, winning 15 of the 18 races. Williams picked up a win at the final race in Brazil, with Juan Pablo Montoya finishing one second ahead of Kimi Räikkönen&#x27;s McLaren; this remained Williams&#x27;s last F1 win until the 2012 Spanish Grand Prix. Another low part of the season was when both Williams and Toyota were disqualified from the Canadian Grand Prix after it was discovered that both cars had brake irregularities, the brake ducts seemingly not conforming to regulations. Williams finished the season in fourth, scoring 88 points and finishing on the podium six times, while Montoya was the highest-placed Williams driver that year, scoring 58 points to finish in fifth position.

====2005 season====

For the season, Schumacher moved to Toyota, while Montoya moved to McLaren. Taking their places were Australian Mark Webber and German Nick Heidfeld. Jenson Button was to have driven for Williams in 2005, but an FIA ruling forced Button to remain with his current team, BAR. Antônio Pizzonia served as the test driver for the team during the 2005 season. Meanwhile, Button signed a contract to drive for Williams in 2006.

Although there was some positive moments, such as a double podium finish in Monaco and Heidfeld qualifying on pole position at the Nürburgring, Williams slipped further back down the field in 2005, due in part to the return to form of rivals McLaren and the emergence of Toyota as a front-running team. Williams failed to win a race for the first time since 2000, and only registered four podium finishes over the course of the season, finishing fifth in the constructors&#x27; championship with 66 points. Heidfeld was replaced by Pizzonia for the last five races of the season after the former suffered firstly a testing accident, and then was hit by a motorbike when out cycling prior to the race in Brazil. Pizzonia could only contribute two points towards the team&#x27;s tally.

During the course of the 2004 and 2005 F1 seasons, BMW Motorsport and director Mario Theissen increasingly became publicly critical of the Williams F1 team&#x27;s inability to create a package capable of winning the Constructors&#x27; Championship, or even multiple victories within a single season. Williams, on the other hand, blamed BMW for not producing a good enough engine. Williams&#x27;s failed attempt to prise Jenson Button out of his BAR contract may also have been an issue with Theissen. Despite Frank Williams&#x27;s rare decision to capitulate to commercial demands by employing German driver Nick Heidfeld when he allegedly preferred Antônio Pizzonia, the fallout between Williams and BMW continued through the 2005 Formula One season. Despite BMW&#x27;s contract with Williams to supply engines until 2009, this public deterioration of the relationship between Williams and BMW was a factor in the decision by BMW Motorsport to buy Sauber and rebrand that team to feature the BMW name.

===Cosworth engines (2006)===
====2006 season====
Williams opted for Cosworth V8 engines for the which saw Nico Rosberg replace German Nick Heidfeld, who departed for BMW Sauber, while Mark Webber stayed on with the team. Despite having signed a contract to race for Williams, Jenson Button decided to stay with BAR for 2006 as it was to become a Honda works team. In September 2005 a deal was reached to allow Button to remain with BAR, with Williams receiving around £24m, some of it paid by Button himself, to cancel this contract.

Williams and Cosworth entered a partnership agreement where Cosworth would supply engines, transmissions and associated electronics and software for the team. Major sponsors Hewlett-Packard concluded sponsorship agreements one year before their official end of contract. The Williams team also switched to Bridgestone tyres.

The season started well, with both drivers scoring points in the opening race of the season, and Nico Rosberg setting the fastest lap at the Bahrain Grand Prix. The rest of the season was disappointing for Williams, with 20 retirements out of 36 starts for the two cars. The team failed to finish on the podium all season, the first time this had happened since Williams&#x27;s debut season in 1977. The team eventually finished eighth in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, with only 11 points.

===Customer Toyota engines (2007–2009)===
====2007–2009 seasons====


Following Williams&#x27;s worst points tally since , the team announced that Japanese manufacturer Toyota would be supplying the leased customer engines for the season. In addition, the Toyota engine customer deal also included Magneti Marelli Step 11 engine control unit (ECU) systems and Panasonic battery package as it was used by works Toyota team. A number of other changes were announced for 2007: Alexander Wurz, who had been a test driver at Williams since 2006, became the team&#x27;s second driver to replace the outgoing Mark Webber; Japanese driver Kazuki Nakajima, son of Satoru, replaced Wurz as a test driver alongside Karthikeyan. Sponsorship saw a change in 2007, as it was announced that AT&amp;T would become the title sponsors for the team from the upcoming season. AT&amp;T was previously involved as minor sponsors with the Jaguar and McLaren teams but moved to Williams following McLaren&#x27;s announcement of a title sponsorship deal with Vodafone, a competitor of AT&amp;T. On 2 February, the new FW29 was presented to the media in the UK. Soon afterwards, the team secured a sponsorship deal with Lenovo who built the team&#x27;s new supercomputer.

Rosberg and Wurz gave Williams a more productive season in terms of points and, in Montreal, Wurz scored the team&#x27;s first podium finish since Nick Heidfeld&#x27;s second-place at the 2005 European Grand Prix. Over the course of the year, Rosberg was consistently in the points, scoring 20 during the season; in comparison, teammate Wurz finished in the points three times. Following the announcement that Wurz would be retiring from the sport, Williams brought in their young test driver Nakajima to drive the second car for them in the final race in Brazil. The Japanese driver finished in tenth despite starting from near the back of the grid, while Rosberg enjoyed his best race of the season, finishing in fourth. Williams finished fourth in the Constructors&#x27; Championship that year.

For the season, Williams confirmed Nico Rosberg and Kazuki Nakajima as their race drivers. Rosberg was confirmed as staying with Williams until the end of on 9 December 2007, ending speculation that he could take Fernando Alonso&#x27;s vacated seat at McLaren. During the Winter testing sessions, the team ran six different liveries to celebrate their 30th year in the sport and their 500th Grand Prix.

The 2008 season was a mixture of success and disappointment for Williams. While Rosberg managed to obtain 2 podiums in Australia and Singapore, the team struggled at circuits with high-speed corners. The fact that the team was one of the first to switch development to their 2009 car (when new regulations came in) also hindered their season and Williams finished a disappointing 8th in the Constructors&#x27; Championship. Rosberg stated that unless the team was more competitive in the near future, he would look to drive elsewhere. Williams retained Rosberg and Nakajima for the 2009 season.

Frank Williams had admitted that he had regretted parting with BMW but stated that Toyota had a tremendous ability to become a top engine supplier. Speculation had been surrounding Toyota&#x27;s future on the Formula 1 grid. This was due to the fact that for a big-budget team, Toyota had only managed second place as their best result. In December 2008, Williams confirmed their commitment to F1 following the Honda withdrawal announcement.

Ahead of the 2009 Brazilian Grand Prix, Williams announced that it would be ending its three-year partnership with Toyota and finding a new engine supplier for 2010.

===Return to Cosworth engines (2010–2011)===
====2010–2011 seasons====

After the termination of their Toyota contract, Williams announced that from the season they were to enter into a &quot;long-term partnership&quot; with Cosworth, and would be using an updated version of the CA V8 engine which powered their cars in 2006. Williams also announced a complete driver change for the 2010 season. Rubens Barrichello joined from 2009 Constructors&#x27; Champion Brawn GP, whilst GP2 champion Nico Hülkenberg graduated from the test driver seat. Replacing Hülkenberg in the test seat was Finland&#x27;s Valtteri Bottas, who finished third in the 2009 Formula Three Euroseries as well as winning the non-championship Masters of Formula 3 event at Zandvoort.

Their new 2010 car, the Williams FW32, was unveiled for the first time at a shakedown test at Silverstone. Its first official test was on 1 February at Circuit Ricardo Tormo in Valencia. Hülkenberg took the team&#x27;s first pole position in over five years, in variable conditions at the . Hülkenberg was dropped from the team ahead of the season, and replaced by Venezuelan newcomer and reigning GP2 Series champion Pastor Maldonado. The combination of Barrichello and Maldonado meant that 2011 would be the first time since 1981 that Williams would start a season without a European driver in their line-up.

At the second pre-season test in Jerez, Barrichello posted the fastest time of the week on the last day. That was to no avail as Williams endured one of their worst seasons to date: two ninth places for Barrichello and one tenth place for Maldonado were their best results during the entire year. After Brazil, the team ended with a ninth place in the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

===Return to Renault engines (2012–2013)===
====2012–2013 seasons====

On 4 July 2011, Williams announced they would be reuniting with engine-supplier Renault who were to supply the team&#x27;s engines from 2012 onwards. On 1 December 2011, it was confirmed that Maldonado would be retained for the 2012 season, along with reserve driver Valtteri Bottas, who took part in 15 Friday practice sessions. In January 2012, it was confirmed that Bruno Senna would be the driver to partner Maldonado, effectively ending Rubens Barrichello&#x27;s F1 career.

Prior to the 2012 season, Patrick Head moved from the Williams F1 team to Williams Hybrid Power Limited, another subsidiary of Williams Grand Prix Holdings. The team also announced that its relationship with AT&amp;T ended by mutual agreement, and there were negotiations with another telecommunications company for team&#x27;s title sponsorship. At the 2012 Spanish Grand Prix, Pastor Maldonado took his only Grand Prix victory, which was also Williams&#x27;s first race victory since 2004 Brazilian Grand Prix. Around 90 minutes after celebrating this win, a fire broke out in the garage of the Williams team, damaging the FW34 of Bruno Senna and leaving several injured. The team eventually achieved eighth position in the Formula One World Constructors&#x27; Championship.

Claire Williams, the daughter of team principal Frank Williams, was appointed deputy principal in March 2013. Maldonado was retained by the team for and was joined by Bottas, promoted from his role as test driver. The team struggled throughout the season, despite a good qualifying session at the Canadian Grand Prix and a place in the top 10 at the United States Grand Prix, scoring only five points in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship.

While Williams enjoyed a victory in the 2012 season and occasional points finishes, they did not reach the same heights as was achieved during their domination of Formula One during the 1990s. This, combined with an absolutely dismal 2013 season, prompted Williams to look for a new engine supplier from the 2014 season onwards.

===Mercedes power units (2014–present)===

====2014–2017 seasons====
In May 2013, Williams signed a long-term contract with Mercedes to supply engines for the team, the German manufacturer providing 1.6-litre V6 turbo engines from the start of the 2014 season. Bottas was retained as driver for , and Felipe Massa was signed from Ferrari to replace Maldonado. The team also unveiled a new, multi-year title sponsorship deal with drinks brand Martini. As part of the deal, the team became Williams Martini Racing, except in Bahrain, Russia and Abu Dhabi, where the team is known as Williams Racing because of alcohol advertising restrictions.

The team won its first pole position since 2012, courtesy of Massa at the ; it was the only time that Mercedes would be beaten to pole position over the course of the 2014 season. With Bottas qualifying alongside Massa, it was also the first time the team had locked out the front row since the 2003 German Grand Prix. The team enjoyed an upturn in performance, including a double podium in Abu Dhabi, resulting in them taking third place in the Constructors&#x27; Championship. They repeated this feat in the season, despite a low-key season owing to the resurgence of Ferrari.
The team went into the season with Bottas and Massa retained. Former Ferrari Driver Academy member Lance Stroll joined the team as a development driver; Alex Lynn became a reserve driver with Paul di Resta who was announced on 13 March, following Susie Wolff&#x27;s retirement from motorsport.

In September 2016, Massa announced his intentions to retire from Formula One, with Stroll later announced as his replacement for . Following Nico Rosberg&#x27;s decision to retire, the team released Bottas from his contract to allow him to take his place at Mercedes, with Massa returning to the team on a one-year deal.

Massa was forced to withdraw from the 2017 Hungarian Grand Prix due to illness; the team then announced that Paul di Resta would be racing alongside Stroll instead.

====2018–2019: Continued decline====
On 4 November 2017, Felipe Massa announced his decision to retire from F1. Renault reserve driver and 2016 GP2 Series 3rd-place finisher Sergey Sirotkin was signed as his replacement for , with Robert Kubica joining the team as a reserve and development driver.
Williams struggled over the course of the 2018 season, scoring only 7 points and finishing last in the Constructors&#x27; Championship standings. Although the FW41 rarely suffered from reliability issues, it was significantly off the pace; the team&#x27;s highest finish was Stroll&#x27;s 8th-place finish in Azerbaijan. The team&#x27;s only other points finish was at the , with Stroll finishing 9th and Sirotkin scoring his first championship point in 10th. This was also the only Grand Prix of the season in which the team reached the third qualifying session, with Stroll starting 10th on the grid.

On 27 February 2018 Martini announced that they would leave Williams and Formula One at the end of the 2018 season.
On 12 October 2018, the team announced that reigning Formula 2 champion George Russell would be joining the team for the season. On 22 November 2018 it was announced that reserve driver Robert Kubica would be promoted to the other seat, marking his return to Formula One after eight years away from the sport due to injury. For the 2019 season, the team entered into a partnership with Polish petroleum company PKN Orlen and a multi-year title sponsorship arrangement with telecommunications company ROKiT.

Williams missed the first two-and-a-half days of pre-season testing in Barcelona due to the FW42 not yet being ready, the only team to suffer such a setback. Williams began the season out of reach from being competitive. During qualifying at the season-opener in Australia, their fastest time was almost 1.3 seconds slower than the nearest competitor. In the race, Russell and Kubica finished two and three laps behind the leader respectively. The team&#x27;s best result of the season came in Germany, where Kubica was classified 10th, the team&#x27;s only points finish that season. However, this result only came after post-race penalties for other drivers. Upgrades came during the season with which the FW42 began to catch up to its competitors; Russell came within 0.1 seconds of reaching Q2 in qualifying for the and finished close to the points with 12th in Brazil. However, both cars would be eliminated in Q1 at every race of the season. Despite the team&#x27;s lack of performance in comparison to 2014–2017, it was confirmed that Williams have extended their engine supplier partnership with Mercedes until 2025.

On 19 September 2019, Williams announced that Kubica had decided to leave the team at the end of the 2019 season; he would go on to join Alfa Romeo as a reserve driver. 2019 Formula 2 Championship runner-up Nicholas Latifi was promoted from his role of reserve driver to replace Kubica for the season. Jack Aitken replaced Latifi as reserve driver. In May 2020, following publication of significant losses in 2019, Williams announced the immediate termination of its title sponsorship deal with ROKiT.

====2020–present: Buyout and new management====
In the opening race of 2020, the 2020 Austrian Grand Prix, Latifi reached 11th place, just outside the points, whereas in qualifying Russell was only 0.15 seconds away from reaching Q2 (Russell retired in the race with a fuel pressure issue). In the wet qualifying for the next race, the Styrian Grand Prix, Russell succeeded in making it out of Q1, the first time a Williams driver had done so since the 2018 Brazilian Grand Prix, and, in the slippery conditions, qualified in 12th. Russell started the race in 11th, following the application of penalties for other drivers.

At the 2020 Hungarian Grand Prix, both drivers made it out of Q1 for the first time since the 2018 Italian Grand Prix. It was Russell&#x27;s second time getting out of Q1, and Latifi&#x27;s first time getting out of Q1.

On 21 August 2020, Williams was acquired by US investment group Dorilton Capital for €152 million. The amount includes settling the debt of the company and it will continue to run under the Williams name and keep its UK base.

Despite being offered the chance to stay on as Team Principal, Claire Williams announced her departure from the team effective after the weekend of the 2020 Italian Grand Prix. Following this announcement, it will be the first time Williams F1 Team has not been under the leadership of the Williams family since its inception 43 years prior. Simon Roberts, who joined Williams from McLaren in May 2020, became the acting team principal of the team. In December 2020, Williams announced Jost Capito will be joining Williams as the new CEO, with Roberts becoming team principal and reporting to Capito. Williams failed to score a point in the 2020 season that had been disrupted and shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic, making it their first pointless season in 44 years.

During the 2021 Monaco Grand Prix, Williams celebrated their 750th Grand Prix start. To celebrate the occasion, Williams launched a competition where the names of 100 Williams supporters were featured on their car, the Williams FW43B, together with the number of races since they started supporting Williams. In June 2021, Roberts left the team. Most of his responsibilities were taken over by Capito, with François-Xavier Demaison taking his trackside leadership duties. The 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix saw Williams score their first points since the 2019 German Grand Prix with Robert Kubica, and their first double points finish since the 2018 Italian Grand Prix. At the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix, Russell qualified in 2nd place and scored Williams&#x27;s first podium since the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, as the race was stopped after only two laps under safety car conditions were completed, allowing most drivers to retain their qualifying position. The team also achieved a second consecutive double points finish, as Latifi finished 9th.
Russell scored back-to-back points at the 2021 Italian Grand Prix and at the 2021 Russian Grand Prix (9th and 10th respectively; in the latter he qualified 3rd, behind Carlos Sainz Jr. and pole-sitter Lando Norris). Williams finished in 8th place in the Constructors&#x27; Championship with 23 points, 10 points ahead of Alfa Romeo, which finished in 9th place.

For the 2022 season, Russell left Williams to join the Mercedes works team, whose junior team he had been a part of. Ex-Red Bull driver, Alex Albon, was signed to replace Russell. Latifi retained his spot in the team. Prior to the season, Williams announced a partnership deal with the battery manufacturer Duracell. Albon scored the team&#x27;s first points of the season in the Australian Grand Prix, where he pitted only once on the last lap and finished tenth. Albon also finished ninth in the Miami Grand Prix. Latifi achieved his first ever Q3 appearance at the British Grand Prix, though he dropped out of the points and finished in twelfth. Following a number of penalties for other drivers at the Belgian Grand Prix, Albon qualified ninth and started sixth. Albon went on to score Williams&#x27;s third point position finish by ending the race in tenth. Prior to the third practice session at the Italian Grand Prix, Albon withdrew after feeling ill and suffering from appendicitis. Williams announced Nyck de Vries as the replacement. In his first ever qualifying session, de Vries qualified thirteenth, but started eighth after penalties. de Vries went on to finish ninth, scoring points on his debut.

Preceding the start of the 2023 race year, Mercedes ex-chief strategist James Vowles was announced to take over as the Team&#x27;s new Principal, following the resignation of former Team Principal Jost Capito in 2022.

For the season, Williams announced a long-term partnership with Gulf Oil. Albon&#x27;s contract had been extended, partnering rookie Logan Sargeant; Sargeant, who replaces the departing Nicholas Latifi, is the first American driver to race in Formula One since Alexander Rossi drove for the former Marussia F1 team for five races in .

The season-opener of the saw Albon score one point in tenth ahead of Sargeant, who finished twelfth. Albon retired at the following race at the due to a brake failure with Sargeant placing sixteenth after he failed to set a time within the 107% rule in qualification due to mechanical issues. In the , Albon retired again after losing control of his car and crashing heavily early into the race, causing a red flag. Sargeant, meanwhile, crashed with AlphaTauri driver Nyck de Vries during lap 56 of 58 after a restart. However, Sargeant was classified as having finished 16th, given that he had completed more than 90% of the race distance. Albon and Sargeant were retained for the season. The latter was due to be replaced by Carlos Sainz Jr. in the season. However, Sargeant was released after the 2024 Dutch Grand Prix due to his underperformances and his crash in the third practice section. His replacement, from the 2024 Italian Grand Prix to the end of the season, was current Formula 2 driver and Williams Driver Academy member Franco Colapinto, who would become the first Argentine driver to compete in F1 since Gastón Mazzacane in .

In February 2025, Williams announced a record multi-year title sponsorship with Atlassian and will enter the 2025 season as Atlassian Williams Racing.

==Williams Group==
Williams Grand Prix Holdings is the public company of Williams Group, which includes the Formula One Team and others like Williams Heritage, Williams Grand Prix Technologies (WGPT), and collaborations with other brands. It was also the former parent company of Williams Hybrid Power &amp; Williams Advanced Engineering. Both of these businesses took technology developed for F1 and adapted it for multiple commercial applications. Williams Hybrid Power was sold to GKN in March 2014 and Williams Advanced Engineering was sold to Fortescue in February 2022.

Williams Grand Prix Holdings is currently owned by Dorilton Capital who purchased the team on 21 August 2020. With the acquisition, Claire Williams was offered the chance to stay on as a team principal but that offer was declined. The 2020 Italian Grand Prix in Monza was the last race where the Williams family led the team.

The sale happened after years of financial difficulties. Reuters reported on 20 November 2009 that founders Sir Frank Williams and Patrick Head had sold a minority stake in the team to an investment company led by Toto Wolff. In February 2011, Williams F1 announced plans to raise capital through an initial public offering (IPO) on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FWB) in March 2011, with Sir Frank Williams remaining the majority shareholder and team principal after the IPO.

In December 2017 Sir Frank Williams owned 51.3% of the company, with 24.1% on the public marketplace, Brad Hollinger owning 11.7%, Patrick Head 9.3%, and 3.6% is held by an employee trust fund. However, in May 2020, Williams was put up for sale after posting a £13 million loss in the previous year.

===Williams Driver Academy===

Like most F1 teams, Williams operates its own driver academy. As of 2025, the Williams Driver Academy&#x27;s roster is Jamie Chadwick and Luke Browning.

Former drivers include Franco Colapinto, Logan Sargeant, Lance Stroll, Oliver Rowland, Nicholas Latifi, Dan Ticktum, Jack Aitken Both Colapinto and Stroll are driving in Formula One as of the 2024 season, while Sargeant, Latifi, and Aitken are the other four members to drive in the sport.

===Williams Experience Centre===
The Williams Experience Centre is located at the home of the Williams Formula 1 team in Grove, Oxfordshire.
Originally the base of BMW&#x27;s Le Mans project, the building was converted in 2002.

==Other motorsports activities==
===Formula Two===

Williams developed the car for the revived Formula Two championship, beginning in 2009. The design was originally created for a new, more-powerful offshoot of the Formula Palmer Audi series, however the car was re-purposed when Jonathan Palmer&#x27;s MotorSport Vision successfully bid for the rights to run the new Formula Two series.

===Group B rallying (1985–1986)===

The MG Metro 6R4 rally car was developed by Williams in 1984 on commission from Rover. The rally car was a MG Metro with a completely new V6 engine (mid-engined) and four-wheel drive, developed to the international Group B rallying regulations. Williams developed the car in just six months.

===British Touring Car Championship (1995–1999)===
Williams entered the British Touring Car Championship in 1995, taking over the works Renault programme. Alain Menu transferred from Renault Dealer Racing, with Will Hoy signed to partner him. Williams employed Ian Harrison, future director of Triple Eight Racing as team manager. While Menu was a championship contender, Hoy had constant failures and bad luck during the first half of the season. However, Hoy&#x27;s luck changed and he won three races and scored several podium finishes in the second half of the year, eventually taking fourth in the championship while Menu finished second in the championship with seven wins. Renault won the manufacturers championship. 1996 was a more difficult year with the front-wheel-drive cars outclassed by the 4WD Audi A4s of Frank Biela and John Bintcliffe. Menu was second in the championship again, while Hoy finished a lowly ninth. 1997 was a breakthrough year for Williams, winning the drivers&#x27; championship with Menu, the manufacturers&#x27; trophy and teams&#x27; award. Other changes for the team saw Jason Plato replacing Hoy, taking third in the championship. The team won 15 races out of 24 in 1997. It also competed in the 1997 Bathurst 1000 with Menu and Plato leading for much of the early part of the race. Alan Jones drove the second car, his first appearance for Williams since 1981.

1998 saw few changes to the Williams team: the driver line-up was unchanged with Menu to defend his title alongside Plato, but the main sponsor for 1998 was Nescafé, with Renault still putting sponsorship in for the team. While the Renaults had a new look for 1998, the opposition had caught up after 1997, and both Menu and Plato had a more difficult season, finishing fourth and fifth in the championship. In the final round of 1998 at Silverstone, a third car was entered for Independents Champion Tommy Rustad. Renault ultimately finished third in the manufacturers trophy and second in the teams championship. 1999 was the most difficult season for Williams, as Menu left Renault after racing with them since 1993. Plato was joined by Jean-Christophe Boullion. Nescafé were again the main sponsor for the Williams team in 1999. Renault did not have much luck in 1999 with engine failures haunting the team during the mid-part of the season. One win for Plato was the only success for the season, and Renault pulled out of the BTCC at the end of the season.

===Le Mans 24 Hours and Sportscars (1998–2000)===

Prior to their F1 partnership, Williams Motorsport built Le Mans Prototypes for BMW, known as the V12 LM and V12 LMR. The V12 LMR won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1999. The car was driven by Pierluigi Martini, Yannick Dalmas and Joachim Winkelhock, and operated by Schnitzer Motorsport under the name of BMW Motorsport.

===Formula E===

Williams&#x27;s Advanced Engineering division collaborated with Jaguar Racing in its debut season. Williams have a contract to supply the battery system for the Gen 3 Car from the 2021–22 Formula E World Championship.

==Automobile activities==
===Jaguar C-X75===

In May 2011 Jaguar announced a limited production of the C-X75 from 2013 to 2015, with a compact, forced induction petrol engine combined with electric motors instead of the micro gas turbines in the concept car. A maximum of 250 cars were planned to be built in partnership with Williams Advanced Engineering. The Jaguar C-X75 is a hybrid-electric, 2-seat, concept car produced by British automobile manufacturer Jaguar Cars in partnership with the derivative of the Formula One team, Williams Advanced Engineering which debuted at the 2010 Paris Motor Show.

===Renault Clio Williams===

The Williams name and logo were used on the Renault Clio Williams, a limited sports model of the production supermini, which was Formula One&#x27;s safety car at the 1996 Argentine Grand Prix.
However, no input was provided by Williams into the development of the car.

===Porsche 911 GT3R Hybrid===
Through subsidiary Williams Hybrid Power, the company developed and supplied a flywheel-based kinetic-energy storage system which was in use on a Porsche 911 GT3 R car in various GT racing series. The car achieved its first victory on 28 May 2011 at the 4th round of the VLN Endurance Racing Championship held at the Nürburgring.

==Former subsidiaries==

=== WAE Technologies===
WAE Technologies, formerly known as Williams Advanced Engineering (WAE), was the technology and engineering services business of the Williams Group. Based in the United Kingdom, it is located in a dedicated facility of , adjacent to Williams Formula One facilities.

The company provides the battery technology used in Formula E and Extreme E, and has assisted the development of the electric Vanda Electric Dendrobium car from Singapore. It has worked with Jaguar to create the C-X75 hybrid supercar. WAE partnered once again with Jaguar to build new stunt C-X75s for the 24th James Bond film, &quot;Spectre&quot;.

WAE announced in June 2013 a new collaboration with Nismo, the performance-orientated brand of Nissan, to partner in the development of high-performance road cars.

WAE generated revenues of £10.9m in fiscal year 2014–15, with profits of £1m.

The company announced in August 2017 a collaboration with Singer Vehicle Design. The initial work is a modified, naturally aspirated, air-cooled, flat-six Porsche 911 engine with a 4.0L capacity, four valves per cylinder and four camshafts, rated at 500HP.

On 1 May 2019, Williams Advanced Engineering announced their partnership with the FIA sanctioned electric off-road racing series, Extreme E. Williams Advanced Engineering will supply the batteries for the first two seasons of Extreme E, which began in 2021.

On 2 May 2019, it was announced that Williams Advanced Engineering will supply the batteries for the multi-make ETCR series that is due to launch in 2020.

On 24 January 2022, the Australian mining firm Fortescue announced it had purchased Williams Advanced Engineering for £164m in an effort to meet its carbon neutral targets for 2030. In January 2023, the company was renamed WAE Technologies. In June 2024, the company was renamed again as Fortescue Zero.

===Williams Hybrid Power===
Williams Hybrid Power (WHP) was the division of Williams F1 that developed electromechanical flywheels for mobile applications such as buses, trams and high-performance endurance-racing cars. A hybrid system that uses a spinning composite rotor to store energy, these flywheels help a vehicle save fuel and ultimately reduce its CO2 emissions.

WHP was first established in 2008 and immediately set about developing a new flywheel energy-recovery system for the Williams F1 Team after the introduction of Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems (KERS) into Formula One for the 2009 season. While other teams were pouring their efforts into electric battery systems, Williams F1 opted to go down the flywheel route because of a strong belief in the technology&#x27;s wider applications. While it was never raced in Formula One due to technical changes, WHP has since seen its technology adapted for a range of applications. For example, the Audi R18 hybrid car that won the 2012 Le Mans 24 Hours used a WHP flywheel. WHP has also seen its flywheel technology introduced into a series of buses as part of a deal with the Go-Ahead Group, one of the UK&#x27;s biggest transport operators. In April 2014, Williams Hybrid Power was sold to GKN.

== Race cars ==
While the team has entered customer cars into Formula One races since 1974 (running as the predecessor Frank Williams Racing Cars before 1978), the first being the Williams FW (the FW standing for team founder Frank Williams), Williams has built and entered their own cars since their first season as a constructor in 1978. All of their cars are named after founder Frank Williams.

<text>Williams College is a private liberal arts college in Williamstown, Massachusetts, United States. It was established as a men&#x27;s college in 1793 with funds from the estate of Ephraim Williams, a colonist from the Province of Massachusetts Bay who was killed in the French and Indian War in 1755. 

Williams&#x27;s main campus is located in Williamstown, in the Berkshires in rural northwestern Massachusetts, and contains more than 100 academic, athletic, and residential buildings. There are 360 voting faculty members, with a student-to-faculty ratio of 6:1. , the school has an enrollment of 2,021 undergraduate students and 50 graduate students.

Following a liberal arts curriculum, Williams College provides undergraduate instruction in 25 academic departments and interdisciplinary programs including 36 majors in the humanities, arts, social sciences, and natural sciences. Williams offers an almost entirely undergraduate instruction, though there are two graduate programs in development economics and art history. The college maintains affiliations with the nearby Clark Art Institute and the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (MASS MoCA) along with a close relationship with Exeter College, Oxford. The college competes in the NCAA Division III New England Small College Athletic Conference as the Ephs.

==History==
Colonel Ephraim Williams was an officer in the Massachusetts militia and a member of a prominent landowning family. Williams was killed at the Battle of Lake George on September 8, 1755. His will included a bequest to support and maintain a free school to be established in the town of West Hoosac, Massachusetts, provided the town change its name to Williamstown.

Members of the Williams family first attempted to found Queens College in Hatfield, Massachusetts, in 1762, but the charter was revoked within a year when Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard succumbed to pressure from Harvard College, which opposed the creation of a second institution of higher learning in the colonial-era Province of Massachusetts Bay. 

In 1765, the west township was incorporated as Williamstown. Five years later, the town&#x27;s proprietors brought the executors of Williams&#x27; estate before the General Court to dispute the delay in establishment of the free school, and in 1795, the Massachusetts legislature finally granted the school its charter.

The Williamstown Free School opened with 15 students on October 26, 1791. The first president was Ebenezer Fitch. Not long after its founding, the school&#x27;s trustees petitioned the Massachusetts legislature to convert the free school to a tuition-based college. The legislature agreed and on June 22, 1793, Williams College was chartered. It was the second college to be founded in Massachusetts.At its founding, the college maintained a policy of racial segregation, refusing admission to black applicants. This policy was challenged by Lucy Terry Prince, who is credited as the first black American poet, when her son Festus was refused admission on account of his race. Prince, who had established a reputation as a raconteur and rhetorician, delivered a three-hour speech before the college&#x27;s board of trustees, quoting abundantly from scripture, but was unable to secure her son&#x27;s admission. Later scholarship questions whether these events occurred as Festus Prince may have been refused entry for an insufficient mastery of Latin, Greek, and French, all of which were necessary for successful completion of the entrance exam at the time, and which would most likely not have been available in the local schools of Guilford, Vermont, where Festus was raised.

In 1806, a student prayer meeting gave rise to the American Foreign Mission Movement. In August of that year, five students met in the maple grove of Sloan&#x27;s Meadow to pray. A thunderstorm drove them to the shelter of a haystack, and the fervor of the ensuing meeting inspired them to take the Gospel abroad. The students went on to build the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, the first American organization to send missionaries overseas. The Haystack Monument near Mission Park on the Williams Campus commemorates the historic &quot;Haystack Prayer Meeting&quot;.

By 1815, Williams had only two buildings and 58 students and was in financial trouble, so the board voted to move the college to Amherst, Massachusetts. In 1821, the president of the college, Zephaniah Swift Moore, who had accepted his position believing the college would move east, decided to proceed with the move. He took 15 students with him, and re-founded the college under the name of Amherst College. Some students and professors decided to stay at Williams and were allowed to keep the land, which was at the time relatively worthless. Moore died just two years later after founding Amherst, and was succeeded by Heman Humphrey, a trustee of Williams College.
Edward Dorr Griffin was appointed President of Williams and is widely credited with saving Williams during his 15-year tenure. A Williams student, Gardner Cotrell Leonard, of Albany, New York, whose family owned the city&#x27;s Cotrell &amp; Leonard department store, designed the gowns he and his classmates wore to graduation in 1887. Seven years later he advised the Inter-Collegiate Commission on Academic Costume, which met at Columbia University, and established the current system of U.S. academic dress. One reason gowns were adopted in the late 19th century was to eliminate the differences in apparel between rich and poor students. Gardner Cotrell Leonard went on to edit the book &quot;The Songs of Williams&quot;, a collection of songs sung at the college. During World War II, Williams College was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

Originally a men&#x27;s college, Williams became co-educational in 1970. Fraternities were also phased out during this period, beginning in 1962.

Following a liberal arts curriculum, Williams College provides undergraduate instruction in 25 academic departments and interdisciplinary programs including 36 majors in the humanities, arts, social sciences, and natural sciences. Williams offers an almost entirely undergraduate instruction, though there are two graduate programs in development economics and art history. The college maintains affiliations with the nearby Clark Art Institute and Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (MASS MoCA), and has a close relationship with Exeter College, Oxford University, where the school runs a year-long study abroad program for juniors. The college competes in the NCAA Division III New England Small College Athletic Conference as the Ephs. Their athletic program has been highly successful, winning 22 of 29 College Directors&#x27; Cups for NCAA Division III.

Williams is a highly selective school with an acceptance rate of 8% for the Class of 2025. It has ranked first in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;&#x27;s rankings of National Liberal Arts Colleges every year since 2004. In April 2022, Williams transitioned to an all grants system for financial aid, one of the few institutions of higher learning in the United States to do so.

=== Coeducation ===

Though Williams College officially began the process of coeducation in the late 1960s, women integrated the college as early as the 1930s. Beatrice Irene Wasserscheid (née Acly) was the first woman to be awarded a Williams degree after successfully petitioning the trustees to pursue a master of arts degree in American literature. She received her master&#x27;s degree in June 1931. That same decade, in 1935, Emily Cleland became the first woman to teach at Williams when she finished teaching her late husband&#x27;s geology course after he died in an accident. The first tenured woman faculty member at the college, Doris DeKeyselingk, oversaw the Russian department beginning in 1958.

During his time as president of Williams College, John E. Sawyer officially initiated the process of coeducation. After overseeing the abolition of fraternities, Sawyer created a faculty-trustee committee, the Committee on Coordinate Education and Related Questions, in 1967 to explore options for coeducation and co-ordinate education. In response to the Committee on Coordinate Education&#x27;s final report, the trustees voted in June 1969 to regularly admit women undergraduate students in fall 1971. The college welcomed 137 women as first-year students in fall 1971. They were joined by 90 transfer and exchange students from women&#x27;s colleges who, during their junior and senior year, participated in the Ten College Exchange Program which Sawyer helped to establish in the mid-to-late 1960s. The graduating class of 1975 was the first fully co-educational class to graduate from Williams.

The college&#x27;s admission of women undergraduate students coincided with the diversification of faculty and staff. An affirmative action program, launched in 1972 by President John Chandler, reinforced equal opportunity employment. In addition to facilitating the hiring and retention of African-American staff and faculty, the program prioritized hiring women. As a result of the efforts of the dean of faculty and the provost in collaboration with &quot;Committee W&quot;, a women-led group dedicated to fulfilling the program&#x27;s mission, the number of women faculty steadily rose. From the inception of Williams&#x27;s affirmative action program in 1972 to its revision in 1975, the proportion of women full-time faculty increased from 4.5% to 11.7%. By 1975, 34% of the first-term assistant professors were women.

Throughout the 1970s, Williams College experienced an increase of women in high administrative and advisory positions as well. In February 1970, the college hired its first female dean, Nancy McIntire. In October 1971, at age 29, Gail Walker Haslett was elected as a three-year term trustee on the Williams College Board of Trustees. She was the first woman to ever serve on the board. In 1976, Pamela G. Carlton &#x27;76 became the first woman alumni trustee and Janet Brown &#x27;73, the first woman graduate of Williams to serve on the executive committee of the Society of Alumni.

, 45.6% of full-time faculty and 51.6% of the undergraduate class are women-identifying at Williams. In July 2018, Maud Mandel began her tenure as the 18th and current president of Williams College. She is the first woman to assume this role.

===Construction and expansion===

In the last decade, construction has changed the look of the college. The addition of the $38 million Unified Science Center to the campus in 2001 set a tone of style and comprehensiveness for renovations and additions to campus buildings in the 21st century. This building unifies the formerly separate lab spaces of the physics, chemistry, and biology departments. In addition, it houses Schow Science Library, notable for its unified science materials holdings and architecture. It features vaulted ceilings and an atrium with windows into laboratories on the second through fourth floors of the science center.

In 2003, Williams began the first of three massive construction projects. The $60 million &#x27;62 Center for Theatre and Dance was the first project to be successfully completed in the spring of 2005. The $44 million student center, called Paresky Center, opened in February 2007.

Construction had already begun on the third project, called the Stetson-Sawyer project, when economic uncertainty stemming from the 2007 financial crisis led to its delay. College trustees initially balked at the Stetson-Sawyer project&#x27;s cost, and revisited the idea of renovating Sawyer in its current location, an idea which proved not to be cost effective. The entire project includes construction of two new academic buildings, the removal of Sawyer Library from its current location, and the construction of a new library at the rear of a renovated Stetson Hall (which served as the college library prior to Sawyer&#x27;s construction). The academic buildings, temporarily named North Academic Building and South Academic Building, were completed in fall 2008. In the spring of 2009, South Academic Building was renamed Schapiro Hall in honor of former president Morton O. Schapiro. In spring 2010 the North Academic Building was renamed Hollander Hall. Construction of the new Sawyer Library was completed in 2014, after which the old Sawyer Library was razed.

After several years of planning, the college decided to group undergraduates starting with the Class of 2010 into four geographically coherent clusters, or &quot;Neighborhoods&quot;. Since the fall of 2006, first-years have been housed in Sage Hall, Williams Hall and Mission Park, while the former first-year dormitories East College, Lehman Hall, Fayerweather, and Morgan, joined the remaining residential buildings as upperclass housing. During the spring 2009 semester, a committee formed to evaluate the neighborhood system, and released a report the following fall. From 2003 through 2008, Williams conducted a capital campaign with the goal of raising $400 million by September 2008. The college reached $400 million at the end of June 2007. By the close of the campaign, Williams had raised $500.2 million.

As of the 2008-09 school year, the college eliminated student loans from all financial aid packages in favor of grants. The college was the fourth institution in the United States to do so, following Princeton University, Amherst College, and Davidson College. However, in February 2010, the college announced it would re-introduce loans to its financial aid packages beginning with the Class of 2015 due to the college&#x27;s changed financial situation. In January 2007 the board voted unanimously to reduce college CO2 emissions 10% below 1990 levels by 2020, or roughly 50% below 2006 levels. To meet those goals, the college set up the Zilkha Center for Environmental Initiatives and has undertaken an energy audit and efficiency timeline. Williams received an &#x27;A−&#x27; on the 2010 College Sustainability Report Card, following &#x27;B+&#x27; grades on both the 2008 and 2009 report cards. In December 2008, President Morton O. Schapiro announced his departure from the college to become president of Northwestern University.

On September 28, 2009, the presidential search committee announced the appointment of Adam Falk as the 17th president of Williams College. Falk, dean of the Zanvyl Krieger School of Arts and Sciences at Johns Hopkins University, began his term on April 1, 2010. Dean of the Faculty William G. Wagner took the position of interim president beginning in June 2009, and continued in that capacity until President-elect Falk took office. In 2014, Williams College brought their endowment above the 2 billion dollar mark. On March 11, 2018, former dean of the college at Brown University Maud Mandel was selected to be the 18th president of Williams College. Mandel assumed the role on July 1, 2018.

==Campus==

Williams is located on a campus in Williamstown, Massachusetts, in the Berkshires in rural northwestern Massachusetts. The campus contains more than 100 academic, athletic, and residential buildings.

The early planners of Williams College eschewed the traditional collegiate quadrangle organization, choosing to freely site buildings among the hills. Later construction, including East and West Colleges and Griffin Hall, tended to cluster around Main Street in Williamstown. The first campus quadrangle was formed with East College, South College, and the Hopkins Observatory.

The Olmsted Brothers design firm played a large part in shaping the campus design and architecture. In 1902, the firm was commissioned to renovate a large part of campus, including the President&#x27;s House, the cemetery, and South College; as well as incorporating the George A. Cluett estate into the campus acreage. Although these campus renovations were completed in 1912, the Olmsted Brothers would advise the gradual transformation of campus design for six decades. The present-day grounds layout reflects much of the design intent of the Olmsted Brothers.

Williams College is the site of the Hopkins Observatory, the oldest extant astronomical observatory in the United States. Erected in 1836–1838, it now contains the Mehlin Museum of Astronomy, including Alvan Clark&#x27;s first telescope (from 1852), as well as the Milham Planetarium, which uses a Zeiss Skymaster ZKP3/B optomechanical projector and an Ansible digital projector, both installed in 2005. The Hopkins Observatory&#x27;s 0.6-m DFM reflecting telescope (1991) is installed elsewhere on the campus. Williams joins with Wellesley, Wesleyan, Middlebury, Colgate, Vassar, Swarthmore, and Haverford/Bryn Mawr to form the Keck Northeast Astronomy Consortium, sponsored for over a decade by the Keck Foundation and now with its student research programs sponsored by the National Science Foundation. Hopkins Hall serves as the administration building on campus, housing the offices of the president, Dean of the Faculty, registrar, and provost, among others. There is a Newman Center on campus.
The Chapin Library supports the liberal arts curriculum of the college by allowing students close access to a number of rare books and documents of interest. The library opened on June 18, 1923, with an initial collection of 9,000 volumes contributed by alumnus Alfred Clark Chapin, Class of 1869. Over the years, Chapin Library has grown to include over 50,000 volumes (including 3,000 more given by Chapin) as well as 100,000 other artifacts such as prints, photographs, maps, and bookplates. The library is currently located on the fourth floor of the recently reopened Sawyer Library.

The Chapin Library&#x27;s Americana collection includes original printings of all four founding documents of the United States: the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. Additionally it houses George Washington&#x27;s copy of &quot;The Federalist&quot; and the British reply to the Declaration of Independence.

The Chapin Library&#x27;s science collection includes a first edition of Nicolaus Copernicus&#x27;s &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot;, as well as first editions of books by Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler, Galileo, Isaac Newton, and other major figures.

The Williams College Museum of Art (WCMA), with over 12,000 works (only a fraction of which are displayed at any one time) in its permanent collection, serves as an educational resource for both undergraduates and students in the graduate art history program.

Notable works include &quot;Morning in a City&quot; by Edward Hopper, a commissioned wall painting by Sol LeWitt, and a commissioned outdoor sculpture and landscape work by Louise Bourgeois entitled &quot;Eyes&quot;.

Although often overshadowed by the neighboring and much larger Clark Art Institute and Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (MASS MoCA), WCMA remains one of the premier attractions of the Berkshires. Because the museum is intended primarily for educational purposes, admission is free for all students.

Located in front of the West College dormitory, the Hopkins gate serves as a memorial to brothers Mark and Albert Hopkins. Both made lasting contributions to the Williams College community. Mark was appointed as president of the college in 1836, while Albert was elected a professor in 1829.

==Organization and administration==
The board of trustees of Williams College has 25 members and is the governing authority of the college. The president of the college serves on the board &quot;ex officio.&quot; There are five alumni trustees, each of whom serves for a five-year term. There are five term trustees, each elected by the board for five-year terms. The remaining 14 members are regular trustees, also elected by the board but serving up to 15 years, although not beyond their seventieth birthday. The current chair of the board of trustees is Liz Robinson.

The board appoints as senior executive officer of the college a president who is also a member of and the presiding officer of the faculty. Nine senior administrators report to the president, including the dean of the faculty, provost, and dean of the college. Adam F. Falk is the 17th president of Williams, and took office on April 1, 2010.

College Council (CC) was the student government of Williams College until 2020, when the student body voted to replace it with the Three Pillars plan: student-faculty committees, Williams Student Union (WSU), and Facilitators for Allocating Student Taxes (FAST). The WSU consists of 12 members (three representatives per class year) who are elected by their classes and serve semester terms. FAST members are responsible for managing the student activity tax and are in charge of distributing funds to registered student organizations (RSOs). 

To manage its endowment, the college started the Williams College Investment Office in 2006. In 2020, the endowment-per-student ratio reached $1.40 million unadjusted for inflation, while in 1990, it was $151,000. Adjusting for inflation, the endowment-per-student ratio had still increased to almost $600,000. In 2021, Williams&#x27; endowment-per-student ratio was one of nine colleges or universities to exceed $2 million along with Princeton, Yale, MIT, Stanford, Harvard,
Amherst, Pomona, and Swarthmore.

===Presidents===

The Office of the President is located in Hopkins Hall, named after Mark Hopkins, Williams&#x27;s fourth president, and the president of the college lives in the Samuel Sloan House, erected in 1801. Before moving into the Samuel Sloan House, the president originally lived in a nearby house where Hopkins Hall now stands. The house has been renovated multiple times since originally being built, including over $500,000 in renovations in 2000 and 2001.

Since its creation in 1793, Williams College has had 17 full-time presidents and two interim presidents. The 18th president and current president is Maud Mandel, who began her tenure on July 1, 2018.


==Academics==

Williams is a small, four-year liberal arts college accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education. There are three academic curricular divisions (humanities, sciences, and social sciences), 25 departments, 36 majors, and two small master&#x27;s degree programs in art history and development economics. Students may also concentrate in 12 additional academic areas that are not offered as majors (e.g., cognitive science). The academic year follows a 4–1–4 schedule of two four-course semesters plus a one-course &quot;winter study&quot; term in January. During the winter study term, students study one of various courses outside of typical curriculum for 3 weeks. Students typically take this course on a pass/fail basis. Past course offerings have included: Ski Patrol, Learn to Play Chess, Accounting, Inside Jury Deliberations, and Creating a Life: Shaping Your Life After Williams, among many others. Williams students often take the winter study term to study abroad or work on intensive research projects.

Williams&#x27; most popular undergraduate majors, based on 2021 graduates, were:
*Econometrics and Quantitative Economics (82)
*Biology/Biological Sciences (54)
*Computer Science (41)
*Art/Art Studies (35)
*English Language and Literature (32)
*Chemistry (25)
*Mathematics (23)

The college&#x27;s 2021-22 Comprehensive Fee was $76,980, including tuition ($61,450) and board, room, and fees ($15,530). 48% of students were given need-based financial aid, which averaged $63,516.

Williams sponsors the Williams–Mystic program at Mystic Seaport; the Williams–Exeter Programme at Exeter College of Oxford University; and Williams in Africa. Williams has a close relationship with Exeter College, one of the oldest constituent colleges of Oxford University. In the early 1980s, Williams purchased a group of houses, today known as the Ephraim Williams House, on Banbury Road and Lathbury Road, in North Oxford.

The Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford (WEPO) was founded in 1985. Every year (except 2010–2011 and 2022–2023), 26 undergraduate students from Williams spend their junior year at Exeter as full members of the college.

===Admissions===
Williams is classified as &quot;most selective&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; and &quot;more selective&quot; by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.

For freshmen students admitted in fall 2021 (Class of 2025), the average redesigned SAT was 1470-1550. The average super-scored ACT Composite score was 33-35.

The college is need-blind for domestic applicants.

===Reputation and rankings===
In the 2010, 2011, and 2014 &quot;Forbes&quot; college rankings, Williams was ranked the No. 1 undergraduate institution in the United States. Williams was the first school to achieve three first place &quot;Forbes&quot; rankings, while placing second in 2012, 2015, and 2016. Annual rankings following 2017 would see Williams fall out of the top ten to as low as 19th in 2019. Williams ranked 18th after &quot;Forbes&quot; changed their ranking methodology to emphasize alumni salaries and graduation debt in 2021. In the Forbes 2022 College Rankings, Williams College rose to 7th. In their 2024 ranking, the college fell again, to 17th.

Williams has been ranked first in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;&#x27;s rankings of Best National Liberal Arts Colleges every year since 2004, and has been in the top three every year since the rankings were created in 1984. (This list does not include research universities: unlike &quot;Forbes&quot;, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranks universities and liberal arts colleges on separate lists.)
===Winter study===
Williams follows a 4-1-4 schedule, with the month of January dedicated to &quot;Winter Study&quot;, a time when students take one course (or more) on campus or engage in an international program, an internship, or independent research project. A significant number of Winter Study courses are taught by Williams College alumni, and feature topics otherwise not covered in a traditional liberal arts curriculum—such as financial accounting, entrepreneurship, journalism, and yoga. Winter Study courses change yearly—the catalog features international programs in public health (where students travel to Nicaragua or Liberia), cultural immersion (for example, programs in Morocco and France), and political work (for example, a three-week internship program in the government of the Republic of Georgia).

===Oxbridge tutorials===
Certain portions of the Williams education are modeled after the tutorial systems at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. Although tutorials at Williams were originally aimed at upperclassmen, the faculty voted in 2001 to expand the tutorial program. There is now a diverse offering of tutorial courses that span many disciplines, including math and sciences, and cater to students of all class years. In 2009–2010 alone, 62 tutorials were offered in 21 departments. Enrollment for tutorials is capped at 10 students, who are then divided into five pairs that each meet separately with the professor once a week. Each week, one student in each tutorial pair writes and presents a 5–7-page paper while the other student writes a critique response. The same pair reverses roles for the next week. The professor takes a more limited role than in a traditional lecture class and usually allows the students to steer and guide the direction of the conversation. Professor (and former Dean and English Department Chair) Stephen E. Fix was one of the early advocates for expanding the tutorial system at Williams and worked to increase support for the concept and the number of tutorial classes offered to students.

Student course evaluations for tutorials are typically very high. In a survey of alumni who had taken tutorials, more than 80% rated their tutorials as &quot;the most valuable of my courses&quot; at Williams.

==Student activities and traditions==

===Student media===
The longest-running student newspaper at Williams is the &quot;Williams Record&quot;, a weekly broadsheet paper published on Wednesdays. The newspaper was founded in 1887, and now has a weekly circulation of 3,000 copies distributed in Williamstown, in addition to more than 600 subscribers across the country. The newspaper formerly received no financial support from the college or from the student government and relied on revenue generated by local and national ad sales, subscriptions, and voluntary contributions for use of its website, but the paper went into debt in 2004 and is now subsidized by the Student Activities Tax. Both Sawyer Library and the College Archives maintain more than a century&#x27;s worth of publicly accessible, bound volumes of the &quot;Record&quot;. The newspaper provides access free of charge to a searchable database of articles stretching back to 1998 on its website.

The student yearbook is called &quot;The Gulielmensian&quot;, which means &quot;Williamsian&quot; in Latin. It was published irregularly in the 1990s, but has been annual for the past several years and dates back to the mid-19th century.

Numerous smaller campus publications are also produced each year, including &quot;The Telos&quot;, a journal of Christian thought; &quot;The Haystack&quot;, a humor magazine; the &quot;Williams College Law Journal&quot;, a collection of undergraduate articles; the &quot;Literary Review&quot;, a literary magazine; and &quot;Monkeys With Typewriters&quot;, a magazine of non-fiction essays.

====91.9 WCFM====
WCFM is a college-owned, student-run, non-commercial radio station broadcasting from the basement of Prospect House at 91.9 MHz. Featuring 85 hours per week of original programming, the station features a wide variety of musical genres, in addition to sports and talk radio. The station may also be heard on the Internet via SHOUTcast.com. Members of the surrounding communities above the age of 18 are allowed to DJ on the station, which, as part of its mission, seeks to serve the surrounding community with news and announcements of public interest. The board of the radio station has held a handful of concerts.

===Trivia contest===
At the end of every semester but one since 1966, WCFM has hosted an all-night, eight-hour trivia contest. Teams of students, alumni, professors, friends, and others compete to answer questions on a variety of subjects, while simultaneously identifying songs and performing designated tasks. The winning team&#x27;s only prize is the obligation to create and host the following semester&#x27;s contest.

The precise date of the debut contest is uncertain. Most spring contests occur in early May, but during its first decade, Williams Trivia was sometimes held in March or February. Assuming a May date, Lawrence University&#x27;s 50-hour-long Great Midwest Trivia Contest, first held on April 29, 1966, would be the oldest continuous competition of its sort in the United States, but if the first Williams contest was held earlier, it would be the oldest. The distinction is, appropriately, trivial.

While other college-based trivia contests in the United States emphasize marathon endurance and revel in the obscurity of their arcana, the aim of the Williams contest is to cram as much evocative and entertaining material into as concentrated a space as possible. Lasting just eight hours, a typical Williams Trivia contest will demand between 900 and 1,200 separate &quot;bits&quot; of trivial information, delivering twice as much content as its &quot;competitors&quot; in a fraction of the time. No discernible rivalry exists between any of the various contests. The contest has occasionally received outside media coverage, including in the New York Times.

===School colors and mascot===
Williams&#x27;s school colors are purple and gold, with purple as the primary school color. A story explaining the origin of purple as a school color says that at the Williams-Harvard baseball game in 1869, spectators watching from carriages had trouble telling the teams apart because there were no uniforms. One of the onlookers bought ribbons from a nearby millinery store to pin on Williams&#x27;s players, and the only color available was purple. The buyer was Jennie Jerome (later Winston Churchill&#x27;s mother) whose family summered in Williamstown.

The Williams college mascot is a purple cow. The mascot&#x27;s name, Ephelia, was submitted in a radio contest in October 1952 by Theodore W. Friend, a senior at Williams. The origins of the cow mascot are unknown, but one possibility is that it was inspired by the &quot;Purple Cow&quot; humor magazine, a student publication begun in 1907, which used the college color along with a cow.

===Alma mater===
Williams claims the first &quot;alma mater&quot; song written by an undergraduate, &quot;The Mountains&quot;, was by Washington Gladden of the class of 1859.

In 2016, a college-wide contest was held for a new official Williams song. The winner was &quot;Echo of Williams&quot;, music by Kevin Weist, class of 1981, and lyrics by Bruce Leddy, class of 1983.

===Mountain Day===
On one of the first three Fridays in October, the president of the college cancels classes and declares it Mountain Day. The bells ring, announcing the event, members of the Outing Club unfurl a banner from the roof of Chapin Hall and students hike up Stony Ledge. At Stony Ledge, they celebrate with donuts, cider and &quot;a cappella&quot; performances.

The first known mention of Mountain Day was made in 1827 by Williams president Edward Dorr Griffin in his notebook on college business. He wrote, under &#x27;Holidays&#x27;: &quot;About the 24th of June a day to go to the mountain. If not then about the 14th of July. Prayers at night.&quot;

In 2009, with the threat of bad weather for each of the first three Fridays of the month, Interim-president Wagner declared &quot;Siberian Mountain Day&quot;. Festivities were relocated from Stony Ledge to the much more accessible Stone Hill.

===Alpine Club of Williamstown===
In 1863 Professor Albert Hopkins founded the Alpine Club of Williamstown, one of the first mountain clubs in America. Most significantly, it was likely the first hiking club of any type in the world to include women. In addition to Professor Albert Hopkins, Professor Paul Chadbourne and Reverend Harry Hopkins, there were nine unmarried ladies from Williamstown who formed the nucleus of the original club. Over the course of its first year four more women and nine men were added to the membership rolls. Most of the new male members were students from Williams College, among them Samuel H. Scudder, who would become one of the co-founders of the Appalachian Mountain Club in 1876.

==Athletics==

The school&#x27;s athletic teams (except for the men&#x27;s rugby team, the White Dawgs) are called the Ephs (rhymes with &quot;chiefs&quot;), a shortening of the first name of founder Ephraim Williams. The mascot is a Purple Cow. They participate in the NCAA&#x27;s Division III and the New England Small College Athletic Conference. Williams also competes in skiing and squash at the Division I level. Williams is ranked first among Division III schools for athletic spending per student.

Williams has a traditional rivalry with Amherst College and Wesleyan University. The &quot;Little Three&quot;, a subset of NESCAC, comprises the three schools Although Williams College typically sports purple and gold as their school colors, purple is in fact the only school color. The gold was added in order to differentiate its colors from that of rival school Amherst&#x27;s purple and white uniforms. On May 3, 2009, Williams and Amherst alumni played a game of vintage baseball at Wahconah Park according to 1859-rules to commemorate the 150th-anniversary of the first college baseball game, which was played on July 2, 1859, between the two schools.

Until 1994, Williams was not permitted, by NESCAC rules, to compete in team NCAA competition. The Williams women&#x27;s swimming and diving team won the school&#x27;s first national title in 1981, and claimed the title in 1982 as well. Williams played in the 2003, 2004, 2010, and 2014 men&#x27;s basketball Division III national championship games, winning the title in March 2003. Men&#x27;s basketball also played in the 1997, 1998, 2011, and 2017 Final Fours. Williams was the first New England basketball team to win a Division III championship, and since they have been eligible to compete in the NCAA tournament, no team in the country has played in more Final Fours.

Williams teams to win national titles since Williams began participating in NCAA tournaments in 1994 include women&#x27;s crew (nine titles, including eight straight from 2006 to 2013), men&#x27;s tennis (four), women&#x27;s tennis (nine, including six straight from 2008 to 2013), women&#x27;s soccer (three, 2015, 2017–18), men&#x27;s cross country (two), women&#x27;s cross country (three), men&#x27;s basketball, women&#x27;s indoor track and field (two), women&#x27;s golf (2015), and men&#x27;s soccer (1995). The Men&#x27;s Crew team won the inaugural DIII IRA championship in 2022.

Williams has won the NACDA Director&#x27;s Cup 22 of the 24 years since its inception, including 13 years in a row from 1999 through 2011.

Williams also has an active club and intramural sports program, offering 14 club sports including ultimate, rugby, horseback riding, cycling, fencing, volleyball, gymnastics, sailing, and water polo. Approximately 50% of Williams&#x27;s students compete on at least one varsity, junior varsity, or formal club team.

===Athletic facilities===
Williams College has had major updates or renovations of its athletic facilities during the past several decades.

The Lansing Chapman hockey rink, built in 1953 and originally uncovered, was canopied in 1963, enclosed in 1969 and has been periodically upgraded to the present (2014) with rink, roof, locker room and lighting improvements.

The Towne Field House, constructed in 1970, is a multipurpose facility, which includes an indoor track, tennis courts and a climbing wall. The last was initially constructed in 1974 and updated to a state of the art climbing wall in 1995. Towne Field House&#x27;s track was resurfaced in 2019. The field house also accommodates pre-season baseball, softball and lacrosse.

The Lasell Gym built in 1886 was renovated and expanded with the addition of the Chandler Athletic Center in 1987. It provides a state of the art 50-meter swimming pool, a gymnasium primarily for basketball, squash facilities, wrestling rooms, various fitness centers and administrative offices.

In 1987, the Weston Field cinder running track and baseball field were replaced: the Anthony Plansky 400-meter track was built around the refurbished football field and the Bobby Coombs baseball field was re-located at Cole Field. The Renzi Lamb Field for lacrosse and field hockey, built with artificial turf, was added to Weston Field in 2004.

In November 2013 Williams College began its $22 million renovation of the Weston Field complex. This upgrade includes an artificial turf football field, relocation of the Plansky Track and Lamb Field, new bleachers, improved lighting and the addition of support buildings for the athletes. The completed facility, which reopened in September 2014, allows year round athletic events and practice.

==People==

===Student body===
Williams enrolled 2,121 undergraduate students and 50 graduate students in 2021. Women constituted 51.6% of undergraduate students and 56.0% percent of graduate students. 48% of students received need-based financial aid averaging $63,516 in 2021, and 20% qualified to receive Pell Grants. The median family income of Williams students is $185,800, the third-highest in Massachusetts, with 55% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 20% from the bottom 60%.

===Alumni===

The Society of Alumni of Williams College is the oldest existing alumni society of any academic institution in the United States. The Society of Alumni was founded during the &quot;Amherst crisis&quot; in 1821, when Williams College President Zephaniah Swift Moore left Williams. Graduates of Williams formed the Society to ensure that Williams would not have to close, and raised enough money to ensure the future survival of the school. This fund formed by alumni served as the first college endowment in the United States, and as a result, Williams has maintained a legacy of high alumni involvement.

There are 30,699 living alumni of record, and 69 regional alumni associations nationwide and overseas. Alumni participation in the 2018-19 Alumni Fund was 54.1%. More than 61% of the alumni from the classes of 1980 to 2000 have earned at least one graduate or professional degree. The most popular graduate disciplines for alumni are management, education, law, and health care.

Prominent alumni include 9 Pulitzer Prize winners, 2 Nobel Prize laureates, a Fields medalist, a Lasker award recipient, 16 billionaires, 71 members of the United States Congress, 22 U.S. Governors, 4 U.S. Cabinet secretaries, an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, a President of the United States, 3 prime ministers, CEOs and founders of Fortune 500 companies, multiple Emmy, Oscar, Tony, and Grammy award winners, and professional athletes. Other notable alumni include 40 Rhodes Scholars and 17 Marshall Scholarship recipients.

<text>William Nunn Lipscomb Jr. (December 9, 1919April 14, 2011) was a Nobel Prize-winning American inorganic and organic chemist working in nuclear magnetic resonance, theoretical chemistry, boron chemistry, and biochemistry.

==Biography==

===Overview===

Lipscomb was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to a physician father and housewife mother. Both his grandfather and great-grandfather had been physicians. His family moved to Lexington, Kentucky in 1920, and he lived there until he received his Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry at the University of Kentucky in 1941. He went on to earn his Doctor of Philosophy degree in chemistry from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1946.

From 1946 to 1959 he taught at the University of Minnesota. From 1959 to 1990 he was a professor of chemistry at Harvard University, where he was a professor emeritus since 1990.

Lipscomb was married to the former Mary Adele Sargent from 1944 to 1983. They had three children, one of whom lived only a few hours.
He married Jean Evans in 1983. They had one adopted daughter.

Lipscomb resided in Cambridge, Massachusetts until his death in 2011 from pneumonia.

===Early years===

&quot;My early home environment ... stressed personal responsibility and self reliance. Independence was encouraged especially in the early years when my mother taught music and when my father&#x27;s medical practice occupied most of his time.&quot;

In grade school Lipscomb collected animals, insects, pets, rocks, and minerals.

Interest in astronomy led him to visitor nights at the Observatory of the University of Kentucky, where Prof. H. H. Downing gave him a copy of Baker&#x27;s &quot;Astronomy.&quot;
Lipscomb credits gaining many intuitive physics concepts from this book and from his conversations with Downing, who became Lipscomb&#x27;s lifelong friend.

The young Lipscomb participated in other projects, such as Morse-coded messages over wires and crystal radio sets, with five nearby friends who became physicists, physicians, and an engineer.

Aged 12, Lipscomb was given a small Gilbert chemistry set. He expanded it by ordering apparatus and chemicals from suppliers and by using his father&#x27;s privilege as a physician to purchase chemicals at the local drugstore at a discount. Lipscomb made his own fireworks and entertained visitors with color changes, odors, and explosions. His mother questioned his home chemistry hobby only once, when he attempted to isolate a large amount of urea from urine.

Lipscomb credits perusing the large medical texts in his physician father&#x27;s library and the influence of Linus Pauling years later to his undertaking biochemical studies in his later years. Had Lipscomb become a physician like his father, he would have been the fourth physician in a row along the Lipscomb male line.

===Education===
Lipscomb&#x27;s high-school chemistry teacher, Frederick Jones, gave Lipscomb his college books on organic, analytical, and general chemistry, and asked only that Lipscomb take the examinations.
During the class lectures, Lipscomb in the back of the classroom did research that he thought was original (but he later found was not): the preparation of hydrogen from sodium formate (or sodium oxalate) and sodium hydroxide.
He took care to include gas analyses and to search for probable side reactions.

Lipscomb later had a high-school physics course and took first prize in the state contest on that subject. He also became very interested in special relativity.

Lipscomb attended University of Kentucky on a music scholarship. Prof. Robert H. Baker suggested that Lipscomb research the direct preparation of derivatives of alcohols from dilute aqueous solution without first separating the alcohol and water, which led to Lipscomb&#x27;s first publication.

For graduate school Lipscomb chose Caltech, which offered him a teaching assistantship in Physics at $20/month. He turned down more money from Northwestern University, which offered a research assistantship at $150/month. Columbia University rejected Lipscomb&#x27;s application in a letter written by Nobel prizewinner Prof. Harold Urey.

At Caltech Lipscomb intended to study theoretical quantum mechanics with Prof. W. V. Houston in the physics department, but after one semester switched to the chemistry department under the
influence of Prof. Linus Pauling. World War II work divided Lipscomb&#x27;s time in graduate school beyond his other thesis work, as he partly analyzed smoke particle size, but mostly worked with nitroglycerin–nitrocellulose propellants, which involved handling vials of pure nitroglycerin on many occasions.
Brief audio clips by Lipscomb about his war work may be found from the External Links section at the bottom of this page, past the References.

==Scientific studies==

Lipscomb worked in three main areas, nuclear magnetic resonance and the chemical shift, boron chemistry and the nature of the chemical bond, and large biochemical molecules. These areas overlap in time and share some scientific techniques.
In at least the first two of these areas Lipscomb gave himself a big challenge likely to fail,
and then plotted a course of intermediate goals.

===Nuclear magnetic resonance and the chemical shift===
In this area Lipscomb proposed that:
&quot;... progress in structure determination, for new polyborane species and for substituted boranes and carboranes, would be greatly accelerated if the [boron-11] nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, rather than X-ray diffraction, could be used.&quot;
This goal was partially achieved, although X-ray diffraction is still necessary to determine many such atomic structures. The diagram at right shows a typical nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of a borane molecule.

Lipscomb investigated, &quot;... the carboranes, C2B10H12, and the sites of electrophilic attack on these compounds using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This work led to [Lipscomb&#x27;s publication of a comprehensive] theory of chemical shifts. The calculations provided the first accurate values for the constants that describe the behavior of several types of molecules in magnetic or electric fields.&quot;

Much of this work is summarized in a book by Gareth Eaton and William Lipscomb, &quot;NMR Studies of Boron Hydrides and Related Compounds&quot;, one of Lipscomb&#x27;s two books.

===Boron chemistry and the nature of the chemical bond===

In this area Lipscomb originally intended a more ambitious project: &quot;My original intention in the late 1940s was to spend a few years understanding the boranes, and then to discover a systematic valence description of the vast numbers of electron deficient intermetallic compounds. I have made little progress toward this latter objective. Instead, the field of boron chemistry has grown enormously, and a systematic understanding of some of its complexities has now begun.&quot;
Examples of these intermetallic compounds are KHg13 and Cu5Zn7. Of perhaps 24,000 of such compounds the structures of only 4,000 are known (in 2005) and we cannot predict structures for the others, because we do not sufficiently understand the nature of the chemical bond.
This study was not successful, in part because the calculation time required for intermetallic compounds was out of reach in the 1960s, but intermediate goals involving boron bonding were achieved, sufficient to be awarded a Nobel Prize.


The three-center two-electron bond is illustrated in diborane (diagrams at right).
In an ordinary covalent bond a pair of electrons bonds two atoms together, one at either end of the bond, the diboare B-H bonds for example at the left and right in the illustrations.
In three-center two-electron bond a pair of electrons bonds three atoms (a boron atom at either end and a hydrogen atom in the middle), the diborane B-H-B bonds for example at the top and bottom of the illustrations.

Lipscomb&#x27;s group did not propose or discover the three-center two-electron bond,
nor did they develop formulas that give the proposed mechanism.
In 1943, Longuet-Higgins, while still an undergraduate at Oxford, was the first to explain
the structure and bonding of the boron hydrides. The paper reporting the work, written with his tutor R. P. Bell,
 also reviews the history of the subject beginning with the work of Dilthey.
 Shortly after, in 1947 and 1948, experimental spectroscopic work was performed by Price
that confirmed Longuet-Higgins&#x27; structure for diborane. The structure was re-confirmed by electron diffraction measurement in 1951 by K. Hedberg and V. Schomaker, with the confirmation of the structure shown in the schemes on this page. Lipscomb and his graduate students further determined the molecular structure of boranes (compounds of boron and hydrogen) using X-ray crystallography in the 1950s and developed theories to explain their bonds. Later he applied the same methods to related problems, including the structure of carboranes (compounds of carbon, boron, and hydrogen). Longuet-Higgins
and Roberts
discussed the electronic structure of an icosahedron of boron atoms and of the borides MB6. The mechanism of the three-center two-electron bond was also discussed in a later paper by Longuet-Higgins, and an essentially equivalent mechanism was proposed by Eberhardt, Crawford, and Lipscomb.
Lipscomb&#x27;s group also achieved an understanding of it through electron orbital calculations using formulas by Edmiston and Ruedenberg and by Boys.

The Eberhardt, Crawford, and Lipscomb paper discussed above also devised the &quot;styx rule&quot; method to catalog certain kinds of boron-hydride bonding configurations.

Wandering atoms was a puzzle solved by Lipscomb in one of his few papers with no co-authors.
Compounds of boron and hydrogen tend to form closed cage structures.
Sometimes the atoms at the vertices of these cages move substantial distances with respect to each other.
The diamond-square-diamond mechanism (diagram at left) was suggested by Lipscomb to explain this rearrangement of vertices.
Following along in the diagram at left for example in the faces shaded in blue,
a pair of triangular faces has a left-right diamond shape.
First, the bond common to these adjacent triangles breaks, forming a square,
and then the square collapses back to an up-down diamond shape
by bonding the atoms that were not bonded before.
Other researchers have discovered more about these rearrangements.


The B10H16 structure (diagram at right) determined by Grimes, Wang, Lewin, and Lipscomb found a bond directly between two boron atoms without terminal hydrogens, a feature not previously seen in other boron hydrides.

Lipscomb&#x27;s group developed calculation methods, both empirical and from quantum mechanical theory.
Calculations by these methods produced accurate Hartree–Fock self-consistent field (SCF) molecular orbitals and were used to study boranes and carboranes.

The ethane barrier to rotation (diagram at left) was first calculated accurately by Pitzer and Lipscomb using the Hartree–Fock (SCF) method.

Lipscomb&#x27;s calculations continued to a detailed examination of partial bonding through &quot;... theoretical studies of multicentered chemical bonds including both delocalized and localized molecular orbitals.&quot;
This included &quot;... proposed molecular orbital descriptions in which the bonding electrons are delocalized over the whole molecule.&quot;

&quot;Lipscomb and his coworkers developed the idea of transferability of atomic properties, by which approximate theories for complex molecules are developed from more exact calculations for simpler but chemically related molecules...&quot;

Subsequent Nobel Prize winner Roald Hoffmann was a doctoral student

in Lipscomb&#x27;s laboratory.
Under Lipscomb&#x27;s direction the Extended Hückel method of molecular orbital calculation was developed by Lawrence Lohr and by Roald Hoffmann. This method was later extended by Hoffman.
In Lipscomb&#x27;s laboratory this method was reconciled with self-consistent field (SCF) theory by Newton and by Boer.

Noted boron chemist M. Frederick Hawthorne conducted early and continuing research with Lipscomb.

Much of this work is summarized in a book by Lipscomb, &quot;Boron Hydrides&quot;, one of Lipscomb&#x27;s two books.

The 1976 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Lipscomb &quot;for his studies on the structure of boranes illuminating problems of chemical bonding&quot;.
In a way this continued work on the nature of the chemical bond by his doctoral advisor at the California Institute of Technology, Linus Pauling, who was awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize in Chemistry &quot;for his research into the nature of the chemical bond and its application to the elucidation of the structure of complex substances.&quot;

===Large biological molecule structure and function===

Lipscomb&#x27;s later research focused on the atomic structure of proteins, particularly how enzymes work.
His group used x-ray diffraction to solve the three-dimensional structure of these proteins to atomic resolution, and then to analyze the atomic detail of how the molecules work.

The images below are of Lipscomb&#x27;s structures from the Protein Data Bank displayed in simplified form with atomic detail suppressed. Proteins are chains of amino acids, and the continuous ribbon shows the trace of the chain with, for example, several amino acids for each turn of a helix.

Carboxypeptidase A (left) was the first protein structure from Lipscomb&#x27;s group. Carboxypeptidase A is a digestive enzyme, a protein that digests other proteins. It is made in the pancreas and transported in inactive form to the intestines where it is activated. Carboxypeptidase A digests by chopping off certain amino acids one-by-one from one end of a protein.
The size of this structure was ambitious. Carboxypeptidase A was a much larger molecule than anything solved previously.

Aspartate carbamoyltransferase. (right) was the second protein structure from Lipscomb&#x27;s group.
For a copy of DNA to be made, a duplicate set of its nucleotides is required. Aspartate carbamoyltransferase performs a step in building the pyrimidine nucleotides (cytosine and thymidine). Aspartate carbamoyltransferase also ensures that just the right amount of pyrimidine nucleotides is available, as activator and inhibitor molecules attach to aspartate carbamoyltransferase to speed it up and to slow it down.
Aspartate carbamoyltransferase is a complex of twelve molecules.
Six large catalytic molecules in the interior do the work, and six small regulatory molecules on the outside control how fast the catalytic units work.
The size of this structure was ambitious. Aspartate carbamoyltransferase was a much larger molecule than anything solved previously.

Leucine aminopeptidase, (left) a little like carboxypeptidase A, chops off certain amino acids one-by-one from one end of a protein or peptide.

HaeIII methyltransferase (right)
binds to DNA where it methylates (adds a methy group to)
it.

Human interferon beta (left)
is released by lymphocytes in response to pathogens to trigger the immune system.

Chorismate mutase (right)
catalyzes (speeds up) the production of the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine.

Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (left)
and its inhibitor MB06322 (CS-917)
were studied by Lipscomb&#x27;s group in a collaboration, which included Metabasis Therapeutics, Inc., acquired by Ligand Pharmaceuticals in 2010, exploring the possibility of finding a treatment for type 2 diabetes, as the MB06322 inhibitor slows the production of sugar by fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase.
Lipscomb&#x27;s group also contributed to an understanding of
concanavalin A (low resolution structure),
glucagon, and
carbonic anhydrase (theoretical studies).

Subsequent Nobel Prize winner Thomas A. Steitz
was a doctoral student in Lipscomb&#x27;s laboratory.
Under Lipscomb&#x27;s direction, after the training task of determining the structure of the small molecule methyl ethylene phosphate, Steitz made contributions to determining the atomic structures of carboxypeptidase A


and aspartate carbamoyltransferase.

Steitz was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for determining the even larger structure of the large 50S ribosomal subunit, leading to an understanding of possible medical treatments.

Subsequent Nobel Prize winner Ada Yonath, who shared the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Thomas A. Steitz and Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, spent some time in Lipscomb&#x27;s lab where both she and Steitz were inspired to pursue later their own very large structures. This was while she was a postdoctoral student at MIT in 1970.

===Other results===
The mineral lipscombite (picture at right) was named after Professor Lipscomb by the mineralogist John Gruner who first made it artificially.

Low-temperature x-ray diffraction was pioneered in Lipscomb&#x27;s laboratory at about the same time as parallel work in Isadore Fankuchen&#x27;s laboratory at the then Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn.
Lipscomb began by studying compounds of nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and other substances that are solid only below liquid nitrogen temperatures, but other advantages eventually made low-temperatures a normal procedure.
Keeping the crystal cold during data collection produces a less-blurry 3-D electron-density map because the atoms have less thermal motion. Crystals may yield good data in the x-ray beam longer because x-ray damage may be reduced during data collection and because the solvent may evaporate more slowly, which for example may be important for large biochemical molecules whose crystals often have a high percentage of water.

Other important compounds were studied by Lipscomb and his students.
Among these are
hydrazine,
nitric oxide,
metal-dithiolene complexes,
methyl ethylene phosphate,
mercury amides,
(NO)2,
crystalline hydrogen fluoride,
Roussin&#x27;s black salt,
(PCF3)5,
complexes of cyclo-octatetraene with iron tricarbonyl,
and leurocristine (Vincristine), which is used in several cancer therapies.

<text>The Worldwatch Institute was a globally focused environmental research organization based in Washington, D.C., founded by Lester R. Brown. Worldwatch was named as one of the top ten sustainable development research organizations by Globescan Survey of Sustainability Experts.

Brown left to found the Earth Policy Institute in 2000. The institute terminated in 2017, after publication of its last &quot;State of the World Report&quot;. Worldwatch.org was unreachable from mid 2019.

==Mission==
The mission of the Institute read: &quot;Through research and outreach that inspire action, the Worldwatch Institute works to accelerate the transition to a sustainable world that meets human needs. The Institute&#x27;s top mission objectives are universal access to renewable energy and nutritious food, expansion of environmentally sound jobs and development, transformation of cultures from consumerism to sustainability, and an early end to population growth through healthy and intentional childbearing.&quot;

The Worldwatch Institute aimed to inform policymakers and the public about the links between the world economy and its environmental support systems. Research conducted by the institute was integrative or interdisciplinary and global in scope.

Worldwatch&#x27;s priority programs included: 
*Building a low-carbon energy system that dramatically reduces the use of fossil fuels and lowers greenhouse gas emissions.
*Nourishing the Planet - methods that create a sustainable food production system that provides a healthy, nutritious diet for all while sustaining the land, water, and biological resources on which life depends. The project resulted in the Worldwatch Institute&#x27;s flagship publication, &quot;State of the World 2011: Innovations that Nourish the Planet&quot;.
*Transforming economies, cultures, and societies that meets human needs, promotes prosperity, and is in harmony with nature.

Worldwatch also monitored human health, population, water resources, biodiversity, governance, and environmental security.

==History==

<text>Wendy Carlos (born Walter Carlos; November 14, 1939) is an American musician and composer best known for electronic music and film scores.

Born and raised in Rhode Island, Carlos studied physics and music at Brown University before moving to New York City in 1962 to study music composition at Columbia University. Studying and working with various electronic musicians and technicians at the city&#x27;s Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center, she helped in the development of the Moog synthesizer, Robert Moog&#x27;s first commercially available keyboard instrument.

Carlos came to prominence with &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot; (1968), an album of music by Johann Sebastian Bach performed on a Moog synthesizer, which helped popularize its use in the 1970s and won her three Grammy Awards. Its commercial success led to several more albums, including further synthesized classical music adaptations, and experimental and ambient music. She composed the score to two Stanley Kubrick films, &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1971) and &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980), and for &quot;Tron&quot; (1982) for Walt Disney Productions.

In 1979, Carlos raised public awareness of transgender issues by disclosing she had been living as a woman since at least 1968, and in 1972 had undergone sex reassignment surgery.

, much of Carlos&#x27;s discography is out of print, and has not been licensed for digital distribution to streaming or download platforms.

== Early life ==
Carlos was born in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, to working-class parents Clarence and Mary Carlos Her parents married in 1937 and Carlos was the first of two children. Her mother played the piano and sang; one uncle played the trombone and another played the trumpet and drums. She began piano lessons at age six, and wrote her first composition, &quot;A Trio for Clarinet, Accordion, and Piano&quot;, at age ten.

Carlos attended St. Raphael Academy, a Catholic high school in Pawtucket. In 1953, at fourteen, Carlos won a scholarship by building a computer presented at the Westinghouse Science Fair, a science competition for high-school students. From 1958 to 1962, Carlos studied at Brown University and graduated with a degree in music and physics, during which she taught lessons in electronic music at informal sessions.

== Career ==

=== 1960s ===
In 1965, Carlos graduated from Columbia University with a master&#x27;s degree in music composition, and assisted Leonard Bernstein in presenting an evening of electronic music at the Philharmonic Hall. Carlos studied with Vladimir Ussachevsky and Otto Luening, two pioneers of electronic music in the 1960s. They were based in the Columbia–Princeton Electronic Music Center in New York City, the first of its kind in the United States. After Ussachevsky suggested to Carlos that she work in a recording studio to support herself, Carlos began working as a recording and mastering engineer at Gotham Recording Studios in New York City; she worked in this position until 1968. She called it &quot;a really lovely occupation&quot; and found it a useful learning experience.

During her time at Columbia, Carlos met Robert Moog at the 1964 Audio Engineering Society show, which began a partnership. Carlos ordered custom-designed synthesizer modules from Moog, and gave him extensive advice and technical assistance in the development of what became the Moog synthesizer, Moog&#x27;s new electronic instrument. She convinced Moog to add a touch-sensitive keyboard for greater musical dynamics, among other improvements. Moog recounted that Carlos fed back extensive and very detailed—but always constructive—criticism about his equipment, presenting him with suggestions for improvements to every module, including the shapes and dimensions of the cases. Moog credited Carlos with originating many features of his synthesizer, and that many features that became part of the final production model of the Moog synthesizer originated with the custom modules he created for her, including the touch-sensitive keyboard, a portamento control, a fixed filter bank, and a 49-oscillator polyphonic generator bank that could create chords and arpeggios.

By 1966 Carlos owned a small Moog synthesizer, which she used to record sound effects and jingles for television commercials, which earned her &quot;anywhere from $100 to $1000&quot;. In 1967, Carlos met and befriended fellow Gotham Recorders employee Rachel Elkind, a former singer who had a jazz and musical theatre background and had worked as a secretary for Goddard Lieberson, then-president of Columbia Records. Although their initial meetings were somewhat confrontational (Elkind initially found Carlos &quot;arrogant&quot;), they eventually became friends and began sharing a home, studio, and business premises in a brownstone building in the West Side of Manhattan in New York City.

Carlos recorded several compositions in the 1960s as a student at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center. Two of them were re-recorded and released on &quot;By Request&quot; (1975), &quot;Dialogues for Piano and Two Loudspeakers&quot; (1963) and &quot;Episodes for Piano and Electronic Sound&quot; (1964), both featuring Phillip Ramey on piano. A third, &quot;Variations for Flute and Electronic Sounds&quot; (1964, featuring John Heiss on flute) was recorded and released in 1965 on a Turnabout Records &quot;Electronic Music&quot; compilation. Other known, but unreleased student compositions include &quot;Episodes for Piano and Tape&quot; (1964), &quot;Pomposities for Narrator and Tape&quot; (1965), and &quot;Noah&quot; (1965), a two-hour opera blending electronics with an orchestra. Carlos&#x27;s first commercial release was &quot;Moog 900 Series – Electronic Music Systems&quot; (1967), an introduction to the technical aspects of the Moog synthesizer released as a nine-minute single-sided mono LP and narrated by Ed Stokes.

Part of her compensation for making the recording was in Moog equipment, and in part payment for her various other contributions to Moog&#x27;s product development, and for articles she wrote for his short-lived electronic music periodical, she was able to acquire additional Moog equipment at a discount, most of it custom-designed to her specific requirements. By the time Carlos began recording &quot;Switched On Bach&quot; she had built a home studio valued at around US$12,000 (approx. $100,000 in 2023) (although, given the unique nature of most of the modules, and their provenance, the 2023 value of her studio equipment would likely be far higher).

Her home studio, crucially, included an eight-track recorder that Carlos had built herself (because she was unable to afford a factory-made machine), using parts from Ampex and EMI recorders, with the addition of Ampex&#x27;s patented &quot;Sel-Sync&quot; system, which enabled recorded signals to be monitored via the record head, rather than the playback head, thus permitting multiple tracks to be kept in perfect synchronisation. Carlos was also one of the earliest adopters of the Dolby noise reduction system, which she used for her final two-track masters.

====&quot;Switched-On Bach&quot;====

In 1968, Carlos released &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot;, an album formed of several pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach performed on a Moog modular synthesizer. Carlos had originally wanted to record an album of her own music, but Elkind suggested that they use music that was more familiar to the general listener in order to introduce the synthesizer as a credible new instrument. The idea for an album of Bach&#x27;s music performed on the Moog began to crystallize during 1967, after Carlos asked Elkind to listen to some recordings by Carlos and musicologist Benjamin Folkman made up to ten years prior at the Electronic Music Center, one of them being Bach&#x27;s Two-Part Invention in F major, which Elkind took a liking to. Plans for an album of several Bach compositions developed from there.

From her experience working in the music industry, Elkind knew that a major label would be unlikely to accept a pitch from a woman, so she approached her friend, the musician, conductor and producer Ettore Stratta, who was then a producer working in the A&amp;R division at Columbia Records. He successfully pitched the project to the label on their behalf, leading to a two-album recording contract with Columbia Masterworks, a deal that lasted until 1986. Crucially, it gave Carlos and Elkind ownership of their recording masters, and Elkind was able to negotiate what she described as &quot;a very nice royalty&quot;, possibly because the label did not have to invest a large sum up-front, and did not expect that the album would sell many copies.

Columbia had launched an album sales campaign named &quot;Bach to Rock&quot;, though it had no album of Bach&#x27;s works in a contemporary context in its catalogue. They were given a small advance from the label; Elkind recalled they were offered $1000, Carlos told an interviewer they were given about $2500, a relatively modest sum, given that the average recording budget for a major pop album at this time was about $10,000. Columbia granted Carlos and Elkind artistic freedom to produce and release the album. Carlos performs with additional synthesizers played by Folkman and with Elkind as producer.

The recording process was long and complex, because the monophonic Moog could only play one note at a time. Due to the limitations of her equipment, every instrumental part in each score had to be recorded separately, and then each successive part was layered over the previously recorded parts on Carlos&#x27; eight-track recorder. All the parts were coordinated by recording each one in time with a click track, which was eventually erased. Biographer Amanda Sewell reports that Carlos only rarely wrote down the complex combination of control knob settings and cable connections (or &quot;patches&quot;) used to create specific sounds on the Moog, and that she was able to memorize and recall nearly her entire &quot;library&quot; of patches at will.

This tortuous recording process was made even more difficult by the tendency of the early Moog oscillators to drift out of tune—by her own account, Carlos was often only able to record one or two measures of each part before the Moog went out of tune, and she claimed she sometimes even had to bang on the casing with a hammer to get it back into tune. This issue also meant that she had to meticulously review each segment for consistency once it had been recorded, because if one line was out of tune the entire section would be ruined.

Carlos later recalled that she worked on the recording of the album for eight hours a day, five days a week, for five months, on top of her regular 40-hour-per-week day job at Gotham Studios. Although &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot; was extremely costly in terms of person-hours expended, her high-quality home studio, her proficiency as a programmer and performer on the Moog, and her ability as a recording engineer enabled Carlos and her colleagues to record and produce the album completely independently, thereby avoiding the need to use expensive commercial recording studios. As well as the consideration that repeatedly taking the bulky, complex and delicate Moog system to and from a studio for each session would have been almost impossible, given Carlos&#x27; own reckoning that the project took over 1100 hours to complete, using commercial studios would have made the recording prohibitively expensive, and would likely have cost upwards of US$100,000 in 1968. By comparison, The Beatles&#x27; 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; took over 700 hours to record and cost a reported UK£25,000, or about US$60,000 at the 1968 exchange rate. Additionally, although the recording was extremely labour-intensive, the combination of the Moog and the multitrack recorder gave Carlos and Elkind unprecedented control over every facet of the timbral, expressive and environmental qualities of every single note they recorded, enabling them to create a new level of clarity for each &quot;voice&quot; in the compositions—a key concern for Elkind, who was critical of what she called the &quot;soggy&quot; audio quality of contemporary classical recordings.

Released in October 1968, &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot; became an unexpected commercial and critical hit, with Glenn Gould calling it &quot;the album of the decade&quot;, and it helped to draw attention to the synthesizer as a genuine musical instrument. A Canadian Broadcasting Corporation program in November 1968, called CBC AM, secured a rare interview with Carlos about the selection and use of Moog. Biographer Amanda Sewell observes, it is notable that Carlos is not pictured anywhere on the album, and is only mentioned by name (as Walter Carlos) in the rear sleeve notes of the original cover. &quot;Newsweek&quot; dedicated a full page to Carlos with the caption &quot;Plugging into the Steinway of the future&quot;. It peaked at No. 10 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and was No. 1 on its Classical Albums chart from January 1969 to January 1972. It was the second classical album to sell over one million copies and was certified Gold in 1969 and Platinum in 1986 by the Recording Industry Association of America. Carlos performed selections from the album on stage with a synthesizer with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra.

The massive and unexpected success of &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot; put great pressure on Carlos. She was by this time well into her gender confirmation process, and she was fearful of both personal ridicule and physical attack, and of the negative impact that her status as a transitioning person could have on her music career. Biographer Amanda Sewell records that the St. Louis appearance was extremely difficult for her—she hated having to disguise herself as Walter, for which she had to affect a deeper voice, use makeup to simulate a five o&#x27;clock shadow, and don a wig and pasted-on fake sideburns. Her childhood experiences of being bullied and assaulted made her so fearful of appearing in public that she reportedly even contemplated taking her own life before the event and cried all the way to St. Louis.
This was to be one of only two live performances Carlos made following her days as a student, the other being with the Kurzweil Baroque Ensemble for &quot;Bach at the Beacon&quot; in 1997.

In 1970, the album won a Grammy Award for Best Classical Album, Best Classical Performance – Instrumental Soloist or Soloists (With or Without Orchestra), and Best Engineered Classical Recording. Carlos released a follow-up, &quot;The Well-Tempered Synthesizer&quot;, with synthesized pieces from multiple composers. Released in November 1969, the album reached No. 199 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and received two Grammy nominations. The success of both albums allowed Carlos to move into Elkind&#x27;s more spacious New York City home in 1971.

Carlos considers Elkind&#x27;s contribution to her work, and specifically &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot;, to be underappreciated, calling her &quot;a &#x27;silent&#x27; partner&quot; and her work &quot;critical to my success&quot;.

=== 1970s ===
After the release of &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot;, Carlos was invited to compose the soundtrack of two science fiction films, &quot;Marooned&quot; (1969), directed by John Sturges, and &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1971), directed by Stanley Kubrick. When the directors of &quot;Marooned&quot; changed their minds about including a soundtrack, Carlos chose to work with Kubrick, as she and Elkind were fans of his previous films, adding: &quot;We finally wound up talking with someone who had a close connection to Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s lawyer. We suddenly got an invitation to fly to London.&quot; Before Carlos knew about the offer, she read the book and began writing a piece based on it named &quot;Timesteps&quot;. A soundtrack containing only the film cuts of the score was released as &quot;Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s Clockwork Orange&quot; in 1972, combining synthesized and classical music by Henry Purcell, Beethoven and Gioacchino Rossini with an early use of a vocoder. Later that year, Carlos released an album of music not included in the final score titled &quot;Walter Carlos&#x27; Clockwork Orange&quot;, which peaked on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at No. 146. Carlos later described the project as &quot;a lot of fun ... a pleasurable venture&quot;.

Carlos experimented with ambient music on her third studio album &quot;Sonic Seasonings&quot;, released as a double album in 1972, with one side-long track dedicated to each of the four seasons. Recorded as early as 1970 and finished in mid-1971, before the &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; project was complete, Carlos wished to produce music that did not require &quot;lengthy concentrated listening&quot;, but more than a collection of ambient noises to portray an environment. It combined field recordings of animals and nature with synthesized sounds, occasionally employing melodies, to create soundscapes. It reached No. 168 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and influenced other artists who went on to pursue the ambient and new-age genres in later years.

By 1973, Columbia/CBS Records had received a considerable number of requests for Carlos to produce another album of synthesized classical music. She agreed to the request, opting to produce a sequel to &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot;, which began with her and Elkind seeking compositions that were most suitable for the synthesizer; the two picked selections from Suite No. 2 in B minor, Two-Part Inventions in A minor and major, Suite from Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach, and Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 in D major. The latter features a Yamaha E-5 Electone organ for certain passages, as a reliable polyphonic keyboard had not been developed. The result, &quot;Switched-On Bach II&quot;, was released in 1973 and sold over 70,000 copies in the US during the first five weeks of its release.

Following &quot;Switched-On Bach II&quot;, Carlos changed musical directions once more. In 1971, she and Elkind had asked Columbia Records to attach a pre-paid business reply card in each new pressing of her albums, which resulted in a considerable amount of suggestions from the public regarding the subject of her future releases. The ideas received were divided; some asked for more classical adaptations, while others wanted more of Carlos&#x27;s original compositions. Carlos decided, &quot;If I was going to spend months for mere minutes of music, I certainly wasn&#x27;t going to be pigeonholed into only retreading existing music&quot;, and so began a process of &quot;re-directing new ideas, reworking old ones&quot;. By mid-1974, Carlos and Elkind had selected tracks of varying styles to record on the Moog synthesizer, which Carlos found liberating, as it demonstrated the flexibility of the instrument. Released as &quot;By Request&quot; in 1975, the album includes pieces from Bach, Wagner, Tchaikovsky, two of Carlos&#x27;s compositions from the 1960s, and renditions of &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; by The Beatles and &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot;, originally sung by Tom Jones. The latter track, featuring some 40 tracks of overdubbed synthesiser, was one of the pieces that Carlos had unsuccessfully presented to Elkind in 1967 when they were planning what became &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot;. The final track, entitled &quot;Pompous Circumstances&quot;, a &quot;witty and serious&quot; set of variations based on themes by Edward Elgar (see &quot;Pomp and Circumstance&quot;), was replaced by CBS with tracks from &quot;The Well-Tempered Synthesizer&quot; on UK pressings after members of Elgar&#x27;s estate refused to have his music presented in this style, which &quot;devastated&quot; Carlos. Between 1974 and 1980 she scored several short films for producer Dick Young for UNICEF (seven of which were released in 2005 on &quot;Rediscovering Lost Scores, Vol.1&quot;).

&quot;By Request&quot; was followed by &quot;Switched-On Brandenburgs&quot;, a double album containing all six of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Brandenburg Concertos&quot; played on a synthesizer, in 1980.

=== 1980s ===
Carlos reunited with Kubrick to compose the score for his psychological horror film &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980). Before filming began, Carlos and Elkind read the book, as per Kubrick&#x27;s suggestion, for musical inspiration. Carlos recorded a complete electronic score for the film, but Kubrick ended up using mostly existing recordings by several avant-garde composers, tracks that he had used as guide tracks during editing. Carlos and Elkind did not discover this until they were invited to a screening of the film in May 1980, and they were reportedly furious about Kubrick&#x27;s actions. Their experience closely mirrored that of composer Alex North, who had written and recorded a complete orchestral soundtrack for Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, but discovered at the film&#x27;s world premiere that Kubrick had jettisoned the entire score in favour of the guide tracks he had used while editing the movie.

&quot;The Shining (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)&quot;, released in 1980 on Warner Bros. Records, featured only two tracks credited to Carlos and Elkind: the main title theme and &quot;Rocky Mountains&quot;, the former a reinterpretation of the &quot;Dies Irae&quot; section of &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; by Hector Berlioz. Biographer Amanda Sewell discovered that Carlos and Elkind&#x27;s agent Lucy Kroll had written a note in her files indicating that the duo had initially considered suing Kubrick, but Sewell found that, several pages further on, Kroll had written another note that read &quot;No signed contract&quot;—Carlos and Elkind had made the deal with Kubrick &quot;on a handshake&quot;, and thus had no legal recourse. Some of Carlos&#x27;s music had some legal issues regarding its release, but much of it was made available in 2005 as part of her two-volume compilation album &quot;Rediscovering Lost Scores&quot;.

With work on &quot;The Shining&quot; complete, Elkind ended her long-time collaboration with Carlos when she moved to France with her husband in 1980. Carlos remained in New York City, sharing a converted loft in Greenwich Village with her new business partner Annemarie Franklin. It housed her new, remodelled studio, which was enclosed in a Faraday cage to shield the equipment from white noise and outside interference from radio and television signals.

Carlos&#x27;s first project with Franklin began around 1980, when The Walt Disney Company asked her to record the soundtrack to its science fiction feature &quot;Tron&quot; (1982). Carlos agreed, but was not interested in composing solely with electronic music, as she wished to incorporate an orchestra with her musical ideas. She recalled their demands were &quot;tightly specified ... there wasn&#x27;t a lot of elbow room, and that made it fun&quot;. The score incorporated Carlos&#x27;s analog and digital synthesizers with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the UCLA Chorus, and the Royal Albert Hall Organ. &quot;Tron: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; was released in 1982 and reached No. 135 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Carlos intended to release her scores on her own album, but Columbia/CBS showed a lack of interest in the prospect.

Three studio albums from Carlos were released in the 1980s. The first was &quot;Digital Moonscapes&quot; in 1984, Carlos&#x27;s first to only feature digital synthesizers. She wrote the album&#x27;s tracks for orchestra &quot;or orchestra replica&quot;, inspired by various astronomical subjects, which used some leftover material from her score to &quot;Tron&quot;. Soon after, Carlos secured a deal with Audion Records, a smaller label, as she wished to &quot;get away from that kind of big, monolithic government-like aspect that [she] had dealt with for so many years&quot;. In 1986, Audion released &quot;Beauty in the Beast&quot;, which saw Carlos experiment with just intonation, Balinese scales, and four new microtonal scales she devised for the album: harmonic, alpha, beta, and gamma. The album features the first instance of a 35-note octave. Carlos considers the album as the most important of her career. She followed the album with &quot;Secrets of Synthesis&quot; in 1987, her final album for CBS/Columbia, featuring several introductions and demonstrations of synthesized music from Carlos with audio examples from her previous albums.

In 1988, CBS Records asked Carlos to collaborate with comical musician &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic to release a parody of &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; by Sergei Prokofiev. Carlos agreed to the project, as she felt it presented a chance &quot;to let your sense of humor out of the cage&quot;. Yankovic adapted and narrated its story, while Carlos rearranged the music with a &quot;MIDI orchestra&quot;, her first venture using the digital interface. The album&#x27;s second side also contains a humorous adaptation of &quot;The Carnival of the Animals&quot; by Camille Saint-Saëns titled &quot;The Carnival of the Animals—Part II&quot;, with Yankovic providing funny poems for each of the featured animals in the style of poet Ogden Nash, who did similar for the original. Released in October 1988, &quot;Peter and the Wolf/Carnival of the Animals—Part II&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Album for Children in 1989.

=== 1990s–2000s ===
To mark the 25th anniversary of &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot;, Carlos re-recorded the album with her set of digital instruments and recording techniques. Released in 1992 on Telarc Records, &quot;Switched-On Bach 2000&quot; took roughly one and a half years to produce; Carlos estimated around 3,000 hours were invested in the project, which involved using several digital audio workstation software packages, including Pro Tools. A Moog synthesizer is only used once on the record; the rest is performed on 13 modern synthesizers. The album also marked her first venture into mixing in Dolby Surround sound.

Carlos wrote the soundtrack to the British film &quot;Brand New World&quot; (1998), also known as &quot;Woundings&quot;, directed by Roberta Hanley and based on a play by Jeff Noon. Carlos explained the style of her music: &quot;I was given fairly large carte blanche to do some horrific things and also some inside-psyche mood paintings, and that&#x27;s what the film became&quot;.

In 1998, Carlos released her most recent studio album, &quot;Tales from Heaven and Hell&quot;, for the East Side Digital label.

Beginning in 1998, Carlos digitally remastered her studio albums, culminating in the &quot;Switched-On Box Set&quot; released in 1999 featuring her four synthesized classical albums.

In 2005, the two-volume set &quot;Rediscovering Lost Scores&quot; was released, featuring previously out-of-print material, including the unreleased soundtrack to &quot;Woundings&quot; and music recorded for &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, &quot;The Shining&quot;, and &quot;Tron&quot; that was not used in the films.

== Personal life ==

=== Gender transition ===
Carlos became aware of her gender dysphoria at an early age, recalling: &quot;I was about five or six... I remember being convinced I was a little girl, much preferring long hair and girls&#x27; clothes, and not knowing why my parents didn&#x27;t see it clearly&quot;. While at Brown, she went on a date with a girl and felt &quot;so jealous of her I was beside myself&quot;.

Sometime after entering graduate school at Columbia University in the fall of 1962, she encountered studies of transgender issues for the first time, which explained to her what she was feeling. In the summer of 1966, New York sexologist and pioneering transsexual advocate Harry Benjamin published his landmark book &quot;The Transsexual Phenomenon&quot;, and, in the fall of 1967, Carlos began counseling with him (well before &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot;).

By early 1968, Carlos had begun hormone replacement treatment under Benjamin&#x27;s care, which began altering her appearance. That created some problems for Carlos when &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot; became an unexpected hit after its release in October 1968.

Prior to a live performance of excerpts from the album with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, Carlos felt terrified about appearing in public. She cried in her hotel room, before putting on fake sideburns and a man&#x27;s wig, and drawing on facial hair with an eyebrow pencil to appear more masculine. She did the same thing again when she met Kubrick, and for an appearance on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; in 1970.

Finally, the commercial success of &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot; allowed Carlos the funds to undergo sex reassignment surgery in May 1972, although for marketing reasons she released two more albums as Walter Carlos (1973&#x27;s &quot;Switched-On Bach II&quot; and 1975&#x27;s &quot;By Request&quot;).

Carlos disclosed her transgender status in a series of interviews with Arthur Bell held between December 1978 and January 1979, published in the May 1979 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. She explained in &quot;Playboy&quot; that she had &quot;always been concerned with liberation, and [I was] anxious to liberate myself&quot;. In 1985, Carlos spoke about the reaction to her transition: &quot;The public turned out to be amazingly tolerant or, if you wish, indifferent... There had never been any need of this charade to have taken place. It had proven a monstrous waste of years of my life.&quot;

The first album released after the &quot;Playboy&quot; interview, &quot;Switched-On Brandenburgs&quot; (1980), and all subsequent releases and re-releases, have been issued under the name Wendy Carlos.

=== Lawsuit ===
In 1998, Carlos sued the songwriter/artist Momus for $22 million regarding the song &quot;Walter Carlos&quot; (from the album &quot;The Little Red Songbook&quot;, released that year), which postulated that after the sex reassignment surgery Wendy could travel back in time to marry her pre-transition self, Walter. The case was settled out of court, with Momus agreeing to remove the song from subsequent editions of the CD and owing $30,000 in legal fees.

=== Published biography ===
A biography by musicologist Amanda Sewell, &quot;Wendy Carlos: A Biography&quot;, was published by Oxford University Press in 2020. Although the author was unable to secure on-the-record interviews with the artist or anyone close to her, it was positively received by critics. On her personal website, Carlos describes the work as &quot;fiction&quot; that mischaracterizes her life and deceased parents.

== Awards and honors ==
&quot;Switched-On Bach&quot; was the winner of three Grammy Awards at the 1970 ceremony:
* Album of the Year, Classical
* Best Classical Performance – Instrumental Soloist Or Soloists (With Or Without Orchestra)
* Best Engineered Recording, Classical

Carlos received three additional nominations for Best Classical Performance – Instrumental Soloist Or Soloists (With Or Without Orchestra) and Best Engineered Recording, Classical for &quot;The Well-Tempered Synthesizer&quot;, and Best Recording for Children for &quot;Peter And The Wolf/Carnival Of The Animals (Part II)&quot;.

In 2005, Carlos was the recipient of the SEAMUS Lifetime Achievement Award &quot;in recognition of lifetime achievement and contribution to the art and craft of electro-acoustic music&quot; by the Society for Electro-Acoustic Music in the United States.

Carlos is the first transgender recipient of a Grammy Award.

== Other activities ==
Carlos contributed a review of the then-available synthesizers to the June 1971 edition of the &quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot;, contrasting the Moog, Buchla and Tonus (aka ARP) systems. She was dismissive of smaller systems like the EMS Putney and the Minimoog as &quot;toys&quot; and &quot;cash-ins&quot;.

Carlos is also an accomplished solar eclipse photographer. Her work has been published online by NASA and has appeared on the cover of &quot;Sky &amp; Telescope&quot;. She has developed various techniques for the extension of dynamic range in eclipse photography by the use of darkroom techniques and digital composites.

<text>w3m is a free and open source text-based web browser licensed under the MIT license. It differs from other text-based browsers by supporting elements such as tables, frames, and images.

== History ==
The name &quot;w3m&quot; stands for &quot;&quot;, which is Japanese for &quot;to see the WWW&quot;, and where &quot;W3&quot; is a numeronym of &quot;WWW&quot;. The original project is no longer active, but an active version is being maintained by a different developer, Tatsuya Kinoshita.

== Functions ==
w3m runs in terminal emulator programs such as xterm and GNOME Terminal. The browser has tabbed browsing, right click menus, and image support, along with support for tables and frames. It also functions as a terminal pager. It can be navigated solely using the keyboard or with the mouse. There are two different display modes, one with colors and one that is monochrome.

w3m can be used within Emacs.

Some distributions require the installation of a second package, w3m-img, to render images using w3m.

<text>William Gilbert Grace (18 July 1848 – 23 October 1915) was an English cricketer who is widely considered one of the sport&#x27;s all-time greatest players. Always known by his initials as &quot;WG&quot;, his first-class career spanned a record-equalling 44 seasons from 1865 to 1908. Test cricket originated during his career, and he represented England in 22 matches from 1880 to 1899. In domestic cricket, he was mostly associated with Gloucestershire, the Gentlemen, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), and the United South of England Eleven (USEE).

Right-handed as both batsman and bowler, Grace was an outstanding all-rounder who excelled at all the essential skills of batting, bowling, and fielding, though it is for his batting that he is most renowned, as he is held to have invented modern batsmanship. He dominated the sport during his career, and his technical innovations and enormous influence have left a lasting legacy. Usually opening the innings, he was particularly admired for his mastery of all strokes, and his level of expertise was said by contemporary reviewers to be unique. He generally captained the teams he played for at all levels because of his skill and tactical acumen. Grace nominally held amateur status as a player, but he was said to have made more money from his cricketing activities than any contemporary professional. He was an extremely competitive player and, though he was one of the most famous men in England, he was also one of the most controversial on account of his gamesmanship and moneymaking.

He came from a cricketing family which included his elder brother Edward (&quot;EM&quot;), and his younger brother Fred. In 1880, they were members of the same England team, the first time three brothers played together in a Test match. Grace took part in other sports—as a young man, he was a champion 440-yard hurdler, and played football for the Wanderers. In later life, he developed enthusiasm for golf, lawn bowls, and curling. He qualified as a medical practitioner in 1879.

==Early years==
===Family===

Grace was born in Downend, near Bristol, on 18 July 1848 at his parents&#x27; home, Downend House, and was baptised at the local church on 8 August. He was called Gilbert in the family circle, except by his mother, who apparently called him Willie, but otherwise, as &quot;WG&quot;, he was universally known by his initials. His parents were Henry Mills Grace and Martha (&quot;née&quot; Pocock), who were married in Bristol on Thursday, 3 November 1831 and lived out their lives at Downend, where Henry Grace was the local GP. Downend is near Mangotsfield and, although it is now a suburb of Bristol, it was then a detached village surrounded by countryside, and about four miles from Bristol. Henry and Martha Grace had nine children in all. Biographer Simon Rae commented that this was &quot;the same number as Victoria and Albert—and in every respect they were the typical Victorian family&quot;. Grace was the eighth child in the family; he had three older brothers, including Edward (always known as &quot;EM&quot;), and four older sisters. The ninth child was his younger brother Fred, born in 1850.

===Education===
Grace was &quot;notoriously unscholarly&quot;. His first schooling was with a Miss Trotman in Downend village and then with a Mr Curtis of Winterbourne. He subsequently attended a day school called Ridgway House, run by a Mr Malpas, until he was fourteen. One of his schoolmasters, David Bernard, later married Grace&#x27;s sister Alice. In 1863, Grace was taken seriously ill with pneumonia and his father removed him from Ridgway House. After this illness, Grace grew rapidly to his full height of 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m). He continued his education at home where one of his tutors was the Reverend John Dann, the Downend parish church curate; like Mr Bernard before him, Mr Dann became Grace&#x27;s brother-in-law, marrying Blanche Grace in 1869.

Grace never went to university because his father wanted him to pursue a medical career. Nevertheless, Grace received approaches from both Oxford University Cricket Club and Cambridge University Cricket Club. In 1866, when he played a match at Oxford, one of the Oxford players, Edmund Carter, tried to interest him in becoming an undergraduate. Then, in 1868, Grace received overtures from Caius College, Cambridge, which had a long medical tradition. Grace said he would have gone to either Oxford or Cambridge if his father had allowed it. Instead, he enrolled at Bristol Medical School in October 1868, when he was 20.

Grace&#x27;s entire life, including his cricket and medical careers, is inseparable from his close-knit family background which was strongly influenced by his father, who set great store by qualifications and determination to succeed. Henry, whose medical qualifications were Licenciate of the Society of Apothecaries (LSA) in 1828 and Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons (MRCS) in 1830, passed this purposeful attitude on to each of his five sons. Therefore, like his father and his brothers, Grace chose a professional career in medicine—because of his cricketing commitments, however, he did not complete his qualification as a doctor until 1879, when he was 31 years old.

===Development as a cricketer===

Grace began his &quot;Cricketing Reminiscences&quot; (1899) by answering a question he had frequently been asked—&quot;was he born a cricketer&quot;? His answer was in the negative because he believed that &quot;cricketers are made by coaching and practice&quot;, though he added that if he was not born a cricketer, he was born &quot;in the atmosphere of cricket&quot;. His father and mother were &quot;full of enthusiasm for the game&quot; and it was &quot;a common theme of conversation at home&quot;. In 1850, when WG was two and Fred was expected, the family moved to a nearby house called &quot;The Chesnuts&quot; which had a sizeable orchard and Henry Grace organised clearance of this to establish a practice pitch. All nine children in the Grace family, including the four daughters, were encouraged to play cricket although the girls, along with the dogs, were required for fielding only. Grace claimed that he first handled a cricket bat at the age of two.

It was in the Downend orchard and as members of their local cricket clubs that he and his brothers developed their skills, mainly under the tutelage of their uncle, Alfred Pocock, who spent long hours coaching them at Downend. EM, who was seven years older than WG, had always played with a full size bat and so developed a tendency, that he never lost, to hit across the line, the bat being too big for him to &quot;play straight&quot;. Pocock recognised this problem and determined that WG and Fred should not follow suit. He therefore fashioned smaller bats for them, to suit their sizes, and they were taught to play straight and &quot;learn defence, with the left shoulder well forward&quot;, before attempting to hit. Apart from his cricket and his schooling, Grace lived the life of a country boy and roamed freely with the other village boys. One of his regular activities was stone throwing at birds in the fields and he later claimed that this was the source of his eventual skill as an outfielder.

Henry Grace founded Mangotsfield Cricket Club in 1845 to represent several neighbouring villages including Downend. In 1846, this club merged with the West Gloucestershire Cricket Club whose name was adopted until 1867; it has been said that the Grace family ran the West Gloucestershire &quot;almost as a private club&quot;. Henry Grace managed to organise matches against Lansdown Cricket Club in Bath, which was the premier West Country club. West Gloucestershire fared poorly in these games and, sometime in the 1850s, Henry Grace and Alfred Pocock decided to join Lansdown, although they continued to run the West Gloucestershire and this remained their primary club.

Grace recorded in his &quot;Reminiscences&quot; that he saw his first &quot;great&quot; cricket match in 1854 when he was barely six years old, the occasion being a game between William Clarke&#x27;s All-England Eleven (the AEE) and twenty-two of West Gloucestershire. He first played for the West Gloucestershire club himself as early as 1857, when he was nine years old, and he had eleven innings in 1859. The first time he made a substantial score was in July 1860 when he scored 51 for West Gloucestershire against Clifton—forty years later, he said no innings ever gave him more pleasure.

It was through Grace&#x27;s elder brother EM, however, that the family name first became famous. Their mother, Martha, wrote the following in a letter to William Clarke&#x27;s successor George Parr in 1860 or 1861:

I am writing to ask you to consider the inclusion of my son, E. M. Grace—a splendid hitter and most excellent catch—in your England XI. I am sure he would play very well and do the team much credit. It may interest you to learn that I have another son, now twelve years of age, who will in time be a much better player than his brother because his back stroke is sounder, and he always plays with a straight bat.

Grace was just short of his thirteenth birthday when, on 5 July 1861, he made his debut for Lansdown and played two matches that month. EM had made his debut in 1857, aged sixteen. In August 1862, aged 14, Grace played for West Gloucestershire against a Devonshire team. A year later, following the bout of pneumonia which had left him bed-ridden for several weeks, he scored 52 not out and took five wickets to help Gentlemen of Gloucestershire defeat Gentlemen of Somerset by 87 runs at the Sydenham Field ground in Bath. Soon afterwards, he was one of four family members who played for a Bristol and Didcot XVIII against the All-England Eleven. He scored 32 off the bowling of John Jackson, George Tarrant, Cris Tinley, and Ned Willsher—before Tinley bowled him. EM took ten wickets in the match, which Bristol and Didcot won by an innings, and as a result EM was invited to tour Australia a few months later with George Parr&#x27;s England team.

EM did not return from Australia until July 1864 and his absence presented Grace with an opportunity to appear on cricket&#x27;s greatest stages. He and his elder brother Henry were invited to play for the South Wales team which had arranged a series of matches in London and Sussex, though Grace wondered humorously how they were qualified to represent South Wales. It was the first time that Grace left the West Country and he made his debut appearances at both The Oval and Lord&#x27;s.

Besides his cricketing skills, Grace was an outstanding athlete as a young man and took part in several meetings. He threw a cricket ball during a field event at Eastbourne. He won the hurdling title at the National Olympian Games at Crystal Palace in August 1866, and claimed the silver medal in the quarter-mile event at the 1869 AAC Championships. Also, Grace is known to have played football for the Wanderers, although he did not feature in any of their FA Cup-winning teams.

==First-class career==
===Gentlemen v Players===

Having scored 5 and 38 for South Wales in his first match at The Oval, Grace was outstanding in the next match, scoring 170 and 56* against Gentlemen of Sussex at the Royal Brunswick Ground in Hove. The innings of 170 was his first-ever century in a serious match. The third match, against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) was Grace&#x27;s debut at Lord&#x27;s, and he was joined there by EM who had just disembarked from his voyage. Grace scored 50 in the first innings, only three days after his sixteenth birthday.

His name now well known in cricketing circles, Grace played for Gentlemen of the South against Players of the South in June 1865, when he was still only 16 but already tall and weighing . This match is recognised as his first-class debut. Gentlemen of the South, batting first, won the match by an innings and 58 runs. Grace was out, stumped, without scoring but he bowled extremely well and had match figures of 13 for 84 to earn his first selection for the Gentlemen v Players fixture.

During this period, before the start of Test cricket in 1877, Gentlemen v Players was the most prestigious fixture in which a player could take part. This is apart from North v South, which was technically a fixture of higher quality given that the amateur Gentlemen were usually (until Grace took a hand) outclassed by the professional Players. Grace was to represent the Gentlemen in their matches against the Players from 1865 to 1906. It was he who enabled the amateurs to meet the paid professionals on level terms and to defeat them more often than not. His ability to master fast bowling was the key factor. Before Grace&#x27;s debut in the fixture, the Gentlemen had lost 19 consecutive games; of the next 39 games, they won 27 and lost only 4. In seven consecutive innings against the Players from 1871 to 1873, Grace scored 217, 77, 112, 117, 163, 158 and 70. In his whole career, he scored a record 15 centuries in the fixture.

His 1865 debut for the Gentlemen did not turn the tide as the Players won at The Oval by 118 runs. He had been selected as a bowler and took seven wickets in the match. Batting late in the order, he scored 23 and 12*. In the second 1865 match, this time at Lord&#x27;s, the Gentlemen finally ended their losing streak and won by 8 wickets, but it was EM who made the difference with 11 wickets in the match. Even so, Grace made his mark by scoring 34 out of 77/2 in the second innings to steer the Gentlemen to victory.

===&quot;The Champion&quot;===
Cricket in the 1860s underwent a revolution with the legalisation of overarm bowling in June 1864, and Grace himself said it was &quot;no exaggeration to say that, between 1860 and 1870, English cricket passed through its most critical period&quot; with the game in transition, and &quot;it was quite a revolutionary period so far as its rules were concerned&quot;. He was still 15 when the 1864 season began and had turned 20 when he began his medical career by enrolling at Bristol Medical School on 7 October 1868. During those five seasons, and especially in 1866, he became widely recognised as the finest cricketer in England. Just after his eighteenth birthday in July 1866, he confirmed his potential with an innings of 224* for All-England against Surrey at The Oval. It was his maiden first-class century and, according to Harry Altham, he was &quot;thenceforward the biggest name in cricket and the main spectator attraction with the successes (coming) thick and fast&quot;.

Two years later, Grace scored two centuries in a match, only the second time in cricket history that this is known to have been done, following William Lambert in 1817. Summarising the 1868 season, Simon Rae wrote that Grace was: 

Now indisputably the cricketer of the age, the Champion.

Grace had numerous nicknames during his career including &quot;The Doctor&quot;, after he achieved his medical qualification, and &quot;The Old Man&quot;, as he reached the veteran stage. &quot;The Champion&quot; was the most auspicious—in the poem &quot;At Lord&#x27;s&quot; by Francis Thompson, he was hailed as &quot;The Champion of the Centuries&quot;. Grace was first acclaimed as the &quot;Champion Cricketer&quot; by &quot;Lillywhite&#x27;s Companion&quot; in recognition of his exploits in 1871.

===MCC membership===
Grace became a member of MCC in 1869 after being proposed by the treasurer, Thomas Burgoyne, and seconded by the secretary, Robert Allan Fitzgerald. Given an ongoing rift in the sport during the 1860s between the northern professionals and Surrey, MCC feared the loss of its authority should Grace &quot;throw in his lot with the professionals&quot; so it was considered vital for them and their interests to get him onside. As it happens, the dispute was nearly over but it has been said that &quot;MCC regained its authority over the game by hanging onto WG&#x27;s shirt-tails&quot;. Grace wore MCC colours for the rest of his career, playing for them on an irregular basis until 1904, and their red and yellow hooped cap became as synonymous with him as his large black beard. He played for MCC on an expenses only basis, but any hopes the club had of keeping him firmly within the amateur ranks would soon be disappointed for his services were much in demand.

Grace scored four centuries in July 1869, including an innings of 180 at The Oval. That was achieved as part of the highest wicket partnership involving Grace in his entire career: he shared 283 runs for the first wicket with Bransby Cooper. Later in the month, Grace scored 122 out of 173 in difficult batting conditions during a North v South match at Bramall Lane, prompting the laconic Tom Emmett to call him a &quot;nonsuch&quot; (without equal), and declare: &quot;He ought to be made to play with a littler bat&quot;.

===Gloucestershire===
It is generally understood that Gloucestershire County Cricket Club was formally constituted in 1870, having developed from Dr Henry Grace&#x27;s West Gloucestershire club. Gloucestershire acquired first-class status when its team played against Surrey at Durdham Down on 2, 3 and 4 June 1870. With Grace and his brothers EM and Fred playing, Gloucestershire won by 51 runs. The club soon had one of the best teams in England and was unanimously rated Champion County in 1876 and 1877, as well as sharing the unofficial title in 1873 and staking a claim for it in 1874. Surrey and Gloucestershire played a return match at The Oval in July 1870, and Gloucestershire won it by an innings and 129 runs. Grace scored 143, sharing a second wicket partnership of 234 with Frank Townsend, who scored 89. The Grace family &quot;ran the show&quot; at Gloucestershire and EM was chosen as secretary which, as Derek Birley pointed out, &quot;put him in charge of expenses, a source of scandal that was to surface before the end of the decade&quot;. WG, though aged only 21, was from the start the team captain and Birley put that down to his &quot;commercial drawing power&quot;.

Grace, a medical student at the time, was first on the scene in June 1870, when George Summers received the blow on the head that caused his death four days later. This was in the MCC v Nottinghamshire match at Lord&#x27;s. Grace was fielding nearby when Summers was struck, and took his pulse. Summers recovered consciousness and Grace advised him to leave the field. Summers did not go to hospital, but it transpired later that his skull had been fractured. The Lord&#x27;s pitch had a poor reputation for being rough, uneven, and unpredictable all through the 19th century and many players including Grace considered it dangerous.

It was in 1870 that, as Birley put it, Grace &quot;scorned the puny modern fashion of moustaches&quot; and grew the enormous black beard that made him so recognisable. In addition, his &quot;ample girth&quot; had developed for he weighed 15 stone (95 kg) in his early twenties. Grace was a non-smoker but he enjoyed good food and wine; many years later, when discussing the overheads incurred during Lord Sheffield&#x27;s profitless tour of Australia in 1891–92, Arthur Shrewsbury commented: &quot;I told you what wine would be drunk by the amateurs; Grace himself would drink enough to swim a ship&quot;.

===&quot;Annus mirabilis&quot;===

According to Harry Altham, 1871 was Grace&#x27;s &quot;annus mirabilis&quot;. In all first-class matches in 1871, a total of seventeen centuries were scored and Grace accounted for ten of them, including the first in a first-class match at Trent Bridge. He averaged 78.25 runs per innings, and the next best average by a batsman playing more than a single innings was 39.57, barely more than half his figure. His aggregate for the season was 2,739 runs—the first time anyone had scored 2,000 first-class runs in a season—and the next highest was Harry Jupp with 1,068.

Grace produced two outstanding batting performances in the season. Playing for the Single against the Married at Lord&#x27;s, Grace carried his bat to score 189*. He and his brother Fred shared a third wicket partnership of 108. The innings was played on a &quot;sticky wicket&quot; after rain, and many people considered it the finest of Grace&#x27;s career, though Grace himself disagreed. He began cautiously and took fifteen minutes to score his first run but then, as Rae put it, he &quot;scored at a cracking pace&quot;. MCC Secretary Harry Perkins had no doubts and insisted that it was Grace&#x27;s greatest-ever performance with rain frequently stopping play and making the wicket at times &quot;unplayable&quot;. Later, when he represented the South against the North at The Oval, he made his highest career score to date of 268, having been dismissed by Jem Shaw for nought in the first innings. It was to no avail as the match was drawn, but the occasion produced a memorable and oft-quoted comment by Shaw who ruefully said: &quot;I puts the ball where I likes, and he puts it where he likes&quot;. 

===The United South and the first overseas tour===
1871 was a great year for Grace on the field, but it was marred by the death of his father in December. Grace and his younger brother Fred still lived with their mother, who had been left just enough to retain the family home in Downend. As medical students (Fred started his course in the autumn of 1872), the brothers faced considerable outlay in addition to their living expenses, and it became imperative for them to make what they could out of cricket, especially the United South of England Eleven (USEE).

USEE had been formed by Ned Willsher in 1865 but the of the travelling teams was over and their organisers were desperate to feature new attractions. In 1872, USEE played six matches, including games in Edinburgh and Glasgow, Grace&#x27;s first visit to Scotland. 

The Graces had formally joined the club in 1870, playing for expenses only. As its match organisers, however, they also received wages. They had to find gaps in the first-class fixture list and then pull together a team to visit a location where a suitable profit could be made. It has been estimated that the standard fee paid to the USEE was £100 for a three-day match () with £5 (£) each going to the nine professionals in the team and the other £45 (£) to WG and Fred. Otherwise, Grace played for expenses but these were loaded as, for example, he is known to have claimed £15 per appearance for Gloucestershire and £20 for representing the Gentlemen. To put it in context, a domestic servant earned less than £50 a year.

1872 was a wet summer and Grace ended his season in early August so that he could join a tour of North America. He made three overseas tours during his career, and this first one was to the United States and Canada with R. A. Fitzgerald&#x27;s team in August and September 1872. All expenses were paid by the Montreal Club who had written to Fitzgerald the previous winter and invited him to form a team. Grace and his all-amateur colleagues made short work of the weak teams they faced. The team included two other future England captains in A. N. Hornby, who became a rival of Grace in later years; and the Honourable George Harris, the future Lord Harris, who became a very close friend and a most useful ally. The team met in Liverpool on 8 August and sailed on the SS &quot;Sarmatian&quot;, docking at Quebec on 17 August. Rae recounted that the bond between Grace and Harris was forged by their mutual sea-sickness. Matches were played in Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, London, New York, Philadelphia, and Boston. The team sailed back from Quebec on 27 September and arrived at Liverpool on 8 October. Grace wrote that the tour was &quot;a high point of (his) early years&quot; and he &quot;retained fond memories of it&quot; for the rest of his life, calling it &quot;a prolonged and happy picnic&quot; in his ghost-written &quot;Reminiscences&quot;.

===Towards a county championship===
1873 was the year that some semblance of organisation was brought into county cricket with the introduction of a residence qualification. This was aimed principally at England&#x27;s outstanding bowler James Southerton who had been playing for both Surrey and Sussex, having been born in one county and living in the other. Southerton chose to play for his county of residence, Surrey, from then on but remained the country&#x27;s top bowler. The counties agreed on residence but not on a means of deciding a County Championship and so the title, known as &quot;Champion County&quot;, remained an unofficial award by newspapers until 1890. Grace&#x27;s Gloucestershire had a very strong claim to this unofficial title in 1873 but consensus was that they shared it with Nottinghamshire. These two did not play each other and both were unbeaten in six matches, though Nottinghamshire won five and Gloucestershire won four.

Nottinghamshire and Gloucestershire were due to meet at the end of July, only for a row to erupt after Nottinghamshire requested a change of date. The Gloucestershire committee agreed to the new date, but Grace objected because he had promised to play in a benefit match at Sheffield for Yorkshire&#x27;s Joseph Rowbotham. The clubs insisted on the change, so the Graces closed ranks and refused to play, and the match was cancelled. That caused uproar among the Gloucestershire committee, where EM as club secretary found himself defending the family against multiple complaints of &quot;high-handedness&quot;. It changed nothing except that the entire committee boycotted the next meeting, so EM recorded himself as sole attendee in the minutes.

Grace had another outstanding season on the field in 1873, when he became the first player ever to complete the &quot;double&quot; of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in a season. He went on to do the double eight times in all from 1873 to 1886.

===English cricket dishonoured===
On 9 October 1873, Grace was married to Agnes Nicholls Day (1853–1930), who was the daughter of his first cousin William Day. Two weeks later, they began their honeymoon by taking ship to Australia for Grace&#x27;s 1873–74 tour. They returned from the tour in May 1874 with Agnes six months pregnant. Their eldest son William Gilbert junior (1874–1905) was born on 6 July. Grace had to catch up with his studies at Bristol Medical School, and he and his wife and son lived at Downend until February 1875 with his mother, brother Fred and sister Fanny.

The English team in Australia was called W. G. Grace&#x27;s XI. On the morning of their departure from Southampton, Grace responded to well-wishers by saying that his team &quot;had a duty to perform to maintain the honour of English cricket, and to uphold the high character of English cricketers&quot;. But both his and the team&#x27;s performances fell well short of this goal. The tour was not a success and the only positive outcome was the fact of it having taken place, ten years after the previous one, as it &quot;gave Australian cricket a much needed fillip&quot;. Most of the problems lay with Grace himself and his &quot;overbearing personality&quot;, which quickly exhausted all personal goodwill towards him. There was also bad feeling within the team itself because Grace, who normally got on well with professional players, enforced the class divide throughout the tour.

===Gloucestershire the Champion County===
Having toured Australia in the winter of 1873–74, Grace arrived in England on 18 May 1874 and was quickly back into domestic cricket. The 1874 season was very successful for him as he completed a second successive double. Gloucestershire again had a strong claim to the Champion County title although some sources have awarded it to Derbyshire, and Grace himself said that it should have gone to Yorkshire.

Another good season followed in 1875 when he again completed the double with 1,498 runs and 191 wickets, his most successful season as a bowler. The family moved to London in February 1875—after Grace was assigned to St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital—and lived at Earl&#x27;s Court, about five miles from the City. Their second son, Henry Edgar, was born there in July 1876.

One of the most outstanding phases of Grace&#x27;s career occurred in the 1876 season, beginning with his career highest score of 344 for MCC against Kent at the St Lawrence Ground, Canterbury, in August. Two days after his innings at Canterbury, he made 177 for Gloucestershire against Nottinghamshire, and two days after that 318* for Gloucestershire v Yorkshire, these two innings against counties with exceptionally strong bowling attacks. Thus, in three consecutive innings, Grace scored 839 runs and was only out twice. His innings of 344 was the first triple century scored in first-class cricket and broke the record for the highest individual score in all classes of cricket, previously held by William Ward, who had scored 278 in 1820. Ward&#x27;s record had stood for 56 years and, within a week, Grace bettered it twice. His 318* against Yorkshire was the record score in county cricket.

Gloucestershire were recognised as champions for the third and final time in 1877, largely thanks to another outstanding season by Grace who scored 1,474 runs and took 179 wickets. In the autumn of that year, the family moved back to Gloucestershire, where they lived with Grace&#x27;s elder brother Henry, who was a general practitioner. Grace&#x27;s studies had reached a crucial point with a theoretical backlog to catch up followed by his final practical session. Agnes became pregnant again at this time and their third child Bessie was born in May 1878.

===Like a wolf on the fold===
There was speculation that Grace intended to retire before the 1878 season to concentrate on his medical career, but he decided to continue playing cricket and may have been influenced by the arrival of the first Australian team to tour England in May. At Lord&#x27;s on 27 May, the Australians defeated a strong MCC team, including Grace, by nine wickets in a single day&#x27;s play. According to Chris Harte, news of the match &quot;spread like wildfire and created a sensation in London and throughout England&quot;. The satirical magazine &quot;Punch&quot; responded to it by publishing a parody of Byron&#x27;s poem &quot;The Destruction of Sennacherib&quot;, including a wry commentary on Grace&#x27;s contribution:

There was bad feeling between Grace and some of the 1878 Australians, especially their manager John Conway; this came to a head on 20 June in a row over the services of Grace&#x27;s friend Billy Midwinter, an Australian who had played for Gloucestershire in 1877. Midwinter was already in England before the main Australian party arrived and had joined them for their first match in May. On 20 June, Midwinter was at Lord&#x27;s where he was due to play for the Australians against Middlesex. On the same day, the Gloucestershire team was at The Oval to play Surrey but arrived a man short. As a result, a group of Gloucestershire players led by WG and EM went to Lord&#x27;s and persuaded Midwinter to accompany them back to The Oval and make up their numbers. Possibly, Midwinter was still under contractual obligation to Gloucestershire—the Australian press had reported this before the team embarked. They were pursued by three of the Australians who caught them at The Oval gates where a furious altercation ensued in front of bystanders. At one point, Grace called the Australians &quot;a damned lot of sneaks&quot; (he later apologised). In the end, Grace got his way and Midwinter stayed with Gloucestershire for the rest of the season. Afterwards, the row was patched up and Gloucestershire invited the Australians to play the county team at Clifton College—Midwinter, however, did not take part. The Australians took a measure of revenge and won easily by 10 wickets, with Fred Spofforth taking 12 wickets and making the top score. It was Gloucestershire&#x27;s first-ever home defeat.

Gloucestershire made their first visit to Old Trafford Cricket Ground in July 1878 to play Lancashire, and this was the match immortalised by Francis Thompson in his idyllic poem &quot;At Lord&#x27;s&quot;.
Despite his troubles in 1878, it was another good season for Grace on the field as he completed a sixth successive double. But the events at The Oval had a postscript during the following winter when he and EM were called to account by the Gloucestershire membership because of the expenses they had claimed from Surrey for that match, and which Surrey had refused to authorise.

===So-called gentlemen===

At the enquiry in January 1879, WG and EM were forced to answer charges that they had claimed &quot;exorbitant expenses&quot;, one of the few times that their money-making activity was seriously challenged. The Graces managed to survive &quot;a protracted and stormy meeting&quot; with EM retaining his key post as club secretary, although he was forced to liaise in future with a new finance committee and abide by stricter rules.

The incident highlighted an ongoing issue about the nominal amateur status of the Grace brothers. The amateur was, by definition, not paid, and the dictum of the amateur-dominated MCC was that &quot;a gentleman ought not to make any profit from playing cricket&quot;. Like all amateur players, they claimed expenses for travel and accommodation to and from cricket matches, but there is plenty of evidence that the Graces made more money from playing than reimbursement of actual expenses, and WG in particular &quot;made more than any professional&quot;. In his later years he had to pay for a &quot;locum tenens&quot; to run his medical practice while he was playing cricket; paradoxically, he had a reputation for treating his poorer patients without charging a fee. He was paid salaries for his management roles with both the USEE and the London County club. He was the recipient of two national testimonials. The first was presented to him by Lord Fitzhardinge at Lord&#x27;s on 22 July 1879 in the form of a marble clock, two bronze ornaments and a cheque for £1,458 (). The second, collected by MCC, the county of Gloucestershire, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Sportsman&quot;, amounted to £9,703 () and was presented to him in 1896 in appreciation of his &quot;Indian Summer&quot; season of 1895.

Whatever criticisms may be made of Grace for making money for himself out of cricket, he was &quot;punctilious in his aid when (professional players) were the beneficiaries&quot;. For example, he altered the date of a Gloucestershire match so that he could travel to Sheffield and take part in a Yorkshire player&#x27;s benefit match, knowing full well the impact that his appearance would have on the gate. John Arlott recorded, &quot;it was no uncommon sight to see outside a cricket ground&quot;:

On another occasion, when Alfred Shaw&#x27;s benefit match in 1879 was ruined by rain, Grace insisted on donating to Shaw the proceeds of another match that had been arranged to support Grace&#x27;s own testimonial fund. 1879 was a wet summer and, after the same thing happened to Ned Willsher&#x27;s benefit match, Grace took a select team to play Kent a few days later, the proceeds all going to Willsher.
===&quot;The Doctor&quot;===
Following the 1878 season, Grace was assigned to Westminster Hospital Medical School for the final practical of his medical qualification, so the family moved back to London and lived at Acton. The upheaval was worthwhile because, in November 1879, Grace finally received his diploma from the University of Edinburgh, having qualified as a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians (LRCP) and became a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons (MRCS).
After qualifying, he worked in his own practice at Thrissle Lodge, 61 Stapleton Road in Easton, a largely poor district of Bristol, employing two locums during the cricket season. He was the local Public Vaccinator and had additional duties as the Medical Officer to the Barton Regis Union, which involved tending patients in the workhouse. There are many testimonies from his patients that he was a good doctor, for example: &quot;Poor families knew that they did not need to worry about calling him in, as the bills would never arrive&quot;. The family lived at four different addresses close to the practice over the next twenty years, during which their fourth and last child Charles Butler was born.

With his commitments at Westminster Hospital, Grace missed a large part of the 1879 season and, for the first time since 1869, he did not complete 1,000 runs, though he did take 105 wickets. Having qualified, his new practice took priority for the next five years, with the result that his cricket sometimes had to be set aside. For example, he made only thirteen first-class appearances in 1881. He had other troubles including a serious bout of mumps in 1882. He never topped the seasonal batting averages in the 1880s, and he did not complete 1,000 runs in any of the 1879 to 1882 seasons.
Although the early matches were recognised retrospectively, Test cricket began in 1877 when Grace was already 28. He played for England in 22 Tests through the 1880s and 1890s, all of them against Australia. He was an automatic selection at home, but his only Test-playing tour was to Australia in 1891–92. Grace made his debut in 1880, scoring England&#x27;s first-ever Test century with an innings of 154 at The Oval in what is retrospectively recognised as the inaugural Test match in England. His brothers, EM and Fred, were also playing in that match, but Fred died soon afterwards from pneumonia.

Grace was badly upset by the early death of Fred, to whom he had been especially close despite their different characters. Fred&#x27;s demise has been seen as a major factor in the subsequent decline of the Gloucestershire team, there being a view that &quot;the county was never quite the same without him&quot;. Apart from WG himself, the only players of Fred&#x27;s calibre at the time were the leading professionals. Unlike the northern and south-eastern counties, Gloucestershire had neither the large home gates nor the necessary funds that could have secured the services of good quality professionals, a new generation of whom was emerging in the likes of Billy Gunn, Maurice Read, and Arthur Shrewsbury. As a result, Gloucestershire fell away in county competition and were no longer a match for Lancashire, Nottinghamshire, Surrey, or Yorkshire.

Grace was one of the England team that lost the &quot;Ashes Match&quot; at The Oval on 28 and 29 August 1882. Thanks to Spofforth, who took 14 wickets in the match, Australia won by 7 runs and the legend of &quot;The Ashes&quot; was born immediately afterwards. Grace, who scored 4 and 32, has been held responsible for &quot;firing up&quot; Spofforth. This came about through a typical piece of gamesmanship when Grace effected an unsporting, albeit legal, run out of Sammy Jones.

===Injury problems===
Grace&#x27;s medical career took priority his cricket career in 1883, and caused him to miss a Gentlemen v Players match for the first time since 1867. Recurring injury problems restricted his appearances in 1884, and it was in July of that year when Lancashire captain A. N. Hornby stopped play in a match at Old Trafford so that EM and WG could return home on receipt of a cable reporting the death of Mrs Martha Grace at the age of 72. 

Grace achieved his career-best bowling analysis of 10/49 when playing for MCC against Oxford University at The Parks in 1886; and he scored 104 in his only innings to complete a rare &quot;match double&quot;. This was the last season in which he took 100 wickets.
Playing for Gloucestershire against Yorkshire at Clifton in August 1888, Grace scored two centuries (148 and 153) in the match and, although it ended in a draw, he labelled it &quot;my champion match&quot;. He had reduced his bowling somewhat after 1886, and he became an occasional bowler only from 1889. More injury problems, particularly a bad knee, took their toll in the early 1890s and Grace had his worst season in 1891 when he scored no centuries and could only average 19.76.

===&quot;A bad loser&quot;===
Despite all these issues, patron Lord Sheffield had no doubts about Grace leading his England team on its 1891–92 1891–92 tour of Australia. Grace negotiated a considerable fee of £3,000 for himself, which included travel and accommodation for his wife and their youngest children. This overhead became a financial burden that terminated any chance of the tour returning a profit. In addition, several leading players declined to take part, largely because the offer to each of them was £300—a mere 10% of Grace&#x27;s fee—&quot;exclusive of alcohol and tobacco&quot;. The final team was something of a mixed bag and included at least three players who were not Test match standard.

Grace&#x27;s attitude and behaviour on the tour caused bad feeling. He was initially welcomed by the Australian press and public, but he ruined their goodwill by making controversial remarks and failing to control his temper. Australia, led by Jack Blackham, won the first Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground by 54 runs. Grace was enraged by the Australian batting tactics as Alec Bannerman in particular had resorted to &quot;stonewalling&quot; when conditions favoured the bowlers. This worked for Australia as they were able to extend play into a fifth day and were then able to bowl England out.

In the second Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground, Grace infuriated the Australians by refusing to allow a substitute fielder for the injured Harry Moses, who also had to bat without a runner. In addition, Grace angered his own team by some dubious captaincy decisions which eventually cost England both the match and the series. Having been 163 runs behind on first innings, Australia won the match by 72 runs. George Lohmann, who had bowled England into a strong position by taking 8/58 in Australia&#x27;s first innings, shouted that he would never play under Grace again.

Besides the incidents in the Test matches, Grace disputed a decision by umpire E. J. Briscoe when the tourists played New South Wales. This led to an enquiry which could not be resolved because Grace denied calling Briscoe a cheat. Before the final Test, Grace objected to the appointment of umpire Tom Flynn, who was widely respected in Australian cricket. Grace was acting out of pique and the result was that two inexperienced umpires stood in the match. 

Having won the first two Tests, Australia had taken the series and regained the Ashes. England had a consolation victory in the final Test, thanks to the bowling of Johnny Briggs who took 6/49 and 6/87. Grace was delighted with that result but the tour had been disastrous, and he would not accept any blame for it. Former Australian Test captain Tom Horan, writing as &quot;Felix&quot;, summarised the tour by saying:

Grace is a bad loser, and when he lost his temper too (after losing the first two Tests), he kept on losing it right to the finish.

Simon Rae pointed out that Grace at 43 had behaved just as badly as Grace at 25 on his first tour of Australia. He had not learned from his mistakes and &quot;simply repeated them&quot;, blithely assuming that he had nothing to apologise for.

===An Indian Summer===
Having eventually recovered from his injuries, Grace rallied somewhat to score 1,000 runs each season from 1892 to 1894. Even so, it was against all expectation that he produced in 1895 a season that has been called his &quot;Indian Summer&quot;. He completed what was then calculated to be his hundredth century, playing for Gloucestershire against Somerset in May. Charles Townsend, his batting partner when he reached the milestone, said that as he approached his hundred: &quot;This was the one and only time I ever saw him flustered&quot;. Eventually, Sammy Woods bowled a full toss which Grace drove for four to reach his century.

He then went on to score 1,000 runs in the month, the first time this had ever been done, with scores of 13, 103, 18, 25, 288, 52, 257, 73*, 18 and 169 totalling 1,016 runs between 9 and 30 May. His aggregate for the whole season was 2,346 at an average of 51.00 with nine centuries. Grace was aged forty-six at the start of the season. He was the sole recipient of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year award for 1896, the first of only three times that &quot;Wisden&quot; has restricted the award to a single player—there are normally five recipients.

Patrick Morrah began his study of cricket&#x27;s perceived &quot;Golden Age&quot; with Grace&#x27;s &quot;Indian Summer&quot; in 1895. Morrah praised Grace&#x27;s exploits as the &quot;central episode&quot; of what was, in any case, an important season—it began with the elevation of first-class cricket from a popular concept to an official standard.

===&quot;A bit too far away&quot;===

By the time of his fiftieth birthday in July 1898, Grace had developed a somewhat corpulent figure and had lost his former agility, which meant he was no longer a competent fielder. He remained a very good batsman and at need a useful slow bowler, but he was clearly entering the twilight of his career and was now generally referred to as &quot;The Old Man&quot;. As a special occasion, the MCC committee arranged the 1898 Gentlemen v Players match to coincide with his fiftieth birthday and he celebrated the event by scoring 43 and 31*, though handicapped by lameness and an injured hand.

During the 1899 season, Grace received an invitation from the Crystal Palace Company in London to help them form London County Cricket Club. He accepted to became the club&#x27;s secretary, manager, and captain with an annual salary of £600.

Grace captained England in the first Test of the 1899 series against Australia at Trent Bridge, when he was 51. By this time his bulk had made him a liability in the field and, afterwards, realising his limitations all too clearly, he decided to stand down and surrendered both his place and the captaincy to Archie MacLaren. It is evident that Grace &quot;plotted&quot; his own omission from the England team by asking C. B. Fry, another selector who had arrived late for their meeting, if he thought that MacLaren should play in the Second Test. Fry answered: &quot;Yes, I do&quot;. &quot;That settles it&quot;, said Grace, and he promptly retired from international cricket. Explaining his decision later, Grace ruefully admitted of his diminished fielding skills that &quot;the ground was getting a bit too far away&quot;.

===&quot;The Old Man&quot;===

After leaving Gloucestershire, the Graces lived in Mottingham, a south-east London suburb, not far from Crystal Palace Park where he played for London County, or from Eltham, where he played club cricket in his sixties. A blue plaque marks their residence, Fairmount, in Mottingham Lane. Grace and his wife suffered two tragic losses in this period. First, the loss of their daughter Bessie in 1899, aged only 20, from typhoid. She had been Grace&#x27;s favourite child. Then, in February 1905, their eldest son WG junior died of appendicitis at the age of 30.

London County played first-class matches from 1900 to 1904. Grace&#x27;s presence initially attracted other leading players into the team, including C. B. Fry, K. S. Ranjitsinhji, and Johnny Douglas, but the increased importance of the County Championship, combined with Grace&#x27;s inevitable decline in form and the lack of a competitive element in London&#x27;s matches, led to reduced attendances and consequently the club lost money. Nevertheless, Grace remained an attraction and could still produce good performances. As late as 1902, though aged 54 by the end of the season, he scored 1,187 runs in first-class cricket, with two centuries, at an average of 37.09. London&#x27;s final first-class matches were played in 1904 and the enterprise folded in 1908.

With the demise of London County as a first-class team, the number of Grace&#x27;s appearances dwindled over the next four seasons until he called it a day in 1908. His final appearance for the Gentlemen versus the Players was in July 1906 at The Oval, the match coinciding with his 58th birthday. When he began his second innings, the Gentlemen were expecting defeat but Grace saved the match, which ended in a draw, by scoring a dogged 74 runs. He was given a standing ovation as he left the field. That was his last &quot;big match&quot;, but he continued to make occasional first-class appearances until 20–22 April 1908 when he captained the Gentlemen of England against Surrey at The Oval, where, opening the innings, he scored 15 and 25.

==Later years==

Following the move to Mottingham, Grace became very interested in lawn bowls. He helped found an international competition with Scotland, Ireland and Wales, captaining England from the inaugural international at Crystal Palace in 1903 until 1908. He supported the pioneering all-female Womanhood Bowling Club at Crystal Palace by obtaining the use of a club pavilion for them in 1902. He was also keen on curling. His interest in golf brought him into intimate contact with one of his biographers Bernard Darwin, who said that Grace played golf &quot;with a mixture of keen seriousness and cheerful noisiness&quot;. He could drive straight and sometimes putt well but, for reasons that Darwin could not understand, &quot;he never could play an iron shot well&quot;.

Despite his age and bulk, Grace continued to play minor cricket for several years after his retirement from the first-class version. His penultimate match, and the last in which he batted, was for Eltham Cricket Club at Grove Park on 25 July 1914, a week after his 66th birthday. He contributed an undefeated 69 to a total of 155–6 declared, having begun his innings when they were 31/4. Grove Park made 99/8 in reply. The last match of any kind that Grace played in, though he neither batted nor bowled, was for Eltham v Northbrook on 8 August, a few days after the outbreak of the First World War.

On 26 August 1914, in response to news of casualties at the Battle of Mons, Grace wrote a letter to &quot;The Sportsman&quot; in which he called for the immediate closure of the county cricket season and for all first-class cricketers to set an example and serve their country. It was published next day but did not, as is often supposed, bring an immediate end to the cricket season as one further round of County Championship matches was played. Grace was reportedly distressed by the war and was known to shake his fist and shout at the German Zeppelins floating over his home in South London. When H. D. G. Leveson-Gower remonstrated that he had not allowed fast bowlers to unsettle him, Grace retorted: &quot;I could see those beggars; I can&#x27;t see these&quot;.

Grace died at Mottingham on 23 October 1915, aged 67, after suffering a heart attack. His death &quot;shook the nation almost as much as Winston Churchill&#x27;s fifty years later&quot;. He is buried in the family grave at Beckenham Cemetery, Kent.

==Style and technique==
===Approach to cricket===

Grace himself had much to say about how to play cricket in his two books &quot;Cricket&quot; (1891) and &quot;Reminiscences&quot; (1899), both of which were ghost-written. His fundamental opinion was that cricketers are &quot;not born&quot; but must be nurtured to develop their skills through coaching and practice; in his own case, he had achieved his skill through constant practice as a boy at home under the tutelage of his uncle Alfred Pocock.

Although the work ethic was of prime importance in his development, Grace insisted that cricket must also be enjoyable and freely admitted that his family all played in a way that was &quot;noisy and boisterous&quot; with much &quot;chaff&quot; (a Victorian term for teasing). WG and EM in particular were noted throughout their careers for being noisy and boisterous on the field—Fred was much quieter, and a less demonstrative character. They were extremely competitive and always playing to win. Sometimes this went to extremes—for example, on one occasion at school, EM was so upset about a decision going against him that he went home and took the stumps with him—and it developed into the gamesmanship for which EM and WG were always controversial.

Because of gamesmanship and insistence on his rights, as he saw them, Grace never enjoyed good relations with Australians in general, though he had personal friends like Billy Midwinter and Billy Murdoch. In 1874, an Australian newspaper wrote: &quot;We in Australia did not take kindly to WG. For so big a man, he is surprisingly tenacious on very small points. We thought him too apt to wrangle in the spirit of a duo-decimo lawyer over small points of the game&quot;.

He was just the same in England, and even his old friend Lord Harris agreed that &quot;his gamesmanship added to the fund of stories about him&quot;. One such story concerned Grace batting against Surrey in a match at Clifton. The ball lodged in his shirt after he had played it, and he seized the opportunity to complete several runs before the fielders forced him to stop. He disingenuously claimed that he would have been out handled the ball if he had removed it and, following a discussion, it was agreed that three runs should be awarded.

The point was that Grace &quot;approached cricket as if he were fighting a small war&quot; and he was &quot;out to win at all costs&quot;. The Australians recognised this. Joe Darling, when touring England for the first time in 1896, said: &quot;We were all told not to trust the Old Man as he was out to win every time and was a great bluffer&quot;.

===Batting===
With regard to Grace&#x27;s batsmanship, C. L. R. James held that the best analysis of his style and technique was written by another top-class batsman, K. S. Ranjitsinhji, in his &quot;Jubilee Book of Cricket&quot; (1897; co-written with C. B. Fry).

Ranjitsinhji wrote that Grace &quot;revolutionised batting (by converting) it from an accomplishment into a science&quot;. Before him, batsmen would play either forward or back and make a speciality of a certain stroke. Grace &quot;made utility the criterion of style&quot; and incorporated both forward and back play into his repertoire of strokes, favouring only that which was appropriate to the ball being delivered at the moment. In an oft-quoted phrase, Ranjitsinhji said of Grace: &quot;he turned the old one-stringed instrument [the cricket bat] into a many-chorded lyre&quot;.

Ranjitsinhji summarised Grace&#x27;s importance to the development of cricket by writing: &quot;I hold him to be not only the finest player born or unborn, but the maker of modern batting (of which) the theory is in all essentials the result of WG&#x27;s thinking and working on the game&quot;. Cricket writer and broadcaster John Arlott, writing in 1975, supported this view by holding that Grace &quot;created modern cricket&quot;.

But Grace&#x27;s extraordinary skill had already been recognised very early in his career, especially by the professional bowlers, as when Tom Emmett called him a &quot;nonsuch&quot; in 1869. Altham pointed out that for most of Grace&#x27;s career, he played on pitches that &quot;the modern schoolboy would consider unfit for a house match&quot; and on grounds without boundaries where every hit including those &quot;into the country&quot; had to be run in full. Rowland Bowen recorded that 1895, the year of Grace&#x27;s &quot;Indian Summer&quot;, was the season in which marl was first used as a binding agent in the composition of English pitches, its benefit being to ensure &quot;good lasting wickets&quot;.

It was through Alfred Pocock&#x27;s perseverance that Grace had learned to play straight and to develop a sound defence so that he would stop or leave the good deliveries and score off the poor ones. This contrasted him with EM who was &quot;always a hitter&quot; and whose basic defence was not as sound. However, as Grace&#x27;s skills developed, he became a very powerful hitter himself with a full range of shots and, at his best, would score runs freely. Despite being an all-rounder, he was also an opening batsman.

===Bowling===
As a bowler, Grace belonged to what Altham calls the &quot;high, home and easy school of a much earlier day&quot;. Using a roundarm action, Grace was adept at varying both his pace and the arc of his slower deliveries which worked in from the leg side of the pitch. The chief feature of his bowling was the excellent length which he consistently maintained. He originally bowled at a consistently fast medium pace but in the 1870s he increasingly adopted his slower style which utilised a leg break. He called this a &quot;leg-tweeker&quot; but he put very little break on the ball, just enough to bring it across from the batsman&#x27;s legs to the wicket and he invariably posted a fielder in a strategic position on the square leg boundary, a trap which brought occasional success. He was unusual in persisting with a roundarm action throughout his career, while almost all other bowlers adopted the newly-legalised overarm style.

===Fielding===
Grace in his prime was noted for his outstanding fielding and was a very strong thrower of the ball, as he demonstrated when he threw one for 122 yards during his athletics career. He attributed this skill to his country-bred childhood in which stone throwing at crows was a daily exercise. In later life, Grace commented upon a decline in English fielding standards and blamed it on &quot;the falling numbers of country-bred boys who strengthen their arms by throwing stones at birds in the fields&quot;.

Grace&#x27;s &quot;Wisden&quot; obituary said that much of his success as a bowler was the result of his magnificent fielding to his own bowling; as soon as he had delivered the ball he covered so much ground to the left that he made himself into an extra mid-off and he took some extraordinary catches in this way. In his early career, Grace generally fielded at long-leg or cover-point; later he was usually at point (see Fielding positions in cricket). In his prime, he was a fine thrower, a fast runner and a safe catcher.

==Legacy and tributes==

MCC decided to commemorate Grace&#x27;s life and career with a &quot;Memorial Biography&quot;, published in 1919. Its preface begins with this passage:

Never was such a band of cricketers gathered for any tour as has assembled to do honour to the greatest of all players in the present Memorial Biography. That such a volume should go forth under the auspices of the Committee of MCC is in itself unique in the history of the game, and that such an array of cricketers, critics and enthusiasts should pay tribute to its finest exponent has no parallel in any other branch of sport. In itself this presents a noble monument of what W. G. Grace was, a testimony to his prowess and to his personality.

The W. G. Grace Memorial Gates were erected at the St John&#x27;s Wood Road entrance to Lord&#x27;s. They were designed by Sir Herbert Baker and the opening ceremony in 1923 was performed by Sir Stanley Jackson, who had suggested the inclusion of the words &quot;The Great Cricketer&quot; in the dedication. On 12 September 2009, Grace was posthumously inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame at Lord&#x27;s—two of his direct descendants attended the ceremony.

British commemorative postage stamps issued on 16 May 1973 for the County Cricket Centenary featured three sketches of Grace by Harry Furniss. The values were threepence (then first-class post); seven pence halfpenny; and ninepence. Grace&#x27;s fame has endured and his large beard in particular remains familiar. For example, &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; (1975) used his image as the &quot;face of God&quot;.

Many of the tributes paid to Grace referred to him as &quot;The Great Cricketer&quot;. Harry Altham, for one, described him as &quot;the greatest of all cricketers&quot;. John Arlott summarised him as &quot;timeless&quot; and &quot;the greatest (cricketer) of them all&quot;. The anti-establishment writer C. L. R. James, in his &quot;Beyond a Boundary&quot;, included a section &quot;W. G.: Pre-Eminent Victorian&quot;, containing four chapters and covering some sixty pages. He declared Grace &quot;the best-known Englishman of his time&quot; and aligned him with Thomas Arnold and Thomas Hughes as &quot;the three most eminent Victorians&quot;. James wrote of cricket as &quot;the game he (Grace) transformed into a national institution&quot;. Simon Rae also commented upon Grace&#x27;s eminence in Victorian England by saying that his public recognition was equalled by only Queen Victoria herself and William Ewart Gladstone.

The inaugural edition of &quot;Playfair Cricket Annual&quot; in 1948 coincided with the centenary of Grace&#x27;s birth and carried a tribute which spoke of Grace as &quot;King in his own domain&quot; and his &quot;Olympian personality&quot;. &quot;Playfair&quot; went on to say how Grace had &quot;pulverised fast bowling on chancy pitches&quot; and had then &quot;astonished the world&quot; by his deeds during his 1895 &quot;Indian Summer&quot;. In the foreword of the same edition, C. B. Fry insisted that Grace would not have started the 1948 season with any notion of being beaten by that season&#x27;s Australian touring team, for he was &quot;sanguine&quot; and would have put everything he could muster into the task of beating them with no acceptance of defeat &quot;till after it happened&quot;. As mentioned in &quot;Playfair&quot;, both MCC and Gloucestershire arranged special matches on Grace&#x27;s birthday to commemorate his centenary.

For the 1963 edition of &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot;, Grace was selected by Neville Cardus as one of the Six Giants of the Wisden Century. This was a special commemorative selection requested by &quot;Wisden&quot; for its 100th edition. The other five players chosen were Sydney Barnes, Don Bradman, Jack Hobbs, Tom Richardson and Victor Trumper. To mark 150 years of the &quot;Almanack&quot;, Wisden named him in an all-time Test World XI.

Derek Birley, who devoted whole passages of his book to criticism of Grace&#x27;s gamesmanship and moneymaking, wrote that the &quot;bleakness (of the war) was exemplified in November (&quot;sic&quot;) 1915 by the death of Grace, which seemed depressingly emblematic of the end of an era&quot;. Rowland Bowen wrote that &quot;many of Grace&#x27;s achievements would be rated extremely good by our standards&quot; but &quot;by the standards of his day they were &quot;phenomenal&quot;: nothing like them had ever been done before&quot;.

David Frith summed up Grace&#x27;s legacy to cricket by writing that &quot;his influence lasted long after his final appearance in first-class cricket in 1908 and his death in 1915&quot;. &quot;For decades&quot;, wrote Frith, &quot;Grace had been arguably the most famous man in England&quot;, easily recognisable because of &quot;his beard and his bulk&quot;, and revered because of &quot;his batsmanship&quot;. Frith added a view that even though Grace&#x27;s records had been overtaken, &quot;his pre-eminence&quot; had not, and so Grace &quot;remains the most famous cricketer of them all, the one who elevated the game in public esteem&quot;.

<text>The United Nations World Tourism Organization or UN Tourism (formerly UNWTO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations which promotes responsible, sustainable and universally-accessible tourism. Its headquarters are in Madrid, Spain. Other offices include: a Regional Support Office for Asia and the Pacific in Nara, Japan and a Regional Office for the Middle East in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

UN Tourism serves as a global forum for tourism policy and a source of tourism research and knowledge. It encourages tourism competitiveness, innovation, education, investments and digital transformation. The organization also focusses on ethics, culture and social responsibility related to tourism, provides technical cooperation and includes a UN Tourism Academy and statistics work.

The six official languages of UN Tourism are Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish.

Before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, tourism stood at an all-time high: 1 out of 10 jobs worldwide depended on tourism and international tourist arrivals reached 1.5 billion in 2019. Against a backdrop of heightened uncertainty, UN Tourism conveyed the Global Tourism Crisis Committee to guide the tourism sector as it faced up to the COVID-19 challenge.

From its inception in 1975 until 2023, UN Tourism was called the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO).

== Members ==
UN Tourism has 160 Member States, six associate members (Aruba, Flanders, Hong Kong, Macao, Madeira and Puerto Rico), and two observers (Holy See (1979), Palestine (1999)). 

Nonmembers are: Australia, Belgium, Belize, Canada, Denmark, Dominica, Estonia, Finland, Grenada, Guyana, Iceland, Ireland, Kiribati, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Sudan, Suriname, Sweden, Tonga, Tuvalu, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Seventeen state members have withdrawn from the organization for different periods in the past including Australia (citing poor value for money), Bahamas (later rejoined), Bahrain (rejoined in 2001), Belgium, Canada (Canada withdrew from the World Tourism Organization when it appointed Robert Mugabe as a leader in 2013), Costa Rica (rejoined in 1995), El Salvador (rejoined in 1993), Grenada, Honduras (rejoined in 2001), Kuwait (rejoined in 2003), Latvia, Malaysia (rejoined in 1991), Myanmar (rejoined in 2012), Panama (rejoined in 1996), Philippines (rejoined in 1991), Qatar (rejoined in 2002), Thailand (rejoined in 1996), United Kingdom and Puerto Rico (as an associate member). The Netherlands Antilles was an associate member before its dissolution.

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) rejoined the organization in May 2013, 26 years after having left UN Tourism.

Additionally, UN Tourism has over 500 affiliate members, including non-governmental entities with specialised interests in tourism, and commercial and non-commercial bodies and associations with activities related to the aims of UN Tourism or falling within its competence.

On 2 April 2022, Russia announced it would leave UN Tourism, and the organization subsequently voted the same day to suspend Russia in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==Secretaries-General==
As host country of UN Tourism&#x27;s headquarters, Spain has a permanent seat on the Executive Council. Representatives of the associate members and affiliate members participate in Executive Council meetings as observers.

==Publications==
* World Tourism Barometer (quarterly)
* International Tourism Highlights (annual)
* UNWTO Annual Report
* UNWTO Declarations
* Knowledge Network Issues Paper Series

==Tourism Data Dashboard==
UN Tourism releases its Tourism Data Dashboard which &quot;provides statistics and insights on key indicators for inbound and outbound tourism at the global, regional and national levels. Data covers tourist arrivals, tourism share of exports and contribution to GDP, source markets, seasonality and accommodation (data on number of rooms, guest and nights).&quot;

===Visa Openness Report===

UN Tourism research concluded that, by improving visa processes and entry formalities, G20 economies could boost their international tourist numbers by 122 million, tourism exports by US$2016 billion and employment by 5 million.

The Organization&#x27;s latest UN Tourism Visa Openness Report, published in 2016, shows the highest ever percentage of international tourists not requiring a visa to travel - 39% compared with 23% in 2008. The report concluded that the 30 countries whose citizens were least affected by visa restrictions in 2015 were (based on the data compiled by the UN Tourism, based on information from national official institutions):

<doc id="34122" wikidata="Q297206" url="?curid=34122" title="Wacław Sierpiński">
<text>Wacław Franciszek Sierpiński (; 14 March 1882 – 21 October 1969) was a Polish mathematician. He was known for contributions to set theory (research on the axiom of choice and the continuum hypothesis), number theory, theory of functions, and topology. He published over 700 papers and 50 books.

Three well-known fractals are named after him (the Sierpiński triangle, the Sierpiński carpet, and the Sierpiński curve), as are Sierpiński numbers and the associated Sierpiński problem.

==Early life and education==

Sierpiński was born in 1882 in Warsaw, Congress Poland, to a doctor father Konstanty and mother Ludwika (&quot;née&quot; Łapińska). His abilities in mathematics were evident from childhood. He enrolled in the Department of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Warsaw in 1899 and graduated five years later. 

In 1903, while still at the University of Warsaw, the Department of Mathematics and Physics offered a prize for the best essay from a student on Voronoy&#x27;s contribution to number theory. Sierpiński was awarded a gold medal for his essay, thus laying the foundation for his first major mathematical contribution. Unwilling for his work to be published in Russian, he withheld it until 1907, when it was published in Samuel Dickstein&#x27;s mathematical magazine &#x27;Prace Matematyczno-Fizyczne&#x27; (Polish: &#x27;The Works of Mathematics and Physics&#x27;).

After his graduation in 1904, Sierpiński worked as a school teacher of mathematics and physics in Warsaw. However, when the school closed because of a strike, Sierpiński decided to go to Kraków to pursue a doctorate. At the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, he attended lectures by Stanisław Zaremba on mathematics. He also studied astronomy and philosophy. In 1906, he received his doctorate and in 1908 was appointed to the University of Lwów. In 1910, he became head of the Faculty of Mathematics at the university.

==Career==
In 1907 Sierpiński first became interested in set theory when he came across a theorem which stated that points in the plane could be specified with a single coordinate. He wrote to Tadeusz Banachiewicz (then at Göttingen), asking how such a result was possible. He received the one-word reply &#x27;Cantor&#x27;. Sierpiński began to study set theory and, in 1909, he gave the first ever lecture course devoted entirely to the subject.

Sierpiński maintained an output of research papers and books. During the years 1908 to 1914, when he taught at the University of Lwów, he published three books in addition to many research papers. These books were &quot;The Theory of Irrational Numbers&quot; (1910), &quot;Outline of Set Theory&quot; (1912), and &quot;The Theory of Numbers&quot; (1912).

When World War I began in 1914, Sierpiński and his family were in Russia. To avoid the persecution that was common for Polish foreigners, Sierpiński spent the rest of the war years in Moscow working with Nikolai Luzin. Together they began the study of analytic sets. In 1916, Sierpiński gave the first example of an absolutely normal number.

When World War I ended in 1918, Sierpiński returned to Lwów. However shortly after taking up his appointment again in Lwów he was offered a post at the University of Warsaw, which he accepted. In 1919 he was promoted to a professor. He spent the rest of his life in Warsaw.

During the Polish–Soviet War (1919–1921), Sierpiński helped break Soviet Russian ciphers for the Polish General Staff&#x27;s cryptologic agency.

In 1920, Sierpiński, together with Zygmunt Janiszewski and his former student Stefan Mazurkiewicz, founded the mathematical journal &quot;Fundamenta Mathematicae&quot;. Sierpiński edited the journal, which specialized in papers on set theory.

During this period, Sierpiński worked predominantly on set theory, but also on point set topology and functions of a real variable. In set theory he made contributions on the axiom of choice and on the continuum hypothesis. He proved that Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory together with the Generalized continuum hypothesis imply the Axiom of choice. He also worked on what is now known as the Sierpiński curve. Sierpiński continued to collaborate with Luzin on investigations of analytic and projective sets. His work on functions of a real variable includes results on functional series, differentiability of functions and Baire&#x27;s classification.

Sierpiński worked at the State Institute of Mathematics, which was incorporated into the Polish Academy of Sciences in 1952. He retired in 1960 as professor at the University of Warsaw, but continued until 1967 to give a seminar on the Theory of Numbers at the Polish Academy of Sciences. He also continued editorial work as editor-in-chief of &quot;Acta Arithmetica&quot;, and as a member of the editorial board of &quot;Rendiconti del Circolo Matematico di Palermo&quot;, &quot;Composito Matematica&quot;, and &quot;Zentralblatt für Mathematik&quot;.

In 1964 he was one of the signatories of the so-called Letter of 34 to Prime Minister Józef Cyrankiewicz regarding freedom of culture.

Sierpiński is interred at the Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw, Poland.

==Honors received==
Honorary Degrees: Lwów (1929), St. Marks of Lima (1930), Tartu (1932), Amsterdam (1932), Sofia (1939), Paris (1939), Bordeaux (1947), Prague (1948), Wrocław (1948), Lucknow (1949), and Moscow (1967).

For high involvement with the development of mathematics in Poland, Sierpiński was honored with election to the Polish Academy of Learning in 1921 and that same year was made dean of the faculty at the University of Warsaw. In 1928, he became vice-chairman of the Warsaw Scientific Society, and that same year was elected chairman of the Polish Mathematical Society.

He was elected to the Geographic Society of Lima (1931), Royal Scientific Society of Liège (1934), Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (1936), National Academy of Lima (1939), Royal Society of Sciences of Naples (1939), Accademia dei Lincei of Rome (1947), Germany Academy of Sciences (1950), American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1959), Paris Academy (1960), Royal Dutch Academy (1961), Academy of Science of Brussels (1961), London Mathematical Society (1964), Romanian Academy (1965) and Papal Academy of Sciences (1967).

In 1946, he received the Stefan Banach Prize of the Polish Mathematical Society. In 1949, Sierpiński was awarded Poland&#x27;s Scientific Prize, first degree.

In 2014, a sculpture in the form of a tree inspired by a fractal created by Sierpiński was unveiled at the Wallenberg Square in Stockholm as part of an exhibition organized by the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 10th anniversary of Poland joining the European Union and 15th anniversary of Poland joining NATO.

== Publications ==
Sierpiński authored 724 papers and 50 books, almost all in Polish. His book &quot;Cardinal and Ordinal Numbers&quot; was originally published in English in 1958. Two books, &quot;Introduction to General Topology&quot; (1934) and &quot;General Topology&quot; (1952) were translated into English by Canadian mathematician Cecilia Krieger.
Another book, &quot;Pythagorean Triangles&quot; (1954), was translated into English by Indian mathematician Ambikeshwar Sharma, published in 1962, and republished by Dover Books in 2003; it also has a Russian translation. Another work of his published in English is the &quot;Elementary Theory of Numbers&quot; (translated by A. Hulanicki in 1964), based on his Polish &quot;Teoria Liczb&quot; (1914 and 1959). Another book, named &quot;250 Problems in Elementary Number Theory&quot; was translated into English (1970) and Russian (1968).

<doc id="34126" wikidata="Q44183" url="?curid=34126" title="William Golding">
<text>Sir William Gerald Golding (19 September 1911 – 19 June 1993) was a British novelist, playwright, and poet. Best known for his debut novel &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; (1954), he published another twelve volumes of fiction in his lifetime. In 1980, he was awarded the Booker Prize for &quot;Rites of Passage&quot;, the first novel in what became his sea trilogy, &quot;To the Ends of the Earth&quot;. He was awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize in Literature.

As a result of his contributions to literature, Golding was knighted in 1988. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. In 2008, &quot;The Times&quot; ranked Golding third on its list of &quot;The 50 greatest British writers since 1945&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Son of Alec Golding, a science master at Marlborough Grammar School (1905 to retirement), and Mildred, née Curnoe, William Golding was born at his maternal grandmother&#x27;s house, 47 Mount Wise, Newquay, Cornwall. The house was known as &quot;Karenza&quot;, the Cornish word for love, and he spent many childhood holidays there. The Golding family lived at 29, The Green, Marlborough, Wiltshire, Golding and his elder brother Joseph attending the school at which their father taught. Golding&#x27;s mother was a campaigner for female suffrage; she was Cornish and was considered by her son &quot;a superstitious Celt&quot;, who used to tell him old Cornish ghost stories from her own childhood. In 1930, Golding went to Brasenose College, Oxford, where he read Natural Sciences for two years before transferring to English for his final two years. His original tutor was the chemist Thomas Taylor. In a private journal and in a memoir for his wife he admitted having tried to rape a teenage girl (with whom he had previously taken piano lessons) during a vacation, having apparently misinterpreted what he had perceived as her having &quot;wanted heavy sex&quot;.

Golding took his B.A. degree with Second Class Honours in the summer of 1934, and later that year a book of his &quot;Poems&quot; was published by Macmillan &amp; Co, with the help of his Oxford friend, the anthroposophist Adam Bittleston.

In 1935, he took a job teaching English at Michael Hall School, a Steiner-Waldorf school then in 
Streatham, South London, staying there for two years. After a year in Oxford studying for a Diploma of Education, he was a schoolmaster teaching English and music at Maidstone Grammar School 1938 – 1940, before moving to Bishop Wordsworth&#x27;s School, Salisbury, in April 1940. There he taught English, Philosophy, Greek, and drama until joining the navy on 18 December 1940, reporting for duty at HMS Raleigh. He returned in 1945 and taught the same subjects until 1961.

Golding kept a personal journal for over 22 years from 1971 until the night before his death, it contained approximately 2.4 million words in total. The journal was initially used by Golding to record his dreams, but over time it began to function as a record of his life. The journals contained insights including retrospective thoughts about his novels and memories from his past. At one point Golding described setting his students up into two groups to fight each other – an experience he drew on when writing &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;. John Carey, the emeritus professor of English literature at Oxford University, was eventually given &#x27;unprecedented access to Golding&#x27;s unpublished papers and journals by the Golding estate&#x27;. Though Golding had not written the journals specifically so that a biography could be written about him, Carey published &quot;William Golding: The Man Who Wrote Lord of the Flies&quot; in 2009.

===Marriage and family===
Golding was engaged to Molly Evans, a woman from Marlborough, who was well liked by both of his parents. However, he broke off the engagement and married Ann Brookfield, an analytical chemist, on 30 September 1939. They had two children, David (born September 1940) and Judith (born July 1945).

===War service===
During World War II, Golding joined the Royal Navy in 1940. He served on a destroyer which was briefly involved in the pursuit and sinking of the German battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot;. Golding participated in the invasion of Normandy on D-Day, commanding a landing craft that fired salvoes of rockets onto the beaches. He was also in action at Walcheren in October and November 1944, during which time 10 out of 27 assault craft that went into the attack were sunk. Golding rose to the rank of lieutenant.

===&quot;Crisis&quot;===
Golding had a troubled relationship with alcohol; Judy Carver notes that her father was &quot;always very open, if rueful, about problems with drink&quot;. Golding suggested that his self-described &quot;crisis&quot;, of which alcoholism played a major part, had plagued him his entire life. John Carey mentions several instances of binge drinking in his biography, including Golding&#x27;s experiences in 1963; whilst on holiday in Greece (when he was meant to have been finishing his novel &quot;The Spire&quot;), after working on his writing in the morning, he would go to his preferred &quot;Kapheneion&quot; to drink at midday. By the evening he would move on to ouzo and brandy; he developed a reputation locally for &quot;provoking explosions&quot;.

Unfortunately, the eventual publication of &quot;The Spire&quot; the following year did not help Golding&#x27;s developing struggle with alcohol; it had precisely the opposite effect, with the novel&#x27;s scathingly negative reviews in a BBC radio broadcast affecting him severely. Following the publication of &quot;The Pyramid&quot; in 1967, Golding experienced a severe writer&#x27;s block: the result of myriad crises (family anxieties, insomnia, and a general sense of dejection). Golding eventually became unable to deal with what he perceived to be the intense reality of his life without first drinking copious amounts of alcohol. Tim Kendall suggests that these experiences manifest in Golding&#x27;s writing as the character Wilf in &quot;The Paper Men&quot;; &quot;an ageing novelist whose alcohol-sodden journeys across Europe are bankrolled by the continuing success of his first book&quot;.

By the late 1960s, Golding was relying on alcohol – which he referred to as &quot;the old, old anodyne&quot;. His first steps towards recovery came from his study of Carl Jung&#x27;s writings, and in what he called &quot;an admission of discipleship&quot;. He travelled to Switzerland in 1971 to see Jung&#x27;s landscapes for himself. That same year, he started keeping a journal in which he recorded and interpreted his dreams; the last entry is from the day before he died, in 1993, and the volumes-long work came to be thousands of pages long by this time.

The crisis did inevitably affect Golding&#x27;s output, and his next novel, &quot;Darkness Visible&quot;, would be published twelve years after &quot;The Pyramid&quot;; a far cry from the prolific author who had produced six novels in thirteen years since the start of his career. Despite this, the extent of Golding&#x27;s recovery is evident from the fact that this was only the first of six further novels that Golding completed before his death.

===Death===
In 1985, Golding and his wife moved to a house called Tullimaar in Perranarworthal, near Truro, Cornwall. He died of heart failure eight years later on 19 June 1993. His body was buried in the parish churchyard of Bowerchalke near his former home and the Wiltshire county border with Hampshire and Dorset.

On his death he left the draft of a novel, &quot;The Double Tongue&quot;, set in ancient Delphi, which was published posthumously in 1995.

==Career==

===Writing success===

In &quot;William Golding: A Critical Study&quot; (2008), George states that, “Golding experienced two things that he counts the greatest influences on his writing—first, the war and his service in the navy and second, his learning ancient Greek.” While still a teacher at Bishop Wordsworth&#x27;s School, in 1951 Golding began writing a manuscript of the novel initially titled &quot;Strangers from Within&quot;. 

In September 1953, after rejections from seven other publishers, Golding sent a manuscript to Faber and Faber and was initially rejected by their reader, Jan Perkins, who labelled it as &quot;Rubbish &amp; dull. Pointless&quot;. His book, however, was championed by Charles Monteith, a new editor at the firm. Monteith asked for some changes to the text and the novel was published in September 1954 as &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;.

After moving in 1958 from Salisbury to nearby Bowerchalke, he met his fellow villager and walking companion James Lovelock. The two discussed Lovelock&#x27;s hypothesis, that the living matter of the planet Earth functions like a single organism, and Golding suggested naming this hypothesis after Gaia, the personification of the Earth in Greek mythology, and mother of the Titans. His publishing success made it possible for Golding to resign his teaching post at Bishop Wordsworth&#x27;s School in 1961, and he spent that academic year in the United States as writer-in-residence at Hollins College (now Hollins University), near Roanoke, Virginia.

Golding won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for &quot;Darkness Visible&quot; in 1979, and the Booker Prize for &quot;Rites of Passage&quot; in 1980. In 1983, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, and was, according to the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, &quot;an unexpected and even contentious choice&quot;.

Having been appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1966 New Year Honours, Golding was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 1988 Birthday Honours. In September 1993, only a few months after his unexpected death, the First International William Golding Conference was held in France.

===Fiction===
His first novel, &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; (1954; film, 1963 and 1990; play, adapted by Nigel Williams, 1995), describes a group of boys stranded on a tropical island descending into a lawless and increasingly wild existence before being rescued. &quot;The Inheritors&quot; (1955) depicts a tribe of gentle Neanderthals encountering modern humans, who by comparison are deceitful and violent. His 1956 novel &quot;Pincher Martin&quot; records the thoughts of a drowning sailor. &quot;Free Fall&quot; (1959) explores the question of freedom of choice. The novel&#x27;s narrator, a World War Two soldier in a German POW Camp, endures interrogation and solitary confinement. After these events and while recollecting the experiences, he looks back over the choices he has made, trying to trace precisely where he lost the freedom to make his own decisions. &quot;The Spire&quot; (1964) follows the construction (and near collapse) of an impossibly large spire on the top of a medieval cathedral (generally assumed to be Salisbury Cathedral). 

Golding&#x27;s 1967 novel, &quot;The Pyramid&quot;, consists of three linked stories with a shared setting in a small English town based partly on Marlborough where Golding grew up. &quot;The Scorpion God&quot; (1971) contains three novellas, the first set in an ancient Egyptian court (&quot;The Scorpion God&quot;); the second describing a prehistoric African hunter-gatherer group (&quot;Clonk, Clonk&quot;); and the third in the court of a Roman emperor (&quot;Envoy Extraordinary&quot;). The last of these, originally published in 1956, was reworked by Golding into a play, &quot;The Brass Butterfly&quot;, in 1958. From 1971 to 1979, Golding published no novels. After this period he published &quot;Darkness Visible&quot; (1979): a story involving terrorism, paedophilia, and a mysterious figure who survives a fire in the Blitz and appears to have supernatural powers. In 1980, Golding published &quot;Rites of Passage&quot;, the first of his novels about a voyage to Australia in the early nineteenth century. The novel won the Booker Prize in 1980 and Golding followed this success with &quot;Close Quarters&quot; (1987) and &quot;Fire Down Below&quot; (1989) to complete his &#x27;sea trilogy&#x27;, later published as one volume entitled &quot;To the Ends of the Earth&quot;. In 1984, he published &quot;The Paper Men&quot;: an account of the struggles between a novelist and his would-be biographer.

<doc id="34127" wikidata="Q740623" url="?curid=34127" title="White Zombie (band)">
<text>White Zombie was an American heavy metal band that formed in 1985. Based in New York City, they started as a noise rock band, releasing three EPs and one studio album in that style before changing to a heavy metal-oriented sound that broke them into the mainstream. The albums &quot;La Sexorcisto: Devil Music Volume One&quot; (1992) and &quot;Astro-Creep: 2000&quot; (1995) established them as an influential act in groove metal and industrial metal, respectively. Their best-known songs include &quot;Thunder Kiss &#x27;65&quot;, &quot;Black Sunshine&quot; and &quot;More Human than Human&quot;. The group officially disbanded in 1998. In 2000, White Zombie was included on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock, ranking at No. 56. As of October 2010, the band has sold six million albums, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

==History==
===Early career, name, and independent releases (1985–1986)===
White Zombie was co-founded by Rob Zombie, after coming up with the band idea in 1985 while attending Parsons School of Design in his junior year. Zombie named the band after a 1932 horror movie starring Bela Lugosi called &quot;White Zombie&quot;, considered the first true zombie movie (the movie title was also the source for Rob Zombie&#x27;s stage name, as he was born Robert Cummings).

Zombie&#x27;s girlfriend at the time, Sean Yseult, was the other co-founder. She had been playing the Farfisa keyboard in the band Life with Ivan de Prume, but the band soon broke up. Ena Kostabi owned a recording studio, which he would rent out to different bands. When he met Yseult, she asked if he could teach her to play bass. They then recruited Peter Landau to play drums and began to write and record songs. White Zombie&#x27;s first release, &quot;Gods on Voodoo Moon&quot;, was an EP and was recorded on October 18, 1985. It was released under the band&#x27;s label Silent Explosion, where they would release most of their early work. Only 300 copies were pressed, of which only 100 were sold; the band members still retain possession of the remaining 200.

In 1986, Zombie hired Tim Jeffs, his Parsons School of Design roommate, to play guitar to replace Ena Kostabi, and Yseult brought in de Prume from their days in the band LIFE as the replacement for Landau. The band made their live performance debut at CBGB on April 28, 1986, and started touring. White Zombie released their second EP, &quot;Pig Heaven&quot;, that year. The release contained two songs, &quot;Pig Heaven&quot; and &quot;Slaughter the Grey&quot;. The EP was recorded at 6/8 Studios in NoHo in New York City. Other songs that were recorded during the session but never released were titled &quot;Follow Wild&quot;, &quot;Rain Insane&quot;, &quot;Paradise Fireball&quot;, and &quot;Red River Flow&quot;. After touring for a year in the band, Tim Jeffs left and was replaced by Tom Guay, often known as Tom Five. The band released a second pressing of &quot;Pig Heaven&quot; with different cover art, but retained the same recording with Jeffs on guitar. Only 500 copies of each pressing were released on vinyl.

===First two albums (1987–1990)===
In 1987, the band released their third EP, &quot;Psycho-Head Blowout&quot;. Later that year, the band released their first full-length album, &quot;Soul-Crusher&quot;, which was their first release to feature sound clips from movies in the songs, a signature that would continue for the remainder of the band&#x27;s lifespan.

In 1988, the band signed to Caroline Records, permanently discontinuing their own indie label. After completing their first U.S. tour in June 1988, Tom Guay was asked to leave the band. He was replaced by John Ricci in July 1988. Their second album, &quot;Make Them Die Slowly&quot;, was released in March 1989. The album was a musical shift for White Zombie. While their previous releases had been strictly punk-influenced noise rock, &quot;Make Them Die Slowly&quot; has demonstrably more of a heavy metal sound. This is also the first album crediting &quot;Rob Zombie&quot; instead of his previous stage name, &quot;Rob &#x27;Dirt&#x27; Straker&quot;.

Ricci&#x27;s carpal tunnel syndrome severely affected his ability to play guitar, forcing him to leave the band when &quot;Make Them Die Slowly&quot; was finished. Jay &quot;J&quot; Yuenger replaced him before the album&#x27;s release, affecting their future sound. One of the most obvious examples of this direction is the difference between the songs &quot;Disaster Blaster&quot; on &quot;Make Them Die Slowly&quot; and the re-worked version, &quot;Disaster Blaster II&quot;, on the &quot;God of Thunder&quot; EP.

===Major label years, mainstream success, and breakup (1991–1998)===
After searching for a record label and being turned down multiple times, the band turned toward RCA Records. However, Zombie opted for a recording contract with Geffen Records. Michael Alago, a representative of Geffen, became interested after hearing &quot;God of Thunder&quot; and watched one of their shows at Pyramid Club and liked them, mostly for their song &quot;Soul-Crusher&quot;. The band produced a demo with the help of J. G. Thirlwell of Foetus and were signed to Geffen.

On March 17, 1992, White Zombie released &quot;La Sexorcisto: Devil Music Volume One&quot;, the album which launched them into mainstream recognition. The band supported &quot;La Sexorcisto&quot; with a two-and-a-half-year-long tour, which saw them performing with numerous bands such as Pantera, Danzig, Kyuss, Testament, Megadeth, Sepultura, Suicidal Tendencies, Anthrax, Quicksand, Monster Magnet, Nudeswirl, Prong and The Obsessed. During the tour, Ivan de Prume left the band to pursue a successful career as a producer/engineer as well as drummer/percussionist and opened his own studio, Burningsound. He was replaced by Phil Buerstatte. The music videos for the songs &quot;Thunder Kiss &#x27;65&quot;, &quot;Black Sunshine&quot; and &quot;Welcome to Planet Motherfucker/Psychoholic Slag&quot; (censored as &quot;Welcome to Planet M.F.&quot;) went into regular rotation on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;, while each music video was featured on the TV show &quot;Beavis and Butt-head&quot;. This boosted the band&#x27;s popularity, and led to &quot;La Sexorcisto&quot; selling over two-million copies in the U.S. alone. During this period, White Zombie had recorded several songs for movie soundtracks and various artists compilation albums, including &quot;Feed the Gods&quot; for the soundtrack to &quot;Airheads&quot;, &quot;I Am Hell&quot; for the &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Experience&quot; compilation album and a cover version of Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Children of the Grave&quot;, which appears on the tribute album &quot;Nativity in Black&quot;; each of these songs received airplay on active rock radio stations, while a music video &quot;Feed the Gods&quot; was released.

By the time White Zombie entered the studio in late 1994 to begin recording their fourth album, Zombie and Yseult had ended their relationship, and Buerstatte was dismissed from the band, due to artistic differences; he was replaced by former Exodus and Testament drummer John Tempesta. In 1995, &quot;Astro-Creep: 2000&quot; was released, which featured a more industrial sound and included the hit single &quot;More Human than Human&quot;. The album was another success for the band, debuting at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 (White Zombie&#x27;s highest-ever chart position), and within a year after its release, it was certified double platinum by the RIAA. To support &quot;Astro Creep 2000&quot;, the band toured non-stop for approximately fifteen months, playing with a wide variety of acts such as Metallica, Soundgarden, the Ramones, the Melvins, The Reverend Horton Heat, Babes in Toyland, Kyuss, Filter, Everclear, the Toadies, CIV and Pennywise. In the summer of 1996, White Zombie played its final dates, co-headlining a North American tour with Pantera.

Also in 1996, an album of remixes was released under the title &quot;Supersexy Swingin&#x27; Sounds&quot;. After making one last song for the film &quot;Beavis and Butt-head Do America&quot;, titled &quot;Ratfinks, Suicide Tanks and Cannibal Girls&quot;, White Zombie broke up in September 1998.

===After disbanding (1998–present)===
After the breakup of White Zombie, Sean Yseult released her first album with surf rock band The Famous Monsters, having started the band in between Zombie tours. 
She also started playing bass for horror-themed New Orleans–based band, Rock City Morgue, and briefly played bass for The Cramps.

Tempesta continued his musical relationship with Zombie, drumming for him on his first two solo albums, &quot;Hellbilly Deluxe&quot; and &quot;The Sinister Urge&quot;. After leaving the Zombie touring band, Tempesta went on to play for Scum of the Earth. Tempesta has toured with Testament (as shown on Testament&#x27;s DVD, &quot;Live In London&quot;). On February 14, 2006, he was hired as the permanent drummer for The Cult, after a brief stint with Helmet.

J. produced records for Fu Manchu and New York–based Puny Human.

In July 2006, original members Tom Five and de Prume reunited to perform with de Prume&#x27;s band, Healer, a middle eastern infused metal band, for several concerts in Southern California for The Vans Warped Tour. De Prume continues to write and record music with Healer, as well as recording, producing and engineering for special projects in his studio, Burningsound. His drums and percussion work can also be heard on Sony&#x27;s &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; score. In 2009, de Prume began hosting the weekly radio show, &quot;Metalopolis&quot;. His studio guests have included Rob Halford, Dave Mustaine, Max Cavalera, Vinnie Paul and Tom Araya. De Prume is also a member of the band KREEP, and has completed a West Coast tour in spring 2010, and is planning an East Coast tour in fall 2010.

In November 2008, Geffen/UME released &quot;Let Sleeping Corpses Lie&quot;, a boxed set which includes sixty four tracks featuring every White Zombie album and EP (except the remix albums), all remastered. The package also contained nine music videos (including their breakthrough Grammy-nominated hit &quot;Thunder Kiss &#x27;65&quot;), and ten live performances. In an interview to promote the release of &quot;Let Sleeping Corpses Lie&quot;, Zombie made it clear that a reunion with his White Zombie bandmates was unlikely, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t want fans to think it&#x27;s the beginning of anything.&quot;

In December 2010 Yseult released &quot;I&#x27;m in the Band&quot;, a book containing tour diaries and photos as well as detailing her eleven years spent as a member of White Zombie.

Since the breakup of White Zombie, Rob Zombie has shown little interest in reforming the band. In June 2011, in an interview with &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine, he was asked why White Zombie split up, to which he replied: &quot;It had run its course. Success is a big thing that you can never plan for, because it affects everybody differently. I don&#x27;t want to blame myself or anyone else in the band — it&#x27;s just that the band didn&#x27;t work anymore. Rather than continuing on and making shitty records and having it all fall apart, I thought: &#x27;Let&#x27;s just end it on a high point.&#x27;&quot; Zombie also stated earlier in 2011 that a White Zombie reunion would never happen and he had not been in contact with any members of the band &quot;except John Tempesta in about 15 years.&quot; In 2018, Yseult mirrored his comments, saying that, in regards to the breakup, &quot;[she] was definitely ready for [the band] to be over with&quot;, and that she stayed in touch with most other band members aside from Zombie.

In May 2013, former drummer Phil Buerstatte died. Shortly after his death, he was impersonated by con-artist Loren Dean Breckenridge III. Breckenridge was previously accused of defrauding rehab centers across the nation, and repeatedly impersonating character actor Loren Dean.

In a November 2015 interview with Artisan News, Yseult stated that a White Zombie vinyl box set was due for release in 2016. On February 16, 2016, &quot;It Came from N.Y.C.&quot; was confirmed for a June 3 release via the Numero Group. The vinyl box set contains remastered versions of all the pre-Geffen Records material (including unreleased tracks) on 5 LPs/3 CDs, a 108-page colored booklet complete with liner notes and rare photos, a discography, and a shirtography.

On May 18, 2016, Riot Fest released their lineups and it was revealed that Rob Zombie would be performing &quot;Astro-Creep: 2000&quot; in its entirety at the Chicago weekend. This sparked a swirl of speculation, coupled with the recently reunited Misfits, that a White Zombie reunion would also be occurring at the festival. When asked in September 2016 about his refusal to reform White Zombie, Rob replied, &quot;[I am] always amazed at how people can speak with such authority on subjects they know zero about. I have many legit reasons. Just because you don&#x27;t know them does not mean they don&#x27;t exist. Everything is not everybody&#x27;s business.&quot; Guitarist J. said, however, that he and bassist Sean Yseult could do an &quot;&quot;Astro Creep&quot;, &#x27;more original members&#x27; tour&quot;, and added that they &quot;joke about it sometimes&quot;. On May 22, 2017, Rob posted a short snippet of audio, to his Instagram account, of a live recording of the White Zombie song &quot;Electric Head Part 2&quot;, with a comment stating he was in the process of mixing the &quot;Astro Creep 2000&quot; live set from the Chicago date of the 2016 Riot Fest.

==Musical style==

White Zombie initially emerged from New York City&#x27;s noise rock scene. They were considered a New York Underground band. The introduction of Jay Noel Yuenger into the band, according to &quot;AllMusic&#x27;s&quot; Greg Prato, &quot;helped toughen up the band&#x27;s sound even further -- inching closer to a heavy metal band more than ever before&quot;. White Zombie changed their style from noise rock to a groove metal sound, and would come to be associated with the alternative metal scene of the 1990s. Rob Zombie was also introducing elements of industrial rock into the band&#x27;s sound, making White Zombie &quot;one of the few hard rock bands of the era that you could also dance to.&quot; The &quot;LA Weekly&quot; placed White Zombie within the nu metal scene and said that the band&#x27;s &quot;whirling rhythms driving dance-rock ragers&quot; helped the band stand out. &quot;MTV&quot; described the band as &quot;horror rock&quot; and a &quot;horror obsessed industrial-metal band&quot;. White Zombie fused &quot;B-horror movie visuals and subject matter with heavy music and growled vocals&quot;, according to &quot;AllMusic&#x27;s&quot; Greg Prato, &quot;AllMusic&#x27;s&quot; Bradley Torreano, reviewing the album &quot;Soul Crusher&quot;, wrote that Rob Zombie&#x27;s &quot;wonderfully phantasmagoric lyrics blend bizarre phrases and unique rhymes&quot;.

<text>Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt (; ; 16 August 1832 – 31 August 1920) was a German physiologist, philosopher, and professor, one of the fathers of modern psychology. Wundt, who distinguished psychology as a science from philosophy and biology, was the first person to call himself a psychologist.

He is widely regarded as the &quot;father of experimental psychology&quot;. In 1879, at the University of Leipzig, Wundt founded the first formal laboratory for psychological research. This marked psychology as an independent field of study.

He also established the first academic journal for psychological research, &quot;Philosophische Studien&quot; (from 1883 to 1903), followed by &quot;Psychologische Studien&quot; (from 1905 to 1917), to publish the institute&#x27;s research.

A survey published in &quot;American Psychologist&quot; in 1991 ranked Wundt&#x27;s reputation as first for &quot;all-time eminence&quot;, based on ratings provided by 29 American historians of psychology. William James and Sigmund Freud were ranked a distant second and third.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Wundt was born at Neckarau, Baden (now part of Mannheim) on 16 August 1832, the fourth child to parents Maximilian Wundt (1787–1846), a Lutheran minister, and Marie Frederike, née Arnold (1797–1868). Two of Wundt&#x27;s siblings died in childhood; his brother, Ludwig, survived. Wundt&#x27;s paternal grandfather was Friedrich Peter Wundt (1742–1805), professor of geography and pastor in Wieblingen. When Wundt was about six years of age, his family moved to Heidelsheim, then a small medieval town in Baden-Württemberg.

Born in the German Confederation at a time that was considered very economically stable, Wundt grew up during a period in which the reinvestment of wealth into educational, medical and technological development was commonplace. An economic striving for the advancement of knowledge catalyzed the development of a new psychological study method, and facilitated his development into the prominent psychological figure he is today.

===Education and Heidelberg career===
Wundt studied from 1851 to 1856 at the University of Tübingen, at the University of Heidelberg, and at the University of Berlin. After graduating as a doctor of medicine from Heidelberg (1856), with doctoral advisor Karl Ewald Hasse, Wundt studied briefly with Johannes Peter Müller, before joining the Heidelberg University&#x27;s staff, becoming an assistant to the physicist and physiologist Hermann von Helmholtz in 1858 with responsibility for teaching the laboratory course in physiology. There he wrote &quot;Contributions to the Theory of Sense Perception&quot; (1858–1862). In 1864, he became associate professor for anthropology and medical psychology and published a textbook about human physiology. However, his main interest, according to his lectures and classes, was not in the medical field – he was more attracted by psychology and related subjects. His lectures on psychology were published as &quot;Lectures on Human and Animal Psychology&quot; in 1863–1864. Wundt applied himself to writing a work that came to be one of the most important in the history of psychology, &quot;Principles of Physiological Psychology&quot;, in 1874. This was the first textbook that was written pertaining to the field of experimental psychology.

===Marriage and family===
In 1867, near Heidelberg, Wundt met Sophie Mau (1844–1912). She was the eldest daughter of the Kiel theology professor and his wife Louise, née von Rumohr, and a sister of the archaeologist August Mau. They married on 14 August 1872 in Kiel. The couple had three children: Eleanor (1876–1957), who became an assistant to her father in many ways, Louise, called Lilli, (1880–1884) and (1879–1963), who became a philosophy professor.

===Career in Zurich and Leipzig===
In 1875, Wundt was promoted to professor of &quot;Inductive Philosophy&quot; in Zurich, and in 1875, Wundt was made professor of philosophy at the University of Leipzig where Ernst Heinrich Weber (1795–1878) and Gustav Theodor Fechner (1801–1887) had initiated research on sensory psychology and psychophysics – and where two centuries earlier Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz had developed his philosophy and theoretical psychology, which strongly influenced Wundt&#x27;s intellectual path. Wundt&#x27;s admiration for Ernst Heinrich Weber was clear from his memoirs, where he proclaimed that Weber should be regarded as the father of experimental psychology: &quot;I would rather call Weber the father of experimental psychology…It was Weber&#x27;s great contribution to think of measuring psychic quantities and of showing the exact relationships between them, to be the first to understand this and carry it out.&quot;

===Laboratory of Experimental Psychology===
In 1879, at the University of Leipzig, Wundt opened the first laboratory ever to be exclusively devoted to psychological studies, and this event marked the official birth of psychology as an independent field of study. The new lab was full of graduate students carrying out research on topics assigned by Wundt, and it soon attracted young scholars from all over the world who were eager to learn about the new science that Wundt had developed.

The University of Leipzig assigned Wundt a lab in 1876 to store equipment he had brought from Zurich. Located in the Konvikt building, many of Wundt&#x27;s demonstrations took place in this laboratory due to the inconvenience of transporting his equipment between the lab and his classroom. Wundt arranged for the construction of suitable instruments and collected many pieces of equipment such as tachistoscopes, chronoscopes, pendulums, electrical devices, timers, and sensory mapping devices, and was known to assign an instrument to various graduate students with the task of developing uses for future research in experimentation. Between 1885 and 1909, there were 15 assistants.

In 1879, Wundt began conducting experiments that were not part of his course work, and he claimed that these independent experiments solidified his lab&#x27;s legitimacy as a formal laboratory of psychology, though the university did not officially recognize the building as part of the campus until 1883. The laboratory grew and encompassed a total of eleven rooms. The Psychological Institute, as it became known, eventually moved to a new building that Wundt had designed specifically for psychological research.

===Wundt&#x27;s teaching in the Institute for Experimental Psychology===
The list of Wundt&#x27;s lectures during the winter terms of 1875–1879 shows a wide-ranging programme, 6 days a week, on average 2 hours daily, e.g. in the winter term of 1875: Psychology of language, Anthropology, Logic and Epistemology; and during the subsequent summer term: Psychology, Brain and Nerves, as well as Physiology. Cosmology, Historical and General Philosophy were included in the following terms.

===Wundt&#x27;s doctoral students===
Wundt was responsible for an extraordinary number of doctoral dissertations between 1875 and 1919: 185 students including 70 foreigners (of whom 23 were from Russia, Poland, and other east-European countries and 18 were from America). Several of Wundt&#x27;s students became eminent psychologists in their own right. They include the Germans Oswald Külpe (a professor at the University of Würzburg), Ernst Meumann (a professor in Leipzig and in Hamburg and a pioneer in pedagogical psychology), Hugo Münsterberg (a professor in Freiburg and at Harvard University, a pioneer in applied psychology), and cultural psychologist Willy Hellpach, and the Armenian Gourgen Edilyan.

The Americans listed include James McKeen Cattell (the first professor of psychology in the United States), Granville Stanley Hall (the father of the child psychology movement and adolescent developmental theorist, head of Clark University), Charles Hubbard Judd (Director of the School of Education at the University of Chicago), Walter Dill Scott (who contributed to the development of industrial psychology and taught at Harvard University), Edward Bradford Titchener, Lightner Witmer (founder of the first psychological clinic in his country), Frank Angell, Edward Wheeler Scripture, James Mark Baldwin (one of the founders of Princeton&#x27;s Department of Psychology and who made important contributions to early psychology, psychiatry, and to the theory of evolution).

Wundt, thus, is present in the academic &quot;family tree&quot; of the majority of American psychologists, first and second generation. – Worth mentioning are the Englishman Charles Spearman; the Romanian Constantin Rădulescu-Motru (Personalist philosopher and head of the Philosophy department at the university of Bucharest), Hugo Eckener, the manager of the Luftschiffbau Zeppelin – not to mention those students who became philosophers (like Rudolf Eisler or the Serbian Ljubomir Nedić). – Students (or visitors) who were later to become well known included Vladimir Mikhailovich Bekhterev (Bechterev), Franz Boas, Émile Durkheim, Edmund Husserl, Bronisław Malinowski, George Herbert Mead, Edward Sapir, Ferdinand Tönnies, Benjamin Lee Whorf.

Much of Wundt&#x27;s work was derided mid-century in the United States because of a lack of adequate translations, misrepresentations by certain students, and behaviorism&#x27;s polemic with Wundt&#x27;s program.

===Retirement and death===
Wundt retired in 1917 to devote himself to his scientific writing. According to Wirth (1920), over the summer of 1920, Wundt &quot;felt his vitality waning ... and soon after his eighty-eighth birthday, he died ... a gentle death on the afternoon of Tuesday, August 3&quot; Wundt is buried in Leipzig&#x27;s South Cemetery with his wife, Sophie, and their daughters, Lilli and Eleanor.

==Awards and Honors==
Wundt was awarded honorary doctorates from the Universities of Leipzig and Göttingen, and the Pour le Mérite for Science and Arts. He was nominated three times for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

Wundt was an honorary member of 12 scientific organizations or societies. He was a corresponding member of 13 academies in Germany and abroad. For example, he was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1895 and of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1909.
Wundt&#x27;s name was given to the Asteroid Vundtia (635).

== Overview of Wundt&#x27;s work ==
Wundt was initially a physician and a well-known neurophysiologist before turning to sensory physiology and psychophysics. He was convinced that, for example, the process of spatial perception could not solely be explained on a physiological level, but also involved psychological principles. Wundt founded experimental psychology as a discipline and became a pioneer of cultural psychology. He created a broad research programme in empirical psychology and developed a system of philosophy and ethics from the basic concepts of his psychology – bringing together several disciplines in one person.

Wundt&#x27;s epistemological position – against John Locke and English empiricism (sensualism) – was made clear in his book &quot;Beiträge zur Theorie der Sinneswahrnehmung&quot; (Contributions on the Theory of Sensory Perception) published in 1862, by his use of a quotation from Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz on the title page:

&quot;Nihil est in intellectu quod non fuerit in sensu, nisi intellectu ipse.&quot; (Leibniz, Nouveaux essais, 1765, Livre II, Des Idées, Chapitre 1, § 6).
– Nothing is in the intellect that was not first in the senses, except the intellect itself.

Principles that are not present in sensory impressions can be recognised in human perception and consciousness: logical inferences, categories of thought, the principle of causality, the principle of purpose (teleology), the principle of emergence and other epistemological principles.

Wundt&#x27;s most important books are:

* &quot;Lehrbuch der Physiologie des Menschen&quot; (Textbook of Human Physiology) (1864/1865, 4th ed. 1878);
* &quot;Grundzüge der physiologischen Psychologie&quot; (Principles of Physiological Psychology), (1874; 6th ed. 1908–1911, 3 Vols.);
* &quot;System der Philosophie&quot; (System of Philosophy), (1889; 4th ed. 1919, 2 Vols.);
* &quot;Logik. Eine Untersuchung der Prinzipien der Erkenntnis und der Methoden wissenschaftlicher Forschung&quot; (Logic. An investigation into the principles of knowledge and the methods of scientific research), (1880–1883; 4th ed. 1919–1921, 3 Vols.);
* &quot;Ethik&quot; (Ethics), (1886; 3rd ed. 1903, 2 Vols.);
* &quot;Völkerpsychologie. Eine Untersuchung der Entwicklungsgesetze von Sprache, Mythos und Sitte&quot; (Cultural Psychology. An investigation into developmental laws of language, myth, and conduct), (1900–1920, 10 Vols.);
* &quot;Grundriss der Psychologie&quot; (Outline of Psychology), (1896; 14th ed. 1920).
These 22 volumes cover an immense variety of topics. On examination of the complete works, however, a close relationship between Wundt&#x27;s theoretical psychology, epistemology and methodology can be seen. English translations are only available for the best-known works: &quot;Principles of physiological Psychology&quot; (only the single-volume 1st ed. of 1874) and &quot;Ethics&quot; (also only 1st ed. of 1886). Wundt&#x27;s work remains largely inaccessible without advanced knowledge of German. Its reception, therefore, is still greatly hampered by misunderstandings, stereotypes and superficial judgements.

== Central themes in Wundt&#x27;s work ==

===Memory===

Wilhelm Wundt conducted experiments on memory, which would be considered today as iconic memory, short-term memory, and enactment and generation effects.

===Process theory===

Psychology is interested in the current process, i.e. the mental changes and functional relationships between perception, cognition, emotion, and volition/ motivation. Mental (psychological) phenomena are changing processes of consciousness. They can only be determined as an actuality, an &quot;immediate reality of an event in the psychological experience&quot;. The relationships of consciousness, i.e. the actively organising processes, are no longer explained metaphysically by means of an immortal &#x27;soul&#x27; or an abstract transcendental (spiritual) principle.

===The delineation of categories===

Wundt considered that reference to the subject (Subjektbezug), value assessment (Wertbestimmung), the existence of purpose (Zwecksetzung), and volitional acts (Willenstätigkeit) to be specific and fundamental categories for psychology. He frequently used the formulation &quot;the human as a motivated and thinking subject&quot; in order to characterise features held in common with the humanities and the categorical difference to the natural sciences.

===Psychophysical parallelism===

Influenced by Leibniz, Wundt introduced the term psychophysical parallelism as follows: &quot;… wherever there are regular relationships between mental and physical phenomena the two are neither identical nor convertible into one another because they are per se incomparable; but they are associated with one another in the way that certain mental processes regularly correspond to certain physical processes or, figuratively expressed, run &#x27;parallel to one another&#x27;.&quot; Although the inner experience is based on the functions of the brain there are no physical causes for mental changes.

Leibniz wrote: &quot;Souls act according to the laws of final causes, through aspirations, ends and means. Bodies act according to the laws of efficient causes, i.e. the laws of motion. And these two realms, that of efficient causes and that of final causes, harmonize with one another.&quot; (Monadology, Paragraph 79).

Wundt follows Leibniz and differentiates between a &quot;physical&quot; causality (natural causality of neurophysiology) and a &quot;mental&quot; (&quot;psychic&quot;) causality of the consciousness process. Both causalities, however, are not opposites in a dualistic metaphysical sense, but depend on the standpoint. Causal explanations in psychology must be content to seek the effects of the antecedent causes without being able to derive exact predictions. Using the example of volitional acts, Wundt describes possible inversion in considering cause and effect, ends and means, and explains how causal and teleological explanations can complement one another to establish a co-ordinated consideration.

Wundt&#x27;s position differed from contemporary authors who also favoured parallelism. Instead of being content with the postulate of parallelism, he developed his principles of &quot;mental causality&quot; in contrast to the natural causality of neurophysiology, and a corresponding methodology. There are two fundamentally different approaches of the postulated psychophysical unit, not just two points-of-view in the sense of Gustav Theodor Fechner&#x27;s identity hypothesis. Psychological and physiological statements exist in two categorically different reference systems; the important categories are to be emphasised in order to prevent category mistakes as discussed by Nicolai Hartmann. In this regard, Wundt created the first genuine epistemology and methodology of empirical psychology (the term philosophy of science did not yet exist).

===Apperception===

Apperception is Wundt&#x27;s central theoretical concept. Leibniz described apperception as the process in which the elementary sensory impressions pass into (self-)consciousness, whereby individual aspirations (striving, volitional acts) play an essential role. Wundt developed psychological concepts, used experimental psychological methods and put forward neuropsychological modelling in the frontal cortex of the brain system – in line with today&#x27;s thinking. Apperception exhibits a range of theoretical assumptions on the integrative process of consciousness. The selective control of attention is an elementary example of such active cognitive, emotional and motivational integration.

===Development theory of the mind===

The fundamental task is to work out a comprehensive development theory of the mind – from animal psychology to the highest cultural achievements in language, religion and ethics. Unlike other thinkers of his time, Wundt had no difficulty connecting the development concepts of the humanities (in the spirit of Friedrich Hegel and Johann Gottfried Herder) with the biological theory of evolution as expounded by Charles Darwin.

===Critical realism===

Wundt determined that &quot;psychology is an empirical science co-ordinating natural science and humanities, and that the considerations of both complement one another in the sense that only together can they create for us a potential empirical knowledge.&quot; He claimed that his views were free of metaphysics and were based on certain epistemological presuppositions, including the differentiation of subject and object in the perception, and the principle of causality. With his term &quot;critical realism&quot;, Wundt distinguishes himself from other philosophical positions.

===Definition of psychology===

Wundt set himself the task of redefining the broad field of psychology between philosophy and physiology, between the humanities and the natural sciences. In place of the metaphysical definition as a science of the soul came the definition, based on scientific theory, of empirical psychology as a psychology of consciousness with its own categories and epistemological principles. Psychology examines the &quot;entire experience in its immediately subjective reality.&quot; The task of psychology is to precisely analyse the processes of consciousness, to assess the complex connections (&quot;psychische Verbindungen&quot;), and to find the laws governing such relationships.

#Psychology is &#x27;not a science of the individual soul . Life is a uniform mental and physical process that can be considered in a variety of ways in order to recognise general principles, particularly the psychological-historical and biological principles of development. Wundt demanded an understanding of the emotional and the volitional functions, in addition to cognitive features, as equally important aspects of the unitary (whole) psychophysical process.
#Psychology cannot be reduced to physiology. The tools of physiology remain fundamentally insufficient for the task of psychology. Such a project is meaningless &quot;because the interrelations between mental processes would be incomprehensible even if the interrelations between brain processes were as clearly understood as the mechanism of a pocket watch.&quot;
#Psychology is concerned with conscious processes. Wundt rejected making subconscious mental processes a topic of scientific psychology for epistemological and methodological reasons. In his day there were, before Sigmund Freud, influential authors such as the philosopher Eduard von Hartmann (1901), who postulated a metaphysics of &quot;the unconscious&quot;. Wundt had two fundamental objections. He rejected all primarily metaphysically founded psychology and he saw no reliable methodological approach. He also soon revised his initial assumptions about unconscious judgements When Wundt rejects the assumption of &quot;the unconscious&quot; he is also showing his scepticism regarding Fechner&#x27;s theory of the unconscious and Wundt is perhaps even more greatly influenced by the flood of writing at the time on hypnotism and spiritualism (Wundt, 1879, 1892). While Freud frequently quoted from Wundt&#x27;s work, Wundt remained sceptical about all hypotheses that operated with the concept of &quot;the unconscious&quot;.For Wundt it would be just as much a misunderstanding to define psychology as a behavioural science in the sense of the later concept of strict behaviourism. Numerous behavioural and psychological variables had already been observed or measured at the Leipzig laboratory. Wundt stressed that physiological effects, for example the physiological changes accompanying feelings, were only tools of psychology, as were the physical measurements of stimulus intensity in psychophysics. Further developing these methodological approaches one-sidedly would ultimately, however, lead to a behavioural physiology, i.e. a scientific reductionism, and not to a general psychology and cultural psychology.
#Psychology is an empirical humanities science. Wundt was convinced of the triple status of psychology:
#* as a science of the direct experience it contrasts with the natural sciences that refer to the indirect content of experience and abstract from the subject;
#* as a science &quot;of generally valid forms of direct human experience it is the foundation of the humanities&quot;;
#* among all the empirical sciences it was &quot;the one whose results most benefit the examination of the general problems of epistemology and ethics – the two fundamental areas of philosophy.&quot;

Wundt&#x27;s concepts were developed during almost 60 years of research and teaching that led him from neurophysiology to psychology and philosophy. The interrelationships between physiology, philosophy, logic, epistemology and ethics are therefore essential for an understanding of Wundt&#x27;s psychology. The core of Wundt&#x27;s areas of interest and guiding ideas can already be seen in his &quot;Vorlesungen über die Menschen- und Tierseele&quot; (Lectures on Human and Animal Psychology) of 1863: &quot;individual psychology&quot; (now known as general psychology, i.e. areas such as perception, attention, apperception, volition, will, feelings and emotions); &quot;cultural psychology&quot; (Wundt&#x27;s Völkerpsychologie) as development theory of the human mind); &quot;animal psychology&quot;; and &quot;neuropsychology&quot;. The initial conceptual outlines of the 30-year-old Wundt (1862, 1863) led to a long research program, to the founding of the first Institute and to the treatment of psychology as a discipline, as well as to a range of fundamental textbooks and numerous other publications.

== Physiology ==

During the Heidelberg years from 1853 to 1873, Wundt published numerous essays on physiology, particularly on experimental neurophysiology, a textbook on human physiology (1865, 4th ed. 1878) and a manual of medical physics (1867). He wrote about 70 reviews of current publications in the fields of neurophysiology and neurology, physiology, anatomy and histology. A second area of work was sensory physiology, including spatial perception, visual perception and optical illusions. 
An optical illusion described by him is called the &quot;Wundt illusion&quot;, a variant of the Hering Illusion. It shows how straight lines appear curved when seen against a set of radiating lines.

== Psychology ==

=== Starting point ===
As a result of his medical training and his work as an assistant to Hermann von Helmholtz, Wundt knew the benchmarks of experimental research, as well as the speculative nature of psychology in the mid-19th century. Wundt&#x27;s aspiration for scientific research and the necessary methodological critique were clear when he wrote of the language of ordinary people, who merely invoked their personal experiences of life, criticized naive introspection, or quoted the influence of uncritical amateur (&quot;folk&quot;) psychology on psychological interpretation. 
His &quot;Beiträge zur Theorie der Sinneswahrnehmung&quot; (1862) shows Wundt&#x27;s transition from a physiologist to an experimental psychologist. &quot;Why does not psychology follow the example of the natural sciences? It is an understanding that, from every side of the history of the natural sciences, informs us that the progress of every science is closely connected with the progress made regarding experimental methods.&quot; With this statement, however, he will in no way treat psychology as a pure natural science, though psychologists should learn from the progress of methods in the natural sciences: &quot;There are two sciences that must come to the aid of general psychology in this regard: the development history of the mind and comparative psychology.&quot;

=== General psychology ===
The &quot;Grundzüge der physiologischen Psychologie&quot; (&quot;Main Features of Physiological Psychology&quot;) on general psychology is Wundt&#x27;s best-known textbook. He wanted to connect two sciences with one another. &quot;Physiology provides information on all phenomena of life that can be perceived using our external senses. In psychology humans examine themselves, as it were, from within and look for the connections between these processes to explain which of them represent this inner observation.&quot;

&quot;With sufficient certainty the approach can indeed be seen as well-founded – that nothing takes place in our consciousness that does not have its physical basis in certain physiological processes.&quot;. Wundt believed that physiological psychology had the following task: &quot;firstly, to investigate those life processes that are centrally located, between external and internal experience, which make it necessary to use both observation methods simultaneously, external and internal, and, secondly, to illuminate and, where possible, determine a total view of human existence from the points of view gained from this investigation.&quot; &quot;The attribute &#x27;physiological&#x27; is not saying that it ... [physiological psychology] ... wants to reduce the psychology to physiology – which I consider impossible – but that it works with physiological, i.e. experimental, tools and, indeed, more so than is usual in other psychology, takes into account the relationship between mental and physical processes.&quot; &quot;If one wants to treat the peculiarities of the method as the most important factor then our science – as experimental psychology – differs from the usual science of the soul purely based on self-observation.&quot; 
After long chapters on the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system, the &quot;Grundzüge&quot; (1874) has five sections: the mental elements, mental structure, interactions of the mental structure, mental developments, the principles and laws of mental causality. Through his insistence that mental processes were analysed in their elements, Wundt did not want to create a pure element psychology because the elements should simultaneously be related to one another. He describes the sensory impression with the simple sensory feelings, perceptions and volitional acts connected with them, and he explains dependencies and feedbacks.

===Apperception theory===
Wundt rejected the widespread association theory, according to which mental connections (learning) are mainly formed through the frequency and intensity of particular processes. His term &quot;apperception psychology&quot; means that he considered the &quot;creative&quot; conscious activity to be more important than elementary association. Apperception is an emergent activity that is both arbitrary and selective as well as imaginative and comparative. In this process, feelings and ideas are images apperceptively connected with typical tones of feeling, selected in a variety of ways, analysed, associated and combined, as well as linked with motor and autonomic functions – not simply &quot;processed&quot; but also &quot;creatively synthesised&quot; (see below on the Principle of creative synthesis). In the integrative process of conscious activity, Wundt sees an elementary activity of the subject, i.e. an act of volition, to deliberately move content into the conscious. Insofar that this emergent activity is typical of all mental processes, it is possible to describe his point-of-view as voluntaristic.

Wundt describes apperceptive processes as psychologically highly differentiated and, in many regards, bases this on methods and results from his experimental research. One example is the wide-ranging series of experiments on the mental chronometry of complex reaction times. In research on feelings, certain effects are provoked while pulse and breathing are recorded using a kymograph. The observed differences were intended to contribute towards supporting Wundt&#x27;s theory of emotions with its three dimensions: pleasant – unpleasant, tense – relaxed, excited – depressed.

=== Cultural psychology ===
Wilhelm Wundt&#x27;s &quot;Völkerpsychologie. Eine Untersuchung der Entwicklungsgesetze von Sprache, Mythus und Sitte&quot; (&quot;Social Psychology. An Investigation of the Laws of Evolution of Language, Myth, and Custom&quot;, 1900–1920, 10 Vols.) which also contains the evolution of Arts, Law, Society, Culture and &quot;History&quot;, is a milestone project, a monument of cultural psychology, of the early 20th century. The dynamics of cultural development were investigated according to psychological and epistemological principles. Psychological principles were derived from Wundt&#x27;s psychology of apperception (theory of higher integrative processes, including association, assimilation, semantic change) and motivation (will), as presented in his &quot;Grundzüge der physiologischen Psychologie&quot; (1908–1910, 6th ed., 3 Vols.). In contrast to individual psychology, cultural psychology aims to illustrate general mental development laws governing higher intellectual processes: the development of thought, language, artistic imagination, myths, religion, customs, the relationship of individuals to society, the intellectual environment and the creation of intellectual works in a society. &quot;Where deliberate experimentation ends is where history has experimented on the behalf of psychologists.&quot; Those mental processes that &quot;underpin the general development of human societies and the creation of joint intellectual results that are of generally recognised value&quot; are to be examined.

Stimulated by the ideas of previous thinkers, such as Johann Gottfried Herder, Johann Friedrich Herbart, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Wilhelm von Humboldt (with his ideas about comparative linguistics), the psychologist Moritz Lazarus (1851) and the linguist Heymann Steinthal founded the &quot;Zeitschrift für Völkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft&quot; (Journal for Cultural Psychology and Linguistics) in 1860, which gave this field its name. Wundt (1888) critically analysed the, in his view, still disorganised intentions of Lazarus and Steinthal and limited the scope of the issues by proposing a psychologically constituted structure. The cultural psychology of language, myth, and customs were to be based on the three main areas of general psychology: imagining and thought, feelings, and will (motivation). The numerous mental interrelations and principles were to be researched under the perspective of cultural development. Apperception theory applied equally for general psychology and cultural psychology. Changes in meanings and motives were examined in many lines of development, and there are detailed interpretations based on the emergence principle (creative synthesis), the principle of unintended side-effects (heterogony of ends) and the principle of contrast (see section on &quot;Methodology and Strategies&quot;).

The ten volumes consist of: Language (Vols. 1 and 2), Art (Vol. 3), Myths and Religion (Vols. 4 – 6), Society (Vols. 7 and 8), Law (Vol. 9), as well as Culture and History (Vol. 10). The methodology of cultural psychology was mainly described later, in &quot;Logik&quot; (1921). Wundt worked on, psychologically linked, and structured an immense amount of material. The topics range from agriculture and trade, crafts and property, through gods, myths and Christianity, marriage and family, peoples and nations to (self-)education and self-awareness, science, the world and humanity.

Wundt recognized about 20 &quot;fundamental dynamic motives in cultural development&quot;. Motives frequently quoted in cultural development are: division of labour, ensoulment, salvation, happiness, production and imitation, child-raising, artistic drive, welfare, arts and magic, adornment, guilt, punishment, atonement, self-education, play, and revenge. Other values and motives emerge in the areas of freedom and justice, war and peace, legal structures, state structures and forms of government; also regarding the development of a world view of culture, religion, state, traffic, and a worldwide political and social society. In religious considerations, many of the values and motives (i.e. belief in soul, immortality, belief in gods and demons, ritualistic acts, witchcraft, animism and totemism) are combined with the motives of art, imagination, dance and ecstasy, as well as with forms of family and power.

Wundt saw examples of human self-education in walking upright, physical facilities and &quot;an interaction in part forced upon people by external conditions and in part the result of voluntary culture&quot;. He described the random appearance and later conscious control of fire as a similar interaction between two motives. In the interaction of human activity and the conditions of nature he saw a creative principle of culture right from the start; tools as cultural products of a second nature. An interactive system of cause and effect, a system of purposes and thus values (and reflexively from standards of one&#x27;s own activities) is formed according to the principles of one&#x27;s own thinking.

In the &quot;Elemente der Völkerpsychologie&quot; (The Elements of Cultural Psychology, 1912) Wundt sketched out four main levels of cultural development: primitive man, the totemistic age, the age of heroes and gods, and the development of humanity. The delineations were unclear and the depiction was greatly simplified. Only this book was translated into English &quot;Elements of folk-psychology&quot;), thus providing but a much abridged insight into Wundt&#x27;s differentiated cultural psychology. (The Folk Psychology part of the title already demonstrates the low level of understanding).

In retrospect, &#x27;Völkerpsychologie&#x27; was an unfortunate choice of title because it is often misinterpreted as ethnology. Wundt also considered calling it (Social) Anthropology, Social Psychology and Community Psychology. The term &quot;Kulturpsychologie&quot; would have been more fitting though &quot;psychological development theory of the mind&quot; would have expressed Wundt&#x27;s intentions even better. The intellectual potential and heuristics of Wundt&#x27;s Cultural Psychology are by no means exhausted.

=== Neuropsychology ===
Wundt contributed to the state of neuropsychology as it existed at the time in three ways: through his criticism of the theory of localisation (then widespread in neurology), through his demand for research hypotheses founded on both neurological and psychological thinking, and through his neuropsychological concept of an apperception centre in the frontal cortex. Wundt considered attention and the control of attention an excellent example of the desirable combination of experimental psychological and neurophysiological research. Wundt called for experimentation to localise the higher central nervous functions to be based on clear, psychologically based research hypotheses because the questions could not be rendered precisely enough on the anatomical and physiological levels alone.
Wundt based his central theory of apperception on neuropsychological modelling (from the 3rd edition of the &quot;Grundzüge&quot; onwards). According to this, the hypothetical apperception centre in the frontal cerebral cortex that he described could interconnect sensory, motor, autonomic, cognitive, emotional and motivational process components Wundt thus provided the guiding principle of a primarily psychologically oriented research programme on the highest integrative processes. He is therefore a forerunner of current research on cognitive and emotional executive functions in the prefrontal cerebral cortex, and on hypothetical &quot;multimodal convergence zones&quot; in the network of cortical and limbic functions. This concept of an interdisciplinary neuroscience is now taken for granted, but Wundt&#x27;s contribution towards this development has almost been forgotten. C.S. Sherrington repeatedly quotes Wundt&#x27;s research on the physiology of the reflexes in his textbook, but not Wundt&#x27;s neuropsychological concepts.

== Methodology and strategies ==
&quot;Given its position between the natural sciences and the humanities, psychology really does have a great wealth of methodological tools. While, on the one hand, there are the experimental methods, on the other hand, objective works and products in cultural development (&quot;Objektivationen des menschlichen Geistes&quot;) also offer up abundant material for comparative psychological analysis&quot;.

Psychology is an empirical science and must endeavor to achieve a systematic procedure, examination of results, and criticism of its methodology. Thus self-observation must be trained and is only permissible under strict experimental control; Wundt decisively rejects naive introspection. Wundt provided a standard definition of psychological experiments. His criticism of Immanuel Kant (Wundt, 1874) had a major influence. Kant had argued against the assumption of the measurability of conscious processes and made a well-founded, if very short, criticism of the methods of self-observation: regarding method-inherent reactivity, observer error, distorting attitudes of the subject, and the questionable influence of &quot;independently thinking people&quot;, but Wundt expressed himself optimistic that methodological improvements could be of help here. He later admitted that measurement and mathematics were only applicable for very elementary conscious processes. Statistical methods were also of only limited value, for example in psychophysics or in the evaluation of population statistics.

Experimental psychology in Leipzig mainly lent on four methodological types of assessment: the &quot;impression methods&quot; with their various measurement techniques in psychophysics; the &quot;reaction methods&quot; for chronometry in the psychology of apperception; the &quot;reproduction methods&quot; in research on memory, and the &quot;expression methods&quot; with observations and psychophysiological measurement in research on feelings. Wundt considered the methodology of his linguistic psychological investigations (Vols. 1 and 2 of Völkerpsychologie) to be the most fruitful path to adequate psychological research on the thought process.

The principles of his cultural psychological methodology were only worked out later. These involved the analytical and comparative observation of objective existing materials, i.e. historical writings, language, works, art, reports and observations of human behaviour in earlier cultures and, more rarely, direct ethnological source material. Wundt differentiated between two objectives of comparative methodology: individual comparison collected all the important features of the overall picture of an observation material, while generic comparison formed a picture of variations to obtain a typology. Rules of generic comparison and critical interpretation are essentially explained in his Logik:

&quot;We therefore generally describe the epitome of the methods as interpretation that is intended to provide us with an understanding of mental processes and intellectual creation.&quot; Wundt clearly referred to the tradition of humanistic hermeneutics, but argued that the interpretation process basically also followed psychological principles. Interpretation only became the characteristic process of the humanities through criticism. It is a process that is set against interpretation to dismantle the interaction produced through psychological analysis. It examines external or internal contradictions, it should evaluate the reality of intellectual products, and is also a criticism of values and a criticism of opinions. The typical misconceptions of the intellectualistic, individualistic and unhistorical interpretation of intellectual processes all have &quot;their source in the habitually coarse psychology based on subjective assessment.&quot;

=== Principles of mental causality ===
What is meant by these principles is &quot;the simple prerequisites of the linking of psychological facts that cannot be further extrapolated&quot;. The system of principles has several repeatedly reworked versions, with corresponding laws of development for cultural psychology (Wundt, 1874, 1894, 1897, 1902–1903, 1920, 1921). Wundt mainly differentiated between four principles and explained them with examples that originate from the physiology of perception, the psychology of meaning, from apperception research, emotion and motivation theory, and from cultural psychology and ethics.

#&quot;The Principle of creative synthesis or creative results&quot; (the emergence principle). &quot;Every perception can be broken down into elemental impressions. But it is never just the sum of these impressions, but from the linkage of them that a new one is created with individual features that were not contained in the impressions themselves. We thus put together the mental picture of a spatial form from a multitude of impressions of light. This principle proves itself in all mental causality linkages and accompanies mental development from its first to its consummate stage.&quot; Wundt formulated this creative synthesis, which today would also be described as the principle of emergence in system theory, as an essential epistemological principle of empirical psychology – long before the phrase &quot;the whole is more than the sum of its parts&quot; or supra-summation was used in gestalt psychology.
#&quot;The Principle of relational analysis&quot; (context principle). This principle says that &quot;every individual mental content receives its meaning through the relationships in which it stands to other mental content.&quot;
#&quot;The Principle of mental contrasts or reinforcement of opposites or development in dichotomies.&quot; Typical contrast effects are to be seen in sensory perceptions, in the course of emotions and in volitional processes. There is a general tendency to order the subjective world according to opposites. Thus many individual, historical, economic and social processes exhibit highly contrasting developments.
#&quot;The Principle of the heterogony of purpose (ends).&quot; The consequences of an action extend beyond the original intended purpose and give rise to new motives with new effects. The intended purpose always induces side-effects and knock-on effects that themselves become purposes, i.e. an ever-growing organisation through self-creation. 
In addition to these four principles, Wundt explained the term of intellectual community and other categories and principles that have an important relational and insightful function.

Wundt demands co-ordinated analysis of causal and teleological aspects; he called for a methodologically versatile psychology and did not demand that any decision be made between experimental-statistical methods and interpretative methods (qualitative methods). Whenever appropriate, he referred to findings from interpretation and experimental research within a multimethod approach. Thus, for example, the chapters on the development of language or on enlargement of fantasy activity in cultural psychology also contain experimental, statistical and psychophysiological findings. He was very familiar with these methods and used them in extended research projects. This was without precedent and has, since then, rarely been achieved by another individual researcher.

== Philosophy ==

=== Wundt&#x27;s philosophical orientation ===
In the introduction to his &quot;Grundzüge der physiologischen Psychologie&quot; in 1874, Wundt described Immanuel Kant and Johann Friedrich Herbart as the philosophers who had the most influence on the formation of his own views. Those who follow up these references will find that Wundt critically analysed both these thinkers&#x27; ideas. He distanced himself from Herbart&#x27;s science of the soul and, in particular, from his &quot;mechanism of mental representations&quot; and pseudo-mathematical speculations. While Wundt praised Kant&#x27;s critical work and his rejection of a &quot;rational&quot; psychology deduced from metaphysics, he argued against Kant&#x27;s epistemology in his publication &quot;Was soll uns Kant nicht sein?&quot; (What Kant should we reject?) 1892 with regard to the forms of perception and presuppositions, as well as Kant&#x27;s category theory and his position in the dispute on causal and teleological explanations.

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz had a far greater and more constructive influence on Wundt&#x27;s psychology, philosophy, epistemology and ethics. This can be gleaned from Wundt&#x27;s Leibniz publication (1917) and from his central terms and principles, but has since received almost no attention. Wundt gave up his plans for a biography of Leibniz, but praised Leibniz&#x27;s thinking on the two-hundredth anniversary of his death in 1916. He did, however, disagree with Leibniz&#x27;s monadology as well as theories on the mathematisation of the world by removing the domain of the mind from this view. Leibniz developed a new concept of the soul through his discussion on substance and actuality, on dynamic spiritual change, and on the correspondence between body and soul (parallelism). Wundt &quot;secularised&quot; such guiding principles and reformulated important philosophical positions of Leibniz away from belief in God as the creator and belief in an immortal soul. Wundt gained important ideas and exploited them in an original way in his principles and methodology of empirical psychology: the principle of actuality, psychophysical parallelism, combination of causal and teleological analysis, apperception theory, the psychology of &quot;striving&quot;, i.e. volition and voluntary tendency, principles of epistemology and the perspectivism of thought. Wundt&#x27;s differentiation between the &quot;natural causality&quot; of neurophysiology and the &quot;mental causality&quot; of psychology (the intellect), is a direct rendering from Leibniz&#x27;s epistemology.

Wundt devised the term psychophysical parallelism and meant thereby two fundamentally different ways of considering the postulated psychophysical unit, not just two views in the sense of Fechner&#x27;s theory of identity. Wundt derived the co-ordinated consideration of natural causality and mental causality from Leibniz&#x27;s differentiation between causality and teleology (principle of sufficient reason). The psychological and physiological statements exist in two categorically different reference systems; the main categories are to be emphasised in order to prevent category mistakes. With his epistemology of mental causality, he differed from contemporary authors who also advocated the position of parallelism. Wundt had developed the first genuine epistemology and methodology of empirical psychology.

Wundt shaped the term apperception, introduced by Leibniz, into an experimental psychologically based apperception psychology that included neuropsychological modelling. When Leibniz differentiates between two fundamental functions, perception and striving, this approach can be recognised in Wundt&#x27;s motivation theory. The central theme of &quot;unity in the manifold&quot; (unitas in multitudine) also originates from Leibniz, who has influenced the current understanding of perspectivism and viewpoint dependency. Wundt characterised this style of thought in a way that also applied for him: &quot;…the principle of the equality of viewpoints that supplement one another&quot; plays a significant role in his thinking – viewpoints that &quot;supplement one another, while also being able to appear as opposites that only resolve themselves when considered more deeply.&quot;

Unlike the great majority of contemporary and current authors in psychology, Wundt laid out the philosophical and methodological positions of his work clearly. Wundt was against the founding empirical psychology on a (metaphysical or structural) principle of soul as in Christian belief in an immortal soul or in a philosophy that argues &quot;substance&quot;-ontologically. Wundt&#x27;s position was decisively rejected by several Christianity-oriented psychologists and philosophers as a &quot;psychology without soul&quot;, although he did not use this formulation from Friedrich Lange (1866), who was his predecessor in Zürich from 1870 to 1872. Wundt&#x27;s guiding principle was the development theory of the mind. Wundt&#x27;s ethics also led to polemical critiques due to his renunciation of an ultimate transcendental basis of ethics (God, the Absolute). Wundt&#x27;s evolutionism was also criticised for its claim that ethical norms had been culturally changed in the course of human intellectual development.

Wundt&#x27;s autobiography and his inaugural lectures in Zurich and Leipzig as well as his commemorative speeches for Fechner and his Essay on Leibniz provide an insight into the history of Wundt&#x27;s education and the contemporary flows and intellectual controversies in the second half of the 19th century. Wundt primarily refers to Leibniz and Kant, more indirectly to Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling and Arthur Schopenhauer; and to Johann Friedrich Herbart, Gustav Theodor Fechner and Hermann Lotze regarding psychology. In addition to John Locke, George Berkeley, David Hume and John Stuart Mill, one finds Francis Bacon, Charles Darwin and Charles Spencer, as well as French thinkers such as Auguste Comte and Hippolyte Taine, all of whom are more rarely quoted by Wundt.

=== Metaphysics ===

Wundt distanced himself from the metaphysical term soul and from theories about its structure and properties, as posited by Herbart, Lotze, and Fechner. Wundt followed Kant and warned against a primarily metaphysically founded, philosophically deduced psychology: &quot;where one notices the author&#x27;s metaphysical point-of-view in the treatment of every problem then an unconditional empirical science is no longer involved – but a metaphysical theory intended to serve as an exemplification of experience.&quot; 
He is, however, convinced that every single science contains general prerequisites of a philosophical nature. &quot;All psychological investigation extrapolates from metaphysical presuppositions.&quot; Epistemology was to help sciences find out about, clarify or supplement their metaphysical aspects and as far as possible free themselves of them. Psychology and the other sciences always rely on the help of philosophy here, and particularly on logic and epistemology, otherwise only an immanent philosophy, i.e. metaphysical assumptions of an unsystematic nature, would form in the individual sciences. Wundt is decidedly against the segregation of philosophy. He is concerned about psychologists bringing their own personal metaphysical convictions into psychology and that these presumptions would no longer be exposed to epistemological criticism. &quot;Therefore nobody would suffer more from such a segregation than the psychologists themselves and, through them, psychology.&quot; &quot;Nothing would promote the degeneration [of psychology] to a mere craftsmanship more than its segregation from philosophy.&quot;

=== System of philosophy ===
Wundt claimed that philosophy as a general science has the task of &quot;uniting to become a consistent system through the general knowledge acquired via the individual sciences.&quot; Human rationality strives for a uniform, i.e. non-contradictory, explanatory principle for being and consciousness, for an ultimate reasoning for ethics, and for a philosophical world basis. &quot;Metaphysics is the same attempt to gain a binding world view, as a component of individual knowledge, on the basis of the entire scientific awareness of an age or particularly prominent content.&quot; Wundt was convinced that empirical psychology also contributed fundamental knowledge on the understanding of humans – for anthropology and ethics – beyond its narrow scientific field. Starting from the active and creative-synthetic apperception processes of consciousness, Wundt considered that the unifying function was to be found in volitional processes and the conscious setting of objectives and subsequent activities. &quot;There is simply nothing more to a man that he can entirely call his own – except for his will.&quot; One can detect a &quot;voluntaristic tendency&quot; in Wundt&#x27;s theory of motivation, in contrast to the currently widespread cognitivism (intellectualism). Wundt extrapolated this empirically founded volitional psychology to a metaphysical voluntarism. He demands, however, that the empirical-psychological and derived metaphysical voluntarism are kept apart from one another and firmly maintained that his empirical psychology was created independently of the various teachings of metaphysics.

Wundt interpreted intellectual-cultural progress and biological evolution as a general process of development whereby, however, he did not want to follow the abstract ideas of entelechy, vitalism, animism, and by no means Schopenhauer&#x27;s volitional metaphysics. He believed that the source of dynamic development was to be found in the most elementary expressions of life, in reflexive and instinctive behaviour, and constructed a continuum of attentive and apperceptive processes, volitional or selective acts, up to social activities and ethical decisions. At the end of this rational idea he recognised a practical ideal: the idea of humanity as the highest yardstick of our actions and that the overall course of human history can be understood with regard to the ideal of humanity.
=== Ethics ===
Parallel to Wundt&#x27;s work on cultural psychology he wrote his much-read &quot;Ethik&quot; (1886, 3rd ed. in 2 Vols., 1903), whose introduction stressed how important development considerations are in order to grasp religion, customs and morality. Wundt considered the questions of ethics to be closely linked with the empirical psychology of motivated acts &quot;Psychology has been such an important introduction for me, and such an indispensable aid for the investigation of ethics, that I do not understand how one could do without it.&quot; Wundt sees two paths: the anthropological examination of the facts of a moral life (in the sense of cultural psychology) and the scientific reflection on the concepts of morals. The derived principles are to be examined in a variety of areas: the family, society, the state, education, etc. In his discussion on free will (as an attempt to mediate between determinism and indeterminism) he categorically distinguishes between two perspectives: there is indeed a natural causality of brain processes, though conscious processes are not determined by an intelligible, but by the empirical character of humans – volitional acts are subject to the principles of mental causality. &quot;When a man only follows inner causality he acts freely in an ethical sense, which is partly determined by his original disposition and partly by the development of his character.&quot;

On the one hand, Ethics is a normative discipline while, on the other hand, these &#x27;rules&#x27; change, as can be seen from the empirical examination of culture-related morality. Wundt&#x27;s ethics can, put simply, be interpreted as an attempt to mediate between Kant&#x27;s apriorism and empiricism. Moral rules are the legislative results of a universal intellectual development, but are neither rigidly defined nor do they simply follow changing life conditions. Individualism and utilitarianism are strictly rejected. In his view, only the universal intellectual life can be considered to be an end in itself. Wundt also spoke on the idea of humanity in ethics, on human rights and human duties in his speech as Rector of Leipzig University in 1889 on the centenary of the French Revolution.

=== Logic, epistemology and the scientific theory of psychology ===
Wundt divided up his three-volume &quot;Logik&quot; into General logic and epistemology, Logic of the exact sciences, and Logic of the humanities. While logic, the doctrine of categories, and other principles were discussed by Wundt in a traditional manner, they were also considered from the point of view of development theory of the human intellect, i.e. in accordance with the psychology of thought. The subsequent equitable description of the special principles of the natural sciences and the humanities enabled Wundt to create a new epistemology. The ideas that remain current include epistemology and the methodology of psychology: the tasks and directions of psychology, the methods of interpretation and comparison, as well as psychological experimentation.

The list of works at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science includes a total of 589 German and foreign-language editions for the period from 1853 to 1950 MPI für Wissenschaftsgeschichte: &quot;Werkverzeichnis Wilhelm Wundt&quot;.The American psychologist Edwin Boring counted 494 publications by Wundt (excluding pure reprints but with revised editions) that are, on average, 110 pages long and amount to a total of 53,735 pages. Thus Wundt published an average of seven works per year over a period of 68 years and wrote or revised an average of 2.2 pages per day. There is as yet no annotated edition of the essential writings, nor does a complete edition of Wundt&#x27;s major works exist, apart from more-or-less suitable scans or digitalisations.

Apart from his library and his correspondence, Wundt&#x27;s extraordinarily extensive written inheritance also includes many extracts, manuscripts, lecture notes and other materials Wundt&#x27;s written inheritance in Leipzig consists of 5,576 documents, mainly letters, and was digitalised by the Leipzig University Library. The catalogue is available at the &quot;Kalliope online portal&quot;.

One-third of Wundt&#x27;s own library was left to his children Eleonore and Max Wundt; most of the works were sold during the times of need after the First World War to Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan. The university&#x27;s stock consists of 6,762 volumes in western languages (including bound periodicals) as well as 9,098 special print runs and brochures from the original Wundt Library. The list in the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science only mentions 575 of these entries. Tübingen University Archive&#x27;s stock includes copies of 613 letters, Wundt&#x27;s will, lists from Wundt&#x27;s original library, and other materials and &#x27;Wundtiana&#x27;: The German Historical Museum in Berlin has a 1918 shellac disk on which Wundt repeats the closing words of his inaugural lecture (given in Zürich on 31 October 1874 and re-read in 1918 for documentation purposes): &quot;On the task of philosophy in the present&quot;

=== Biographies ===
The last Wundt biography which tried to represent both Wundt&#x27;s psychology and his philosophy was by Eisler (1902). One can also get an idea of Wundt&#x27;s thoughts from his autobiography &quot;Erlebtes und Erkanntes&quot; (1920). Later biographies by Nef (1923) and Petersen (1925) up to Arnold in 1980 restrict themselves primarily to the psychology &quot;or&quot; the philosophy. Eleonore Wundt&#x27;s (1928) knowledgeable but short biography of her father exceeds many others&#x27; efforts.

=== Political attitude ===
At the start of the First World War, Wundt, like Edmund Husserl and Max Planck, signed the patriotic call to arms as did about 4,000 professors and lecturers in Germany, and during the following years he wrote several political speeches and essays that were also characterized by the feeling of a superiority of German science and culture.

During Wundt&#x27;s early Heidelberg time he espoused liberal views. He co-founded the Association of German Workers&#x27; Associations. He was a member of the liberal Progressive Party of Baden. From 1866 to 1869 he represented Heidelberg in the Baden States Assembly.

In old age Wundt appeared to become more conservative (see Wundt, 1920; Wundt&#x27;s correspondence), then – also in response to World War I, the subsequent social unrest and the severe revolutionary events of the post-war period – adopted an attitude that was patriotic and lent towards nationalism.

Wilhelm Wundt&#x27;s son, philosopher Max Wundt, had an even more clearly intense, somewhat nationalist, stance. Although not a member of the Nazi party (NSDAP), Max Wundt wrote about national traditions and race in philosophical thinking.

=== Wundt Societies ===
Four &quot;Wilhelm Wundt Societies&quot; or Associations have been founded:

* 1925 to 1968: &quot;Wilhelm Wundt Stiftung und Verband Freunde des Psychologischen Instituts der Universität Leipzig&quot;, founded by former assistants and friends of Wundts.
* 1979: &quot;Wilhelm Wundt Gesellschaft&quot; (based in Heidelberg), &quot;a scientific association with a limited number of members set up with the aim of promoting fundamental psychological research and further developing it through its efforts.&quot; 
* 1992 to 1996: &quot;Wundt-Stiftung e.V. und Förderverein Wundt-Stiftung e.V.&quot; (based in Bonn/Leipzig). 
* 2016: &quot;Förderverein Wilhelm-Wundt-Haus in Grossbothen.&quot;. The purpose of the association is &quot;the maintenance and restoration of the Wundt home in keeping with its listed building status, as well as its appropriate use&quot;. The association was founded on the initiative of Jüttemann (2014).

The &quot;Deutsche Gesellschaft für Psychologie&quot; German Society for Psychology grants a Wilhelm-Wundt Medal.

== Reception of Wundt&#x27;s work ==
=== Reception by his contemporaries ===
The psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin described the pioneering spirit at the new Leipzig Institute in this fashion: &quot;We felt that we were trailblazers entering virgin territory, like creators of a science with undreamt-of prospects. Wundt spent several afternoons every week in his adjacent modest Professorial office, came to see us, advised us and often got involved in the experiments; he was also available to us at any time.&quot;

The philosopher Rudolf Eisler considered Wundt&#x27;s approach as follows: &quot;A major advantage of Wundt&#x27;s philosophy is that it neither consciously nor unconsciously takes metaphysics back to its beginnings, but strictly distinguishes between empirical-scientific and epistemological-metaphysical approaches, and considers each point-of-view in isolation in its relative legitimacy before finally producing a uniform world view. Wundt always differentiates between the physical-physiological and the purely psychological, and then again from the philosophical point-of-view. As a result, apparent &#x27;contradictions&#x27; are created for those who do not observe more precisely and who constantly forget that the differences in results are only due to the approach and not the laws of reality ...&quot; Traugott Oesterreich (1923/1951) wrote an unusually detailed description of Wundt&#x27;s work in his Grundriss der Geschichte der Philosophie (Foundations of the History of Philosophy). This knowledgeable representation examines Wundt&#x27;s main topics, views and scientific activities and exceeds the generally much briefer Wundt reception within the field of psychology, in which many of the important prerequisites and references are ignored right from the start.

The internal consistency of Wundt&#x27;s work from 1862 to 1920, between the main works and within the reworked editions, has repeatedly been discussed and been subject to differing assessments in parts. One could not say that the scientific conception of psychology underwent a fundamental revision of principal ideas and central postulates, though there was gradual development and a change in emphasis. One could consider Wundt&#x27;s gradual concurrence with Kant&#x27;s position, that conscious processes are not measurable on the basis of self-observation and cannot be mathematically formulated, to be a major divergence. Wundt, however, never claimed that psychology could be advanced through experiment and measurement alone, but had already stressed in 1862 that the development history of the mind and comparative psychology should provide some assistance.

Wundt attempted to redefine and restructure the fields of psychology and philosophy.
 &quot;Experimental psychology in the narrower sense and child psychology form individual psychology, while cultural and animal psychology are both parts of a general and comparative psychology&quot;). None of his Leipzig assistants and hardly any textbook authors in the subsequent two generations have adopted Wundt&#x27;s broad theoretical horizon, his demanding scientific theory or the multi-method approach. Oswald Külpe had already ruled cultural and animal psychology out.

While the &quot;Principles of physiological Psychology&quot; met with worldwide resonance, Wundt&#x27;s cultural psychology (ethno-psychology) appeared to have had a less widespread impact. But there are indications that George Herbert Mead and Franz Boas, among others, were influenced by it. In his Totem and Taboo, Sigmund Freud frequently quoted Wundt&#x27;s cultural psychology. In its time, Wundt&#x27;s Ethik received more reviews than almost any of his other main works. Most of the objections were ranged against his renouncing any ultimate transcendental ethical basis (God, the Absolute), as well as against his ideas regarding evolution, i.e. that ethical standards changed culturally in the course of human intellectual development. As Wundt did not describe any concrete ethical conflicts on the basis of examples and did not describe any social ethics in particular, his teachings with the general idea of humanism appear rather too abstract.

The &quot;XXII International Congress for Psychology in Leipzig in 1980&quot;, i.e. on the hundredth jubilee of the initial founding of the institute in 1879, stimulated a number of publications about Wundt, also in the US Very little productive research work has been carried out since then. While Wundt was occasionally mentioned in the centenary review of the founding of the &quot;German Society for Experimental Psychology&quot; 1904/2004, it was without the principal ideas of his psychology and philosophy of science.

=== Research on reception of his work ===
Leipzig was a world-famous centre for the new psychology after 1874. There are various interpretations regarding why Wundt&#x27;s influence after the turn of the century, i.e. during his lifetime, rapidly waned and from his position as founding father Wundt became almost an outsider. A survey was conducted on the basis of more than 200 contemporary and later sources: reviews and critiques of his publications (since 1858), references to Wundt&#x27;s work in textbooks on psychology and the history of psychology (from 1883 to 2010), biographies, congress reports, praise on his decadal birthdays, obituaries and other texts. A range of scientific controversies were presented in detail. Reasons for the distancing of Wundt and why some of his concepts have fallen into oblivion can be seen in his scientific work, in his philosophical orientation, in his didactics or in the person of Wundt himself:

*Possibly the most important reason for Wundt&#x27;s relatively low influence might lie in his highly ambitious epistemologically founded conception of psychology, in his theory of science and in the level of difficulty involved in his wide-ranging methodology.
* Most psychologies in the subsequent generation appear to have a considerably simpler, less demanding, philosophical point-of-view instead of coordinated causal and teleological considerations embedded in multiple reference systems that consequently also demanded a multi-method approach. Thus instead of perspectivism and a change in perspective an apparently straightforward approach is preferred, i.e. research oriented upon either the natural sciences or the humanities.
* Wundt&#x27;s assistants and colleagues, many of whom were also personally close, did not take on the role of students and certainly not the role of interpreters. Oswald Külpe, Ernst Meumann, Hugo Münsterberg or Felix Krueger did not want to, or could not, adequately reference Wundt&#x27;s comprehensive scientific conception of psychology in their books, for example they almost entirely ignored Wundt&#x27;s categories and epistemological principles, his strategies in comparison and interpretation, the discussions regarding Kant&#x27;s in-depth criticism of methodology, and Wundt&#x27;s neuropsychology. Nobody in this circle developed a creative continuation of Wundt&#x27;s concepts. Krueger&#x27;s inner distance to a scientific concept and the entire work of his predecessor cannot be overlooked.
* Through his definition of &quot;soul&quot; as an actual process, Wundt gave up the metaphysical idea of a &quot;substantial carrier&quot;; his psychology without a soul was heavily criticized by several contemporary and later psychologists and philosophers.
* Wundt exposed himself to criticism with his theoretical and experimental psychologically differentiated apperception psychology as opposed to elemental association psychology, and with his comprehensive research programme on a development theory of the human intellect, now seen as an interdisciplinary or trans-disciplinary project.

=== Misunderstandings of basic terms and principles ===
Wundt&#x27;s terminology also created difficulties because he had – from today&#x27;s point-of-view – given some of his most important ideas unfortunate names so that there were constant misunderstandings. Examples include:
* &quot;physiological psychology&quot; – specifically not a scientific physiological psychology, because by writing the adjective with a small letter Wundt wanted to avoid this misunderstanding that still exists today; for him it was the use of physiological aids in experimental general psychology that mattered. 
* &quot;Self-observation&quot; – not naive introspection, but with training and experimental control of conditions.
* &quot;Experiment&quot; – this was meant with reference to Francis Bacon – general, i.e. far beyond the scientific rules of the empirical sciences, so not necessarily a statistically evaluated laboratory experiment. For Wundt psychological experimentation primarily served as a check of trained self-observation. 
* &quot;Element&quot; – not in the sense of the smallest structure, but as a smallest unit of the intended level under consideration, so that, for example, even the central nervous system could be an &quot;element&quot;. 
* &quot;Völkerpsychologie&quot; – cultural psychology – not ethnology.
* &quot;Apperception&quot; – not just an increase in attention, but a central and multimodal synthesis. 
* &quot;Voluntaristic tendency, voluntarism&quot; – not an absolute metaphysical postulate, but a primary empirically psychologically based accentuation of motivated action against the intellectualism and cognitivism of other psychologists.

A representation of Wundt&#x27;s psychology as &#x27;natural science&#x27;, &#x27;element psychology&#x27; or &#x27;dualistic&#x27; conceptions is evidence of enduring misunderstandings. It is therefore necessary to remember Wundt&#x27;s expressly stated desire for uniformity and lack of contradiction, for the mutual supplementation of psychological perspectives. Wundt&#x27;s more demanding, sometimes more complicated and relativizing, then again very precise style can also be difficult – even for today&#x27;s German readers; a high level of linguistic competence is required. There are only English translations for very few of Wundt&#x27;s work. In particular, the &quot;Grundzüge der physiologischen Psychologie&quot; expanded into three volumes and the ten volumes of Völkerpsychologie, all the books on philosophy and important essays on the theory of science remain untranslated.

Such shortcomings may explain many of the fundamental deficits and lasting misunderstandings in the Anglo-American reception of Wundt&#x27;s work. Massive misconceptions about Wundt&#x27;s work have been demonstrated by William James, Granville Stanley Hall, Edward Boring and Edward Titchener as well as among many later authors. Titchener, a two-year resident of Wundt&#x27;s lab and one of Wundt&#x27;s most vocal advocates in the United States, is responsible for several English translations and mistranslations of Wundt&#x27;s works that supported his own views and approach, which he termed &quot;structuralism&quot; and claimed was wholly consistent with Wundt&#x27;s position.
As Wundt&#x27;s three-volume Logik und Wissenschaftslehre, i.e. his theory of science, also remains untranslated the close interrelationships between Wundt&#x27;s empirical psychology and his epistemology and methodology, philosophy and ethics are also regularly missing, even if later collections describe individual facets of them. Blumenthal&#x27;s assessment that &quot;American textbook accounts of Wundt now present highly inaccurate and mythological caricatures of the man and his work&quot; still appears to be true of most publications about Wundt.
A highly contradictory picture emerges from any systematic research on his reception. On the one hand, the pioneer of experimental psychology and founder of modern psychology as a discipline is praised, on the other hand, his work is insufficiently tapped and appears to have had little influence. Misunderstandings and stereotypical evaluations continue into the present, even in some representations of the history of psychology and in textbooks. Wundt&#x27;s entire work is investigated in a more focused manner in more recent assessments regarding the reception of Wundt, and his theory of science and his philosophy is included (Araujo, 2016; Danziger, 1983, 1990, 2001; Fahrenberg, 2011, 2015, 2016; Jüttemann, 2006; Kim, 2016; van Rappard, 1980).

=== Scientific controversies and criticisms ===
Like other important psychologists and philosophers, Wundt was subject to ideological criticism, for example by authors of a more Christianity-based psychology, by authors with materialistic and positivistic scientific opinions, or from the point-of-view of Marxist-Leninist philosophy and social theory, as in Leipzig, German Democratic Republic, up to 1990. 
Wundt was involved in a number of scientific controversies or was responsible for triggering them:
* the Wundt-Zeller controversy about the measurability of awareness processes,
* the Wundt-Meumann controversy about the necessary scope of the scientific principles of applied psychology,
* the Wundt-Bühler controversy about the methodology of the psychology of thought,
* the controversy about the psychology of elemental (passive-mechanic) association and integrative (self-active) apperception,
* the controversy about empirio-criticism, positivism and critical realism, and 
* the controversy about psychologism.

There are many forms of criticism of Wundt&#x27;s psychology, of his apperception psychology, of his motivation theory, of his version of psychophysical parallelism with its concept of &quot;mental causality&quot;, his refutation of psychoanalytic speculation about the unconscious, or of his critical realism. A recurring criticism is that Wundt largely ignored the areas of psychology that he found less interesting, such as differential psychology, child psychology and educational psychology. In his cultural psychology there is no empirical social psychology because there were still no methods for investigating it at the time. Among his postgraduate students, assistants and other colleagues, however, were several important pioneers: differential psychology, &quot;mental measurement&quot; and intelligence testing (James McKeen Cattell, Charles Spearman), social psychology of group pocesses and the psychology of work (Walther Moede), applied psychology (Ernst Meumann, Hugo Münsterberg), psychopathology, psychopharmacology and clinical diagnosis (Emil Kraepelin). Wundt further influenced many American psychologists to create psychology graduate programs.

== Wundt&#x27;s excellence ==
Wundt developed the first comprehensive and uniform theory of the science of psychology. The special epistemological and methodological status of psychology is postulated in this wide-ranging conceptualization, characterized by his neurophysiological, psychological and philosophical work. The human as a thinking and motivated subject is not to be captured in the terms of the natural sciences. Psychology requires special categories and autonomous epistemological principles. It is, on the one hand, an empirical humanity but should not, on the other hand, ignore its physiological basis and philosophical assumptions. Thus a varied, multi-method approach is necessary: self-observation, experimentation, generic comparison and interpretation. Wundt demanded the ability and readiness to distinguish between perspectives and reference systems, and to understand the necessary supplementation of these reference systems in changes of perspective. He defined the field of psychology very widely and as interdisciplinary, and also explained just how indispensable is the epistemological-philosophical criticism of psychological theories and their philosophical prerequisites. Psychology should remain connected with philosophy in order to promote this critique of knowledge of the metaphysical presuppositions so widespread among psychologists.

The conceptual relationships within the complete works created over decades and continuously reworked have hardly been systematically investigated. The most important theoretical basis is the empirical-psychological theory of apperception, based on Leibniz&#x27;s philosophical position, that Wundt, on the one hand, based on experimental psychology and his neuropsychological modelling and, on the other hand, extrapolated into a development theory for culture. The fundamental reconstruction of Wundt&#x27;s main ideas is a task that cannot be achieved by any one person today due to the complexity of the complete works. He tried to connect the fundamental controversies of the research directions epistemologically and methodologically by means of a co-ordinated concept – in a confident handling of the categorically basically different ways of considering the interrelations. Here, during the founding phase of university psychology, he already argued for a highly demanding meta-science meta-scientific reflection – and this potential to stimulate interdisciplinarity und perspectivism (complementary approaches) has by no means been exhausted.

<text>In biology, a weapon is a specialized physical trait that is used by animals to compete with other individuals for resources. Most commonly, the term refers to structures that males use to fight other males off for access to mates. They can also be used to defend resources in intraspecific competition, or to ward off predators. Examples of weapons include horns and antlers, both among the most recognizable weapons, though even within those categories, the structure of the specific weaponry is often unique to the species, with a wide variety of designs observed across many genera.

Many weapons evolve through sexual selection, as they are most often used to fight off competitors for access to mates. A mate is won in battle either by a male chasing off a fellow competitor or killing it, usually leaving the victor as the only option for the female to reproduce with, favoring males with particularly effective weaponry. More broadly, weaponry in animals may consist of any specialized morphology that is present within an organism to aid in its advantage against rivals. Many hypotheses have been produced by researchers to possibly explain the mechanisms behind the evolution of weapons, with studies detailing the intensity, duration, and conclusion of intraspecific combat, as well as analyzing the rapid diversification within species. 

Since Darwin&#x27;s publication The Descent of Man, extensive research has been done on the presence of agonistic behavior and the usage of animal weaponry by different species. Weaponry displays in animals have been found to increase their likelihood of survival in different ways, such as when interacting with other individuals or trying to find another mate, or to defend against predators.        

==Occurrence==

Weapons are common among many genera of animals. Among vertebrates, they are most often found in mammals and fish, and are also known to occur in reptiles, though far less commonly in that class. Many species of dinosaur, an extinct clade of vertebrates, also possessed weapons. Arthropods, such as arachnids and crabs, also have species that wield weapons, and they are extraordinarily widespread among insects. 

In mammals, weapons are common and take a number of diverse forms. They are most common among the ungulates. Antlers, complex and unique weapons that are an extension of an animal&#x27;s skull, are found among male deers, as well as female reindeers, ungulates who are even-toed ruminants. Horns, permanent pointed projections consisting of a covering of keratin and other proteins surrounding a core of live bone, are found commonly among bovids, as well as the pronghorns, which are ruminant artiodactyls. Rhinoceroses are odd-toed ungulates which have horns made of keratin; both sexes use these horns in contests with other individuals of the same species. Walruses and elephants, non-ungulates, both possess elongated tusks. Apart from mammals, the only other group of land vertebrates that shows widespread adoption of weapons are the chameleons, who possess horn-like structures for fighting over access to mates.

Some species of fish have weapons, though these traits are not as widespread as in mammals. Sawfish are named for their long rostrum, which can be used to inflict damage on other fish. Unicornfish may also use their strange horn-like forehead protection as a weapon, although the general use of this and many similar structures in fish are still somewhat enigmatic. Male salmon notably feature intraspecific competition for mates, and they use their elongated and toothy jaw to fight other males, both over access to females and over access to breeding sites. 

Weapons are very widespread among insects, having been observed in nearly every major taxonomic group. Insects possess a huge variety of weapons, often with entirely different uses and modes of action. Rhinoceros beetles, like the mammal they are named for, have large horns which they famously use to fight for mates. Stag beetles have enlarged mandibles, which resemble the antlers of stags. Male stag beetles use these weapons to wrestle each other for favoured mating sites in a way that parallels the way stags fight over females. Fights may also be over food, such as tree sap and decaying fruits. Harlequin beetles have legs that are longer than their entire body, using which they protect a suitable spot for a female to lay eggs. They also possess strong mandibles to bite other males, which can include removing their legs. Camel crickets use spines on their tibias for two reasons; (1) to fight other males for access to females, and (2) to pin mates as a form of coercion. Among arthropods that are not insects, male fiddler crabs have large claws that comprise half their body mass and are used to attract mates elaborate waving displays with the claw. They are also, though somewhat less commonly, used as a weapon to directly attack other males.

== Evolution ==
Animal weaponry is capable of drastic and rapid diversification in form, with closely related species, even within the same clade, having distinctly different weaponry. One hypothesized mechanism for this is the gradual change in weaponry function from purely physical agonistic behavior, to a stronger emphasis on display, resulting in potentially more elaborate weapons. For instance, many dinosaurs may have had structures that were once weapons but were later used as ornaments to attract mates. Another possible mechanism is the presence of male-male combat, with diverging lineages of animals expanding into different habitats and then fighting under different conditions. Changes in the physical contest between species in different environments may potentially drive the evolution in modified weaponry. Sites that have localized, defendable resources, like a single food or water source, or a breeding burrow, often are where species with weapons are found.

Sexual selection has been a main focus on weaponry and antagonist interactions between animals, with males that present the largest weapons having the highest probability of winning. Sexual selection has been credited by previous researchers as the main influence of nature&#x27;s extravagant weaponry for the purpose of attractive females. During agonistic interactions, there is the potential risk of weaponry lost resulting in a possible decrease in an individual&#x27;s fighting ability and overall fitness.

Most animal weapons probably emerged independently. The weapons of ungulates, for instance, are believed to have evolved independently during the Age of Mammals, and are not from an earlier, basal clade of mammals. One group that had weapons early in the history of multicellular life were the trilobites, one of the earliest arthropods, and a dominant life form in the Paleozoic. Many species had horns or spikes which are theorized to have been used in intraspecific combat. Many dinosaurs also had weapons such as spines, spikes, and plates, although the exact use of these is not known for all species—some may have been used for mating displays more than as weapons.

An exception to the general independence of weapon evolution is found in stag beetles, whose common ancestor is believed to have had mandibles, much like modern stag beetles. However, that species likely had little or no sexual dimorphism in the mandible phenotype, unlike modern stag beetles, in which males usually have markedly larger mandibles than females. Dung beetles, on the other hand, have evolved and lost their weapons many, many times over their history, with the single genus &quot;Onthophagus&quot;, whose ancestor likely had horns, undergoing at least ten evolutionary events where horns were gained or lost.

== Usage &amp; Characteristics ==
Agonistic behaviors amongst animals for resources have been studied by many researchers, and specifically the interaction of weapons during these exchanges of behavior. Not only the presence of weaponry, but also specific characteristics of the weaponry itself can have an effect on the outcome of competition in determining the winners and losers from an intraspecies competition. The display of weaponry has been found to be favored in animals that frequently engage in contest as a mechanism to decrease the costs of aggression.

Most weapons that are studied are utilize to injure other individuals. These include the most famous weapons, such as antlers, horns, and mandibles; conversely, some animals have specialized &quot;weapons&quot; that actually fulfill a defensive role, such as the horned weevil, which have that can neutralize the horns of other beetles. Some of these weapons can be used to inject chemicals into enemies; tentacles and stingers are examples of this phenomenon. Other weapons are used to displace their opponents, usually to block burrows or entrances from other individuals. Some termites, for instance, use their heads as plugs to physically impede other termites from invading through the colony entrance. These termites also use their mandibles to displace enemies. Finally, many weapons are used for displays, with males using their large physical features to attract females to mate with. Additionally, most organisms display their weapons before fighting as a threat to other individuals. In general, displays are considered any behavior that is used to show a species&#x27; fighting ability without any physical contact, and the term applies to signalling both potential mates and potential opponents. This behavior allows for rivals to have the chance to assess the weaponry that is present to determine whether to engage in physical agonistic behavior or not.

===Female Weaponry===
Since the publication of The Descent of Man and The Origin of Species, research has been heavily focused on weaponry in male animals, potentially leaving out females and their possible mechanisms behind present weaponry. Presence of weapons in females, and female-female competition has been seen in many species for better fitness of both sexual and social selection. Social selection, first hypothesized by Mary Jane West-Eberhard, is a broader term that includes both sexual and non sexual behaviors to increase an individual&#x27;s fitness. For example, research has suggested that horns present in female bovids, may have evolved from competition for resources such as food.

<text>WarGames is a 1983 American techno-thriller film directed by John Badham, written by Lawrence Lasker and Walter F. Parkes, and starring Matthew Broderick, Dabney Coleman, John Wood and Ally Sheedy. Broderick plays David Lightman, a young computer hacker who unwittingly accesses a United States military supercomputer programmed to simulate, predict and execute nuclear war against the Soviet Union, triggering a false alarm that threatens to start World War III.

The film premiered at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival, and was released by MGM/UA Entertainment on June 3, 1983. It was a widespread critical and commercial success, grossing $125 million worldwide against a $12 million budget. At the 56th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for three Oscars, including Best Original Screenplay. It also won a BAFTA Award for Best Sound.

&quot;WarGames&quot; is credited with popularizing concepts of computer hacking, information technology, and cybersecurity in wider American society. It spawned several video games, a , and a 2018 interactive series.

== Plot ==
During a surprise nuclear attack drill, many United States Air Force Strategic Missile Wing controllers prove unwilling to turn the keys required to launch a missile strike. Such refusals convince John McKittrick and other North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) systems engineers that missile launch control centers must be automated, without human intervention. Control is given to a NORAD supercomputer known as WOPR (War Operation Plan Response, pronounced &quot;whopper&quot;), or Joshua, programmed to continuously run war simulations and learn over time.

David Lightman, a bright but unmotivated Seattle high school student and hacker, uses his IMSAI 8080 computer and modem to access the school district&#x27;s computer system and change the grades for himself and his friend and classmate, Jennifer Mack. Later, while war dialing numbers in Sunnyvale, California, to find a computer game company, he connects with a system that does not identify itself. Asking for games, he finds a list including chess, checkers, backgammon and poker, along with titles such as &quot;Theaterwide Biotoxic and Chemical Warfare&quot; and &quot;Global Thermonuclear War&quot;, but cannot proceed further. Two hacker friends explain the concept of a backdoor password and suggest tracking down the Falken referenced in &quot;Falken&#x27;s Maze&quot;, the first game listed. David discovers that Stephen Falken was an early artificial-intelligence researcher, and guesses correctly that the name of Falken&#x27;s deceased son (Joshua) is the password.

Unaware that the Sunnyvale phone number connects to WOPR at the Cheyenne Mountain Complex, David initiates a game of Global Thermonuclear War, playing as the Soviet Union while targeting American cities. The computer starts a simulation that briefly convinces NORAD military personnel that actual Soviet nuclear missiles are inbound. While they defuse the situation, WOPR nonetheless continues the simulation to trigger the scenario and win the game, as it does not understand the difference between reality and simulation. It continuously feeds false data such as Soviet bomber incursions and submarine deployments to NORAD, pushing them to increase the DEFCON level toward a retaliation that will start World War III.

David learns the true nature of his actions from a news broadcast, and FBI special agents arrest him and take him to NORAD. He realizes that WOPR is behind the NORAD alerts, but he fails to convince McKittrick (who believes David is working for the Soviets) and is charged with espionage. David escapes NORAD by joining a tourist group and, with Jennifer&#x27;s help, travels to the Oregon island where Falken lives under the alias &quot;Robert Hume&quot;. David and Jennifer find that Falken has become despondent, believing that nuclear war is inevitable and as futile as a game of tic-tac-toe between two experienced players. The teenagers convince Falken that he should return to NORAD to stop WOPR.

WOPR stages a massive Soviet first strike with hundreds of missiles, submarines, and bombers. Believing the attack to be genuine, NORAD prepares to retaliate. Falken, David, and Jennifer convince military officials to delay the second strike and ride out the supposed attack until actual weapons impacts are confirmed. When the targeted American bases (Elmendorf Air Force Base, Grand Forks Air Force Base, and Loring Air Force Base) report back unharmed, NORAD prepares to cancel the retaliatory second strike. WOPR tries to launch the missiles on its own using a brute-force attack to obtain the launch codes. Without humans in the control centers as a safeguard using the two-man rule, the computer will trigger a mass launch. All attempts to log in and order WOPR to cancel the countdown fail. Disconnecting the computer is discussed and dismissed, as a fail-deadly mechanism will launch all weapons if the computer is disabled.

Falken and David direct the computer to play tic-tac-toe against itself. This results in a long string of draws, forcing the computer to learn the concept of futility and no-win scenarios. WOPR obtains the launch codes, but before launching, it cycles through all the nuclear war scenarios it has devised, finding that they all result in draws as well. Having discovered the concept of mutual assured destruction (&quot;WINNER: NONE&quot;), the computer tells Falken it has concluded that nuclear war is &quot;a strange game&quot; in which &quot;the only winning move is not to play.&quot; WOPR relinquishes control of NORAD and the missiles and offers to play &quot;a nice game of chess&quot;.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
=== Development ===
Development on &quot;WarGames&quot; began in 1979, when writers Walter F. Parkes and Lawrence Lasker developed an idea for a script called &quot;The Genius&quot;, about &quot;a dying scientist and the only person in the world who understands him—a rebellious kid who&#x27;s too smart for his own good&quot;. Lasker was inspired by a television special presented by Peter Ustinov on several geniuses, including Stephen Hawking. Lasker said, &quot;I found the predicament Hawking was in fascinating — that he might one day figure out the unified field theory and not be able to tell anyone, because of his progressive ALS. So there was this idea that he&#x27;d need a successor. And who would that be? Maybe this kid, a juvenile delinquent whose problem was that nobody realized he was too smart for his environment.&quot; The concept of computers and hacking as part of the film was not yet present.

&quot;The Genius&quot; began its transformation into &quot;WarGames&quot; when Parkes and Lasker met Peter Schwartz from the Stanford Research Institute. &quot;There was a new subculture of extremely bright kids developing into what would become known as hackers,&quot; said Schwartz. Schwartz made the connection between youth, computers, gaming, and the military. Parkes and Lasker also met with computer-security expert Willis Ware of RAND Corporation, who assured them that even a secure military computer might have remote access enabling remote work on weekends, encouraging the screenwriters to continue with the project.

Parkes and Lasker came up with several military-themed plotlines before the final story. One version of the script had an early version of the WOPR named &quot;Uncle Ollie&quot;, or Omnipresent Laser Interceptor (OLI), a space-based defensive laser run by an intelligent program, but this idea was discarded because it was too speculative. Director John Badham coined the name &quot;WOPR&quot;, feeling that the name of NORAD&#x27;s Single Integrated Operational Plan was &quot;boring, and told you nothing&quot;. The name &quot;WOPR&quot; played off the Whopper hamburger, and a general sense of something going &quot;whop&quot;.

David Lightman was modeled on David Scott Lewis, a hacking enthusiast Parkes and Lasker met. Falken was inspired by and named after Stephen Hawking; John Lennon was interested in playing the role, but was murdered in New York while the script was in development. General Beringer was based on General James V. Hartinger (USAF), the then-commander-in-chief of NORAD, whom Parkes and Lasker met while visiting the base, and who, like Beringer, favored keeping humans in the decision loop.

=== Filming ===
Martin Brest was originally hired as the director, but was dismissed after 12 days of shooting because of a disagreement with the producers, and replaced with John Badham. Several of the scenes shot by Brest remain in the final film. Badham said that Brest had &quot;taken a somewhat dark approach to the story and the way it was shot. It was like [Broderick and Sheedy] were doing some Nazi undercover thing, so it was my job to make it seem like they were having fun, and that it was exciting.&quot; According to Badham, Broderick and Sheedy were &quot;stiff as boards&quot; when they came onto the sound stage, having both Brest&#x27;s dark vision and the idea that they would soon be fired. Badham did 12 to 14 takes of the first shot to loosen the actors up. At one point, Badham decided to race with the two actors around the sound stage, with the one who came last having to sing a song to the crew. Badham lost and sang &quot;The Happy Wanderer&quot;, the silliest song he could think of. He invited what &quot;Wired&quot; described as &quot;a small army of computer whizzes on set&quot; to advise on accuracy.

Tom Mankiewicz says he wrote some additional scenes during shooting that were used. Walon Green was also an uncredited script doctor.

=== Design ===
The WOPR computer, as seen in the film, was a prop created in Culver City, California, by members of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees Local 44. It was designed by production designer (credited as a visual consultant) Geoffrey Kirkland on the basis of some pictures he had of early tabulating machines, and metal furniture, consoles, and cabinets used particularly in the U.S. military in the 1940s and 1950s. Art director Angelo P. Graham adapted them in drawings and concepts. The WOPR was operated by a crewmember sitting inside the computer, entering commands into an Apple II at the director&#x27;s instruction. The prop was broken up for scrap after production was completed. A replica was built for a 2006 AT&amp;T commercial.

== Release ==
&quot;WarGames&quot; did well at the box office, grossing $79,567,667, the fifth-highest of 1983 in the United States and Canada. It grossed $45 million internationally for a worldwide total of $124.6 million.

The film was screened out of competition at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;WarGames&quot; received an approval rating of 94% based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 7.60/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Part delightfully tense techno-thriller, part refreshingly unpatronizing teen drama, &quot;WarGames&quot; is one of the more inventive—and genuinely suspenseful—Cold War movies of the 1980s.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 77 out of 100 based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave &quot;WarGames&quot; four out of four stars, calling it &quot;an amazingly entertaining thriller&quot; and &quot;one of the best films so far this year&quot;, with a &quot;wonderful&quot; ending. Leonard Maltin gave it a mixed review calling it &quot;&quot;Fail Safe&quot; for the Pac-Man Generation&quot; and &quot;Entertaining to a point&quot;. He concluded, &quot;Incidentally, it&#x27;s easy to see why this was so popular with kids: most of the adults in the film are boobs.&quot;

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; stated that &quot;&quot;Wargames&quot; is plausible enough to intrigue and terrifying enough to excite ... [it] makes one think, as well as feel, all the way&quot;, raised several moral questions about technology and society, and recommended the film to &quot;Computer hobbyists of all kinds&quot;. &quot;Softline&quot; described the film as being &quot;completely original&quot;; unlike other computer-related films like &quot;Tron&quot; that &quot;could (and do) exist in substantially the same form with some other plot&quot;, &quot;WarGames&quot; &quot;could not exist if the microcomputer did not exist ... It takes the micro and telecommunications as a given—part of the middle-class American landscape&quot;. The magazine praised the film as &quot;Very funny, excruciatingly suspenseful, and endlessly inventive, this movie is right on the mark; authentic even when highly improbable&quot;. Christopher John in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; commented that &quot;The movie cloaked itself in a standard message, but then set out to take something we have seen many times before and retell it in a new, interesting fashion. &quot;War Games&quot; is highly entertaining, fast-moving, colorful, and mentally stimulating&quot;. Colin Greenland in &quot;Imagine&quot; stated that &quot;&quot;Wargames&quot; is a tense, tight film, sharply acted, funny, sane, and with a plot twist for every chilling sub-routine in WOPR&#x27;s scenarios for World War III&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
&quot;WarGames&quot; was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Cinematography (William A. Fraker), Sound (Michael J. Kohut, Carlos Delarios, Aaron Rochin, Willie D. Burton), and Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen (Lawrence Lasker, Walter F. Parkes). The company that provided the large screens used to display the tactical situations seen in the NORAD set employed a new design that was super-bright enabling the displays to be filmed live. (The set was more visually impressive than the actual NORAD facilities at the time.) The animations seen on the NORAD displays, produced by Colin Cantwell, were created using Hewlett Packard HP 9845C computers driving monochrome HP 1345A vector displays, which were still-filmed through successive color-filters. Each frame took approximately one minute to produce, and 50,000 feet of negatives were produced over seven months. The animations were projected &quot;live&quot; onto the screens from behind using 16 mm film, so they were visible to the actors and no post-production work was needed.

==== List of awards and nominations ====

=== Influence ===
&quot;WarGames&quot; was the first mass-consumed, visual media with the central theme of remote computing as well as hacking, and it served as both an amplifier vehicle and framework for America&#x27;s earliest discussion of information technology. In the wake of the film, major news media focused on the potential for the &quot;&quot;WarGames&quot; scenario&quot; to exist in reality. This focus contributed to the creation of the first U.S. federal internet policy, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.

Bulletin board system (BBS) operators reported an unusual rise in activity in 1984, which at least one sysop attributed to &quot;WarGames&quot; introducing viewers to modems. The scenes showing Lightman&#x27;s computer dialing every number in Sunnyvale led to the term &quot;War dialing&quot; (earlier known as &quot;demon dialing&quot;), a technique of using a modem to scan a list of telephone numbers in search of unknown computers, and indirectly to the newer term &quot;wardriving&quot;.

President Ronald Reagan, a family friend of Lasker&#x27;s, watched the film and discussed the plot with members of Congress, his advisers, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Reagan&#x27;s interest in the film is credited with leading to the enactment 18 months later of NSDD-145, the first Presidential directive on computer security.

== Related media ==
===Novelization===
A novelization of the film was written by David Bischoff.

=== Sequel ===

In November 2006, preproduction began on a sequel, titled &quot;WarGames: The Dead Code&quot;. It was directed by Stuart Gillard, and starred Matt Lanter as a hacker named Will Farmer facing off with a government supercomputer called RIPLEY. MGM released the sequel directly to DVD on July 29, 2008, along with the 25th Anniversary Edition DVD of &quot;WarGames&quot;. To promote the sequel, the original film returned to selected theaters as a one-night-only 25th-anniversary event on July 24, 2008.

=== Video games ===
A video game, &quot;WarGames&quot;, was released for the ColecoVision in 1983 and ported to the Atari 8-bit computers and Commodore 64 in 1984. It played similarly to the NORAD side of the &quot;Global Thermonuclear War&quot; game, where the United States had to be defended from a Soviet strike by placing bases and weapons at strategic points. &quot;&quot;, a real-time strategy game only loosely related to the film, was released for the PlayStation and PC in 1998.

A game inspired by the film, called &quot;Computer War&quot; from Thorn EMI, in which the player must track and shoot down intercontinental ballistic missiles, as well as crack a computer code, was released for the Atari 8-bit, TI-99/4A, and VIC-20 in 1984. The same year, Australian developer Gameworx released &quot;Thermonuclear Wargames&quot;, an illustrated text adventure in which the player must stop a NORDAD computer called M.A.S.T.A. from initiating World War III.

The film also inspired the Introversion game &quot;DEFCON&quot; (2006).

Be-Rad Entertainment released a tile-matching video game, &quot;WarGames: WOPR&quot;, for iOS and Android devices in 2012.

=== Interactive series ===

An interactive media reboot of &quot;WarGames&quot; was announced by MGM in 2015, with Interlude serving as its co-production company. The project was described as an &quot;audience-driven story experience&quot;, with anticipated launch in 2016. In March 2016, Sam Barlow announced he had joined Interlude and would be serving as a creative lead in the series, on the basis of his work from his video game, &quot;Her Story&quot;, which required the player to piece together a mystery based on a series of video clips. Interlude rebranded itself as Eko in December 2016, and the six-episode series was released in March 2018.

== Soundtrack ==
The film&#x27;s music was composed and conducted by Arthur B. Rubinstein. A soundtrack album including songs and dialogue excerpts was released by Polydor Records. Intrada Records issued an expanded release in 2008 with the complete score, with expanded horn sections and without the film dialogue. In 2018, Quartet Records issued a 35th anniversary expanded 2-CD edition containing the score as presented in the film, and the 1983 Polydor album on disc 2.

== Legacy ==
Critics have cited the film as an influence on Mamoru Hosoda&#x27;s 2000 short film &quot;Digimon Adventure: Our War Game!&quot;, with critic Geoffrey G. Thew, writing in &quot;Anime Impact: The Movies and Shows that Changed the World of Japanese Animation,&quot; noting that both films share a title and a plot of &quot;a rogue AI hijacking the Internet to spread chaos and potentially destroy the world, only to be stopped by some kids on their computers.&quot; Hosoda later stated that &quot;Our War Game&quot; &quot;kind of started my idea for [his 2009 film] &quot;Summer Wars&quot;,&quot; noting that &quot;Summer Wars&quot; &quot;became the feature-length version of that idea&quot; and allowed him to explore material he was unable to in &quot;Our War Game&quot;&#x27;s 40 minute runtime.

<text>Friedrich Wilhelm Ostwald (; – 4 April 1932) was a German chemist and philosopher. Ostwald is credited with being one of the founders of the field of physical chemistry, with Jacobus Henricus van &#x27;t Hoff, Walther Nernst and Svante Arrhenius.
He received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1909 for his scientific contributions to the fields of catalysis, chemical equilibria and reaction velocities.

Following his 1906 retirement from academic life, Ostwald became much involved in philosophy, art, and politics. He made significant contributions to each of these fields. He has been described as a polymath.

==Early life and education==
Ostwald was born ethnically Baltic German in Riga, Russian Empire (now Latvia) to master-cooper Gottfried Wilhelm Ostwald and Elisabeth Leuckel. He was the middle child of three, born after Eugen and before Gottfried. Ostwald developed an interest in science as a child and conducted experiments at his home, particularly related to fireworks and photography.

Ostwald entered the University of Dorpat (now the University of Tartu, Estonia) in 1872. He completed his &quot;Kandidatenschrift&quot; examinations there in 1875. During his time at Dorpat, Ostwald had significant exposure to the humanities, the arts, and philosophy, which became a focus of his endeavors after his 1906 retirement from academia.

== Academic career ==
Ostwald began his career as an independent unpaid investigator at the University of Dorpat in 1875. He worked in the laboratory of Carl Schmidt, along with his contemporary Johann Lemberg. Lemberg taught Ostwald many of the basics of the analysis of inorganic compounds and measurements of equilibria and chemical reaction rates. Lemberg also taught Ostwald the chemical basis of many geologic phenomena. These endeavors formed part of the subjects of Ostwald&#x27;s later research efforts. In addition to his work in Carl Schmidt&#x27;s laboratory, Ostwald also studied in the university&#x27;s physics institute with Arthur von Oettingen.

Around 1877, still continuing his work as an unpaid investigator in the Chemistry Laboratory at the University of Dorpat, Ostwald became a paid assistant in the Physics Institute, after Oettingen&#x27;s assistant moved to Riga. 
He also supported himself for a time by teaching mathematics and science at a Dorpat high school.

Ostwald was deeply interested in questions of chemical affinity and the reactions that formed chemical compounds. This was the central theoretical question facing chemists at the time. As part of his early work, Ostwald developed a three-dimensional affinity table that took into account the effects of temperature as well as the affinity constants of acids and bases. Ostwald also investigated mass action, electrochemistry, and chemical dynamics.

Ostwald completed his Magisterial degree at the University of Dorpat in 1877, enabling him to give lectures and charge for teaching. 
Ostwald published his doctoral dissertation at the University of Dorpat in 1878, with Carl Schmidt as his thesis advisor. His doctoral thesis was entitled &quot;Volumchemische und Optisch-Chemische Studien&quot; (&quot;Volumetric and Optical-Chemical Studies&quot;). In 1879, he became a paid assistant to Carl Schmidt.

In 1881, Ostwald became a Professor of Chemistry at the Riga Polytechnicum (now Riga Technical University). In 1887, he moved to Leipzig University where he became Professor of Physical Chemistry. Ostwald remained on the faculty at Leipzig University until his retirement in 1906. He also served as the first &quot;exchange professor&quot; at Harvard University in 1904 and 1905.

During Ostwald&#x27;s academic career, he had many research students who became accomplished scientists in their own right. These included future Nobel Laureates Svante Arrhenius, Jacobus Henricus van &#x27;t Hoff, and Walther Nernst.
Other students included Arthur Noyes, Willis Rodney Whitney and Kikunae Ikeda. All of these students became notable for their contributions to physical chemistry.

In 1901, Albert Einstein applied for a research position in Ostwald&#x27;s laboratory. This was four years before Einstein&#x27;s publication on special relativity. Ostwald rejected Einstein&#x27;s application, although later the two developed strong mutual respect. Subsequently, Ostwald nominated Einstein for the Nobel Prize in 1910 and again in 1913.

Following his 1906 retirement, Ostwald became active in philosophy, politics, and other humanities.

During the course of his academic career, Ostwald published more than 500 original research papers for the scientific literature and approximately 45 books.

== Scientific contributions ==
=== Nitric acid process ===
Ostwald invented a process for the inexpensive manufacture of nitric acid by oxidation of ammonia. He was awarded patents for this process. Ostwald&#x27;s patent made use of a catalyst and described conditions under which the yield of nitric acid was near the theoretical limit. Aspects of the basic process had also been patented some 64 years earlier by Kuhlmann. Kuhlmann&#x27;s process did not become industrially significant, likely due to the lack of an inexpensive source of ammonia. Shortly after Ostwald&#x27;s finding, inexpensive ammonia became available as a result of Haber and Bosch&#x27;s invention of a process for nitrogen fixing process (completed by 1911 or 1913) for ammonia synthesis. The combination of these two breakthroughs soon led to more economical and larger-scale production of fertilizers and explosives, of which Germany was in short supply during World War I. The process is often referred to as the Ostwald Process. The process remains in widespread use in contemporary times for manufacture of nitric acid.
=== Ostwald&#x27;s dilution law===
Ostwald also conducted significant research on dilution theory leading to his conceptualization of the law of dilution which at times is referred to as &quot;Ostwald&#x27;s Dilution Law&quot;. This theory holds that the behavior of a weak electrolyte follows the principles of mass action, being extensively dissociated at infinite dilution. This characteristic of weak electrolytes can be observed experimentally, such as by electrochemical determinations.

===Catalysis===
Through his research on chemical reaction rates and velocities and his studies of acids and bases, Ostwald found that the concentration of acid or the concentration of base in a solution of certain chemical reactants can have a strong influence of the rate of chemical processes. He realized that this is manifestation of the concept of chemical catalysis first articulated by Berzelius. Ostwald articulated the idea that a catalyst is a substance that accelerates the rate of a chemical reaction without being a part of either the reactants or the products. Ostwald&#x27;s advances in the understanding of chemical catalysis were widely applicable in biological processes such as enzymatic catalysis and also in many industrial processes. A catalyst is used in the nitric acid process that Ostwald invented.

=== Crystallization ===
Ostwald studied the crystallization behavior of solids, especially those solids that are capable of crystallizing in different forms, in the phenomenon known as polymorphism. He discovered that solids do not necessarily crystallize in their most thermodynamically stable form but instead sometimes crystallize preferentially in other forms dependent on the relative rates of crystallization of each polymorphic form. Ostwald found that the relative rates were dependent on the surface tension between the solid polymorph and the liquid form. Many common materials exhibit this type of behavior, including minerals and various organic compounds. This finding came to be known as Ostwald&#x27;s rule.

Ostwald realized that solid or liquid solutions can continue to evolve over time. While the a non-thermodynamically preferred polymorph may crystallize first, more thermodynamically stable forms can continue to develop as the solution ages. Often this results in large crystals forming, since they are more thermodynamically stable than are large numbers of small crystals. This phenomenon came to be known as Ostwald Ripening and is observed in many situations. An everyday example is the gritty texture that ice cream develops as it ages. On a geologic timescale, many minerals exhibit Ostwald Ripening as their crystal forms evolve as the mineral ages.

Related to solubility and crystallization was Ostwald&#x27;s finding that dissolution of a solid depends on the size of the crystal. When the crystals are small, typically less than a micron, the solubility of the solid in the solution phase is increased. Ostwald quantified this effect mathematically in a relationship that became known as the Ostwald-Freundlich equation. Ostwald first published his finding in 1900, and his mathematical equation was refined by German chemist Herbert Freundlich in 1909. This mathematical relationship also applies to the partial pressure of substance in the system. The Ostwald-Freundlich equation takes into account the surface tension of the particle in the system, in addition to curvature and temperature. The size dependence of solubility is sometimes utilized in the formulation of pharmaceuticals that have low solubility so as to enhance their uptake by the patient. The size dependence also has a role in Ostwald Ripening.
Collaborating with German chemist Raphael E. Liesegang, Ostwald recognized that substances can crystallize in a periodic fashion wherein the crystallization behavior follows a spatial or temporal pattern. In certain circumstances, the result of this periodic crystallization behavior is easily visually observed, for example, in various geologic formations. Liesegang had previously investigated this phenomenon in specific laboratory experiments, showing his results to Ostwald. Ostwald then developed a mathematical model for the phenomenon that served to explain the observations and realized how widespread is the periodic crystallization behavior. These observations came to be known as Liesegang rings.

===Atomic theory===

Ostwald introduced the word mole into the lexicon of chemistry around 1900. He defined one mole as the molecular weight of a substance in units of mass grams. The concept was linked to the ideal gas, according to Ostwald. Ironically, Ostwald&#x27;s development of the mole concept was directly related to his theory of energeticism, in philosophical opposition to atomic theory, against which he (along with Ernst Mach) was one of the last holdouts. He explained in a conversation with Arnold Sommerfeld that he was convinced by Jean Perrin&#x27;s experiments on Brownian motion.

In 1906 Ostwald was elected a member of the International Committee on Atomic Weights. As a consequence of World War I, this membership ended in 1917 and was not resumed after the war. The 1917 Annual Report of the committee ended with the unusual note: &quot;Because of the European war the Committee has had much difficulty in the way of correspondence. The German member, Professor Ostwald, has not been heard from in connection with this report. Possibly the censorship of letters, either in Germany or en route, has led to a miscarriage&quot;.

===Scientific measurements===
As part of Ostwald&#x27;s investigations in to chemical equilibria, chemical affinity, and acid-base interactions, he recognized that many established analytical methods disturb the chemical systems under investigation. He therefore turned to physical measurements as surrogate methods to understand these important basic phenomena. One such physical measurement is the measurement of the viscosity, or resistance to flow, of a liquid. Ostwald invented a device for this purpose consisting of bulbs that act as reservoirs for a liquid with a capillary, or thin tube, in between the reservoirs. The time that it takes for the liquid to flow through the capillary from one reservoir to the other is an indication of the viscosity of the liquid. Using a reference solution, the viscosity of the liquid can be quantified. Ostwald typically used this device to study the behavior of solutes in water solutions. These devices came to be known as Ostwald viscometers and are in widespread use in contemporary times for research and quality control purposes.

Ostwald designed a pipette that could be used to transfer and measure liquids, especially serous fluids. This design was later improved by Otto Folin. This type of pipette has a bulb at the lower end as a particular design feature. It became known as the Ostwald-Folin pipette and is widely used in contemporary times.

===Color science===
Following his 1906 retirement from academia, Ostwald became interested in the systematization of colors, which could be useful both scientifically and in the arts. He published &quot;The Color Primer&quot; and also &quot;The Color Atlas&quot; during the period of 1916–8. These publications established relationships between the various visual colors. 
Ostwald represented these as a three dimensional representation of color space that is a topological solid consisting of two cones. One apex of the cone is pure white while the other is pure black. The eight primary colors are represented along the circumference or curved surfaces of the two cones. In this representation, each color is a mixture of white, black, and the eight primary colors. In this way, there are three degrees of freedom that represent each color.
This representation of colors was an important early step toward their systematization, replacing color perception by the human eye with an objective system. Much of Ostwald&#x27;s work on systematization of color was done in collaboration with Deutscher Werkbund, which was an association of painters and architects.

==Scholarly journals and societies==
In 1887, Ostwald founded the peer-reviewed scientific journal &quot;Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie&quot;, specializing in original research in the field of physical chemistry. He served as its editor-in-chief until 1922. In 1894, Ostwald formed the German Electrochemical Society which ultimately became the Deutsche Bunsen-Gesellschaft für angewandte physikalische Chemie [German Bunsen-Society for Applied Physical Chemistry]. He created the journal &quot;Klassiker der exakten Wissenschaften&quot; in 1889, of which more than 250 volumes have been published.

As part of his interest in philosophy, in 1902 Ostwald started the journal &quot;Annalen der Naturphilosophie&quot; (Annales of Natural Philosophy). In 1927, he initiated the journal &quot;Die Farbe&quot; (Colour).

Ostwald was one of the directors of the Die Brücke institute in Munich, and he played a role in its founding in 1911. The institute was sponsored, significantly, from Ostwald&#x27;s Nobel Prize money. Through the institute, Ostwald&#x27;s intention was to develop a standardized system for scholarly publications. In 1911, Ostwald founded the Association of Chemical Societies, which sought to organize and improve the efficiency of various chemical societies. The association is an example of a scientific society. Ostwald served as the first president of the Association of Chemical Societies.

== Scholarly contributions to humanities and politics ==
In addition to his research in chemistry, Wilhelm Ostwald was productive in a broad range of fields. His published work, which includes numerous philosophical writings, contains about forty thousand pages. Ostwald was also engaged in the peace movement of Berta von Suttner.

Among his other interests, Ostwald was a passionate amateur painter who made his own pigments. He left more than 
1,000 paintings along with 3,000 pastels and color studies. For Ostwald, science and the arts were mutually supportive areas of engagement.

Ostwald regarded science and the arts as having a common aim, that of &quot;coping with the infinite diversity of appearances through the formation of appropriate concepts&quot;... Towards this aim, science builds &quot;intellectual ideas; art constructs visual ones.&quot;

Ostwald developed a strong interest in color theory in the later decades of his life. He wrote several publications in the field, such as his &quot;Malerbriefe&quot; (&quot;Letters to a Painter,&quot; 1904) and &quot;Die Farbenfibel&quot; (&quot;The Color Primer,&quot; 1916). His work in color theory was influenced by that of Albert Henry Munsell, and in turn influenced Piet Mondrian and other members of De Stijl and Paul Klee and other members of the Bauhaus school. Ostwald&#x27;s theories also influenced Americans Faber Birren and Egbert Jacobson.

He was also interested in the international language movement, first learning Esperanto, then later supporting Ido. He was a member of a Committee of the Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language. Ostwald donated half the proceedings of his 1909 Nobel prize to the Ido movement, funding the Ido magazine &quot;Progreso&quot; which he had proposed in 1908. Ostwald later went on to create his own language Weltdeutsch in a period of extreme nationalism during the First World War.

One of Ostwald&#x27;s continuing interests was unification through systematization. In particular, Ostwald perceived that energy efficiency was a unifying theme in all facets of society and culture. In political matters, Ostwald&#x27;s interest in energy efficiency extended to such political matters as the need for organization of labor.

Ostwald&#x27;s interest in unification through systematization led to his adaptation of the philosophy of Monism. Initially, Monism was liberal, pacifist, and international, seeking in science a basis of values to support social and political reforms. Ostwald himself developed a system of ethics based on science, around the core idea that one should &quot;not waste energy, but convert it into its most useful form.&quot;

in 1911, Ostwald became President of the &quot;Deutscher Monistenbund&quot; (Monist Association), founded by Ernst Haeckel. Ostwald (and other Monists) promoted eugenics and euthanasia, but only as voluntary choices with the intention of preventing suffering. Monist promotion of such ideas is suggested to have indirectly facilitated acceptance of the later Social Darwinism of the National Socialists. Ostwald died before the Nazis adopted and enforced the use of eugenics and euthanasia as involuntary government policies, to support their racist ideological positions. Ostwald&#x27;s Monism also influenced Carl G. Jung&#x27;s identification of psychological types.

==Honours and awards==

Ostwald was elected an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1905 and an International Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1906. He received the 1909 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his contributions to understanding catalysis and for his investigations of the fundamental principles underlying chemical equilibria and reaction rates. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize 20 times beginning in 1904, and he submitted nine nominations of other scientists for the Nobel Prize following his own award. This included two nominations of Albert Einstein. Ostwald donated more than US$40,000 of his Nobel Prize award money to advance the cause of the Ido language. He was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1912.

In 1923, Ostwald was awarded the Wilhelm Exner Medal, which recognized the economic impact of Ostwald&#x27;s scientific contributions.

In 1904 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He became an honorary member of scientific societies in Germany, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Russia, Great Britain, and the United States. Ostwald received honorary doctorates from various universities in Germany, Great Britain and the United States. In 1899 he was made a Geheimrat by the King of Saxony, which by that time was a recognition of Ostwald&#x27;s scholarly contributions.

There is a Wilhelm Ostwald Park and Museum in Grimma, Germany, at the site of Ostwald&#x27;s vacation home. This institution also houses many of Ostwald&#x27;s scholarly works.

Ostwald crater, which is on the far side of the Earth&#x27;s moon, was named in honor of Wilhelm Ostwald.

==Personal life==
On 24 April 1880 Ostwald married Helene von Reyher (1854–1946), with whom he had five children. These were: Grete, (1882–1960) born in Riga and died in Großbothen; Wolfgang (1883–1943) born 1883 in Riga and died in Dresden; Elisabeth (1884– 1968) born in Riga and died in Großbothen; Walter (1886–1958) born in Riga and died in Freiburg im Breisgau; and Carl Otto (1890–1958) born in Leipzig and died in Leipzig. Wolfgang Ostwald became a notable scientist in the area of colloid chemistry.

Ostwald was initiated to the Scottish Rite Masonry and became Grand Master of the Grand Lodge &quot;Zur Aufgehenden Sonne&quot; in Bayreuth.

In 1887, he moved to Leipzig where he worked for the rest of his life. At the time of his retirement, he moved to a country estate near Groβbothen, Saxony, which he named &quot;Landhaus Energie&quot;. He lived at the country estate for most of the remainder of his life.

On his religious views, Ostwald was an atheist. Ostwald died in a hospital in Leipzig on 4 April 1932, and was buried at his country estate in Großbothen, near Leipzig

== In fiction ==
Ostwald appears as a character in Joseph Skibell&#x27;s 2010 novel, &quot;A Curable Romantic&quot;.

He is also mentioned in Italo Svevo&#x27;s 1923 novel, &quot;La coscienza di Zeno&quot;, translated as &quot;Zeno&#x27;s Conscience&quot;.

<text>Wendell Lewis Willkie (born Lewis Wendell Willkie; February 18, 1892 – October 8, 1944) was an American lawyer, corporate executive and the 1940 Republican nominee for president. Willkie appealed to many convention delegates as the Republican field&#x27;s only interventionist: although the U.S. remained neutral prior to Pearl Harbor, he favored greater U.S. involvement in World War II to support Britain and other Allies. His Democratic opponent, incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt, won the 1940 election with about 55% of the popular vote and took the electoral college vote by a wide margin.

Willkie was born in Elwood, Indiana, in 1892; both his parents were lawyers, and he also became one. He served in World War I but was not sent to France until the final days of the war, and saw no action. Willkie settled in Akron, Ohio, where he was initially employed by Firestone, but left for a law firm, becoming one of the leaders of the Akron Bar Association. Much of his work was representing electric utilities, and in 1929 Willkie accepted a job in New York City as counsel for Commonwealth &amp; Southern Corporation (C&amp;S), a utility holding company. He was rapidly promoted, and became corporate president in 1933. Roosevelt was sworn in as U.S. president soon after Willkie became head of C&amp;S, and announced plans for a Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) that would supply power in competition with C&amp;S. Between 1933 and 1939, Willkie fought against the TVA before Congress, in the courts, and before the public. He was ultimately unsuccessful, but sold C&amp;S&#x27;s property for a good price, and gained public esteem.

A longtime Democratic activist, Willkie changed his party registration to Republican in late 1939. He did not run in the 1940 presidential primaries, but positioned himself as an acceptable choice for a deadlocked convention. He sought backing from uncommitted delegates, while his supporters—many youthful—enthusiastically promoted his candidacy. As German forces advanced through western Europe in 1940, many Republicans did not wish to nominate an isolationist like Robert A. Taft, or a non-interventionist like Thomas E. Dewey, and turned to Willkie, who was nominated on the sixth ballot. Willkie&#x27;s support for aid to Britain removed it as a major factor in his race against Roosevelt, and Willkie also backed the president on a peacetime draft. Both men took more isolationist positions towards the end of the race. Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term, taking 38 of the 48 states.

After the election, Willkie made two wartime foreign trips as Roosevelt&#x27;s informal envoy, and as nominal leader of the Republican Party gave the president his full support. This angered many conservatives, especially as Willkie increasingly advocated liberal or internationalist causes. Willkie ran for the Republican nomination in 1944, but bowed out after a disastrous showing in the Wisconsin primary in April. He and Roosevelt discussed the possibility of forming a liberal political party after the war, but Willkie died in October 1944 before the idea could bear fruit. Willkie is remembered for giving Roosevelt vital political assistance in 1941, which helped the president to pass Lend-Lease to send supplies to the United Kingdom and other Allied nations.

==Youth, education and World War I service==
Lewis Wendell Willkie was born in Elwood, Indiana, on February 18, 1892, the son of Henrietta (Trisch) and Herman Francis Willkie. Both of his parents were lawyers, his mother being one of the first women admitted to the Indiana bar. Willkie was the fourth of six children, all intelligent, and learned skills during the nightly debates around the dinner table that would later serve him well.

Although given the first name Lewis, Willkie was known from childhood by his middle name. Herman Willkie, who had come from Prussia with his parents at age four, was intensely involved in progressive politics, and in 1896 took his sons to a torchlight procession for Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan, who had come to Elwood during his campaign. The Willkie boys had a sidewalk fight with Republican youths, and though the Willkies won their battle, Bryan lost his to William McKinley. When Bryan ran again in 1900, he stayed overnight at the Willkie home, and the Democratic candidate for president became the first political hero for the boy who would later seek that office.

By the time Willkie reached age 14 and enrolled in Elwood High School, his parents were concerned about a lack of discipline and a slight stoop, and they sent him to Culver Military Academy for a summer in an attempt to correct both. Willkie began to shine as a student in high school, inspired by his English teacher; one classmate said that Philip &quot;Pat&quot; Bing &quot;fixed that boy up. He started preaching to Wendell to get to work and that kid went to town.&quot; Faced with a set of athletic brothers—Edward became an Olympic wrestler—Willkie joined the football team but had little success; he enjoyed the debate team more, but was several times disciplined for arguing with teachers. He was class president his final year, and president of the most prominent fraternity, but resigned from the latter when a sorority blackballed his girlfriend, Gwyneth Harry, as the daughter of immigrants.

During Willkie&#x27;s summer vacations from high school, he worked, often far from home. In 1909, aged 17, his journey took him from Aberdeen, South Dakota, where he rose from dishwasher to co-owner of a flophouse, to Yellowstone National Park, where he was fired after losing control of the horses drawing a tourist stagecoach. Back in Elwood, Herman Willkie was representing striking workers at the local tin plate factory, and in August journeyed with Wendell to Chicago in an attempt to get liberal attorney Clarence Darrow to take over the representation. They found Darrow willing, but at too high a price for the union to meet; Darrow told Wendell Willkie, &quot;there is nothing unethical in being adequately compensated for advocating a cause in which you deeply believe.&quot;

After graduation from Elwood High in January 1910, Willkie enrolled at Indiana University in Bloomington. There, he became a student rebel, chewing tobacco, reading Marx, and petitioning the faculty to add a course on socialism to the curriculum. He also involved himself in campus politics, successfully managing the campaign of future Indiana governor Paul McNutt for student office, but when Willkie ran himself, he was defeated. He graduated in June 1913, and to earn money for law school, taught high school history in Coffeyville, Kansas, coaching debaters and several sports teams. In November 1914, he left his job there for one as a lab assistant in Puerto Rico arranged by his brother Fred. Wendell Willkie&#x27;s commitment to social justice was deepened by the sight of workers suffering abuse there.

Willkie enrolled at Indiana School of Law in late 1915. He was a top student, and graduated with high honors in 1916. At the commencement ceremony, with the state supreme court present, he gave a provocative speech criticizing his school. The faculty withheld his degree, but granted it after two days of intense debate. Willkie joined his parents&#x27; law firm, but volunteered for the United States Army on April 2, 1917, the day President Woodrow Wilson asked Congress for a declaration of war against Germany. An army clerk transposed his first two names; with Willkie unwilling to invest the time to have the bureaucracy correct it, he kept his name as Wendell Lewis Willkie. Commissioned as a first lieutenant, Willkie was sent for artillery training. He arrived in France as the war was ending and did not see combat. In January 1918 he married Edith Wilk, a librarian from Rushville, Indiana; the couple had one son, Philip. In France, Willkie was assigned to defending soldiers who had slipped away for time in Paris against orders. He was recommended for promotion to captain, but was discharged in early 1919 before the paperwork went through.

==Lawyer and executive (1919–1939)==

===Akron attorney and activist===
Discharged from the army, Willkie returned to Elwood. He considered a run for Congress as a Democrat, but was advised that the district was so Republican he would be unlikely to keep the seat even if he could win it, and his chances might be better in a more urban area. Herman Willkie wanted Wendell and Robert to rejoin the family law firm, but Henrietta was opposed, feeling that opportunities in Elwood were too limited for her sons. She got her way, and in May 1919 Wendell Willkie successfully applied for a job with the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio as head of the legal office that advised workers on wills and other personal matters. He was soon bored there, and on the advice of his wife, left for a law firm despite an offer from Harvey Firestone to double his salary. Firestone told the departing lawyer that he would never amount to anything because he was a Democrat.

Willkie became active in the Akron Democratic Party, becoming prominent enough while still with Firestone to introduce the Democratic presidential nominee, Ohio Governor James M. Cox, when he came to town during the 1920 campaign. He was a delegate to the 1924 Democratic National Convention, and supported New York Governor Al Smith through the record 103 ballots, when the nomination fell to former West Virginia congressman John W. Davis. More important to Willkie, though, was a fight against the Ku Klux Klan, which had become powerful in much of the nation and in the Democratic Party, but he and other delegates were unsuccessful in their attempt to include a plank in the party platform condemning the Klan. He also backed a proposed plank in support of the League of Nations that ultimately failed. In 1925, Willkie led a successful effort to oust Klan members on the Akron school board.

After leaving Firestone in 1920, Willkie joined leading Akron law firm Mather &amp; Nesbitt, which represented several local public utilities. Although he quickly gained a reputation as a leading trial lawyer, he was especially noted for presenting utility cases before the Ohio Public Utilities Commission. In 1925, he became president of the Akron Bar Association. One of Willkie&#x27;s clients, Ohio Power &amp; Light, was owned by New York-based Commonwealth &amp; Southern Corporation (C&amp;S), whose chairman, B.C. Cobb, noticed him. Cobb wrote to the senior partner of Willkie&#x27;s firm, &quot;I think he is a comer and we should keep an eye on him.&quot; In 1929, Cobb offered Willkie a salary of $36,000 (equal to $ today) to be corporate counsel to C&amp;S, a job which would involve a move to New York, and Willkie accepted.

===Commonwealth &amp; Southern executive===
Wendell and Edith Willkie moved to New York in October 1929, only weeks before the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and found an apartment overlooking Central Park. Initially intimidated by the size and anonymity of the big city, Wendell Willkie soon learned to love it. He attended the Broadway theatre, and read through ten newspapers each day. Willkie and his wife had little in common, and grew apart through the 1930s. He acquired a social life, and met Irita Van Doren, the book review editor of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; who became a friend, and later his lover. Cultured, brilliant and well connected, Van Doren introduced him to new books, new ideas, and new circles of friends. Unlike Van Doren, Willkie was indiscreet about their relationship, and their affair was well known to the reporters covering him during his 1940 presidential campaign. None of them printed a word.

At C&amp;S, Willkie rose rapidly under the eye of Cobb, impressing his superiors. Much of his work was outside New York City; Willkie was brought in to help try important cases or aid in the preparation of major legal briefs. Cobb, a pioneer in the electricity transmission business, had presided over the 1929 merger of 165 utilities that made C&amp;S the largest electric utility holding company in the country. He promoted Willkie over 50 junior executives, designating the younger man as his successor. In January 1933, Willkie became president of C&amp;S.

Willkie maintained his interest in politics, and was a delegate to the 1932 Democratic National Convention. Since the incumbent Republican president, Herbert Hoover, was widely blamed for the Depression that had followed the stock market crash, the nominee would have a good chance of becoming president. The major candidates were Smith (the 1928 nominee), Smith&#x27;s successor as New York&#x27;s governor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Speaker of the House John Nance Garner, and former Secretary of War Newton D. Baker. Willkie backed Baker, and was an assistant floor manager for his campaign. With a two-thirds majority needed to gain the Democratic presidential nomination, Willkie and others tried to deadlock the convention in the hope that it would turn to Baker. Roosevelt was willing to swing his votes to Baker in the event of a stalemate, but this did not occur, as Governor Roosevelt gained the nomination on the fourth ballot. Willkie, although disappointed, backed Roosevelt, and donated $150 to his successful campaign.

===TVA battle===
Soon after taking office, President Roosevelt proposed legislation creating the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), a government agency with far-reaching influence that promised to bring flood control and cheap electricity to the impoverished Tennessee Valley. However, the TVA would compete with existing private power companies in the area, including C&amp;S subsidiaries. Willkie appeared before the House Military Affairs Committee on April 14, 1933. He approved of the ideas for development of the Tennessee Valley, but felt that the government role should be limited to selling power generated by dams. Although the House of Representatives passed a bill limiting the TVA&#x27;s powers, the Senate took the opposite stance, and the latter position prevailed.
Negotiations took place through the remainder of 1933 for C&amp;S to sell assets, including a transmission line, to allow the TVA to distribute energy to retail customers, leading to an agreement on January 4, 1934. TVA head David Lilienthal was impressed by Willkie, who left him &quot;somewhat overwhelmed&quot; and &quot;pretty badly scared&quot;. C&amp;S agreed to sell some of its properties in part of the Tennessee Valley, and the government agreed that the TVA would not compete with C&amp;S in many areas. In October 1934, holders of securities issued by a C&amp;S subsidiary filed suit to block the transfer. Willkie angrily denied that he had prompted the lawsuit, though plaintiffs&#x27; counsel proved later to have been paid by the Edison Electric Institute, of which Willkie was a board member. Willkie warned that New York capital might avoid Tennessee if the TVA experiment continued, and when Roosevelt gave a speech in praise of the agency, issued a statement rebutting him. By 1934, Willkie had become the spokesman for the private electric power industry.

Amid this tension, Willkie and Roosevelt met for the first time, at the White House on December 13, 1934. The meeting was outwardly cordial, but each man told his own version of what occurred: the president boasted of having outtalked Willkie, while the executive sent a soon-to-be-famous telegram to his wife: &quot;&quot;. Roosevelt decided that the utility holding companies had to be broken up, stated so in his 1935 State of the Union address, and met with Willkie later in January to inform him of his intent. In the meantime, the companies did their best to sabotage the TVA; farmers were told by corporate representatives that lines from the new Norris Dam could not carry enough power to make a light bulb glow, and the company ran &quot;spite lines&quot; that might not even carry power in an effort to invoke the non-compete agreement over broad areas.
Through 1935, as the breakup legislation wound through Congress, and litigation through the courts, Willkie was the industry&#x27;s chief spokesman and lobbyist. When the Senate narrowly passed a bill for the breakup, Willkie made a series of speeches asking the public to oppose the legislation, and a storm of letters to congressmen followed. After the House of Representatives defeated the breakup clause, investigation proved that many of these communications were funded by the electric companies, signed with names taken from the telephone book, though Willkie was not implicated. Amid public anger, Roosevelt pressured Congress to pass a bill requiring the breakup to take place within three years.

In September 1936, Roosevelt and Willkie met again at the White House, and a truce followed as both sides waited to see if Roosevelt would be re-elected over the Republican, Kansas Governor Alf Landon. Willkie, who voted for Landon, expected a narrow victory for the Republican, but Roosevelt won an overwhelming landslide as Landon won only Maine and Vermont. In December, a federal district court judge granted the C&amp;S companies an injunction against the TVA, and negotiations broke off by Roosevelt&#x27;s order as the litigation continued. Willkie took his case to the people, writing columns for major publications, and proposing terms for an agreement that &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as &quot;sensible and realistic&quot;. He received favorable press, and many invitations to speak.

The January 1938 Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes&quot;, resolving the 1934 case, and the lifting of the injunction by an appeals court, sent the parties back to the negotiating table. Willkie kept the public pressure on: like most corporate executives, he had not spoken out against Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal policies, but in January stated in a radio debate that anti-utility policies were depressing share prices, making it hard to attract investment that would help America to recover. &quot;For several years now, we have been listening to a bedtime story, telling us that the men who hold office in Washington are, by their very positions, endowed with a special virtue.&quot; &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; dubbed Willkie &quot;the man who talked back&quot;.

Willkie and Lilienthal negotiated for a year, with Willkie wanting $88 million for C&amp;S&#x27;s properties in and around the Tennessee Valley, and the TVA offering $55 million. After a final, January 1939, legal defeat for C&amp;S in the Supreme Court, the pace of the talks quickened, and on February 1, 1939, C&amp;S sold the assets to the TVA for $78.6 million. Securities and Exchange Commission chairman William O. Douglas deemed Willkie to have outsmarted Lilienthal. Though defeated in the courts, Willkie had gained national stature for driving a hard bargain for his shareholders, and was seen by some as a potential presidential candidate in 1940.

==1940 presidential election==
===Dark horse candidate===
The 1940 presidential campaign was conducted against the backdrop of World War II raging in Europe. Although the United States remained neutral, the nation—and especially the Republican Party—was deeply divided between isolationists, who felt the nation should avoid any steps that could lead America into the war, and interventionists, who felt that America&#x27;s survival depended upon helping the Allies defeat Nazi Germany. The three leading candidates for the 1940 Republican nomination were all isolationists to varying degrees: Senators Robert A. Taft of Ohio and Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan, and Thomas E. Dewey, the young (only 38 years old), &quot;gangbusting&quot; Manhattan District Attorney in New York City. Roosevelt&#x27;s popularity had declined since the 1936 landslide, but many still hoped he would run for an unprecedented third term. He had long contemplated one, but made no announcement. Roosevelt&#x27;s decision-making on this point is uncertain: as late as April 1940, he may have been thinking of retirement. If he stepped aside, possible candidates included Vice President Garner, Secretary of State Cordell Hull and Postmaster General and patronage handler James A. Farley.
On the assumption Roosevelt would not seek a third term, Willkie had been spoken of as a possible Democratic presidential candidate as early as 1937. He raised his stock considerably when on January 3, 1938, he debated Assistant Attorney General Robert H. Jackson on the radio show &quot;Town Meeting of the Air&quot;. With the topic of the debate being the cooperation between the public and private sectors, Willkie came across as a businessman with a heart, while Jackson appeared dull. A stream of positive press mentions for Willkie continued through 1938 and into 1939, culminating with a favorable cover story in &quot;Time&quot; magazine in July 1939. Willkie was initially dismissive of the many letters he received urging him to run for president, but soon changed his mind. Van Doren thought Willkie could be president, and worked to persuade her contacts. After hosting the Willkies for a weekend, &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine managing editor Russell Davenport became convinced Wendell Willkie had presidential timber; he devoted the magazine&#x27;s April 1940 issue to Willkie, and later served as his campaign manager. In that issue, Willkie wrote an article, &quot;We The People: A Foundation for a Political Platform for Recovery&quot;, urging both major parties to omit anti-business policies from their party platforms, protect individual rights, and oppose foreign aggression while supporting world trade. This piece won him applause and supporters from the press.

Willkie never had any doubt that Roosevelt would run for a third term, and that his route to the White House would have to be through the Republican Party. In late 1939 he changed his registration from Democratic to Republican, and early in 1940 announced that he would accept the Republican nomination if it were offered to him. He blamed his allegiance shift on the Roosevelt policies that he deemed anti-business. He had voted for Landon in 1936, he said, and he felt that the Democrats no longer represented the values he advocated. As he later characterized it, &quot;I did not leave my party. My party left me.&quot;

The start of the war in September 1939 alarmed Americans, but the majority thought the U.S. should not get involved. Willkie spoke often about the threat to America and the need to aid Britain and other Allies. Willkie biographer Steve Neal wrote that the war &quot;transformed Willkie from a big-business critic of the New Deal into a champion of freedom. And it gave his candidacy new purpose.&quot; Despite the chatter about Willkie, there were many who were skeptical about his chances should he seek the nomination. Kenneth F. Simpson, Republican National Committeeman from New York, initially thought the idea of a Willkie run to be silly. Indiana Senator James Eli Watson stated that he did not mind if &quot;the town whore&quot; joined the church, but she should not lead the choir the first week.

Willkie did not enter the Republican primaries, placing his hope in a deadlocked convention. His campaign was composed mostly of political amateurs. New York lawyer Orem Root Jr. (grandnephew of former Secretary of State Elihu Root) formed a network of local Willkie Clubs, which attracted a large membership among Republicans discontented with their leadership and seeking a new figure who might beat Roosevelt. He especially appealed to liberal, Eastern Establishment Republicans who saw none of the declared candidates to their liking. His rumpled suits, country-style haircut, and Indiana twang were reminiscent of ordinary midwesterners, which led to some derision as the efforts to nominate him became more obvious. Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes mocked Willkie as &quot;a simple, barefoot Wall Street lawyer&quot;. Alice Roosevelt Longworth stated that the Willkie campaign came &quot;from the grass roots of ten thousand country clubs&quot;.

His failure to enter primaries did not greatly disadvantage Willkie because most were &quot;beauty contests&quot; serving only to show voter preferences and not to elect delegates. The primaries were governed by a complex set of unwritten rules about who would enter which primary and Taft ran only in his native Ohio, where Dewey did not enter his name. Even those delegates who were pledged to support a candidate were not strongly committed: what was important to most Republicans was to field a nominee who could beat Roosevelt. The run-up to the June convention in Philadelphia coincided with Hitler&#x27;s advance in Western Europe, and delegates had second thoughts about running an isolationist, let alone a young one without national experience such as Dewey. Willkie, who had spoken out against isolationism, and who was a successful executive, was an attractive possibility. Willkie made speeches widely, including in a tour of New England that paid off with promises of support, though delegates might first support a favorite son candidate for a ballot or two. Important converts to Willkie&#x27;s cause included Minnesota Governor Harold Stassen and Massachusetts Governor Leverett Saltonstall. The move to Willkie was reflected in polls; he went from 3 to 29 percent in the seven weeks before the convention, while Dewey, the frontrunner, fell from 67 to 47 percent.

===Convention===

The 1940 Republican National Convention opened at the Philadelphia Civic Center on June 24, 1940. As the delegates assembled, they discussed the war, the candidates, and Roosevelt&#x27;s appointment of two Republican interventionists to his cabinet four days before the convention. Henry L. Stimson, Secretary of War under President Taft and Secretary of State under Hoover, was restored to the War position, and Landon&#x27;s 1936 running mate, Frank Knox, was appointed Navy Secretary. The cabinet appointments divided the Republicans, who accused Roosevelt of dirty politics.
Willkie arrived by train in Philadelphia on June 22, two days before the convention, and immediately attracted attention by walking from 30th Street Station to his hotel, answering questions from reporters and anyone else who could get close enough to be heard. Dewey, Vandenberg and Taft had large public headquarters, but Willkie&#x27;s campaign was run from clandestine rooms at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel. Root&#x27;s Willkie Clubs and other supporters bombarded the delegates with telegrams urging support for their candidate, to the annoyance of some. Key convention officials were Willkie supporters; these included House Minority Leader Joe Martin, Massachusetts&#x27; favorite son and permanent chairman of the convention. When the head of the Committee on Arrangements, Ralph Williams (deemed likely to support Taft), died just before the convention, he was succeeded by the vice chairman, Sam Pryor, a firm Willkie backer. This placed a Willkie supporter in charge of tickets for the public galleries. With noted publicist Steve Hannagan, the Willkie campaign gained tremendous momentum.

The opening night of the convention saw the keynote speech by Governor Stassen; he subsequently announced his support for Willkie and became one of the candidate&#x27;s floor managers. The second night featured a speech by the only living former president, Herbert Hoover, who hoped to stampede the convention to a third nomination. His address went almost unheard in the hall because of problems with the sound system. In the meantime, the Dewey campaign, faced with the German announcement that with France taken, Hitler&#x27;s forces would sail on Britain, did its best to stem the flow of delegates to Willkie. Negotiations among Dewey, Taft, and Vandenberg came to nothing because none would accept less than the presidential nomination. A blaze of publicity followed Willkie wherever he went, as he caucused with delegates and appeared at press conferences with supporters, including the entire Connecticut delegation. A strong minority of African Americans still supported the Republicans, and Willkie met with a group of them, urging those delegates to visit him in the White House in 1941.

Indiana Congressman Charles Halleck gave the nominating speech for Willkie on the evening of June 26, arguing that Willkie&#x27;s recent conversion to the Republican Party was no reason not to nominate him, &quot;is the Republican Party a closed corporation? Do you have to be born into it?&quot; When Halleck mentioned Willkie&#x27;s name, there were initially boos from some delegates, but they were quickly drowned out by those in the public balconies, who thunderously chanted, &quot;We want Willkie!&quot;. Pryor had cut ticket allocations to delegations that were not for Willkie, and distributed thousands of standing room passes to Willkie partisans. The vocal support for Willkie among spectators led to complaints that other campaigns had been shorted in the distribution of tickets, but provided one of the convention&#x27;s most dramatic moments.

Dewey had predicted he would have 400 of the 501 votes needed to be nominated on the first ballot and he kept nothing in reserve so that he might show momentum in future ballots. When delegates first balloted on the afternoon of June 27, he had only 360 to 189 for Taft, 105 for Willkie, and 76 for Vandenberg. On the second ballot, Dewey began to slip, falling to 338 to Taft&#x27;s 203 and 171 for Willkie. The losses greatly damaged Dewey&#x27;s campaign, because other than the trivial losses suffered in the early rounds of balloting by Warren G. Harding in 1920, no Republican candidate had ever lost support from the previous ballot and won the nomination. Dewey came under pressure from his advisors to withdraw during the dinner break that followed the second ballot, and when the convention resumed to chants of &quot;We want Willkie!&quot; from the packed galleries, Dewey continued to slip as the convention became a two-horse race between Taft and Willkie. Listening by radio from his hotel room, Willkie refused to make a deal to get support from Taft delegates in exchange for making the Ohioan his running mate, and became convinced he would lose on the fifth ballot. Dewey had planned to go to the convention and withdraw, hoping to stop Willkie by endorsing Taft, but by the time he decided this, the fifth ballot was about to begin and he could not get to the Civic Center in time. Willkie led with 429 delegates after the fifth ballot, while Taft held 377 and Dewey only 57. The large states whose votes still were not committed to one of the two leaders were Pennsylvania (Governor Arthur James was the favorite son) and Michigan, most of whose delegates stayed with Senator Vandenberg. Although Willkie had thus far refrained from making deals, to get Michigan he agreed to allow the Republican organization there to pick that state&#x27;s federal judges. The sixth ballot, held at 12:20 am on June 28, saw Taft, then Willkie take the lead. As those in the gallery continued to call for Willkie, Vandenberg released his delegates, most of whom went to Willkie. Pennsylvania also broke for him, making Willkie the Republican nominee for president on a vote that was made unanimous.
Willkie had offered the vice presidential nomination to Connecticut Governor Raymond Baldwin, a key supporter, but scuttled those plans after his advisors and Republican officials felt that a New York-Connecticut ticket would not give sufficient geographic balance. They urged Willkie to select Senator Charles McNary of Oregon instead. A lawyer, advocate of public power, and farmer, McNary was popular and respected in the West. Willkie agreed, and got Baldwin to withdraw as others persuaded McNary, who had called Willkie a tool of Wall Street after arriving in Philadelphia. The convention dutifully nominated McNary. Before departing Philadelphia, Willkie went to the Civic Center to appear before the delegates who had chosen him, becoming the first Republican nominee to speak to the convention after gaining its endorsement:

===General election campaign===

After the convention, Willkie returned to New York. When he went to the movies or play, he received a standing ovation. He resigned from C&amp;S on July 8, 1940, confident that even if he lost his presidential bid, he would not lack for work. He had Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman John Hamilton dismissed on the advice of some of his advisors, who felt Hamilton was too conservative and isolationist, though the former chairman was given the post of executive director with partial responsibility for the Willkie campaign. Congressman Martin became RNC chair. At a time when little campaigning was done until after Labor Day, Willkie left on a five-week working vacation to The Broadmoor, a resort in Colorado Springs, but found neither peace nor privacy.

Roosevelt had been surprised by the outcome of the Republican convention, having expected to oppose a conservative isolationist. The polls showed Willkie behind by only six points, and the president expected this to be a more difficult race than he had faced in his defeats of Hoover and Landon. Roosevelt felt that Willkie&#x27;s nomination would remove the war issue from the campaign. Roosevelt was nominated by the Democratic convention in Chicago in July, though he stated that because of the world crisis, he would not actively campaign, leaving that to surrogates. The fact that both major-party presidential candidates favored intervention frustrated isolationists, who considered wooing Charles Lindbergh as a third-party candidate.

Willkie formally accepted the nomination at Elwood on August 17 before a crowd of at least 150,000, the largest political gathering in U.S. history to that point. It was an extremely hot day, and Willkie, who tried to read his speech from a typed manuscript without enlargement, failed to ignite the crowd. He remained in Rushville, where he owned farmland, over the next month, trying to become more associated with his native state than with Wall Street. He gave interviews to reporters there, and his firm support of Roosevelt&#x27;s aid to the Allies led Congressman Martin and Senator McNary to support a peacetime draft despite the strident objections of many Republicans and some Democrats. Roosevelt contacted Willkie through intermediaries to ensure the Republican candidate would not make a political issue out of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement; Willkie was supportive of the transfer, though he felt Congress should act, and opposed Roosevelt sending armaments to Britain by executive order.
Conservatives and isolationists had little enthusiasm for the Willkie campaign, and the moderates wanted to see stronger positions on progressive issues and foreign policy. Publisher Henry Luce decried both Roosevelt and Willkie for failing to be honest with the American people, &quot;America will never be ready for any war &quot;until she makes her mind up there is going to be a war&quot;.&quot; (italics in original) Despite his pledge not to campaign, Roosevelt made inspection tours to military installations, well covered by the press. The president did not mention Willkie by name, seeking to avoid giving him publicity. According to Susan Dunn in her book in the 1940 campaign, this forced Willkie &quot;to box against a phantom opponent and carry on a one-sided partisan debate ... Even in Willkie&#x27;s speeches, Roosevelt occupied center stage&quot;. Willkie promised to keep New Deal social welfare programs intact, expand Social Security, and provide full employment, a job for everyone: &quot;I pledge a new world&quot;.

On September 12, Willkie began a whistle-stop tour by train, and between then and November 2, he reached 31 of the 48 states. He did not visit the Solid South, though he spoke in Texas, hoping to win it as Hoover had in 1928. Willkie filled the Los Angeles Coliseum with 70,000 middle-class supporters, but reporters saw few working-class people at his rallies, and he cancelled some appearances at auto plants in the Midwest. Other people in working-class areas booed the candidate, held up signs in support of Roosevelt, or pelted his motorcade with overripe fruit. Although Edith Willkie accompanied her husband on his tour (he had little time for contact with Van Doren), she disliked the media attention and did not give interviews, completing the campaign without ever giving a speech. On one occasion, she looked at her husband and stated, &quot;Politics makes strange bedfellows&quot;. The Democrats knew of Willkie&#x27;s affair with Van Doren, but the Republicans had letters from Henry A. Wallace, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, to his former guru, Russian mystic Nicholas Roerich, and neither issue became a factor in the campaign.

With polls released on October 6 showing Roosevelt well ahead, Willkie began to sound an isolationist theme, accusing Roosevelt of being a warmonger. Many of Willkie&#x27;s speeches to that point had been on domestic issues, but he had been advised by Martin, Hamilton, and other advisors that the war was the issue the voters really cared about. Willkie began to argue that Roosevelt would not keep the U.S. out of war, but that he would. He was given room to make this argument by the United Kingdom&#x27;s increasing success in the Battle of Britain, as it was clear a German invasion was not imminent. The polls showed voters responding positively to this new tack, and Willkie kept on this course for the remainder of the campaign. Roosevelt reacted by scheduling five speeches for the final days, in which he proposed to rebut Willkie&#x27;s &quot;falsifications&quot;. The president stated, &quot;I have said this before, but I shall say it again and again and again. Your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign war.&quot; Willkie was prone to ad lib remarks, which sometimes led to gaffes: addressing steelworkers, he pledged to appoint a new Secretary of Labor, &quot;and it will not be a woman either&quot;. This allusion to Secretary Frances Perkins, the only woman to hold a cabinet position in American history to that point, did not aid him among female voters.
Willkie concluded his campaign on November 2 with a large rally at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden. Polls showed him four points behind Roosevelt, but with a trend towards the Republicans. Many pundits expected a tight race. On Election Day, November 5, 1940, the returns were initially encouraging, but quickly turned against Willkie. By 11 pm, radio commentators were reporting that Roosevelt had won a third term. Willkie received 45 percent of the popular vote to Roosevelt&#x27;s 55 percent. The president received 27.2 million votes to Willkie&#x27;s 22.3 million, and won 449 to 82 in the Electoral College. Willkie won 10 states to the president&#x27;s 38 though he did better than Hoover and Landon had against Roosevelt. Willkie&#x27;s popular vote total of 22,348,480 set a record for a Republican not broken until Eisenhower in 1952.

The endorsement of CIO head John L. Lewis probably gave Willkie Michigan, and he gained ground in the suburbs and rural areas, but Roosevelt consolidated his 1936 coalition of working-class Americans, ethnics, and white Southerners to take the election. On the evening of November 11, Willkie gave a nationwide radio address, urging those who had voted for him not to oppose Roosevelt on all issues, but to give support where it was called for. In late November, Willkie interrupted a Florida vacation for a speech he concluded by offering a toast &quot;to the health and happiness of the President of the United States&quot;; Roosevelt confided to his son James: &quot;I&#x27;m happy I&#x27;ve won, but I&#x27;m sorry Wendell lost&quot;.

==Activist and statesman (1940–1943)==

=== Visit to the United Kingdom ===

Although defeated in the election, Willkie had become a major figure on the public scene, and at age 48, was deemed likely to remain one for years to come. Landon had received some 6,000 letters commiserating with him in his defeat; Willkie received over 100,000. Financially independent, he was in no hurry to decide among the many offers of employment from top law firms and major corporations. He resumed his affair with Van Doren.

While on vacation, Willkie decided his next cause should be military aid to embattled Britain, and announced support of the president&#x27;s Lend-Lease program on January 13, 1941. Lend-Lease was highly unpopular in the Republican Party, and Willkie&#x27;s announcement created a firestorm, with Landon and Taft decrying his actions. Former RNC chairman Hamilton wrote that of the almost 200 Republican members of the House and Senate, &quot;Willkie couldn&#x27;t dig up ten friends if his life depended on it.&quot;

Roosevelt, both appreciating Willkie&#x27;s talents, and seeking to divide and conquer his opposition, had been mulling over ways his former opponent might be of use. The president&#x27;s onetime advisor, Justice Felix Frankfurter, had suggested that Willkie should travel across the Atlantic to demonstrate bipartisan support of Britain. Willkie had already been planning a visit in support for Britain. Roosevelt believed that the visit of the nominal head of the opposition party would be far more effective in demonstrating American support than sending one of his advisors.

Willkie visited the president at the White House for the first time as an ally on January 19, 1941, the evening before Roosevelt&#x27;s third swearing-in. The president asked Willkie to be his informal personal representative to Britain, and Willkie accepted. Eleanor Roosevelt recorded that family members and White House staff found excuses to observe Willkie, and she would have done so herself had she been aware of the visit as it was happening. Roosevelt urged Willkie to see W. Averell Harriman and Harry Hopkins, both in London on missions from Roosevelt, and gave his former rival a letter to be hand-delivered to the British prime minister, Winston Churchill. At this time it was not routine for politicians to travel abroad; McNary, with considerable influence in foreign affairs, had never left North America. Thus, there was much public attention to Willkie&#x27;s mission. He departed from New York Municipal Field for London on January 22.

Upon arrival, Willkie told the press, &quot;I want to do all I can to get the United States to give England the utmost aid possible in her struggle&quot;. Willkie saw the damage Nazi bombing had inflicted on Britain, visiting bombed-out sites in London, Birmingham, Coventry, Manchester and Liverpool. In London during the Blitz, he walked the streets at night without helmet or gas mask (until Churchill gave him some), visiting bomb shelters. Churchill hosted Willkie at an official luncheon at 10 Downing Street and had him as a guest at Chequers. In his writings, Churchill recalled &quot;a long talk with this most able and forceful man&quot;.

Although it was cut short by Roosevelt&#x27;s desire to have him testify before Congress on Lend-Lease, Willkie&#x27;s visit to Britain was deemed a triumph. Willkie also went to Ireland, hoping to persuade Éamon de Valera to abandon neutrality, but his urging was unavailing. Willkie left London for Washington on February 5; because of the risk of being shot down by Nazi aircraft, the roundabout journey home took four days. He testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 11, and his support was key to passing Lend-Lease.

Willkie&#x27;s Senate testimony made him the leading interventionist outside the government, with Lindbergh (who had testified against Lend-Lease) the leading isolationist, and they debated in the pages of magazines. Roosevelt weighed in, backing his former opponent in a radio address on March 29. &quot;The leader of the Republican Party himself—Mr. Wendell Willkie—in word and in action is showing what patriotic Americans mean by rising above partisanship and rallying to the common cause.&quot; That same month, a Gallup poll showed that 60 percent of Americans believed Willkie would have made a good president.

In April 1941, Willkie joined the New York law firm of Miller, Boston, and Owen as a senior partner, with the firm changing its name to Willkie, Owen, Otis, Farr, and Gallagher. Two months later, he agreed to represent motion picture producers before a Senate subcommittee which was investigating claims that Hollywood was producing pro-war propaganda. Willkie defended the rights of the studios to make films that reflected their views, and warned, &quot;the rights of the individuals mean nothing if freedom of speech and freedom of the press are destroyed.&quot; Congress took no further action.

In late 1941, Willkie fought for the repeal of the Neutrality Act. In September, Lindbergh accused American Jews of &quot;agitating for war&quot;; Willkie responded that the aviator&#x27;s speech was &quot;the most un-American made in my time&quot;. Willkie lobbied Republican congressmen to repeal the act. The measure passed Congress with the aid of Republican votes, though most of that party voted against it. Roosevelt invited Willkie to dedicate Mount Rushmore, but because of other commitments, Willkie could not. Roosevelt also sought to have Willkie join his administration, which the Republican was reluctant to do, wishing to preserve independence of word and action.

===Wartime advocate===

After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Willkie offered his full support to Roosevelt. Willkie was interested in the post of war production czar, but that position went to Donald M. Nelson. Labor Secretary Perkins offered to have Willkie arbitrate between management and labor in war industries, but Willkie declined after White House officials informed the press. In early 1942, Willkie considered a run for Governor of New York. He later stated that Roosevelt had been willing to endorse him, but Willkie ultimately concluded that the Dewey forces were too strong and a defeat might eliminate him from a possible run for president in 1944. In July, Willkie proposed to Roosevelt that he go on another foreign mission, and the following month Willkie announced that he would be visiting the Soviet Union, China, and the Middle East. Dewey wrote, &quot;I hear he is going to Russia before the Republican [state] convention, so he will be where he belongs and I hope he stays there until Christmas&quot;.

According to Dunn, Willkie&#x27;s mission was to be Roosevelt&#x27;s personal representative, &quot;demonstrating American unity, gathering information, and discussing with key heads of state plans for the postwar future&quot;. After leaving the U.S. on August 26, Willkie&#x27;s first stop was in North Africa, where he met General Montgomery and toured the front at El Alamein. In Beirut, he stayed with General de Gaulle, leader of the Free French. In Jerusalem, Willkie met with Jews and Arabs, told the British rulers of Palestine that both peoples should be brought into the government, and he later wrote that the conflict there was so ancient, it was unrealistic to think that it could &quot;be solved by good will and simple honesty&quot;. Willkie had been moved to add the Soviet Union to his itinerary when three Western reporters there urged him by telegram to do so. There, he met with Stalin, and upon his return he advocated more liberal Lend-Lease terms for the USSR. In China, Willkie was hosted by Chiang Kai-shek and was deeply fascinated by Madame Chiang. Willkie was taken to the front in order to observe the Chinese military forces in their fight against the Japanese, and he spoke out against colonialism, in China and elsewhere. His statements were reported widely in Britain, angering Churchill, who responded by saying, &quot;We mean to hold our own. I have not become the King&#x27;s First Minister in order to preside over the liquidation of the British Empire.&quot;

While in the USSR, Willkie urged the opening of a second front against the Germans; when reporters asked Roosevelt about those comments, the president responded flippantly by saying that he had read the headlines but had not considered the speculative comments worth the reading. This angered Willkie, and on his return from his 49-day trip, he confronted Roosevelt about it when making his report at the White House.

=== The Willkie moment ===
On October 26, 1942, Willkie made a &quot;Report to the People&quot;, telling Americans about his trip in a radio speech heard by about 36 million people. The following April, he published &quot;One World&quot;, a book Van Doren edited, in which he recounted his travels and urged America to join a supernational global organization after the war was successfully concluded. The book was an immediate bestseller, selling a million copies in its first month. It was especially influential because Willkie was seen by many as having transcended partisan politics. According to &quot;The Idealist&quot;, Willkie was interested in creating &#x27;a body of public opinion&#x27; to force policymakers and politicians of both parties to embrace the robust multilateralism he envisioned.

This period of time, between Willkie&#x27;s trip in 1942 and his abrupt death in 1944, was coined the &quot;Willkie moment&quot; by historian Samuel Zipp and represented the &quot;high point for American visions of war time internationalism.&quot; According to Zipp, Willkie&#x27;s moment revived the earlier &quot;Wilsonian moment,&quot; a period marked by European support for President Wilson&#x27;s idealist foreign policy in the aftermath of WW1, and expanded its terms by emphasizing the vast networks of connectivity between different nations. Zipp argues that this &quot;Willkie moment&quot; was characterized by Willkie&#x27;s three imagined geographies of the world. The first was &quot;titular universalism,&quot; or the idea that the new modes of travel and communication were rapidly shrinking borders and encouraging international collaboration and decolonization. The second geography reframed the true global conflict as not about freedom versus fascism but racism versus empire, thus challenging the morality of both European colonialism and American segregation. Willkie&#x27;s call to put an end to &quot;our imperialisms at home&quot; in &quot;One World&quot; was the first time that many Americans had heard such a public figure cast doubt on US domestic policy around race. Despite his optimistic outlook on a future defined by international collaboration and racial equality, Zipp contends that Willkie&#x27;s third geography was one of &quot;empire obscured.&quot;

===Civil rights activism===
During his 1940 campaign, Willkie had pledged to integrate the civil service and armed forces, and proudly pointed to what he deemed the strongest civil rights plank in history in the Republican platform. He also promised to end racial segregation in Washington, D.C. He gained the endorsements of the two largest African American newspapers, the &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot; and the &quot;Baltimore Afro-American&quot;. With Willkie running to the left of Roosevelt on civil rights, Roosevelt feared that blacks would return to their traditional home in the Republican Party, and he secured several prominent promotions or hirings of African Americans. Roosevelt was successful in keeping the majority of the black vote. After the election, Willkie promised to keep fighting for civil rights.

Willkie warned Republicans that only a full commitment to equal rights for minorities would woo African Americans back to the party, and he criticized Roosevelt for yielding to Southern racists among the Democrats. Willkie addressed a convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1942, one of the most prominent politicians to do so up to that point. He urged integration of the armed forces, and when a violent race riot broke out in Detroit in June 1943, he went on national radio in order to criticize both parties for ignoring racial issues. When the movie hearings of 1941 ended without further action, Willkie had been made chairman of the board of Twentieth-Century Fox. In 1943, he worked with Walter White, executive secretary of the NAACP, to try to convince Hollywood to give blacks better treatment in films. Movie moguls promised changes, and some films featured blacks in major roles, but faced with objections from white Southerners, they reverted to giving blacks stereotyped roles after Willkie&#x27;s death in 1944, such as servants. After his death, the NAACP named its headquarters the Wendell Willkie Memorial Building.

On November 9, 1942, soon after making his reports to Roosevelt and the American people, Willkie argued the case of &quot;Schneiderman v. United States&quot; before the Supreme Court. William Schneiderman, secretary of the California Communist Party, was a naturalized American until the government revoked his citizenship, stating that he had concealed his membership on his application for naturalization in 1927. Two lower federal courts upheld the denaturalization. Representing a communist, even in wartime, did nothing to shore up Willkie&#x27;s diminishing support in the Republican Party, but he wrote to a friend saying, &quot;I am sure I am right in representing Schneiderman. Of all the times when civil liberties should be defended, it is now.&quot; In his argument Willkie quoted Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson by saying that the people could, if they deemed it necessary, remake the government, and he stated that Marx&#x27;s view of revolution was mild by comparison. In 1943, the Supreme Court ruled for Schneiderman, 5–3, restoring his citizenship. Although Willkie refrained from criticizing Roosevelt&#x27;s internment of Japanese Americans, he stated in a speech that war was no excuse for depriving groups of people of their rights. He spoke out against those who blamed the Jews for the war, warning against &quot;witch-hanging and mob-baiting&quot;. For his activities, he received the American Hebrew Medal for 1942.

==1944 presidential campaign==

Willkie spent much of 1943 preparing for a second presidential run, addressing Republican and nonpartisan groups. He did not meet with Roosevelt; with the presidential election approaching and with both men likely to run in it as candidates, their continued association would have been awkward. Although they differed with him on many issues, Republican leaders recognized Willkie&#x27;s appeal and they had wanted him to campaign for the party in the 1942 midterm elections, but he went around the world instead. The huge publicity received by the titular head of the Republican Party as an emissary for a Democratic president frustrated leading Republicans. In 1942, the Republicans gained seats in both the House and the Senate. Though they still remained in the minority, they formed a Conservative coalition with Southern Democrats that took control of domestic issues in Congress. Few Republican members of Congress were by then willing to support Willkie, and he dropped to second place behind General Douglas MacArthur in polls of likely voters in the party&#x27;s 1944 presidential primaries. By 1943, even liberal Democrats did not doubt Willkie&#x27;s progressive credentials. He spoke of appointing an African American to either the cabinet or the Supreme Court, and he warned California&#x27;s Republican committee that the New Deal was irreversible and he stated that all they would get by opposing it was oblivion.

Willkie made his candidacy clear in an interview with &quot;Look&quot; magazine in early October 1943, arguing that a return to isolationism would lead the party to disaster. He decided to enter several presidential primaries in order to demonstrate his public support of the party, and he chose Wisconsin, with a primary on April 4, 1944, as the first major test. Willkie had not taken Wisconsin&#x27;s electoral votes in 1940, though he had won in all parts of the state except Milwaukee. His advisors feared the large German-American vote in Wisconsin, which had contributed to the state being firmly isolationist until Pearl Harbor. None of the other major candidates—Dewey, Stassen, MacArthur and Ohio Governor John Bricker—spoke in Wisconsin; MacArthur and Stassen were on active duty and could not do so. Willkie stated that if he did badly in Wisconsin, he would end his campaign.

The New Hampshire primary had not taken on the significance it later would, and Willkie won it on March 14, taking six out of eleven delegates. This was deemed a disappointment because he had spoken there many times since 1940, and was expected to do better. In Wisconsin, Willkie ran a slate of delegates led by future governor Vernon W. Thomson, and he devoted two weeks to campaigning there. He was endorsed by most newspapers, but polls showed him well behind Dewey both in the state and nationwide.

On March 16, his first day of campaigning in Wisconsin, Willkie made eight speeches, and the pace took a toll on his voice. The weather did not cooperate, and he travelled through a blizzard to reach a rally in the northern part of the state. Willkie attracted large crowds in most places, and he told them that the Republican party would fail unless it accepted the New Deal and recognized the need for the U.S. to remain active in the world after the war. The Democrats, he alleged, had been in office too long and they did not have the vision that was needed in the postwar world. Willkie&#x27;s speech in Milwaukee attracted 4,000 people to a hall that could hold 6,000, and he left the state on the 29th for Nebraska, where he had also entered the primary. Once he was gone, Dewey&#x27;s backers, including most of the Wisconsin Republican leadership, flooded the state with billboard advertisements and radio commercials. On April 4, Dewey gained 17 of Wisconsin&#x27;s 24 delegates, Stassen 4, and MacArthur 3. Willkie&#x27;s delegates ran last in every district. The following night, after giving his speech in Omaha, Willkie addressed the crowd:

==Final months and death==
Defeated in his second bid for the White House, Willkie announced that he was returning to the practice of law, but his friends doubted that he would be content there. Roosevelt was anxious to dump Vice President Wallace from the ticket in his bid for a fourth term, and he had an intermediary sound out Willkie about running in Wallace&#x27;s place. Willkie was reluctant even to respond, knowing that Roosevelt had made promises to potential running mates which he did not follow through on. There were further discussions between Willkie and the White House, of which third parties were aware though the details are not known; the vice presidential nomination went to Harry S. Truman. Willkie got Roosevelt interested in a new liberal party which would be formed once peace came that would combine the left of the two existing major parties, but Willkie broke off contact with the White House after there were leaks of this to the press, because he felt that Roosevelt had used him for political gain. Roosevelt sent a letter expressing his regret for the leak, but that too was printed in the papers, and Willkie stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve been lied to for the last time.&quot;

In spite of their breach, Roosevelt continued to try to conciliate Willkie. Roosevelt&#x27;s son Elliott later stated that his father hoped to have Willkie be the first Secretary General of the United Nations, and the two men agreed to meet later in the year. Willkie had not been invited to speak at the 1944 Republican National Convention in Chicago that nominated Dewey for president, and he declined a pass as an &quot;honored guest&quot;. Dewey hoped to get Willkie&#x27;s endorsement, and he sent his foreign policy advisor, John Foster Dulles, to see Willkie. The former candidate refused to be drawn, and he made no endorsement before he died. Willkie wrote two articles for &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, one urging an internationalist foreign policy, and the other demanding advances in civil rights for African Americans. He also explored becoming a newspaper publisher.

Willkie had long been neglectful of his health and diet, smoking heavily and rarely exercising. His heavy drinking had charmed the reporters in Philadelphia in 1940, but by 1944 it was becoming a problem. In August 1944, Willkie felt weak while traveling by train to his Rushville home. There, he suffered a heart attack, but he had to be persuaded to see a doctor and he refused to be admitted to a hospital.

Willkie&#x27;s condition only worsened as the weeks went on. He went to New York by rail in mid-September, but on the trip he was stricken with another heart attack. Although his advisors told him to seek treatment and abandon the trip, Willkie pressed on. When he arrived in New York, Willkie was in great pain and his press secretary called an ambulance to take him to Lenox Hill Hospital. He recovered to some extent, enough so that his friends expected him to be discharged. He spent time working on the galleys of his second book, &quot;An American Program&quot;, and planned future projects. On October 4, Willkie caught a throat infection, which was treated with penicillin. As he was recovering, Willkie&#x27;s now chronic heart attacks struck again and he suffered three more attacks on October 7. The hospital, which had been issuing reassuring bulletins to the public, was now forced to inform the public that Willkie&#x27;s condition had worsened and that he was critically ill. The next morning, Willkie suffered one last attack, which proved fatal. He had suffered over a dozen heart attacks in Lenox Hill Hospital.

Roosevelt released a statement applauding Willkie&#x27;s &quot;tremendous courage&quot; which &quot;prompted him more than once to stand alone ... In this hour of grave crisis the nation loses a great citizen.&quot; War Secretary Stimson offered to have Willkie buried in Arlington National Cemetery, but Edith Willkie wanted her husband to be buried in his native Indiana, at Rushville. His casket was placed in the center aisle of the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church; 60,000 people filed by his casket, and 35,000 crowded around the church during the service, including many blacks—as, Eleanor Roosevelt noted in her column, was fitting. Wendell and Edith Willkie rest together in Rushville&#x27;s East Hill Cemetery, the gravesite was marked by a cross, and a book was carved in stone, designed by sculptor Malvina Hoffman, and inscribed with quotations from &quot;One World&quot;.

==Legacy and remembrance==

Soon after the 1940 convention, Roosevelt described Willkie&#x27;s nomination as a &quot;Godsend to our country&quot;, because it ensured that the presidential race would not turn on the issue of aid to Britain. Walter Lippmann believed Willkie&#x27;s nomination to have been crucial to Britain&#x27;s survival, &quot;second only to the Battle of Britain, the sudden rise and nomination of Willkie was the decisive event, perhaps providential, which made it possible to rally the free world when [Britain] was almost conquered. Under any other leadership but his the Republican party in 1940 would have turned its back on Great Britain, causing all who resisted Hitler to feel abandoned&quot;. Charles Peters wrote that &quot;it is arguable that [Willkie&#x27;s] impact on [the United States] and the world was greater than that of most men who actually held the office [of president]. At a crucial moment in history, he stood for the right things at the right time.&quot; When Georgia Senator Zell Miller, a Democrat, gave the keynote address at the 2004 Republican National Convention, he urged unity instead of partisan strife in the War on Terror, and recalled Willkie&#x27;s actions, &quot;He gave Roosevelt the critical support he needed for a peacetime draft, an unpopular idea at the time. And he made it clear that he would rather lose the election than make national security a partisan campaign issue.&quot;

Historian Hugh Ross argued that in gaining the nomination, Willkie &quot;gave exceptional promise of being a winner. There were ample precedents from American political history in which a minority party, queasy over prospects for survival, bypassed professional leadership in order to entrust its political fortunes to a man without political experience. In most of the previous instances, the nomination had gone to a military man. In 1940, it went to a businessman.&quot; Richard Moe, in his book on the 1940 election, suggested that the nomination of Willkie left long-lasting scars on the Republican Party, with conservatives angered by the success of its Eastern Establishment wing; &quot;whatever else it did, Philadelphia gave birth to the bitter proprietary division within the Republican Party, one accentuated by ideology and geography, that would define the party for decades to come.&quot; Among those converted from isolationism by Willkie&#x27;s oratory, and who worked intensely on the Willkie campaign in Michigan, was Gerald R. Ford, who wrote many years later in his memoirs, &quot;I now realize that my participation did not make much difference at all to the political fate of Wendell Willkie. But it made a lot of difference to me.&quot;

Correspondent and author Warren Moscow wrote that after 1940, Willkie helped Roosevelt, who was always careful not to go too far in front of public opinion, &quot;as a pace-setter with the President&#x27;s blessing&quot;. Willkie&#x27;s global trip and the publication of &quot;One World&quot; increased public support for the idea that the United States should remain active internationally once the war was won, and should not withdraw into a new isolationism. Indiana University president Herman B Wells noted that &quot;One World&quot; &quot;has had such a profound influence on the thinking of Americans&quot;. Historian Samuel Zipp noted, &quot;He launched the most successful and unprecedented challenge to conventional nationalism in modern American history ... He urged [Americans] to imagine and feel a new form of reciprocity with the world, one that millions of Americans responded to with unprecedented urgency.&quot;

His advocacy came at a cost to his standing in the Republican Party. According to Moscow, &quot;his appeal for the party to be the party of the Loyal Opposition, supporting the President, was treason to the diehards; his trip around the world marked him as a Presidential agent seeking to infiltrate the Republican Party&quot;. This decline was accelerated as it became apparent that Willkie was a liberal, standing to the left of Roosevelt and proposing even higher taxes than the president was willing to stomach.

The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.

In 1965, Indiana University completed Willkie Quadrangle, an 11-story undergraduate residence hall, on the Bloomington campus that was named after Willkie.

In 1992, the United States Postal Service marked the centennial of Willkie&#x27;s birth with a 75-cent stamp in the Great Americans series. Dunn concluded that Willkie &quot;died as he had lived, an idealist, a humanitarian—and a lone wolf&quot;. Willkie&#x27;s biographer, Neal, wrote of him,

<doc id="34137" wikidata="Q1358492" url="?curid=34137" title="XFL (2001)">
<text>The XFL was a professional American football league that played its only season in 2001. The XFL was operated as a joint venture between the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) and NBC. The XFL was conceived as an outdoor football league that would begin play immediately after the National Football League (NFL) season ended, to take advantage of the perceived lingering public desire to watch football after the NFL and college football seasons conclude. It was promoted as having fewer rules to encourage rougher play than other major leagues, while its telecasts featured sports entertainment elements inspired by professional wrestling (and in particular, the WWF&#x27;s then-current &quot;Attitude Era&quot;), including heat and kayfabe, and suggestively-dressed cheerleaders. Commentary crews also featured WWF commentators (such as Jesse Ventura, Jim Ross, and Jerry Lawler) joined by sportscasters and veteran football players. Despite the wrestling influence, the games and their outcomes were legitimate and not based on scripted storylines.

The XFL operated as a single entity with all teams owned by the league, in contrast to most major professional leagues, which use a franchise model with individual owners. The league had eight teams in two divisions, and each franchise was based in a market that either currently had an NFL team (New York/New Jersey, Chicago, San Francisco); had previously supported other pro leagues like the United States Football League, the original World League, or the Canadian Football League (Memphis, Orlando, Birmingham, Las Vegas); or was the largest market without a professional franchise (Los Angeles). Co-owner NBC served as the main carrier of XFL games, with UPN and TNN also carrying selected games.

The first night of play brought higher television viewership than NBC had projected, but ratings exponentially plummeted for subsequent games, with criticism directed toward its overall quality of play, on-air presentation and connection to the WWF, prompting NBC to pull out of the venture after one season. While plans were made to continue without NBC (with plans for expansion teams as well), UPN allegedly made inordinate demands of the league, which hastened its demise. The league ceased operations entirely in May 2001. Its closure was announced just a few weeks after the league&#x27;s season championship game, in which the Los Angeles Xtreme defeated the San Francisco Demons, on April 21, 2001, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

Despite its short-lived existence, the XFL did pioneer several on-air technologies that would later become commonplace in football telecasts, such as aerial skycams, and on-player microphones. WWE owner Vince McMahon maintained control of the XFL brand after the league ceased operations, despite many, including McMahon himself, considering the original league to be a &quot;colossal failure.&quot; Interest in the league was revived when ESPN Films released a &quot;30 for 30&quot; documentary surrounding the league, and shortly after the film debuted, McMahon began preparing for a new iteration of the league in 2020. The new XFL was run by a new McMahon-controlled company independent from the present-day WWE, and did not utilize the sports entertainment elements featured in the previous incarnation. The second iteration of the XFL&#x27;s inaugural season was aborted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the league suspended operations and filed for bankruptcy in April 2020, with McMahon relinquishing the XFL brand in a sale to his former WWE wrestler Dwayne Johnson and Dany Garcia that August.

==Founding==
Created as a 50–50 joint venture between NBC and WWE-owned subsidiary WWE Properties International, Inc. under the company name &quot;XFL, LLC&quot;, the XFL was created as a &quot;single-entity league;&quot; instead of the franchise model used by the NFL and other major leagues, or the hybrid model where investors in the league are given operations over teams (as used in Major League Soccer), the XFL uniformly owned and operated all of its teams as one corporation, with no individual owners. Vince McMahon&#x27;s original plan was to purchase the Canadian Football League (after the CFL initially approached him about purchasing the Toronto Argonauts) and &quot;have it migrate south,&quot; which was quickly rejected by the CFL.

NBC had lost their broadcast rights to the NFL&#x27;s American Football Conference (AFC) to CBS in 1998, ending a business relationship that had its origins with the AFC&#x27;s predecessor, the American Football League (this having also come about after NBC had previously lost the rights to the pre-merger NFL, also to CBS). Prior to McMahon&#x27;s announcement, NBC was moving ahead with Time Warner to create a football league of their own.

The concept of the league was first announced on February 3, 2000. The XFL was originally conceived to build on the success of the NFL and professional wrestling. It combined the traditional game of American football with the kayfabe and stunts of professional wrestling. As WWF was, at the time, in the midst of its &quot;Attitude Era&quot; (which marked a shift in a mature and provocative direction for its content), the XFL&#x27;s presentation likewise would reflect that approach toward football. It was hyped as &quot;real&quot; football without penalties for roughness and with fewer rules in general. Keen to avoid any perception that XFL games would somehow be predetermined in the sort of manner long established in professional wrestling, McMahon repeatedly emphasized that whereas the WWF was &quot;100% (scripted) entertainment&quot; the XFL would be &quot;100% sport&quot; i.e. the winners of its games would be determined on the field. XFL games were to feature players and coaches with microphones and cameras in the huddle and in the locker rooms. Stadiums featured trash-talking public address announcers and scantily-clad cheerleaders who were encouraged to date the players. Instead of a pre-game coin toss, XFL officials put the ball on the ground and let a player from each team scramble for it to determine who received the kickoff option. The practice was dubbed &quot;The Human Coin Toss&quot; by commentators, and one player (Orlando Rage defensive back Hassan Shamsid-Deen) famously separated his shoulder on the first scramble, missing the rest of the season.

The XFL featured extensive television coverage, with three games televised each week on NBC, UPN, and TNN. To accommodate this, it placed four of its teams in the four largest U.S. media markets: New York City/North Jersey, Chicago, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Greater Los Angeles (this was during the NFL&#x27;s 21-year absence from the Los Angeles metro area). The remaining four teams were placed in markets that had previously hosted teams in second-tier and/or rival major leagues: Birmingham, Memphis, Las Vegas, and Orlando. All of the XFL&#x27;s markets except Las Vegas had hosted teams in the United States Football League in the 1980s; Las Vegas, along with Birmingham and Memphis, had hosted short-lived CFL teams in the 1990s.

The XFL chose unusual names for its teams, most of which either referenced images of uncontrolled insanity (Maniax, Rage, Xtreme, Demons) or criminal activity (Enforcers, Hitmen, Outlaws, and the Birmingham Blast). After outrage from Birmingham residents who noted that Birmingham had a history of notorious &quot;blasts&quot;, including the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in 1963 and Eric Rudolph&#x27;s 1998 bombing of a local abortion clinic, the XFL changed the name of the Birmingham team to the more benign &quot;Birmingham Thunderbolts&quot; (later shortened to &quot;Bolts&quot;).

Contrary to popular belief, the &quot;X&quot; in XFL did not stand for &quot;extreme&quot;, as in &quot;eXtreme Football League&quot;. When the league was first organized in 1999, it was originally supposed to stand for &quot;Xtreme Football League&quot;; however, there was already a league in formation at the same time with that name, and so promoters wanted to make sure that everyone knew that the &quot;X&quot; did not actually stand for anything (though McMahon would comment that &quot;if the NFL stood for the &#x27;No Fun League&#x27;, the XFL will stand for the &#x27;extra fun league&#x27;&quot;). The other Xtreme Football League, which was also organized in 1999, merged with the Arena Football League&#x27;s minor league AF2 before ever playing a single game. In a much later article describing the origins of the league&#x27;s name, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; stated: &quot;The F and the L act to indicate, if only indirectly, a football league. But the X is a variable. It could mean anything.&quot;

==Draft==
The only main draft for the league took place over a three-day period from October 28 to 30, 2000. A total of 475 players were selected initially, with 65 additional players then selected in a supplemental draft on December 29, 2000.

==Teams==

Eastern Division
* Birmingham Thunderbolts
* Chicago Enforcers
* New York/New Jersey Hitmen
* Orlando Rage

Western Division
* Las Vegas Outlaws
* Los Angeles Xtreme
* Memphis Maniax
* San Francisco Demons

==2001 season==
===On the field===
The XFL&#x27;s opening game took place on February 3, 2001, one year after the league was announced, less than one week following the NFL&#x27;s Super Bowl XXXV. The first game was between the New York/New Jersey Hitmen and the Las Vegas Outlaws at Sam Boyd Stadium in Whitney, Nevada.

The league&#x27;s regular season structure was set up so that each team played teams in its own division twice in the season, home and away (the same as the National Football League) and played against teams in the other division once. The season ran ten weeks, with no bye weeks.

The league&#x27;s western division was far more competitive than the east, with the four teams&#x27; records ranging from 7–3 (for eventual champion Los Angeles) to 4–6 (Las Vegas, who finished last after losing its last three games to end up one game out of a playoff spot). In the East, New York and Chicago both were hampered by slow starts and ineffective starters before making personnel changes that improved their play, while Orlando, under quarterback Jeff Brohm, who owned the league&#x27;s highest QB rating at 99.9 during the 2001 XFL season, soared to first place, winning its first six games before Brohm suffered a career-ending injury and the team regressed (the team went 2–2 in his absence). Birmingham started the season 2–1 before a rash of injuries (and tougher competition, as its two wins were against New York and Chicago) led to the team losing the last seven games. Injuries were a major problem across the league: only three of the league&#x27;s eight Opening Day starting quarterbacks—Los Angeles&#x27;s Tommy Maddox, San Francisco&#x27;s Mike Pawlawski and Memphis&#x27;s Jim Druckenmiller—were still starters by the end of the season. Birmingham and Las Vegas were both on their third-string quarterbacks by the end of the ten-week season.

The XFL postseason format was essentially identical to the one adopted by the AFL for its final season in 1969. The top two teams in each division qualified for the playoffs. To avoid teams having to play each other three times in a season prior to the championship game, the league set up the semifinal round of the playoffs so that the games would feature teams from opposite divisions: the east division champion (Orlando) hosted the west division runner-up (San Francisco), and likewise for the west champion and east runner-up (Los Angeles and Chicago, respectively). Los Angeles and San Francisco each won their playoff games to advance to the XFL championship.

===Off the field===
The opening game ended with a 19–0 victory for the Outlaws, and was watched on NBC by an estimated 14 million viewers. During the telecast, NBC switched over to the game between the Orlando Rage and the Chicago Enforcers, which was a closer contest than the blowout taking place in Las Vegas. The opening night drew a 9.5 Nielsen rating.

The opening-week games actually delivered ratings double those of what NBC had promised advertisers (and more viewers than the 2001 Pro Bowl). The audience declined to a 4.6 in week 2, still an acceptable rating for NBC, but further ratings declines eventually led to the network abandoning the league after the season.

A further problem was that the XFL itself was the brainchild of Vince McMahon, a man who was ridiculed by mainstream sports journalists due to the stigma attached to professional wrestling as being &quot;fake&quot;; many journalists even jokingly speculated whether any of the league&#x27;s games were rigged, although nothing of this sort was ever seriously investigated.

Ebersol was disappointed with the opening game&#x27;s poor quality of play. Even longtime NBC sportscaster Bob Costas joined in the mocking of the league. Ebersol purposely allowed Costas and other NBC Sports veterans to opt out of the network&#x27;s coverage of the league (hence with the exception of former &quot;NFL on NBC&quot; analyst Mike Adamle, its coverage was helmed mostly by younger unknowns and professional wrestling figures), and Costas in particular did not like McMahon&#x27;s approach to the sport. In an appearance on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; in February 2001, after the league&#x27;s second week of play, Costas joked: &quot;It has to be at least a decade since I first mused out loud, &#x27;Why doesn&#x27;t somebody combine mediocre high school football with a tawdry strip club?&#x27; Finally, somebody takes my idea and runs with it.&quot; Costas interviewed a defiant McMahon for an episode of his HBO show &quot;On the Record&quot; as the league was in decline, an interview that the 2017 documentary &quot;This Was the XFL&quot; portrayed as being an omen of the league&#x27;s collapse.

==XFL rule changes==
Despite boasts of a &quot;rules-light&quot; game and universally negative reviews from the mainstream sports media early on, the XFL played the standard brand of 11-man American outdoor football that was recognizable, aside from the opening game sprint to determine possession and some other changes, some of which were modified during the season as it progressed. The league&#x27;s coaches vetoed a proposal to eliminate ineligible receivers (allowing any player to receive a forward pass) midway through the season, on account that the change would be too radical.

===Game balls===
The league&#x27;s game balls were made by Spalding, and were unique in that instead of being the standard brown, the ball was black with a red &quot;X&quot; going across the sides of the ball. The balls were later found to be slippery and difficult to handle, and the balls had to be rubbed with sandpaper to make them usable.

===Grass stadiums===
The league deliberately avoided placing teams in stadiums with artificial turf, which at the time had a bad reputation both for being unsightly as well as being more hazardous to play on compared to natural turf. The league&#x27;s requirement for grass fields automatically ruled out the use of domed stadiums since no such stadium capable of accommodating a grass football field existed in the U.S. in 2001 (the only retractable roof stadiums complete at the time were used exclusively for Major League Baseball; the first retractable roof stadium for NFL use was not completed until Reliant Stadium opened for the expansion Houston Texans in 2002). Furthermore, every XFL field was designed identically, with no individual team branding on the field. Each end zone and 50 yard line was decorated with the XFL logo, with the endzones also being painted black.

Most of the league&#x27;s stadiums were football-specific facilities, the only exception being San Francisco&#x27;s Pacific Bell Park (home of the San Francisco Giants) which was built primarily for baseball, but (unlike many newer baseball-specific stadiums) can accommodate football. Two XFL stadiums (Giants Stadium and Soldier Field) were also then-current NFL stadiums, while two others (Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium) had previously hosted NFL games; the NFL would return to the Coliseum when the Rams returned to Los Angeles in 2016. The remaining fields were in regular use as college football venues at the time.

The home team in every stadium was required to occupy the sideline opposite the press box in order to be visible to the television cameras. Due to the odd field dimensions in San Francisco, teams playing there were permitted to occupy the same sideline (a similar arrangement existed in the NFL when the Green Bay Packers played home games at Milwaukee County Stadium and in stadiums previously used by the Chicago Bears, Detroit Lions, Kansas City Chiefs and Minnesota Vikings).

The all-grass field stipulation caused the league to skip over several of the country&#x27;s largest markets, including Houston and Philadelphia, since they lacked a large grass stadium in 2001. In the league&#x27;s two northernmost markets, Chicago and New York/New Jersey (the latter of which played in Giants Stadium during a brief window in which the stadium&#x27;s usual artificial turf had been replaced by natural grass), the combination of the all-grass requirement, midwinter playing season and the fact that the XFL followed shortly after the NFL had used both fields for a full season (in Giants Stadium&#x27;s case, two full seasons, since the Giants and Jets shared the stadium; the Giants also hosted two playoff games following the 2000 season) caused significant damage to the playing fields; at Chicago&#x27;s Soldier Field, the wear and tear on the field was such that by midseason, the midfield logo of the NFL&#x27;s Chicago Bears was clearly visible amid a stretch of dirt and dead grass.

At the time, &quot;next generation&quot; artificial surfaces (which much more closely mimicked grass in appearance, feel and player safety) were slowly being introduced in professional football. In 2000, the Seattle Seahawks were the first professional team to play on next-generation artificial turf at the University of Washington&#x27;s Husky Stadium, where the Seahawks played in 2000 and 2001 following the demolition of the Kingdome and prior to the completion of what is now Lumen Field). Giants Stadium would have a next generation artificial surface installed in 2003; Soldier Field was renovated extensively in 2002 but retained its grass field. Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium and Legion Field have also installed next-generation turf fields since the demise of the original XFL.

===Opening scramble===
Replacing the coin toss at the beginning of each game was an event in which one player from each team fought to recover a football 20 yards away in order to determine possession. Both players lined up side by side on one of the 30-yard lines, with the ball being placed at the 50-yard line. At the whistle, the two players would run toward the ball and attempt to gain possession; whichever player gained possession first was allowed to choose possession (as if he had won a coin toss in other leagues). The XFL&#x27;s first injury infamously resulted from the opening scramble; Orlando free safety Hassan Shamsid-Deen suffered a separated shoulder prior to the Rage&#x27;s 33–29 season-opening win over the Chicago Enforcers at Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium on February 3. He ended up missing the remainder of the campaign.

===No PAT (point after touchdown) kicks===
After every touchdown scored, no extra point after kicks were done, due to the XFL&#x27;s perception that an extra-point kick was a &quot;guaranteed point.&quot; To earn a point after a touchdown, teams ran a single offensive down from the two-yard line (functionally identical to the NFL / NCAA / CFL two-point conversion, but for just a single point as it had been before the two-point conversion was adopted). By the playoffs, two-point and three-point conversions had been added to the rules. Teams could opt for the bonus points by playing the conversion farther back from the goal line. However, touchdowns were still worth 6 points.

This rule, as originally implemented, was similar to the WFL&#x27;s &quot;Action Point&quot;, and was identical to a 1968 &quot;Pressure Point&quot; experiment by the NFL and the American Football League, used only in preseason interleague games that year.

In 2015, the NFL, CFL and other professional leagues would address the &quot;guaranteed point&quot; concerns by moving the extra point kick back to the 15-yard and 25-yard lines, respectively, thus making the length of the kick the same distance (taking into account the NFL&#x27;s position of the goalposts on the end line, and the CFL&#x27;s goalposts being positioned on the goal line). The Alliance of American Football (AAF) in 2019 adopted this &quot;no extra point kick&quot; rule from the original XFL, albeit making the scrimmage play conversion two points as in other levels of the game. The revived XFL kept the conversion system used during the playoffs.

===Overtime===
Ties were to be resolved in similar fashion to the NCAA and in the CFL today, with at least one possession by each team, starting from the opponent&#x27;s 20-yard line. There were differences: there were no first downs and thus teams had to score within four downs, and the team that had possession first in overtime could not attempt a field goal until fourth down. If that team managed to score a touchdown in fewer than four downs, the second team would only have that same number of downs to match or beat the result. If the score was still tied after one overtime period, the team that played second on offense in the first OT would start on offense in the second OT (similar to the rules of college football overtime). The process would be repeated until a winner was determined; unlike the CFL and NFL, but like college football, games could not end in ties even in the regular season.

===Bump and run===
The XFL allowed full bump and run coverage early in the season. Defensive backs were allowed to hit wide receivers any time before the quarterback released the ball, as long as the hit came from the front or the side.

Following the fourth week of the season, bump and run was restricted to the first five yards from the line of scrimmage (similar to NFL and CFL) in an effort to increase offensive production.

===Forward motion===
Unlike the NFL, but like the World Football League and Arena Football League before it, the XFL allowed one offensive player to move toward the line of scrimmage once he was outside the tackles.

===Punting rules===
The XFL imposed a number of restrictions on punting that are not present in most other leagues&#x27; rules, the net effect of which made punts in the XFL operate under rules more akin to kickoffs. The purpose of these provisions was to keep play going after the ball was punted, encouraging the kicking team to make the ball playable and the receiving team to run it back. To this effect:
* Punting out of bounds was a ten-yard penalty, effectively outlawing the coffin corner punt commonplace at most other levels of the game.
* Any punt that traveled at least 25 yards past the line of scrimmage could be recovered by the kicking team, thus legalizing to an extent the up-and-under or garryowen common to rugby football codes. Thus, instead of letting the kicking team down the ball as is common in other leagues, the receiving team was required to try and return the punt or else lose possession.
* The kicking team was prohibited from coming within five yards of the punt returner before he gained possession of the ball. This rule, known as the halo rule in college football and also common in the CFL, was dubbed the &quot;danger zone&quot; in the XFL. Coming within 5yards or less of this &quot;danger zone&quot; entailed a penalty, much in the same vein as the CFL&#x27;s &quot;no yards&quot; penalty.
* Fair catches were not recognized. (The &quot;no fair catch&quot; rule was one of the most heavily hyped rule differences in the XFL and a central part of the league&#x27;s marketing campaign, and like the above &quot;no yards&quot; penalty, fair catches were not recognized in Canadian football.)

For the initial weeks of the season, the XFL forbade all players on the kicking team from going downfield before a kick was made from scrimmage on that down, similarly to a rule the NFL considered in 1974. For the rest of the season the XFL modified it to allow one player closest to each sideline downfield ahead of the kick, the same modification the NFL adopted to their change just before their 1974 exhibition games started.

Allowing the kicking team to recover a punt did encourage noticeably more quick kicks over the course of the XFL&#x27;s lone season than was typically seen in the NFL over the preceding decades, including a quick kick during the Million Dollar Game (that particular kick, executed by San Francisco on a third-and-31 play, succeeded in taking Los Angeles off-guard, but the kick also backfired as the Demons could not recover the kick and Los Angeles returned it for a touchdown).

===Play clock===
The XFL used a play clock of 35 seconds from the end of the previous play, five seconds shorter than the contemporary NFL play clock of 40 seconds (but still longer than the CFL&#x27;s 20 seconds, timed from the spotting of the football), in an effort to speed up the game.

===Roster and salaries===
The XFL limited each team to an unusually low 38 players, as opposed to 53 on NFL teams and 80 or more on unlimited college rosters. This was similar to the CFL, which had a comparable 40 man roster limit in 2001. This was partly to limit payroll costs, and partly because the XFL wanted to curb the use of &quot;specialists,&quot; something which the NFL has sometimes come under criticism for. To comply with roster limits, most teams only carried two quarterbacks and one kicker who doubled as the punter.

The XFL paid standardized player salaries. Quarterbacks earned US$5,000 per week, kickers earned $3,500, and all other uniformed players earned $4,500 per week, though a few players got around these restrictions (Los Angeles Xtreme players Noel Prefontaine, the league&#x27;s lone punting specialist, and Matt Malloy, a wide receiver) by having themselves listed as backup quarterbacks. Players on a winning team received a bonus of $2,500 for the week, $7,500 for winning a playoff game. The team that won the championship game split $1,000,000 (roughly $25,000 per player). Players did not receive any fringe benefits, and had to pay for their own health insurance.

===Jersey nicknames===
The XFL allowed its players to wear a nickname on the back of their jersey, as opposed to the legal last name most professional sports leagues have required since the 1960s. Players could change the nickname any time they wanted, and a few players chose to change the nicknames on a weekly basis depending on their opponent. The league&#x27;s use of backfield camera angles gave these nicknames even greater exposure. Nevertheless, two teams, Orlando and Birmingham, imposed policies that forbade players from using nicknames. Orlando&#x27;s ban was voted upon by the players, although Jeff Brohm objected. Birmingham&#x27;s players were banned from doing so by coach Gerry DiNardo, a notoriously strict disciplinarian more accustomed to coaching at the college level. DiNardo previously alienated players at Vanderbilt and LSU and later did so at Indiana with his iron-fisted rule. The Thunderbolts were the only professional team he would ever coach.

Rod Smart, a running back who played in the first XFL nationally televised game, was the first player to gain notice from his nickname, &quot;He Hate Me.&quot;

==Broadcast overview==

===Camera perspectives===
Although the XFL was not the first football league to feature the &quot;sky cam&quot;, which enables TV viewers to see behind the offensive unit, it helped to popularize its unique capabilities. For the first several weeks, the league used the sky cam and on-field cameramen (nicknamed the &quot;Bubba Cam&quot; after WWE&#x27;s cameraman, Bubba, who couldn&#x27;t get medical clearance to cover the XFL) extensively, giving the television broadcasts a perspective similar to video games such as the &quot;Madden&quot; series.

During player interviews, particularly later in the season as attendances declined, the television crews took extensive efforts to avoid capturing the empty stands on camera. When they did show the stands, it was just mostly close ups of individual sections that were full. Player interviews at sparsely-attended games were often shot from a camera angle in close proximity and low to the ground pointed upward, giving the perspective of the camera being operated by a little person.

After the XFL&#x27;s failure, the sky cam was adopted by the NFL&#x27;s broadcasters; the device has subsequently come into use on all major networks. NBC in particular switched back to the XFL camera angles in 2017, when traditional cameras were too far away to cut through thick fog and smoke on some of the &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; games that year; response was so positive that the network opted to use two of its &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; games to experiment with intentionally broadcasting most of the game through that angle.

===Broadcast schedule===
At the beginning of the season, NBC showed a feature game at 8 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday nights, also taping a second game. The second game, in some weeks, would air in the visiting team&#x27;s home market (as was the case in week 6 for the Enforcers-Maniax game, and in week 7, for the Maniax-Hitmen game) and be put on the air nationally if the feature game was a blowout (as was the case in week one) or encountered technical difficulties (as was the case in week two). Two games were shown each Sunday: one at 4 p.m. Eastern on TNN and another at 7 p.m. Eastern on UPN. The XFL also had a fairly extensive local radio presence, often using nationally recognized disc jockeys. The morning radio duo of Rick and Bubba, for instance, was the radio broadcast team for the Birmingham Thunderbolts. Super Dave Osborne was a sideline reporter for Los Angeles Xtreme broadcasts on KLSX; WMVP carried Chicago Enforcers games.

Unusually for a professional league, the XFL did not feature a studio wraparound. The network offered &quot;XFL Gameday&quot;, a pregame show featuring radio shock jocks Opie and Anthony for the first four weeks of the season, but the show was not carried nationwide and most affiliates joined in just before the game. Halftime consisted mostly of live look-ins into the player locker rooms, as coaches discussed their strategy and halftime adjustments with their players, as well as cheerleader performances. The XFL also, at McMahon&#x27;s request, followed a somewhat different format than traditional professional football telecasts: The announcers more closely followed the model of professional wrestling where the color commentator had a villain-like role, while the sideline reporters (who were predominantly male, a rare example of the XFL being more conservative than the NFL at the time, which was incorporating attractive female sideline reporters) were former players and experienced sportscasters who were relied upon for more expert analysis than usual.

In the third week of the season, the games were sped up through changes in the playing rules, and broadcasts were subjected to increased time constraints. The reason was the reaction of Lorne Michaels, creator and executive producer of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, to the length of the Los Angeles Xtreme versus Chicago Enforcers game that went into double overtime. The double overtime periods combined with a power outage earlier in the game due to someone not fueling a generator before the game delayed the contest, causing the start of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; to be pushed back from 11:30 p.m. Eastern Time to 12:15 a.m. Sunday morning. This angered Michaels, who expected high ratings with Jennifer Lopez as the show&#x27;s host. For the rest of the season, the XFL cut off coverage at 11:00 Eastern Time, regardless of whether or not the game was over (there were exceptions, for the Chicago and Memphis markets for the Enforcers-Maniax game in week 6, and in New York and Memphis markets for the Maniax-Hitmen game in week 7). NBC Sports has retained this policy for other sports it runs in Saturday night time slots since the XFL&#x27;s closure; in 2018, a National Hockey League telecast was cut off under similar circumstances.

In the face of declining ratings, NBC and the XFL aggressively promoted that the week 6 game between the Orlando Rage and Las Vegas Outlaws would feature a behind-the-scenes visit into the locker room of the Rage&#x27;s cheerleaders at halftime. The heavily promoted event was actually a pre-recorded sketch with McMahon and a cameraman, who knocks himself unconscious on the locker room door trying to run in. This was followed by a suggestive dream sequence with the cheerleaders, including a surprise cameo by Rodney Dangerfield. The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; reported that the scene would likely be the &quot;[last] salacious WWF-style stunt for the rest of the season&quot;, citing internal sources indicating that NBC wished to pivot the telecasts back towards a football-oriented product, including hiring NFL alumni as analysts, and reinstating Vasgersian as the lead commentator.

===Broadcast teams===

* NBC (national telecasts):
** Week 1, Matt Vasgersian, Jesse Ventura, Fred Roggin and Mike Adamle.
** Week 2–5: Jim Ross, Ventura, Roggin and Adamle
** Week 6–10: Vasgersian, Ventura, Adamle, Roggin and Chris Wragge. Adamle moved from the sidelines to the booth with Vasgerian and Ventura.
* NBC (regional telecasts):
** Week 1: Ross, Jerry Lawler, Jonathan Coachman. For week 1, Ross and Lawler were billed as their WWF personas, &quot;J.R.&quot; and &quot;The King.&quot;
** Week 2–5: Vasgersian, Lawler, and Coachman. McMahon personally demoted Vasgersian to the regional telecast after openly criticizing a suggestive shot of the cheerleaders as &quot;uncomfortable&quot; on-air during the week 1 broadcast.
** Week 6–10: Ross, Dick Butkus or Dan Hampton, and Coachman. Lawler left the XFL (and WWF) in protest after week five in the aftermath of the firing of his then-wife, Stacy Carter, as well as his own dissatisfaction with being pressured into commentary on XFL games; Lawler openly admitted on-air that he had virtually no interest or background in football, an unusual trait for a color analyst. After Lawler&#x27;s departure, NBC brought Vasgersian back up to the main broadcast team. Hampton and Butkus rotated as the regional color analyst for the rest of the season.
* TNN: Craig Minervini, Bob Golic, Lee Reherman and Kip Lewis.
* UPN: Chris Marlowe, Brian Bosworth, Chris Wragge and Michael Barkann.

==Critical reception==
It was believed that the willingness of Las Vegas bookmakers to take bets on XFL games established their legitimacy, dispelling concerns that the league was using predetermined storylines as in professional wrestling. However, the league was panned by critics as boring football with a tawdry broadcast style, although the broadcasts on TNN and to a lesser extent UPN and the Matt Vasgersian–helmed NBC coverage were considered comparatively professional.

==End of season and failure==
On April 21, 2001, the season concluded as the Los Angeles Xtreme defeated the San Francisco Demons 38–6 in the XFL Championship Game (which was originally given the moniker &quot;The Big Game at the End of the Season&quot;, but was later dubbed the Million Dollar Game, after the amount of money awarded to the winning team, which if divided, gave each player less than the losing team in the Pro Bowl).

Though paid attendance at games remained respectable, if unimpressive (overall attendance was only 10% below what the league&#x27;s goal had been at the start of the season), the XFL ceased operations after just one season due to low television ratings. Facing stiff competition from the NCAA basketball tournament, the NBC telecast of the Chicago/New York-New Jersey game on March 31 received a 1.5 rating, at that time the lowest ever for any major network primetime weekend first-run sports television broadcast in the United States. During the season, many news and sports networks (even local networks within XFL cities) did not show highlights or even report scores. This led audiences to view the XFL as a joke league rather than a direct competitor to the NFL.

Despite initially agreeing to broadcast XFL games for two years and owning half of the league, NBC announced it would not broadcast a second XFL season; the network no longer had a full season of Saturday nights to offer the league because it had acquired the rights to the 2002 Winter Olympics, even if the XFL had been more successful or profitable. WWF Chairman Vince McMahon initially announced that the XFL would continue, as it still had UPN and TNN as broadcast outlets. In fact, expansion teams were being explored for cities such as Washington, D.C., and Detroit (Washington would later receive its team in the revived XFL). However, in order to continue broadcasting XFL games, UPN demanded that &quot;WWF SmackDown!&quot; broadcasts be cut from two hours to one and a half hours. McMahon found these terms unacceptable and he announced the XFL&#x27;s closure on May 10, 2001. McMahon&#x27;s chief adviser, a perplexed Nathan Livian, was quoted as saying &quot;the situation is, indeed, very bad&quot;.

The XFL ranked No. 3 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s list of the worst TV shows of all time in July 2002, as well as No. 2 on ESPN&#x27;s list of biggest flops in sports, behind Ryan Leaf. In 2010, TV Guide Network also listed the show at No. 21 on their list of &quot;25 Biggest TV Blunders&quot;.

Many stories recapping the history of the XFL show photos of the crash of its promotional blimp in Oakland, California, portraying it retrospectively as an ill-omen for the league. The incident occurred a month before the opening game on Tuesday, January 9, 2001. The blimp was in Oakland as the league had flown it over the January 6 playoff game between the Oakland Raiders and Miami Dolphins and intended to do the same with the following week&#x27;s AFC Championship, also in Oakland. The pilots lost control of the airship and were forced to evacuate. The ground crew were unable to secure the vehicle and the &quot;unattended blimp then floated five miles north over the Oakland Estuary, at one point reaching 1,600feet, or about the height of the Central Park Tower in Midtown Manhattan (listed as the second tallest building in the United States ), until its gondola caught on a sailboat mast in the Central Basin marina. It draped over the roof of the Oyster Reef restaurant—next to where the boat was moored—and a nearby power line.&quot; While the pilot was hospitalized, no other major injuries were reported. The blimp needed $2.5million in repairs (equivalent to $million in ), while the sailboat and restaurant had only minor damages.

Before the season started, a fictional XFL game appeared in the 2000 film &quot;The 6th Day&quot;, set in 2015.

==Legacy==
NBC continued airing professional league football beyond the demise of the XFL, starting with the Arena Football League (AFL) television coverage from 2003 to 2006. In 2006, NBC returned to coverage of NFL games with &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot;, eventually adding &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; to its coverage in 2016.

The XFL&#x27;s racier-than-average cheerleaders helped inspire the Lingerie Football League (now Extreme Football League) and the &quot;Lingerie Bowl&quot; from 2003 to 2006. The LFL is currently the largest women&#x27;s American football professional league.

XFL team names and logos sometimes appear in movies and television where professional football needs to be dramatized, as licensing for NFL logos may be cost prohibitive (such as in the Arnold Schwarzenegger starring sci-fi film &quot;The 6th Day&quot;).

The United Football League later placed all four of its inaugural franchises in former XFL markets and stadiums. However, the UFL drew far fewer fans than the XFL average, and much less media attention: for example, the XFL&#x27;s San Francisco Demons drew an average of 35,000 fans, while the UFL&#x27;s California Redwoods drew an average of 6,000, despite both playing in the same ballpark. Three of the four charter teams, including the Redwoods, moved to other markets by the time of the UFL&#x27;s third season.

ESPN produced a documentary surrounding the league, &quot;This Was the XFL&quot;, as part of its anthology series &quot;30 for 30&quot; (the title is a play on Vince McMahon shouting &quot;This is the XFL!&quot; before the opening game, changing &quot;is&quot; to &quot;was&quot; since the league failed). The film discusses the longtime friendship between McMahon and Ebersol, as seen through the eyes of Dick&#x27;s son, Charlie Ebersol, who directs the film. McMahon, Dick Ebersol, Dick Schanzer, Rusty Tillman, Al Luginbill, Rod Smart, Tommy Maddox, Paris Lenon, league President Basil DeVito, costume designer Jay Howarth, Jesse Ventura, Matt Vasgersian, Jonathan Coachman, Bob Costas and Jerry Jones all provided interviews for the film. It debuted at Doc NYC November 11, 2016, and premiered on ESPN on February 2, 2017.

==Notable players==
Notable players included league MVP and Los Angeles quarterback Tommy Maddox, who signed with the NFL&#x27;s Pittsburgh Steelers after the XFL folded (Maddox later became the starting quarterback for the Steelers in 2002 and led them to that year&#x27;s playoffs, as well as continuing to start for them into 2004). Los Angeles used the first pick in the XFL draft to select a former NFL quarterback, Scott Milanovich. Milanovich lost the starting quarterback job to Maddox, who was placed on the Xtreme as one of a handful of players put on each team due to geographic distance between the player&#x27;s college and the team&#x27;s hometown. Another of the better-known players was Las Vegas running back Rod Smart, who first gained popularity because the name on the back of his jersey read &quot;He Hate Me.&quot; Smart, who was only picked 357th in the draft, later went on to play for the Philadelphia Eagles, Carolina Panthers, Oakland Raiders and the Edmonton Eskimos of the CFL. His Panther teammate Jake Delhomme named his newborn horse &quot;She Hate Me&quot; as a reference to him. Smart played in Super Bowl XXXVIII, becoming one of seven XFL players to play in a Super Bowl. Receiver Yo Murphy also achieved this as a member of the St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI, along with winning the 95th Grey Cup with the Saskatchewan Roughriders in 2007. Tommy Maddox played for a Super Bowl team (the Pittsburgh Steelers) in Super Bowl XL in Detroit, (although Maddox, by then a third-string quarterback, did not play in the game, which turned out to be his last appearance in uniform before retiring). Lastly, Las Vegas Outlaws DB Kelly Herndon played in Super Bowl XL with the Seattle Seahawks in 2005, where he is remembered for intercepting a pass and returning it a then-record 76 yards. Although he did not play for an NFL team after the XFL&#x27;s lone season, former Las Vegas Outlaw offensive guard Isaac Davis also had a notable NFL career, playing in 58 games over a six-year career. Davis started for the San Diego Chargers in Super Bowl XXIX. John Avery went on to play for both the Edmonton Eskimos and the Toronto Argonauts where he was an All Star selection in 2002 and won a Grey Cup in 2004.

The last active player to have played in the XFL is Canadian placekicker Paul McCallum, who last played for the BC Lions in the 2016 CFL season.

==Current status and revival==
The 2001 XFL games are now part of the WWE Video Library, the rights to which have been held by NBC&#x27;s streaming service Peacock since March 2021.

In September 2012, WWE attempted to file a new XFL trademark for use in wrestling and football which was previously filed in 2009 under XFL LLC. The application remained pending since WWE never put together a &quot;Statement of Use&quot; for the trademark. In July 2015, the XFL&#x27;s first trademark extension was granted.

On December 15, 2017, it was reported that McMahon was seriously considering a revival of the XFL. WWE didn&#x27;t confirm or deny the rumors, but released a statement that McMahon was launching a new company known as Alpha Entertainment, that was looking to expand into sports and entertainment properties &quot;including professional football&quot;, and that WWE itself wasn&#x27;t returning to professional football.

Noted wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer speculated that McMahon was starting a shell corporation with his own money to protect WWE shareholders on a potential XFL revival. A revival of the XFL would air either on traditional TV or the WWE Network, and would be toned down compared to its original incarnation due to CTE concerns in football that surfaced in the early 2010s. On December 22, 2017, McMahon sold $100 million worth of WWE shares, which required notification to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission; the SEC reported that it was done so that McMahon could fund Alpha Entertainment. WWE shares did in fact decline slightly due to the report, with Citigroup downgrading WWE shares from &quot;buy&quot; to &quot;neutral&quot;.

On January 25, 2018, Alpha Entertainment announced a new incarnation of the XFL which began play in 2020. The XFL does not utilize the same sports entertainment gimmicks as the original, instead focusing on adjusting rules to increase the speed of play. NBC has no involvement with this incarnation, which is instead carried by the outlets of ESPN Inc. and (during its 2020 season) Fox Corporation. Following the 2020 season (cut short by stay-at-home orders tied to the COVID pandemic), McMahon sold the XFL to a consortium led by his former wrestler Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) along with Johnson&#x27;s business partners Dany Garcia and RedBird Capital. The league played one season in 2023, but would later merge with the USFL (established by Fox Corporation during the XFL&#x27;s 2020–23 hiatus) to form the United Football League, with the XFL name kept as a conference name.

<text>Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language and file format for storing, transmitting, and reconstructing data. It defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. The World Wide Web Consortium&#x27;s XML 1.0 Specification of 1998 and several other related specifications—all of them free open standards—define XML.

The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet. It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the design of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures, such as those used in web services.

Several schema systems exist to aid in the definition of XML-based languages, while programmers have developed many application programming interfaces (APIs) to aid the processing of XML data.

== Overview ==
The main purpose of XML is serialization, i.e. storing, transmitting, and reconstructing arbitrary data. For two disparate systems to exchange information, they need to agree upon a file format. XML standardizes this process. It is therefore analogous to a lingua franca for representing information.

As a markup language, XML labels, categorizes, and structurally organizes information. XML tags represent the data structure and contain metadata. What is within the tags is data, encoded in the way the XML standard specifies. An additional XML schema (XSD) defines the necessary metadata for interpreting and validating XML. (This is also referred to as the canonical schema.) An XML document that adheres to basic XML rules is &quot;well-formed&quot;; one that adheres to its schema is &quot;valid&quot;.

IETF RFC 7303 (which supersedes the older RFC 3023), provides rules for the construction of media types for use in XML message. It defines three media types: codice_1 (codice_2 is an alias), codice_3 (codice_4 is an alias) and codice_5. They are used for transmitting raw XML files without exposing their internal semantics. RFC 7303 further recommends that XML-based languages be given media types ending in codice_6, for example, codice_7 for SVG.

Further guidelines for the use of XML in a networked context appear in RFC 3470, also known as IETF BCP 70, a document covering many aspects of designing and deploying an XML-based language.

== Applications ==
XML has come into common use for the interchange of data over the Internet. Hundreds of document formats using XML syntax have been developed, including RSS, Atom, Office Open XML, OpenDocument, SVG, COLLADA, and XHTML. XML also provides the base language for communication protocols such as SOAP and XMPP. It is one of the message exchange formats used in the Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) programming technique.

Many industry data standards, such as Health Level 7, OpenTravel Alliance, FpML, MISMO, and National Information Exchange Model are based on XML and the rich features of the XML schema specification. In publishing, Darwin Information Typing Architecture is an XML industry data standard. XML is used extensively to underpin various publishing formats.

One of the applications of XML in science is the representation of operational meteorology information based on IWXXM standards.

== Key terminology ==
The material in this section is based on the XML Specification. This is not an exhaustive list of all the constructs that appear in XML; it provides an introduction to the key constructs most often encountered in day-to-day use.

;: An XML document is a string of &quot;characters&quot;. Every legal Unicode character (except Null) may appear in an (1.1) XML document (while some are discouraged).

;: The &quot;processor&quot; analyzes the markup and passes structured information to an &quot;application&quot;. The specification places requirements on what an XML processor must do and not do, but the application is outside its scope. The processor (as the specification calls it) is often referred to colloquially as an &quot;XML parser&quot;.

;: The characters making up an XML document are divided into &quot;markup&quot; and &quot;content&quot;, which may be distinguished by the application of simple syntactic rules. Generally, strings that constitute markup either begin with the character codice_8 and end with a codice_9, or they begin with the character codice_10 and end with a codice_11. Strings of characters that are not markup are content. However, in a CDATA section, the delimiters codice_12 and codice_13 are classified as markup, while the text between them is classified as content. In addition, whitespace before and after the outermost element is classified as markup.

;: A &quot;tag&quot; is a markup construct that begins with codice_8 and ends with codice_9. There are three types of tag:
:* &quot;start-tag&quot;, such as codice_16;
:* &quot;end-tag&quot;, such as codice_17;
:* &quot;empty-element tag&quot;, such as codice_18.

;: An &quot;element&quot; is a logical document component that either begins with a start-tag and ends with a matching end-tag or consists only of an empty-element tag. The characters between the start-tag and end-tag, if any, are the element&#x27;s &quot;content&quot;, and may contain markup, including other elements, which are called &quot;child elements&quot;. An example is codice_19. Another is codice_20.

;: An &quot;attribute&quot; is a markup construct consisting of a name–value pair that exists within a start-tag or empty-element tag. An example is codice_21, where the names of the attributes are &quot;src&quot; and &quot;alt&quot;, and their values are &quot;madonna.jpg&quot; and &quot;Madonna&quot; respectively. Another example is codice_22, where the name of the attribute is &quot;number&quot; and its value is &quot;3&quot;. An XML attribute can only have a single value and each attribute can appear at most once on each element. In the common situation where a list of multiple values is desired, this must be done by encoding the list into a well-formed XML attribute with some format beyond what XML defines itself. Usually this is either a comma or semi-colon delimited list or, if the individual values are known not to contain spaces, a space-delimited list can be used. An example with space as a delimiter is codice_23, where the attribute &quot;class&quot; both has the value &quot;inner greeting-box&quot; and also indicates the two CSS class names &quot;inner&quot; and &quot;greeting-box&quot;.

;: XML documents may begin with an &quot;XML declaration&quot; that describes some information about themselves. An example is codice_24.

== Characters and escaping ==
XML documents consist entirely of characters from the Unicode repertoire. Except for a small number of specifically excluded control characters, any character defined by Unicode may appear within the content of an XML document.

XML includes facilities for identifying the &quot;encoding&quot; of the Unicode characters that make up the document, and for expressing characters that, for one reason or another, cannot be used directly.

=== Valid characters ===

Unicode code points in the following ranges are valid in XML 1.0 documents:
* U+0009 (Horizontal Tab), U+000A (Line Feed), U+000D (Carriage Return): these are the only C0 controls accepted in XML 1.0;
* U+0020–U+D7FF, U+E000–U+FFFD: this excludes some noncharacters in the BMP (all surrogates, U+FFFE and U+FFFF are forbidden);
* U+10000–U+10FFFF: this includes all code points in supplementary planes, including noncharacters.

XML 1.1 extends the set of allowed characters to include all the above, plus the remaining characters in the range U+0001–U+001F. At the same time, however, it restricts the use of C0 and C1 control characters other than U+0009 (Horizontal Tab), U+000A (Line Feed), U+000D (Carriage Return), and U+0085 (Next Line) by requiring them to be written in escaped form (for example U+0001 must be written as codice_25 or its equivalent). In the case of C1 characters, this restriction is a backwards incompatibility; it was introduced to allow common encoding errors to be detected.

The code point U+0000 (Null) is the only character that is not permitted in any XML 1.1 document.

=== Encoding detection ===
The Unicode character set can be encoded into bytes for storage or transmission in a variety of different ways, called &quot;encodings&quot;. Unicode itself defines encodings that cover the entire repertoire; well-known ones include UTF-8 (which the XML standard recommends using, without a BOM) and UTF-16. There are many other text encodings that predate Unicode, such as ASCII and various ISO/IEC 8859; their character repertoires are in every case subsets of the Unicode character set.

XML allows the use of any of the Unicode-defined encodings and any other encodings whose characters also appear in Unicode. XML also provides a mechanism whereby an XML processor can reliably, without any prior knowledge, determine which encoding is being used. Encodings other than UTF-8 and UTF-16 are not necessarily recognized by every XML parser (and in some cases not even UTF-16, even though the standard mandates it to also be recognized).

=== Escaping ===
XML provides &quot;escape&quot; facilities for including characters that are problematic to include directly. For example:
* The characters &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&amp;&quot; are key syntax markers and may never appear in content outside a CDATA section. It is allowed, but not recommended, to use &quot;&lt;&quot; in XML entity values.
* Some character encodings support only a subset of Unicode. For example, it is legal to encode an XML document in ASCII, but ASCII lacks code points for Unicode characters such as &quot;é&quot;.
* It might not be possible to type the character on the author&#x27;s machine.
* Some characters have glyphs that cannot be visually distinguished from other characters, such as the nonbreaking space (codice_26) &quot; &quot; and the space (codice_27) &quot; &quot;, and the Cyrillic capital letter A (codice_28) &quot;А&quot; and the Latin capital letter A (codice_29) &quot;A&quot;.

There are five predefined entities:
* codice_30 represents &quot;&lt;&quot;;
* codice_31 represents &quot;&gt;&quot;;
* codice_32 represents &quot;&amp;&quot;;
* codice_33 represents &quot;&quot;;
* codice_34 represents &quot;.

All permitted Unicode characters may be represented with a &quot;numeric character reference&quot;. Consider the Chinese character &quot;中&quot;, whose numeric code in Unicode is hexadecimal 4E2D, or decimal 20,013. A user whose keyboard offers no method for entering this character could still insert it in an XML document encoded either as codice_35 or codice_36. Similarly, the string &quot;I &lt;3 Jörg&quot; could be encoded for inclusion in an XML document as codice_37.

codice_38 is not permitted because the null character is one of the control characters excluded from XML, even when using a numeric character reference. An alternative encoding mechanism such as Base64 is needed to represent such characters.

=== Comments ===
Comments may appear anywhere in a document outside other markup. Comments cannot appear before the XML declaration. Comments begin with codice_39 and end with codice_40. For compatibility with SGML, the string &quot;--&quot; (double-hyphen) is not allowed inside comments; this means comments cannot be nested. The ampersand has no special significance within comments, so entity and character references are not recognized as such, and there is no way to represent characters outside the character set of the document encoding.

An example of a valid comment:
codice_41

=== International use ===
XML 1.0 (Fifth Edition) and XML 1.1 support the direct use of almost any Unicode character in element names, attributes, comments, character data, and processing instructions (other than the ones that have special symbolic meaning in XML itself, such as the less-than sign, &quot;&lt;&quot;). The following is a well-formed XML document including Chinese, Armenian and Cyrillic characters:

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;俄语 լեզու=&quot;ռուսերեն&quot;&gt;данные&lt;/俄语&gt;
== Syntactical correctness and error-handling ==
The XML specification defines an XML document as a well-formed text, meaning that it satisfies a list of syntax rules provided in the specification. Some key points include:
* The document contains only properly encoded legal Unicode characters.
* None of the special syntax characters such as codice_8 and codice_10 appear except when performing their markup-delineation roles.
* The start-tag, end-tag, and empty-element tag that delimit elements are correctly nested, with none missing and none overlapping.
* Tag names are case-sensitive; the start-tag and end-tag must match exactly.
* Tag names cannot contain any of the characters codice_44, nor a space character, and cannot begin with &quot;-&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, or a numeric digit.
* A single root element contains all the other elements.

The definition of an XML document excludes texts that contain violations of well-formedness rules; they are simply not XML. An XML processor that encounters such a violation is required to report such errors and to cease normal processing. This policy, occasionally referred to as &quot;draconian error handling&quot;, stands in notable contrast to the behavior of programs that process HTML, which are designed to produce a reasonable result even in the presence of severe markup errors. XML&#x27;s policy in this area has been criticized as a violation of Postel&#x27;s law (&quot;Be conservative in what you send; be liberal in what you accept&quot;).

The XML specification defines a valid XML document as a well-formed XML document which also conforms to the rules of a Document Type Definition (DTD).

== Schemas and validation ==
In addition to being well formed, an XML document may be &quot;valid&quot;. This means that it contains a reference to a Document Type Definition (DTD), and that its elements and attributes are declared in that DTD and follow the grammatical rules for them that the DTD specifies.

XML processors are classified as &quot;validating&quot; or &quot;non-validating&quot; depending on whether or not they check XML documents for validity. A processor that discovers a validity error must be able to report it, but may continue normal processing.

A DTD is an example of a &quot;schema&quot; or &quot;grammar&quot;. Since the initial publication of XML 1.0, there has been substantial work in the area of schema languages for XML. Such schema languages typically constrain the set of elements that may be used in a document, which attributes may be applied to them, the order in which they may appear, and the allowable parent/child relationships.

=== Document type definition ===

The oldest schema language for XML is the document type definition (DTD), inherited from SGML.

DTDs have the following benefits:
* DTD support is ubiquitous due to its inclusion in the XML 1.0 standard.
* DTDs are terse compared to element-based schema languages and consequently present more information in a single screen.
* DTDs allow the declaration of standard public entity sets for publishing characters.
* DTDs define a &quot;document type&quot; rather than the types used by a namespace, thus grouping all constraints for a document in a single collection.

DTDs have the following limitations:
* They have no explicit support for newer features of XML, most importantly namespaces.
* They lack expressiveness. XML DTDs are simpler than SGML DTDs and there are certain structures that cannot be expressed with regular grammars. DTDs only support rudimentary datatypes.
* They lack readability. DTD designers typically make heavy use of parameter entities (which behave essentially as textual macros), which make it easier to define complex grammars, but at the expense of clarity.
* They use a syntax based on regular expression syntax, inherited from SGML, to describe the schema. Typical XML APIs such as SAX do not attempt to offer applications a structured representation of the syntax, so it is less accessible to programmers than an element-based syntax may be.

Two peculiar features that distinguish DTDs from other schema types are the syntactic support for embedding a DTD within XML documents and for defining &quot;entities&quot;, which are arbitrary fragments of text or markup that the XML processor inserts in the DTD itself and in the XML document wherever they are referenced, like character escapes.

DTD technology is still used in many applications because of its ubiquity.

=== Schema ===
A newer schema language, described by the W3C as the successor of DTDs, is XML Schema, often referred to by the initialism for XML Schema instances, XSD (XML Schema Definition). XSDs are far more powerful than DTDs in describing XML languages. They use a rich datatyping system and allow for more detailed constraints on an XML document&#x27;s logical structure. XSDs also use an XML-based format, which makes it possible to use ordinary XML tools to help process them.

xs:schema element that defines a schema:

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;xs:schema xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;&gt;&lt;/xs:schema&gt;
=== RELAX NG ===
RELAX NG (Regular Language for XML Next Generation) was initially specified by OASIS and is now a standard (Part 2: &quot;Regular-grammar-based validation&quot; of ISO/IEC 19757 – DSDL). RELAX NG schemas may be written in either an XML based syntax or a more compact non-XML syntax; the two syntaxes are isomorphic and James Clark&#x27;s conversion tool—Trang—can convert between them without loss of information. RELAX NG has a simpler definition and validation framework than XML Schema, making it easier to use and implement. It also has the ability to use datatype framework plug-ins; a RELAX NG schema author, for example, can require values in an XML document to conform to definitions in XML Schema Datatypes.

=== Schematron ===
Schematron is a language for making assertions about the presence or absence of patterns in an XML document. It typically uses XPath expressions. Schematron is now a standard (Part 3: &quot;Rule-based validation&quot; of ISO/IEC 19757 – DSDL).

=== DSDL and other schema languages ===
DSDL (Document Schema Definition Languages) is a multi-part ISO/IEC standard (ISO/IEC 19757) that brings together a comprehensive set of small schema languages, each targeted at specific problems. DSDL includes RELAX NG full and compact syntax, Schematron assertion language, and languages for defining datatypes, character repertoire constraints, renaming and entity expansion, and namespace-based routing of document fragments to different validators. DSDL schema languages do not have the vendor support of XML Schemas yet, and are to some extent a grassroots reaction of industrial publishers to the lack of utility of XML Schemas for publishing.

Some schema languages not only describe the structure of a particular XML format but also offer limited facilities to influence processing of individual XML files that conform to this format. DTDs and XSDs both have this ability; they can for instance provide the infoset augmentation facility and attribute defaults. RELAX NG and Schematron intentionally do not provide these.

== Related specifications ==
A cluster of specifications closely related to XML have been developed, starting soon after the initial publication of XML 1.0. It is frequently the case that the term &quot;XML&quot; is used to refer to XML together with one or more of these other technologies that have come to be seen as part of the XML core.
* XML namespaces enable the same document to contain XML elements and attributes taken from different vocabularies, without any naming collisions occurring. Although XML Namespaces are not part of the XML specification itself, virtually all XML software also supports XML Namespaces.
* XML Base defines the codice_45 attribute, which may be used to set the base for resolution of relative URI references within the scope of a single XML element.
* XML Information Set or XML Infoset is an abstract data model for XML documents in terms of &quot;information items&quot;. The infoset is commonly used in the specifications of XML languages, for convenience in describing constraints on the XML constructs those languages allow.
* XSL (Extensible Stylesheet Language) is a family of languages used to transform and render XML documents, split into three parts:
** XSLT (XSL Transformations), an XML language for transforming XML documents into other XML documents or other formats such as HTML, plain text, or XSL-FO. XSLT is very tightly coupled with XPath, which it uses to address components of the input XML document, mainly elements and attributes.
** XSL-FO (XSL Formatting Objects), an XML language for rendering XML documents, often used to generate PDFs.
** XPath (XML Path Language), a non-XML language for addressing the components (elements, attributes, and so on) of an XML document. XPath is widely used in other core-XML specifications and in programming libraries for accessing XML-encoded data.
* XQuery (XML Query) is an XML query language strongly rooted in XPath and XML Schema. It provides methods to access, manipulate and return XML, and is mainly conceived as a query language for XML databases.
* XML Signature defines syntax and processing rules for creating digital signatures on XML content.
* XML Encryption defines syntax and processing rules for encrypting XML content.
* XML model (Part 11: &quot;Schema Association&quot; of ISO/IEC 19757 – DSDL) defines a means of associating any xml document with any of the schema types mentioned above.

Some other specifications conceived as part of the &quot;XML Core&quot; have failed to find wide adoption, including XInclude, XLink, and XPointer.

== Programming interfaces ==
The design goals of XML include, &quot;It shall be easy to write programs which process XML documents.&quot; Despite this, the XML specification contains almost no information about how programmers might go about doing such processing. The XML Infoset specification provides a vocabulary to refer to the constructs within an XML document, but does not provide any guidance on how to access this information. A variety of APIs for accessing XML have been developed and used, and some have been standardized.

Existing APIs for XML processing tend to fall into these categories:
* Stream-oriented APIs accessible from a programming language, for example SAX and StAX.
* Tree-traversal APIs accessible from a programming language, for example DOM.
* XML data binding, which provides an automated translation between an XML document and programming-language objects.
* Declarative transformation languages such as XSLT and XQuery.
* Syntax extensions to general-purpose programming languages, for example LINQ and Scala.

Stream-oriented facilities require less memory and, for certain tasks based on a linear traversal of an XML document, are faster and simpler than other alternatives. Tree-traversal and data-binding APIs typically require the use of much more memory, but are often found more convenient for use by programmers; some include declarative retrieval of document components via the use of XPath expressions.

XSLT is designed for declarative description of XML document transformations, and has been widely implemented both in server-side packages and Web browsers. XQuery overlaps XSLT in its functionality, but is designed more for searching of large XML databases.

=== Simple API for XML ===
Simple API for XML (SAX) is a lexical, event-driven API in which a document is read serially and its contents are reported as callbacks to various methods on a handler object of the user&#x27;s design. SAX is fast and efficient to implement, but difficult to use for extracting information at random from the XML, since it tends to burden the application author with keeping track of what part of the document is being processed. It is better suited to situations in which certain types of information are always handled the same way, no matter where they occur in the document.

=== Pull parsing ===
Pull parsing treats the document as a series of items read in sequence using the iterator design pattern. This allows for writing of recursive descent parsers in which the structure of the code performing the parsing mirrors the structure of the XML being parsed, and intermediate parsed results can be used and accessed as local variables within the functions performing the parsing, or passed down (as function parameters) into lower-level functions, or returned (as function return values) to higher-level functions. Examples of pull parsers include Data::Edit::Xml in Perl, StAX in the Java programming language, XMLPullParser in Smalltalk, XMLReader in PHP, ElementTree.iterparse in Python, SmartXML in Red, System.Xml.XmlReader in the .NET Framework, and the DOM traversal API (NodeIterator and TreeWalker).

A pull parser creates an iterator that sequentially visits the various elements, attributes, and data in an XML document. Code that uses this iterator can test the current item (to tell, for example, whether it is a start-tag or end-tag, or text), and inspect its attributes (local name, namespace, values of XML attributes, value of text, etc.), and can also move the iterator to the next item. The code can thus extract information from the document as it traverses it. The recursive-descent approach tends to lend itself to keeping data as typed local variables in the code doing the parsing, while SAX, for instance, typically requires a parser to manually maintain intermediate data within a stack of elements that are parent elements of the element being parsed. Pull-parsing code can be more straightforward to understand and maintain than SAX parsing code.

=== Document Object Model ===
The Document Object Model (DOM) is an interface that allows for navigation of the entire document as if it were a tree of node objects representing the document&#x27;s contents. A DOM document can be created by a parser, or can be generated manually by users (with limitations). Data types in DOM nodes are abstract; implementations provide their own programming language-specific bindings. DOM implementations tend to be memory intensive, as they generally require the entire document to be loaded into memory and constructed as a tree of objects before access is allowed.

=== Data binding ===
XML data binding is a technique for simplifying development of applications that need to work with XML documents. It involves mapping the XML document to a hierarchy of strongly typed objects, rather than using the generic objects created by a DOM parser. The resulting code is often easier to read and maintain, and it can help to identify problems at compile time rather than run-time. XML data binding is particularly well-suited for applications where the document structure is known and fixed at the time the application is written. By creating a strongly typed representation of the XML data, developers can take advantage of modern integrated development environments (IDEs) that provide features like auto-complete, code refactoring, and code highlighting. This can make it easier to write correct and efficient code, and reduce the risk of errors and bugs. Example data-binding systems include the Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB), XML Serialization in .NET Framework, and XML serialization in gSOAP.

=== XML as data type ===
XML has appeared as a first-class data type in other languages. The ECMAScript for XML (E4X) extension to the ECMAScript/JavaScript language explicitly defines two specific objects (XML and XMLList) for JavaScript, which support XML document nodes and XML node lists as distinct objects and use a dot-notation specifying parent-child relationships. E4X is supported by the Mozilla 2.5+ browsers (though now deprecated) and Adobe Actionscript but has not been widely adopted. Similar notations are used in Microsoft&#x27;s LINQ implementation for Microsoft .NET 3.5 and above, and in Scala (which uses the Java VM). The open-source xmlsh application, which provides a Linux-like shell with special features for XML manipulation, similarly treats XML as a data type, using the &lt;[ ]&gt; notation. The Resource Description Framework defines a data type codice_46 to hold wrapped, canonical XML. Facebook has produced extensions to the PHP and JavaScript languages that add XML to the core syntax in a similar fashion to E4X, namely XHP and JSX respectively.

== History ==
XML is an application profile of SGML (ISO 8879).

The versatility of SGML for dynamic information display was understood by early digital media publishers in the late 1980s prior to the rise of the Internet. By the mid-1990s some practitioners of SGML had gained experience with the then-new World Wide Web, and believed that SGML offered solutions to some of the problems the Web was likely to face as it grew. Dan Connolly added SGML to the list of W3C&#x27;s activities when he joined the staff in 1995; work began in mid-1996 when Sun Microsystems engineer Jon Bosak developed a charter and recruited collaborators. Bosak was well-connected in the small community of people who had experience both in SGML and the Web.

XML was compiled by a working group of eleven members, supported by a (roughly) 150-member Interest Group. Technical debate took place on the Interest Group mailing list and issues were resolved by consensus or, when that failed, majority vote of the Working Group. A record of design decisions and their rationales was compiled by Michael Sperberg-McQueen on December 4, 1997. James Clark served as Technical Lead of the Working Group, notably contributing the empty-element codice_47 syntax and the name &quot;XML&quot;. Other names that had been put forward for consideration included &quot;MAGMA&quot; (Minimal Architecture for Generalized Markup Applications), &quot;SLIM&quot; (Structured Language for Internet Markup) and &quot;MGML&quot; (Minimal Generalized Markup Language). The co-editors of the specification were originally Tim Bray and Michael Sperberg-McQueen. Halfway through the project, Bray accepted a consulting engagement with Netscape, provoking vociferous protests from Microsoft. Bray was temporarily asked to resign the editorship. This led to intense dispute in the Working Group, eventually solved by the appointment of Microsoft&#x27;s Jean Paoli as a third co-editor.

The XML Working Group communicated primarily through email and weekly teleconferences. The major design decisions were reached in a short burst of intense work between August and November 1996, when the first Working Draft of an XML specification was published. Further design work continued through 1997, and XML 1.0 became a W3C Recommendation on February 10, 1998.

=== Sources ===
XML is a profile of an ISO standard, SGML, and most of XML comes from SGML unchanged. From SGML comes the separation of logical and physical structures (elements and entities), the availability of grammar-based validation (DTDs), the separation of data and metadata (elements and attributes), mixed content, the separation of processing from representation (processing instructions), and the default angle-bracket syntax. The SGML declaration was removed; thus, XML has a fixed delimiter set and adopts Unicode as the document character set.

Other sources of technology for XML were the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative), which defined a profile of SGML for use as a &quot;transfer syntax&quot; and HTML. The ERCS (Extended Reference Concrete Syntax) project of the SPREAD (Standardization Project Regarding East Asian Documents) project of the ISO-related China/Japan/Korea Document Processing expert group was the basis of XML 1.0&#x27;s naming rules; SPREAD also introduced hexadecimal numeric character references and the concept of references to make available all Unicode characters. To support ERCS, XML and HTML better, the SGML standard IS 8879 was revised in 1996 and 1998 with WebSGML Adaptations.

Ideas that developed during discussion that are novel in XML included the algorithm for encoding detection and the encoding header, the processing instruction target, the xml:space attribute, and the new close delimiter for empty-element tags. The notion of well-formedness as opposed to validity (which enables parsing without a schema) was first formalized in XML, although it had been implemented successfully in the Electronic Book Technology &quot;Dynatext&quot; software; the software from the University of Waterloo New Oxford English Dictionary Project; the RISP LISP SGML text processor at Uniscope, Tokyo; the US Army Missile Command IADS hypertext system; Mentor Graphics Context; Interleaf and Xerox Publishing System.

== Versions ==
=== 1.0 and 1.1 ===
The first (XML 1.0) was initially defined in 1998. It has undergone minor revisions since then, without being given a new version number, and is currently in its fifth edition, as published on November 26, 2008. It is widely implemented and still recommended for general use.

The second (XML 1.1) was initially published on February 4, 2004, the same day as XML 1.0 Third Edition, and is currently in its second edition, as published on August 16, 2006. It contains features (some contentious) that are intended to make XML easier to use in certain cases. The main changes are to enable the use of line-ending characters used on EBCDIC platforms, and the use of scripts and characters absent from Unicode 3.2. XML 1.1 is not very widely implemented and is recommended for use only by those who need its particular features.

Prior to its fifth edition release, XML 1.0 differed from XML 1.1 in having stricter requirements for characters available for use in element and attribute names and unique identifiers: in the first four editions of XML 1.0 the characters were exclusively enumerated using a specific version of the Unicode standard (Unicode 2.0 to Unicode 3.2.) The fifth edition substitutes the mechanism of XML 1.1, which is more future-proof but reduces redundancy. The approach taken in the fifth edition of XML 1.0 and in all editions of XML 1.1 is that only certain characters are forbidden in names, and everything else is allowed to accommodate suitable name characters in future Unicode versions. In the fifth edition, XML names may contain characters in the Balinese, Cham, or Phoenician scripts among many others added to Unicode since Unicode 3.2.

Almost any Unicode code point can be used in the character data and attribute values of an XML 1.0/1.1 document, even if the character corresponding to the code point is not defined in the current version of Unicode. In character data and attribute values, XML 1.1 allows the use of more control characters than XML 1.0, but, for &quot;robustness&quot;, most of the control characters introduced in XML 1.1 must be expressed as numeric character references (and #x7F through #x9F, which had been allowed in XML 1.0, are in XML 1.1 even required to be expressed as numeric character references). Among the supported control characters in XML 1.1 are two line break codes that must be treated as whitespace characters, which are the only control codes that can be written directly.

=== 2.0 ===
There has been discussion of an XML 2.0, although no organization has announced plans for work on such a project. XML-SW (SW for skunkworks), which one of the original developers of XML has written, contains some proposals for what an XML 2.0 might look like, including elimination of DTDs from syntax, as well as integration of XML namespaces, XML Base and XML Information Set into the base standard.

=== MicroXML ===
In 2012, James Clark (technical lead of the XML Working Group) and John Cowan (editor of the XML 1.1 specification) formed the MicroXML Community Group within the W3C and published a specification for a significantly reduced subset of XML.

=== Binary XML ===
The World Wide Web Consortium also has an XML Binary Characterization Working Group doing preliminary research into use cases and properties for a binary encoding of XML Information Set. The working group is not chartered to produce any official standards. Since XML is by definition text-based, ITU-T and ISO are using the name Fast Infoset for their own binary format (ITU-T Rec. X.891 and ISO/IEC 24824-1) to avoid confusion.

== Criticism ==
XML and its extensions have regularly been criticized for verbosity, complexity and redundancy.

Mapping the basic tree model of XML to type systems of programming languages or databases can be difficult, especially when XML is used for exchanging highly structured data between applications, which was not its primary design goal. However, XML data binding systems allow applications to access XML data directly from objects representing a data structure of the data in the programming language used, which ensures type safety, rather than using the DOM or SAX to retrieve data from a direct representation of the XML itself. This is accomplished by automatically creating a mapping between elements of the XML schema XSD of the document and members of a class to be represented in memory.

Other criticisms attempt to refute the claim that XML is a self-describing language (though the XML specification itself makes no such claim).

JSON, YAML, and S-Expressions are frequently proposed as simpler alternatives (see Comparison of data-serialization formats) that focus on representing highly structured data rather than documents, which may contain both highly structured and relatively unstructured content. However, W3C-standardized XML schema specifications offer a broader range of structured XSD data types compared to simpler serialization formats and offer modularity and reuse through XML namespaces.
