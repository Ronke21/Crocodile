<text>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus &quot;Panthera&quot;, native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion&#x27;s pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized and large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator.

The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia, from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.

One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in literature and films. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions of lions have occurred worldwide, particularly has a symbol of power and royalty.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;lion&quot; is derived via Anglo-Norman from Latin (nominative: ), which in turn was a borrowing from Ancient Greek . The Hebrew word may also be related. The generic name &quot;Panthera&quot; is traceable to the classical Latin word &#x27;panthēra&#x27; and the ancient Greek word πάνθηρ &#x27;panther&#x27;.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Felis leo&quot; was the scientific name used by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, who described the lion in his work &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The genus name &quot;Panthera&quot; was coined by Lorenz Oken in 1816. Between the mid-18th and mid-20th centuries, 26 lion specimens were described and proposed as subspecies, of which 11 were recognised as valid in 2005. They were distinguished mostly by the size and colour of their manes and skins.

===Subspecies===
In the 19th and 20th centuries, several lion type specimens were described and proposed as subspecies, with about a dozen recognised as valid taxa until 2017. Between 2008 and 2016, IUCN Red List assessors used only two subspecific names: &quot;P. l. leo&quot; for African lion populations, and &quot;P. l. persica&quot; for the Asiatic lion population. In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group revised lion taxonomy, and recognises two subspecies based on results of several phylogeographic studies on lion evolution, namely:

*&quot;P. l. leo&quot; − the nominate lion subspecies includes the Asiatic lion, the regionally extinct Barbary lion, and lion populations in West and northern parts of Central Africa. Synonyms include &quot;P. l. persica&quot; , &quot;P. l. senegalensis&quot; , &quot;P. l. kamptzi&quot; , and &quot;P. l. azandica&quot; . Multiple authors referred to it as &#x27;northern lion&#x27; and &#x27;northern subspecies&#x27;.
*&quot;P. l. melanochaita&quot; − includes the extinct Cape lion and lion populations in East and Southern African regions. Synonyms include &quot;P. l. somaliensis&quot; , &quot;P. l. massaica&quot; , &quot;P. l. sabakiensis&quot; , &quot;P. l. bleyenberghi&quot; , &quot;P. l. roosevelti&quot; , &quot;P. l. nyanzae&quot; , &quot;P. l. hollisteri&quot; , &quot;P. l. krugeri&quot; , &quot;P. l. vernayi&quot; , and &quot;P. l. webbiensis&quot; . It has been referred to as &#x27;southern subspecies&#x27; and &#x27;southern lion&#x27;.

However, there seems to be some degree of overlap between both groups in northern Central Africa. DNA analysis from a more recent study indicates that Central African lions are derived from both northern and southern lions, as they cluster with &quot;P. leo leo&quot; in mtDNA-based phylogenies whereas their genomic DNA indicates a closer relationship with P. &quot;leo melanochaita&quot;.

Lion samples from some parts of the Ethiopian Highlands cluster genetically with those from Cameroon and Chad, while lions from other areas of Ethiopia cluster with samples from East Africa. Researchers, therefore, assume Ethiopia is a contact zone between the two subspecies. Genome-wide data of a wild-born historical lion sample from Sudan showed that it clustered with &quot;P. l. leo&quot; in mtDNA-based phylogenies, but with a high affinity to &quot;P. l. melanochaita&quot;. This result suggested that the taxonomic position of lions in Central Africa may require revision.

===Fossil records===
Other lion subspecies or sister species to the modern lion existed in prehistoric times:
*&quot;P. l. sinhaleyus&quot; was a fossil carnassial excavated in Sri Lanka, which was attributed to a lion. It is thought to have become extinct around 39,000 years ago.
*&quot;P. fossilis&quot; was larger than the modern lion and lived in the Middle Pleistocene. Bone fragments were excavated in caves in the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and Czech Republic.
*&quot;P. spelaea&quot;, or the cave lion, lived in Eurasia and Beringia during the Late Pleistocene. It became extinct due to climate warming or human expansion latest by 11,900 years ago. Bone fragments excavated in European, North Asian, Canadian and Alaskan caves indicate that it ranged from Europe across Siberia into western Alaska. It likely derived from &quot;P. fossilis&quot;, and was genetically isolated and highly distinct from the modern lion in Africa and Eurasia. It is depicted in Paleolithic cave paintings, ivory carvings, and clay busts.
*&quot;P. atrox&quot;, or the American lion, ranged in the Americas from Canada to possibly Patagonia during the Late Pleistocene. It diverged from the cave lion around 165,000 years ago. A fossil from Edmonton dates to 11,355 ± 55 years ago.

===Evolution===
The &quot;Panthera&quot; lineage is estimated to have genetically diverged from the common ancestor of the Felidae around to . Results of analyses differ in the phylogenetic relationship of the lion; it was thought to form a sister group with the jaguar that diverged , but also with the leopard that diverged to . Hybridisation between lion and snow leopard ancestors possibly continued until about 2.1 million years ago. The lion-leopard clade was distributed in the Asian and African Palearctic since at least the early Pliocene. The earliest fossils recognisable as lions were found at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania and are estimated to be up to 2 million years old.

Estimates for the divergence time of the modern and cave lion lineages range from 529,000 to 392,000 years ago based on mutation rate per generation time of the modern lion. There is no evidence for gene flow between the two lineages, indicating that they did not share the same geographic area. The Eurasian and American cave lions became extinct at the end of the last glacial period without mitochondrial descendants on other continents. The modern lion was probably widely distributed in Africa during the Middle Pleistocene and started to diverge in sub-Saharan Africa during the Late Pleistocene. Lion populations in East and Southern Africa became separated from populations in West and North Africa when the equatorial rainforest expanded 183,500 to 81,800 years ago. They shared a common ancestor probably between 98,000 and 52,000 years ago. Due to the expansion of the Sahara between 83,100 and 26,600 years ago, lion populations in West and North Africa became separated. As the rainforest decreased and thus gave rise to more open habitats, lions moved from West to Central Africa. Lions from North Africa dispersed to southern Europe and Asia between 38,800 and 8,300 years ago.

Extinction of lions in southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East interrupted gene flow between lion populations in Asia and Africa. Genetic evidence revealed numerous mutations in lion samples from East and Southern Africa, which indicates that this group has a longer evolutionary history than genetically less diverse lion samples from Asia and West and Central Africa. A whole genome-wide sequence of lion samples showed that samples from West Africa shared alleles with samples from Southern Africa, and samples from Central Africa shared alleles with samples from Asia. This phenomenon indicates that Central Africa was a melting pot of lion populations after they had become isolated, possibly migrating through corridors in the Nile Basin during the early Holocene.

===Hybrids===

In zoos, lions have been bred with tigers to create hybrids for the curiosity of visitors or for scientific purpose. The liger is bigger than a lion and a tiger, whereas most tigons are relatively small compared to their parents because of reciprocal gene effects. The leopon is a hybrid between a lion and leopard.

==Description==
The lion is a muscular, broad-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck, and round ears; males have broader heads. The fur varies in colour from light buff to silvery grey, yellowish red, and dark brown. The colours of the underparts are generally lighter. A new-born lion has dark spots, which fade as the cub reaches adulthood, although faint spots may still be seen on the legs and underparts. The tail of all lions ends in a dark, hairy tuft that, in some lions, conceals an approximately -long, hard &quot;spine&quot; or &quot;spur&quot; composed of dermal papillae. The functions of the spur are unknown. The tuft is absent at birth and develops at around months of age. It is readily identifiable at the age of seven months.

Its skull is very similar to that of the tiger, although the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened and has a slightly shorter postorbital region and broader nasal openings than those of the tiger. Due to the amount of skull variation in the two species, usually only the structure of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species.

The skeletal muscles of the lion make up 58.8% of its body weight and represent the highest percentage of muscles among mammals. The lion has a high concentration of fast twitch muscle fibres, giving them quick bursts of speed but less stamina. 

===Size===
Among felids, the lion is second only to the tiger in size. The size and weight of adult lions vary across its range and habitats. Accounts of a few individuals that were larger than average exist from Africa and India.

===Mane===

The male lion&#x27;s mane is the most recognisable feature of the species. It may have evolved around 320,000–190,000 years ago. It grows downwards and backwards, covering most of the head, neck, shoulders, and chest. The mane is typically brownish and tinged with yellow, rust, and black hairs. Mutations in the genes microphthalmia-associated transcription factor and tyrosinase are possibly responsible for the colour of manes. It starts growing when lions enter adolescence, when testosterone levels increase, and reach their full size at around four years old. Cool ambient temperatures in European and North American zoos may result in a heavier mane. On average, Asiatic lions have sparser manes than African lions.

This feature likely evolved to signal the fitness of males to females. Males with darker manes appear to have greater reproductive success and are more likely to remain in a pride for longer. They have longer and thicker hair and higher testosterone levels, but they are also more vulnerable to heat stress. The core body temperature does apparently not increase regardless of sex, season, feeding time, length and colour of mane, but only surface temperature is affected. Unlike in other felid species, female lions consistently interact with multiple males at once. Another hypothesis suggests that the mane also serves to protect the neck in fights, but this is disputed. During fights, including those involving maneless females and adolescents, the neck is not targeted as much as the face, back, and hindquarters. Injured lions also begin to lose their manes. 

Almost all male lions in Pendjari National Park are either maneless or have very short manes. Maneless lions have also been reported in Senegal, in Sudan&#x27;s Dinder National Park and in Tsavo East National Park, Kenya. Castrated lions often have little to no mane because the removal of the gonads inhibits testosterone production. Rarely, both wild and captive lionesses have manes. Increased testosterone may be the cause of maned lionesses reported in northern Botswana.

===Colour variation===

The white lion is a rare morph with a genetic condition called leucism, which is caused by a double recessive allele. It is not albino; it has normal pigmentation in the eyes and skin. White lions have occasionally been encountered in and around Kruger National Park and the adjacent Timbavati Private Game Reserve in eastern South Africa. They were removed from the wild in the 1970s, thus decreasing the white lion gene pool. Nevertheless, 17 births have been recorded in five prides between 2007 and 2015. White lions are selected for breeding in captivity. They have reportedly been bred in camps in South Africa for use as trophies to be killed during canned hunts.

==Distribution and habitat==

African lions live in scattered populations across sub-Saharan Africa. The lion prefers grassy plains and savannahs, scrub bordering rivers, and open woodlands with bushes. It rarely enters closed forests. On Mount Elgon, the lion has been recorded up to an elevation of and close to the snow line on Mount Kenya. Savannahs with an annual rainfall of make up the majority of lion habitat in Africa, estimated at at most, but remnant populations are also present in tropical moist forests in West Africa and montane forests in East Africa. The Asiatic lion now survives only in and around Gir National Park in Gujarat, western India. Its habitat is a mixture of dry savannah forest and very dry, deciduous scrub forest.

===Historical range===
In Africa, the range of the lion originally spanned most of the central African rainforest zone and the Sahara desert. In the 1960s, it became extinct in North Africa, except in the southern part of Sudan.

During the mid-Holocene, around 8,000-6,000 years ago, the range of lions expanded into Southeastern and Eastern Europe, partially re-occupying the range of the now extinct cave lion. In Hungary, the modern lion was present from about 4,500 to 3,200 years Before Present. In Ukraine, the modern lion was present from about 6,400 to 2,000 years Before Present. In Greece, it was common, as reported by Herodotus in 480 BC; it was considered rare by 300 BC and extirpated by AD 100.

In Asia the lion once ranged in regions where climatic conditions supported an abundance of prey. It was present in the Caucasus until the 10th century. It lived in Palestine until the Middle Ages and in Southwest Asia until the late 19th century. By the late 19th century, it had been extirpated in most of Turkey. The last live lion in Iran was sighted in 1942, about northwest of Dezful, although the corpse of a lioness was found on the banks of the Karun river in Khuzestan province in 1944. It once ranged from Sind and Punjab in Pakistan to Bengal and the Narmada River in central India.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Lions spend much of their time resting; they are inactive for about twenty hours per day. Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socialising, grooming, and defecating. Intermittent bursts of activity continue until dawn, when hunting most often takes place. They spend an average of two hours a day walking and fifty minutes eating.

===Group organisation===

The lion is the most social of all wild felid species, living in groups of related individuals with their offspring. Such a group is called a &quot;pride&quot;. Groups of male lions are called &quot;coalitions&quot;. Females form the stable social unit in a pride and do not tolerate outside females. The majority of females remain in their birth prides while all males and some females will disperse. The average pride consists of around 15 lions, including several adult females and up to four males and their cubs of both sexes. Large prides, consisting of up to 30 individuals, have been observed. The sole exception to this pattern is the Tsavo lion pride that always has just one adult male. Prides act as fission–fusion societies, and members will split into subgroups that keep in contact with roars.

Nomadic lions range widely and move around sporadically, either in pairs or alone. Pairs are more frequent among related males. A lion may switch lifestyles; nomads can become residents and vice versa. Interactions between prides and nomads tend to be hostile, although pride females in estrus allow nomadic males to approach them. Males spend years in a nomadic phase before gaining residence in a pride. A study undertaken in the Serengeti National Park revealed that nomadic coalitions gain residency at between 3.5 and 7.3 years of age. In Kruger National Park, dispersing male lions move more than away from their natal pride in search of their own territory. Female lions stay closer to their natal pride. Therefore, female lions in an area are more closely related to each other than male lions in the same area.

The evolution of sociability in lions was likely driven both by high population density and the clumped resources of savannah habitats. The larger the pride, the more high-quality territory they can defend; &quot;hotspots&quot; being near river confluences, where the cats have better access to water, prey and shelter (via vegetation). The area occupied by a pride is called a &quot;pride area&quot; whereas that occupied by a nomad is a &quot;range&quot;. Males associated with a pride patrol the fringes. Both males and females defend the pride against intruders, but the male lion is better-suited for this purpose due to its stockier, more powerful build. Some individuals consistently lead the defence against intruders, while others lag behind. Lions tend to assume specific roles in the pride; slower-moving individuals may provide other valuable services to the group. Alternatively, there may be rewards associated with being a leader that fends off intruders; the rank of lionesses in the pride is reflected in these responses. The male or males associated with the pride must defend their relationship with the pride from outside males who may attempt to usurp them. Dominance hierarchies do not appear to exist among individuals of either sex in a pride.

Asiatic lion prides differ in group composition. Male Asiatic lions are solitary or associate with up to three males, forming a loose pride while females associate with up to 12 other females, forming a stronger pride together with their cubs. Female and male lions associate only when mating. Coalitions of males hold territory for a longer time than single lions. Males in coalitions of three or four individuals exhibit a pronounced hierarchy, in which one male dominates the others and mates more frequently.

===Hunting and diet===
The lion is a generalist hypercarnivore and is considered to be both an apex and keystone predator due to its wide prey spectrum. Its prey consists mainly of medium-sized to large ungulates, particularly blue wildebeest, plains zebra, African buffalo, gemsbok and giraffe. It also frequently takes common warthog despite it being much smaller. In India, chital and sambar deer are the most common wild prey, while livestock contributes significantly to lion kills outside protected areas. It usually avoids fully grown adult elephants, rhinoceros and hippopotamus and small prey like dik-dik, hyraxes, hares and monkeys. Unusual prey include porcupines and small reptiles. Lions kill other predators but seldom consume them.

Young lions first display stalking behaviour at around three months of age, although they do not participate in hunting until they are almost a year old and begin to hunt effectively when nearing the age of two. Single lions are capable of bringing down zebra and wildebeest, while larger prey like buffalo and giraffe are riskier. In Chobe National Park, large prides have been observed hunting African bush elephants up to around 15 years old in exceptional cases, with the victims being calves, juveniles, and even subadults. In typical group hunts, each lioness has a favoured position in the group, either stalking prey on the &quot;wing&quot;, then attacking, or moving a smaller distance in the centre of the group and capturing prey fleeing from other lionesses. Males attached to prides do not usually participate in group hunting.
Some evidence suggests, however, that males are just as successful as females; they are typically solo hunters who ambush prey in small bushland. They may join in the hunting of large, slower-moving prey like buffalo; and even hunt them on their own. Moderately-sized hunting groups generally have higher success rates than lone females and larger groups.

Lions are not particularly known for their stamina. For instance, a lioness&#x27;s heart comprises only 0.57% of her body weight and a male&#x27;s is about 0.45% of his body weight, whereas a hyena&#x27;s heart comprises almost 1% of its body weight. Thus, lions run quickly only in short bursts at about and need to be close to their prey before starting the attack. They take advantage of factors that reduce visibility; many kills take place near some form of cover or at night. One study in 2018 recorded a lion running at a top speed of . The lion accelerates at the start of the chase by , whereas zebras, wildebeest and Thomson&#x27;s gazelle accelerate by , and respectively; acceleration appears to be more important than steady displacement speed in lion hunts. The lion&#x27;s attack is short and powerful; it attempts to catch prey with a fast rush and final leap, usually pulls it down by the rump, and kills with a clamping bite to the throat or muzzle. It can hold the prey&#x27;s throat for up to 13 minutes, until the prey stops moving. It has a bite force from 1593.8 to 1768 Newtons at the canine tip and up 4167.6 Newtons at the carnassial notch. 

Lions typically consume prey at the location of the hunt but sometimes drag large prey into cover. They tend to squabble over kills, particularly the males. Cubs suffer most when food is scarce but otherwise all pride members eat their fill, including old and crippled lions, which can live on leftovers. Large kills are shared more widely among pride members. An adult lioness requires an average of about of meat per day while males require about . Lions gorge themselves and eat up to in one session. If it is unable to consume all of the kill, it rests for a few hours before continuing to eat. On hot days, the pride retreats to shade with one or two males standing guard. Lions defend their kills from scavengers such as vultures and hyenas.

Lions scavenge on carrion when the opportunity arises, scavenging animals dead from natural causes such as disease or those that were killed by other predators. Scavenging lions keep a constant lookout for circling vultures, which indicate the death or distress of an animal. Most carrion on which both hyenas and lions feed upon are killed by hyenas rather than lions. Carrion is thought to provide a large part of lion diet.

===Predatory competition===
Lions and spotted hyenas occupy a similar ecological niche and compete for prey and carrion; a review of data across several studies indicates a dietary overlap of 58.6%. Lions typically ignore hyenas unless they are on a kill or are being harassed, while the latter tend to visibly react to the presence of lions with or without the presence of food. In the Ngorongoro crater, lions subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas, causing them to increase their kill rate. In Botswana&#x27;s Chobe National Park, the situation is reversed as hyenas there frequently challenge lions and steal their kills, obtaining food from 63% of all lion kills. When confronted on a kill, hyenas may either leave or wait patiently at a distance of until the lions have finished. Hyenas may feed alongside lions and force them off a kill. The two species attack one another even when there is no food involved for no apparent reason. Lions can account for up to 71% of hyena deaths in Etosha National Park. Hyenas have adapted by frequently mobbing lions that enter their home ranges. When the lion population in Kenya&#x27;s Masai Mara National Reserve declined, the spotted hyena population increased rapidly.

Lions tend to dominate cheetahs and leopards, steal their kills and kill their cubs and even adults when given the chance. Cheetahs often lose their kills to lions or other predators. A study in the Serengeti ecosystem revealed that lions killed at least 17 of 125 cheetah cubs born between 1987 and 1990. Cheetahs avoid their competitors by hunting at different times and habitats. Leopards, by contrast, do not appear to be motivated by an avoidance of lions, as they use heavy vegetation regardless of whether lions are present in an area and both cats are active around the same time of day. In addition, there is no evidence that lions affect leopard abundance. Leopards take refuge in trees, though lionesses occasionally attempt to climb up and retrieve their kills.

Lions similarly dominate African wild dogs, taking their kills and dispatching pups or adult dogs. Population densities of wild dogs are low in areas where lions are more abundant. However, there are a few reported cases of old and wounded lions falling prey to wild dogs.

===Reproduction and life cycle===

Most lionesses reproduce by the time they are four years of age. Lions do not mate at a specific time of year and the females are polyestrous. Like those of other cats, the male lion&#x27;s penis has spines that point backward. During withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female&#x27;s vagina, which may cause ovulation. A lioness may mate with more than one male when she is in heat. Lions of both sexes may be involved in group homosexual and courtship activities. Males will also head-rub and roll around with each other before mounting each other. Generation length of the lion is about seven years. The average gestation period is around 110days; the female gives birth to a litter of between one and four cubs in a secluded den, which may be a thicket, a reed-bed, a cave, or some other sheltered area, usually away from the pride. She will often hunt alone while the cubs are still helpless, staying relatively close to the den. Lion cubs are born blind, their eyes opening around seven days after birth. They weigh at birth and are almost helpless, beginning to crawl a day or two after birth and walking around three weeks of age. To avoid a buildup of scent attracting the attention of predators, the lioness moves her cubs to a new den site several times a month, carrying them one-by-one by the nape of the neck.

Usually, the mother does not integrate herself and her cubs back into the pride until the cubs are six to eight weeks old. Sometimes the introduction to pride life occurs earlier, particularly if other lionesses have given birth at about the same time. When first introduced to the rest of the pride, lion cubs lack confidence when confronted with adults other than their mother. They soon begin to immerse themselves in the pride life, however, playing among themselves or attempting to initiate play with the adults. Lionesses with cubs of their own are more likely to be tolerant of another lioness&#x27;s cubs than lionesses without cubs. Male tolerance of the cubs varies—one male could patiently let the cubs play with his tail or his mane, while another may snarl and bat the cubs away.
Pride lionesses often synchronise their reproductive cycles and communal rearing and suckling of the young, which suckle indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the pride. The synchronisation of births is advantageous because the cubs grow to being roughly the same size and have an equal chance of survival, and sucklings are not dominated by older cubs. Weaning occurs after six or seven months. Male lions reach maturity at about three years of age and at four to five years are capable of challenging and displacing adult males associated with another pride. They begin to age and weaken at between 10 and 15 years of age at the latest.

When one or more new males oust the previous males associated with a pride, the victors often kill any existing young cubs, perhaps because females do not become fertile and receptive until their cubs mature or die. Females often fiercely defend their cubs from a usurping male but are rarely successful unless a group of three or four mothers within a pride join forces against the male. Cubs also die from starvation and abandonment, and predation by leopards, hyenas and wild dogs. Male cubs are excluded from their maternal pride when they reach maturity at around two or three years of age, while some females may leave when they reach the age of two. When a new male lion takes over a pride, adolescents both male and female may be evicted.

===Health and mortality===

Lions may live 12–17 years in the wild. Although adult lions have no natural predators, evidence suggests most die violently from attacks by humans or other lions. Lions often inflict serious injuries on members of other prides they encounter in territorial disputes or members of the home pride when fighting at a kill. Crippled lions and cubs may fall victim to hyenas and leopards or be trampled by buffalo or elephants. Careless lions may be maimed when hunting prey. Nile crocodiles may also kill and eat lions, evidenced by the occasional lion claw found in crocodile stomachs.

Ticks commonly infest the ears, neck and groin regions of the lions. Adult forms of several tapeworm species of the genus &quot;Taenia&quot; have been isolated from lion intestines, having been ingested as larvae in antelope meat. Lions in the Ngorongoro Crater were afflicted by an outbreak of stable fly (&quot;Stomoxys calcitrans&quot;) in 1962, resulting in lions becoming emaciated and covered in bloody, bare patches. Lions sought unsuccessfully to evade the biting flies by climbing trees or crawling into hyena burrows; many died or migrated and the local population dropped from 70 to 15 individuals. A more recent outbreak in 2001 killed six lions.

Captive lions have been infected with canine distemper virus (CDV) since at least the mid-1970s. CDV is spread by domestic dogs and other carnivores; a 1994 outbreak in Serengeti National Park resulted in many lions developing neurological symptoms such as seizures. During the outbreak, several lions died from pneumonia and encephalitis. Feline immunodeficiency virus and lentivirus also affect captive lions.

===Communication===
When resting, lion socialisation occurs through a number of behaviours; the animal&#x27;s expressive movements are highly developed. The most common peaceful, tactile gestures are head rubbing and social licking, which have been compared with the role of allogrooming among primates. Head rubbing, nuzzling the forehead, face and neck against another lion appears to be a form of greeting and is seen often after an animal has been apart from others or after a fight or confrontation. Males tend to rub other males, while cubs and females rub females. Social licking often occurs in tandem with head rubbing; it is generally mutual and the recipient appears to express pleasure. The head and neck are the most common parts of the body licked; this behaviour may have arisen out of utility because lions cannot lick these areas themselves.
Lions have an array of facial expressions and body postures that serve as visual gestures. A common facial expression is the &quot;grimace face&quot; or flehmen response, which a lion makes when sniffing chemical signals and involves an open mouth with bared teeth, raised muzzle, wrinkled nose, closed eyes and relaxed ears. Lions also use chemical and visual marking; males spray urine and scrape plots of ground and objects within the territory.

The lion&#x27;s repertoire of vocalisations is large; variations in intensity and pitch appear to be central to communication. Most lion vocalisations are variations of growling, snarling, meowing and roaring. Other sounds produced include puffing, bleating and humming. Roaring is used to advertise its presence. Lions most often roar at night, a sound that can be heard from a distance of . They tend to roar in a very characteristic manner starting with a few deep, long roars that subside into grunts.

==Conservation==
The lion is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. The Indian population is listed on CITES Appendix I and the African population on CITES Appendix II.

===In Africa===
Several large and well-managed protected areas in Africa host large lion populations. Where an infrastructure for wildlife tourism has been developed, cash revenue for park management and local communities is a strong incentive for lion conservation. Most lions now live in East and Southern Africa; their numbers are rapidly decreasing, and fell by an estimated 30–50% in the late half of the 20th century. Primary causes of the decline include disease and human interference. In 1975, it was estimated that since the 1950s, lion numbers had decreased by half to 200,000 or fewer. Estimates of the African lion population range between 16,500 and 47,000 living in the wild in 2002–2004.

In the Republic of the Congo, Odzala-Kokoua National Park was considered a lion stronghold in the 1990s. By 2014, no lions were recorded in the protected area so the population is considered locally extinct. The West African lion population is isolated from the one in Central Africa, with little or no exchange of breeding individuals. In 2015, it was estimated that this population consists of about 400 animals, including fewer than 250 mature individuals. They persist in three protected areas in the region, mostly in one population in the W A P protected area complex, shared by Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger. This population is listed as Critically Endangered. Field surveys in the WAP ecosystem revealed that lion occupancy is lowest in the W National Park, and higher in areas with permanent staff and thus better protection.

A population occurs in Cameroon&#x27;s Waza National Park, where between approximately 14 and 21 animals persisted as of 2009. In addition, 50 to 150 lions are estimated to be present in Burkina Faso&#x27;s Arly-Singou ecosystem. In 2015, an adult male lion and a female lion were sighted in Ghana&#x27;s Mole National Park. These were the first sightings of lions in the country in 39 years. In the same year, a population of up to 200 lions that was previously thought to have been extirpated was filmed in the Alatash National Park, Ethiopia, close to the Sudanese border.

In 2005, Lion Conservation Strategies were developed for West and Central Africa, and or East and Southern Africa. The strategies seek to maintain suitable habitat, ensure a sufficient wild prey base for lions, reduce factors that lead to further fragmentation of populations, and make lion–human coexistence sustainable. Lion depredation on livestock is significantly reduced in areas where herders keep livestock in improved enclosures. Such measures contribute to mitigating human–lion conflict.

===In Asia===

The last refuge of the Asiatic lion population is the Gir National Park and surrounding areas in the region of Saurashtra or Kathiawar Peninsula in Gujarat State, India. The population has risen from approximately 180 lions in 1974 to about 400 in 2010. It is geographically isolated, which can lead to inbreeding and reduced genetic diversity. Since 2008, the Asiatic lion has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. By 2015, the population had grown to 523 individuals inhabiting an area of in Saurashtra. In 2017, about 650 individuals were recorded during the Asiatic Lion Census.

The presence of numerous human settlements close to Gir National Park resulted in conflict between lions, local people and their livestock. Some consider the presence of lions a benefit, as they keep populations of crop damaging herbivores in check.

===Captive breeding===
Lions imported to Europe before the middle of the 19th century were possibly foremost Barbary lions from North Africa, or Cape lions from Southern Africa. Another 11 animals thought to be Barbary lions kept in Addis Ababa Zoo are descendants of animals owned by Emperor Haile Selassie. WildLink International in collaboration with Oxford University launched an ambitious International Barbary Lion Project with the aim of identifying and breeding Barbary lions in captivity for eventual reintroduction into a national park in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. However, a genetic analysis showed that the captive lions at Addis Ababa Zoo were not Barbary lions, but rather closely related to wild lions in Chad and Cameroon.

In 1982, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums started a Species Survival Plan for the Asiatic lion to increase its chances of survival. In 1987, it was found that most lions in North American zoos were hybrids between African and Asiatic lions. Breeding programs need to note origins of the participating animals to avoid cross-breeding different subspecies and thus reducing their conservation value. Captive breeding of lions was halted to eliminate individuals of unknown origin and pedigree. Wild-born lions were imported to American zoos from Africa between 1989 and 1995. Breeding was continued in 1998 in the frame of an African lion Species Survival Plan.

About 77% of the captive lions registered in the International Species Information System in 2006 were of unknown origin; these animals might have carried genes that are extinct in the wild and may therefore be important to the maintenance of the overall genetic variability of the lion.

==Interactions with humans==
===In zoos and circuses===

Lions are part of a group of exotic animals that have been central to zoo exhibits since the late 18th century. Although many modern zoos are more selective about their exhibits, there are more than 1,000 African and 100 Asiatic lions in zoos and wildlife parks around the world. They are considered an ambassador species and are kept for tourism, education and conservation purposes. Lions can live over twenty years in captivity; for example, three sibling lions at the Honolulu Zoo lived to the age of 22 in 2007.

The first European &quot;zoos&quot; spread among noble and royal families in the 13th century, and until the 17th century were called seraglios. At that time, they came to be called menageries, an extension of the cabinet of curiosities. They spread from France and Italy during the Renaissance to the rest of Europe. In England, although the seraglio tradition was less developed, lions were kept at the Tower of London in a seraglio established by King John in the 13th century; this was probably stocked with animals from an earlier menagerie started in 1125 by Henry I at his hunting lodge in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, where according to William of Malmesbury lions had been stocked.

Lions were kept in cramped and squalid conditions at London Zoo until a larger lion house with roomier cages was built in the 1870s. Further changes took place in the early 20th century when Carl Hagenbeck designed enclosures with concrete &quot;rocks&quot;, more open space and a moat instead of bars, more closely resembling a natural habitat. Hagenbeck designed lion enclosures for both Melbourne Zoo and Sydney&#x27;s Taronga Zoo; although his designs were popular, the use of bars and caged enclosures prevailed in many zoos until the 1960s. In the late 20th century, larger, more natural enclosures and the use of wire mesh or laminated glass instead of lowered dens allowed visitors to come closer than ever to the animals; some attractions such as the Cat Forest/Lion Overlook of Oklahoma City Zoological Park placed the den on ground level, higher than visitors.

Lion taming has been part of both established circuses and individual acts such as Siegfried &amp; Roy. The practice began in the early 19th century by Frenchman Henri Martin and American Isaac Van Amburgh, who both toured widely and whose techniques were copied by a number of followers. Martin composed a pantomime titled &quot;Les Lions de Mysore&quot; (&quot;the lions of Mysore&quot;), an idea Amburgh quickly borrowed. These acts eclipsed equestrianism acts as the central display of circus shows and entered public consciousness in the early 20th century with cinema. In demonstrating the superiority of human over animal, lion taming served a purpose similar to animal fights of previous centuries. The ultimate proof of a tamer&#x27;s dominance and control over a lion is demonstrated by the placing of the tamer&#x27;s head in the lion&#x27;s mouth. The now-iconic lion tamer&#x27;s chair was possibly first used by American Clyde Beatty (1903–1965).

===Hunting and games===

Lion hunting has occurred since ancient times and was often a royal tradition, intended to demonstrate the power of the king over nature. Such hunts took place in a reserved area in front of an audience. The monarch was accompanied by his men and controls were put in place to increase their safety and ease of killing. The earliest surviving record of lion hunting is an ancient Egyptian inscription dated circa 1380 BC that mentions Pharaoh Amenhotep III killing 102 lions in ten years &quot;with his own arrows&quot;. The Assyrian emperor Ashurbanipal had one of his lion hunts depicted on a sequence of Assyrian palace reliefs , known as the Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal. Lions were also hunted during the Mughal Empire, where Emperor Jahangir is said to have excelled at it. In Ancient Rome, lions were kept by emperors for hunts, gladiator fights and executions.

The Maasai people have traditionally viewed the killing of lions as a rite of passage. Historically, lions were hunted by individuals, however, due to reduced lion populations, elders discourage solo lion hunts. During the European colonisation of Africa in the 19th century, the hunting of lions was encouraged because they were considered pests and lion skins were sold for £1 each. The widely reproduced imagery of the heroic hunter chasing lions would dominate a large part of the century. Trophy hunting of lions in recent years has been met with controversy, notably with the killing of Cecil the lion in mid-2015.

===Man-eating===
Lions do not usually hunt humans but some (usually males) seem to seek them out. One well-publicised case is the Tsavo maneaters; in 1898, 28 officially recorded workers building the Uganda Railway were taken by lions over nine months during the construction of a bridge in Kenya. The hunter who killed the lions wrote a book detailing the animals&#x27; predatory behaviour; they were larger than normal and lacked manes, and one seemed to suffer from tooth decay. The infirmity theory, including tooth decay, is not favoured by all researchers; an analysis of teeth and jaws of man-eating lions in museum collections suggests that while tooth decay may explain some incidents, prey depletion in human-dominated areas is a more likely cause of lion predation on humans. Sick or injured animals may be more prone to man-eating but the behaviour is not unusual, nor necessarily aberrant.

Lions&#x27; proclivity for man-eating has been systematically examined. American and Tanzanian scientists report that man-eating behaviour in rural areas of Tanzania increased greatly from 1990 to 2005. At least 563 villagers were attacked and many eaten over this period. The incidents occurred near Selous Game Reserve in Rufiji River and in Lindi Region near the Mozambican border. While the expansion of villages into bush country is one concern, the authors argue conservation policy must mitigate the danger because in this case, conservation contributes directly to human deaths. Cases in Lindi in which lions seize humans from the centres of substantial villages have been documented. Another study of 1,000 people attacked by lions in southern Tanzania between 1988 and 2009 found that the weeks following the full moon, when there was less moonlight, were a strong indicator of increased night-time attacks on people.

According to Robert R. Frump, Mozambican refugees regularly crossing Kruger National Park, South Africa, at night are attacked and eaten by lions. Frump said thousands may have been killed in the decades after apartheid sealed the park and forced refugees to cross the park at night.

===Cultural significance===
The lion is one of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture. It has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. It is considered to be the &#x27;King of Beasts&#x27; and has symbolised power, royalty and protection. Several leaders have had &quot;lion&quot; in their name including Sundiata Keita of the Mali Empire, who was called &quot;Lion of Mali&quot;, and Richard the Lionheart of England. The male&#x27;s mane makes it a particularly recognisable feature and thus has been represented more than the female. Nevertheless, the lioness has also had importance as a guardian.

In sub-Saharan Africa, the lion has been a common character in stories, proverbs and dances, but rarely featured in visual arts. In the Swahili language, the lion is known as &quot;simba&quot; which also means &quot;aggressive&quot;, &quot;king&quot; and &quot;strong&quot;. In parts of West and East Africa, the lion is associated with healing and provides the connection between seers and the supernatural. In other East African traditions, the lion represents laziness. In much of African folklore, the lion is portrayed as having low intelligence and is easily tricked. In Nubia, the lion-god Apedemak was associated with the flooding of the Nile. In Ancient Egypt, lions were linked both with the sun and the waters of the Nile. Several gods were conceived as being part lion, including the war deities Sekhmet and Maahes, and Tefnut, the goddess of moisture..

The lion was a prominent symbol in ancient Mesopotamia from Sumer up to Assyrian and Babylonian times, where it was strongly associated with kingship. The big cat was a symbol and steed of fertility goddess Inanna. Lions decorate the Processional Way leading to the Ishtar Gate in Babylon which was built by Nebuchadnezzar II in the 6th century BCE. The Lion of Babylon symbolised the power of the king and protection of the land against enemies, but was also invoked for good luck. The constellation Leo the lion was first recognised by the Sumerians around 4,000 years ago and is the fifth sign of the zodiac. In ancient Israel, a lion represented the tribe of Judah. Lions are frequently mentioned in the Bible, notably in the Book of Daniel, in which the eponymous hero is forced to sleep in the lions&#x27; den.
Indo-Persian chroniclers regarded the lion as keeper of order in the realm of animals. The Sanskrit word &quot;mrigendra&quot; signifies a lion as king of animals. In India, the Lion Capital of Ashoka, erected by Emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century CE, depicts four lions standing back to back. In Hindu mythology, the half-lion Narasimha, an avatar of the deity Vishnu, battles and slays the evil ruler Hiranyakashipu. In Buddhist art, lions are associated with both &quot;arhats&quot; and bodhisattvas and may be ridden by the Manjushri. Though they were never native to the country, lions have played important roles in Chinese culture. Statues of the beast have guarded the entrances to the imperial palace and many religious shrines. The lion dance has been performed for over a thousand years.

In ancient Greece, the lion is featured in several of Aesop&#x27;s fables, notably The Lion and the Mouse. In Greek mythology, the Nemean lion is slain by the hero Heracles who wears its skin. Lancelot and Gawain were also heroes slaying lions in medieval Europe. Lions continue to appear in modern literature such as the Cowardly Lion in L. Frank Baum&#x27;s 1900 &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, and in C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;. The lion was portrayed as the ruler of animals in the 1994 Disney animated feature film &quot;The Lion King&quot;.

==History==
Graves from the Hallstatt era and La Tène era (325-250 BC) as well as other traces from the Bronze Age were discovered in Epagny. The remains of a Roman era villa from the 2nd-3rd century AD and an Early Middle Ages cemetery were also found nearby. A Roman settlement was probably located on a hill in Gruyères.
Gruyères stands in the midst of the Fribourg green pre-Alpine foothills. The castle towers above the medieval town. Gruerius, the legendary founder of Gruyères, captured a crane (in French: “grue”) and chose it as his heraldic animal, inspiring the name Gruyères. Despite the importance of the House of Gruyères, its beginnings remain quite mysterious. Gruyères is first mentioned around 1138-39 as &quot;de Grueri&quot;. The town developed beneath the castle, which the Count of Gruyere had built on top of the hill, to control the upper Saanen valley. By 1195-96 it became a market town with a central street and city walls. The town developed separately of the castle. In 1397 Count Rudolph IV of Gruyères confirmed an older town charter that was based on the model of Moudon.

On 22 June 1476 Gruyères participated in the Battle of Morat against Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. With the help of the Old Swiss Confederacy, they routed the Burgundian army and captured three capes of the Order of the Golden Fleece which belonged to Charles the Bold including one with the emblems of Philip the Good, his father. At the time of the battle he was celebrating the anniversary of the death of his father.
The town church of Gruyères originally belonged to the parish of Bulle. Count Rudolph III allowed the villages on the left bank of the Saane to build St. Theodul&#x27;s church. When it was dedicated in 1254, it was the parish church of the new Gruyères parish. The Counts of Gruyères were buried under the altar of St. Michael in the church. It was mostly destroyed in 1670 and again in 1856 by fire, which only left the choir and tower undamaged. The renovated church was consecrated in 1860. In addition to the parish church, the Counts had the Chapel of St. John the Baptist in the castle, with two glass windows dating from the late 15th century. The Chapel of St. Moritz in the old hospital was built with the hospital in 1431. The Chapelle du Berceau was built in 1612, following a plague that killed 140.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, nuns from St. Bernard and the Visitation Order fled from Besançon and Dole to settle in Gruyères. The latter remained in town between 1639 and 1651 and conducted a private school. Starting in the 15th century a primary school opened in town which was open mainly to boys. A secondary school opened in town in the 20th century but it moved in 1973 to Bulle. Gruyères had a plague house which was first mentioned in 1341. The town&#x27;s hospital was founded in the mid-15th century and remained in operation until the second half of the 19th century. One side of the hospital building housed the primary school until 1988 and was then renovated into a nursing home. Between 1891 and 1925 the Ingenbohl sisters ran the Deaf and Dumb Institute of Saint-Joseph in Gruyères. In 1925 it moved to Fribourg.
Nineteen counts are accounted for in the period between the 11th and 16th centuries. The last of them, Michel, had been in financial trouble almost all his life only to end in bankruptcy in 1554. His creditors the cantons of Fribourg and Bern shared his earldom between them. From 1555 to 1798 the castle became residence to the bailiffs and then to the prefects sent by Fribourg. In 1849 the castle was put up for sale and sold to the Bovy and Balland families, who stayed at the castle during summer time and restored it with the help of their painter friends. The castle was then bought back by the canton of Fribourg in 1938, made into a museum and opened to the public. Since 1993, a foundation ensures the conservation as well as the highlighting of the building and the collection.

===Tourism===

Gruyère cheese is an important factor in supporting the tourist trade in the region. A major tourist attraction is the medieval town of Gruyères with its castle, containing a regional museum and an arts museum. There are cultural activities in the castle (concerts, theater). There is a cheese factory in Pringy which is open to visitors. Nearby is Mont Moléson, a mountain suitable for climbing, or for the less athletic there is a cablecar to the summit which was rebuilt in 1998. The resort town Moléson-Village caters for both summer and winter tourism.

In 1998 Swiss surrealist painter, sculptor and set designer H. R. Giger acquired the Saint-Germain Castle, and it now houses the H. R. Giger Museum and Bar, a permanent repository of his work and is a popular tourist destination. Next to this, there is a museum holding antiquities from Tibet.

===Main sights===
The castle was constructed between 1270 and 1282 in the typical square plan of the fortifications in Savoy. The end of the 15th century stands out as the golden age in the history of the counts. In 1476, count Louis takes part in the Burgundy war by the Confederates’ side. Following this deed of valour, modernization works were undertaken. The adjustment of the esplanade with its chapel, the spiral staircase in the courtyard and the transformation of the main building go back to that time. Thus, the castle loses its fortress appearance to become a stately residence. The baroque interiors remind one of the time when the bailiffs sent by Fribourg lived there. The romantic landscapes were painted in the mid-19th century by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Barthélemy Menn and other artists.

<doc id="36900" wikidata="Q200441" url="?curid=36900" title="Antioch">
<text>Antioch on the Orontes (; , ) was a Hellenistic Greek city founded by Seleucus I Nicator in 300 BC. One of the most important Greek cities of the Hellenistic period, it served as the capital of the Seleucid Empire and later as regional capital to both the Roman and Byzantine Empire. During the Crusades, Antioch served as the capital of the Principality of Antioch, one of four Crusader states that were founded in the Levant. Its inhabitants were known as &quot;Antiochenes&quot;. Any remains of the ancient city of Antioch are mostly buried beneath alluvial deposits from the Orontes River. The modern city of Antakya, in Hatay Province, lies in its place.

Antioch was founded near the end of the fourth century BC by Seleucus I Nicator, one of Alexander the Great&#x27;s generals, as one of the tetrapoleis of Seleucis of Syria. Seleucus encouraged Greeks from all over the Mediterranean to settle in the city. The city&#x27;s location offered geographical, military, and economic benefits to its occupants; Antioch was heavily involved in the spice trade and lay within close reach of the Silk Road and the Royal Road. The city was the capital of the Seleucid Empire from 240 BC until 63 BC, when the Romans took control, making it the capital of the province of Syria and later of Coele Syria. During the late Hellenistic and Roman Principate periods, Antioch&#x27;s population may have reached a peak of over 500,000 inhabitants (most generally estimate between 200,000 and 250,000), making the city the third largest in the Roman Empire after Rome and Alexandria and one of the most important cities in the eastern Mediterranean. From the early fourth century, Antioch was the seat of the &quot;comes Orientis&quot;, head of the Diocese of the East. The Romans provided the city with walls that encompassed almost , of which one quarter was mountainous, leaving – about one-fifth the area of Rome within the Aurelian Walls.

The city was also the main center of Hellenistic Judaism at the end of the Second Temple period. As one of the cities of the pentarchy, Antioch was called &quot;the cradle of Christianity&quot; as a result of its longevity and the pivotal role that it played in the emergence of early Christianity. The Christian New Testament asserts that the name &quot;Christian&quot; first emerged in Antioch. The city declined to relative insignificance during the Middle Ages due to warfare, repeated earthquakes, and a change in trade routes. The city still lends its name to the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch, one of the most important modern churches of the Levant and the eastern Mediterranean. The city also attracts Muslim pilgrims who visit the Habib-i Nejjar Mosque, which they believe to contain the tomb of Habib the Carpenter, mentioned in surah Yā-Sīn of the Quran.

==Geography==
Two routes from the Mediterranean Sea, lying through the Orontes river gorge and the Belen Pass, converge in the plain of the Antioch Lake, now called Lake Amik, and are met there by:
#the road from the Amanian Gate (Baghche Pass) and western Commagene, which descends the valley of the Karasu to the Afrin River;
#the roads from eastern Commagene and the Euphratean crossings at Samosata (now Samsat) and Apamea Zeugma (Birejik), which descend the valleys of the Afrin and the Queiq; and
#the road from the Euphratean ford at Thapsacus, which skirts the fringe of the Syrian steppe. A single route proceeds south in the Orontes valley.

== Prehistory ==

A settlement called &quot;Meroe&quot; pre-dated Antioch. A shrine of the goddess Anat, called by Herodotus the &quot;Persian Artemis&quot;, was located here. This site was included in the eastern suburbs of Antioch. There was a village on the spur of Mount Silpius named &quot;Io&quot;, or &quot;Iopolis&quot;. This name was always adduced as evidence by Antiochenes (&quot;e.g.&quot; Libanius) eager to affiliate themselves to the Attic Ionians—an eagerness which is illustrated by the Athenian types used on the city&#x27;s coins. Io may have been a small early colony of trading Greeks (Javan). John Malalas also mentions an archaic village, Bottia, in the plain by the river.

== Foundation by Seleucus I ==
Alexander the Great is said to have camped on the site of Antioch and dedicated an altar to Zeus Bottiaeus; it lay in the northwest of the future city. This account is found only in the writings of Libanius, a fourth-century orator from Antioch, and may be legend intended to enhance Antioch&#x27;s status. But the story is not unlikely in itself.

After Alexander&#x27;s death in 323 BC, his generals, the Diadochi, divided up the territory he had conquered. After the Battle of Ipsos in 301 BC, Seleucus I Nicator won the territory of Syria, and he proceeded to found four &quot;sister cities&quot; in northwestern Syria, one of which was Antioch, a city named in honor of his father Antiochus; according to the &quot;Suda&quot;, it might be named after his son Antiochus. He is reputed to have built sixteen Antiochs.

Seleucus founded Antioch on a site chosen through ritual means. An eagle, the bird of Zeus, had been given a piece of sacrificial meat and the city was founded on the site to which the eagle carried the offering. Seleucus did this on the 22nd day of the month of Artemísios in the twelfth year of his reign, equivalent to May 300 BC. Antioch soon rose above Seleucia Pieria to become the Syrian capital.

Xenaeus (Ξεναῖος) was the architect who built the walls of Antioch during Seleucus I&#x27;s reign.


== Hellenistic age ==
The original city of Seleucus was laid out in imitation of the grid plan of Alexandria by the architect Xenarius. Libanius describes the first building and arrangement of this city (i. p. 300. 17).

The citadel was on Mount Silpius and the city lay mainly on the low ground to the north, fringing the river. Two great colonnaded streets intersected in the centre. Shortly afterwards a second quarter was laid out, probably on the east and by Antiochus I Soter, which, from an expression of Strabo, appears to have been the native, as contrasted with the Greek, town. It was enclosed by a wall of its own.

In the Orontes, north of the city, lay a large island, and on this Seleucus II Callinicus began a third walled &quot;city&quot;, which was finished by Antiochus III the Great. A fourth and last quarter was added by Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175–164 BC); thenceforth Antioch was known as &quot;Tetrapolis&quot;. From west to east the whole was about in diameter and a little less from north to south. This area included many large gardens.

The new city was populated by a mix of local settlers that Athenians brought from the nearby city of Antigonia, Macedonians, and Jews (who were given full status from the beginning). According to ancient tradition, Antioch was settled by 5,500 Athenians and Macedonians, together with an unknown number of native Syrians. This number probably refers to free adult citizens, so that the total number of free Greek settlers including women and children was probably between 17,000 and 25,000.

About west and beyond the suburb Heraclea lay the paradise of Daphne, a park of woods and waters, in the midst of which rose a great temple to the Pythian Apollo, also founded by Seleucus I and enriched with a cult-statue of the god, as Musagetes, by Bryaxis. A companion sanctuary of Hecate was constructed underground by Diocletian. The beauty and the lax morals of Daphne were celebrated all over the ancient world; and indeed Antioch as a whole shared in both these titles to fame.

Antioch became the capital and court-city of the western Seleucid Empire under Antiochus I, its counterpart in the east being Seleucia; but its paramount importance dates from the battle of Ancyra (240 BC), which shifted the Seleucid centre of gravity from Anatolia, and led indirectly to the rise of Pergamon.

The Seleucids reigned from Antioch. We know little of it in the Hellenistic period, apart from Syria, all our information coming from authors of the late Roman time. Among its great Greek buildings we hear only of the theatre, of which substructures still remain on the flank of Silpius, and of the royal palace, probably situated on the island. It enjoyed a reputation for being &quot;a populous city, full of most erudite men and rich in the most liberal studies&quot;, but the only names of distinction in these pursuits during the Seleucid period that have come down to us are Apollophanes, the Stoic, and one Phoebus, a writer on dreams. The nicknames which they gave to their later kings were Aramaic; and, except Apollo and Daphne, the great divinities of north Syria seem to have remained essentially native, such as the &quot;Persian Artemis&quot; of Meroe and Atargatis of Hierapolis Bambyce.

The epithet &quot;Golden&quot; suggests that the external appearance of Antioch was impressive, but the city needed constant restoration owing to the seismic disturbances to which the district has always been subjected. The first great earthquake in recorded history was related by the native chronicler John Malalas. It occurred in 148 BC and did immense damage.

Local politics were turbulent. In the many dissensions of the Seleucid house the population took sides, and frequently rose in rebellion, for example against Alexander Balas in 147 BC, and Demetrius II Nicator in 129 BC. The latter, enlisting a body of Jews, punished his capital with fire and sword. In the last struggles of the Seleucid house, Antioch turned against its feeble rulers, invited Tigranes the Great to occupy the city in 83 BC, tried to unseat Antiochus XIII Asiaticus in 65 BC, and petitioned Rome against his restoration in the following year. Antioch&#x27;s wish prevailed, and it passed with Syria to the Roman Republic in 64 BC, but remained a &quot;civitas libera&quot;.

== Roman period ==
===Roman rule before Constantine===


The Roman emperors favored the city from the first moments, seeing it as a more suitable capital for the eastern part of the empire than Alexandria could be, because of the isolated position of Egypt. To a certain extent they tried to make it an eastern Rome. Julius Caesar visited it in 47 BC, and confirmed its freedom. A great temple to Jupiter Capitolinus rose on Silpius, probably at the insistence of Octavian, whose cause the city had espoused. A forum of Roman type was laid out. Tiberius built two long colonnades on the south towards Silpius.

Strabo, writing in the reign of Augustus and the first years of Tiberius, states that Antioch is not much smaller than Seleucia and Alexandria; Alexandria had been said by Diodorus Siculus in the mid-first century BC to have 300,000 free inhabitants, which would mean that Antioch was about this size in Strabo&#x27;s time.

Agrippa and Tiberius enlarged the theatre, and Trajan finished their work. Antoninus Pius paved the great east to west artery with granite. A circus, other colonnades and great numbers of baths were built, and new aqueducts to supply them bore the names of Caesars, the finest being the work of Hadrian. The Roman client, King Herod (most likely the great builder Herod the Great), erected a long &quot;stoa&quot; on the east, and Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa (–12 BC) encouraged the growth of a new suburb south of this.

One of the most famous Roman additions to the city was its hippodrome, the Circus of Antioch. This chariot racing venue was probably built in the reign of Augustus, when the city had more than half a million inhabitants; it was modelled on the Circus Maximus in Rome and other circus buildings throughout the empire. Measuring more than in length and of width, the Circus could house up to 80,000 spectators. 

Zarmanochegas (Zarmarus) a monk of the Sramana tradition of India, according to Strabo and Dio Cassius, met Nicholas of Damascus in Antioch around 13 AD as part of a Mission to Augustus. At Antioch Germanicus died in 19 AD, and his body was burnt in the forum.

An earthquake that shook Antioch in AD 37 caused the emperor Caligula to send two senators to report on the condition of the city. Another quake followed in the next reign.

Titus visited Antioch in the spring of 71 AD, where he encountered a crowd demanding the expulsion of Jews from the city. He refused, explaining that their country had been destroyed, and no other place would accept them. The crowd then sought to revoke the Jews&#x27; political privileges by asking Titus to remove the bronze tablets inscribed with their rights, but Titus declined once more.

In 115 AD, during Trajan&#x27;s travel there during his war against Parthia, the whole site was convulsed by a huge earthquake. The landscape altered, and the emperor himself was forced to take shelter in the circus for several days. He and his successor restored the city, but the population was reduced to less than 400,000 inhabitants and many sections of the city were abandoned.

Commodus (r. 177–192 AD) had Olympic games celebrated at Antioch.
In 256 AD, the town was suddenly raided by the Persians under Shapur I, and many of the people were slain in the theatre. The city was burned and some 100,000 inhabitants were killed while the rest were deported to Shapur&#x27;s newly built city of Gundeshapur. It was recaptured by the Roman emperor Valerian the following year.

=== Christianity ===
Antioch was a chief center of early Christianity during Roman times, and converts there were the first people to be called Christians. The city had a large population of Jewish origin in a quarter called the Kerateion, and so attracted the earliest missionaries. Among these was Peter himself, according to the tradition upon which the Patriarchate of Antioch still rests its claim for primacy. This is not to be confused with Antioch in Pisidia, to which Barnabas and Paul of Tarsus later travelled.

Between 252 and 300 AD, ten assemblies of the church were held at Antioch and it became the seat of one of the five original patriarchates, along with Constantinople, Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Rome (see Pentarchy). Today five churches use the title of patriarch of Antioch for their prime bishops: one Oriental Orthodox (the Syriac Orthodox Church); three Eastern Catholic (the Maronite, Syriac Catholic, and Melkite Greek Catholic Churches); and one Eastern Orthodox (the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch). This title has been maintained though most of them have moved their seat to Damascus. This is somewhat analogous to the manner in which several popes, heads of the Roman Catholic Church remained &quot;Bishop of Rome&quot; even while residing in Avignon, in present-day France, in the fourteenth century. The Maronite Church, which has also moved the seat away to Bkerké, Lebanon, continues the Antiochene liturgical tradition and the use of the Syro-Aramaic language in their liturgies.

Emperor Constantine who had decriminalised Christianity in 313, begun the building of the Domus Aurea or Great Church in 327 which served for the next two centuries as the leading church of Antioch.

John Chrysostom writes that when Ignatius of Antioch was bishop in the city, the &quot;dêmos,&quot; probably meaning the number of free adult men and women without counting children and slaves, numbered 200,000. In a letter written in 363, Libanius says the city contains 150,000 &quot;anthrôpoi&quot; (plural of anthropos, human) a word which would ordinarily mean all human beings of any age, sex, or social status, seemingly indicating a decline in the population since the first century. Chrysostom also says in one of his homilies on the Gospel of Matthew, which were delivered between 386 and 393, that in his own time there were 100,000 Christians in Antioch, a figure which may refer to orthodox Christians who belonged to the Great Church as opposed to members of other groups such as Arians and Apollinarians, or to all Christians of any persuasion.

=== Age of Julian and Valens ===

When the emperor Julian visited in 362 on a detour to the Sasanian Empire, he had high hopes for Antioch, regarding it as a rival to the imperial capital of Constantinople. Antioch had a mixed pagan and Christian population, which Ammianus Marcellinus implies lived quite harmoniously together. However, Julian&#x27;s visit began ominously as it coincided with a lament for Adonis, the doomed lover of Aphrodite. Thus, Ammianus wrote, the emperor and his soldiers entered the city not to the sound of cheers but to wailing and screaming.

After being advised that the bones of third-century martyred bishop Babylas were suppressing the oracle of Apollo at Daphne, he made a public-relations mistake in ordering the removal of the bones from the vicinity of the temple. The result was a massive Christian procession. Shortly after that, when the temple was destroyed by fire, Julian suspected the Christians and ordered stricter investigations than usual. He also shut up Constantine&#x27;s Great Church, before the investigations proved that the fire was the result of an accident.

Julian found much else to criticize about the Antiochenes; he had wanted the empire&#x27;s cities to be more self-managing, as they had been some 200 years before, but Antioch&#x27;s city councilmen showed themselves unwilling to shore up a local food shortage with their own resources, so dependent were they on the emperor. Ammianus wrote that the councilmen shirked their duties by bribing unwitting men in the marketplace to do the job for them. Further, Julian was surprised and dismayed when at the city&#x27;s annual feast of Apollo the only Antiochene present was an old priest clutching a goose, showing the decay of paganism in the town.

Ammianus writes that the Antiochenes hated Julian in turn for worsening the food shortage with the burden of his billeted troops. His enthusiasm for large scale animal sacrifice meant that the soldiers were often to be found gorged on sacrificial meat, making a drunken nuisance of themselves on the streets while Antioch&#x27;s hungry citizens looked on in disgust. The Christian Antiochenes and Julian&#x27;s pagan Gallic soldiers also never quite saw eye to eye. Even to those who kept the old religion, Julian&#x27;s brand of paganism was distasteful, being very much unique to himself, with little support outside the most educated Neoplatonist circles. Julian gained no admiration for his personal involvement in the sacrifices, only the nickname &quot;axeman&quot;, wrote Ammianus.

The emperor&#x27;s high-handed, severe methods and his rigid administration prompted Antiochene lampoons about, among other things, Julian&#x27;s unfashionably pointed beard.

Julian&#x27;s successor Valens endowed Antioch with a new forum, including a statue of his brother and co-emperor Valentinian I on a central column, and reopened the great church of Constantine, which stood until the Persian sack in 538, by Chosroes.

=== Theodosius and after ===
In 387 AD, there was a great sedition caused by a new tax levied by order of Theodosius I, and the city was punished by the loss of its metropolitan status. Theodosius placed Antioch under Constantinople&#x27;s rule when he divided the Roman Empire.

John Malalas, a chronicler writing in the 6th century, describes a theater in the city&#x27;s suburb of Daphne that was built on the ruins of a synagogue. The theater had an inscription stating it was constructed &quot;from the spoils of Judaea&quot;. He also mentions a gate of cherubs in the city, which Titus constructed using the spoils of the Second Temple.

Antioch and its port, Seleucia Pieria, were severely damaged by the great earthquake of 526. Seleucia Pieria, which was already fighting a losing battle against continual silting, never recovered. A second earthquake affected Antioch in 528. Justinian I renamed Antioch Theopolis (&quot;City of God&quot;) and restored many of its public buildings, but the destructive work was completed in 540 by the Persian king, Khosrau I, who deported the population to a newly built city in Persian Mesopotamia, Weh Antiok Khosrow. Antioch lost as many as 300,000 people. Justinian I made an effort to revive it, and Procopius describes his repairing of the walls; but its glory was past. Another earthquake in 588 destroyed the Domus Aureus of Constantine, whereafter the church of Cassian became the most important church of Antioch.

During the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, the Emperor Heraclius confronted the invading Persian army of Khosrow II outside Antioch in 613. The Byzantines were defeated by forces under the generals Shahrbaraz and Shahin Vahmanzadegan at the Battle of Antioch, after which the city fell to the Sassanians, together with much of Syria and eastern Anatolia.

Antioch gave its name to a certain school of Christian thought, distinguished by literal interpretation of the Scriptures and insistence on the human limitations of Jesus. Diodorus of Tarsus and Theodore of Mopsuestia were the leaders of this school. The principal local saint was Simeon Stylites, who lived an extremely ascetic life atop a pillar for 40 years some east of Antioch. His body was brought to the city and buried in a building erected under the emperor Leo. During the Byzantine era, great bathhouses were built in Byzantine centers such as Constantinople and Antioch.

== Arab and Byzantine era ==

In 637, during the reign of the Byzantine emperor Heraclius, Antioch was conquered by Abu Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah of the Rashidun Caliphate during the Battle of the Iron Bridge, marking the beginning of Islamic influence in the region. The city became known in Arabic as . Under the Umayyad Caliphate (661–750 AD), Antioch served as a significant military and administrative center. The Umayyads fortified the city, utilizing it as a base for operations in the region. The city remained an important urban center, with its multicultural population including Christians, Muslims, and Jews living together, although there were periods of tension and conflict. However, since the Umayyad dynasty was unable to penetrate the Anatolian Plateau, Antioch found itself on the frontline of the conflicts between two hostile empires during the next 350 years, so that the city went into a precipitous decline. During the Abbasid period (750–969 AD), Antioch continued to thrive as a hub of commerce and culture. Under the Abbasids, closer relations were developed with Byzantium, but it was not until the Fatimids opened up the Mediterranean for shipping from the end of the fourth/tenth century that the affairs of western Europe and the Near East began to interact once again. The Abbasids placed a strong emphasis on trade, which facilitated economic prosperity in Antioch. The city became known for its diverse markets, contributing to the flow of goods and ideas between the Islamic world and the Byzantine Empire.
The decline of Arab rule in Antioch began in the late 9th century with increasing pressure from the Byzantine forces. The city changed hands several times during the Byzantine-Arab wars, Before finally, in 969 AD, under the Byzantine Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas, the city was captured after the siege of Antioch (968–969) by the Byzantine general Michael Bourtzes and the &quot;stratopedarches&quot; Peter. It soon became the seat of a &quot;doux&quot;, the civil governor of the homonymous theme, but also the seat of the somewhat more important &quot;Domestic of the Schools of the Orient&quot;, the supreme military commander of the imperial forces on the eastern frontier. Sometimes both offices were held by the same person, usually military officers such as Nikephoros Ouranos, or Philaretos Brachamios, who managed to retain the integrity of the eastern borderline after the Seljuk conquest of Anatolia. The size of the Melkite community increased during that time due to immigration from Christians from Fatimid Egypt but also other parts of the Near East and Christians remained the dominant population up to the Crusades.

As the empire disintegrated rapidly before the Komnenian restoration, &quot;Dux of Antioch&quot; &amp; &quot;Domestic of the Schools of the East&quot; Philaretos Brachamios held the city until Suleiman ibn Qutalmish, the emir of Rum, captured it from him in 1084. Two years later, Suleiman was killed fighting against Tutush, the brother of the Seljuk Sultan, who annexed the city into the Seljuk Empire. Yagisiyan was appointed governor. He became increasingly independent within the tumultuous years following Malik-Shah&#x27;s death in 1092.

== Crusader era ==

The Crusaders&#x27; Siege of Antioch conquered the city in June 1098 after a siege lasting eight months on their way to Jerusalem. At this time, the bulk of far eastern trade traveled through Egypt, but in the second half of the 12th century Nur ed-Din and later Saladin brought order to Muslim Syria, opening up long-distance trade routes, including to Antioch and on to its new port, St Symeon, which had replaced Seleucia Pieria. However, the Mongol conquests of the 13th century altered the main trade routes from the far east, as they encouraged merchants to take the overland route through Mongol territory to the Black Sea, reducing the prosperity of Antioch. Surrounding the city were a number of Greek, Syrian, Georgian, Armenian, and Latin monasteries.

===Consolidation of the Principality===
In 1100, Tancred became the regent of Antioch after his uncle and predecessor Bohemond I of Antioch was taken prisoner for three years (1100–03) by Gazi Gümüshtigin of the Danishmends at the Battle of Melitene. Tancred expanded the territory of Antioch by conquering Byzantine Cilicia, Tarsus, and Adana in 1101. In 1107 Bohemond enraged by an earlier defeat, renamed Tancred as the regent of Antioch so he could sail for Europe with the intent of gaining support for an attack against the Greeks.

Bohemond laid siege to Dyrrachium but capitulated in September 1108 and was forced to accede to a peace accord, the Treaty of Devol which stipulated that Bohemond was to hold Antioch for the remainder of his life as the emperor&#x27;s subject and the Greek patriarch was to be restored to power in the city. However, Tancred refused to honor the Treaty of Deabolis in which Bohemond swore an oath, and it is not until 1156 that it truly became a vassal state of the Byzantine Empire. Six months after the Treaty of Deabolis Bohemond died, and Tancred remained regent of Antioch until his death during a typhoid epidemic in 1112.

After the death of Tancred, the principality passed to Roger of Salerno, who helped rebuild Antioch after an earthquake destroyed its foundations in 1114. With the death of Roger at the Battle of Ager Sanguinis in 1119, the role of regent was assumed by Baldwin II of Jerusalem, lasting until 1126. In 1126 Bohemond II arrived from Apulia to gain regency over Antioch. In 1130 Bohemond was lured into an ambush by Leo I, Prince of Armenia who allied with the Danishmend Gazi Gümüshtigin, and was killed in the subsequent battle.

Antioch was again ruled by a regency, firstly being Baldwin II, after his daughter and Bohemond II&#x27;s wife, Alice of Antioch attempted to block Baldwin from entering Antioch, but failed when Antiochene nobles such as Fulk of Jerusalem (Alice&#x27;s brother-in-law) opened up the gates for representatives of Baldwin II. Alice was then expelled from Antioch. With the death of Baldwin in 1131, Alice briefly took control of Antioch and allied herself with Pons of Tripoli and Joscelin II of Edessa in an attempt to prevent Fulk, King of Jerusalem from marching north in 1132; however, this attempt failed. In 1133 the king chose Raymond of Poitiers as a groom for Constance of Antioch, daughter of Bohemund II of Antioch and Alice, princess of Jerusalem. The marriage took place in 1136 between the 21-year-old Raymond and the 9-year-old Constance.

Immediately after assuming control, Raymond was involved in conflicts with the Byzantine Emperor John II Comnenus who had come south to recover Cilicia from Leo of Armenia, and to reassert his rights over Antioch. The engagement lasted until 1137 when emperor John II arrived with an army before the walls of Antioch. Although the basileus did not enter the city, his banner was raised atop the citadel and Raymond was compelled to do homage. Raymond agreed with the emperor that if he was capable of capturing Aleppo, Shaizar, and Homs, he would exchange Antioch for them. John went on to attack Aleppo with the aid of Antioch and Edessa, and failed to capture it, with the Franks withdrawing their support when he moved on to capture Shaizar. John returned to Antioch ahead of his army and entered Antioch, only to be forced to leave when Joscelin II, Count of Edessa rallied the citizens to oust him. After the fall of Edessa in 1144, many Syriac Orthodox Christians came into the city, spreading the veneration of Mor Barsauma among the local population which resulted in the building of a church to the saint in 1156.

=== Second Crusade ===
Nur ad-Din Zangi attacked Antioch in both 1147 and 1148 and succeeded during the second venture in occupying most of the territory east of the Orontes but failed to capture Antioch itself. Louis VII of France arrived in Antioch on March 19, 1148, where he was welcomed by the uncle of his spouse Eleanor of Aquitaine, Raymond of Poitiers.

Louis refused to help Antioch defend against the Turks and to lead an expedition against Aleppo, and instead decided to finish his pilgrimage to Jerusalem rather than focus on the military aspect of the Crusades. With Louis quickly leaving Antioch again and the Crusaders returning home in 1149.

With Raymond dead and Bohemond III only five years of age, the principality came under the control of Raymond&#x27;s widow Constance of Antioch; however, real control lay with Aimery of Limoges. In 1153, Constance chose Raynald of Châtillon and married him in secret without consulting her first cousin and liege lord, Baldwin III, and neither Baldwin nor Aimery of Limoges approved of her choice.

In 1156 Raynald claimed that the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus had reneged on his promises to pay Raynald a sum of money, and would later attack Cyprus. This caused Manuel I Comnenus to raise an army to Syria. Raynald then surrendered, the emperor insisted on the installation of a Greek Patriarch and the surrender of the citadel in Antioch. The following spring, Manuel made a triumphant entry into the city and established himself as the unquestioned suzerain of Antioch.

In 1160 Raynald was captured by Muslims and held captive for 16 years, with Raynald disposed of for a long time, the patriarch Aimery became the new regent, chosen by Baldwin III. To further consolidate his own claim over Antioch, Manuel chose Maria of Antioch as his bride, daughter of Constanceand Raymond. Antioch remained in crisis until 1163 when Constance asked the Armenia to help maintain her rule, as a result the citizens of Antioch exiled her and installed her son Bohemond III and now brother-in-law to the emperor, as regent.

One year later, Nur ad-Din Zangi captured Bohemond III but was soon released; however, Harem, Syria, which Raynald had recaptured in 1158, was lost again and the frontier of Antioch was permanently placed west of the Orontes.

=== Third Crusade ===
While travelling on crusade, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa drowned in the river Saleph. His son, Frederick VI, then led the remnant of the Crusader army south towards Antioch. Subsequently, he arranged for his father&#x27;s flesh remains to be buried in the Cathedral of Saint Peter in Antioch. Throughout the Third Crusade, Antioch remained neutral; however, with the end of the Third Crusade (1192), they were included in the Treaty of Ramla between Richard and Saladin.

Henry II, Count of Champagne travelled to Lesser Armenia and managed to persuade Leo that in exchange for Antioch, renouncing its overlordship to Lesser Armenia and to release Bohemond, who died in 1201. With the death of Bohemond III there followed a 15-year struggle for power of Antioch, between Tripoli and Lesser Armenia. According to the rules of primogeniture Leo&#x27;s great nephew Raymond-Roupen was the rightful heir of Antioch, and Leo&#x27;s position was supported by the pope. On the other hand, however, the city commune of Antioch supported Bohemond IV of Antioch, on the grounds that he was the closest blood relative to the last ruling prince, Bohemond III. In 1207 Bohemond IV installed a Greek patriarch in Antioch, despite the East–West Schism, under the help of Aleppo, Bohemond IV drove Leo out of Antioch.

=== Fifth Crusade ===

The calling of the Fifth Crusade strengthened the support of Ayyubid Sultan al-Adil I who supported Raymond-Roupen&#x27;s claims in Antioch. In 1216 Leo installed Raymond-Roupen as prince of Antioch, ending all military aspect of the struggle between Tripoli and Lesser Armenia, but the citizens again revolted against Raymond-Roupen in and Bohemond of Tripoli was recognised as prince. From 1233 onwards Antioch declined and appeared rarely in records for 30 years, and in 1254 the altercations of the past between Antioch and Armenia were laid to rest when Bohemond VI of Antioch married the then 17‑year‑old Sibylla of Armenia, and Bohemond VI became a vassal of the Armenian kingdom. Effectively, the Armenian kings ruled Antioch while the prince of Antioch resided in Tripoli. The Armenians drew up a treaty with the Mongols, who were now ravaging Muslim lands, and under protection they extended their territory into the lands of the Seljuq dynasty in the north and the Aleppo territory to the south. Antioch was part of this Armeno-Mongol alliance. Bohemond VI managed to retake Lattakieh and reestablished the land bridge between Antioch and Tripoli, while the Mongols insisted he install the Greek patriarch there rather than a Latin one as the Mongols wanted to strengthen ties to the Orthodox Byzantines.

=== Fall of Antioch ===

In 1268, Baibars besieged Antioch, capturing the city on May 18. Baibars promised to spare the lives of the inhabitants, but broke his promise and razed the city, killing or enslaving nearly the entire population upon their surrender. Antioch&#x27;s ruler, Prince Bohemond VI was then left with no territories except the County of Tripoli. Without any southern fortifications and with Antioch isolated it could not withstand the resurgent Muslim forces, and with the fall of the city, the remainder of northern Syria eventually capitulated, ending the Latin presence in Syria. The Mamluk armies killed or enslaved every Christian in Antioch. In 1355 it still had a considerable population, but by 1432 there were only about 300 inhabited houses within its walls, mostly occupied by Turcomans.

== Ottoman period ==
Antioch was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire with the conquest of Syria in 1516. It formed a sub-province (&quot;sancak&quot;) or tax collectorship (&quot;muhassıllık&quot;) of the province of Aleppo (Aleppo Eyalet). Beginning in the mid-18th century, the district witnessed an influx of Alawite settlers coming from the Latakia area. The famous Barker family of British consuls had a summer home in Suwaydiyya (today&#x27;s Samandağ), at the mouth of the Orontes River, in the 19th century. Between 1831 and 1840, Antioch was the military headquarters of Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt during the Egyptian occupation of Syria, and served as a model site for the modernizing reforms he wished to institute.

==Archaeology==
Few traces of the once great Roman city are visible today aside from the massive fortification walls that snake up the mountains to the east of the modern city, several aqueducts, and the Church of St Peter (St Peter&#x27;s Cave Church, Cave-Church of St. Peter), said to be a meeting place of an Early Christian community. The majority of the Roman city lies buried beneath deep sediments from the Orontes River, or has been obscured by recent construction.

Between 1932 and 1939, archaeological excavations of Antioch were undertaken under the direction of the &quot;Committee for the Excavation of Antioch and Its Vicinity&quot;, which was made up of representatives from the Louvre Museum, the Baltimore Museum of Art, the Worcester Art Museum, Princeton University, Wellesley College, and later (1936) also the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University and its affiliate Dumbarton Oaks.

The excavation team failed to find the major buildings they hoped to unearth, including Constantine&#x27;s Great Octagonal Church or the imperial palace. However, a great accomplishment of the expedition was the discovery of high-quality Roman mosaics from villas and baths in Antioch, Daphne and Seleucia Pieria.

The principal excavations of Mosaics at Antioch led by Princeton University in March 1932 recovered nearly 300 mosaics. Many of these mosaics were originally displayed as floor mosaics in private homes during the second through sixth centuries AD, while others were displayed in baths and other public buildings. The majority of the Antioch mosaics are from the fourth and fifth centuries, Antioch&#x27;s golden age, though others from earlier times have survived as well. The mosaics depict a variety of images including animals, plants, and mythological beings, as well as scenes from the daily lives of people living in the area at the time. Each mosaic is bordered by intricate designs and contains bold, vibrant colors.

One mosaic includes a border that depicts a walk from Antioch to Daphne, showing many ancient buildings along the way. The mosaics are now displayed in the Hatay Archaeology Museum in Antakya. A collection of mosaics on both secular and sacred subjects which were once in churches, private homes, and other public spaces now hang in the Princeton University Art Museum and museums of other sponsoring institutions. The non-Islamic coins from the excavations were published by Dorothy B. Waage.

A statue in the Vatican and a number of figurines and statuettes perpetuate the type of its great patron goddess and civic symbol, the Tyche (Fortune) of Antioch – a majestic seated figure, crowned with the ramparts of Antioch&#x27;s walls and holding wheat stalks in her right hand, with the river Orontes as a youth swimming under her feet. According to William Robertson Smith the Tyche of Antioch was originally a young virgin sacrificed at the time of the founding of the city to ensure its continued prosperity and good fortune.

The northern edge of Antakya has been growing rapidly over recent years, and this construction has begun to expose large portions of the ancient city, which are frequently bulldozed and rarely protected by the local museum.

In April 2016, archaeologists discovered a Greek mosaic showing a skeleton lying down with a wine pitcher and loaf of bread alongside a text that reads: &quot;Be cheerful, enjoy your life&quot;, it is reportedly from the third century BC. Described as the &quot;reckless skeleton&quot; or &quot;skeleton mosaic&quot;, the mosaic is once thought to have belonged in the dining room of an upper-class home.

<text>The San Diego Zoo Safari Park is a zoo and safari park in San Diego, California, located in San Pasqual Valley. Opened in 1972, the park operates as a sister location to the San Diego Zoo in Balboa Park; it features a more specific focus on animals from arid environments.

The park houses over 3,000 animals representing more than 300 species. It hosts a large array of wild and endangered animals from every continent except Antarctica. It also includes a botanical garden with over one million plants. In 2022, the park attracted over 1.6 million visitors.

Its parent organization, the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, is a private nonprofit conservation organization, and has one of the largest zoological membership associations in the world. The San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance also operates the San Diego Zoo.

==History==
The San Diego Zoological Society became interested in developing a larger facility in 1964. The initial concept of the park was as a supplementary breeding facility for the San Diego Zoo, which would allow ample space for large animals and herding behaviors of ungulates.

The development proposed would differ significantly from that of a typical zoo in that animals would be exhibited in a naturalistic, spacious environment rather than in cages. In 1964, the park was assessed financially and then moved onto the next phase, with this resulting in three alternative developments—a conservation farm, a game preserve, or a ‘natural environment’ zoo. The natural environment zoo development was chosen over the conservation farm and game preserve even though it was the most expensive option. The estimated initial cost was $1,755,430.

The main purposes of this zoo were to be species conservation, breeding of animals for the San Diego Zoo (as well as trading between zoos) and providing areas where exotic animals arriving to the state of California could be quarantined and monitored. When it came to naming the park, five titles were considered: San Diego Animal Land, San Diego Safari Land, San Diego Wild Animal Safari, or the San Diego Wildlife Park; ultimately, the name chosen was the San Diego Wild Animal Park.

The scheduled opening day of the park was set for April 1, 1972; however, the gates did not open until May 10, 1972. The general layout of the park, designed by Charles Faust, included a large lagoon with a jungle plaza, an African fishing village, an aviary at the entrance of the park and approximately 50,000 plants were to be included in the landscaping. Although the park was scheduled to open in three years from the time of the groundbreaking, the total development of the park was estimated to take ten years.

The first two species to arrive at the park were the nilgai (an antelope from India and Nepal) and the Grant&#x27;s zebra, native to East Africa.
Subsequent species to arrive at the park included the gemsbok, a type of oryx from Southern Africa and Namibia, in addition to Zambian sable antelope, greater kudu, southern and northern white rhinoceros subspecies (which were both in-danger of extinction), the one-horned Indian rhinoceros, as well as ten South African cheetahs, brought to the park for breeding purposes.

When the park first opened, there were many cultural shows and programs, with groups invited from Africa and Asia. There were also many animal encounters and entertainment options available for guests to view various animal ambassador species.

In the summer of 2003, the San Diego Zoological Society and Lowry Park Zoo orchestrated the capture of 11 wild African elephants from the Hlane Royal National Park in Swaziland (since 2018 renamed to Eswatini). The zoos said the animals were scheduled to be killed due to overpopulation. However, In Defense of Animals disputes this, claiming that new fencing costing many times less than the capture and transport would have ended the need to remove any elephants from Swaziland, and that the Save Wild Elephants Coalition reported that there were three other sanctuaries in Africa that had offered to take the elephants. Five of these elephants are now at the park, and cumulatively, they have produced thirteen babies, as of 2013. In March 2012, five elephants were moved to the Reid Park Zoo in Tucson, Arizona, to form a new herd. A bull elephant, two cows, and two baby bulls were moved and, in return, two female elephants that had been together for years. Connie, an Asian elephant, and Shaba, an African elephant, were sent to the San Diego Zoo. Connie died from cancer in July 2012, just five months after the move. Shaba was slowly introduced into the herd in February 2013. On July 12, 2012, Ndulagave birth to Umzula. A male calf named Zuli was the largest elephant born at the park.

The California wildfire season in 2007, which officially started on October 21 that year, burned of native chaparral lands within the park and caused the park&#x27;s temporarily closure. The park moved many of their endangered animals out of danger of the fire. The flames did not reach any of the main enclosures, and no animals were killed or burned by the fire, though the flames could be seen clearly from several of the exhibits. The incidental deaths of a clapper rail and kiang were attributed to indirect effects of the blaze.

On June 30, 2010, the San Diego Zoo board of trustees voted to change the name of the park from the San Diego Wild Animal Park to the San Diego Zoo Safari Park to clarify what it offers, since the difference between the zoo proper and the &quot;animal park&quot; was unclear to some visitors. The name &quot;safari&quot; is supposed to emphasize &quot;the park&#x27;s spacious enclosures of free-ranging animals&quot; (as opposed to &quot;the closer quarters of the zoo&quot;), encouraging visits to both locations.

In July 2019, the park opened a new exhibit specifically for their rhinoceroses, the Nikhita Khan Rhino Centre (named after animal lover and lawyer Nikhita Khan), debuting as the home for six white rhinos. A few days after the center&#x27;s opening, one of the rhinos (named Victoria) gave birth to Edward, a male calf, becoming the first rhinoceros in North America to be born via artificial insemination.

In April 2024, the Ellen Trout Zoo&#x27;s male southern white rhinoceros, Bwana, permanently moved into this zoo to officially join its large crash. 

==Exhibits and attractions==

=== Asian Savanna and African Plains ===

The park&#x27;s largest exhibits, covering over , are the open-range enclosures. Visitors view various plains habitats from Africa and Asia.
Asian Savanna covers and displays Indian rhinoceros, Bactrian camels, banteng, gaur, urial, argali, dholes, and several species of Asian deer and antelope such as blackbuck, barasingha, North China sika deer, axis deer, Eld&#x27;s deer, Indochinese sika deer Père David&#x27;s deer, nilgai, white-lipped deer, sambar deer, and Bactrian deer. A number of smaller enclosures visible only from the tram are home to Somali wild ass, Arabian oryx, Rhim gazelle, markhor, Soemmerring&#x27;s gazelle, and Przewalski&#x27;s horses.
African Plains represents many regions and habitats. East Africa displays African buffalo, southern white rhinoceros, Rothschild&#x27;s giraffe, reticulated giraffe, fringe-eared oryx, waterbuck, Nile lechwe, red lechwe, impala, Grant&#x27;s gazelle, Thomson&#x27;s gazelle, and a lagoon with East African crowned cranes, pink-backed pelicans, Dalmatian pelicans, African sacred ibises and great white pelicans. The North Africa exhibit represents the Sahel and Sahara Desert that houses scimitar-horned oryx, Barbary stag, red-fronted gazelle, Barbary sheep, Dromedary camels, and Ankole-Watusi cattle. The Southern Africa field exhibits Grévy&#x27;s zebras. The South Africa field exhibit holds Masai giraffes, common eland, sable antelope, gemsbok, springbok, blue wildebeest and ostrich. The Central Africa region features a wooded waterhole with an island for saddle-billed storks, spur-winged geese, Lappet-faced vultures, Goliath herons, Egyptian geese, and Rüppell&#x27;s vultures. On the shores of the lake are bongo antelope, red river hog, greater kudu, Ugandan kob, roan antelope, and other forest animals.
Species of note in the open enclosures include two subspecies of giraffe, rhinos (it was the last New World zoo to have northern white rhinoceros), vultures, markhor, and many species of antelope, gazelle, and deer. The park houses the largest, most comprehensive collection of hoofed mammals (ungulates) in the world. However, the overall numbers of animals at the park have been greatly reduced.

=== Tiger Trail ===
The Sumatran tigers, Denver and Rakan (male), Majel, Cathy, Debbie, and Diana, have three different exhibits, and there is a glass viewing window for visitors. After raising $19.6 million for the new exhibit ground was broken on December 12, 2012. The new exhibit is named the Tull Family Tiger Trail after movie producer Thomas Tull and his wife. Tiger Trail opened May 24, 2014. In August 2017, a Bengal tiger cub named Moka was rescued by border police from a car on the Mexican border and brought to the zoo. 
The exhibits&#x27; matriarch, Delta, was euthanized on July 29, 2018, shortly after her birthday, due to old age. Her daughter, Joanna, succeeded her as the matriarch until June 30, 2021 when she was relocated to the Phoenix Zoo. 

On July 12, 2023, Diana gave birth to two Sumatran tigers named Hutan and Puteri. Puteri means &quot;princess&quot; in Malay, the official language of Malaysia — one of few Asian territories where the Sumatran tigers can be found. Hutan is Malay for “forest.

=== Nairobi Village and Gorilla Forest ===
Originally a center for cultural events in the park, today Nairobi Village houses numerous exhibits for smaller animals. Among these are meerkats, Rodrigues fruit bats, an African aviary, ring-tailed lemurs, Chilean flamingos, pudú, fennec foxes Kirk&#x27;s dik-diks, sand cats, yellow-backed duikers, red river hogs, West African crowned cranes, North Sulawesi babirusa, South American coatis, lesser hedgehog tenrecs, black-footed cats, pancake tortoises and white-fronted bee-eaters. A large lagoon is home to numerous species of waterfowl, both foreign and native. Lorikeet Landing and Hidden Jungle display feedable lories and lorikeets, and African birds, respectively. There is a nursery where visitors can watch baby animals being hand-reared as well as a nearby petting corral. Finally, a habitat houses a troop of western lowland gorillas. In 2014, Imami gave birth to Joanne despite a respiratory problem. She and Joanne were treated for 11 days.

In 2019 medical experts collaborated to do cataract surgery on a three-year-old gorilla, Leslie. This was the park&#x27;s first cataract surgery on a gorilla.

In January 2021, two gorillas were reported to be the first known cases of COVID-19 transmission from humans to apes during the coronavirus pandemic. The gorillas recovered from the virus.

=== Hidden Jungle ===
Located in Nairobi Village, this climate-controlled indoor exhibit opened in 1993 and displays tropical African birds and insects. The entrance to the building is a simulated earthen crevasse with displays for stick insects, spiders, scorpions, insects, millipedes, lizards, and snakes. The underground segment opens up to a room representing the rainforest understory, which leads to a second room representing the canopy. On display are long-tailed paradise whydah, purple grenadier, red-crested turaco, African pygmy goose, beautiful sunbird and other birds.

Hidden Jungle is the setting of the annual &quot;Butterfly Jungle&quot; event.

=== Lion Camp ===
Opened in October 2004, Lion Camp houses the park&#x27;s six African lions, Izu, Mina, Oshana and Etosha in a exhibit. The park&#x27;s two other lions, Ernest and Miss Ellen, were moved to the San Diego Zoo. One side of the enclosure is dominated by an artificial rock kopje which has a glass viewing window and heated rocks. The path continues along an acacia-studded ravine and leads to a replica observation tent. This has a smaller viewing window as well as a Land Rover for the lions to rest on.

=== Condor Ridge ===
Condor Ridge displays endangered North American desert wildlife. The featured species are California condors and desert bighorn sheep. The park is noted for its breeding program; it was the key force in the recovery effort for the birds. It is one of the only places in the world where the public can see the species in captivity) Other species displayed include Aplomado falcons, San Clemente loggerhead shrikes, thick-billed parrots, ocelots, bald eagles, Harris&#x27;s hawks, squirrels, burrowing owls, prairie dogs, black footed ferrets, magpies, and desert tortoises.

=== African Woods and African Outpost ===
Formerly known as Heart of Africa, these are two of the park&#x27;s major exhibits. Visitors go down a trail which replicates habitats in Africa. The exhibit begins in African Woods with scrub animals - vultures, lesser kudu, and giant eland. It then progresses to the forest (okapi, red-flanked duikers, gerenuk, steenbok, demoiselle cranes, kori bustard, blue cranes, and wattled cranes). The path then leads to African Outpost, which features plains animals - bontebok, warthogs, bat-eared foxes, secretary birds, yellow-billed storks, ground hornbills, cheetahs, and nyala - against a backdrop of the open-range East Africa exhibit. A central lagoon has lesser and greater flamingos, waterfowl, an island with colobus monkeys, and an interpretive research camp on a separate island.

=== Tours and rides ===
The park formerly operated a monorail line, the Wgasa Bush Line, which ran clockwise through the Wild Animal Park. The name of the monorail was originally chosen by chief designer Chuck Faust as a profane inside joke, with &quot;WGASA&quot; being an acronym for &quot;who gives a shit anyway&quot;. Zoo officials later came up with a backronym for the name, saying that it stood for &quot;World’s Greatest Animal Show Anywhere&quot;.

The Monorail line has been retired, partially due to high maintenance costs, and in March 2007 the Journey into Africa attraction, now renamed Africa Tram, opened. The Africa Tram tour runs counterclockwise and brings visitors to the field exhibits to see wildlife from different parts of Africa. In addition, another route is planned to bring visitors through the Asian field exhibits and into eight new ones that will house a variety of African animals from rock hyrax to Hartmann&#x27;s mountain zebras. The tour uses a wheeled tram that runs on biofuel instead of a monorail.

As well as the tram, the park has also added a tethered balloon ride that allows visitors to see the plains exhibits from (~21 giraffes) in the air. The balloon ride is not included in the entrance fee.

=== Gardens ===
The park also has extensive botanical gardens, many of which are their own attractions separate from the animal exhibits.

=== Walkabout Australia ===
Walkabout Australia is the park&#x27;s only Australia exhibit. It is 3.6 acres and guests can go inside an exhibit which features western grey kangaroos, red-necked wallabies, Australian brushturkeys, radjah shelducks, freckled ducks and magpie geese. Walkabout Australia also has two southern cassowary exhibits, a Matschie&#x27;s tree-kangaroo exhibit and an animal ambassador area where guests can meet the safari park&#x27;s Australian animal ambassadors. Walkabout Australia also has a restaurant and a devil&#x27;s marbles area. It is also home to the only two platypuses outside of Australia, Birrarung and Eve. The exhibit opened in 2018.

==Conservation==
The park includes the world&#x27;s largest veterinary hospital. Adjacent to the hospital is the Institute for Conservation Research, which houses the San Diego Zoo&#x27;s and Safari Park&#x27;s Frozen Zoo. The park is Southern California&#x27;s quarantine center for zoo animals imported into the United States through San Diego. 

The safari park was a major factor in the recovery of the California condor. Beginning in 1980, it worked with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Los Angeles Zoo to start a captive breeding program. The last 22 condors were taken into captivity in 1987 To breed the condors quickly, the Safari Park would remove the eggs from the nests to induce the females to lay a second egg. The removed egg hatches in an incubator and is raised with a condor handpuppet to prevent human imprinting, while the second egg is raised by its parents. The first condor born through this process is Siscouc, a male condor, who was the patriarch of the flock (last chick, Kitwon). Now that title goes to Siwon. Captive-bred condors were reintroduced into the wild beginning in 1992, and today their population 500, with 200 in the wild as of November 2020.

On December 14, 2014, Angalifu, a 44-year-old male northern white rhinoceros, died of old age at the park. This left only five northern white rhinos left in the world, including one female at the Safari Park.
On November 22, 2015, the park&#x27;s last northern white rhino, 41-year-old Nola, was euthanized due to bacterial infection and her health rapidly failing.

In June 2019, two young male African elephants named Ingadze and Lutsandvo were sent to Alabama&#x27;s Birmingham Zoo as part of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums&#x27; Species Survival Plan.
On 28 July 2019, the zoo announced the birth of Edward, a male Southern White Rhinoceros, the first rhino in North America born through artificial insemination, born to Victoria and Maoto. The second rhino born through artificial insemination, Future, a female southern White rhinoceros, was also born in the park. On August 12, 2018, the zoo announced the birth of Zuli, a male elephant born to Ndula, the largest calf born at the zoo, of 299 pounds. The record was broken six weeks later by Kaia, a female elephant born to Umngani, at 320 pounds.

== Awards ==

The Safari Park has received several awards for its breeding programs and conservation efforts.

<text>Moustapha al Akkad (; July 1, 1930 – November 11, 2005) was a Syrian-American film producer and director, best known for producing the original series of &quot;Halloween&quot; films and directing &quot;The Message&quot; and &quot;Lion of the Desert&quot;. He was killed along with his daughter Rima Al Akkad Monla in the 2005 Amman bombings. He is also the cousin to television personality star Tareq Salahi.

==Early life==
Al Akkad was born on July 1, 1930, in Aleppo in the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon. He received his high school degree from the Aleppo American College. His father, then a customs officer, gave him $200 and a copy of the Quran before he left for the United States to study film direction and production at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Akkad spent a further three years studying for a Master&#x27;s degree at the University of Southern California (USC), where he met the director Sam Peckinpah. Peckinpah became Akkad&#x27;s mentor in Hollywood and hired him as a consultant for a film about the Algerian War that never made it to the big screen, but he continued to encourage him until he found a job as a producer at CBS.

==Career==
In 1976, he produced and directed &quot;Mohammad, Messenger of God&quot; (released as &quot;The Message&quot; in 1977 in the United States), starring Anthony Quinn and Irene Papas. Akkad faced resistance from Hollywood, which forced him to make the film in Morocco.

While creating &quot;Muhammad, Messenger of God&quot;, he consulted Islamic clerics, he wanted and tried to be respectful towards Islam and its views on portraying Muhammad. He got the Approval from Al-Azhar University in Egypt but was rejected by the Muslim World League in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The Governments of Kuwait, Libya and Morocco promised to support the film financially, and when it was rejected by the Muslim World League, Kuwait kept its financial support but stopped other kinds of supports. King Hassan II of Morocco gave his full support for the production of the film. The production took one year, Akkad filmed for 6 months in Morocco, but had to stop when the Saudi Government exerted great pressure on the government of Morocco to stop the production. Akkad went to Muammar Gaddafi of Libya for support in order to complete the project, Gaddafi allowed him to move the filming to Libya for the remaining 6 months until the film was finalized.

Akkad saw the film as a way to bridge the gap between the Western and Muslim worlds, stating in a 1976 interview:

In 1978, he helped make low-budget film history when he produced &quot;Halloween&quot;. Akkad became best known for his key involvement in the first eight &quot;Halloween&quot; films, as an executive producer (the only producer to participate in all of these films). The series was highly profitable and hugely influential to subsequent horror films. 

In 1980 he directed &quot;Lion of the Desert&quot;, in which Quinn and Irene Papas were joined by Oliver Reed, Rod Steiger, and John Gielgud. It was about the real-life Bedouin leader Omar Mukhtar (Quinn), who fought Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Italian troops in the deserts of Libya. The movie is now critically acclaimed, after initially receiving negative publicity in the West for being partially funded by Libya&#x27;s Muammar Gaddafi, who invested $35 million in the movie. This negative publicity may have been the cause of its relatively poor performance at the box office. Clint Morris describes the movie as: &quot;A grand epic adventure that&#x27;ll stand as a highpoint in the producing career of Moustapha Akkad.&quot; In 1985, his production company Trancas International Films had inked an agreement with Galaxy International releasing in order to release films for a seven-picture agreement worldwide.

In the United Kingdom, Akkad once tried to buy Pinewood Studios from The Rank Organisation and also had a studio at Twickenham. At the time of his death, he was in the process of producing an $80 million movie featuring Sean Connery about Saladin and the Crusades, for which he already had the script, that would be filmed in Jordan. Speaking of the film, he said:
==Death==
Akkad and his 34-year-old daughter, Rima Akkad Monla, were killed in the 2005 Amman bombings. They were both in the lobby at the Grand Hyatt Amman on November 9 when a bomb exploded; his daughter died instantly, and Akkad died of his injuries two days later in a hospital. He is buried in the Al-Jadidah Cemetery in Aleppo in Syria.

Akkad was survived by his former wife, Patricia Al Akkad and their sons, Taric and Malek, who helped produce most of the &quot;Halloween&quot; movies, as well as his widow, Suha Ascha Akkad, and their son Zade.

==Legacy==
He was honoured by his native city of Aleppo, and the Aleppo City Council has renamed a school and a street after Moustapha Akkad. In 2008, a street in downtown Beirut was renamed after Moustapha Akkad. The 2007 remake of &quot;Halloween&quot; was dedicated to Moustapha Akkad. The 2018 film &quot;Halloween&quot;, a direct sequel to the 1978 original film, also features a dedication to Akkad in the end credits.

<text>A service club or service organization is a voluntary nonprofit organization where members meet regularly to perform charitable works either by direct hands-on efforts or by raising money for other organizations. A service club is defined firstly by its service mission and secondly by its membership benefits, such as social occasions, networking, and personal growth opportunities that encourage involvement.

Service organizations are not necessarily exclusive of ideological motives, although organizations with such defined motives are more likely to identify themselves through their association. Much like the historical religious organizations that formed the basis for many societal institutions, such as hospitals, service organizations perform many essential services for their community and other worthy causes. In the United States, some of these clubs usually also have a component club organization that is a tax exempt 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.

Many of today&#x27;s service clubs started as social clubs for business networking, but quickly evolved into organizations devoted more to service than to networking, although networking may still be the primary reason many members decided to join.

Historically, most service clubs consist of community-based groups with the same name, goals, membership requirements, and meeting structure. Many of these clubs meet weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly on a recurring established day and time, commonly at mealtime. Most of these clubs started with a single club in a single city but then replicated themselves by organizing similar clubs in other communities. Many of the service club organizations have become worldwide movements, and have obtained official recognition by the United Nations and various governments as non-governmental organizations (NGO).

<text>Melissa Sue Anderson (born September 26, 1962) is an American-Canadian actress. She began her career as a child actress after appearing in several commercials in Los Angeles. Anderson is known for her role as Mary Ingalls in the NBC drama series &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; (1974–1983), for which she received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series.

She is also known for film roles that include Vivian in &quot;Midnight Offerings&quot; (1981), Ginny in the slasher film &quot;Happy Birthday to Me&quot; (1981), and Alex in the &quot;ABC Afterschool Special&quot;, &quot;Which Mother Is Mine?&quot; (1979).

Anderson became a naturalized citizen of Canada in 2007. In 2010, she published &quot;The Way I See It: A Look Back at My Life on Little House&quot;, an autobiographical account of her years acting in &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;.

==Early life==
Anderson was born on September 26, 1962, in Berkeley, California, the second of two daughters, to James and Marion Anderson. Her sister Maureen is 12 years her senior. When she was seven years old, Anderson&#x27;s family relocated from the San Francisco Bay Area to Los Angeles. Her parents divorced when she was 13 years old, and she was raised Roman Catholic by her mother. As a young child, Anderson appeared in commercials for Mattel and Sears.

==Career==
Anderson&#x27;s show-business career began when a dance teacher urged her parents to find an agent for her. After appearing in commercials, she was soon in demand for television roles. Another memorable early role was as Millicent, a girl who kissed Bobby in &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;. She also appeared in an episode of &quot;Shaft&quot; the same year.

At the age of 11, Anderson landed the role of Mary Ingalls in &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;. She would go on to star in the series for eight seasons, beginning in 1974, and leaving after season seven; she later appeared in three episodes of season eight in late 1981.
In 1976, Michael Landon asked Anderson if she would appear in his autobiographical film &quot;The Loneliest Runner&quot;. Anderson agreed to play Nancy Rizzi, the first girlfriend of John Curtis (based on Landon and played by Lance Kerwin), saying she was very thrilled to have been asked. In 1977, she once again co-starred as the love interest opposite Kerwin in the television film &quot;James at 15&quot;.

She was nominated for a 1978 Primetime Emmy Award for Best Leading Actress in a Drama Series for her work on &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; and won the Emmy Award for her performance in &quot;Which Mother Is Mine?&quot;, which aired as an &quot;ABC Afterschool Special&quot; in 1979. Also in 1979, she played the title role of Dana Lee Gilbert, a North Dakota transfer student to Los Angeles&#x27; San Fernando Valley, in CBS&#x27;s television film &quot;Survival of Dana&quot;.

In 1980, Anderson earned a &#x27;TP de Oro&#x27; Award (considered to be Spain&#x27;s most prestigious award for television) for &#x27;Best Foreign Actress&#x27; for her role in &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;. This followed a successful visit to Spain in 1979 to appear as a guest on &#x27;s program, &quot;625 Lineas&quot;. In 1981, she earned a Young Artist Award nomination for her performance in the Canadian slasher film &quot;Happy Birthday to Me&quot;. After leaving &quot;Little House&quot;, she continued acting in television series like &quot;The Equalizer&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;CHiPs&quot;, and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, and was the associate producer for the penultimate television project Michael Landon made before dying: &quot;Where Pigeons Go to Die&quot; (1990).

In 1998, she was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In 1999, she starred alongside Heather Langenkamp in the short-lived television series &quot;Partners&quot;. In 2014, Anderson had an uncredited appearance as Stosh&#x27;s mother in the neo-noir mystery comedy drama film &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; (2014).

==Book==
In 2010, Anderson released an autobiography titled &quot;The Way I See It: A Look Back at My Life on Little House&quot;. The book, which is primarily based on her life during her years as a child star in &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, contains behind-the-scenes stories and anecdotes about the show itself, its stars, guest stars, and crew members. The autobiography also covers her pre– and post–&quot;Little House&quot; career, her side-projects during the &quot;Little House&quot; years and how her personal life was affected by her career.

==Personal life==
Anderson married television writer and producer Michael Sloan in 1990. They have two children, daughter Piper and son Griffin. The family moved to Montreal in 2002 and became naturalized Canadians on Canada Day in 2007.

<doc id="36911" wikidata="Q114280" url="?curid=36911" title="Antipater of Sidon">
<text>Antipater of Sidon (Greek: Ἀντίπατρος ὁ Σιδώνιος, &quot;Antipatros ho Sidonios&quot;) was an ancient Greek poet of the 2nd and 1st centuries BC.

Cicero mentions him living in Rome during the time of Quintus Lutatius Catulus, and calls him a brilliant epigrammist, sometimes too fond of imitation. His poems, about 75 of which are preserved in the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot;, are mostly epitaphs and ecphrastic poems. 96 poems in the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot; are attributed simply to &quot;Antipater&quot;, without an indication of whether they are by Antipater of Sidon or the later Antipater of Thessalonica, and it is difficult to identify which are his.

One of his poems gives one of the earliest known lists of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.

I have set eyes on the wall of lofty Babylon on which is a road for chariots, and the statue of Zeus by the Alpheus, and the hanging gardens, and the Colossus of the Sun, and the huge labour of the high pyramids, and the vast tomb of Mausolus; but when I saw the house of Artemis that mounted to the clouds, those other marvels lost their brilliancy, and I said, &quot;Lo, apart from Olympus, the Sun never looked on aught so grand.&quot;

<text>The arabesque is a form of artistic decoration consisting of &quot;surface decorations based on rhythmic linear patterns of scrolling and interlacing foliage, tendrils&quot; or plain lines, often combined with other elements. Another definition is &quot;Foliate ornament, used in the Islamic world, typically using leaves, derived from stylised half-palmettes, which were combined with spiralling stems&quot;. It usually consists of a single design which can be &#x27;tiled&#x27; or seamlessly repeated as many times as desired. Within the very wide range of Eurasian decorative art that includes motifs matching this basic definition, the term &quot;arabesque&quot; is used consistently as a technical term by art historians to describe only elements of the decoration found in two phases: Islamic art from about the 9th century onwards, and European decorative art from the Renaissance onwards. Interlace and scroll decoration are terms used for most other types of similar patterns.

Arabesques are a fundamental element of Islamic art. The past and current usage of the term in respect of European art is confused and inconsistent. Some Western arabesques derive from Islamic art, however others are closely based on ancient Roman decorations. In the West they are essentially found in the decorative arts, but because of the generally non-figurative nature of Islamic art, arabesque decoration is often a very prominent element in the most significant works, and plays a large part in the decoration of architecture.

Claims are often made regarding the theological significance of the arabesque and its origin in a specifically Islamic view of the world; however, these are without support from written historical sources since, like most medieval cultures, the Islamic world has not left us documentation of their intentions in using the decorative motifs they did. At the popular level such theories often appear uninformed as to the wider context of the arabesque. In similar fashion, proposed connections between the arabesque and Arabic knowledge of geometry remains a subject of debate; not all art historians are persuaded that such knowledge had reached, or was needed by, those creating arabesque designs, although in certain cases there is evidence that such a connection did exist. The case for a connection with Islamic mathematics is much stronger for the development of the geometric patterns with which arabesques are often combined in art. Geometric decoration often uses patterns that are made up of straight lines and regular angles that somewhat resemble curvilinear arabesque patterns; the extent to which these too are described as arabesque varies between different writers.

== Islamic arabesque ==
The Islamic arabesque was probably invented in Baghdad around the 10th century. It first appeared as a distinctive and original development in Islamic art in carved marble panels from around this time.
What makes Islamic arabesque unique and distinct from vegetal decorations of other cultures is its infinite correspondence and the fact that it can be extended beyond its actual limits. The arabesque developed out of the long-established traditions of plant-based scroll ornament in the cultures taken over by the early Islamic conquests. Early Islamic art, for example in the famous 8th-century mosaics of the Great Mosque of Damascus, often contained plant-scroll patterns, in that case by Byzantine artists in their usual style. The plants most often used are stylized versions of the acanthus, with its emphasis on leafy forms, and the vine, with an equal emphasis on twining stems. The evolution of these forms into a distinctive Islamic type was complete by the 11th century, having begun in the 8th or 9th century in works like the Mshatta Facade. In the process of development the plant forms became increasingly simplified and stylized. The relatively abundant survivals of stucco reliefs from the walls of palaces (but not mosques) in Abbasid Samarra, the Islamic capital between 836 and 892, provide examples of three styles, Styles A, B, and C, though more than one of these may appear on the same wall, and their chronological sequence is not certain. 
Though the broad outline of the process is generally agreed, there is a considerable diversity of views held by specialist scholars on detailed issues concerning the development, categorization and meaning of the arabesque. The detailed study of Islamic arabesque forms was begun by Alois Riegl in his formalist study &quot;Stilfragen: Grundlegungen zu einer Geschichte der Ornamentik&quot; (&quot;Problems of style: foundations for a history of ornament&quot;) of 1893, who in the process developed his influential concept of the &quot;Kunstwollen&quot;. Riegl traced formalistic continuity and development in decorative plant forms from ancient Egyptian art and other ancient Near Eastern civilizations through the classical world to the Islamic arabesque. While the &quot;Kunstwollen&quot; has few followers today, his basic analysis of the development of forms has been confirmed and refined by the wider &quot;corpus&quot; of examples known today. Jessica Rawson has recently extended the analysis to cover Chinese art, which Riegl did not cover, tracing many elements of Chinese decoration back to the same tradition, the shared background helping make the assimilation of Chinese motifs into Persian art after the Mongol invasion harmonious and productive.

Many arabesque patterns disappear at (or &quot;under&quot;, as it often appears to a viewer) a framing edge without ending and thus can be regarded as infinitely extendable outside the space they actually occupy; this was certainly a distinctive feature of the Islamic form, though not without precedent. Most but not all foliage decoration in the preceding cultures terminated at the edge of the occupied space, although infinitely repeatable patterns in foliage are very common in the modern world in wallpaper and textiles.

Typically, in earlier forms there is no attempt at realism; no particular species of plant is being imitated, and the forms are often botanically impossible or implausible. &quot;Leaf&quot; forms typically spring sideways from the stem, in what is often called a &quot;half-palmette&quot; form, named after its distant and very different looking ancestor in ancient Egyptian and Greek ornament. New stems spring from leaf-tips, a type often called honeysuckle, and the stems often have no tips, winding endlessly out of the space. The early Mshatta Facade is recognisably some sort of vine, with conventional leaves on the end of short stalks and bunches of grapes or berries, but later forms usually lack these. Flowers are rare until about 1500, after which they appear more often, especially in Ottoman art, and are often identifiable by species. In Ottoman art the large and feathery leaves called &quot;saz&quot; became very popular, and were elaborated in drawings showing just one or more large leaves. Eventually floral decoration mostly derived from Chinese styles, especially those of Chinese porcelain, replaces the arabesque in many types of work, such as pottery, textiles and miniatures.

=== Significance in Islam ===
The arabesques and geometric patterns of Islamic art are often said to arise from the Islamic view of the world (see above). The depiction of animals and people is generally discouraged, which explains the preference for abstract geometric patterns.

There are two modes to arabesque art. The first mode recalls the principles that govern the order of the world. These principles include the bare basics of what makes objects structurally sound and, by extension, beautiful (i.e. the angle and the fixed/static shapes that it creates—esp. the truss). In the first mode, each repeating geometric form has a built-in symbolism ascribed to it. For example, the square, with its four equilateral sides, is symbolic of the equally important elements of nature: earth, air, fire and water. Without any one of the four, the physical world, represented by a circle that inscribes the square, would collapse upon itself and cease to exist. The second mode is based upon the flowing nature of plant forms. This mode recalls the feminine nature of life giving. In addition, upon inspection of the many examples of Arabesque art, some would argue that there is in fact a third mode, the mode of Islamic calligraphy.

Instead of recalling something related to the &#x27;True Reality&#x27; (the reality of the spiritual world), Islam considers calligraphy a visible expression of the highest art of all; the art of the spoken word (the transmittal of thoughts and of history). In Islam, the most important document to be transmitted orally is the Qur&#x27;an. Proverbs and complete passages from the Qur&#x27;an can be seen today in Arabesque art. The coming together of these three forms creates the Arabesque, and this is a reflection of unity arising from diversity; a basic tenet of Islam.

The arabesque may be equally thought of as both art and science. The artwork is at the same time mathematically precise, aesthetically pleasing, and symbolic. Due to this duality of creation, the artistic part of this equation may be further subdivided into both secular and religious artwork. However, for many Muslims there is no distinction; all forms of art, the natural world, mathematics and science are seen to be creations of God and therefore reflections of the same thing: God&#x27;s will expressed through his creation. In other words, man can discover the geometric forms that constitute the arabesque, but these forms always existed before as part of God&#x27;s creation, as shown in this picture.

There is great similarity between arabesque artwork from very different geographic regions. In fact, the similarities are so pronounced that it is sometimes difficult for experts to tell where a given style of arabesque comes from. The reason for this is that the science and mathematics that are used to construct Arabesque artwork are universal. Therefore, for most Muslims, the best artwork that can be created by man for use in the Mosque is artwork that displays the underlying order and unity of nature. The order and unity of the material world, they believe, is a mere ghostly approximation of the spiritual world, which for many Muslims is the place where the only true reality exists. Discovered geometric forms, therefore, exemplify this perfect reality because God&#x27;s creation has been obscured by the sins of man.

Mistakes in repetitions may be intentionally introduced as a show of humility by artists who believe only Allah can produce perfection, although this theory is disputed.
Arabesque art consists of a series of repeating geometric forms which are occasionally accompanied by calligraphy. Ettinghausen et al. describe the arabesque as a &quot;vegetal design consisting of full...and half palmettes [as] an unending continuous pattern...in which each leaf grows out of the tip of another.&quot; To the adherents of Islam, the Arabesque is symbolic of their united faith and the way in which traditional Islamic cultures view the world.

==Terminology and Western arabesque==

Arabesque is a French term derived from the Italian word &quot;arabesco&quot;, meaning &quot;in the Arabic style&quot;. The term was first used in Italian, where &quot;rabeschi&quot; was used in the 16th century as a term for &quot;pilaster ornaments featuring acanthus decoration&quot;, specifically &quot;running scrolls&quot; that ran vertically up a panel or pilaster, rather than horizontally along a frieze.

According to Ralph Nicholson Wornum in 1882: &quot;The western arabesque which appeared in the 15th century derived from Roman remains of the early time of the empire, not to any style derived from Arabian or Moorish work. Arabesque and Moresque are really distinct; the latter is from the Arabian style of ornament, developed by the Byzantine Greeks for their new masters, after the conquests of the followers of Mahomet; and the former is a term pretty well restricted to varieties of cinquecento decoration, which have nothing in common with any Arabian examples in their details, but are a development derived from Greek and Roman grotesque designs, such as we find them in the remains of ancient palaces at Rome, and in ancient houses at Pompeii. These were reproduced by Raphael and his pupils in the decoration of some of the corridors of the Loggie of the Vatican at Rome: grotesque is thus a better name for these decorations than Arabesque. This technical Arabesque, therefore, is much more ancient than any Arabian or Moorish decoration, and has really nothing in common with it except the mere symmetrical principles of its arrangement. Pliny and Vitruvius give us no name for the extravagant decorative wall-painting in vogue in their time, to which the early Italian revivers of it seem to have given the designation of grotesque, because it, was first discovered in the arched or underground chambers (grotte) of Roman ruins—as in the golden house of Nero, or the baths of Titus. What really took place in the Italian revival was in some measure a supplanting of the Arabesque for the classical grotesque, still retaining the original Arabian designation, while the genuine Arabian art, the Saracenic, was distinguished as Moresque or Moorish.&quot;

The book &quot;Opera nuova che insegna a le donne a cuscire … laqual e intitolata Esempio di raccammi&quot; (A New Work that Teaches Women how to Sew … Entitled &quot;Samples of Embroidery&quot;), published in Venice in 1530, includes &quot;groppi moreschi e rabeschi&quot;, Moorish knots and arabesques.

From there it spread to England, where Henry VIII owned, according to an inventory of 1549, an agate cup with a &quot;fote and Couer of siluer and guilt enbossed with Rebeske worke&quot;, and William Herne or Heron, Serjeant Painter from 1572 to 1580, was paid for painting Elizabeth I&#x27;s barge with &quot;rebeske work&quot;. The styles so described can only be guessed at, although the design by Hans Holbein for a covered cup for Jane Seymour in 1536 (see gallery) already has zones in both Islamic-derived arabesque/moresque style (see below) and classically derived acanthus volutes.

Another related term is moresque, meaning &quot;Moorish&quot;; Randle Cotgrave&#x27;s &quot;A Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues&quot; of 1611 defines this as: &quot;a rude or anticke painting, or carving, wherin the feet and tayles of beasts, &amp;c, are intermingled with, or made to resemble, a kind of wild leaves, &amp;c.&quot; and &quot;arabesque&quot;, in its earliest use cited in the OED (but as a French word), as &quot;Rebeske work; a small and curious flourishing&quot;. In France &quot;arabesque&quot; first appears in 1546, and &quot;was first applied in the latter part of the 17th century&quot; to grotesque ornament, &quot;despite the classical origin of the latter&quot;, especially if without human figures in it—a distinction still often made, but not consistently observed.

Over the following centuries, the three terms &quot;grotesque&quot;, &quot;moresque&quot;, and &quot;arabesque&quot; were used largely interchangeably in English, French, and German for styles of decoration derived at least as much from the European past as the Islamic world, with &quot;grotesque&quot; gradually acquiring its main modern meaning, related more to Gothic gargoyles and caricature than to either Pompeii-style Roman painting or Islamic patterns. Meanwhile, the word &quot;arabesque&quot; was now being applied to Islamic art itself, by 1851 at the latest, when John Ruskin uses it in &quot;The Stones of Venice&quot;. Writers over the last decades have attempted to salvage meaningful distinctions between the words from the confused wreckage of historical sources.

Peter Fuhring, a specialist in the history of ornament, says that (also in a French context): The ornament known as moresque in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries (but now more commonly called arabesque) is characterized by bifurcated scrolls composed of branches forming interlaced foliage patterns. These basic motifs gave rise to numerous variants, for example, where the branches, generally of a linear character, were turned into straps or bands. ... It is characteristic of the moresque, which is essentially a surface ornament, that it is impossible to locate the pattern&#x27;s beginning or end. ... Originating in the Middle East, they were introduced to continental Europe via Italy and Spain ... Italian examples of this ornament, which was often used for bookbindings and embroidery, are known from as early as the late fifteenth century.

Fuhring notes that grotesques were &quot;confusingly called arabesques in eighteenth century France&quot;, but in his terminology &quot;the major types of ornament that appear in French sixteenth century etchings and engraving ... can be divided into two groups. The first includes ornaments adopted from antiquity: grotesques, architectural ornaments such as the orders, foliage scrolls and self-contained elements such as trophies, terms and vases. A second group, far smaller than the first, comprises modern ornaments: moresques, interlaced bands, strapwork, and elements such as cartouches&quot;—categories he goes on to discuss individually.

The moresque or arabesque style was especially popular and long-lived in the Western arts of the book: bookbindings decorated in gold tooling, borders for illustrations, and printer&#x27;s ornaments for decorating empty spaces on the page. In this field the technique of gold tooling had also arrived in the 15th century from the Islamic world, and indeed much of the leather itself was imported from there. Small motifs in this style have continued to be used by conservative book designers up to the present day.

According to Harold Osborne, in France, the &quot;characteristic development of the French arabesque combined bandwork deriving from the moresque with decorative acanthus foliage radiating from C-scrolls connected by short bars&quot;. Apparently starting in embroidery, it then appears in garden design before being used in Northern Mannerist painted decorative schemes &quot;with a central medallion combined with acanthus and other forms&quot; by Simon Vouet and then Charles Lebrun who used &quot;scrolls of flat bandwork joined by horizontal bars and contrasting with ancanthus scrolls and palmette.&quot; More exuberant arabesque designs by Jean Bérain the Elder are an early &quot;intimation&quot; of the Rococo, which was to take the arabesque into three dimensions in reliefs.

The use of &quot;arabesque&quot; as an English noun first appears, in relation to painting, in William Beckford&#x27;s novel &quot;Vathek&quot; in 1786. Arabesque is also used as a term for complex freehand pen flourishes in drawing or other graphic media. The &quot;Grove Dictionary of Art&quot; will have none of this confusion, and says flatly: &quot;Over the centuries the word has been applied to a wide variety of winding and twining vegetal decoration in art and meandering themes in music, but it properly applies only to Islamic art&quot;, so contradicting the definition of 1888 still found in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;: &quot;A species of mural or surface decoration in colour or low relief, composed in flowing lines of branches, leaves, and scroll-work fancifully intertwined. Also fig[uratively]. As used in Moorish and Arabic decorative art (from which, almost exclusively, it was known in the Middle Ages), representations of living creatures were excluded; but in the arabesques of Raphael, founded on the ancient Græco-Roman work of this kind, and in those of Renaissance decoration, human and animal figures, both natural and grotesque, as well as vases, armour, and objects of art, are freely introduced; to this the term is now usually applied, the other being distinguished as Moorish Arabesque, or Moresque.&quot;

==Printing==
A major use of the arabesque style has been artistic printing, for example of book covers and page decoration. Repeating geometric patterns worked well with traditional printing, since they could be printed from metal type like letters if the type was placed together; as the designs have no specific connection to the meaning of a text, the type can be reused in many different editions of different works. Robert Granjon, a French printer of the sixteenth century, has been credited with the first truly interlocking arabesque printing, but other printers had used many other kinds of ornaments in the past. The idea was rapidly used by many other printers. After a period of disuse in the nineteenth century, when a more minimal page layout became popular with printers like Bodoni and Didot, the concept returned to popularity with the arrival of the Arts and Crafts movement, Many fine books from the period 1890–1960 have arabesque decorations, sometimes on paperback covers. Many digital serif fonts include arabesque pattern elements thought to be complementary to the mood of the font; they are also often sold as separate designs.

<doc id="36916" wikidata="Q208542" url="?curid=36916" title="Theotokos">
<text>Theotokos (Greek: ) is a title of Mary, mother of Jesus, used especially in Eastern Christianity. The usual Latin translations are or (approximately &quot;parent (fem.) of God&quot;). Familiar English translations are &quot;Mother of God&quot; or &quot;God-bearer&quot; – but these both have different literal equivalents in , and Θεοφόρος respectively.

The title has been in use since the 3rd century, in the Syriac tradition (as ) in the Liturgy of Mari and Addai (3rd century) and the Liturgy of St James (4th century). The Council of Ephesus in AD 431 decreed that Mary is the &quot;Theotokos&quot; because Her Son Jesus is both God and man: one divine person from two natures (divine and human) intimately and hypostatically united.

The title of Mother of God (Greek: ) or Mother of [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnate God]], abbreviated ΜΡ ΘΥ (the first and last letter of main two words in Greek), is most often used in English, largely due to the lack of a satisfactory equivalent of the Greek τόκος. For the same reason, the title is often left untranslated, as &quot;Theotokos&quot;, in Eastern liturgical usage of other languages.

&quot;Theotokos&quot; is also used as the term for an Eastern icon, or type of icon, of the Mother with Child (typically called a &quot;Madonna&quot; in western tradition), as in &quot;the Theotokos of Vladimir&quot; both for the original 12th-century icon and for icons that are copies or imitate its composition.

==Etymology==

Theotokos is an adjectival compound of two Greek words Θεός &quot;God&quot; and τόκος &quot;childbirth, parturition; offspring&quot;. A close paraphrase would be &quot;[she] whose offspring is God&quot; or &quot;[she] who gave birth to one who was God&quot;. The usual English translation is simply &quot;Mother of God&quot;; Latin uses &quot;Deipara&quot; or .

The Church Slavonic translation is &quot;Bogoroditsa&quot; (Russian/Serbian/Bulgarian ). The full title of Mary in Slavic Orthodox tradition is (Russian ), from Greek &quot;Our Most Holy Lady Theotokos and Ever-Virgin Mary&quot;. German has the translation &quot;Gottesgebärerin&quot; (lit. &quot;bearer of God&quot;). In Arabic, there are two main terms which are widely used at the general level, first one is: &quot;Walidatu-liilahi&quot; () and &quot;Ùmmu-&#x27;llahi&quot; or &quot;Ùmmu-l&#x27;iilahi&quot; (Arabic: أُمُّ ٱللهِ or أُمُّ ٱلْإِلَـٰهِ, lit.&#x27;Mother of God&#x27;).

&quot;Mother of God&quot; is the literal translation of a distinct title in Greek, Μήτηρ τοῦ Θεοῦ (translit. &quot;Mētēr tou Theou&quot;), a term which has an established usage of its own in traditional Orthodox and Catholic theological writing, hymnography, and iconography.
In an abbreviated form, (), it often is found on Eastern icons, where it is used to identify Mary. The Russian term is (also ).

Variant forms are the compounds
*Θεομήτωρ: 
*Μητρόθεος: 
*Θεογεννήτωρ: and
*Θεοκυήτωρ: , which are found in patristic and liturgical texts.

The theological dispute over the term concerned the term Θεός &quot;God&quot; vs. Χριστός &quot;Christ&quot;, and not τόκος (&quot;genitrix&quot;, &quot;bearer&quot;) vs. μήτηρ (&quot;mater&quot;, &quot;mother&quot;), and the two terms have been used as synonyms throughout Christian tradition. Both terms are known to have existed alongside one another since the early church, but it has been argued, even in modern times, that the term &quot;Mother of God&quot; is unduly suggestive of Godhead having its origin in Mary, imparting to Mary the role of a Mother Goddess. But this is an exact reiteration of the objection by Nestorius, resolved in the 5th century, to the effect that the term &quot;Mother&quot; expresses exactly the relation of Mary to the incarnate Son ascribed to Mary in Christian theology.

==Theology==
Theologically, the terms &quot;Mother of God&quot;, &quot;Mother of Incarnate God&quot; (and its variants) should not be taken to imply that Mary is the source of the divine nature of Jesus, who Christians believe existed with the Father from all eternity.

Within the Orthodox and Catholic tradition, &quot;Mother of God&quot; has not been understood, nor been intended to be understood, as referring to Mary as Mother of God &quot;from eternity&quot; — that is, as Mother of God the Father — but only with reference to the birth of Jesus, that is, the Incarnation.
To make it explicit, it is sometimes translated &quot;Mother of God Incarnate&quot;. (cf. the topic of Christology, and the titles of God the Son and Son of man).

The Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed of 381 affirmed the Christian faith on &quot;one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all worlds (æons)&quot;, that &quot;came down from heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary, and was made man&quot;. Since that time, the expression &quot;Mother of God&quot; referred to the Dyophysite doctrine of the hypostatic union, about the uniqueness with the twofold nature of Jesus Christ God, which is both human and divine (nature distincted, but not separable nor mixed). Since that time, Jesus was affirmed as true Man and true God from all eternity.

The status of Mary as &quot;Theotokos&quot; was a topic of theological dispute in the 4th and 5th centuries and was
the subject of the decree of the Council of Ephesus of 431 to the effect that, in opposition to those who denied Mary the title &quot;Theotokos&quot; (&quot;the one who gives birth to God&quot;) but called her &quot;Christotokos&quot; (&quot;the one who gives birth to Christ&quot;), Mary &quot;is&quot; &quot;Theotokos&quot; because her son Jesus is one person who is both God and man, divine and human. This decree created the Nestorian Schism. Cyril of Alexandria wrote, &quot;I am amazed that there are some who are entirely in doubt as to whether the holy Virgin should be called &quot;Theotokos&quot; or not. For if our Lord Jesus Christ is God, how is the holy Virgin who gave [Him] birth, not [&quot;Theotokos&quot;]?&quot; (Epistle 1, to the monks of Egypt; PG 77:13B). But the argument of Nestorius was that divine and human natures of Christ were distinct, and while Mary is evidently the &quot;Christotokos&quot; (bearer of Christ), it could be misleading to describe her as the &quot;bearer of God&quot;. At issue is the interpretation of the Incarnation, and the nature of the hypostatic union of Christ&#x27;s human and divine natures between Christ&#x27;s conception and birth.

Within the Orthodox doctrinal teaching on the economy of salvation, Mary&#x27;s identity, role, and status as &quot;Theotokos&quot; is acknowledged as indispensable. For this reason, it is formally defined as official dogma. The only other Mariological teaching so defined is that of her virginity. Both of these teachings have a bearing on the identity of Jesus Christ. By contrast, certain other Marian beliefs which do not bear directly on the doctrine concerning the person of Jesus (for example, her sinlessness, the circumstances surrounding her conception and birth, her Presentation in the Temple, her continuing virginity following the birth of Jesus, and her death), which are taught and believed by the Orthodox Church (being expressed in the Church&#x27;s liturgy and patristic writings), are not formally defined by the Church.

==History of use==
===Early Church===
The term was certainly in use by the 4th century.
Athanasius of Alexandria in 330, Gregory the Theologian in 370, John Chrysostom in 400, and Augustine all used &quot;theotokos&quot;.

Origen (d. 254) is often cited as the earliest author to use &quot;theotokos&quot; for Mary (Socrates, &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; 7.32 (PG 67, 812 B) citing Origen&#x27;s &quot;Commentary on Romans&quot;), but the surviving texts do not contain it. It is also claimed that the term was used c. 250 by Dionysius of Alexandria, in an epistle to Paul of Samosata, but the epistle is a forgery of the 6th century.

The oldest preserved extant hymn dedicated to the Virgin Mary, Ὑπὸ τὴν σὴν εὐσπλαγχνίαν (English: &quot;Beneath thy Compassion,&quot; Latin: &quot;Sub tuum praesidium&quot;,) has been continually prayed and sung for at least sixteen centuries, in the original Koine Greek vocative, as ΘΕΟΤΟΚΕ. The oldest record of this hymn is a papyrus found in Egypt, mostly dated to after 450, but according to a suggestion by de Villiers (2011) possibly older, dating to the mid-3rd century.

John Cassian (360–435) wrote in his book about the Mother of God against Nestorian heresy of Christokos:

Basil of Caesarea (330-378) stated:

Augustine of Hippo (354-430) stated:

===Third Ecumenical Council===

The use of &quot;Theotokos&quot; was formally affirmed at the Third Ecumenical Council held at Ephesus in 431. It proclaimed that Mary truly became the Mother of God by the human conception of the Son of God in her womb:

The competing view, advocated by Patriarch Nestorius of Constantinople, was that Mary should be called &quot;Christotokos&quot;, meaning &quot;Birth-giver of Christ,&quot; to restrict her role to the mother of Christ&#x27;s humanity only and not his divine nature.

Nestorius&#x27; opponents, led by Cyril of Alexandria, viewed this as dividing Jesus into two distinct persons, the human who was Son of Mary, and the divine who was not. To them, this was unacceptable since by destroying the perfect union of the divine and human natures in Christ, it sabotaged the fullness of the Incarnation and, by extension, the salvation of humanity. The council accepted Cyril&#x27;s reasoning, affirmed the title &quot;Theotokos&quot; for Mary, and anathematized Nestorius&#x27; view as heresy. (See Nestorianism)

In letters to Nestorius which were afterwards included among the council documents, Cyril explained his doctrine. He noted that &quot;the holy fathers... have ventured to call the holy Virgin &quot;Theotokos&quot;, not as though the nature of the Word or his divinity received the beginning of their existence from the holy Virgin, but because from her was born his holy body, rationally endowed with a soul, with which the Word was united according to the hypostasis, and is said to have been begotten according to the flesh&quot; (Cyril&#x27;s second letter to Nestorius).

Explaining his rejection of Nestorius&#x27; preferred title for Mary (&quot;Christotokos&quot;), Cyril wrote:
===Nestorian schism===
The Nestorian Church, known as the Church of the East within the Syrian tradition, rejected the decision of the Council of Ephesus and its confirmation at the Council of Chalcedon in 451. This was the church of the Sasanian Empire during the late 5th and early 6th centuries. The schism ended in 544, when patriarch Aba I ratified the decision of Chalcedon. After this, there was no longer technically any &quot;Nestorian Church&quot;, i.e. a church following the doctrine of Nestorianism, although legends persisted that still further to the east such a church was still in existence (associated in particular with the figure of Prester John), and the label of &quot;Nestorian&quot; continued to be applied even though it was technically no longer correct. Modern research suggests that also the Church of the East in China did not teach a doctrine of two distinct natures of Christ.&quot;

===Reformation===
Lutheran tradition retained the title of &quot;Mother of God&quot; (German &quot;Mutter Gottes&quot;, &quot;Gottesmutter&quot;), a term already embraced by Martin Luther; and officially confessed in the Formula of Concord (1577), accepted by the Lutheran World Federation.

Whilst Calvin believed that Mary was theologically speaking rightly qualified as &quot;the mother of God&quot;, he rejected common use of this as a title, saying, &quot;I cannot think such language either right, or becoming, or suitable. ... To call the Virgin Mary the mother of God can only serve to confirm the ignorant in their superstitions.&quot;

===20th century===
In 1994, Pope John Paul II and Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East Mar Dinkha IV signed an ecumenical declaration, mutually recognizing the legitimacy of the titles &quot;Mother of God&quot; and &quot;Mother of Christ.&quot; The declaration reiterates the Christological formulations of the Council of Chalcedon as a theological expression of the faith shared by both Churches, at the same time respecting the preference of each Church in using these titles in their liturgical life and piety.

==Liturgy==
&quot;Theotokos&quot; is often used in hymns to Mary in the Eastern Orthodox, Eastern Catholic and Oriental Orthodox churches. The most common is &quot;Axion Estin&quot; (&quot;It is truly meet&quot;), which is used in nearly every service.

Other examples include &quot;Sub tuum praesidium&quot;, the &quot;Hail Mary&quot; in its Eastern form, and &quot;All creation rejoices&quot;, which replaces &quot;Axion Estin&quot; at the Divine Liturgy on the Sundays of Great Lent.
&quot;Bogurodzica&quot; is a medieval Polish hymn, possibly composed by Adalbert of Prague (d. 997).

The Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God is a Roman Catholic feast day introduced in 1969, based on older traditions associating 1 January with the motherhood of Mary.

==Iconography==

One of the two earliest known depictions of the Virgin Mary is found in the Catacomb of Priscilla (3rd century) showing the adoration of the Magi. Recent conservation work at the Catacombs of Priscilla revealed that what had been identified for decades as the earliest image of the Virgin and Child was actually a traditional funerary image of a Roman matron; the pointing figure with her, formerly identified as a prophet, was shown to have had its arm position adjusted and the star he was supposedly pointing to was painted in at a later date. The putative Annunciation scene at Priscilla is also now recognized as yet another Roman matron with accompanying figure and not the Virgin Mary. Recently another third-century image of the Virgin Mary was identified at the eastern Syrian site of Dura Europos in the baptistry room of the earliest known Christian Church. The scene shows the Annunciation to the Virgin.

The tradition of Marian veneration was greatly expanded only with the affirmation of her status as &quot;Theotokos&quot; in 431. The mosaics in Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, dating from 432 to 40, just after the council, does not yet show her with a halo. The iconographic tradition of the &quot;Theotokos&quot; or Madonna (Our Lady), showing the Virgin enthroned carrying the infant Christ, is established by the following century, as attested by a very small number of surviving icons, including one at Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery in Sinai, and Salus Populi Romani, a 5th or 6th-century Byzantine icon preserved in Rome. This type of depiction, with subtly changing differences of emphasis, has remained the mainstay of depictions of Mary to the present day. The roughly half-dozen varied icons of the Virgin and Child in Rome from the 6th to 8th centuries form the majority of the representations surviving from this period, as most early Byzantine icons were destroyed in the Byzantine Iconoclasm of the 8th and 9th century, notable exceptions being the 7th-century &quot;Blachernitissa&quot; and &quot;Agiosoritissa&quot;.

The iconographic tradition is well developed by the early medieval period. The tradition of Luke the Evangelist being the first to have painted Mary is established by the 8th century.

An early icon of the Virgin as queen is in the church of Santa Maria in Trastevere in Rome, datable to 705-707 by the kneeling figure of Pope John VII, a notable promoter of the cult of the Virgin, to whom the infant Christ reaches his hand.

The earliest surviving image in a Western illuminated manuscript of the Madonna and Child comes from the Book of Kells of about 800 (there is a similar carved image on the lid of St Cuthbert&#x27;s coffin of 698).
The oldest Russian icons were imports from Byzantium, beginning in the 11th century.

<text>Alain Marie Pascal Prost (; born 24 February 1955) is a French former racing driver and motorsport executive, who competed in Formula One from to . Nicknamed &quot;the Professor&quot;, Prost won four Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship titles and—at the time of his retirement—held the records for most wins (51), fastest laps (41), and podium finishes (106).

Born in Lorette, Loire, Prost began karting aged 14, winning the junior direct-drive Karting World Cup four years later, and progressing to junior formulae in 1976. Prost won his first title at the Formula Renault National Championship that year, prior to winning the Challenge de Formule Renault Europe in 1977. Replaced by the French Formula Three Championship the following season, he successfully defended his titles in 1978 and 1979. His junior career culminated in his victory at the 1979 FIA European Formula 3 Championship with Oreca. Prost signed for McLaren in , making his Formula One debut at the , where he finished sixth. He moved to Renault in , taking his maiden victory at his home Grand Prix in France, with further wins in the Netherlands and Italy. Following multiple race wins in his campaign with Renault, Prost finished runner-up to Nelson Piquet in the 1983 World Drivers&#x27; Championship after retiring with a turbo failure in the title-decider. Prost was sacked by Renault two days later for his post-season comments and moved back to McLaren for , where he finished runner-up to teammate Niki Lauda by a record half-point.

In , Prost won his maiden title with McLaren, becoming the first World Drivers&#x27; Champion from France. He successfully defended his title the following season, amidst a close title battle with Piquet and Nigel Mansell. After winning several races in his campaign, Prost was partnered by Ayrton Senna. Together, they won all Grands Prix bar one in —driving the Honda-powered MP4/4—with Senna taking the title by three points. Their fierce rivalry culminated in title-deciding collisions at Suzuka in 1989 and 1990, despite Prost&#x27;s move to Ferrari in the latter, with Prost winning the former championship and Senna taking the following. Amidst a winless campaign, he was sacked by Ferrari over comments made about the 643. After a year hiatus, Prost returned with Williams in , breaking several records on the way to his fourth championship and retiring at the end of the season. He returned to Formula One as the owner of Prost Grand Prix from to , having purchased Ligier. Prost held an advisory role at Renault—later re-branded as Alpine—from to .

After retiring from Formula One, Prost was a race-winner in the 2005 FFSA GT Championship, and entered the Race of Champions in 2010, representing France alongside Sébastien Loeb. In ice racing, Prost is a three-time champion of the Andros Trophy, competing from 2003 to 2012. He was the co-owner of Renault e.dams in Formula E until 2018, winning three consecutive Teams&#x27; Championships from 2014–15 to 2016–17. Prost was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1999.

==Early life==
Alain Prost was born in the commune of Lorette near the town of Saint-Chamond, in the département of Loire close to Saint-Étienne, France to André Prost and Marie-Rose Karatchian, born in France of Armenian descent. His father ran a furniture store. Prost had one older brother called Daniel, who died of cancer in September 1986. Prost was an active and athletic child, who enthusiastically took part in diverse sports, including wrestling, roller skating and football. In doing so he broke his nose several times. He considered careers as a gym instructor or a professional footballer before he discovered kart racing at the age of 14 while on a family holiday. This new sport quickly became his career of choice. At age 16, he bought his first kart with money he saved working for his father&#x27;s shop.

Prost won several karting championships in his teens. In 1974, he became a full-time racer. He won the French senior karting championship in 1975.

Prost made the transition to open-wheel racing in 1976 and rapidly progressed through the junior categories. That year, he dominated French Formula Renault, winning the title and all but one race. In 1977, he won the Formula Renault European championship. In 1978, he won the French Formula Three championship while simultaneously competing in the European Formula Three category. Finally, in 1979, he won both the European and French Formula Three titles. He also made three guest appearances in European Formula Two in 1977 and 1978.

Prost&#x27;s Formula Three wins drew interest from Formula One teams and sponsors. Before the final race of the 1979 season, Paddy McNally and John Hogan of Marlboro (McLaren&#x27;s lead sponsor) offered to cover the costs of a third McLaren car so that Prost could make an early Formula One debut, but Prost declined the cameo appearance, reasoning that it would be a mistake to debut in Formula One without being fully prepared: &quot;I didn&#x27;t know Watkins Glen and I didn&#x27;t know the car. I said I thought it would be a better idea to organise a test.&quot;

==Formula One==

===McLaren (1980)===
After winning the European Formula Three title, Prost was courted by Formula One teams McLaren, Brabham, and Ligier. After impressing McLaren team boss Teddy Mayer at a test drive, McLaren signed him for the 1980 season. He was paired with Ulsterman John Watson.

Prost&#x27;s career started promisingly. On his debut in Buenos Aires, he accomplished the rare achievement of scoring in his first race, earning one point for finishing sixth. From 1973 to 1993, only two other drivers earned points in their maiden race (Johnny Herbert and Jean Alesi). However, Prost finished 15th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with five points (one point behind the veteran Watson), scoring at Buenos Aires, Interlagos, Brands Hatch and Zandvoort. He had several accidents, breaking his wrist during practice at Kyalami and suffering a concussion during practice at Watkins Glen. He also retired from the previous round in Montreal a week earlier because of rear suspension failure.

At the end of the season, despite having two years remaining on his contract, he left McLaren and signed with Renault. Prost later explained that he left because the car frequently broke down and because he felt the team blamed him for several accidents. According to Watson, Mayer had initially wanted to sign Kevin Cogan but Marlboro insisted on Prost. Prost would not return to McLaren until 1984, after Ron Dennis assumed full control of the team.

===Renault (1981–1983)===
Prost was partnered with fellow Frenchman René Arnoux for . Motor sports author Nigel Roebuck reports that there were problems between Prost and Arnoux from the start of the season, Prost being immediately quicker than his more experienced teammate He did not finish the first two Grands Prix, due to collisions with Andrea de Cesaris in Long Beach and Didier Pironi at Jacarepaguá, but scored his first podium finish at Buenos Aires. He also did not finish in the next four races, and then won his first Formula One race at his home Grand Prix in France at the fast Dijon circuit, finishing two seconds ahead of his old teammate John Watson.

For Prost, his debut victory was memorable mostly for the change it made in his mindset. &quot;Before, you thought you could do it,&quot; he said. &quot;Now you know you can.&quot; Prost led from the start the next 5 races, and won two more races during the season, took his first pole position in Germany and finished on the podium every time he completed a race distance. He won again in Holland and Italy, and finished fifth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, seven points behind champion Nelson Piquet.

Prost won the first two Grands Prix of the 1982 season in South Africa, where Prost recovered from losing a wheel, and Brazil, where he finished 3rd but was awarded the win after Piquet (1st) and Keke Rosberg (2nd) were disqualified. He finished in the points on four other occasions, but did not win again. Despite retiring from seven races, Prost improved on his Drivers&#x27; Championship position, finishing in fourth, but with nine fewer points than the previous year. His relationship with Arnoux deteriorated further after the French Grand Prix. Prost believes that Arnoux, who won the race, went back on a pre-race agreement to support Prost during the race. His relationship with the French media was also poor. He has since commented that &quot;When I went to Renault the journalists wrote good things about me, but by 1982 I had become the bad guy. I think, to be honest, I had made the mistake of winning! The French don&#x27;t really like winners.&quot; He added that &quot;It&#x27;s hard to explain, but the French prefer martyrs who lose gloriously.&quot;

In November 1982, three years before it became a round of the F1 World Championship, Prost, along with fellow F1 drivers Jacques Laffite and Nelson Piquet, made the trip to Melbourne, Australia to drive in the non-championship 1982 Australian Grand Prix at the short (1.609 km (1.000 mi)) Calder Park Raceway. Driving a Formula Pacific spec Ralt RT4 powered by a 1.6 litre Ford engine, Prost sat on pole for the race with a time of 39.18. He then led every lap to win what would be the first of 3 Australian Grand Prix wins. He finished 15.32 seconds clear of Laffite, with 1981 Australian Grand Prix winner, young Brazilian driver Roberto Moreno finishing third.
Arnoux left Renault in and American Eddie Cheever replaced him as Prost&#x27;s partner, allegedly because of Renault&#x27;s desire to sell more road cars in North America (three of the season&#x27;s 15 races were on the North American continent). Prost earned a further four victories for Renault during the season and finished second in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, two points behind Nelson Piquet. Piquet and the Brabham team overhauled Prost and Renault in the last few races of the season. Prost, who felt the team had been too conservative in developing the car, found himself increasingly at odds with Renault&#x27;s management, who made him the scapegoat for failing to win a championship. In addition to that, the French fans recalled the bitter fight that had caused their favourite, Arnoux, to leave the team. Prost said in an interview with ESPN during the final race that his car was &quot;not competitive&quot; and that he &quot;didn&#x27;t lose by my own fault&quot; Renault fired Prost only two days after the South African race. He re-signed for McLaren for the 1984 season within days and moved his family home to Switzerland after Renault factory workers burned the second of 2 of Prost&#x27;s cars, one of them being a Mercedes-Benz.

===McLaren (1984–1989)===

====1984–1986====
Prost joined double world champion Niki Lauda at McLaren in , driving the John Barnard designed McLaren MP4/2 which used a 1.5 litre TAG-Porsche V6 engine. He lost the world championship to Lauda in the final race of the season in Portugal by half a point, despite winning seven races to Lauda&#x27;s five, including winning in Portugal. The half point came from the , where Prost had been leading, albeit with Ayrton Senna (Toleman) and Stefan Bellof (Tyrrell) closing on him rapidly, when Clerk of the Course Jacky Ickx stopped the race at half distance due to heavy rain, which was controversial, for Ickx displayed the red flag without consulting the race officials. Under Formula One regulations, Prost received only half of the nine points normally awarded for a victory. Prost&#x27;s seven wins in 1984 equalled the record set by Jim Clark in . Lauda&#x27;s 0.5-point margin of victory is the closest title race in Formula One history.

In Prost became the first French Formula One World Champion. He won five of the sixteen Grands Prix during the season. He had also won the San Marino Grand Prix, but was disqualified after his car was found to be 2 kg underweight in post-race scrutineering. Prost finished 20 points ahead of his closest rival, Michele Alboreto. Prost&#x27;s performance in 1985 earned him the Légion d&#x27;honneur distinction in France. At the end of the season, Lauda retired; he would later credit Prost with sending him into retirement, explaining that &quot;I had this perfect car, and then this French pain-in-the-ass arrives and blows me away. If he hadn&#x27;t turned up I&#x27;d have gone on for another few years.&quot;

Lauda was replaced at McLaren by World Champion Keke Rosberg for . Prost successfully defended his title, despite his car struggling against the Honda-powered Williams cars driven by Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell. Until the latter stages of the final race of the 1986 season, the , Prost appeared set to finish second in the Championship, behind Mansell. Prost had the same number of wins as Piquet, but he had four second places to Piquet&#x27;s three, thus placing him second before the final race. While running third behind Piquet, and directly behind Prost on the road (3rd was all he needed to win the title), Mansell suffered a rear tyre failure at and crashed out. The Williams team then pitted Piquet to change tyres as a safety precaution, while Prost had already pitted earlier due to a puncture and did not need to change his tyres again. He then held the lead ahead of a charging Piquet to the chequered flag and the championship. Prost became the first driver to retain the title since Jack Brabham in 1960.

Another memorable race that year for Prost was at the . He was cruising to victory when his car began to run out of fuel three corners from the chequered flag. Frantically weaving the car back and forth to slosh the last drops of fuel into the pickup, he managed to keep it running just long enough to creep over the line and win the race. Prost commented after the race that when his car started running dry he immediately thought to himself &quot;shit, I am going to lose this race again&quot;, referring to his 1985 disqualification at Imola. It happened again at the : while running in fourth position, Prost&#x27;s car ran out of fuel on the finishing straight of the last lap. Instead of retiring at a time in the season when points were critical, Prost got out of his car and tried to push it to the finish, to great applause from the crowd. The finish line was too far, though, and he never reached it. He was eventually classified sixth in the race, as the seventh-placed car (the Brabham-BMW of Derek Warwick) was a lap behind. Prost also finished sixth at the , where he collided with Gerhard Berger in the Benetton. As a result, the car&#x27;s front suspension and engine mountings were bent, which badly affected its handling. It would behave one way in left hand corners and a completely different way in right hand corners. McLaren Technical Director John Barnard said afterwards that the car was &quot;bent like a banana&quot; upon the teams&#x27; post-race inspection of the car.

====1987====
With Rosberg retiring from Formula One at the end of 1986 season, underrated Swede Stefan Johansson filled the McLaren seat alongside Prost for the season. Even though McLaren had introduced the new Steve Nichols designed MP4/3 after three seasons with the MP4/2 model (Barnard had departed for Ferrari), the TAG engines were not the force they had been previously, lagging behind in power and with unreliability previously unseen. He never gave up though and challenged Piquet and Mansell almost until the end, winning three races and breaking Jackie Stewart&#x27;s record for race victories by winning for the 28th time at the Portuguese Grand Prix. &quot;People might not believe me,&quot; said Stewart at the time. &quot;But I&#x27;m glad to see Alain take my record. I am glad that he has done it because he&#x27;s the one that deserves it. There is no doubt in my mind that he is the best race driver of his generation.&quot; Prost considers his win in the opening round in Brazil as his best and most rewarding race ever. The Williams-Hondas had been dominant during qualifying, and Prost started fifth on the grid with a time three seconds slower than Mansell&#x27;s pole time. Knowing he didn&#x27;t have the qualifying speed, he instead worked on his race set-up, and with everyone else going for a high-downforce set-up, he went the other way. The set-up meant less tyre wear, thanks to slower speeds in the corners while going fast down the straights. With his car having less tyre wear than his rivals, Prost was able to get through the 61 laps of the abrasive Jacarepaguá Circuit with only two stops compared to the three or more by his rivals (Piquet pitted for tyres 3 times within the first 40 laps). Prost finished 40 seconds in front of Piquet, with Johansson a further 16 seconds back in third.

When you win a race like this the feeling is very, very good. There have been times when I have been flat-out to finish sixth, but you can&#x27;t see that from the outside. In I finished three or four times in seventh place. I pushed like mad, yet everyone was gathered around the winner and they were thinking that I was just trundling around. But that&#x27;s motor racing. So in fact the only thing you can judge in this sport is the long term. You can judge a career or a season, but not one race.

Prost finished the 1987 season in fourth place in the championship behind Piquet, Mansell and Lotus driver Ayrton Senna. Prost finished 30 points behind champion Nelson Piquet. Other than his debut season in 1980 and , it was the furthest away he would finish a season from the championship lead.

Despite a slightly disappointing 1987 season, nevertheless by the end of that year Prost had the honour of notching up his 4th consecutive No.1 driver of the year by the editor of the &quot;Autocourse&quot; annual, matching Niki Lauda&#x27;s run of No.1&#x27;s from 1975 to 1978 in the same annual. Writing in 1987, the &quot;Autocourse&quot; editor mentioned that despite driving a down on power engine (compared to the Honda&#x27;s) &quot;Prost should have won at least 6 races in 1987 – but he won&#x27;t moan about it. Despite being out of championship contention, 1987 was a memorable year for Prost. His win at Estoril was exceptional.&quot; In 1985, the &quot;Autocourse&quot; editor wrote of Prost: &quot;In the long run, Ayrton Senna may be the better driver, but in 1985 for speed and consistency Prost had no equal&quot;, while in 1986, the &quot;Autocourse&quot; editor commented on Prost&#x27;s season &quot;Alain had an almost faultless year. 1986 was a year of Prost&#x27;s outstanding all round ability.&quot;

====1988====

The 1988 season proved to be a watershed moment for Formula One, as Honda ended its relationship with defending champion Williams and brought their all-conquering RA16 engines to Prost&#x27;s McLaren. Going into 1988, it was understood that any team that wanted Honda engines would have to sign one of the two Brazilian drivers favored by Honda (which coveted the South American car market): three-time world champion Nelson Piquet, or rising star Ayrton Senna. When McLaren asked Prost for his opinion, Prost suggested Senna, citing his youth and talent. It was a decision he would come to regret.

Upon signing Senna, McLaren announced that Prost and Senna would compete on equal terms. According to Dennis, &quot;Alain was fine with the competition, but deeply suspicious.&quot;

The McLaren-Honda partnership delivered Prost a legendarily fast car and two golden opportunities for a third Drivers&#x27; Championship, but it also kicked off one of Formula One&#x27;s most famous rivalries. McLaren-Honda dominated the season, winning 15 out of 16 races – a record that stood until the 2023 season, when Red Bull-Honda won 21 out of 22 races. McLaren scored three times as many points as second-placed Ferrari. Reflecting the dominance of Honda power, Williams finished a distant seventh in the Constructors&#x27; Championship just one year after winning the title by 61 points.

Prost finished first or second in every race other than his two retirements at Silverstone and Monza. He won seven races and outscored his new teammate Senna by 11 points, despite Senna winning one more race than him. Although Prost would have been champion under the 1991 scoring system, Senna took the title by three points under the rules of the day – only the 11 best results from the season counted toward a driver&#x27;s championship total, a rule that in practice valued Senna&#x27;s wins over Prost&#x27;s consistent podiums. Senna nearly shunted an overtaking Prost into the pit wall at Estoril, but other than that, the two competitors generally raced cleanly on track that year.

Over the course of the 1988 season, Prost began to suspect that Honda was trying to make Senna McLaren&#x27;s number one driver, in violation of McLaren&#x27;s promise to treat the two drivers equally. He met with Honda F1 boss Nobuhiko Kawamoto at the end of the season to express these concerns. Kawamoto acknowledged that Honda&#x27;s engineers were probably more excited to work with Senna than Prost, but said that he intended to deliver Prost equal machinery on race day. However, following the 1988 season, Kawamoto was promoted to a position at Honda headquarters.

====1989====
McLaren&#x27;s domination continued throughout , and with no meaningful outside competition, Prost and Senna&#x27;s title fight turned inwards. Prost accused Senna of dangerous driving and dishonorable behavior. After Imola, the two drivers were no longer on speaking terms.

Prost also accused Senna of receiving unwarranted favoritism from McLaren-Honda. His suspicions were inflamed when Honda sent McLaren an engine crate marked &quot;Special - For Ayrton.&quot; After Prost (who was in the last year of his contract with McLaren) threatened to join a rival team at the end of the season, Ron Dennis publicly backed Prost against Honda, &quot;declar[ing] that the team had found consistent differences&quot; between the engines that Honda assigned to Senna and Prost. To accommodate Prost&#x27;s concerns, Dennis attempted to allocate engines on a random basis, such as a coin flip or drawing numbers from a hat. 

Matters came to a head at the Italian Grand Prix, where Prost burned his bridges with both McLaren and Honda. In advance of the Italian Grand Prix, he announced that he would drive for Ferrari in 1990. Following his announcement, McLaren provided full support to Senna&#x27;s title chase. Although Prost was the championship leader and would have been the natural candidate for priority, at Monza McLaren gave Prost one car and four or five mechanics, while Senna received two cars and 20 assistants. In addition, while the new Honda F1 leadership publicly stated that Prost was getting the same equipment as Senna, Prost publicly rejected Honda&#x27;s reassurances. After Senna outqualified Prost by a mammoth +1.790 seconds, Prost once again complained about Honda to the press. Insulted, Honda threatened to withdraw its engines from Prost&#x27;s car unless Prost apologized, which he did. Ultimately, Prost won at Monza while Senna retired with an engine issue, giving Prost a commanding 20-point lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Prost threw salt in the wound by dropping his winner&#x27;s trophy into the crowd of cheering Ferrari fans, a major taboo at McLaren. 

Following the tumult of the weekend, Senna opportunistically encouraged McLaren to fire Prost immediately, and Ferrari offered to accommodate the move by switching Prost with Ferrari&#x27;s Gerhard Berger for the final four weeks of the season. Cooler heads prevailed, and McLaren allowed Prost to finish the season with the team in exchange for a public, written apology. This concession eliminated the possibility that Prost would clinch the 1989 title in a Ferrari car.

Prost clinched his third Drivers&#x27; Championship at the Japanese Grand Prix, the penultimate race of the season. Prost was 16 points ahead of Senna at the time, meaning that Senna needed to win the last two races. By contrast, Prost would automatically become the champion if Senna retired from either race, which was precisely what happened. Prost and Senna collided with seven laps to go, and Prost was widely blamed for causing the collision. (Prost was leading the race at the time and refused to leave a gap on the inside. Senna&#x27;s normal practice was to line up his car for a crash and dare the other driver to back off, and as expected, Senna refused to yield and collided with Prost&#x27;s car.) Senna managed to restart his car and win the race, but the FIA (led by Prost&#x27;s countryman Jean-Marie Balestre, whom Senna disliked) disqualified him for missing the chicane, fined him US$100,000 for &quot;dangerous driving,&quot; and handed him a suspended six-month ban.

Following the race, Prost admitted that &quot;I know everybody thinks I did it on purpose,&quot; but rationalized that &quot;Senna came behind me, I didn&#x27;t see him come and I couldn&#x27;t do anything to avoid him. I am very sorry to have to finish[ed] the championship on such an incident.&quot; He later said that he knew Senna would attempt to pass him at the chicane, and while &quot;I did not [crash] on purpose, I did not open the door.&quot; McLaren, now fully behind Senna, unsuccessfully appealed the disqualification, which &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; characterized as Ron Dennis &quot;objecting to his [own] driver&#x27;s winning the world title.&quot;

===Ferrari (1990–1991)===

In 1990, Prost became the first Ferrari driver to sign for the Scuderia after the death of team founder Enzo Ferrari in 1988. Ferrari had lured away several McLaren chassis designers over the years, including John Barnard and Steve Nichols. The 1990 Ferrari 641 was the first car to seriously threaten Honda&#x27;s stranglehold on the Constructors&#x27; Championship, as Ferrari came within 11 points of the title. Prost won five races for Ferrari that year, in Brazil, Mexico, France, Britain and Spain. At Mexico, he accomplished one of his finest drives, winning the race after starting in 13th position. In both the Mexican and Spanish races, he led Mansell to Ferrari 1–2 finishes.

The championship once again came to the penultimate round of the season in Japan, but this time the roles were reversed, with Prost trailing McLaren-Honda&#x27;s Senna by nine points. As in 1989, a controversial collision between the two settled the race. At the first corner of the first lap, Senna intentionally drove his car into Prost&#x27;s, taking them both out of the race and sealing the title in his favour. Dennis immediately knew that Senna had purposely crashed Prost out of the race, but it took a year for Senna to admit that the crash was intentional; in 1991, he disclosed that he crashed into Prost in part to retaliate for Prost&#x27;s actions in 1989. Although Prost complained loudly about Senna&#x27;s manoeuvre, saying that &quot;What he did today was absolutely disgusting. ... He has no value [as a person],&quot; Senna was not penalized. Prost finished the season seven points behind Senna, and his Ferrari team were runners-up to McLaren in the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

At the end of the season, Mansell left the Scuderia to rejoin a resurgent Williams team, citing his unstable relationship with Prost. Although Mansell had supported Prost during the 1989 Prost-Honda controversy, as reigning world champion, Prost had joined Ferrari as the team&#x27;s lead driver and was said to have played on this status. (According to Mansell, Ferrari contractually guaranteed him number one driver status, but once Prost became available, Ferrari paid Mansell to let Prost be the number one driver.) Mansell said that after watching him take pole in France with a purportedly superior chassis, Prost secretly demanded that Ferrari give him Mansell&#x27;s car for the next race in Britain. Mansell was replaced by Frenchman Jean Alesi.
The season was not as kind to Ferrari, as the Ferrari 642 was not as reliable as the McLaren and Williams cars. Prost never finished a race lower than fifth, but won no races, scored only five podiums, and finished only eight races; similarly, Alesi finished only seven races. Reportedly, Ferrari&#x27;s famous V12 engine was no longer competitive against the smaller, lighter and more fuel efficient V10s of its competitors, and the Ferrari chassis was likewise uncompetitive. (Barnard had left Ferrari in 1990, early enough to have input on the 1990 car but too late to help with the 1991 cars.) Although Ferrari upgraded the car to the Ferrari 643 in time for Prost&#x27;s home race at Magny-Cours, in which Prost and Alesi finished second and fourth, the car was still unable to compete for the title over the course of the season. Adding insult to injury, Mansell&#x27;s Williams-Renault clearly supplanted Ferrari as McLaren-Honda&#x27;s main competition in 1991, and Mansell finished second in the Drivers&#x27; Championship that year.

Prost took out his frustrations on the team, publicly likening the car to a &quot;truck.&quot; Ferrari retaliated by firing him with one race left to go in the 1991 season. He was replaced by Italian driver Gianni Morbidelli for the 1991 Australian Grand Prix and by another Italian, Ivan Capelli, for the following season.

===Williams (1993)===
Prost spent the 1992 season on sabbatical. Ligier offered him a seat, and he eventually performed pre-season testing for the team in early 1992, but Ferrari paid him a significant amount of money to take the year off. During this season, Nigel Mansell put up record numbers in the Williams-Renault and won the title with five races remaining. The McLaren-Honda combination was waning: due to economic difficulties in Japan, Honda was not in position to outspend Renault on engine development. Honda opted to leave Formula One at season&#x27;s end rather than carry on with a second-tier product. With no meaningful competition, a Williams driver was expected to cruise to the title again in 1993.

Prost quickly recognized the potential of the Williams car and began negotiating with Frank Williams for a 1993 ride no later than the second race of the 1992 season. He ultimately signed a two-year contract for 1993 and 1994. Prost had expected to race alongside Mansell, but Mansell&#x27;s contract negotiations fell through over financial terms. As insurance, Prost had negotiated a clause in his contract which prevented Senna from joining the team. Although Senna furiously accused Prost of cowardice, there was nothing he could do about it.
Prost won his fourth and final title in 1993. That year, Williams-Renault fielded another dominant car and handily defended the Constructors&#x27; Championship, finishing with twice as many points as second-placed McLaren. Prost led the way, winning seven of the first ten races and taking pole in thirteen out of sixteen races. Although he was regularly challenged on track by teammate Hill and rival Senna, he finished 26 points ahead of the second-placed Senna and clinched the title in Portugal with two races to go. At season&#x27;s end, the British government awarded Prost an OBE for his performances; he had won all four of his titles with British teams.

Shortly before securing the title, Prost announced he would retire at the end of the season. At the time, he stated that under the terms of his Williams contract, while he could block Senna from joining Williams in 1993, he could not do so for 1994. However, in an interview for Asif Kapadia&#x27;s 2010 documentary &quot;Senna&quot;, Prost revealed that the Senna clause did in fact extend to 1994, but Renault (Williams&#x27; engine supplier) pressured Frank Williams to ask Prost to waive the clause. As a compromise, the 38-year-old Prost agreed to retire after the 1993 season, provided that Williams paid him his agreed-upon salary for the 1994 season. This cleared the way for Senna to join Williams in 1994.

Prost finished on the podium in his final race (Adelaide 1993). Following the race, Senna embraced him, which Prost found surprising, as Senna had declined a handshake at the previous race. McLaren tempted Prost to unretire by offering him Senna&#x27;s old seat for the 1994 season, but while Senna encouraged Prost to take the offer, Prost was unimpressed by a test-drive of the 1994 car and retired for good.

===Helmet===
Prost used a helmet design based on the three colours of the French flag, blue, white and red, with his name along the side. During his early career Prost used a basic design of white all over with some blue detail around the visor (blue helmet with a white 180° flipped Y and red lines in the lower branch of the flipped Y and in the upper branch, surrounding the top). During Prost&#x27;s time at Renault, he used more blue details, most notably around the rear of his helmet. Prost&#x27;s helmet changed in 1985, as his helmet now had the blue detail around the front, surrounding the visor (with also a blue stripe on the side region, making the white area become a P) and a white ring with red lines surrounding the top (forming a white circle with a blue half in the rear of the top). Prost kept a similar design for his entry at Ferrari and Williams. Sometimes Prost used variants of his helmet design. In 2007 he used his original design, but with the circle top all red and a red line in the lower chin area. In 2010, he used a pearl white helmet with silver flames and a blue-white-red-white-blue stripe on the visor, designed by Kaos Design.

==Career legacy==
Prost is widely regarded as one of Formula One&#x27;s greatest-ever drivers. He has the fourth-most Drivers&#x27; Championships of all time, behind only Lewis Hamilton, Michael Schumacher, and Juan Manuel Fangio. In addition, he was just 12.5 points away from an eight-title career. At his retirement, Prost held the record for most career Grand Prix victories (51), which stood for fourteen years. (Michael Schumacher broke Prost&#x27;s record during the 2001 season. For his own part, Prost believed that had Ayrton Senna not died in 1994, he would have broken Prost&#x27;s wins record first.) In addition, while Senna held the record for most career pole positions at Prost&#x27;s retirement, Prost was superb on race day and held the record for most career fastest laps (41) until 2001, when Schumacher broke that record as well.

Prost currently shares the record for the highest percentage of races started from the front row in a single season (16 for 16 in ) with Ayrton Senna () and Damon Hill (). , he is the last Frenchman to have won his home Grand Prix.

=== Driving style ===
During his career, Prost was nicknamed &quot;The Professor&quot; for his intellectual approach to competition. Though it was not a name he particularly cared for, he later admitted that the term appropriately characterized his driving style. Skilled at setting up his car for race conditions, Prost would often conserve his brakes and tyres early in a race, leaving them fresher for a challenge at the end. His mantra was to &quot;win as slowly as possible,&quot; a phrase he may have picked up from his teammate Niki Lauda, or Juan Manuel Fangio. Honda F1 boss Nobuhiko Kawamoto once told Prost that Ayrton Senna &quot;was more the samurai, and [Prost] was more the computer.&quot;

In contrast to Senna, who had a &quot;tendency to go flat out all the time,&quot; Prost employed a smooth, relaxed style behind the wheel, deliberately modelling himself on personal heroes like Jackie Stewart and Jim Clark. Although Prost may not have driven as stylishly as his contemporaries – Nigel Mansell once said that Prost merely &quot;chauffeur[ed]&quot; the best car on the grid – Stewart praised Prost for his silkiness behind the wheel, explaining, &quot;To some, that&#x27;s boring; to me, it&#x27;s artistry - and so much more difficult than just throwing a car about.&quot; Prost&#x27;s calmness allowed him to get the most out of an engine without driving it to failure. Clive James wrote that Prost &quot;was considered uncanny even by the other drivers for the way his cars held together: it was as if he could hear what was going on in the engine. Prost was the car&#x27;s friend. Other drivers treated the car no more tactfully than they treated women.&quot; However, his approach had some critics, including Ron Dennis, who was upset that Prost declined to go for the win at Spa in 1985. Prost responded that &quot;I&#x27;ve lost the championship at the last moment so many times I&#x27;m not taking any chances.&quot;

Prost&#x27;s smooth style sometimes masked his raw pace on track. Steve Nichols, Prost&#x27;s car designer at McLaren and Ferrari, said that at the 1985 Belgian Grand Prix, he watched Prost calmly circle the track three times, and did not realize that Prost had taken pole position until after he went back to the garage. Nigel Roebuck told a similar story about a Prost pole position at Monaco. Adrian Newey, Prost&#x27;s car designer at Williams, said that Prost sometimes frustrated him in testing because Prost rarely pushed the car to the limit, making it harder for Newey to figure out whether the car was quick enough. Newey added that &quot;when he wanted to, he could turn it on.&quot; Although Senna crushed Prost in qualifying during their 32 races together, taking 26 poles to Prost&#x27;s 4, on race day Prost scored 12 fastest laps to Senna&#x27;s 6.

Although Senna outshone Prost&#x27;s qualifying pace, Prost was also an underrated qualifier. Niki Lauda remarked that when Prost joined McLaren in 1984, Prost was so quick that Lauda quit trying to match Prost in qualifying and used his track time to set up his car for the race. Prost internalized those lessons and used them against Senna in 1988 and 1989.

Prost also understood the importance of racing in top machinery; McLaren&#x27;s website comments that he &quot;built his long career on making the right move at the right time.&quot; However, once he found his way into a winning team, he was not always deft with his relationships with teams and engine suppliers. Formula One&#x27;s website notes that while Prost &quot;made winning races [] look easy,&quot; he &quot;was less successful at the politics in which he was invariably embroiled,&quot; and he &quot;left teams acrimoniously on four occasions.&quot;

=== Appraisals by contemporaries ===
In 2009, an &quot;Autosport&quot; survey taken by 217 Formula One drivers saw Prost voted as the fourth greatest Formula One driver of all time, behind Senna, Schumacher, and Fangio. Prost&#x27;s teammate Keke Rosberg said that &quot;He&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever known, no question about it. As an all-round race driver he&#x27;s head and shoulders clear of anyone else.&quot; Formula One CEO Bernie Ecclestone traditionally said that Prost was the greatest driver of all time, as Prost, unlike Senna or Schumacher, rarely enjoyed number one driver treatment. In 2023, Ecclestone said that Max Verstappen had surpassed Prost. Jordan team boss Eddie Jordan shared Ecclestone&#x27;s opinion, appreciating that Prost &quot;never minded who his teammate was&quot; (Senna being a notable exception). Formula One medical chief Sid Watkins said that Prost and Niki Lauda were the most intelligent drivers he had worked with, noting that he could recall only one dangerous auto accident involving Prost in his career.

=== Quantitative ratings ===
Various outlets have attempted to develop models that objectively measure driver skill relative to car quality. Prost generally places highly in these comparisons.

===Rivalry with Ayrton Senna===

Prost&#x27;s battles with Ayrton Senna were widely covered. The two drivers were intense competitors and contributed to several infamous on-track incidents:

* Estoril 1988 (Senna tried to stop Prost from passing him by threatening to sideswipe him into the pit wall)
* Imola 1989 (Senna and Prost agreed to avoid racing each other too closely on the first lap, but disagreed on the precise terms of the agreement, after which Prost complained to the media)
* Suzuka 1989 (driving side by side with Senna, Prost clinched the Drivers&#x27; Championship by turning into Senna&#x27;s path on the inside line and daring him to brake or crash)
* Suzuka 1990 (driving side by side with Prost, Senna clinched the Drivers&#x27; Championship by intentionally crashing Prost out of the race in retaliation for the 1989 incident)
* Hockenheim 1991 (Senna ran Prost off the track and onto the escape road).

Following the 1991 Hockenheim incident, the FISA ordered a sit-down meeting between the two men to cool tensions and prevent further incidents.

In addition, the two drivers both found themselves chasing the same race seat after the 1992 season, as Ferrari&#x27;s performance had declined and Honda left Formula One, leaving Williams-Renault as the unquestioned ruler of Formula One. In exchange for his signature with Williams, Prost infamously blocked the team from signing Senna, prompting Senna to publicly complain that Prost was &quot;behaving like a coward.&quot; Senna&#x27;s Brazilian fans were so enraged by Prost&#x27;s refusal to race with Senna on equal terms that Prost received a police escort for the 1993 Brazilian Grand Prix. Prost comfortably won the 1993 title and retired at season&#x27;s end, allowing Senna to take the lead at Williams in 1994.

Once they were no longer competitors, the two rivals began mending their relationship. At Prost&#x27;s last Grand Prix, the 1993 Australian Grand Prix, Senna pulled him onto the top step of the podium for an embrace. Only a couple of days before Senna&#x27;s untimely death at Imola, when filming an in-car lap of Imola for French television channel TF1, he greeted Prost, by then a pundit on the channel: &quot;A special hello to my...to our dear friend, Alain. We all miss you Alain.&quot; Prost said that he was amazed and very touched by the comment. Prost was a pallbearer at Senna&#x27;s funeral, and commented that when Senna died &quot;a part of himself had died also&quot;, because their careers had been so closely bound together. Senna felt similarly, admitting to a close friend that after Prost retired, he realised how much of his motivation had come from fighting with Prost.

==Later life==
During 1994 and 1995, Prost worked as a pundit for the French TV channel TF1. He also worked for Renault doing public relations and promotions. Prost went back to his old team McLaren, working as a technical adviser; he also completed L&#x27;Étape du Tour, an annual mass-participation bike ride that takes place on a stage of the Tour de France. 

===Prost Grand Prix===
During 1989 Prost began to contemplate starting his own team, as his relationship with his McLaren teammate, Ayrton Senna, had turned sour. Prost and John Barnard, formerly chief designer at McLaren, came close to founding a team in 1990; but a lack of sponsorship meant that this was not possible, so Prost moved to Ferrari and Barnard left Ferrari to join Benetton. After falling out with the Italian team at the end of 1991, Prost found himself without a drive for 1992; after the failure of extensive negotiations with Guy Ligier about buying his Ligier team, Prost decided to join Williams for 1993. By 1995, when Prost was working for Renault, people had assumed that a Prost-Renault team would be formed. Renault refused Prost&#x27;s request to supply engines for his team, ending the speculation.

On 13 February 1997, Prost bought the Ligier team from Flavio Briatore and renamed it &quot;Prost Grand Prix&quot;. The day after he bought the team, Prost signed a three-year deal with French car manufacturer Peugeot, who would supply the team with engines from until . For the team&#x27;s first season, Prost kept one of Ligier&#x27;s 1996 drivers, Olivier Panis, who had won the Monaco Grand Prix the previous year; Japanese driver Shinji Nakano was signed to partner Panis. The team raced with the Mugen-Honda engines used by Ligier the previous season, while the car was actually the originally intended Ligier JS45, but was renamed the Prost JS45. Things looked promising at the start of the season, as the team picked up two points on its Grand Prix debut in Australia when Olivier Panis finished fifth. The team scored a further 13 points before Panis broke his leg in an accident during the Canadian Grand Prix. He was replaced by Minardi&#x27;s Jarno Trulli. From there, things started to go downhill slightly, the team scored only five points during Panis&#x27;s recovery. He came back at the end of the season to race in the last three Grands Prix. Prost GP finished sixth in the Constructors&#x27; Championship in its first season, with 21 points.

Prost became the president of Prost Grand Prix at the start of 1998. With Peugeot supplying the engines for Prost GP, Mugen-Honda decided to supply the Jordan team. Prost GP scored a single point during the season when Jarno Trulli finished sixth in Belgium.

 was a crucial year for Prost GP. Prost hired John Barnard as a technical consultant, Barnard&#x27;s B3 Technologies company helping Loic Bigois with the design of the Prost AP02. Panis and Trulli agreed to stay on with the team for the season. The car was not a major concern but the Peugeot V10 engine proved to be heavy and unreliable.

Peugeot&#x27;s final year as Prost&#x27;s engine supplier in 2000 saw some optimism. Prost hired his 1991 Ferrari teammate Jean Alesi to drive the lead car and German Nick Heidfeld, who had won the 1999 Formula 3000 championship, to partner him. The season proved to be yet another disastrous one: the AP03 proved to be unreliable and ill handling. Things weren&#x27;t helped when the drivers collided with each other in the Austrian Grand Prix. Newly hired technical director Alan Jenkins was fired midway through the year. Prost restructured the team, hiring Joan Villadelprat as the managing director and replacing Jenkins with Henri Durand as the team&#x27;s new technical director.

In Ferrari agreed to supply engines for the season. The money ran out at the start of the season and Prost was out of business, leaving debts of around $30 million.

===Other roles===
During 2002, Prost spent time with his family and competed in eight bicycle races, finishing third in the &quot;Granite – Mont Lozère&quot;. The Frenchman raced in the Andros ice race series in 2003, finishing second in the championship behind Yvan Muller. In 2003 and 2004, Prost took part in the Étape du Tour. Prost also became an Ambassador for Uniroyal, a position he would keep until May 2006. Prost continued to compete in the Andros Trophy, winning the title with Toyota in 2006/07, 2007/08 and with Dacia in 2011/2012.

For the 2010 Formula One season, the Sporting Regulations were changed so that a former driver sits on the stewards&#x27; panel. Prost was the first such driver to take on this role, at the 2010 Bahrain Grand Prix. Prost also took part in the Race of Champions in 2010, a race organised for legends of motor sport to compete in equal machinery. In February 2012, Prost was named as Renault&#x27;s new international ambassador, representing the company in sports demonstrations and at events organized or attended by Renault. Prost has finished the Absa Cape Epic, an eight-day 700 km mountain bike race in South Africa, twice. He first completed the race in 2012 with partner Sebastien di Pasqua and then again in 2013, and started but did not finish the race in 2014.

In October 2013, it was announced that Prost would join forces with Jean-Paul Driot&#x27;s DAMS racing team to form e.dams, a team which would compete in the FIA Formula E Championship for electric racing cars from its commencement in September 2014. In June 2014, the team announced that its initial driver line-up would consist of Nicolas Prost and Sébastien Buemi. The team went on to win the inaugural Formula E teams championship. Prost was a pundit with Channel 4 F1 for the season.

In 2017, he was employed as a special adviser for the Renault Formula One Team. Since July 2019, he took up a non-executive director role with Renault Sport. During the 1000th Formula One race, the 2019 Chinese Grand Prix, Prost had the honor of waving the chequered flag as Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton crossed the line to take his 75th career victory. Prost continued in his role within Renault Formula One Team, renamed &quot;Alpine F1 Team&quot; in 2021, until January 2022, when his departure from the team was announced.

===Personal life===
Prost was married to Anne-Marie (born 14 February 1955), but they divorced sometime later. They have two sons, Nicolas (born 18 August 1981) and Sacha Prost (born 30 May 1990). Prost also has a daughter, Victoria, born in 1996 from his relationship with Bernadette Cottin. From 2014 to 2018, Nicolas raced in Formula E for e.dams Renault, a team partially run by his father. Prost lived in his hometown, Saint-Chamond, until he and his Renault team fell out in the early 1980s. In April 1983 the Prost family moved to Sainte-Croix, Switzerland, and shortly after to Yens, Switzerland. They moved to Switzerland after Renault workers went to Prost&#x27;s house in France and burned his Mercedes-Benz and another one of his road cars. They lived there until November 1999, when they moved to Nyon in the same country. Through Nicolas, Prost has two grandsons named Kimi (born November 2015) and Mika (born December 2020). Through Sacha, he has another grandson named Liam (born June 2018).

In 1986, Prost was awarded the Légion d&#x27;honneur by the French President, François Mitterrand; he was promoted from Chevalier to Officier rank in 1993. In addition, he was awarded an honorary British OBE in 1994, and the Brazilian Order of the Southern Cross in 1999. He was also inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame and the FIA Hall of Fame in 1999 and 2017 respectively.

Besides his native French language, Prost also speaks fluent English and Italian.

== In popular culture ==
Prost voiced an animated depiction of himself in McLaren&#x27;s &quot;Tooned&quot; cartoon series to commemorate McLaren&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Episode 5 of the series&#x27; second season tells a fictionalized account of the 1984 Formula One season which attributes Prost&#x27;s mechanical failures and final championship standing in the season to the actions of the character Professor M (voiced by Alexander Armstrong).

<text>The Quran, also romanized Qur&#x27;an or Koran, is the central religious text of Islam, believed by Muslims to be a revelation directly from God (&quot;Allāh&quot;). It is organized in 114 chapters () which consist of individual verses (&quot;&quot;). Besides its religious significance, it is widely regarded as the finest work in Arabic literature, and has significantly influenced the Arabic language. It is the object of a modern field of academic research known as Quranic studies.

Muslims believe the Quran was orally revealed by God to the final Islamic prophet Muhammad through the angel Gabriel incrementally over a period of some 23 years, beginning on the Laylat al-Qadr, when Muhammad was 40, and concluding in 632, the year of his death. Muslims regard the Quran as Muhammad&#x27;s most important miracle, a proof of his prophethood, and the culmination of a series of divine messages starting with those revealed to the first Islamic prophet Adam, including the holy books of the Torah, Psalms, and Gospel in Islam.

The Quran is believed by Muslims to be God&#x27;s own divine speech providing a complete code of conduct across all facets of life. This has led Muslim theologians to fiercely debate whether the Quran was &quot;created or uncreated.&quot; According to tradition, several of Muhammad&#x27;s companions served as scribes, recording the revelations. Shortly after Muhammad&#x27;s death, the Quran was compiled on the order of the first caliph Abu Bakr () by the companions, who had written down or memorized parts of it. Caliph Uthman () established a standard version, now known as the Uthmanic codex, which is generally considered the archetype of the Quran known today. There are, however, variant readings, with some differences in meaning.

The Quran assumes the reader&#x27;s familiarity with major narratives recounted in the Biblical and apocryphal texts. It summarizes some, dwells at length on others and, in some cases, presents alternative accounts and interpretations of events. The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance for humankind (). It sometimes offers detailed accounts of specific historical events, and it often emphasizes the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence.

Supplementing the Quran with explanations for some cryptic Quranic narratives, and rulings that also provide the basis for Islamic law in most denominations of Islam, are hadiths—oral and written traditions believed to describe words and actions of Muhammad. During prayers, the Quran is recited only in Arabic. Someone who has memorized the entire Quran is called a . Ideally, verses are recited with a special kind of prosody reserved for this purpose called . During the month of Ramadan, Muslims typically complete the recitation of the whole Quran during prayers. In order to extrapolate the meaning of a particular Quranic verse, Muslims rely on exegesis, or commentary rather than a direct translation of the text.
== Etymology and meaning ==
The word appears about 70 times in the Quran itself, assuming various meanings. It is a verbal noun () of the Arabic verb () meaning &#x27;he read&#x27; or &#x27;he recited&#x27;. The Syriac equivalent is (), which refers to &#x27;scripture reading&#x27; or &#x27;lesson&#x27;. While some Western scholars consider the word to be derived from the Syriac, the majority of Muslim authorities hold the origin of the word is itself. Regardless, it had become an Arabic term by Muhammad&#x27;s lifetime. An important meaning of the word is the &#x27;act of reciting&#x27;, as reflected in an early Quranic passage: &quot;It is for Us to collect it and to recite it ().&quot;

In other verses, the word refers to &#x27;an individual passage recited [by Muhammad]&#x27;. Its liturgical context is seen in a number of passages, for example: &quot;So when is recited, listen to it and keep silent.&quot; The word may also assume the meaning of a codified scripture when mentioned with other scriptures such as the Torah and Gospel.

The term also has closely related synonyms that are employed throughout the Quran. Each synonym possesses its own distinct meaning, but its use may converge with that of in certain contexts. Such terms include (&#x27;book&#x27;), (&#x27;sign&#x27;), and (&#x27;scripture&#x27;); the latter two terms also denote units of revelation. In the large majority of contexts, usually with a definite article (), the word is referred to as the (&#x27;revelation&#x27;), that which has been &quot;sent down&quot; () at intervals. Other related words include: (&#x27;remembrance&#x27;), used to refer to the Quran in the sense of a reminder and warning; and (&#x27;wisdom&#x27;), sometimes referring to the revelation or part of it.

The Quran describes itself as &#x27;the discernment&#x27; (), &#x27;the mother book&#x27; (), &#x27;the guide&#x27; (), &#x27;the wisdom&#x27; (), &#x27;the remembrance&#x27; (), and &#x27;the revelation&#x27; (; &#x27;something sent down&#x27;, signifying the descent of an object from a higher place to lower place). Another term is (&#x27;The Book&#x27;), though it is also used in the Arabic language for other scriptures, such as the Torah and the Gospels. The term (&#x27;written work&#x27;) is often used to refer to particular Quranic manuscripts but is also used in the Quran to identify earlier revealed books.

== History ==
=== Prophetic era ===
Islamic tradition relates that Muhammad received his first revelation in 610 CE in the Cave of Hira on the Night of Power during one of his isolated retreats to the mountains. Thereafter, he received revelations over a period of 23 years. According to (traditions ascribed to Muhammad) and Muslim history, after Muhammad and his followers immigrated to Medina and formed an independent Muslim community, he ordered many of his companions to recite the Quran and to learn and teach the laws, which were revealed daily. It is related that some of the Quraysh who were taken prisoners at the Battle of Badr regained their freedom after they had taught some of the Muslims the simple writing of the time. Thus a group of Muslims gradually became literate. As it was initially spoken, the Quran was recorded on tablets, bones, and the wide, flat ends of date palm fronds. Most suras (also usually transliterated as Surah) were in use amongst early Muslims since they are mentioned in numerous sayings by both Sunni and Shia sources, relating Muhammad&#x27;s use of the Quran as a call to Islam, the making of prayer and the manner of recitation. However, the Quran did not exist in book form at the time of Muhammad&#x27;s death in 632 at age 61–62. There is agreement among scholars that Muhammad himself did not write down the revelation.
 narrates Muhammad describing the revelations as, &quot;Sometimes it is (revealed) like the ringing of a bell&quot; and A&#x27;isha reported, &quot;I saw the Prophet being inspired Divinely on a very cold day and noticed the sweat dropping from his forehead (as the Inspiration was over).&quot; Muhammad&#x27;s first revelation, according to the Quran, was accompanied with a vision. The agent of revelation is mentioned as the &quot;one mighty in power,&quot; the one who &quot;grew clear to view when he was on the uppermost horizon. Then he drew nigh and came down till he was (distant) two bows&#x27; length or even nearer.&quot; The Islamic studies scholar Welch states in the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Islam&quot; that he believes the graphic descriptions of Muhammad&#x27;s condition at these moments may be regarded as genuine, because he was severely disturbed after these revelations. According to Welch, these seizures would have been seen by those around him as convincing evidence for the superhuman origin of Muhammad&#x27;s inspirations. However, Muhammad&#x27;s critics accused him of being a possessed man, a soothsayer, or a magician since his experiences were similar to those claimed by such figures well known in ancient Arabia. Welch additionally states that it remains uncertain whether these experiences occurred before or after Muhammad&#x27;s initial claim of prophethood.

The Quran describes Muhammad as &quot;&quot;, which is traditionally interpreted as &#x27;illiterate&#x27;, but the meaning is rather more complex. Medieval commentators such as al-Tabari () maintained that the term induced two meanings: first, the inability to read or write in general; second, the inexperience or ignorance of the previous books or scriptures (but they gave priority to the first meaning). Muhammad&#x27;s illiteracy was taken as a sign of the genuineness of his prophethood. For example, according to Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, if Muhammad had mastered writing and reading he possibly would have been suspected of having studied the books of the ancestors. Some scholars such as W. Montgomery Watt prefer the second meaning of —they take it to indicate unfamiliarity with earlier sacred texts.

The final verse of the Quran was revealed on the 18th of the Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah in the year 10 A.H., a date that roughly corresponds to February or March 632. The verse was revealed after the Prophet finished delivering his sermon at Ghadir Khumm.

According to Islamic tradition, the Quran was revealed to Muhammad in seven different (meaning letters; however, it could mean dialects, forms, styles or modes). Most Islamic scholars agree that these different are the same Quran revealed in seven different Arabic dialects and that they do not change the meaning of the Quran, the purpose of which was to make the Quran easy for recitation and memorization among the different Arab tribes. While Sunni Muslims believe in the seven , some Shia reject the idea of seven Quranic variants. A common misconception is that the seven and the are the same.

=== Compilation and preservation ===

Following Muhammad&#x27;s death in 632, a number of his companions who memorized the Quran were killed in the Battle of al-Yamama by Musaylima. The first caliph, Abu Bakr (), subsequently decided to collect the book in one volume so that it could be preserved. Zayd ibn Thabit () was the person to collect the Quran since &quot;he used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah&#x27;s Apostle&quot;. Thus, a group of scribes, most importantly Zayd, collected the verses and produced a hand-written manuscript of the complete book. The manuscript according to Zayd remained with Abu Bakr until he died. Zayd&#x27;s reaction to the task and the difficulties in collecting the Quranic material from parchments, palm-leaf stalks, thin stones (collectively known as , any written work containing divine teachings) and from men who knew it by heart is recorded in earlier narratives. In 644, Muhammad&#x27;s widow Hafsa bint Umar was entrusted with the manuscript until the third caliph, Uthman (), requested the standard copy from her. According to historian Michael Cook, early Muslim narratives about the collection and compilation of the Quran sometimes contradict themselves: &quot;Most ... make Uthman little more than an editor, but there are some in which he appears very much a collector, appealing to people to bring him any bit of the Quran they happen to possess.&quot; Some accounts also &quot;suggest that in fact the material&quot; Abu Bakr worked with &quot;had already been assembled&quot;, which since he was the first caliph, would mean they were collected when Muhammad was still alive.

Around the 650s, the Islamic expansion beyond the Arabian Peninsula and into Persia, the Levant and North Africa, as well as the use of the seven , had caused some confusion and differences in the pronunciation of the Qur&#x27;an, and conflict was arising between different Arab tribes due to some claiming to be more superior to other Arab tribes and non-Arabs based on dialect, which Uthman noticed. In order to preserve the sanctity of the text, he ordered a committee headed by Zayd to use Abu Bakr&#x27;s copy and prepare a standard text of the Quran. Thus, within 20 years of Muhammad&#x27;s death in 632, the complete Quran was committed to written form as the Uthmanic codex. That text became the model from which copies were made and promulgated throughout the urban centers of the Muslim world, and other versions are believed to have been destroyed. and the six other of the Qur&#x27;an fell out of use. The present form of the Quran text is accepted by Muslim scholars to be the original version compiled by Abu Bakr.

Qira&#x27;at which is a way and method of reciting the Qur&#x27;an was developed sometime afterwards. There are ten canonical recitations and they are not to be confused with ahruf. Shias recite the Quran according to the of Hafs on authority of ‘Asim, which is the prevalent in the Islamic world and believe that the Quran was gathered and compiled by Muhammad during his lifetime. It is claimed that the Shia had more than 1,000 hadiths ascribed to the Shia Imams which indicate the distortion of the Quran and according to Etan Kohlberg, this belief about Quran was common among Shiites in the early centuries of Islam. In his view, Ibn Babawayh was the first major Twelver author &quot;to adopt a position identical to that of the Sunnis&quot; and the change was a result of the &quot;rise to power of the Sunni &#x27;Abbasid caliphate,&quot; whence belief in the corruption of the Quran became untenable vis-a-vis the position of Sunni &quot;orthodoxy&quot;. Alleged distortions have been carried out to remove any references to the rights of Ali, the Imams and their supporters and the disapproval of enemies, such as Umayyads and Abbasids.

Other personal copies of the Quran might have existed including Ibn Mas&#x27;ud&#x27;s and Ubay ibn Ka&#x27;b&#x27;s codex, none of which exist today.

==Academic research==

Studies on the Qur&#x27;an rarely went beyond textual criticism. Until the early 1970s, non-Muslim scholars of Islam —while not accepting traditional explanations for divine intervention— accepted the above-mentioned traditional origin story in most details.

University of Chicago professor Fred Donner states that:[T]here was a very early attempt to establish a uniform consonantal text of the Qurʾān from what was probably a wider and more varied group of related texts in early transmission.… After the creation of this standardized canonical text, earlier authoritative texts were suppressed, and all extant manuscripts—despite their numerous variants—seem to date to a time after this standard consonantal text was established.Although most variant readings of the text of the Quran have ceased to be transmitted, some still are. There has been no critical text produced on which a scholarly reconstruction of the Quranic text could be based.

In 1972, in a mosque in the city of Sana&#x27;a, Yemen, manuscripts &quot;consisting of 12,000 pieces&quot; were discovered that were later proven to be the oldest Quranic text known to exist at the time. The Sana&#x27;a manuscripts contain palimpsests, manuscript pages from which the text has been washed off to make the parchment reusable again—a practice which was common in ancient times due to the scarcity of writing material. However, the faint washed-off underlying text () is still barely visible. Studies using radiocarbon dating indicate that the parchments are dated to the period before 671 CE with a 99 percent probability. The German scholar Gerd R. Puin has been investigating these Quran fragments for years. His research team made 35,000 microfilm photographs of the manuscripts, which he dated to the early part of the 8th century. Puin has noted unconventional verse orderings, minor textual variations, and rare styles of orthography, and suggested that some of the parchments were palimpsests which had been reused. Puin believed that this implied an evolving text as opposed to a fixed one. It is also possible that the content of the Quran itself may provides data regarding the date of writing of the text. For example, sources based on some archaeological data give the construction date of Masjid al-Haram, an architectural work mentioned 16 times in the Quran, as 78 AH an additional finding that sheds light on the evolutionary history of the Quran mentioned, which is known to continue even during the time of Hajjaj, in a similar situation that can be seen with al-Aksa, though different suggestions have been put forward to explain.

In 2015, a single folio of a very early Quran, dating back to 1370 years earlier, was discovered in the library of the University of Birmingham, England. According to the tests carried out by the Oxford University Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, &quot;with a probability of more than 95%, the parchment was from between 568 and 645&quot;. The manuscript is written in Hijazi script, an early form of written Arabic. This possibly was one of the earliest extant exemplars of the Quran, but as the tests allow a range of possible dates, it cannot be said with certainty which of the existing versions is the oldest. Saudi scholar Saud al-Sarhan has expressed doubt over the age of the fragments as they contain dots and chapter separators that are believed to have originated later. The Birmingham manuscript caused excitement amongst believers because of its potential overlapping with the dominant tradition over the lifetime of Muhammad to 632 CE and used as evidence to support conventional wisdom and to refute the revisionists&#x27; views that expresses findings and views different from the traditional approach to the early history of the Quran and Islam.

== Contents ==

The Quranic content is concerned with basic Islamic beliefs including the existence of God and the resurrection. Narratives of the early prophets, ethical and legal subjects, historical events of Muhammad&#x27;s time, charity and prayer also appear in the Quran. The Quranic verses contain general exhortations regarding right and wrong and historical events are related to outline general moral lessons. The style of the Quran has been called &quot;allusive&quot;, with commentaries needed to explain what is being referred to—&quot;events are referred to, but not narrated; disagreements are debated without being explained; people and places are mentioned, but rarely named.&quot; While tafsir in Islamic sciences expresses the effort to understand the implied and implicit expressions of the Quran, fiqh refers to the efforts to expand the meaning of expressions, especially in the verses related to the provisions, as well as understanding it. 
Quranic studies state that, in the historical context, the content of the Quran is related to Rabbinic, Jewish-Christian, Syriac Christian and Hellenic literature, as well as pre-Islamic Arabia.
Many places, subjects and mythological figures in the culture of Arabs and many nations in their historical neighbourhoods, especially Judeo-Christian stories, are included in the Quran with small allusions, references or sometimes small narratives such as jannāt ʿadn, jahannam, Seven Sleepers, Queen of Sheba etc. However, some philosophers and scholars such as 
Mohammed Arkoun, who emphasize the mythological content of the Quran, are met with rejectionist attitudes in Islamic circles.

The stories of Yusuf and Zulaikha, Moses, Family of Amram (parents of Mary according to the Quran) and mysterious hero Dhul-Qarnayn (&quot;the man with two horns&quot;) who built a barrier against Gog and Magog that will remain until the end of time are more detailed and longer stories. Apart from semi-historical events and characters such as King Solomon and David, about Jewish history as well as the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, tales of the hebrew prophets accepted in Islam, such as Creation, the Flood, struggle of Abraham with Nimrod, sacrifice of his son occupy a wide place in the Quran.

=== Creation and God ===

The central theme of the Quran is monotheism. God is depicted as living, eternal, omniscient and omnipotent (see, e.g., Quran , , ). God&#x27;s omnipotence appears above all in his power to create. He is the creator of everything, of the heavens and the earth and what is between them (see, e.g., Quran , , , etc.). All human beings are equal in their utter dependence upon God, and their well-being depends upon their acknowledging that fact and living accordingly. The Quran uses cosmological and contingency arguments in various verses without referring to the terms to prove the existence of God. Therefore, the universe is originated and needs an originator, and whatever exists must have a sufficient cause for its existence. Besides, the design of the universe is frequently referred to as a point of contemplation: &quot;It is He who has created seven heavens in harmony. You cannot see any fault in God&#x27;s creation; then look again: Can you see any flaw?&quot;
Even though Muslims do not doubt about the existence and unity of God, they may have adopted different attitudes that have changed and developed throughout history regarding his nature (attributes), names and relationship with creation. Rabb is an Arabic word to refers to God meaning Lord and the Quran cites in several places as in the Al-Fatiha; &quot;All Praise and Gratitude is due to God, &quot;Lord&quot; of all the Universe&quot;. Mustafa Öztürk points out that the first Muslims believed that this god lived in the sky with the following words of Ahmad Ibn Hanbal: &quot;Whoever says that Allah is everywhere is a heretic, an infidel. He should be invited to repent, but if he does not, be killed.&quot; This understanding changes later and gives way to the understanding that &quot;God cannot be assigned a place and He is everywhere.&quot; Also actions and attributes suh as coming, going, sitting, satisfaction, anger and sadness etc. similar to humans used for this God in the Quran were considered mutashabihat -&quot;no one knows its interpretation except God&quot; ()- by later scholars stating that God was free from resemblance to humans in any way.

=== Prophets ===

In Islam, God speaks to people called prophets through a kind of revelation called &quot;wahy&quot;, or through angels.() &quot;nubuwwah&quot; ( &#x27;prophethood&#x27;) is seen as a duty imposed by God on individuals who have some characteristics such as intelligence, honesty, fortitude and justice: &quot;Nothing is said to you that was not said to the messengers before you, that your lord has at his Command forgiveness as well as a most Grievous Penalty.&quot;

Islam regards Abraham as a link in the chain of prophets that begins with Adam and culminates in Muhammad via Ishmael and mentioned in 35 chapters of the Quran, more often than any other biblical personage apart from Moses. Muslims regard him as a &quot;hanif&quot;, an archetype of the perfect Muslim, and revered prophet and builder of the Kaaba in Mecca. The Quran consistently refers to Islam as &#x27;the religion of Abraham&#x27; (). In Islam, Eid-al-Adha is celebrated to commemorate Abraham&#x27;s attempt to sacrifice his son by surrendering in line with his dream,(As-Saaffat; 100–107) which he accepted as the will of God.
In Islam, Moses is a prominent prophet and messenger of God and the most frequently mentioned individual in the Quran, with his name being mentioned 136 times and his life being narrated and recounted more than that of any other prophet.

Stories of the prophets in the Quran often revolve around a certain pattern, according to which a prophet is sent to a group of people, who then reject or attack him, and ultimately suffer extinction as God&#x27;s punishment. However, the Quran, given its paraenetic character, does not offer a full narrative; but rather offers a parabolic reference to the doom of previous generations, assuming the audience is familiar with the told stories.

=== Ethico-religious concepts ===
While belief in God and obedience to the prophets are the main emphasis in the prophetic stories, there are also non-prophetic stories in the Quran that emphasize the importance of humility and having profound-inner knowledge (hikmah) besides trusting in God. This is the main theme in the stories of Khidr, Luqman and Dhul Qarnayn. According to the later ascriptions to these stories, it is possible for those with this knowledge and divine support to teach the prophets (Khidr-Moses story Quran 18:65–82) and employ jinn (Dhul Qarnayn). Those who &quot;spend their wealth&quot; on people who are in need because they devoted their lives to the way of Allah and whose situation is unknown because they are ashamed to ask, will be rewarded by Allah. (Al Baqara; 272-274) In the story of Qārūn, the person who avoids searching for the afterlife with his wealth and becomes arrogant will be punished, arrogance befits only God. (Al Mutakabbir) Characters of the stories can be closed-mythical, (Khidr) demi-mythologic or combined characters, and it can also be seen that they are Islamized. While some believe he was a prophet, some researchers equate Luqman with the Alcmaeon of Croton or Aesop.

&quot;Commanding ma’ruf and forbidding munkar&quot; (Ar. ٱلْأَمْرُ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَٱلنَّهْيُ عَنِ ٱلْمُنْكَرِ) is repeated or referred to in nearly 30 verses in different contexts in the Quran and is an important part of Islamist / jihadist indoctrination today, as well as Shiite teachings. 

Although a common translation of the phrase is &quot;Enjoining good and forbidding evil&quot;, the words used by Islamic philosophy determining good and evil in discourses are &quot;husn&quot; and &quot;qubh&quot;. The word ma’ruf literally means &quot;known&quot; or what is approved because of its familiarity for a certain society and its antithesis munkar means what is disapproved because it is unknown and extraneous.

The Quran is one of the fundamental sources of Islamic law (&quot;sharia&quot;). Some formal religious practices receive significant attention in the Quran including the &quot;salat&quot; and fasting in the month of Ramadan. As for the manner in which the prayer is to be conducted, the Quran refers to prostration. The term chosen for charity, &quot;zakat&quot;, literally means purification implies that it is a self-purification. In fiqh, the term fard is used for clear imperative provisions based on the Quran. However, it is not possible to say that the relevant verses are understood in the same way by all segments of Islamic commentators; For example, Hanafis accept 5 daily prayers as fard. However, some religious groups such as Quranists and Shiites, who do not doubt that the Quran existing today is a religious source, infer from the same verses that it is clearly ordered to pray 2 or 3 times, not 5 times. About six verses adress to the way a woman should dress when in public; Some Muslim scholars consider this verse referring to the Hijab while others to clothings in general.

Research shows that the rituals in the Quran, along with laws such as qisas and tax (zakat), developed as an evolution of pre-Islamic Arabian rituals. Arabic words meaning pilgrimage (hajj), prayer (salāt) and charity (zakāt) can be seen in pre-Islamic Safaitic-Arabic inscriptions, and this continuity can be observed in many details, especially in hajj and umrah.

===As a source of law and judgment===

A small number of verses in the Quran are about general rules of governance, inheritance, marriage, crime and punishment. Although the Quran does not impose a specific legal-management system, it emphasizes custom in nearly 40 verses and commands justice. (An-Nahl; 90) The practices prescribed in the Quran are considered as reflections of contextual legal understandings, as can be clearly seen in some examples such as Qisas and Diya. The following statement in the Quran is thought to be the general rule of testimony in Islamic jurisprudence, except for crime and punishment - for example, debt, shopping, etc.; O believers! When you contract a loan for a fixed period of time, commit it to writing...with justice. Call upon two of your men to witness. If two men cannot be found, then one man and two women of your choice will witness so if one of the women forgets the other may remind her. . 

As a different example, in the necklace story of Aisha, called Asbab al-Nuzul for surah An-Nur :11-20 four witnesses were required for the accusation of adultery. In addition, those who made accusations that did not meet the specified conditions would be punished with 80 lashes. The jurisprudence of later periods stipulates that witnesses must be men, covering all hadd crimes and people who did not have credibility and honesty in society (slaves, non-adl; sinners, infidels) could not testify against believers. In addition, the Islamic judiciary did not require proof of the issues defined as tazir. The statement in the Qur&#x27;an that determines the status of slaves in community is; &quot;Ma malakat aymanuhum&quot; meaning &quot;those whom your right hands possess&quot;. The widespread use of slavery in the Islamic world continued until the last century, and the unrestricted sexual use of female slaves, with a few exceptions such as they couldn&#x27;t be loaned out in traditional islamic jurisprudence while stated today often that sharia provides many rights to slaves and aims to eradicate slavery over time. 

Sharia is a collection of laws and rules created by scholars&#x27; interpretations on the Qur&#x27;an and hadith collections, and has been developed over the centuries, changing according to different geographies and societies. Fiqh sects are schools of understanding that try to determine the actions that people should do or avoid based on the Quran and hadiths. The place of hadiths in legislation is controversial; for example, in the Hanafi sect, in order to claim that something is obligatory, that issue must be clearly expressed in the Quran. Some of these results may also indicate exaggeration of statements, generalizations taken out of context, and imperative broadening of scope. Of the few criminal cases listed as crimes in the Quran, only a few of them are punished by the classical books of sharia as determined by the verses of the Quran and are called hudud laws. How the verse Al-Ma&#x27;idah 33, which describes the crime of hirabah, should be understood is a matter of debate even today. The verse talks about the punishment of criminals by killing, hanging, having their hands and feet cut off on opposite sides, and being exiled from the earth, in response to an -abstract- crime such as &quot;fighting against Allah and His Messenger&quot;. Expanding or narrowing the conditions and scope of this crime according to new situations and universal legal standards are issues that continue to be discussed today such as punishing in addition to rebellion against the legitimate government on &quot;concrete sequential criminal acts&quot; ie massacre, robbery and rape as preconditions. 

Although the constitutions of most Muslim-majority states contain references to sharia, its rules are largely preserved only in family law and criminal law in some. The Islamic revival of the late 20th century brought calls by Islamic movements for the full implementation of sharia, including corporal punishment such as stoning for adultery, through a variety of propaganda methods, from civic political activities to terrorism.

=== Eschatology ===

The doctrine of the last day and eschatology (the final fate of the universe) may be considered the second great doctrine of the Quran. It is estimated that approximately one-third of the Quran is eschatological, dealing with the afterlife in the next world and with the day of judgment at the end of time. The Quran does not assert a natural immortality of the human soul, since man&#x27;s existence is dependent on the will of God: when he wills, he causes man to die; and when he wills, he raises him to life again in a bodily resurrection.
In the Quran belief in the afterlife is often referred in conjunction with belief in God: &quot;Believe in God and the last day&quot; emphasizing what is considered impossible is easy in the sight of God. A number of suras such as 44, 56, 75, 78, 81 and 101 are directly related to the afterlife and warn people to be prepared for the &quot;imminent&quot; day referred to in various ways. It is &#x27;the Day of Judgment,&#x27; &#x27;the Last Day,&#x27; &#x27;the Day of Resurrection,&#x27; or simply &#x27;the Hour.&#x27; Less frequently it is &#x27;the Day of Distinction&#x27;, &#x27;the Day of the Gathering&#x27; or &#x27;the Day of the Meeting&#x27;.

== Text and arrangement ==

The Quran consists of 114 chapters of varying lengths, known as a &quot;sūrah&quot;. Each sūrah consists of verses, known as &quot;āyāt&quot;, which originally means a &#x27;sign&#x27; or &#x27;evidence&#x27; sent by God. The number of verses differs from sūrah to sūrah. An individual verse may be just a few letters or several lines. The total number of verses in the most popular Hafs Quran is 6,236; however, the number varies if the &quot;bismillahs&quot; are counted separately. According to one estimate the Quran consists of 77,430 words, 18,994 unique words, 12,183 stems, 3,382 lemmas and 1,685 roots.
Chapters are classified as Meccan or Medinan, depending on whether the verses were revealed before or after the migration of Muhammad to the city of Medina on traditional account. However, a sūrah classified as Medinan may contain Meccan verses in it and vice versa. Sūrah names are derived from a name or a character in the text, or from the first letters or words of the sūrah. Chapters are not arranged in chronological order, rather the chapters appear to be arranged roughly in order of decreasing size. Each sūrah except the ninth starts with the &quot;Bismillah&quot; (), an Arabic phrase meaning &#x27;In the name of God.&#x27; There are, however, still 114 occurrences of the &quot;Bismillah&quot; in the Quran, due to its presence in Quran as the opening of Solomon&#x27;s letter to the Queen of Sheba.

The &quot;Muqattaʿat&quot; ( , &#x27;disjoined letters, disconnected letters&#x27;; also &#x27;mysterious letters&#x27;) are combinations of between one and five Arabic letters figuring at the beginning of 29 out of the 114 chapters of the Quran just after the basmala. The letters are also known as &quot;fawātih&quot; (), or &#x27;openers&#x27;, as they form the opening verse of their respective suras. Four surahs are named for their : &quot;Ṭāʾ-Hāʾ&quot;, &quot;Yāʾ-Sīn&quot;, &quot;Ṣād&quot;, and &quot;Qāf&quot;. Various theories have been put forward; they were a secret communication language between Allah and Muhammad, abbreviations of various names or attributes of Allah, symbols of the versions of the Quran belonging to different companions, elements of a secret coding system, or expressions containing esoteric meanings. Some researchers associate them with hymns used in Syrian Christianity. The phrases must have been part of these hymns or abbreviations of frequently repeated introductory phrases. Some of them, such as Nun, were used in symbolic meanings.

In addition of the division into chapters, there are various ways of dividing Quran into parts of approximately equal length for convenience in reading. The 30 &quot;juz&#x27;&quot; (plural ) can be used to read through the entire Quran in a month. A is sometimes further divided into two &quot;ḥizb&quot; (plural ), and each subdivided into four . The Quran is also divided into seven approximately equal parts, &quot;manzil&quot; (plural ), for it to be recited in a week. A different structure is provided by semantic units resembling paragraphs and comprising roughly ten each. Such a section is called a &quot;ruku&quot;.

=== Literary style ===
The Quran&#x27;s message is conveyed with various literary structures and devices. In the original Arabic, the suras and verses employ phonetic and thematic structures that assist the audience&#x27;s efforts to recall the message of the text. Muslims assert (according to the Quran itself) that the Quranic content and style is inimitable.

The language of the Quran has been described as &quot;rhymed prose&quot; as it partakes of both poetry and prose; however, this description runs the risk of failing to convey the rhythmic quality of Quranic language, which is more poetic in some parts and more prose-like in others. Rhyme, while found throughout the Quran, is conspicuous in many of the earlier Meccan suras, in which relatively short verses throw the rhyming words into prominence. The effectiveness of such a form is evident for instance in Sura 81, and there can be no doubt that these passages impressed the conscience of the hearers. Frequently a change of rhyme from one set of verses to another signals a change in the subject of discussion. Later sections also preserve this form but the style is more expository.

The Quranic text seems to have no beginning, middle, or end, its nonlinear structure being akin to a web or net. The textual arrangement is sometimes considered to exhibit lack of continuity, absence of any chronological or thematic order and repetitiousness. Michael Sells, citing the work of the critic Norman O. Brown, acknowledges Brown&#x27;s observation that the seeming disorganization of Quranic literary expression—its scattered or fragmented mode of composition in Sells&#x27;s phrase—is in fact a literary device capable of delivering profound effects as if the intensity of the prophetic message were shattering the vehicle of human language in which it was being communicated. Sells also addresses the much-discussed repetitiveness of the Quran, seeing this, too, as a literary device.

A text is self-referential when it speaks about itself and makes reference to itself. According to Stefan Wild, the Quran demonstrates this metatextuality by explaining, classifying, interpreting and justifying the words to be transmitted. Self-referentiality is evident in those passages where the Quran refers to itself as revelation (), remembrance (&quot;dhikr&quot;), news (), criterion () in a self-designating manner (explicitly asserting its Divinity, &quot;And this is a blessed Remembrance that We have sent down; so are you now denying it?&quot;), or in the frequent appearance of the &quot;Say&quot; tags, when Muhammad is commanded to speak (e.g., &quot;Say: &#x27;God&#x27;s guidance is the true guidance&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Say: &#x27;Would you then dispute with us concerning God?&#x27;&quot;). According to Wild the Quran is highly self-referential. The feature is more evident in early Meccan suras.

==== Inimitability ====

In Islam, (), &quot;inimitability challenge&quot; of the Qur&#x27;an in sense of feṣāḥa and belagha (both eloquence and rhetoric) is the doctrine which holds that the Qur’ān has a miraculous quality, both in content and in form, that no human speech can match. According to this, the Qur&#x27;an is a miracle and its inimitability is the proof granted to Muhammad in authentication of his prophetic status. The literary quality of the Qur&#x27;an has been praised by Muslim scholars and by many non-Muslim scholars. The doctrine of the miraculousness of the Quran is further emphasized by Muhammad&#x27;s illiteracy since the unlettered prophet could not have been suspected of composing the Quran.

The Quran is widely regarded as the finest work in Arabic literature. The emergence of the Qur’ān was an oral and aural poetic experience; the aesthetic experience of reciting and hearing the Qur’ān is often regarded as one of the main reasons behind conversion to Islam in the early days. Pre-Islamic Arabic poetry was an element of challenge, propaganda and warfare, and those who incapacitated their opponents from doing the same in feṣāḥa and belagha socially honored, as could be seen on Mu&#x27;allaqat poets. The etymology of the word &quot;shā&#x27;ir; (poet)&quot; connotes the meaning of a man of inspirational knowledge, of unseen powers. `To the early Arabs poetry was ṣihr ḥalāl and the poet was a genius who had supernatural communications with the jinn or spirits, the muses who inspired him.’ Although pre-Islamic Arabs gave poets status associated with suprahuman beings, soothsayers and prophecies were seen as persons of lower status. Contrary to later hurufic and recent scientific prophecy claims, traditional miracle statements about the Quran hadn&#x27;t focused on prophecies, with a few exceptions like the Byzantine victory over the Persians in wars that continued for hundreds of years with mutual victories and defeats.

The first works about the of the Quran began to appear in the 9th century in the Mu&#x27;tazila circles, which emphasized only its literary aspect, and were adopted by other religious groups. According to grammarian Al-Rummani the eloquence contained in the Quran consisted of tashbīh, istiʿāra, taǧānus, mubālaġa, concision, clarity of speech (bayān), and talāʾum. He also added other features developed by himself; the free variation of themes (taṣrīf al-maʿānī), the implication content (taḍmīn) of the expressions and the rhyming closures (fawāṣil). The most famous works on the doctrine of inimitability are two medieval books by the grammarian Al Jurjani (d. 1078 CE), &quot;Dala’il al-i&#x27;jaz&quot; (&#x27;the Arguments of Inimitability&#x27;) and &quot;Asraral-balagha&quot; (&#x27;the Secrets of Eloquence&#x27;). Al Jurjani believed that Qur&#x27;an&#x27;s eloquence must be a certain special quality in the manner of its stylistic arrangement and composition or a certain special way of joining words. Angelika Neuwirth lists the factors that led to the emergence of the doctrine of : The necessity of explaining some challenging verses in the Quran; In the context of the emergence of the theory of &quot;proofs of prophecy&quot; (dâ&#x27;il an-nubuwwa) in Islamic theology, proving that the Quran is a work worthy of the emphasized superior place of Muhammad in the history of the prophets, thus gaining polemical superiority over Jews and Christians; Preservation of Arab national pride in the face of confrontation with the Iranian Shu&#x27;ubiyya movement, etc. Orientalist scholars Theodor Nöldeke, Friedrich Schwally and John Wansbrough pointing out linguistic defects held a similar opinions on Qur&#x27;anic text as careless and imperfect.

== Significance in Islam ==
Quran says, &quot;We have sent down the Quran in truth, and with the truth it has come down&quot; and frequently asserts in its text that it is divinely ordained. The Quran speaks of a written pre-text that records God&#x27;s speech before it is sent down, the &quot;preserved tablet&quot; that is the basis of the belief in fate also, and Muslims believe that the Quran was sent down or started to be sent down on the Laylat al-Qadr.

Revered by pious Muslims as &quot;the holy of holies&quot;, whose sound moves some to &quot;tears and ecstasy&quot;, it is the physical symbol of the faith, the text often used as a charm on occasions of birth, death, marriage. Traditionally, before starting to read the Quran, ablution is performed, one seeks refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan, and the reading begins by mentioning the names of Allah, Rahman and Rahim together known as basmala. Consequently,
 It must never rest beneath other books, but always on top of them, one must never drink or smoke when it is being read aloud, and it must be listened to in silence. It is a talisman against disease and disaster.

According to Islam, the Quran is the word of God (). Its nature and whether it was created became a matter of fierce debate among religious scholars; and with the involvement of the political authority in the discussions, some Muslim religious scholars who stood against the political stance faced religious persecution during the caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun period and the following years.

Muslims believe that the present Quranic text corresponds to that revealed to Muhammad, and according to their interpretation of Quran , it is protected from corruption (&quot;Indeed, it is We who sent down the Quran and indeed, We will be its guardians&quot;). Muslims consider the Quran to be a sign of the prophethood of Muhammad and the truth of the religion. For this reason, in traditional Islamic societies, great importance was given to children memorizing the Quran, and those who memorized the entire Quran were honored with the title of hafiz. Even today, millions of Muslims frequently refer to the Quran to justify their actions and desires&quot;, and see it as the source of scientific knowledge, though some refer to it as weird or pseudoscience.

Muslims believe the Quran to be God&#x27;s literal words, a complete code of life, the final revelation to humanity, a work of divine guidance revealed to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel. On the other hand it is believed in Muslim community that full understanding of it can only be possible with the depths obtained in the basic and religious sciences that the ulema (imams in shia) might access, as &quot;heirs of the prophets&quot;. For this reason, direct reading of the Quran or applications based on its literal translations are considered problematic except for some groups such as Quranists thinking that the Quran is a complete and clear book; and tafsir / fiqh are brought fore to correct understandings in it. With a classical approach, scholars will discuss verses of the Qur&#x27;an in context called asbab al-nuzul in islamic literature, as well as language and linguistics; will pass it through filters such as muhkam and mutashabih, nasıkh and abrogated; will open the closed expressions and try to guide the believers. There is no standardization in Qur&#x27;an translations, and interpretations range from traditional scholastic, to literalist-salafist understandings to Esoteric-Sufist, to modern and secular exegesis according to the personal scientific depth and tendencies of scholars.

=== In worship ===

Surah Al-Fatiha, the first chapter of the Quran, is recited in full in every rakat of salah and on other occasions. This sura, which consists of seven verses, is the most often recited surah of the Quran:


Other sections of the Quran of choice are also read in daily prayers. Sura Al-Ikhlāṣ is second in frequency of Qur&#x27;an recitation, for according to many early authorities, Muhammad said that &quot;Ikhlāṣ&quot; is equivalent to one-third of the whole Quran.

Respect for the written text of the Quran is an important element of religious faith by many Muslims, and the Quran is treated with reverence. Based on tradition and a literal interpretation of Quran (&quot;none shall touch but those who are clean&quot;), some Muslims believe that they must perform a ritual cleansing with water (wudu or ghusl) before touching a copy of the Quran, although this view is not universal. 

Worn-out and old copies of the Quran are wrapped in a cloth and stored indefinitely in a safe place, buried in a mosque or a Muslim cemetery, or burned and the ashes buried or scattered over water. While praying, the Quran is only recited in Arabic.

In Islam, most intellectual disciplines, including Islamic theology, philosophy, mysticism and jurisprudence, have been concerned with the Quran or have their foundation in its teachings. Muslims believe that the preaching or reading of the Quran is rewarded with divine rewards variously called , &quot;thawab&quot;, or .

=== In Islamic art ===
The Quran also inspired Islamic arts and specifically the so-called Quranic arts of calligraphy and illumination. The Quran is never decorated with figurative images, but many Qurans have been highly decorated with decorative patterns in the margins of the page, or between the lines or at the start of suras. Islamic verses appear in many other media, on buildings and on objects of all sizes, such as mosque lamps, metal work, pottery and single pages of calligraphy for muraqqas or albums.

== Interpretation ==

&quot;Tafsir&quot; ( ; ) refers to an exegesis, or commentary, of the Quran. An author of a &quot;tafsir&quot; is a &quot;&quot; (; plural: ). A Quranic &quot;tafsir&quot; attempts to provide elucidation, explanation, interpretation, context or commentary for clear understanding and conviction of God&#x27;s will in Islam.

Principally, a &quot;tafsir&quot; deals with the issues of linguistics, jurisprudence, and theology. In terms of perspective and approach, &quot;tafsir&quot; can be broadly divided into two main categories, namely &quot;tafsir bi-al-ma&#x27;thur&quot; (lit. received tafsir), which is transmitted from the early days of Islam through the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his companions, and &quot;tafsir bi-al-ra&#x27;y&quot; (lit. &quot;tafsir&quot; by opinion), which is arrived through personal reflection or independent rational thinking.

There are different characteristics and traditions for each of the &quot;tafsirs&quot; representing respective schools and doctrines, such as Sunni Islam, Shia Islam, and Sufism. There are also general distinctions between classic &quot;tafsirs&quot; compiled by authoritative figures of Muslim scholarship during the formative ages of Islam, and modern &quot;tafsir&quot; which seeks to address a wider audience, including the common people.

=== Exoteric and Esoteric interpretations (&quot;ta&#x27;wil&quot;) ===

Commentaries dealing with the &quot;zahir&quot; (&#x27;outward aspects&#x27;) of the text are called , (explanation) and hermeneutic and esoteric commentaries dealing with the &quot;batin&quot; are called &quot;ta&#x27;wil&quot; (&#x27;interpretation&#x27;). Commentators with an esoteric slant believe that the ultimate meaning of the Quran is known only to God. Esoteric or Sufi interpretation relates Quranic verses to the inner or esoteric (&quot;batin&quot;) and metaphysical dimensions of existence and consciousness. According to Sands, esoteric interpretations are more suggestive than declarative, and are allusions () rather than explanations (&quot;tafsir&quot;). They indicate possibilities as much as they demonstrate the insights of writers.

Shias and Sunnis as well as some Muslim philosophers believe the meaning of the Quran is not restricted to the literal aspect. In contrast, Quranic literalism, followed by Salafis and Zahiris, is the belief that the Quran should only be taken at its apparent meaning. Henry Corbin narrates a hadith that goes back to Muhammad:

The Quran possesses an external appearance and a hidden depth, an exoteric meaning and an esoteric meaning. This esoteric meaning in turn conceals an esoteric meaning. So it goes on for seven esoteric meanings.

According to esoteric interpreters, the inner meaning of the Quran does not eradicate or invalidate its outward meaning. Rather, it is like the soul, which gives life to the body. Corbin considers the Quran to play a part in Islamic philosophy, because Gnosiology itself goes hand in hand with prophetology.

==== Notable Sufi commentaries ====
One of the notable authors of esoteric interpretation prior to the 12th century is al-Sulami&#x27;s (d. 1021) book named (&#x27;Truths of Exegesis&#x27;) is a compilation of commentaries of earlier Sufis. From the 11th century onwards several other works appear, including commentaries by Qushayri (d. 1074), Al-Daylami (d. 1193), Al-Shirazi (d. 1209) and Al-Suhrawardi (d. 1234). These works include material from Sulami&#x27;s books plus the author&#x27;s contributions. Many works are written in Persian such as the works of Al-Maybudi (d. 1135) (&#x27;the unveiling of the secrets&#x27;). Rumi (d. 1273) wrote a vast amount of mystical poetry in his book &quot;Mathnawi&quot; which some consider a kind of Sufi interpretation of the Quran. Simnani (d. 1336) tried reconciliation of God&#x27;s manifestation through and in the physical world notions with the sentiments of Sunni Islam. Ismail Hakki Bursevi&#x27;s (d. 1725) work (&#x27;the Spirit of Elucidation&#x27;) is a voluminous exegesis written in Arabic, combines the author&#x27;s own ideas with those of his predecessors (notably Ibn Arabi and Ghazali).

== Translations ==

Translating the Quran has always been problematic and difficult. Many argue that the Quranic text cannot be reproduced in another language or form. An Arabic word may have a range of meanings depending on the context, making an accurate translation difficult. Moreover, one of the biggest difficulties in understanding the Quran for those who do not know its language in the face of shifts in linguistic usage over the centuries is semantic translations (meanings) that include the translator&#x27;s contributions to the relevant text instead of literal ones. Although the author&#x27;s contributions are often bracketed and shown separately, the author&#x27;s individual tendencies may also come to the fore in making sense of the main text. These studies contain reflections and even distortions caused by the region, sect, education, ideology and knowledge of the people who made them, and efforts to reach the real content are drowned in the details of volumes of commentaries. These distortions can manifest themselves in many areas of belief and practices.

Islamic tradition also holds that translations were made for Negus of Abyssinia and Byzantine Emperor Heraclius, as both received letters by Muhammad containing verses from the Quran. In early centuries, the permissibility of translations was not an issue, but whether one could use translations in prayer. The Quran has been translated into most African, Asian, and European languages. The first translator of the Quran was Salman the Persian, who translated surat &quot;al-Fatiha&quot; into Persian during the seventh century. Another translation of the Quran was completed in 884 in Alwar (Sindh, India, now Pakistan) by the orders of Abdullah bin Umar bin Abdul Aziz on the request of the Hindu Raja Mehruk.

The first fully attested complete translations of the Quran were done between the 10th and 12th centuries in Persian. The Samanid king, Mansur I (961–976), ordered a group of scholars from Khorasan to translate the Tafsir al-Tabari, originally in Arabic, into Persian. Later in the 11th century, one of the students of Abu Mansur Abdullah al-Ansari wrote a complete &quot;tafsir&quot; of the Quran in Persian. In the 12th century, Najm al-Din Abu Hafs al-Nasafi translated the Quran into Persian. The manuscripts of all three books have survived and have been published several times. In 1936, translations in 102 languages were known. In 2010, the &quot;Hürriyet Daily News and Economic Review&quot; reported that the Quran was presented in 112 languages at the 18th International Quran Exhibition in Tehran.

Robert of Ketton&#x27;s 1143 translation of the Quran for Peter the Venerable, &quot;Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete&quot;, was the first into a Western language (Latin).
Alexander Ross offered the first English version in 1649, from the French translation of (1647) by Andre du Ryer. In 1734, George Sale produced the first scholarly translation of the Quran into English; another was produced by Richard Bell in 1937, and yet another by Arthur John Arberry in 1955. All these translators were non-Muslims. There have been numerous translations by Muslims. Popular modern English translations by Muslims include The Oxford World Classic&#x27;s translation by Muhammad Abdel Haleem, The Clear Quran by Mustafa Khattab, Sahih International&#x27;s translation, among various others. As with translations of the Bible, the English translators have sometimes favored archaic English words and constructions over their more modern or conventional equivalents; for example, two widely read translators, Abdullah Yusuf Ali and Marmaduke Pickthall, use the plural and singular &quot;ye&quot; and &quot;thou&quot; instead of the more common &quot;you&quot;.

The oldest Gurmukhi translation of the Quran Sharif has been found in village Lande of Moga district of Indian Punjab which was printed in 1911.

== Recitation ==

=== Rules of recitation ===

The proper recitation of the Quran is the subject of a separate discipline named &quot;tajwid&quot; which determines in detail how the Quran should be recited, how each individual syllable is to be pronounced, the need to pay attention to the places where there should be a pause, to elisions, where the pronunciation should be long or short, where letters should be sounded together and where they should be kept separate, etc. It may be said that this discipline studies the laws and methods of the proper recitation of the Quran and covers three main areas: the proper pronunciation of consonants and vowels (the articulation of the Quranic phonemes), the rules of pause in recitation and of resumption of recitation, and the musical and melodious features of recitation.

In order to avoid incorrect pronunciation, reciters follow a program of training with a qualified teacher. The two most popular texts used as references for rules are Matn al-Jazariyyah by Ibn al-Jazari and Tuhfat al-Atfal by Sulayman al-Jamzuri.

The recitations of a few Egyptian reciters, like El Minshawy, Al-Hussary, Abdul Basit, Mustafa Ismail, were highly influential in the development of current styles of recitation. Southeast Asia is well known for world-class recitation, evidenced in the popularity of the woman reciters such as Maria Ulfah of Jakarta. Today, crowds fill auditoriums for public Quran recitation competitions.

There are two types of recitation:

# is at a slower pace, used for study and practice.
# &quot;Mujawwad&quot; refers to a slow recitation that deploys heightened technical artistry and melodic modulation, as in public performances by trained experts. It is directed to and dependent upon an audience for the reciter seeks to involve the listeners.

=== Variant readings ===
The variant readings of the Quran are one type of textual variant. According to Melchert (2008), the majority of disagreements have to do with vowels to supply, most of them in turn not conceivably reflecting dialectal differences and about one in eight disagreements has to do with whether to place dots above or below the line. Nasser categorizes variant readings into various subtypes, including internal vowels, long vowels, gemination (&quot;shaddah&quot;), assimilation and alternation.

It is generally stated that there are small differences between readings. However, these small changes may also include differences that may lead to serious differences in Islam, ranging from the definition of God to practices such as the formal conditions of ablution.

The first Quranic manuscripts lacked marks, enabling multiple possible recitations to be conveyed by the same written text. The 10th-century Muslim scholar from Baghdad, Ibn Mujāhid, is famous for establishing seven acceptable textual readings of the Quran. He studied various readings and their trustworthiness and chose seven 8th-century readers from the cities of Mecca, Medina, Kufa, Basra and Damascus. Ibn Mujahid did not explain why he chose seven readers, rather than six or ten, but this may be related to a prophetic tradition (Muhammad&#x27;s saying) reporting that the Quran had been revealed in seven &quot;ahruf&quot;. Today, the most popular readings are those transmitted by Ḥafṣ (d. 796) and Warsh (d. 812) which are according to two of Ibn Mujahid&#x27;s reciters, Aasim ibn Abi al-Najud (Kufa, d. 745) and Nafiʽ al-Madani (Medina, d. 785), respectively. The influential standard Quran of Cairo uses an elaborate system of modified vowel-signs and a set of additional symbols for minute details and is based on ʻAsim&#x27;s recitation, the 8th-century recitation of Kufa. This edition has become the standard for modern printings of the Quran. Occasionally, an early Quran shows compatibility with a particular reading. A Syrian manuscript from the 8th century is shown to have been written according to the reading of Ibn Amir ad-Dimashqi. Another study suggests that this manuscript bears the vocalization of himsi region.

According to Ibn Taymiyyah vocalization markers indicating specific vowel sounds (&quot;tashkeel&quot;) were introduced into the text of the Qur&#x27;an during the lifetimes of the last Sahabah.

== Writing and printing ==
=== Writing ===

Before printing was widely adopted in the 19th century, the Quran was transmitted in manuscripts made by calligraphers and copyists. The earliest manuscripts were written in &quot;Ḥijāzī&quot;-typescript. The &quot;Hijazi&quot; style manuscripts nevertheless confirm that transmission of the Quran in writing began at an early stage. Probably in the ninth century, scripts began to feature thicker strokes, which are traditionally known as &quot;Kufic&quot; scripts. Toward the end of the ninth century, new scripts began to appear in copies of the Quran and replace earlier scripts. The reason for discontinuation in the use of the earlier style was that it took too long to produce and the demand for copies was increasing. Copyists would therefore choose simpler writing styles. Beginning in the 11th century, the styles of writing employed were primarily the &quot;naskh&quot;, &quot;muhaqqaq&quot;, &quot;rayḥānī&quot; and, on rarer occasions, the &quot;thuluth&quot; script. &quot;Naskh&quot; was in very widespread use. In North Africa and Iberia, the &quot;Maghribī&quot; style was popular. More distinct is the &quot;Bihari&quot; script which was used solely in the north of India. &quot;Nastaʻlīq&quot; style was also rarely used in Persian world.

In the beginning, the Quran was not written with dots or tashkeel. These features were added to the text during the lifetimes of the last of the Sahabah. Since it would have been too costly for most Muslims to purchase a manuscript, copies of the Quran were held in mosques in order to make them accessible to people. These copies frequently took the form of a series of 30 parts or &quot;juzʼ&quot;. In terms of productivity, the Ottoman copyists provide the best example. This was in response to widespread demand, unpopularity of printing methods and for aesthetic reasons.

Whilst the majority of Islamic scribes were men, some women also worked as scholars and copyists; one such woman who made a copy of this text was the Moroccan jurist, Amina, bint al-Hajj ʿAbd al-Latif.
=== Printing ===

Wood-block printing of extracts from the Quran is on record as early as the 10th century.

Arabic movable type printing was ordered by Pope Julius II () for distribution among Middle Eastern Christians. The first complete Quran printed with movable type was produced in Venice in 1537–1538 for the Ottoman market by Paganino Paganini and Alessandro Paganini. But this Quran was not used as it contained a large number of errors. Two more editions include the Hinckelmann edition published by the pastor Abraham Hinckelmann in Hamburg in 1694, and the edition by the Italian priest Ludovico Maracci in Padua in 1698 with Latin translation and commentary.

Printed copies of the Quran during this period met with strong opposition from Muslim legal scholars: printing anything in Arabic was prohibited in the Ottoman empire between 1483 and 1726—initially, even on penalty of death. The Ottoman ban on printing in Arabic script was lifted in 1726 for non-religious texts only upon the request of Ibrahim Muteferrika, who printed his first book in 1729. Except for books in Hebrew and European languages, which were unrestricted, very few books, and no religious texts, were printed in the Ottoman Empire for another century.

In 1786, Catherine the Great of Russia, sponsored a printing press for &quot;Tatar and Turkish orthography&quot; in Saint Petersburg, with one Mullah Osman Ismail responsible for producing the Arabic types. A Quran was printed with this press in 1787, reprinted in 1790 and 1793 in Saint Petersburg, and in 1803 in Kazan. The first edition printed in Iran appeared in Tehran (1828), a translation in Turkish was printed in Cairo in 1842, and the first officially sanctioned Ottoman edition was finally printed in Constantinople between 1875 and 1877 as a two-volume set, during the First Constitutional Era.

Gustav Flügel published an edition of the Quran in 1834 in Leipzig, which remained authoritative in Europe for close to a century, until Cairo&#x27;s Al-Azhar University published an edition of the Quran in 1924. This edition was the result of a long preparation, as it standardized Quranic orthography, and it remains the basis of later editions.

== Criticism ==
Regarding the claim of divine origin, critics refer to pre-existing sources, not only taken from the Bible, supposed to be older revelations of God, but also from heretic, Apocryphic and talmudic sources, such as the Syriac Infancy Gospel and Gospel of James. The Quran acknowledges that accusations of borrowing popular ancient fables were being made against Muhammad.

== Relationship with other literature ==
Some non-Muslim groups such as the Baháʼí Faith and Druze view the Quran as holy. In the Baháʼí Faith, the Quran is accepted as authentic revelation from God along with the revelations of the other world religions, Islam being a stage within the divine process of progressive revelation. Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, the Prophet-Founder of the Baháʼí Faith, testified to the validity of the Quran, writing, say: &quot;Perused ye not the Qur&#x27;án? Read it, that haply ye may find the Truth, for this Book is verily the Straight Path. This is the Way of God unto all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth.&quot; Unitarian Universalists may also seek inspiration from the Quran. It has been suggested that the Quran has some narrative similarities to the Diatessaron, Protoevangelium of James, Infancy Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew and the Arabic Infancy Gospel. One scholar has suggested that the Diatessaron, as a gospel harmony, may have led to the conception that the Christian Gospel is one text.

=== The Bible ===

The Quran attributes its relationship with former books (the Torah and the Gospels) to their unique origin, saying all of them have been revealed by the one God.

According to Christoph Luxenberg (in &quot;The Syro-Aramaic Reading of the Koran&quot;) the Quran&#x27;s language was similar to the Syriac language. The Quran recounts stories of many of the people and events recounted in Jewish and Christian sacred books (Tanakh, Bible) and devotional literature (Apocrypha, Midrash), although it differs in many details. Adam, Enoch, Noah, Eber, Shelah, Abraham, Lot, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Job, Jethro, David, Solomon, Elijah, Elisha, Jonah, Aaron, Moses, Zechariah, John the Baptist and Jesus are mentioned in the Quran as prophets of God (see Prophets of Islam). In fact, Moses is mentioned more in the Quran than any other individual. Jesus is mentioned more often in the Quran than Muhammad (by name—Muhammad is often alluded to as &quot;The Prophet&quot; or &quot;The Apostle&quot;), while Mary is mentioned in the Quran more than in the New Testament.

=== Arab writing ===
After the Quran, and the general rise of Islam, the Arabic alphabet developed rapidly into an art form. The Arabic grammarian Sibawayh wrote one of the earliest books on Arabic grammar, referred to as &quot;Al-Kitab&quot;, which relied heavily on the language in the Quran. Wadad Kadi, Professor of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations at University of Chicago, and Mustansir Mir, Professor of Islamic studies at Youngstown State University, state that the Quran exerted a particular influence on Arabic literature&#x27;s diction, themes, metaphors, motifs and symbols and added new expressions and new meanings to old, pre-Islamic words that would become ubiquitous.

<text>A television broadcaster or television network is a telecommunications network for the distribution of television content, where a central operation provides programming to many television stations, pay television providers or, in the United States, multichannel video programming distributors. Until the mid-1980s, broadcast programming on television in most countries of the world was dominated by a small number of terrestrial networks. Many early television networks such as the BBC, CBC, PBS, PTV, NBC or ABC in the US and in Australia evolved from earlier radio networks.

==Overview==
In countries where most networks broadcast identical, centrally originated content to all of their stations, and where most individual television transmitters therefore operate only as large &quot;repeater stations&quot;, the terms &quot;television network&quot;, &quot;television channel&quot; (a numeric identifier or radio frequency) and &quot;television station&quot; have become mostly interchangeable in everyday language, with professionals in television-related occupations continuing to make a differentiation between them. Within the industry, a tiering is sometimes created among groups of networks based on whether their programming is simultaneously originated from a central point, and whether the network master control has the technical and administrative capability to take over the programming of their affiliates in real-time when it deems this necessary – the most common example being during national breaking news events.

In North America in particular, many television networks available via cable and satellite television are branded as &quot;channels&quot; because they are somewhat different from traditional networks in the sense defined above, as they are singular operations – they have no affiliates or component stations, but instead are distributed to the public via cable or direct-broadcast satellite providers. Such networks are commonly referred to by terms such as &quot;specialty channels&quot; in Canada or &quot;cable networks&quot; in the U.S.

A network may or may not produce all of its own programming. If not, production companies (such as Warner Bros. Television, Universal Television, Sony Pictures Television and TriStar Television) can distribute their content to the various networks, and it is common that a certain production firm may have programs that air on two or more rival networks. Similarly, some networks may import television programs from other countries, or use archived programming to help complement their schedules.

Some stations have the capability to interrupt the network through the local insertion of television commercials, station identifications and emergency alerts. Others completely break away from the network for their own programming, a method known as regional variation. This is common where small networks are members of larger networks. The majority of commercial television stations are self-owned, even though a variety of these instances are the property of an owned-and-operated television network. The commercial television stations can also be linked with a noncommercial educational broadcasting agency. Some countries have launched national television networks, so that individual television stations can act as common repeaters of nationwide programs.

On the other hand, television networks also undergo the impending experience of major changes related to cultural varieties. The emergence of cable television has made available in major media markets, programs such as those aimed at American bi-cultural Latinos. Such a diverse captive audience presents an occasion for the networks and affiliates to advertise the best programming that needs to be aired.

This is explained by author Tim P. Vos in his abstract &quot;A Cultural Explanation of Early Broadcast&quot;, where he determines targeted group/non-targeted group representations as well as the cultural specificity employed in the television network entity. Vos notes that policymakers did not expressly intend to create a broadcast order dominated by commercial networks. In fact, legislative attempts were made to limit the network&#x27;s preferred position.

As to individual stations, modern network operations centers usually use broadcast automation to handle most tasks. These systems are not only used for programming and for video server playout, but use exact atomic time from Global Positioning Systems or other sources to maintain perfect synchronization with upstream and downstream systems, so that programming appears seamless to viewers.

==Global==
A major international television broadcaster is the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), which is perhaps most-well known for its news agency BBC News. Owned by the Crown, the BBC funds itself in two ways. UK services branded under BBC are funded by the television license paid by British residents, as a result no advertising appears on these services. The advertising-funded arm (BBC Studios) employs 23,000 people worldwide including the operation of broadcaster UKTV in the UK itself. Experimental television broadcasts were started in 1929, using an electromechanical 30-line system developed by John Logie Baird. Limited regular broadcasts using this system began in 1934 and an expanded service (now known as BBC Television) started from Alexandra Palace in November 1936.

==History==

Electronic television was made and demonstrated in San Francisco, on September 7, 1927, it was designed by Philo Taylor Fransworth who has been working on it since 1920. 

==United States==

Television in the United States had long been dominated by the Big Three television networks, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), CBS (formerly the Columbia Broadcasting System) and the National Broadcasting Company (NBC); however, the Fox Broadcasting Company (Fox), which launched in October 1986, has gained prominence and is now considered part of the &quot;Big Four&quot;. The Big Three provide a significant number of programs to each of their affiliates, including newscasts, prime time, daytime and sports programming, but still reserve periods during each day where their affiliate can air local programming, such as local news or syndicated programs. Since the creation of Fox, the number of American television networks has increased, though the amount of programming they provide is often much less: for example, The CW only provides fifteen hours of primetime programming each week (along with three hours on Saturdays), while MyNetworkTV only provides ten hours of primetime programming each week, leaving their affiliates to fill time periods where network programs are not broadcast with a large amount of syndicated programming. Other networks are dedicated to specialized programming, such as religious content or programs presented in languages other than English, particularly Spanish.

The largest television network in the United States, however, is the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), a non-profit, publicly owned, non-commercial educational service. In comparison to the commercial television networks, there is no central unified arm of broadcast programming, meaning that each PBS member station has a significant amount of freedom to schedule television shows as they consent to. Some public television outlets, such as PBS, carry separate digital subchannel networks through their member stations (for example, Georgia Public Broadcasting; in fact, some programs airing on PBS were branded on other channels as coming from GPB Kids and PBS World).

This works as each network sends its signal to many local affiliated television stations across the country. These local stations then carry the &quot;network feed&quot;, which can be viewed by millions of households across the country. In such cases, the signal is sent to as many as 200+ stations or as little as just a dozen or fewer stations, depending on the size of the network.

With the adoption of digital television, television networks have also been created specifically for distribution on the digital subchannels of television stations (including networks focusing on classic television series and films operated by companies like Weigel Broadcasting (owners of Movies! and Me-TV) and Nexstar Media Group (owners of Rewind TV and Antenna TV), along with networks focusing on music, sports and other niche programming).

Cable and satellite providers pay the networks a certain rate per subscriber (the highest charge being for ESPN, in which cable and satellite providers pay a rate of more than $5.00 per subscriber to ESPN). The providers also handle the sale of advertising inserted at the local level during national programming, in which case the broadcaster and the cable/satellite provider may share revenue. Networks that maintain a home shopping or infomercial format may instead pay the station or cable/satellite provider, in a brokered carriage deal. This is especially common with low-power television stations, and in recent years, even more so for stations that used this revenue stream to finance their conversion to digital broadcasts, which in turn provides them with several additional channels to transmit different programming sources.

===History===
Television broadcasting in the United States was heavily influenced by radio. Early individual experimental radio stations in the United States began limited operations in the 1910s. In November 1920, Westinghouse signed on &quot;the world&#x27;s first commercially licensed radio station&quot;, KDKA in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Other companies built early radio stations in Detroit, Boston, New York City and other areas. Radio stations received permission to transmit through broadcast licenses obtained through the Federal Radio Commission (FRC), a government entity that was created in 1926 to regulate the radio industry. With some exceptions, radio stations east of the Mississippi River received official call signs beginning with the letter &quot;W&quot;; those west of the Mississippi were assigned calls beginning with a &quot;K&quot;. The number of programs that these early stations aired was often limited, in part due to the expense of program creation. The idea of a network system which would distribute programming to many stations simultaneously, saving each station the expense of creating all of their own programs and expandingus transmitted from station to station to listeners across the United States. Other companies, including CBS and the Mutual Broadcasting System, soon followed suit, each network signed hundreds of individual stations on as affiliates: stations which agreed to broadcast programs from one of the networks.

As radio prospered throughout the 1920s and 1930s, experimental television stations, which broadcast both an audio and a video signal, began sporadic broadcasts. Licenses for these experimental stations were often granted to experienced radio broadcasters, and thus advances in television technology closely followed breakthroughs in radio technology. As interest in television grew, and as early television stations began regular broadcasts, the idea of networking television signals (sending one station&#x27;s video and audio signal to outlying stations) was born. However, the signal from an electronic television system, containing much more information than a radio signal, required a broadband transmission medium. Transmission by a nationwide series of radio relay towers would be possible but extremely expensive.

Researchers at AT&amp;T subsidiary Bell Telephone Laboratories patented coaxial cable in 1929, primarily as a telephone improvement device. Its high capacity (transmitting 240 telephone calls simultaneously) also made it ideal for long-distance television transmission, where it could handle a frequency band of 1 MHz. German television first demonstrated such an application in 1936 by relaying televised telephone calls from Berlin to Leipzig, away, by cable.

AT&amp;T laid the first L-carrier coaxial cable between New York City and Philadelphia, with automatic signal booster stations every , and in 1937 it experimented with transmitting televised motion pictures over the line. Bell Labs gave demonstrations of the New York–Philadelphia television link in 1940 and 1941. AT&amp;T used the coaxial link to transmit the Republican National Convention in June 1940 from Philadelphia to New York City, where it was televised to a few hundred receivers over the NBC station W2XBS (which evolved into WNBC) as well as seen in Schenectady, New York via W2XB (which evolved into WRGB) via off-air relay from the New York station.

NBC had earlier demonstrated an inter-city television broadcast on 1 February 1940, from its station in New York City to another in Schenectady, New York by General Electric relay antennas, and began transmitting some programs on an irregular basis to Philadelphia and Schenectady in 1941. Wartime priorities suspended the manufacture of television and radio equipment for civilian use from 1 April 1942 to 1 October 1945, temporarily shutting down expansion of television networking. However, in 1944 a short film, &quot;Patrolling the Ether&quot;, was broadcast simultaneously over three stations as an experiment.
AT&amp;T made its first postwar addition in February 1946, with the completion of a cable between New York City and Washington, D.C., although a blurry demonstration broadcast showed that it would not be in regular use for several months. The DuMont Television Network, which had begun experimental broadcasts before the war, launched what &quot;Newsweek&quot; called &quot;the country&#x27;s first permanent commercial television network&quot; on 15 August 1946, connecting New York City with Washington. Not to be outdone, NBC launched what it called &quot;the world&#x27;s first regularly operating television network&quot; on 27 June 1947, serving New York City, Philadelphia, Schenectady and Washington. Baltimore and Boston were added to the NBC television network in late 1947. DuMont and NBC would be joined by CBS and ABC in 1948.

In the 1940s, the term &quot;chain broadcasting&quot; was used when discussing network broadcasts, as the television stations were linked together in long chains along the East Coast. But as the television networks expanded westward, the interconnected television stations formed major networks of connected affiliate stations. In January 1949, with the sign-on of DuMont&#x27;s WDTV in Pittsburgh, the Midwest and East Coast networks were finally connected by coaxial cable (with WDTV airing the best shows from all four networks). By 1951, the four networks stretched from coast to coast, carried on the new microwave radio relay network of AT&amp;T Long Lines. Only a few local television stations remained independent of the networks.

Each of the four major television networks originally only broadcast a few hours of programs a week to their affiliate stations, mostly between 8:00 and 11:00 p.m. Eastern Time, when most viewers were watching television. Most of the programs broadcast by the television stations were still locally produced. As the networks increased the number of programs that they aired, however, officials at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) grew concerned that local television might disappear altogether. Eventually, the federal regulator enacted the Prime Time Access Rule, which restricted the amount of time that the networks could air programs; officials hoped that the rules would foster the development of quality local programs, but in practice, most local stations did not want to bear the burden of producing many of their own programs, and instead chose to purchase programs from independent producers. Sales of television programs to individual local stations are done through a method called &quot;broadcast syndication&quot;, and today nearly every television station in the United States obtains syndicated programs in addition to network-produced fare.

Late in the 20th century, cross-country microwave radio relays were replaced by fixed-service satellites. Some terrestrial radio relays remained in service for regional connections.

After the failure and shutdown of DuMont in 1956, several attempts at new networks were made between the 1950s and the 1970s, with little success. The Fox Broadcasting Company, founded by the Rupert Murdoch-owned News Corporation (now owned by Fox Corporation), was launched on 9 October 1986 after the company purchased the television assets of Metromedia; it would eventually ascend to the status of the fourth major network by 1994. Two other networks launched within a week of one another in January 1995: The WB Television Network, a joint venture between Time Warner and the Tribune Company, and the United Paramount Network (UPN), formed through a programming alliance between Chris-Craft Industries and Paramount Television (whose parent, Viacom, would later acquire half and later all of the network over the course of its existence). In September 2006, The CW was launched as a &quot;merger&quot; of The WB and UPN (in actuality, a consolidation of each respective network&#x27;s higher-rated programs onto one schedule); MyNetworkTV, a network formed from affiliates of UPN and The WB that did not affiliate with The CW, launched at the same time.

===Regulation===
FCC regulations in the United States restricted the number of television stations that could be owned by any one network, company or individual. This led to a system where most local television stations were independently owned, but received programming from the network through a franchising contract, except in a few major cities that had owned-and-operated stations (O&amp;O) of a network and independent stations. In the early days of television, when there were often only one or two stations broadcasting in a given market, the stations were usually affiliated with multiple networks and were able to choose which programs would air. Eventually, as more stations were licensed, it became common for each station to be exclusively affiliated with only one network and carry all of the &quot;prime-time&quot; programs that the network offered. Local stations occasionally break from regularly scheduled network programming however, especially when a breaking news or severe weather situation occurs in the viewing area. Moreover, when stations return to network programming from commercial breaks, station identifications are displayed in the first few seconds before switching to the network&#x27;s logo.

==Canada==

A number of different definitions of &quot;network&quot; are used by government agencies, industry, and the general public. Under the Broadcasting Act, a network is defined as &quot;any operation where control over all or any part of the programs or program schedules of one or more broadcasting undertakings is delegated to another undertaking or person&quot;, and must be licensed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).

Only three national over-the-air television networks are currently licensed by the CRTC: government-owned CBC Television (English) and Ici Radio-Canada Télé (French), French-language private network TVA, and APTN, a network focused on Indigenous peoples in Canada. A third French-language service, Noovo (formerly V), is licensed as a provincial network within Quebec, but is not licensed or locally distributed (outside of carriage on the digital tiers of pay television providers) on a national basis.

Currently, licensed national or provincial networks must be carried by all cable providers (in the country or province, respectively) with a service area above a certain population threshold, as well as all satellite providers. However, they are no longer necessarily expected to achieve over-the-air coverage in all areas (APTN, for example, only has terrestrial coverage in parts of northern Canada).

In addition to these licensed networks, the two main private English-language over-the-air services, CTV and Global, are also generally considered to be &quot;networks&quot; by virtue of their national coverage, although they are not officially licensed as such. CTV was previously a licensed network, but relinquished this license in 2001 after acquiring most of its affiliates, making operating a network license essentially redundant (per the above definition).

Smaller groups of stations with common branding are often categorized by industry watchers as television systems, although the public and the broadcasters themselves will often refer to them as &quot;networks&quot; regardless. Some of these systems, such as CTV 2 and the now-defunct E!, essentially operate as mini-networks, but have reduced geographical coverage. Others, such as Omni Television or the Crossroads Television System, have similar branding and a common programming focus, but schedules may vary significantly from one station to the next. Citytv originally began operating as a television system in 2002 when CKVU-TV in Vancouver started to carry programs originating from CITY-TV in Toronto and adopted that station&#x27;s &quot;Citytv&quot; branding, but gradually became a network by virtue of national coverage through expansions into other markets west of Atlantic Canada between 2005 and 2013.

Most local television stations in Canada are now owned and operated directly by their network, with only a small number of stations still operating as affiliates.

==Europe, Asia, Africa and South America==
Most television services outside North America are national networks established by a combination of publicly funded broadcasters and commercial broadcasters. Most nations established television networks in a similar way: the first television service in each country was operated by a public broadcaster, often funded by a television licensing fee, and most of them later established a second or even third station providing a greater variety of content. Commercial television services also became available when private companies applied for television broadcasting licenses. Often, each new network would be identified with their channel number, so that individual stations would often be numbered &quot;One&quot;, &quot;Two&quot;, &quot;Three&quot; and so forth.

===United Kingdom===

The first television network in the United Kingdom was operated by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). On 2 November 1936 the BBC opened the world&#x27;s first regular high-definition television service, from a 405 lines transmitter at Alexandra Palace. The BBC remained dominant until eventually on 22 September 1955, commercial broadcasting was established to create a second television network. Rather than creating a single network with local channels owned and operated by a single company (as is the case with the BBC), each local area had a separate television channel that was independently owned and operated, although most of these channels shared a number of programmes, particularly during peak evening viewing hours. These channels formed the ITV network.

When the advent of UHF broadcasting allowed a greater number of television channels to broadcast, the BBC launched a second channel, BBC 2 (with the original service being renamed BBC 1). A second national commercial network was launched Channel 4, although Wales instead introduced a Welsh-language service, S4C. These were later followed by the launch of a third commercial network, Channel 5. Since the introduction of digital television, the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 each introduced a number of digital-only channels. Sky operates a large number of channels, as does UKTV.

===Sweden===
Sweden had only one television network from 1956 until the early-1990s: the public broadcaster Sveriges Television (SVT). Commercial companies such as Modern Times Group, TV4, Viasat, and SBS Discovery have established TV networks since the 1980s although they initially aired exclusively on satellite. In 1991, TV4 became Sweden&#x27;s first commercial television network to air terrestrially. Most television programming in Sweden is centralised except for local news updates that air on SVT2 and TV4.

===Netherlands===
Until 1989, Netherlands Public Broadcasting was the only television network in the Netherlands, with three stations, Nederland 1, Nederland 2 and Nederland 3. Rather than having a single production arm, there are a number of public broadcasting organizations that create programming for each of the three stations, each working relatively independently. Commercial broadcasting in the Netherlands is currently operated by two networks, RTL Nederland and SBS Broadcasting, which together broadcast seven commercial stations.

===Russia===
====Soviet era====
The first television network in the Soviet Union launched on 7 July 1938 when Petersburg – Channel 5 of Leningrad Television became a unionwide network.
The second television network in the Soviet Union launched on 22 March 1951 when Channel One of USSR Central Television became a unionwide network. Until 1989, there were six television networks, all owned by the USSR Gosteleradio. This changed during Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s Perestroika program, when the first independent television network, 2×2, was launched.

====1990s====
Following the breakup of the Soviet Union, USSR Gosteleradio ceased to exist as well as its six networks. Only Channel One had a smooth transition and survived as a network, becoming Ostankino Channel One. The other five networks were operated by Ground Zero. This free airwave space allowed many private television networks like NTV and TV-6 to launch in the mid-1990s.

====2000s====
The 2000s were marked by the increased state intervention in Russian television. On 14 April 2001 NTV experienced management changes following the expulsion of former oligarch and NTV founder Vladimir Gusinsky. As a result, most of the prominent reporters featured on NTV left the network. Later on 22 January 2002, the second largest private television network TV-6, where the former NTV staff took refuge, was shut down allegedly because of its editorial policy. Five months later on 1 June, TVS was launched, mostly employing NTV/TV-6 staff, only to cease operations the following year. Since then, the four largest television networks (Channel One, Russia 1, NTV and Russia 2) have been state-owned.

Still, the 2000s saw a rise of several independent television networks such as REN (its coverage increased vastly allowing it to become a federal network), Petersburg – Channel Five (overall the same), the relaunched 2×2. The Russian television market is mainly shared today by five major companies: Channel One, Russia 1, NTV, TNT and CTC.

===Brazil===

The major commercial television network in Brazil is TV Globo, which was founded in 1965. It grew to become the largest and most successful media conglomerate in the country, having a dominating presence in various forms of media including television, radio, print (newspapers and magazines) and the Internet.

Other networks include Band, Record, SBT, RedeTV!, TV Cultura, and TV Brasil.

==Australia==

Australia has two national public networks, ABC Television and SBS. The ABC operates eight stations as part of its main network ABC TV, one for each state and territory, as well as three digital-only networks, ABC Kids / ABC TV Plus, ABC Me and ABC News. SBS currently operates six stations, SBS, SBS Viceland, SBS World Movies, SBS Food, NITV and SBS WorldWatch.

The first commercial networks in Australia involved commercial stations that shared programming in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and later Perth, with each network forming networks based on their allocated channel numbers: TCN-9 in Sydney, GTV-9 in Melbourne, QTQ-9 in Brisbane, NWS-9 in Adelaide and STW-9 in Perth together formed the Nine Network; while their equivalents on VHF channels 7 and 10 respectively formed the Seven Network and Network 10. Until 1989, areas outside these main cities had access to only a single commercial station, and these rural stations often formed small networks such as Prime Television. Beginning in 1989, however, television markets in rural areas began to aggregate, allowing these rural networks to broadcast over a larger area, often an entire state, and become full-time affiliates to one specific metropolitan network.

As well as these free-to-air channels, there are others on Australia&#x27;s Pay television network Foxtel.

==New Zealand==

New Zealand has one public network, Television New Zealand (TVNZ), which consists of two main networks: TVNZ 1 is the network&#x27;s flagship network which carries news, current affairs and sports programming as well as the majority of the locally produced shows broadcast by TVNZ and imported shows. TVNZ&#x27;s second network, TV2, airs mostly imported shows with some locally produced programs such as &quot;Shortland Street&quot;. TVNZ also operates a network exclusive to pay television services, TVNZ Heartland, available on providers such as Sky. TVNZ previously operated a non-commercial public service network, TVNZ 7, which ceased operations in June 2012 and was replaced by the timeshift channel TV One Plus 1. The network operated by Television New Zealand has progressed from operating as four distinct local stations within the four main centers in the 1960s, to having the majority of the content produced from TVNZ&#x27;s Auckland studios at present.

New Zealand also has several privately owned television networks with the largest being operated by MediaWorks. MediaWorks&#x27; flagship network is TV3, which competes directly with both TVNZ broadcast networks. MediaWorks also operates a second network, FOUR, which airs mostly imported programmes with children&#x27;s shows airing in the daytime and shows targeted at teenagers and adult between 15 and 39 years of age during prime time. MediaWorks also operates a timeshift network, TV3 + 1, and a 24-hour music network, C4.

All television networks in New Zealand air the same programming across the entire country with the only regional deviations being for local advertising; a regional news service existed in the 1980s, carrying a regional news programme from TVNZ&#x27;s studios in New Zealand&#x27;s four largest cities, Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin.

In the 1960s, the service operated at the time by the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation was four separate television stations – AKTV2 in Auckland, WNTV1 in Wellington, CHTV3 in Christchurch and DNTV2 in Dunedin – which each ran their own newscast and produced some in-house programmes, with other shows being shared between the stations. Programmes and news footage were distributed via mail, with a programme airing in one region being mailed to another region for broadcast the following week. A network was finally established in 1969, with the same programmes being relayed to all regions simultaneously. From the 1970s to the 1990s, locally produced programmes that aired on TV One and TV2 were produced out of one of the four main studios, with TVNZ&#x27;s network hub based in Wellington. Today, most locally produced programmes that are aired by both TVNZ and other networks are not actually produced in-house, instead they are often produced by a third party company (for example, the TV2 programme &quot;Shortland Street&quot; is produced by South Pacific Pictures). The networks produce their own news and current affairs programs, with most of the content filmed in Auckland.

New Zealand also operates several regional television stations, which are only available in individual markets. The regional stations will typically air a local news programme, produce some shows in-house and cover local sports events; the majority of programming on the regional stations will be imported from various sources.

==Philippines==

In the Philippines, in practice, the terms &quot;network&quot;, &quot;station&quot; and &quot;channel&quot; are used interchangeably as programming lineups are mostly centrally planned from the networks&#x27; main offices, and since provincial/regional stations usually just relay the broadcast from their parent network&#x27;s flagship station (usually based in the Mega Manila area). As such, networks made up of VHF stations are sometimes informally referred to by their over-the-air channel number in the Mega Manila area (for example, Channel 4 or &quot;Kwatro&quot; for People&#x27;s Television Network, Channel 2 or &quot;Dos&quot; for ABS-CBN, Channel 9 or &quot;Nueve&quot; for Radio Philippines Network, Channel 7 or &quot;Siyete&quot; for GMA Network, Channel 13 or &quot;Trese&quot; for IBC and Channel 5 or &quot;Singko&quot; for TV5), while some incorporate their channel numbers in the network&#x27;s name (for example, TV5, Studio 23 and Net 25, which respectively broadcast on VHF channel 5, and UHF channels 23 and 25).

Unlike the United States, where networks receive programmes produced by various production companies, the two largest networks in the Philippines produce all of their prime time programmes. Other networks adopt block-time programming, which uses programming arrangements similar to the relationship between a U.S. network and station.

<text>Alkanna tinctoria, the dyer&#x27;s alkanet or simply alkanet, is a herbaceous flowering plant in the borage family Boraginaceae. Its roots are used to produce a red dye. The plant is also known as dyers&#x27; bugloss, orchanet, Spanish bugloss, or Languedoc bugloss. It is native to the Mediterranean region. &quot;A. tinctoria&quot; has 30 chromosomes and is regarded as a dysploid at the tetraploid level (4x + 2).

&quot;A. tinctoria&quot; has a bright blue flower. The plant has a root of blackish appearance externally, but blue-red inside, with a whitish core. The root produces a fine red colouring material, which has been used as a dye in the Mediterranean region since antiquity. The dyestuff in its roots is soluble in alcohol, ether, and oils, but is insoluble in water. It is used to give colour to wines and alcoholic tinctures, to vegetable oils, and to varnishes.

Powdered and mixed with oil, the alkanet root is used as a wood stain. When mixed into an oily environment, it imparts a crimson color to the oil, which when applied to wood moves the wood&#x27;s color towards dark-red-brown (resembling that of rosewood), and accentuates the grain of the wood.

Alkanet is also traditionally used in Indian food under the name &quot;ratan jot&quot;, and lends its red colour to some versions of the curry dish &quot;rogan josh&quot;. In Australia, alkanet is approved for use as a food colouring, but in the European Union, it is not.

It has been used as colorant for lipstick and rouge.

In alkaline environments, alkanet dye is blue; in the presence of acids it gradually changes to crimson. The colour is red at pH 6.1, purple at 8.8 and blue at pH 10. 

The colouring agent in &quot;A. tinctoria&quot; root has been chemically isolated and named alkannin.

In folk medicine, it is also used to treat abscesses and inflammations.

In English in the late medieval era, the name alkanet meant &quot;A. tinctoria&quot;. In the centuries since then, the name has come to be used informally for some botanically related other plants; see Alkanet.

<text>In mathematics and physics, Laplace&#x27;s equation is a second-order partial differential equation named after Pierre-Simon Laplace, who first studied its properties. This is often written as
formula_1 or formula_2
where formula_3 is the Laplace operator, formula_4 is the divergence operator (also symbolized &quot;div&quot;), formula_5 is the gradient operator (also symbolized &quot;grad&quot;), and formula_6 is a twice-differentiable real-valued function. The Laplace operator therefore maps a scalar function to another scalar function.

If the right-hand side is specified as a given function, formula_7, we have
formula_8

This is called Poisson&#x27;s equation, a generalization of Laplace&#x27;s equation. Laplace&#x27;s equation and Poisson&#x27;s equation are the simplest examples of elliptic partial differential equations. Laplace&#x27;s equation is also a special case of the Helmholtz equation.

The general theory of solutions to Laplace&#x27;s equation is known as potential theory. The twice continuously differentiable solutions of Laplace&#x27;s equation are the harmonic functions, which are important in multiple branches of physics, notably electrostatics, gravitation, and fluid dynamics. In the study of heat conduction, the Laplace equation is the steady-state heat equation. In general, Laplace&#x27;s equation describes situations of equilibrium, or those that do not depend explicitly on time.

==Forms in different coordinate systems==
In rectangular coordinates,
formula_9

In cylindrical coordinates,
formula_10

In spherical coordinates, using the formula_11 convention,
formula_12

More generally, in arbitrary curvilinear coordinates ,
formula_13
or 
formula_14
where is the Euclidean metric tensor relative to the new coordinates and denotes its Christoffel symbols.

==Boundary conditions==
The Dirichlet problem for Laplace&#x27;s equation consists of finding a solution on some domain such that on the boundary of is equal to some given function. Since the Laplace operator appears in the heat equation, one physical interpretation of this problem is as follows: fix the temperature on the boundary of the domain according to the given specification of the boundary condition. Allow heat to flow until a stationary state is reached in which the temperature at each point on the domain does not change anymore. The temperature distribution in the interior will then be given by the solution to the corresponding Dirichlet problem.

The Neumann boundary conditions for Laplace&#x27;s equation specify not the function itself on the boundary of but its normal derivative. Physically, this corresponds to the construction of a potential for a vector field whose effect is known at the boundary of alone. For the example of the heat equation it amounts to prescribing the heat flux through the boundary. In particular, at an adiabatic boundary, the normal derivative of is zero.

Solutions of Laplace&#x27;s equation are called harmonic functions; they are all analytic within the domain where the equation is satisfied. If any two functions are solutions to Laplace&#x27;s equation (or any linear homogeneous differential equation), their sum (or any linear combination) is also a solution. This property, called the principle of superposition, is very useful. For example, solutions to complex problems can be constructed by summing simple solutions.

==In two dimensions==
Laplace&#x27;s equation in two independent variables in rectangular coordinates has the form 
formula_15
===Analytic functions===

The real and imaginary parts of a complex analytic function both satisfy the Laplace equation. That is, if , and if 
formula_16
then the necessary condition that be analytic is that and be differentiable and that the Cauchy–Riemann equations be satisfied:
formula_17
where is the first partial derivative of with respect to .
It follows that 
formula_18
Therefore satisfies the Laplace equation. A similar calculation shows that also satisfies the Laplace equation. 
Conversely, given a harmonic function, it is the real part of an analytic function, (at least locally). If a trial form is
formula_19
then the Cauchy–Riemann equations will be satisfied if we set
formula_20
This relation does not determine , but only its increments:
formula_21
The Laplace equation for implies that the integrability condition for is satisfied:
formula_22
and thus may be defined by a line integral. The integrability condition and Stokes&#x27; theorem implies that the value of the line integral connecting two points is independent of the path. The resulting pair of solutions of the Laplace equation are called conjugate harmonic functions. This construction is only valid locally, or provided that the path does not loop around a singularity. For example, if and are polar coordinates and
formula_23
then a corresponding analytic function is
formula_24

However, the angle is single-valued only in a region that does not enclose the origin.

The close connection between the Laplace equation and analytic functions implies that any solution of the Laplace equation has derivatives of all orders, and can be expanded in a power series, at least inside a circle that does not enclose a singularity. This is in sharp contrast to solutions of the wave equation, which generally have less regularity.

There is an intimate connection between power series and Fourier series. If we expand a function in a power series inside a circle of radius , this means that
formula_25
with suitably defined coefficients whose real and imaginary parts are given by 
formula_26
Therefore
formula_27
which is a Fourier series for . These trigonometric functions can themselves be expanded, using multiple angle formulae.

===Fluid flow===

Let the quantities and be the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity field of a steady incompressible, irrotational flow in two dimensions. The continuity condition for an incompressible flow is that 
formula_28
and the condition that the flow be irrotational is that
formula_29
If we define the differential of a function by
formula_30
then the continuity condition is the integrability condition for this differential: the resulting function is called the stream function because it is constant along flow lines. The first derivatives of are given by
formula_31
and the irrotationality condition implies that satisfies the Laplace equation. The harmonic function that is conjugate to is called the velocity potential. The Cauchy–Riemann equations imply that
formula_32
Thus every analytic function corresponds to a steady incompressible, irrotational, inviscid fluid flow in the plane. The real part is the velocity potential, and the imaginary part is the stream function.

===Electrostatics===
According to Maxwell&#x27;s equations, an electric field in two space dimensions that is independent of time satisfies
formula_33
and
formula_34
where is the charge density. The first Maxwell equation is the integrability condition for the differential
formula_35
so the electric potential may be constructed to satisfy
formula_36
The second of Maxwell&#x27;s equations then implies that 
formula_37
which is the Poisson equation. The Laplace equation can be used in three-dimensional problems in electrostatics and fluid flow just as in two dimensions.

==In three dimensions==

===Fundamental solution===
A fundamental solution of Laplace&#x27;s equation satisfies
formula_38
where the Dirac delta function denotes a unit source concentrated at the point . No function has this property: in fact it is a distribution rather than a function; but it can be thought of as a limit of functions whose integrals over space are unity, and whose support (the region where the function is non-zero) shrinks to a point (see weak solution). It is common to take a different sign convention for this equation than one typically does when defining fundamental solutions. This choice of sign is often convenient to work with because −Δ is a positive operator. The definition of the fundamental solution thus implies that, if the Laplacian of is integrated over any volume that encloses the source point, then
formula_39

The Laplace equation is unchanged under a rotation of coordinates, and hence we can expect that a fundamental solution may be obtained among solutions that only depend upon the distance from the source point. If we choose the volume to be a ball of radius around the source point, then Gauss&#x27;s divergence theorem implies that
formula_40

It follows that 
formula_41
on a sphere of radius that is centered on the source point, and hence
formula_42

Note that, with the opposite sign convention (used in physics), this is the potential generated by a point particle, for an inverse-square law force, arising in the solution of Poisson equation. A similar argument shows that in two dimensions
formula_43
where denotes the natural logarithm. Note that, with the opposite sign convention, this is the potential generated by a pointlike sink (see point particle), which is the solution of the Euler equations in two-dimensional incompressible flow.

===Green&#x27;s function===
A Green&#x27;s function is a fundamental solution that also satisfies a suitable condition on the boundary of a volume . For instance, 
formula_44
may satisfy
formula_45 
formula_46

Now if is any solution of the Poisson equation in :
formula_47

and assumes the boundary values on , then we may apply Green&#x27;s identity, (a consequence of the divergence theorem) which states that

formula_48

The notations &quot;un&quot; and &quot;Gn&quot; denote normal derivatives on . In view of the conditions satisfied by and , this result simplifies to

formula_49

Thus the Green&#x27;s function describes the influence at of the data and . For the case of the interior of a sphere of radius , the Green&#x27;s function may be obtained by means of a reflection : the source point at distance from the center of the sphere is reflected along its radial line to a point &quot;P&quot;&#x27; that is at a distance

formula_50

Note that if is inside the sphere, then &quot;P′&quot; will be outside the sphere. The Green&#x27;s function is then given by
formula_51
where denotes the distance to the source point and denotes the distance to the reflected point &quot;P&quot;′. A consequence of this expression for the Green&#x27;s function is the Poisson integral formula. Let , , and be spherical coordinates for the source point . Here denotes the angle with the vertical axis, which is contrary to the usual American mathematical notation, but agrees with standard European and physical practice. Then the solution of the Laplace equation with Dirichlet boundary values inside the sphere is given by 
formula_52 
where
formula_53
is the cosine of the angle between and . A simple consequence of this formula is that if is a harmonic function, then the value of at the center of the sphere is the mean value of its values on the sphere. This mean value property immediately implies that a non-constant harmonic function cannot assume its maximum value at an interior point.

=== Laplace&#x27;s spherical harmonics ===
Laplace&#x27;s equation in spherical coordinates is:

formula_54

Consider the problem of finding solutions of the form . By separation of variables, two differential equations result by imposing Laplace&#x27;s equation:

formula_55

The second equation can be simplified under the assumption that has the form . Applying separation of variables again to the second equation gives way to the pair of differential equations

formula_56
formula_57

for some number . A priori, is a complex constant, but because must be a periodic function whose period evenly divides , is necessarily an integer and is a linear combination of the complex exponentials . The solution function is regular at the poles of the sphere, where . Imposing this regularity in the solution of the second equation at the boundary points of the domain is a Sturm–Liouville problem that forces the parameter to be of the form for some non-negative integer with ; this is also explained below in terms of the orbital angular momentum. Furthermore, a change of variables transforms this equation into the Legendre equation, whose solution is a multiple of the associated Legendre polynomial . Finally, the equation for has solutions of the form ; requiring the solution to be regular throughout forces .

Here the solution was assumed to have the special form . For a given value of , there are independent solutions of this form, one for each integer with . These angular solutions are a product of trigonometric functions, here represented as a complex exponential, and associated Legendre polynomials:
formula_58
which fulfill
formula_59

Here is called a spherical harmonic function of degree and order , is an associated Legendre polynomial, is a normalization constant, and and represent colatitude and longitude, respectively. In particular, the colatitude , or polar angle, ranges from at the North Pole, to at the Equator, to at the South Pole, and the longitude , or azimuth, may assume all values with . For a fixed integer , every solution of the eigenvalue problem
formula_60
is a linear combination of . In fact, for any such solution, is the expression in spherical coordinates of a homogeneous polynomial that is harmonic (see below), and so counting dimensions shows that there are linearly independent such polynomials.

The general solution to Laplace&#x27;s equation in a ball centered at the origin is a linear combination of the spherical harmonic functions multiplied by the appropriate scale factor ,
formula_61
where the are constants and the factors are known as solid harmonics. Such an expansion is valid in the ball
formula_62

For formula_63, the solid harmonics with negative powers of formula_64 are chosen instead. In that case, one needs to expand the solution of known regions in Laurent series (about formula_65), instead of Taylor series (about formula_66), to match the terms and find formula_67.

===Electrostatics and magnetostatics===
Let formula_68 be the electric field, formula_69 be the electric charge density, and formula_70 be the permittivity of free space. Then Gauss&#x27;s law for electricity (Maxwell&#x27;s first equation) in differential form states
formula_71

Now, the electric field can be expressed as the negative gradient of the electric potential formula_72,
formula_73
if the field is irrotational, formula_74. The irrotationality of formula_68 is also known as the electrostatic condition.

formula_76
formula_77

Plugging this relation into Gauss&#x27;s law, we obtain Poisson&#x27;s equation for electricity,
formula_78

In the particular case of a source-free region, formula_79 and Poisson&#x27;s equation reduces to Laplace&#x27;s equation for the electric potential.

If the electrostatic potential formula_72 is specified on the boundary of a region formula_81, then it is uniquely determined. If formula_81 is surrounded by a conducting material with a specified charge density formula_69, and if the total charge formula_84 is known, then formula_72 is also unique.

For the magnetic field, when there is no free current, formula_86We can thus define a magnetic scalar potential, , as 
formula_87With the definition of :
formula_88
it follows that
formula_89

Similar to electrostatics, in a source-free region, formula_90 and Poisson&#x27;s equation reduces to Laplace&#x27;s equation for the magnetic scalar potential ,
formula_91

A potential that does not satisfy Laplace&#x27;s equation together with the boundary condition is an invalid electrostatic or magnetic scalar potential.

==Gravitation==
Let formula_92 be the gravitational field, formula_69 the mass density, and formula_94 the gravitational constant. Then Gauss&#x27;s law for gravitation in differential form is
formula_95

The gravitational field is conservative and can therefore be expressed as the negative gradient of the gravitational potential:
formula_96

Using the differential form of Gauss&#x27;s law of gravitation, we have
formula_97
which is Poisson&#x27;s equation for gravitational fields.

In empty space, formula_98 and we have
formula_99
which is Laplace&#x27;s equation for gravitational fields.

==In the Schwarzschild metric==

S. Persides solved the Laplace equation in Schwarzschild spacetime on hypersurfaces of constant . Using the canonical variables , , the solution is
formula_100
where is a spherical harmonic function, and
formula_101

Here and are Legendre functions of the first and second kind, respectively, while is the Schwarzschild radius. The parameter is an arbitrary non-negative integer.

<text>Christopher John Reuel Tolkien (21 November 1924 – 16 January 2020) was an English and naturalised French academic editor and writer. The son of the author and academic J. R. R. Tolkien, Christopher edited 24 volumes based on his father&#x27;s posthumously published work, including &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; and the 12-volume series &quot;The History of Middle-Earth&quot;, a task that took 45 years. He also drew the original maps for his father&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

Outside his father&#x27;s unfinished works, Christopher edited three tales by Geoffrey Chaucer (with Nevill Coghill) and his father&#x27;s translation of &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;. Tolkien scholars have remarked that he used his skill as a philologist, demonstrated in his editing of those medieval works, to research, collate, edit, and comment on his father&#x27;s Middle-earth writings exactly as if they were real-world legends. The effect is both to frame his father&#x27;s works and to insert himself as a narrator. They have further noted that his additions to &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, such as to fill in gaps, and his composition of the text in his own literary style, place him as an author as well as an editor of that book.

== Early life and education ==

Christopher Tolkien was born on 21 November 1924 in Leeds, England, the third of four children and the youngest son of J. R. R. and Edith Tolkien (&quot;née&quot; Bratt). He was educated at the Dragon School in Oxford, and later at the Roman Catholic Oratory School near Reading.

He won a place to study English at Trinity College, Oxford, still aged 17, but after a year and a half there he received his call-up papers for military service. He joined the Royal Air Force in July 1943 and at the start of 1944 was sent to South Africa for flight training. He gained his &quot;wings&quot; as a fighter pilot and was commissioned in January 1945. He was given a posting back in England in February 1945, at Market Drayton in Shropshire. In June 1945 he switched to the Fleet Air Arm. While still in the service, he resumed his degree in April 1946; he was demobilised at the end of that year. He took his B.A. in 1948, and his B.Litt. in 1953 under the philologist Gabriel Turville-Petre.

== Career ==

Tolkien was for a long time part of the critical audience for his father&#x27;s fiction, first as a child listening to tales of Bilbo Baggins (published as &quot;The Hobbit&quot;), and then as a teenager and young adult offering feedback on &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; throughout its 15-year gestation. He also redrew his father&#x27;s working maps for inclusion in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. His father invited him to join the Inklings, a literary discussion group, when Christopher was 21 years old. His father called this &quot;a quite unprecedented honour&quot;. He became a lecturer in English language at St Catherine&#x27;s Society, Oxford in 1954.

Away from his father&#x27;s writings, he published &quot;The Saga of King Heidrek the Wise&quot;: &quot;Translated from the Icelandic with Introduction, Notes and Appendices by Christopher Tolkien&quot; in 1960. Later, he followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps, becoming a lecturer and tutor in English language at New College, Oxford in 1963. 

In 1967 his father named him as his literary executor, and more specifically as his co-author of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. After his father&#x27;s death in 1973, he took a large quantity of legendarium manuscripts to his Oxfordshire home, where he converted a barn into a workspace. He and the young Guy Gavriel Kay started work on the documents, discovering by 1975 how complex the task was likely to be. In September 1975 he resigned from New College to work exclusively on editing his father&#x27;s writings. He moved to France and continued this task for 45 years. In all, he edited and published 24 volumes of his father&#x27;s writings, most of them to do with the Middle-earth legendarium.

In 2016 Christopher won a Bodley Medal, an award that recognises outstanding contributions to literature, culture, science, and communication.

He served as chairman of the Tolkien Estate, the entity formed to handle the business side of his father&#x27;s literary legacy, and as a trustee of the Tolkien Charitable Trust. He resigned as director of the estate in 2017.

== Editorial work ==

=== The challenge of the legendarium ===

Tolkien wrote a great deal of material in the Middle-earth legendarium that remained unpublished in his lifetime. He had originally intended to publish &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; alongside &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in the 1950s, but it was rejected by his publisher. Parts of it were in a finished state when he died in 1973, but the project was incomplete. He once called his son his &quot;chief critic and collaborator&quot;, and named him his literary executor. Christopher organised the masses of his father&#x27;s unpublished writings, some of them written on odd scraps of paper half a century earlier. Much of the material was handwritten; frequently a fair draft was written over a half-erased first draft, and names of characters routinely changed between the beginning and the end of the same draft. He explained:

=== From &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; to &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot; ===

Christopher and Kay produced a single-volume edition of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; for publication in 1977. Its success led to the publication of &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot; in 1980, and then to the far larger project of &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot; in 12 volumes between 1983 and 1996. Most of the original source-texts that Christopher used to construct &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; were published in this way. Charles Noad comments that the 12-volume &quot;History&quot; had done something that a putative single-volume edition of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; with embedded commentary could not have achieved: it had changed people&#x27;s perspective on Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth writings, from being centred on &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; to what it had always been in Tolkien&#x27;s mind: &quot;Silmarillion&quot;-centred. Noad adds that &quot;The whole series of &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot; is a tremendous achievement and makes a worthy and enduring testament to one man&#x27;s creative endeavours and to another&#x27;s explicatory devotion. It reveals far more about Tolkien&#x27;s invented world than any of his readers in pre-&quot;Silmarillion&quot; days could ever have imagined or hoped for.&quot;

=== &quot;Great Tales&quot; of the &quot;Elder Days&quot; ===

In April 2007, he published &quot;The Children of Húrin&quot;, whose story his father had brought to a relatively complete stage between 1951 and 1957, but then abandoned. This was one of his father&#x27;s earliest stories, its first version dating back to 1918; several versions are published in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot;, and &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot;. &quot;The Children of Húrin&quot; is a synthesis of these and other sources. It, along with &quot;Beren and Lúthien&quot;, published in 2017, and &quot;The Fall of Gondolin&quot;, published in 2018, constituted what J. R. R. Tolkien called the three &quot;Great Tales&quot; of the &quot;Elder Days&quot;.

=== Medieval works ===

Christopher edited some works by his father that were unconnected to the Middle-earth legendarium. &quot;The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún&quot; appeared in May 2009, a verse retelling of the Norse Völsung cycle, followed by &quot;The Fall of Arthur&quot; in May 2013, and by &quot;&quot; in May 2014.

== Opinions ==

=== Editor or author ===

Vincent Ferré comments that early in the process of editing his father&#x27;s unpublished writings, &quot;the real nature of Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s work was a matter of debate, before a more simplistic consensus began to prevail.&quot; Christopher Tolkien explained in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; foreword in 1977 &quot;I set myself therefore to work out a single text, selecting and arranging in such a way as seemed to me to produce the most coherent and internally self-consistent narrative.&quot; In Ferré&#x27;s opinion, &quot;This choice remains one of his [most] distinctive marks on the book&quot;, noting that J. R. R. Tolkien had foreseen in a 1963 letter that the presentation of the stories &quot;will need a lot of work ... the legends have to be worked over ... and made consistent ... and they have to be given some progressive shape.&quot;

In 1981, the scholar of literature Randel Helms, taking that statement as definitive of Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s editorial, indeed authorial, intentions: stated in terms that &quot;&quot;The Silmarillion&quot; in the shape that we have it [a single-volume narrative] is the invention of the son not the father&quot;. 

Christopher Tolkien disagreed, stating in the foreword to the 1983 &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot;, that the outcome of his work had been &quot;to add a further dimension of obscurity to &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, ... about the age of the work ... and about the degree of editorial intrusion and manipulation (or even invention), is a stumbling-block and a source of much misapprehension.&quot; In the same foreword, while rebuffing Helms but without explaining why Helms&#x27;s opinion was wrong, Christopher Tolkien admitted that the wisdom of publishing &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; with (unlike &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;) no frame story, &quot;no suggestion of what it is and how (within the imagined world) it came to be&quot;, was &quot;certainly debatable&quot;. He added &quot;This I now think to have been an error.&quot; He noted, too, that the philologist and Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey, in his book &quot;The Road to Middle-earth&quot;, was &quot;clearly reluctant to see [&quot;The Silmarillion&quot;] as other than a &#x27;late&#x27; work, even the latest work of its author&quot;, i.e. that its text owes as much to Christopher Tolkien as to his father.

Ferré records that, much later, in 2012, Christopher Tolkien admitted &quot;I had had to invent some passages&quot;, that he had had a dream that his father was anxiously searching for something, and that he had &quot;realized in horror that it was &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;.&quot; In Ferré&#x27;s view, he should be thought of as &quot;a writer in his own right, and not only as an &#x27;editor&#x27; of his father&#x27;s manuscripts&quot;. He gives two reasons for this: that &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; reveals his own writing style and &quot;the choices he made in &#x27;constructing&#x27;&quot; the narrative; and that he had to devise parts of the story, both to fill gaps and when &quot;threads were impossible to weave together&quot;.

Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s editing of the 12 volumes of &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot;, using his skill as a philologist, created an editorial frame for his father&#x27;s legendarium, and for the books derived from it. Ferré comments that this presented his father&#x27;s writings as historical, a real set of legends from the past, in just the same way that his editing of &quot;The Monsters and the Critics, and Other Essays&quot; presented his father&#x27;s essays as scholarly work.

=== Reaction to filmed versions ===

In 2001 Christopher Tolkien expressed doubts over &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, questioning the viability of a film interpretation that retained the essence of the work, but stressed that this was just his opinion. In a 2012 interview with &quot;Le Monde,&quot; he criticised the films, saying: &quot;They gutted the book, making an action film for 15 to 25-year-olds.&quot; In 2008 he commenced legal proceedings against New Line Cinema, which he claimed owed his family £80 million in unpaid royalties. In September 2009, he and New Line reached an undisclosed settlement, and he withdrew his legal objection to &quot;The Hobbit&quot; films.

== Personal life ==
Tolkien was married twice. He had two sons and one daughter. His first marriage in 1951 was to the sculptor Faith Lucy Tilly Faulconbridge (1928–2017). They separated in 1964, and divorced in 1967. Her work is featured in the National Portrait Gallery. Their son Simon Mario Reuel Tolkien is a barrister and novelist.

He married Baillie Klass in 1967; they had two children, Adam and Rachel. In 1975 they moved to the south of France, where she edited her father-in-law&#x27;s &quot;The Father Christmas Letters&quot; for posthumous publication.

In the wake of a dispute surrounding the making of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, he is said to have disapproved of the views of his son Simon. He felt that &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; was &quot;peculiarly unsuitable for transformation into visual dramatic form&quot;, whilst his son became involved as an advisor with the series. They later reconciled, and Simon dedicated one of his novels to his father.

Tolkien died on 16 January 2020, at the age of 95, in Draguignan, Var, France.

<doc id="36947" wikidata="Q708399" url="?curid=36947" title="Indemnity">
<text>In contract law, an indemnity is a contractual obligation of one party (the &quot;indemnitor&quot;) to compensate the loss incurred by another party (the &quot;indemnitee&quot;) due to the relevant acts of the indemnitor or any other party. The duty to indemnify is usually, but not always, coextensive with the contractual duty to &quot;hold harmless&quot; or &quot;save harmless&quot;. In contrast, a &quot;guarantee&quot; is an obligation of one party (the &quot;guarantor&quot;) to another party to perform the promise of a relevant other party if that other party defaults.

Indemnities form the basis of many insurance contracts; for example, a car owner may purchase different kinds of insurance as an indemnity for various kinds of loss arising from operation of the car, such as damage to the car itself, or medical expenses following an accident. In an agency context, a principal may be obligated to indemnify their agent for liabilities incurred while carrying out responsibilities under the relationship. While the events giving rise to an indemnity may be specified by contract, the actions that must be taken to compensate the injured party are largely unpredictable, and the maximum compensation is often expressly limited.

==English common law==


===Indemnity clauses===

Under section 4 of the Statute of Frauds (1677), a &quot;guarantee&quot; (an undertaking of secondary liability; to answer for another&#x27;s default) must be evidenced in writing. No such formal requirement exists in respect of indemnities (involving the assumption of primary liability; to pay irrespective of another&#x27;s default) which are enforceable even if made orally.

Under current English law, indemnities must be clearly and precisely worded in the contract in order to be enforceable. The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 stated that a consumer cannot be made to unreasonably indemnify another for their breach of contract or negligence, though this section was repealed by the Consumer Rights Act 2015 schedule 4 paragraph 6.

===Contract award===
In England and Wales an &quot;indemnity&quot; monetary award may form part of rescission during an action of restitutio in integrum. The property and funds are exchanged, but indemnity may be granted for costs necessarily incurred to the innocent party pursuant to the contract. The leading case is &quot;Whittington v Seale-Hayne&quot;, in which a contaminated farm was sold. The contract made the buyers renovate the real estate and, the contamination incurred medical expenses for their manager, who had fallen ill. Once the contract was rescinded, the buyer could be indemnified for the cost of renovation as this was necessary to the contract, but not the medical expenses as the contract did not require them to hire a manager. Were the sellers at fault, damages would clearly be available.

The distinction between indemnity and damages is subtle and may be differentiated by considering the roots of the law of obligations: how can money be paid if the defendant is not at fault? The contract before rescission is voidable but not void, so, for a period of time, there is a legal contract. During that time, both parties have legal obligation. If the contract is to be voided &quot;ab initio&quot; the obligations performed must also be compensated. Therefore, the costs of indemnity arise from the (transient and performed) obligations of the claimant rather than a breach of obligation by the defendant.

===Distinction from guarantees===
An indemnity is distinct from a guarantee, which is the promise of a third party to honor the obligation of a party to a contract should that party be unable or unwilling to do so (usually a guarantee is limited to an obligation to pay a debt). This distinction between indemnity and guarantee was discussed as early as the eighteenth century in &quot;Birkmyr v Darnell&quot;. In that case, concerned with a guarantee of payment for goods rather than payment of rent, the presiding judge explained that a guarantee effectively says &quot;Let him have the goods; if he does not pay you, I will.&quot;

===Distinction from warranties===
An indemnity is distinct from a warranty in that:
* An indemnity guarantees compensation equal to the amount of loss subject to the indemnity, while a warranty only guarantees compensation for the reduction in value of the acquired asset due to the warranted fact being untrue (and the beneficiary must prove such diminution in value).
* Warranties require the beneficiary to mitigate their losses, while indemnities do not.
* Warranties do not cover problems known to the beneficiary at the time the warranty is given, while indemnities do.

==United States contracts==
Many private contracts and terms of service in the United States require one party (indemnitor, typically a customer) to pay (indemnify) the other side&#x27;s costs for legal claims arising from the relationship. They are particularly common in online services.

The US government publishes special Terms of Service, which it has negotiated with many companies, to exclude indemnification for official US government work. US law &quot;is violated by any indemnification agreement that, without statutory authorization, imposes on the United States an open-ended, potentially unrestricted liability.&quot;
 The Attorney General says federal agencies &quot;should renegotiate the terms of service to revise or eliminate the indemnification clause or cancel the [government]&#x27;s enrollments in social media applications when their operators insist on such a clause.&quot;

===State variations===
Under US law, interpretation of indemnification clauses varies by state. For example, in California indemnification clauses do not cover certain risks unless the risks are listed in the contract, but in New York, the brief clause, &quot;X shall defend and indemnify Y for all claims arising from the Product&quot; makes X responsible for all claims against Y. Indemnity can be extremely costly since X&#x27;s liability insurance typically does not cover claims against Y, but X still has to cover them.

In 2017, the Utah Supreme Court stated, &quot;By statute, a contractual provision requiring a purchaser of a product to indemnify a manufacturer is &#x27;void and unenforceable&#x27; in certain circumstances. Utah Code § 78B-6-707.&quot;

In 2012–2014, a New Jersey woman had to pay a lawyer to get out of an indemnity payment for injury at a storage unit. When someone slipped on ice in 2012 while going to a unit, Public Storage sued in court to make the woman who rented the unit pay for the injury. She tried to ignore the case and so state court ruled that she had to pay. She then retained a lawyer and went to court. In 2014, the US District Court decided that the specific indemnity clause was unenforceable in New Jersey because it covered Public Storage&#x27;s own negligence without explicitly saying so, contrary to New Jersey law (other states differ).
A 2013 decision in New Jersey upheld a broad indemnity clause since it was followed by another sentence: &quot;indemnity agreement is intended to be as broad and inclusive as is permitted by the law of the State of New Jersey.&quot; The judge said, &quot;It is true that a consumer, unfamiliar with the laws of New Jersey, would not be able to state with certainty how far the waiver extends.&quot;

In 2010, the Colorado Supreme Court required a flower shop to indemnify its shopping center for a customer who slipped on the icy parking lot, though of no fault of the flower shop, because the tenant was there to visit that shop, and the shop&#x27;s lease had a broad indemnity clause.

In 1999, the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming did not require a customer to indemnify a whitewater rafting company for injury to his wife since the wording may have applied only to him and his children, and clauses cannot be enforced in Wyoming to indemnify a company for its own negligence.

In 1979, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that a subcontractor must indemnify the builder for damages that it caused, according to an indemnification clause in their purchase order.

In 1966, the Supreme Court of California ruled that The Hertz Corporation could not enforce its clause requiring renters to indemnify Hertz&#x27;s insurer.

===With negotiations===
Indemnities can be expensive enough to bankrupt a company that pays them: &quot;If manufacturers ... are to survive, they will need liability insurance, as well as favorable contracts with retailers. If you look at a big retailers, such as Trader Joe&#x27;s or Costco or Walmart or Randalls, very often there will be an indemnity provision providing that, if you want to sell a product in our stores, and if it gets someone sick or if it has to be recalled, and it&#x27;s your fault, you must pay us back for that.&quot;

When a contract is &quot;negotiable,&quot; the indemnitor negotiates to control those legal costs. It will not let the indemnified party (indemnitee) overspend: &quot;An arrangement in which the indemnitee makes decisions about how to defend and settle the claim while the indemnitor writes the checks presents a moral hazard. Knowing that its defense and settlement costs are being borne by the indemnitor, the indemnitee may be encouraged to engage a more expensive legal team or pursue a riskier defense strategy than it would otherwise. For this reason, most indemnitors are unwilling to indemnify against claims when they do not control the defense of the claim.&quot;

The American Bar Association has published advice on negotiations of construction contracts: that (1) owners try to get contractors to indemnify as much as possible and for (2) contractors (a) indemnify only for their own negligence and (b) &quot;establish a right but not a duty for the contractor to defend under an indemnification claim.&quot;

An example of letting the indemnitor control costs is in the case of a contractor for a homeowners&#x27; association (HOA) in which &quot;Contractor shall indemnify, defend (by counsel reasonably acceptable to Association) and hold harmless the Association.&quot; Companies and HOAs also use indemnity to protect directors since few would serve as directors if their risks were not indemnified. Negotiation is important for both parties. &quot;Just about all homeowner association management contracts have a provision which states that the HOA shall indemnify the manager under certain circumstances ... There are several ways the indemnification clause can be drafted and both management and HOA must take into account what protects each the best.&quot;

If indemnitors can negotiate a limit on liability in their contract, that limits the cost of a potential indemnity if they &quot;make clear in the agreement that any limitations of liability (whether in the form of caps or exclusions of certain types of damages e.g., consequential) apply to the ... indemnification.&quot;

===Without negotiations===
When a contract is negotiable (adhesion contract), the wording often lets the indemnitee decide what to spend on legal costs and bill the indemnitor. Most clauses are quite broad. The following are examples of indemnity requirements from a range of businesses. The last one, Angie&#x27;s List, limits issues to the user&#x27;s fault, but decisions and costs are still controlled by the indemnitee (Angie&#x27;s List).
* &quot;The yacht owner shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the marina from any costs, expenses, damages, and against all claims, demands, loss, lawsuits, including judgments and attorney fees for damages to property, injury or life to third parties resulting or arising from the yacht owner&#x27;s use of the yacht.&quot; The lawyer for a boat owners&#x27; group interpreted that as meaning: &quot;By signing a marina contract with such provisions, you may find yourself responsible for costs not covered by your insurance policy ... What it means is that if your guest is injured at the marina, even if it&#x27;s the marina&#x27;s fault, you agree that you will defend the marina against the claim and pay any damages for which the marina is deemed responsible.&quot;
* &quot;You agree to indemnify and hold Uber ... harmless from any and all claims ... in connection with: (i) your use of the Services ...&quot;
* &quot;Occupant shall indemnify and hold Owner [Public Storage] and Owner&#x27;s Agents harmless from any loss incurred by Owner and Owner&#x27;s Agents in any way arising out of Occupant&#x27;s use of the Premises or the Property including, but not limited to, claims of injury or loss by Occupant&#x27;s visitors or invitees.&quot;
* &quot;You agree to defend, hold harmless and indemnify edX [founded by Harvard and MIT] ... against any third-party claims ... in any way related to your use of the Site ...&quot;
* &quot;You agree that you will indemnify and hold harmless NPR ... from any and all claims ... arising from ... (2) your use of the NPR Services, (3) the User Materials you have Submitted on or through the NPR Services, or (4) NPR&#x27;s publication, distribution or use of such User Materials ...&quot;
* &quot;If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify Google ... from any claim, action or proceedings arising from or related to the use of the Services ...&quot;
* &quot;Upon request by Bank of America or its Affiliates, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Bank of America ... from all liabilities, claims and expenses, including attorneys fees, that arise from ... third party claims arising from your use of the Sites. Bank of America and its Affiliates reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you are not required to indemnify Bank of America or its Affiliates for its own violations of applicable laws.&quot;
* &quot;You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Verizon Parties from and against all losses ... related to claims made by any third-party due to or arising out of (a) Submitted Material ... (b) your use of the Sites or Resources ... Verizon reserves the right to assume the defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate with Verizon in asserting any available defenses.&quot;
* &quot;You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Angie&#x27;s List ... against all losses ... arising from: (a) any violation of this Agreement by You; (b) the inaccurate or untruthful Content or other information provided by You to Angie&#x27;s List or that You submit, transmit or otherwise make available through the Service; or (c) any intentional or willful violation of any rights of another or harm You may have caused to another. Angie&#x27;s List will have sole control of the defense of any such damage or claim.&quot;

==Insurance==

Indemnity insurance compensates the beneficiaries of the policies for their actual economic losses, up to the limiting amount of the insurance policy. It generally requires the insured to prove the amount of its loss before it can recover. Recovery is limited to the amount of the provable loss even if the face amount of the policy is higher. This is in contrast to, for example, life insurance, where the amount of the beneficiary&#x27;s economic loss is irrelevant. The death of the person whose life is insured for reasons not excluded from the policy obligate the insurer to pay the entire policy amount to the beneficiary.

Most business interruption insurance policies contain an Extended Period of Indemnity Endorsement, which extends coverage beyond the time that it takes to physically restore the property. This provision covers additional expenses that allow the business to return to prosperity and help the business restore revenues to pre-loss levels.

== Indemnity agreement for board members ==
As part of the appointment of officers, the board will often approve indemnification agreements with the officer. Such agreements provide for indemnification of officers for personal liability for actions taken on behalf of the corporation. The board will also approve separate resolutions that approve indemnification for decisions made by directors. Indemnity agreements are included in the post-incorporation processes of companies.

==Historical examples==
===Freeing of slaves and indentured servants===
Slave owners were considered to have suffered a loss whenever their slaves were granted their freedom.

When the slaves of Zanzibar were freed in 1897, it was by compensation since the prevailing opinion was that the slave owners suffered the loss of an asset whenever a slave was freed.

In the 1860s in the United States, U.S. President Abraham Lincoln had requested many millions of dollars from Congress with which to compensate slave owners for the loss of their slaves. On 9 July 1868, Section IV of the Fourteenth Amendment dismissed all of the claims that slave owners had been injured by the freeing of the slaves.

In 1807–1808, in Prussia, statesman Baron Heinrich vom Stein introduced a series of reforms, the principal of which was the abolition of serfdom with indemnification to territorial lords.

Haiti was required to pay an indemnity of 150,000,000 francs to France in order to atone for the loss suffered by the French slave owners.

In Peru, Antonio Salinas y Castañeda (1810–1874), a wealthy Peruvian landowner and conservative politician, led the meeting of the main landowners of the country for an indemnity after slavery abolition and ruled the commission who promoted the immigration of Asians to replace former slaves as a workforce during Ramón Castilla government.

===Costs of war===
The nation that wins a war may insist on being paid compensations for the costs of the war, even after having been the instigator of the war. 
* Following the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895, the Treaty of Shimonoseki required that China pay Japan the sum of 200,000,000 taels.
* Following the massacres of foreigners during the Boxer Rebellion, the defeated Qing Empire were to pay 450 million taels of fine silver as indemnity over a course of 39 years to the eight nations involved. Under the exchange rates at the time, this was equal to 335 million US gold dollars or £67 million.

<text>Giuseppe Mazzini (, ; ; 22 June 1805 – 10 March 1872) was an Italian politician, journalist, and activist for the unification of Italy (Risorgimento) and spearhead of the Italian revolutionary movement. His efforts helped bring about the independent and unified Italy in place of the several separate states, many dominated by foreign powers, that existed until the 19th century. An Italian nationalist in the historical radical tradition and a proponent of a republicanism of social-democratic inspiration, Mazzini helped define the modern European movement for popular democracy in a republican state.

Mazzini&#x27;s thoughts had a very considerable influence on the Italian and European republican movements, in the Constitution of Italy, about Europeanism and more nuanced on many politicians of a later period, among them American president Woodrow Wilson, British prime minister David Lloyd George, Mahatma Gandhi, Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, and Indian independence activist Vinayak Damodar Savarkar.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Mazzini was born in Genoa, which had recently been annexed by the First French Empire. His father Giacomo Mazzini, originally from Chiavari, was a university professor who had adhered to Jacobin ideology, while his mother Maria Drago was renowned for her beauty and religious Jansenist fervour. From a very early age, Mazzini showed good learning qualities as well as a precocious interest in politics and literature. He was admitted to university at 14, graduating in law in 1826 and initially practised as a &quot;poor man&#x27;s lawyer&quot;. Mazzini also hoped to become a historical novelist or a dramatist and in the same year wrote his first essay, &quot;Dell&#x27;amor patrio di Dante&quot; (&quot;On Dante&#x27;s Patriotic Love&quot;), published in 1827. In 1828–1829, he collaborated with the Genoese newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Indicatore Genovese&quot; which was soon closed by the Piedmontese authorities. He then became one of the leading authors of &quot;L&#x27;Indicatore Livornese&quot;, published at Livorno by Francesco Domenico Guerrazzi, until this paper was closed down by the authorities.

In 1827, Mazzini travelled to Tuscany, where he became a member of the Carbonari, a secret association with political purposes. On 31 October of that year, he was arrested at Genoa and interned at Savona. In early 1831, he was released from prison, but confined to a small hamlet. He chose exile instead, moving to Geneva, Switzerland.

===Failed insurrections===
In 1831, Mazzini went to Marseille, where he became a popular figure among the Italian exiles. He was a frequent visitor to the apartment of Giuditta Bellerio Sidoli, a Modenese widow who became his lover. In August 1832 Giuditta Sidoli gave birth to a boy, almost certainly Mazzini&#x27;s son, whom she named Joseph Démosthène Adolpe Aristide after members of the family of Démosthène Ollivier, with whom Mazzini was staying. The Olliviers took care of the child in June 1833 when Giuditta and Mazzini left for Switzerland. The child died in February 1835.

Mazzini organized a new political society called Young Italy. It was a secret society formed to promote Italian unification: &quot;One, free, independent, republican nation.&quot; Mazzini believed that a popular uprising would create a unified Italy, and would touch off a European-wide revolutionary movement. The group&#x27;s motto was &quot;God and the People&quot;, and its basic principle was the unification of the several states and kingdoms of the peninsula into a single republic as the only true foundation of Italian liberty. The new nation had to be &quot;One, Independent, Free Republic&quot;.

Mazzini&#x27;s political activism met some success in Tuscany, Abruzzi, Sicily, Piedmont, and his native Liguria, especially among several military officers. Young Italy counted about 60,000 adherents in 1833, with branches in Genoa and other cities. In that year Mazzini first attempted insurrection, which would spread from Chambéry (then part of the Kingdom of Sardinia), Alessandria, Turin, and Genoa. However, the Savoy government discovered the plot before it could begin and many revolutionaries (including Vincenzo Gioberti) were arrested. The repression was ruthless: 12 participants were executed, while Mazzini&#x27;s best friend and director of the Genoese section of the &quot;Giovine Italia&quot;, Jacopo Ruffini, killed himself. Mazzini was tried in absentia and sentenced to death.

Despite this setback, whose victims later created numerous doubts and psychological strife in Mazzini, he organized another uprising for the following year. A group of Italian exiles were to enter Piedmont from Switzerland and spread the revolution there, while Giuseppe Garibaldi, who had recently joined Young Italy, was to do the same from Genoa. However, the Piedmontese troops easily crushed the new attempt. Denis Mack Smith writes:
In the spring of 1834, while at Bern, Mazzini and a dozen refugees from Italy, Poland, and Germany founded a new association with the grandiose name of Young Europe. Its basic, and equally grandiose idea, was that, as the French Revolution of 1789 had enlarged the concept of individual liberty, another revolution would now be needed for national liberty, and his vision went further because he hoped that in the no doubt distant future free nations might combine to form a loosely federal Europe with some kind of federal assembly to regulate their common interests. ... His intention was nothing less than to overturn the European settlement agreed in 1815 by the Congress of Vienna, which had reestablished an oppressive hegemony of a few great powers and blocked the emergence of smaller nations. ... Mazzini hoped, but without much confidence, that his vision of a league or society of independent nations would be realized in his own lifetime. In practice, Young Europe lacked the money and popular support for more than a short-term existence. Nevertheless, he always remained faithful to the ideal of a united continent for which the creation of individual nations would be an indispensable preliminary.

On 28 May 1834, Mazzini was arrested at Solothurn, and exiled from Switzerland. He moved to Paris, where he was again imprisoned on 5 July. He was released only after promising he would move to England. Mazzini, together with a few Italian friends, moved in January 1837 to live in London in very poor economic conditions.

===Exile in London===
On 30 April 1840, Mazzini reformed the &quot;Giovine Italia&quot; in London, and on 10 November of the same year, he began issuing the &quot;Apostolato popolare&quot; (&quot;Apostleship of the People&quot;).

A succession of failed attempts at promoting further uprisings in Sicily, Abruzzi, Tuscany, and Lombardy-Venetia discouraged Mazzini for a long period, which dragged on until 1840. He was also abandoned by Sidoli, who had returned to Italy to rejoin her children. The help of his mother pushed Mazzini to create several organizations aimed at the unification or liberation of other nations, in the wake of &quot;Giovine Italia&quot;: &quot;Young Germany&quot;, &quot;Young Poland&quot;, and &quot;Young Switzerland&quot;, which were under the aegis of &quot;Young Europe&quot; (&quot;Giovine Europa&quot;). He also created an Italian school for poor people active from 10 November 1841 at 5 Greville Street, London. From London he also wrote an endless series of letters to his agents in Europe and South America and made friends with Thomas Carlyle and his wife Jane. The &quot;Young Europe&quot; movement also inspired a group of young Turkish army cadets and students who, later in history, named themselves the &quot;Young Turks&quot;.

In 1843, he organized another riot in Bologna, which attracted the attention of two young officers of the Austrian Navy, Attilio and Emilio Bandiera. With Mazzini&#x27;s support, they landed near Cosenza (Kingdom of Naples) but were arrested and executed. Mazzini accused the British government of having passed information about the expeditions to the Neapolitans, and the question was raised in the British Parliament. When it was admitted that his private letters had indeed been opened, and its contents revealed by the Foreign Office to the Austrian and Neapolitan governments, Mazzini gained popularity and support among the British liberals, who were outraged by such a blatant intrusion of the government into his private correspondence.

In 1847, he moved again to London, where he wrote a long &quot;open letter&quot; to Pope Pius IX, whose apparently liberal reforms had gained him a momentary status as a possible paladin of the unification of Italy, but The Pope did not reply. He also founded the People&#x27;s International League. By 8 March 1848, Mazzini was in Paris, where he launched a new political association, the &quot;Associazione Nazionale Italiana&quot;. In apologising for not being able to attend the first annual celebration of the Leeds Redemption Society (a communitarian experiment) on 7 January 1847 he offered to become a subscriber.

===1848–1849 revolts===
On 7 April 1848, Mazzini reached Milan, whose population had rebelled against the Austrian garrison and established a provisional government. The First Italian War of Independence, started by the Piedmontese king Charles Albert to exploit the favourable circumstances in Milan, turned into a total failure. Mazzini, who had never been popular in the city because he wanted Lombardy to become a republic instead of joining Piedmont, abandoned Milan. He joined Garibaldi&#x27;s irregular force at Bergamo, moving to Switzerland with him. Mazzini was one of the founders and leaders of the Action Party, the first organized party in the history of Italy.

On 9 February 1849, a republic was declared in Rome, with Pius IX already having been forced to flee to Gaeta the preceding November. On the same day the Republic was declared, Mazzini reached the city. He was appointed, together with Carlo Armellini and Aurelio Saffi, as a member of the triumvirate of the new republic on 29 March, becoming soon the true leader of the government and showing good administrative capabilities in social reforms. However, the French troops called by the Pope made clear that the resistance of the Republican troops, led by Garibaldi, was in vain. On 12 July 1849, Mazzini set out for Marseille, from where he moved again to Switzerland.

===Late activities===
Mazzini spent all of 1850 hiding from the Swiss police. In July he founded the association &quot;Amici di Italia&quot; (&quot;Friends of Italy&quot;) in London, to attract consensus towards the Italian liberation cause. Failed riots in Mantua (1852) and the abortive Milan Uprising (1853) were a crippling blow for the Mazzinian organization, whose prestige never recovered. He later opposed the alliance signed by Savoy with Austria for the Crimean War. Also in vain was the expedition of Felice Orsini in Carrara of 1853–1854.

In 1856, he returned to Genoa to organize a series of uprisings: the only serious attempt was that of Carlo Pisacane in Calabria, which again met a disappointing end. Mazzini managed to escape the police but was condemned to death by default. From this moment on, Mazzini was more of a spectator than a protagonist of the Italian Risorgimento, whose reins were now strongly in the hands of the Savoyard monarch Victor Emmanuel II and his skilled prime minister, Camillo Benso, Conte di Cavour. The latter defined him as &quot;Chief of the Assassins&quot;.
In 1858, he founded another journal in London called &quot;Pensiero e azione&quot; (&quot;Thought and Action&quot;). On 21 February 1859, together with 151 republicans, he signed a manifesto against the alliance between Piedmont and the Emperor of France which resulted in the Second War of Italian Independence and the conquest of Lombardy. On 2 May 1860, he tried to reach Garibaldi, who was going to launch his famous Expedition of the Thousand in southern Italy. In the same year, he released &quot;Doveri dell&#x27;uomo&quot; (&quot;Duties of Man&quot;), a synthesis of his moral, political and social thoughts. In mid-September, he was in Naples, then under Garibaldi&#x27;s dictatorship, but was invited by the local vice-dictator Giorgio Pallavicino to move away.

The new Kingdom of Italy was created in 1861 under the Savoy monarchy. In 1862, Mazzini joined Garibaldi in his failed attempt to free Rome. In 1866, Italy joined the Austro-Prussian War and gained Venetia. At this time, Mazzini frequently spoke out against how the unification of his country was being achieved. In 1867, he refused a seat in the Italian Chamber of Deputies. In 1870, he tried to start a rebellion in Sicily and was arrested and imprisoned in Gaeta. In October, he was freed in the amnesty declared after the Kingdom finally took Rome and returned to London in mid-December.

Mazzini died of pleurisy at the house known now as Domus Mazziniana in Pisa in 1872, aged 66. His body was embalmed by Paolo Gorini. His funeral was held in Genoa, with 100,000 people taking part in it.

==Ideology==
An Italian nationalist, Mazzini was a fervent advocate of republicanism and envisioned a united, free and independent Italy. Unlike his contemporary Giuseppe Garibaldi, who was also a republican, Mazzini refused to swear an oath of allegiance to the House of Savoy until after the Capture of Rome. He and his followers were sensitive to the question of social justice, starting a dialogue with socialism, and Mazzini in particular finding many affinities with the Saint-Simonians. At the same time, Mazzini was vigorously opposed to Marxism, which for him was &quot;a dreadful perversion of utilitarianism because of its insistence on class interests, especially class struggle, a conflictual vision that could not harmonize with Mazzini&#x27;s unitarianism&quot;. Mazzini also rejected the classical liberal principles of the Age of Enlightenment based on the doctrine of individualism, which he criticized as &quot;presupposing either metaphysical materialism or political atheism&quot;. In the first volume of Carl Landauer&#x27;s &quot;European Socialism&quot;, Mazzini is mentioned alongside Garibaldi as outstanding &quot;Italian revolutionaries&quot;. Albert Charles Brouse argued that &quot;socialism is found in its entirety in the doctrine of Mazzini&quot;, his republicanism being both &quot;democratic and social&quot;.

In 1871, Mazzini condemned the radical, anti-religious and revolutionary socialist revolt in France that led to the creation of the short-lived Paris Commune. This caused Karl Marx to refer to Mazzini as a reactionary after 1848. It also prompted anarchist Mikhail Bakunin to write &quot;The Political Theology of Mazzini and the International&quot;, whose &quot;defence of the International and the Paris Commune caused a stir in Italy and provoked many renunciations of Mazzini and declarations of support for the International in the press&quot;, even leading to &quot;the first nationwide increase in membership in the organisation&quot;. In an interview by R. Landor from 1871, Marx stated that Mazzini&#x27;s ideas represented &quot;nothing better than the old idea of a middle-class republic&quot;. Marx believed that Mazzini&#x27;s point of view, especially after the Revolutions of 1848 and the Paris Commune, had become reactionary and the proletariat had nothing to do with it.

In another interview, Marx described Mazzini as &quot;that everlasting old ass&quot;. In turn, Mazzini described Marx as &quot;a destructive spirit whose heart was filled with hatred rather than love of mankind&quot; and declared that &quot;[d]espite the communist egalitarianism which [Marx] preaches, he is the absolute ruler of his party, admittedly he does everything himself, but he is also the only one to give orders and he tolerates no opposition&quot;. While Mazzini saw the Paris Commune as &quot;a socially divisive mistake&quot;, many other radicals &quot;followed the socialist lead and mythologised the Commune as a social revolution (&#x27;the glorius harbinger of a new society&#x27; in Karl Marx&#x27;s words)&quot;. This event &quot;allowed a significant section of the radical left, especially a younger generation of radicals led by the poet and satirist Felice Cavallotti and grouped around the newspaper &quot;Il Gazzettino Rosa&quot;, to break openly and decisively with both Mazzini and the principles and methods of Mazzinian politics. While &quot;Il Gazzettino Rosa&quot; praised Mazzini as &quot;the &#x27;saviour&#x27; and teacher of Italy&quot;, it insisted:
We have no more idols, we don&#x27;t accept abstruse, incomprehensible formulas. ... What we object to in Mazzini is not his opinion in itself, as much as his opinion erected into a system and a political dogma. We are materialists, but we don&#x27;t make a political school out of our materialism. To us it does not matter if one believes or does not believe in God. ... [I]nstead Mazzini wants to impose a new religion on us.

According to Lucy Riall, &quot;the emphasis by younger radicals on the &#x27;social question&#x27; was paralleled by an increase in what was called &#x27;internationalist&#x27; or socialist activity (mostly Bakuninist anarchism) throughout northern and southern Italy, which was given a big boost by the Paris Commune.&quot; The rise of this socialism &quot;represented a genuine challenge to Mazzini and the Mazzinian emphasis on politics and culture, and Mazzinis&#x27; death early in 1872 only served to underline the prevailing sense that his political era was over. Garibaldi now broke definitively with Mazzini, and this time he moved to the left of him. He came out entirely in favour of the Paris Commune and internationalism, and his stance brought him much closer to the younger radicals, ... and gave him a new lease on political life. From his support was born an initiative to relaunch a broad party of the radical left.&quot;
For Seamus Flahert, Henry Hyndman, who was an admirer of Mazzini, thought that &quot;Mazzini&#x27;s greatness ... was obscured for younger socialists by his &#x27;opposition to Marx in the early days of the &#x27;International&#x27;, and his vigorous condemnation a little later of the Paris Commune&quot;, insisting that &quot;Mazzini&#x27;s conception of the conduct of human life&#x27; had been &#x27;a high and noble one&#x27;&quot;, praising the &quot;No duties without rights&quot; mention in the &quot;General Rules&quot; that Marx composed and passed as &quot;a concession Marx made to Mazzini&#x27;s followers within the organisation&quot;. In his two-volume autobiography, Hyndman spoke at length about Mazzini, even comparing him to Marx.

Christopher Bayly wrote that Mazzini &quot;had arrived at similar conclusions&quot;, referring to &quot;the Saint-Simonian ideas of association and Charles Fourier&#x27;s &#x27;law of attraction&#x27;&quot;, but &quot;through an emotive process that owed little to rationalisation&quot;. As with the Christian socialist George D. Herron, Mazzini&#x27;s socialism was &quot;essentially a religious and moral revival&quot;. Mazzini rejected the Marxist doctrines of class struggle and materialism, stressing the need for class collaboration. Nonetheless, there was a more radical, socialist interpretation of Mazzini&#x27;s doctrine within the Italian Republican Party, a Mazzinian party, where &quot;there were many who believed the teachings of the Genoese patriot could be compatible with the Marxist doctrine and ... considered an alliance with the left-wing to be legitimate and desirable&quot;.

Mazzini&#x27;s Italian nationalism has been described as &quot;cosmopolitan patriotism&quot;. In &quot;Socialism: National or International&quot;, first published in 1942, Franz Borkenau described Mazzini as &quot;that impressive Genoese&quot; and &quot;leader of the Italian underground democratic and unitarian movement&quot;. About Mazzini and the underground movement, Borkenau further wrote:
Mazzini did a great deal to organize and united this underground movement, known under the name of &quot;Young Italy&quot;. He conceived the idea of parallel organizations in other European countries, which should all of them join in a &quot;Young Europe&quot; movement. The plan had only incipient success and Italy remained the sole stronghold of this underground movement. But the idea, though not its practical execution, caught on in other European countries. One reason of Mazzini&#x27;s partial failure was the emergence of socialism in France and England. France, at any rate, had a strong underground movement, much stronger under Louis-Philippe than previously under the Bourbon restoration. But this movement gradually evolved towards the left. Ordinary democrats of the Mazzini type were no longer persecuted in France after 1830. But to the left of them arose more advanced movements.

When he was a socialist, Benito Mussolini harshly criticized Mazzini, &quot;the religious Mazzini in particular&quot;, being &quot;particularly opposed to Mazzini&#x27;s &#x27;sanctification&#x27;&quot;. After advocating interventionism in World War I and enlisting, Mussolini &quot;found himself immersed in a patriotic atmosphere permeated by Mazzinian references&quot;.

===Religion===
Influenced by his Jansenist upbringing, Mazzini&#x27;s thought is characterized by a strong religious fervour and a deep sense of spirituality. A deist who believed in divine providence, Mazzini described himself as a Christian and emphasized the necessity of faith and a relationship with God while vehemently denouncing atheism and rationalism. His motto was &quot;Dio e Popolo&quot; (&quot;God and People&quot;). Mazzini regarded patriotism as a duty and love for the fatherland as a divine mission, stating that the fatherland was &quot;the home wherein God has placed us, among brothers and sisters linked to us by the family ties of a common religion, history, and language&quot;. According to A. James Gregor, &quot;Mazzini&#x27;s creed for the New Age thus radically distinguished itself from the orthodox Marxism of the nineteenth century. His Socialism was alive with moral purpose, rather than class identity, infused with exalted intent and specifically inspired by a sense of national, rather than class, mission. It saw itself, unabashedly, as a new religion, a &#x27;climb through &quot;philosophy&quot; to &quot;faith&quot;&#x27;. It was a religion predicated on a &#x27;living faith in one God, one Law, general and immutable ... and one End.&quot;

In his 1835 publication &quot;Fede e avvenire&quot; (&quot;Faith and the Future&quot;), Mazzini wrote: &quot;We must rise again as a religious party. The religious element is universal and immortal. ... The initiators of a new world, we are bound to lay the foundations of a moral unity, a Humanitarian Catholicism.&quot; However, Mazzini&#x27;s relationship with the Catholic Church and the Papacy was not always a kind one. While he initially supported Pope Pius IX upon his election, writing an open letter to him in 1847, Mazzini later published a scathing attack against the pope in his &quot;Sull&#x27;Enciclica di Papa Pio IX&quot; (&quot;On the Encyclical of Pope Pius IX&quot;) in 1849. Although some of his religious views were at odds with the Catholic Church and the Papacy, with his writings often tinged with anti-clericalism, Mazzini also criticized Protestantism, stating that it is &quot;divided and subdivided into a thousand sects, all founded on the rights of individual conscience, all eager to make war on one another, and perpetuating that anarchy of beliefs which is the sole true cause of the social and political disturbances that torment the peoples of Europe&quot;.

===Thought and action===
Mazzini rejected the concept of the &quot;rights of man&quot; which had developed during the Age of Enlightenment, arguing instead that individual rights were a duty to be won through hard work, sacrifice and virtue, rather than &quot;rights&quot; which were intrinsically owed to man. Mazzini outlined his thought in his &quot;Doveri dell&#x27;uomo&quot; (&quot;Duties of Man&quot;), published in 1860. Similarly, Mazzini formulated a concept known as &quot;thought and action&quot; in which thought and action must be joined together and every thought must be followed by action, therefore rejecting intellectualism and the notion of divorcing theory from practice.

===Women&#x27;s rights===
In &quot;Duties of Man&quot;, Mazzini called for recognition of women&#x27;s rights. After his many encounters with political philosophers in England, France and across Europe, Mazzini had decided that the principle of equality between men and women was fundamental to building a truly democratic Italian nation. He called for the end of women&#x27;s social and judicial subordination to men. Mazzini&#x27;s vigorous position heightened attention to gender among European thinkers who were already considering democracy and nationalism. He helped intellectuals see women&#x27;s rights not merely as a peripheral topic, but rather as a fundamental goal necessary for the regeneration of old nations and the rebirth of new ones. Mazzini admired Jessie White Mario, who was described by Giuseppe Garibaldi as the &quot;Bravest Woman of Modern Time&quot;. Mario joined Garibaldi&#x27;s Redshirts for the 1859–1860 campaign during the Second Italian War of Independence. As a correspondent for the &quot;Daily News&quot;, she witnessed almost every fight that had brought on the unification of Italy.

==Legacy==
Mazzini&#x27;s socio-political thought has been referred to as Mazzinianism and his worldview as the Mazzinian conception, terms that were later used by Mussolini and Italian fascists, such as Giovanni Gentile, to describe their political ideology and spiritual conception of life. 

In the first volume of his &quot;Reminiscences&quot;, Carl Schurz gives a biographical sketch of Mazzini and recalls two meetings he had with him when they were both in London in 1851. While the book &quot;10,000 Famous Freemasons&quot; by William R. Denslow lists Mazzini as a Mason and even a Past Grand Master of the Grand Orient of Italy, articles on the Grand Orient of Italy&#x27;s own website question whether he was ever a regular Mason and do not list him as a Past Grand Master.
The antifascist Mazzini Society, founded in the United States in 1939 by Italian political refugees, took his name and served Italy from exile, as he had.

In London, Mazzini resided at 155 North Gower Street, near Euston Square, which is now marked with a commemorative blue plaque. A plaque on Laystall Street in Clerkenwell, London&#x27;s Little Italy during the 1850s, also pays tribute to Mazzini, calling him &quot;The Apostle of Modern Democracy&quot;. Mazzini was an important influence on British idealists such as Thomas Hill Green, and other important figures at the University of Oxford (e.g., Benjamin Jowett and Algernon Swinburne) and the University of Cambridge (e.g., Henry Sidgwick). A bust of Mazzini is in New York&#x27;s Central Park between 67th and 68th streets just west of the West Drive. The 1973–1974 academic year at the College of Europe was named in his honour.

<text>Ritual Entertainment was an American video game developer established in 1996 by Robert Atkins, Mark Dochtermann, Jim Dosé, Richard &#x27;Levelord&#x27; Gray, Michael Hadwin, Harry Miller, and Tom Mustaine. Based in Dallas, Texas, Ritual Entertainment was formerly known as Hipnotic Interactive, during which period they began development of their signature video game &quot;SiN&quot;.

==History==
Members of the Ritual Entertainment development team have contributed assets to other games such as &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot;, &quot;Medal of Honor: Airborne&quot;, &quot;Tomb Raider: Legend&quot;, and &quot;25 to Life&quot;, and are also the creators of &quot;Übertools&quot; for id Tech 3, which has been licensed for a number of other games.

Shortly after signing Hipnotic, publisher Activision claimed that Hipnotic had been at the core of the &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; development team. &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; developer 3D Realms vigorously denied this, stating that only five members of Hipnotic Interactive were former staff of 3D Realms, and of these five only three had a significant role in making &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;.

In late 1997, Hipnotic changed their name to Ritual Entertainment in order to avoid a trademark conflict with another video-game developer, Hypnotix.

On January 24, 2007, developer MumboJumbo announced the acquisition of Ritual Entertainment. With this acquisition, Ritual&#x27;s focus on traditional action-oriented games was changed to casual games, essentially &quot;stalling&quot; Ritual&#x27;s latest game series, &quot;SiN Episodes&quot;, after releasing only one episode out of a planned nine.

The purchase followed months of departures of several key employees, including chief executive officer Steve Nix, who became director of business development at id Software, vice president and co-founder Tom Mustaine, who left to found Escalation Studios. Several months after the acquisition, community relations manager Steve Hessel left the company to join Splash Damage.

Prior to the announcement, on December 6, 2006, Ritual announced the appointment of Ken Harward as the company&#x27;s new studio director.

Following the company&#x27;s closure, many of the deveopers have left to other companies such as id Software, Gearbox Software, Nerve Software, Escalation Studios, and the now-defunct Paradigm Entertainment.

<text>SPARC (Scalable Processor ARChitecture) is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) instruction set architecture originally developed by Sun Microsystems. Its design was strongly influenced by the experimental Berkeley RISC system developed in the early 1980s. First developed in 1986 and released in 1987, SPARC was one of the most successful early commercial RISC systems, and its success led to the introduction of similar RISC designs from many vendors through the 1980s and 1990s.

The first implementation of the original 32-bit architecture (SPARC V7) was used in Sun&#x27;s Sun-4 computer workstation and server systems, replacing their earlier Sun-3 systems based on the Motorola 68000 series of processors. SPARC V8 added a number of improvements that were part of the SuperSPARC series of processors released in 1992. SPARC V9, released in 1993, introduced a 64-bit architecture and was first released in Sun&#x27;s UltraSPARC processors in 1995. Later, SPARC processors were used in symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) and non-uniform memory access (CC-NUMA) servers produced by Sun, Solbourne, and Fujitsu, among others.

The design was turned over to the SPARC International trade group in 1989, and since then its architecture has been developed by its members. SPARC International is also responsible for licensing and promoting the SPARC architecture, managing SPARC trademarks (including SPARC, which it owns), and providing conformance testing. SPARC International was intended to grow the SPARC architecture to create a larger ecosystem; SPARC has been licensed to several manufacturers, including Atmel, Bipolar Integrated Technology, Cypress Semiconductor, Fujitsu, Matsushita and Texas Instruments. Due to SPARC International, SPARC is fully open, non-proprietary and royalty-free.

As of 2024, the latest commercial high-end SPARC processors are Fujitsu&#x27;s SPARC64 XII (introduced in September 2017 for its SPARC M12 server) and Oracle&#x27;s SPARC M8 introduced in September 2017 for its high-end servers.

On September 1, 2017, after a round of layoffs that started in Oracle Labs in November 2016, Oracle terminated SPARC design after completing the M8. Much of the processor core development group in Austin, Texas, was dismissed, as were the teams in Santa Clara, California, and Burlington, Massachusetts.

Fujitsu will also discontinue their SPARC production (has already shifted to producing their own ARM-based CPUs), after two &quot;enhanced&quot; versions of Fujitsu&#x27;s older SPARC M12 server in 2020–22 (formerly planned for 2021) and again in 2026–27, end-of-sale in 2029, of UNIX servers and a year later for their mainframe and end-of-support in 2034 &quot;to promote customer modernization&quot;.

==Features==
The SPARC architecture was heavily influenced by the earlier RISC designs, including the RISC I and II from the University of California, Berkeley and the IBM 801. These original RISC designs were minimalist, including as few features or op-codes as possible and aiming to execute instructions at a rate of almost one instruction per clock cycle. This made them similar to the MIPS architecture in many ways, including the lack of instructions such as multiply or divide. Another feature of SPARC influenced by this early RISC movement is the branch delay slot.

The SPARC processor usually contains as many as 160 general-purpose registers. According to the &quot;Oracle SPARC Architecture 2015&quot; specification an &quot;implementation may contain from 72 to 640 general-purpose 64-bit&quot; registers. At any point, only 32 of them are immediately visible to software — 8 are a set of global registers (one of which, g0, is hard-wired to zero, so only seven of them are usable as registers) and the other 24 are from the stack of registers. These 24 registers form what is called a register window, and at function call/return, this window is moved up and down the register stack. Each window has eight local registers and shares eight registers with each of the adjacent windows. The shared registers are used for passing function parameters and returning values, and the local registers are used for retaining local values across function calls.

The &quot;scalable&quot; in SPARC comes from the fact that the SPARC specification allows implementations to scale from embedded processors up through large server processors, all sharing the same core (non-privileged) instruction set. One of the architectural parameters that can scale is the number of implemented register windows; the specification allows from three to 32 windows to be implemented, so the implementation can choose to implement all 32 to provide maximum call stack efficiency, or to implement only three to reduce cost and complexity of the design, or to implement some number between them. Other architectures that include similar register file features include Intel i960, IA-64, and AMD 29000.

The architecture has gone through several revisions. It gained hardware multiply and divide functionality in version 8. 64-bit (addressing and data) were added to the version 9 SPARC specification published in 1994.

In SPARC version 8, the floating-point register file has 16 double-precision registers. Each of them can be used as two single-precision registers, providing a total of 32 single-precision registers. An odd–even number pair of double-precision registers can be used as a quad-precision register, thus allowing 8 quad-precision registers. SPARC Version 9 added 16 more double-precision registers (which can also be accessed as 8 quad-precision registers), but these additional registers can not be accessed as single-precision registers. No SPARC CPU implements quad-precision operations in hardware as of 2024.

Tagged add and subtract instructions perform adds and subtracts on values checking that the bottom two bits of both operands are 0 and reporting overflow if they are not. This can be useful in the implementation of the run time for ML, Lisp, and similar languages that might use a tagged integer format.

The endianness of the 32-bit SPARC V8 architecture is purely big-endian. The 64-bit SPARC V9 architecture uses big-endian instructions, but can access data in either big-endian or little-endian byte order, chosen either at the application instruction (load–store) level or at the memory page level (via an MMU setting). The latter is often used for accessing data from inherently little-endian devices, such as those on PCI buses.

==History==
There have been three major revisions of the architecture. The first published version was the 32-bit &quot;SPARC version 7&quot; (V7) in 1986. &quot;SPARC version 8&quot; (V8), an enhanced SPARC architecture definition, was released in 1990. The main differences between V7 and V8 were the addition of integer multiply and divide instructions, and an upgrade from 80-bit &quot;extended-precision&quot; floating-point arithmetic to 128-bit &quot;quad-precision&quot; arithmetic. SPARC V8 served as the basis for IEEE Standard 1754-1994, an IEEE standard for a 32-bit microprocessor architecture.

&quot;SPARC version 9&quot;, the 64-bit SPARC architecture, was released by SPARC International in 1993. It was developed by the SPARC Architecture Committee consisting of Amdahl Corporation, Fujitsu, ICL, LSI Logic, Matsushita, Philips, Ross Technology, Sun Microsystems, and Texas Instruments. Newer specifications always remain compliant with the full SPARC V9 Level 1 specification.

In 2002, the SPARC &quot;Joint Programming Specification 1&quot; (JPS1) was released by Fujitsu and Sun, describing processor functions which were identically implemented in the CPUs of both companies (&quot;Commonality&quot;). The first CPUs conforming to JPS1 were the UltraSPARC III by Sun and the SPARC64 V by Fujitsu. Functionalities which are not covered by JPS1 are documented for each processor in &quot;Implementation Supplements&quot;.

At the end of 2003, JPS2 was released to support multicore CPUs. The first CPUs conforming to JPS2 were the UltraSPARC IV by Sun and the SPARC64 VI by Fujitsu.

In early 2006, Sun released an extended architecture specification, &quot;UltraSPARC Architecture 2005&quot;. This includes not only the non-privileged and most of the privileged portions of SPARC V9, but also all the architectural extensions developed through the processor generations of UltraSPARC III, IV, and IV+, as well as CMT extensions starting with the UltraSPARC T1 implementation:

* the VIS 1 and VIS 2 instruction set extensions and the associated GSR register
* multiple levels of global registers, controlled by the GL register
* Sun&#x27;s 64-bit MMU architecture
* privileged instructions ALLCLEAN, OTHERW, NORMALW, and INVALW
* access to the VER register is now hyperprivileged
* the SIR instruction is now hyperprivileged

In 2007, Sun released an updated specification, &quot;UltraSPARC Architecture 2007&quot;, to which the UltraSPARC T2 implementation complied.

In December 2007, Sun also made the UltraSPARC T2 processor&#x27;s RTL available via the OpenSPARC project. It was also released under the GNU General public license v2. OpenSPARC T2 is 8 cores, 16 pipelines with 64 threads.

In August 2012, Oracle Corporation made available a new specification, &quot;Oracle SPARC Architecture 2011&quot;, which besides the overall update of the reference, adds the VIS 3 instruction set extensions and hyperprivileged mode to the 2007 specification.

In October 2015, Oracle released SPARC M7, the first processor based on the new &quot;Oracle SPARC Architecture 2015&quot; specification. This revision includes VIS 4 instruction set extensions and hardware-assisted encryption and silicon secured memory (SSM).

SPARC architecture has provided continuous application binary compatibility from the first SPARC V7 implementation in 1987 through the Sun UltraSPARC Architecture implementations.

Among various implementations of SPARC, Sun&#x27;s SuperSPARC and UltraSPARC-I were very popular, and were used as reference systems for SPEC CPU95 and CPU2000 benchmarks. The 296 MHz UltraSPARC-II is the reference system for the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark.

==Architecture==
SPARC is a load–store architecture (also known as a &quot;register–register architecture&quot;); except for the load/store instructions used to access memory, all instructions operate on the registers, in accordance with the RISC design principles.

A SPARC processor includes an integer unit (IU) that performs integer load, store, and arithmetic operations. It may include a floating-point unit (FPU) that performs floating-point operations and, for SPARC V8, may include a co-processor (CP) that performs co-processor-specific operations; the architecture does not specify what functions a co-processor would perform, other than load and store operations.

===Registers===
The SPARC architecture has an overlapping register window scheme. At any instant, 32 general-purpose registers are visible. A Current Window Pointer (&quot;CWP&quot;) variable in the hardware points to the current set. The total size of the register file is not part of the architecture, allowing more registers to be added as the technology improves, up to a maximum of 32 windows in SPARC V7 and V8 as &quot;CWP&quot; is 5 bits and is part of the &quot;PSR&quot; register.

In SPARC V7 and V8 &quot;CWP&quot; will usually be decremented by the SAVE instruction (used by the SAVE instruction during the procedure call to open a new stack frame and switch the register window), or incremented by the RESTORE instruction (switching back to the call before returning from the procedure). Trap events (interrupts, exceptions or TRAP instructions) and RETT instructions (returning from traps) also change the &quot;CWP&quot;. For SPARC V9, CWP register is decremented during a RESTORE instruction, and incremented during a SAVE instruction. This is the opposite of PSR.CWP&#x27;s behavior in SPARC V8. This change has no effect on nonprivileged instructions.

SPARC registers are shown in the figure above.

There is also a non-windowed Y register, used by the multiply-step, integer multiply, and integer divide instructions.

A SPARC V8 processor with an FPU includes 32 32-bit floating-point registers, each of which can hold one single-precision IEEE 754 floating-point number. An even–odd pair of floating-point registers can hold one double-precision IEEE 754 floating-point number, and a quad-aligned group of four floating-point registers can hold one quad-precision IEEE 754 floating-point number.

A SPARC V9 processor with an FPU includes:

* 32 32-bit floating-point registers, each of which can hold one single-precision IEEE 754 floating-point number;
* 32 64-bit floating-point registers, each of which can hold one double-precision IEEE 754 floating-point number;
* 16 128-bit floating-point registers, each of which can hold one quad-precision IEEE 754 floating-point number.

The registers are organized as a set of 64 32-bit registers, with the first 32 being used as the 32-bit floating-point registers, even–odd pairs of all 64 registers being used as the 64-bit floating-point registers, and quad-aligned groups of four floating-point registers being used as the 128-bit floating-point registers.

Floating-point registers are not windowed; they are all global registers.

===Instruction formats===
All SPARC instructions occupy a full 32-bit word and start on a word boundary. Four formats are used, distinguished by the first two bits. All arithmetic and logical instructions have 2 source operands and 1 destination operand. RD is the &quot;destination register&quot;, where the output of the operation is deposited. The majority of SPARC instructions have at least this register, so it is placed near the &quot;front&quot; of the instruction format. RS1 and RS2 are the &quot;source registers&quot;, which may or may not be present, or replaced by a constant.

===Instructions===
====Loads and stores====
Load and store instructions have a three-operand format, in that they have two operands representing values for the address and one operand for the register to read or write to. The address is created by adding the two address operands to produce an address. The second address operand may be a constant or a register. Loads take the value at the address and place it in the register specified by the third operand, whereas stores take the value in the register specified by the first operand and place it at the address. To make this more obvious, the assembler language indicates address operands using square brackets with a plus sign separating the operands, instead of using a comma-separated list. Examples:

 ld [%L1+%L2],%L3 !load the 32-bit value at address %L1+%L2 and put the value into %L3
 ld [%L1+8],%L2 !load the value at %L1+8 into %L2
 ld [%L1],%L2 !as above, but no offset, which is the same as +%G0
 st %L1,[%I2] !store the value in %L1 into the location stored in %I2
 st %G0,[%I1+8] !clear the memory at %I1+8

Due to the widespread use of non-32-bit data, such as 16-bit or 8-bit integral data or 8-bit bytes in strings, there are instructions that load and store 16-bit half-words and 8-bit bytes, as well as instructions that load 32-bit words. During a load, those instructions will read only the byte or half-word at the indicated location and then either fill the rest of the target register with zeros (unsigned load) or with the value of the uppermost bit of the byte or half-word (signed load). During a store, those instructions discard the upper bits in the register and store only the lower bits. There are also instructions for loading double-precision values used for floating-point arithmetic, reading or writing eight bytes from the indicated register and the &quot;next&quot; one, so if the destination of a load is L1, L1 and L2 will be set. The complete list of load and store instructions for the general-purpose registers in 32-bit SPARC is , , (unsigned byte), (signed byte), (unsigned half-word), (signed half-word), (load double), (store byte), (store half-word), (store double).

In SPARC V9, registers are 64-bit, and the instruction, renamed , clears the upper 32 bits in the register and loads the 32-bit value into the lower 32 bits, and the instruction, renamed , discards the upper 32 bits of the register and stores only the lower 32 bits. The new instruction sets the upper bits in the register to the value of the uppermost bit of the word and loads the 32-bit value into the lower bits. The new instruction loads a 64-bit value into the register, and the instruction stores all 64 bits of the register.

The , , and instructions load a single-precision, double-precision, or quad-precision value from memory into a floating-point register; the , , and instructions store a single-precision, double-precision, or quad-precision floating-point register into memory.

The memory barrier instruction, MEMBAR, serves two interrelated purposes: it articulates order constraints among memory references and facilitates explicit control over the completion of memory references. For example, all effects of the stores that appear prior to the MEMBAR instruction must be made visible to all processors before any loads following the MEMBAR can be executed.

====ALU operations====
Arithmetic and logical instructions also use a three-operand format, with the first two being the operands and the last being the location to store the result. The middle operand can be a register or a 13-bit signed integer constant; the other operands are registers. Any of the register operands may point to G0; pointing the result to G0 discards the results, which can be used for tests. Examples include:

 add %L1,%L2,%L3 !add the values in %L1 and %L2 and put the result in %L3
 add %L1,1,%L1 !increment %L1
 add %G0,%G0,%L4 !clear any value in %L4

The list of mathematical instructions is , , , , , and negated versions , , and . One quirk of the SPARC design is that most arithmetic instructions come in pairs, with one version setting the NZVC condition code bits in the status register, and the other not setting them, with the default being &quot;not&quot; to set the codes. This is so that the compiler has a way to move instructions around when trying to fill delay slots. If one wants the condition codes to be set, this is indicated by adding to the instruction:

 subcc %L1,10,%G0 !compare %L1 to 10 and ignore the result, but set the flags

add and sub also have another modifier, X, which indicates whether the operation should set the carry bit:

 addx %L1,100,%L1 !add 100 to the value in %L1 and track carry

SPARC V7 does not have multiplication or division instructions, but it does have , which does one step of a multiplication testing one bit and conditionally adding the multiplicand to the product. This was because can complete over one clock cycle in keeping with the RISC philosophy. SPARC V8 added (unsigned multiply), (signed multiply), (unsigned divide), and (signed divide) instructions, with both versions that do not update the condition codes and versions that do. and the multiply instructions use the Y register to hold the upper 32 bits of the product; the divide instructions use it to hold the upper 32 bits of the dividend. The instruction reads the value of the Y register into a general-purpose register; the instruction writes the value of a general-purpose register to the Y register. SPARC V9 added , which multiplies two 64-bit values and produces a 64-bit result, , which divides a 64-bit signed dividend by a 64-bit signed divisor and produces a 64-bit signed quotient, and , which divides a 64-bit unsigned dividend by a 64-bit unsigned divisor and produces a 64-bit signed quotient; none of those instructions use the Y register.

====Branching====
Conditional branches test condition codes in a status register, as seen in many instruction sets such the IBM System/360 architecture and successors and the x86 architecture. This means that a test and branch is normally performed with two instructions; the first is an ALU instruction that sets the condition codes, followed by a branch instruction that examines one of those flags. The SPARC does not have specialized test instructions; tests are performed using normal ALU instructions with the destination set to %G0. For instance, to test if a register holds the value 10 and then branch to code that handles it, one would:

 subcc %L1,10,%G0 !subtract 10 from %L1, setting the zero flag if %L1 is 10
 be WASEQUAL !if the zero flag is set, branch to the address marked WASEQUAL

In a conditional branch instruction, the icc or fcc field specifies the condition being tested. The 22-bit displacement field is the address, relative to the current PC, of the target, in words, so that conditional branches can go forward or backward up to 8 megabytes. The &quot;ANNUL&quot; (A) bit is used to get rid of some delay slots. If it is 0 in a conditional branch, the delay slot is executed as usual. If it is 1, the delay slot is only executed if the branch is taken. If it is not taken, the instruction following the conditional branch is skipped.

There are a wide variety of conditional branches: (branch always, essentially a jmp), (branch never), (equals), (not equals), (less than), (less or equal), (less or equal, unsigned), (greater), (greater or equal), (greater unsigned), (positive), (negative), (carry clear), (carry set), (overflow clear), (overflow set).

The FPU and CP have sets of condition codes separate from the integer condition codes and from each other; two additional sets of branch instructions were defined to test those condition codes. Adding an F to the front of the branch instruction in the list above performs the test against the FPU&#x27;s condition codes, while, in SPARC V8, adding a C tests the flags in the otherwise undefined CP.

The (jump to subroutine) instruction uses a 30-bit program counter-relative &quot;word&quot; offset. As the target address is specifying the start of a word, not a byte, 30-bits is all that is needed to reach any address in the 4 gigabyte address space. The CALL instruction deposits the return address in register R15, also known as output register O7.

The (jump and link) instruction is a three-operand instruction, with two operands representing values for the target address and one operand for a register in which to deposit the return address. The address is created by adding the two address operands to produce a 32-bit address. The second address operand may be a constant or a register.

====Large constants====
As the instruction opcode takes up some bits of the 32-bit instruction word, there is no way to load a 32-bit constant using a single instruction. This is significant because addresses are manipulated through registers and they are 32-bits. To ease this, the special-purpose instruction copies its 22-bit immediate operand into the high-order 22 bits of any specified register, and sets each of the low-order 10 bits to 0. In general use, SETHI is followed by an or instruction with only the lower 10 bits of the value set. To ease this, the assembler includes the and macros. For example:

 sethi %hi(0x89ABCDEF),%L1 !sets the upper 22 bits of L1
 or %L1,%lo(0x89ABCDEF),%L1 !sets the lower 10 bits of L1 by ORing

The hi and lo macros are performed at assembly time, not runtime, so it has no performance hit yet makes it clearer that L1 is set to a single value, not two unrelated ones. To make this even easier, the assembler also includes a &quot;synthetic instruction&quot;, , that performs these two operations in a single line:

 set 0x89ABCDEF,% L1

This outputs the two instructions above if the value is larger than 13 bits, otherwise it will emit a single with the value.

===Synthetic instructions===
As noted earlier, the SPARC assembler uses &quot;synthetic instructions&quot; to ease common coding tasks. Additional examples include (among others):

==SPARC architecture licensees==
Intel was the 80386&#x27;s only producer, which made it very expensive and caused the industry to be wary of sole sourced CPUs. When Sun announced SPARC in 1987, the company stated that it would be available from multiple sources. Fujitsu was the first SPARC vendor, and Cypress Semiconductor was the second licensee; their SPARC CPUs were available, as was Texas Instruments&#x27;s FPU. The following organizations have licensed the SPARC architecture:

SPARC machines have generally used Sun&#x27;s SunOS, Solaris, JavaOS, or OpenSolaris including derivatives illumos and OpenIndiana, but other operating systems have also been used, such as NeXTSTEP, RTEMS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and Linux.

In 1993, Intergraph announced a port of Windows NT to the SPARC architecture, but it was later cancelled.

In October 2015, Oracle announced a &quot;Linux for SPARC reference platform&quot;.

==Supercomputers==
For HPC loads Fujitsu builds specialized SPARC64 fx processors with a new instruction extensions set, called HPC-ACE (High Performance Computing – Arithmetic Computational Extensions).

Fujitsu&#x27;s K computer ranked in the TOP500 June 2011 and November 2011 lists. It combines 88,128 SPARC64 VIIIfx CPUs, each with eight cores, for a total of 705,024 cores—almost twice as many as any other system in the TOP500 at that time. The K Computer was more powerful than the next five systems on the list combined, and had the highest performance-to-power ratio of any supercomputer system. It also ranked in the Green500 June 2011 list, with a score of 824.56 MFLOPS/W. In the November 2012 release of TOP500, the K computer ranked , using by far the most power of the top three. It ranked on the corresponding Green500 release. Newer HPC processors, IXfx and XIfx, were included in recent PRIMEHPC FX10 and FX100 supercomputers.

Tianhe-2 (TOP500 as of November 2014) has a number of nodes with Galaxy FT-1500 OpenSPARC-based processors developed in China. However, those processors did not contribute to the LINPACK score.

<doc id="36956" wikidata="Q159774" url="?curid=36956" title="Cappuccino">
<text>Cappuccino (, ; from German ) is an espresso-based coffee drink that is traditionally prepared with steamed milk including a layer of milk foam.

Variations of the drink involve the use of cream instead of milk, using non-dairy milk substitutes and flavoring with cocoa powder (in Europe and Australasia) or cinnamon (in the United States and South Korea). It is typically smaller in volume than that of a caffè latte, and topped with a thick layer of foam rather than being made with microfoam.

The name comes from the Capuchin friars, referring to the color of their habits, and in this context, referring to the color of the beverage when milk is added in small portion to dark, brewed coffee (today mostly espresso). The physical appearance of a modern cappuccino with espresso crema and steamed milk is a result of a long evolution of the drink. 

The Viennese bestowed the name , possibly in the 18th century, on an early version that included whipped cream and spices. Later, the was introduced in northern Italy during the period of Austrian domination and Italians started to use it for the beverage as well the friar dress. It is sometimes said to have been served in the coffeehouses of Trieste and other Italian areas of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the early 20th century, spreading throughout the Kingdom of Italy after World War I. However, the existence in central Italy of a coffee drink mixed with milk named is already documented in the 19th century.

==Definition and etymology==
===Definition===
A cappuccino is a coffee drink that today is typically composed of a single, double, or triple espresso shot and hot milk, with the surface topped with foamed milk. Cappuccinos are most often prepared with an espresso machine. The espresso is poured into the bottom of the cup, followed by a similar amount of hot milk which is prepared by heating and texturing the milk using the espresso machine steam wand. The top third of the drink consists of milk foam which is also made using the steam wand. The drink may then topped with powdered chocolate or cocoa powder.

In a traditional cappuccino, as served in Europe and artisan coffeehouses in the United States, the total of espresso and milk/foam make up between approximately . Commercial coffee restaurant chains in the US more often serve the cappuccino as a drink or larger. In Italy, a cappuccino consists of of espresso; the rest of the cup is filled with equal parts of milk and foam. Outside of Italy, the ratios of espresso, milk, and foam typically equal 1/3 each.

A cappuccino is traditionally served in a small cup with a handle (180 ml maximum) with a thick layer of foam, while a caffè latte is espresso and milk (200–300 ml), with the milk steamed to be hot and to form microfoam, and is usually served in a large glass.

The World Barista Championships have been arranged annually since 2000, and during the course of the competition, the competing barista must produce—for four sensory judges—among other drinks four cappuccinos, defined in WBC Rules and Regulations as &quot;[...] a coffee and milk beverage that should produce a harmonious balance of rich, sweet milk and espresso [...] The cappuccino is prepared with one (1) single shot of espresso, textured milk and foam (&quot;textured milk&quot; is milk that has been aerated to its proper foam level). A minimum of 1 centimeter of foam depth [...] A cappuccino is a beverage between 150 ml and 180 ml in total volume [...].&quot;

===Etymology===
 comes from Latin , later borrowed in German/Austrian and modified into . It is the diminutive form of in Italian, meaning or something that covers the head, thus literally means .

The coffee beverage has its name not from the &quot;hood&quot; but from the &quot;color&quot; of the hooded robes worn by friars and nuns of the Capuchin order. This color is quite distinctive, and &quot;capuchin&quot; was a common description of the color of red-brown in 17th-century Europe. The Capuchin friars chose the particular design of their orders&#x27; robes both in color and shape of the hood back in the 16th century, inspired by Francis of Assisi&#x27;s preserved 13th-century vestments. The long and pointed hood was characteristic and soon gave the brothers the nickname &quot;capuchins&quot; (hood-wearing). It was, however, the choice of red-brown as the order&#x27;s vestment color that, as early as the 17th century, saw &quot;capuchin&quot; used also as a term for a specific color. While Francis of Assisi used uncolored and unbleached wool for his robes, the Capuchins colored their vestments to differ from Augustinians, Benedictines, Franciscans, and other orders.

The word , in its Italian form, appears in Italian writings in the 19th century and is described as &quot;black coffee with a few drops of milk or cream which give it the color the tunic of the Capuchins, from which it takes its name&quot;. The German language is mentioned as a coffee beverage in the 18th century in Austria, and is described as, &quot;coffee with sugar, egg yolks and cream&quot;, in dictionary entries from 1800 onwards.

==History and evolution==


The consumption of coffee in Europe was initially based on the traditional Ottoman preparation of the drink, by bringing to boil the mixture of coffee and water together, sometimes adding sugar. The British seem to have already started filtering and steeping coffee in the second half of the 18th century, and France and continental Europe followed suit. By the 19th century, coffee was brewed in different devices designed for both home and public cafés.

Adding milk to coffee was already mentioned by Europeans in the 1700s.

 showed up in coffee house menus all over the Habsburg monarchy around the late 1700s.

 took its name from the color of coffee with a few drops of cream, so nicknamed because the Capuchin friars in Vienna and elsewhere wore vestments of this color. Another popular coffee was , with more cream, referring to the somewhat lighter brown of the tunics of the Franciscan order. coffee spread throughout Central Europe, including the Italian-speaking parts of the Habsburg monarchy. The main port of the empire, the city of Trieste, already had many Viennese coffee houses. According to a popular but unverified legend, cappuccino was named after the Italian Capuchin friar Marco d&#x27;Aviano, who contributed to the victory of the Battle of Vienna.

The use of fresh milk in coffee in cafés and restaurants is a newer phenomenon (from the 20th century), introduced when refrigeration became common. The use of full cream is known much further back in time (but not in the use as whipped cream [chantilly]), as this was a product more easily stored and frequently used also in cooking and baking. Thus, a was prepared with a very small amount of cream to get the capuchin color. Today, is still served in Viennese traditional cafés, comprising still black coffee with only a few drops of cream (in some establishments developed into a dollop of whipped cream), or frothed milk instead of cream.

 as written today (in Italian) is first mentioned in the 19th century and is described as &quot;black coffee with a few drops of milk or cream&quot;. The modern Italian cappuccino evolved and developed in the following decades: the steamed milk on top is a later addition, and in the US a slight misunderstanding has led to the naming of this &quot;cap&quot; of milk foam &quot;monk&#x27;s head&quot;, although it originally had nothing to do with the name of the beverage. remained unchanged on some Austrian coffee menus and in Bratislava, Budapest, Prague, and other cities of the former empire, but it also is found in a modernized version that includes black coffee and frothed milk only.

Espresso machines were introduced at the beginning of the 20th century.

After World War II, the Italians launched the &quot;age of crema&quot;, as the new coffee machines could create a higher pressure, leading to a finer grind and the now classic crema.

In the United Kingdom, espresso coffee initially gained popularity in the form of cappuccino, influenced by the British custom of drinking coffee with milk, the desire for a longer drink to preserve the café as a destination, and the exotic texture of the beverage.

In the United States, cappuccino spread alongside espresso in Italian American neighborhoods, such as Boston&#x27;s North End, New York&#x27;s Little Italy, and San Francisco&#x27;s North Beach. New York City&#x27;s Caffe Reggio (founded in 1927) claims to have introduced cappuccino to the United States, while San Francisco&#x27;s Caffe Trieste (founded in 1956) claims to have introduced it to the west coast; the earlier Tosca Cafe in San Francisco (founded in 1919) served a &quot;cappuccino&quot; earlier, but this was without coffee, and instead consisted of chocolate, steamed milk, and brandy.

==Popularity==
In Italy and throughout continental Europe, cappuccino is traditionally consumed in the morning, usually as part of breakfast, often with some type of pastry. Italians generally do not drink cappuccino with meals other than breakfast, although they often drink espresso after lunch or dinner. In Italy, cappuccino is usually consumed up to 11:00am, since cappuccinos are milk-based and considered too heavy to drink later in the day. Instead, espresso is usually ordered after a meal due to the belief that the lack of milk aids in digestion. In North America, cappuccinos have become popular concurrent with the boom in the American coffee industry through the late 1990s and early 2000s, especially in the urban Pacific Northwest. In South Korea, espresso and its variants (cappuccino, latte, and &quot;caffè mocha&quot;) became popular in 2000.

Cappuccino is traditionally served in cups. By the start of the 21st century, a modified &quot;short-cut&quot; version was being served by fast-food chains in servings up to .

==Preparation==

===Traditional===

Although size is what varies most among cappuccinos served in different regions, the traditional way of preparing cappuccino is to add equal proportions of the ingredients: espresso, steamed milk and milk foam. The drink may often be topped with a dusting of chocolate or cocoa powder. Instead of pouring the steamed milk and then adding the foam, some baristas may instead prepare an extra foamy milk with the steam wand and then pour in this mixture of hot milk and foam as one, as this saves time compared to separately pouring the hot milk and then layering on the foam.

===&quot;Freddo cappuccino&quot;===
In Greece and Cyprus, a cold cappuccino is widespread known as &quot;freddo cappuccino&quot;, as opposed to &quot;cappuccino freddo&quot;. Despite its Italian name, the drink both tastes and is prepared differently from its Italian counterpart, and is uncommon outside of Greece. &quot;Freddo cappuccino&quot; is topped with a cold milk-based foam known as &quot;afrógala&quot; (Greek: ), which is created by blending cold milk using an electric frother. These frothers are commonplace in Greek coffee shops due to their usage during the preparation of frappé coffee. The foam is then added to espresso poured over ice.

Along with the &quot;freddo espresso&quot;, they were conceived in Greece in 1991 and are in higher demand during summer. Outside Greece and Cyprus, &quot;freddo cappuccino&quot; or &quot;cappuccino freddo&quot; is mostly found in coffee shops and delis catering to the Greek expat community. In 2017, Starbucks added &quot;cappuccino freddo&quot; to branch menus in Europe.

==Similar drinks==
Other milk and espresso drinks similar to the cappuccino include:
* Macchiato (short for &quot;caffè macchiato&quot;, sometimes &quot;espresso macchiato&quot;) is a significantly shorter drink, which consists of espresso with only a small amount of milk.
* Cortado is a Spanish hybrid: a slightly shorter drink, which consists of espresso mixed with milk in a 1:1 to 1:2 ratio, and is not topped with foam. Café cortado has traditionally been served in a small glass on a saucer, and its character comes from the Spanish preference of coffee beans and roast plus condensed milk replacing fresh dairy milk. Modern coffee shops have started using fresh milk.
* Flat white is a drink which is popular in Australia and New Zealand. It can be described either as a latte served in a small cup (like a cappuccino would be), or a cappuccino made with steamed textured milk and with no foam on top (&quot;flat&quot; indicating less foam), and is typically prepared with latte art. 
* Latte (short for &quot;caffè latte&quot;) is a larger drink, with the same amount of espresso, but with more milk textured to contain microfoam, served in a large cup or tall glass, sometimes with the milk poured to make a pattern (latte art).
* Steamer (or &quot;babycino&quot;) is a drink of frothed milk without coffee (hence no caffeine). In the United States it often has flavored syrup added, while in Commonwealth countries it instead often has a dusting of cocoa powder.

<text>Kenneth Charles Williams (22 February 1926 – 15 April 1988) was a British actor and comedian. He was best known for his comedy roles and in later life as a raconteur and diarist. He was one of the main ensemble in 26 of the 31 &quot;Carry On&quot; films, and appeared in many British television programmes and radio comedies, including series with Tony Hancock and Kenneth Horne, as well as being a frequent panellist on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s comedy panel show &quot;Just a Minute&quot; from its second series in 1968 until his death 20 years later.

Williams grew up in Central London in a working-class family; he claimed his father spoke Cockney. He served in the Royal Engineers during World War II, where he first became interested in becoming an entertainer. After a short spell in repertory theatre as a serious actor, he turned to comedy and achieved national fame in &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;. He sustained continued success throughout the 1960s and 1970s with his regular appearances in &quot;Carry On&quot; films, and subsequently kept himself in the public eye with chat shows and other television work.

Williams was fondly regarded in the entertainment industry; in his private life, however, he suffered from depression. He kept a series of diaries throughout his life that achieved posthumous acclaim.

==Early life and education==
Kenneth Charles Williams was born on 22 February 1926 in Bingfield Street, King&#x27;s Cross, London. His parents were Charles George Williams, who managed a hairdresser&#x27;s in the Kings Cross area, and Louisa Alexandra (&quot;née&quot; Morgan), who worked in the salon. Charles was a Methodist who had &quot;a hatred of loose morals and effeminacy&quot;, according to Barry Took, Williams&#x27;s biographer. Charles thought the theatre immoral and effeminate, although his son aspired to be involved in the profession from an early age. Between 1935 and 1956, Williams lived with his parents in a flat above his father&#x27;s barber shop at 57 Marchmont Street, Bloomsbury. Williams had a half-sister, Alice Patricia &quot;Pat&quot;, born to his mother in 1923 before she had met Charles and three years before Kenneth was born.

He was educated at The Lyulph Stanley Boys&#x27; Central Council School, a state-owned Central school, in Camden Town, North London, and subsequently became apprenticed as a draughtsman to a mapmaker. His apprenticeship was interrupted by the Blitz, and he was evacuated to the home of a bachelor veterinary surgeon in Bicester. It provided his first experience of an educated, middle-class life. He returned to London with a new, vowel-elongated accent. In 1944, aged 18, he was called up to the British Army. He became a sapper in the Royal Engineers Survey Section, doing much the same work that he did as a civilian. When the war ended he was in Ceylon and he opted to transfer to the Combined Services Entertainment Unit, which put on revue shows. While in that unit he met Stanley Baxter, Peter Vaughan, Peter Nichols and John Schlesinger.

Both of Williams&#x27; parents were born in London, but with a Welsh heritage extending for several generations. Williams sometimes described himself as Welsh, noting his parents&#x27; surnames and origins in his diaries and in interviews.: In 1968, during the filming of &quot;Carry On Up the Khyber&quot; in Snowdonia National Park, Williams stated that &quot;I always like being back in Wales. I always feel a &quot;hiraeth&quot;, it always comes back to you, once you step back into the place where you have atavistic memories.&quot; A year later, Williams would describe a debate in Ireland when he was told he had some nerve showing his &quot;English face in Dublin&quot;. Williams dramatically responded with a &quot;very slow take and riposted &#x27;Wanna get your facts right, dear, I&#x27;m Welsh&#x27;&quot; before rising to his feet and reciting &quot;The Bard. A Pindaric Ode&quot; by Thomas Gray. Williams noted that this performance was cut short by applause, for which he was grateful as he did not know any more of the poem. Two years before his death, Williams guest hosted the &quot;Wogan&quot; chatshow; drawing the audience&#x27;s attention to a display of red roses, Williams commented, &quot;It&#x27;s St George&#x27;s Day today and the rose is the symbol of St George, the patron saint of England. I wouldn&#x27;t know anything about it. I&#x27;m not English, I&#x27;m Welsh.&quot; before proclaiming &quot;Mymryn bach o Gymru, Cymru fydd, Cymru sydd – Cymru am byth!&quot; (&quot;A little bit of Wales, Wales will be, Wales is – Wales forever!&quot;)

==Career==
===Early career===
Williams&#x27;s professional career began in 1948 in repertory theatre. Failure to become a serious dramatic actor disappointed him, but his potential as a comic performer gave him his break when he was spotted playing the Dauphin in Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;St Joan&quot; in the West End, in 1954 by radio producer Dennis Main Wilson. Main Wilson was casting &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;, a radio series starring Tony Hancock. Playing mostly funny voice roles, Williams stayed in the series almost to the end, five years later. His nasal, whiny, camp-cockney inflections (epitomised in his &quot;Stop messing about ... !&quot; catchphrase) became popular with listeners. Despite the success and recognition the show brought him, Williams considered theatre, film and television to be superior forms of entertainment. In 1955 he appeared in Orson Welles&#x27;s London stage production &quot;Moby Dick—Rehearsed&quot;. The pair fell out after Williams became annoyed with Welles&#x27;s habit of repeatedly changing the script.

When Hancock steered his show away from what he considered gimmicks and silly voices, Williams found he had less to do. Tiring of this reduced status, he joined Kenneth Horne in &quot;Beyond Our Ken&quot; (1958–1964), and its sequel, &quot;Round the Horne&quot; (1965–1968). His roles in &quot;Round the Horne&quot; included Rambling Syd Rumpo, the eccentric folk singer; Dr Chou En Ginsberg, MA (failed), Oriental criminal mastermind; J. Peasemold Gruntfuttock, telephone heavy breather and dirty old man; and Sandy of the camp couple Julian and Sandy (Julian was played by Hugh Paddick). Their double act was characterised by double entendres and Polari, the homosexual argot.

Williams also appeared in West End revues including &quot;Share My Lettuce&quot; with Maggie Smith, written by Bamber Gascoigne, and &quot;Pieces of Eight&quot; with Fenella Fielding. The latter included material specially written for him by Peter Cook, then a student at Pembroke College, Cambridge. Cook&#x27;s &quot;One Leg Too Few&quot; and &quot;Interesting Facts&quot; were part of the show and became routines in his own performances. Williams&#x27;s last revue, in 1961, was &quot;One Over The Eight&quot; at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre, with Sheila Hancock.

===&quot;Carry On&quot; films===
Williams worked regularly in British film during the late 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, mainly in the &quot;Carry On&quot; series (1958–1978) with its double entendre humour; and appeared in the series more than any other actor. The films were commercially successful but Williams claimed the cast were poorly paid. In his diaries, Williams wrote that he earned more in a St Ivel advert than for any &quot;Carry On&quot; film, although he was still earning the average Briton&#x27;s annual salary in a year for the latter. He often privately criticised and &quot;dripped vitriol&quot; upon the films, considering them beneath him, even though he continued to appear in them. This became the case with many of the films and shows in which he appeared. He was quick to find fault with his own work, and also that of others. Despite this, he spoke fondly of the &quot;Carry On&quot;s in interviews. Peter Rogers, producer of the series, recollected, &quot;Kenneth was worth taking care of because, while he cost very little—£5,000 a film, he made a great deal of money for the franchise.&quot;

===Radio and television shows===
Williams was a regular on the BBC Radio impromptu-speaking panel game &quot;Just a Minute&quot; from its second series in 1968 until his death. He frequently got into arguments with host Nicholas Parsons and other guests on the show. (Russell Davies, editor of &quot;The Kenneth Williams Letters&quot;, explains that Williams&#x27;s &quot;famous tirades on the programme occurred when his desire to entertain was fuelled by his annoyance.&quot;) He was also remembered for such phrases as &quot;I&#x27;ve come all the way from Great Portland Street&quot; (i.e. one block away) and &quot;They shouldn&#x27;t have women on the show!&quot; (directed at Sheila Hancock, Aimi MacDonald and others). He once talked for almost a minute about a supposed Austrian psychiatrist called Heinrich Swartzberg, correctly guessing that the show&#x27;s creator, Ian Messiter, had just made the name up. Williams was also a regular on the BBC Radio comedy show &quot;Round the Horne,&quot; playing, alongside Hugh Paddick, the characters Julian and Sandy who spoke in a comedic version of Polari.

On television, he co-hosted his own TV variety series on BBC2 with the Young Generation entitled &quot;Meanwhile, On BBC2&quot;, which ran for ten episodes from 17 April 1971. He was a frequent contributor to the 1973–74 revival of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, hosted the weekly entertainment show &quot;International Cabaret&quot; and was a regular reader on the children&#x27;s storytelling series &quot;Jackanory&quot; on BBC1, hosting 69 episodes. He also narrated and provided all of the voices for the BBC children&#x27;s cartoon &quot;Willo the Wisp&quot; (1981).

In 1983, Williams was the subject of an episode of the BBC series &quot;Comic Roots&quot;, in which he revisited the places in London where he grew up and went to school.

== Personal life and death ==
On 14 October 1962, Williams&#x27; father, Charlie Williams, was taken to hospital after drinking carbon tetrachloride that had been stored in a cough-mixture bottle. He died the following day. An hour after being given the news, Williams went on stage in the West End. Williams was later denied a visa to the United States when it emerged that Scotland Yard had suspected him of poisoning his father. The coroner&#x27;s court recorded a verdict of accidental death due to corrosive poisoning by carbon tetrachloride. Williams said he believed his father had committed suicide, because the circumstances leading to the poisoning seemed unlikely to have happened by misfortune.

As a younger man, Williams was a communist, but came to move in a more conservative direction and espoused Toryism.

Williams often said that he was asexual and celibate, and his diaries appear to substantiate his claims—at least from his early forties onwards. He lived alone all his adult life and had few close companions apart from his mother, and no significant romantic relationships. His diaries contain references to unconsummated or barely consummated homosexual dalliances, which he describes as &quot;traditional matters&quot; or &quot;tradiola&quot;. He befriended gay playwright Joe Orton, who wrote the role of Inspector Truscott in &quot;Loot&quot; (1965) for him. Williams went on holidays to Morocco with Orton and his partner, Kenneth Halliwell. Other close friends included Stanley Baxter, Gordon Jackson and his wife Rona Anderson, Sheila Hancock, and Maggie Smith and her playwright husband, Beverley Cross. Williams was also fond of fellow &quot;Carry On&quot; regulars Barbara Windsor, Bernard Bresslaw, Peter Butterworth, Kenneth Connor, Hattie Jacques and Joan Sims.

From the mid-1950s, Williams lived in a succession of small rented flats in central London. After his father had died, his mother Louisa lived near him, and then in the flat next to his. His last home was in a block of flats called Marlborough House on Osnaburgh Street in Bloomsbury (since demolished).

Williams rarely revealed details of his private life although, in two half-hour documentary programmes in 1977 on BBC Radio London entitled &quot;Carry On Kenneth&quot;, he spoke openly to Owen Spencer-Thomas about his loneliness, despondency and sense of underachievement.

He died on 15 April 1988 in his flat. His last words, recorded in his diary, were &quot;Oh, what&#x27;s the bloody point?&quot; and the cause of death was an overdose of barbiturates. An inquest recorded an open verdict, because it was not possible to establish whether his death was suicide or an accident. His diaries reveal that he had often had suicidal thoughts, and some of his earliest diaries record periodic feelings that there was no point in living. His authorised biography argues that Williams did not take his own life but died of an accidental overdose. He had doubled his dosage of antacid without discussing it with his doctor. That, combined with the mixture of medication, is the widely accepted cause of death. He had a stock of painkilling tablets and it is argued that he would have taken more of them if he had been intending suicide. He was cremated at East Finchley Cemetery, and his ashes were scattered in the memorial gardens. Williams left an estate worth just under £540,000 (approximately ).

== Legacy ==
=== Diaries and biographies ===
In April 2008 Radio 4 broadcast the two-part &quot;The Pain of Laughter: The Last Days of Kenneth Williams&quot;. The programmes were researched and written by Wes Butters and narrated by Rob Brydon. Butters purchased a collection of Williams&#x27;s personal belongings from the actor&#x27;s godson, Robert Chidell, to whom they had been bequeathed.

The first of the programmes said that, towards the end of his life and struggling with depression and ill health, Williams abandoned Christianity following discussions with the poet Philip Larkin. Williams had been brought up a Wesleyan and then a Methodist, though he spent much of his life struggling with Christianity&#x27;s teachings on homosexuality.

&quot;Kenneth Williams Unseen&quot; by Wes Butters and Russell Davies, the first Williams biography in 15 years, was published by HarperCollins in October 2008.

An authorised biography, &quot;Born Brilliant: The Life of Kenneth Williams&quot;, by Christopher Stevens, was published in October 2010. This drew for the first time on the full Williams archive of diaries and letters, which had been stored in a London bank for 15 years following publication of edited extracts. The biography notes that Williams used a variety of handwriting styles and colours in his journals, switching between different hands on the page.

=== Portrayals ===
David Benson&#x27;s 1996 Edinburgh Fringe show &quot;Think No Evil of Us: My Life with Kenneth Williams&quot; saw Benson playing Williams; after touring, the show ran in London&#x27;s West End. Benson reprised his performance at the 2006 Edinburgh Fringe and continues to tour.

Williams was played by Adam Godley in Terry Johnson&#x27;s play &quot;Cleo, Camping, Emmanuelle and Dick&quot;, which premiered at the National Theatre in 1998. Godley reprised the role in the subsequent film adaptation, &quot;Cor, Blimey!&quot;

In 2006, Williams&#x27; life was the subject of the television play &quot;Kenneth Williams: Fantabulosa!&quot;. Michael Sheen portrayed Williams.

=== Recognition ===
A flat in the Osnaburgh Street block in which Williams lived from 1972 until his death was bought by Rob Brydon and Julia Davis for the writing of their comedy series &quot;Human Remains&quot;. The building was demolished in 2007.

Williams is commemorated by a blue plaque at the address of his father&#x27;s barber shop, 57 Marchmont Street, London, where he lived from 1935 to 1956. The plaque was unveiled on 11 October 2009 by Leslie Phillips, Bill Pertwee and Nicholas Parsons, with whom Williams performed.

On 22 February 2014, on what would have been Williams&#x27; 88th birthday, an English Heritage blue plaque was unveiled at Farley Court off Marylebone Road, where Williams lived between 1963 and 1970. Speaking at the ceremony, his &quot;Carry On&quot; co-star Barbara Windsor said: &quot;Kenny was a one-off, a true original&quot;.

In particle physics, a pion (, ) or pi meson, denoted with the Greek letter pi (), is any of three subatomic particles: , , and . Each pion consists of a quark and an antiquark and is therefore a meson. Pions are the lightest mesons and, more generally, the lightest hadrons. They are unstable, with the charged pions and decaying after a mean lifetime of 26.033 nanoseconds ( seconds), and the neutral pion decaying after a much shorter lifetime of 85 attoseconds ( seconds). Charged pions most often decay into muons and muon neutrinos, while neutral pions generally decay into gamma rays.

The exchange of virtual pions, along with vector, rho and omega mesons, provides an explanation for the residual strong force between nucleons. Pions are not produced in radioactive decay, but commonly are in high-energy collisions between hadrons. Pions also result from some matter–antimatter annihilation events. All types of pions are also produced in natural processes when high-energy cosmic-ray protons and other hadronic cosmic-ray components interact with matter in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. In 2013, the detection of characteristic gamma rays originating from the decay of neutral pions in two supernova remnants has shown that pions are produced copiously after supernovas, most probably in conjunction with production of high-energy protons that are detected on Earth as cosmic rays.

The pion also plays a crucial role in cosmology, by imposing an upper limit on the energies of cosmic rays surviving collisions with the cosmic microwave background, through the Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit.

== History ==
Theoretical work by Hideki Yukawa in 1935 had predicted the existence of mesons as the carrier particles of the strong nuclear force. From the range of the strong nuclear force (inferred from the radius of the atomic nucleus), Yukawa predicted the existence of a particle having a mass of about . Initially after its discovery in 1936, the muon (initially called the &quot;mu meson&quot;) was thought to be this particle, since it has a mass of . However, later experiments showed that the muon did not participate in the strong nuclear interaction. In modern terminology, this makes the muon a lepton, and not a meson. However, some communities of astrophysicists continue to call the muon a &quot;mu-meson&quot;. The pions, which turned out to be examples of Yukawa&#x27;s proposed mesons, were discovered later: the charged pions in 1947, and the neutral pion in 1950.

In 1947, the first true mesons, the charged pions, were found by the collaboration led by Cecil Powell at the University of Bristol, in England. The discovery article had four authors: César Lattes, Giuseppe Occhialini, Hugh Muirhead and Powell. Since the advent of particle accelerators had not yet come, high-energy subatomic particles were only obtainable from atmospheric cosmic rays. Photographic emulsions based on the gelatin-silver process were placed for long periods of time in sites located at high-altitude mountains, first at Pic du Midi de Bigorre in the Pyrenees, and later at Chacaltaya in the Andes Mountains, where the plates were struck by cosmic rays.
After development, the photographic plates were inspected under a microscope by a team of about a dozen women. Marietta Kurz was the first person to detect the unusual &quot;double meson&quot; tracks, characteristic for a pion decaying into a muon, but they were too close to the edge of the photographic emulsion and deemed incomplete. A few days later, Irene Roberts observed the tracks left by pion decay that appeared in the discovery paper. Both women are credited in the figure captions in the article.

In 1948, Lattes, Eugene Gardner, and their team first artificially produced pions at the University of California&#x27;s cyclotron in Berkeley, California, by bombarding carbon atoms with high-speed alpha particles. Further advanced theoretical work was carried out by Riazuddin, who in 1959 used the dispersion relation for Compton scattering of virtual photons on pions to analyze their charge radius.

Since the neutral pion is not electrically charged, it is more difficult to detect and observe than the charged pions are. Neutral pions do not leave tracks in photographic emulsions or Wilson cloud chambers. The existence of the neutral pion was inferred from observing its decay products from cosmic rays, a so-called &quot;soft component&quot; of slow electrons with photons. The was identified definitively at the University of California&#x27;s cyclotron in 1949 by observing its decay into two photons. Later in the same year, they were also observed in cosmic-ray balloon experiments at Bristol University.

== Possible applications ==
The use of pions in medical radiation therapy, such as for cancer, was explored at a number of research institutions, including the Los Alamos National Laboratory&#x27;s Meson Physics Facility, which treated 228 patients between 1974 and 1981 in New Mexico, and the TRIUMF laboratory in Vancouver, British Columbia.

== Theoretical overview ==
In the standard understanding of the strong force interaction as defined by quantum chromodynamics, pions are loosely portrayed as Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry. That explains why the masses of the three kinds of pions are considerably less than that of the other mesons, such as the scalar or vector mesons. If their current quarks were massless particles, it could make the chiral symmetry exact and thus the Goldstone theorem would dictate that all pions have a zero mass.

In fact, it was shown by Gell-Mann, Oakes and Renner (GMOR) that the square of the pion mass is proportional to the sum of the quark masses times the quark condensate: 
formula_1 
with the quark condensate: 
formula_2 
This is often known as the GMOR relation and it explicitly shows that formula_3 in the massless quark limit. The same result also follows from Light-front holography.

Empirically, since the light quarks actually have minuscule nonzero masses, the pions also have nonzero rest masses. However, those masses are &quot;almost an order of magnitude smaller&quot; than that of the nucleons, roughly formula_4 45 MeV, where are the relevant current-quark masses in MeV, around 5−10 MeV.

The pion is one of the particles that mediate the residual strong interaction between a pair of nucleons. This interaction is attractive: it pulls the nucleons together. Written in a non-relativistic form, it is called the Yukawa potential. The pion, being spinless, has kinematics described by the Klein–Gordon equation. In the terms of quantum field theory, the effective field theory Lagrangian describing the pion-nucleon interaction is called the Yukawa interaction.

The nearly identical masses of and indicate that there must be a symmetry at play: this symmetry is called the SU(2) flavour symmetry or isospin. The reason that there are three pions, , and , is that these are understood to belong to the triplet representation or the adjoint representation 3 of SU(2). By contrast, the up and down quarks transform according to the fundamental representation 2 of SU(2), whereas the anti-quarks transform according to the conjugate representation 2*.

With the addition of the strange quark, the pions participate in a larger, SU(3), flavour symmetry, in the adjoint representation, 8, of SU(3). The other members of this octet are the four kaons and the eta meson.

Pions are pseudoscalars under a parity transformation. Pion currents thus couple to the axial vector current and so participate in the chiral anomaly.

== Basic properties ==
Pions, which are mesons with zero spin, are composed of first-generation quarks. In the quark model, an up quark and an anti-down quark make up a , whereas a down quark and an anti-up quark make up the , and these are the antiparticles of one another. The neutral pion is a combination of an up quark with an anti-up quark, or a down quark with an anti-down quark. The two combinations have identical quantum numbers, and hence they are only found in superpositions. The lowest-energy superposition of these is the , which is its own antiparticle. Together, the pions form a triplet of isospin. Each pion has overall isospin () and third-component isospin equal to its charge ().

=== Charged pion decays ===
The mesons have a mass of and a mean lifetime of . They decay due to the weak interaction. The primary decay mode of a pion, with a branching fraction of 0.999877, is a leptonic decay into a muon and a muon neutrino:

formula_5

The second most common decay mode of a pion, with a branching fraction of 0.000123, is also a leptonic decay into an electron and the corresponding electron antineutrino. This &quot;electronic mode&quot; was discovered at CERN in 1958:

formula_6

The suppression of the electronic decay mode with respect to the muonic one is given approximately (up to a few percent effect of the radiative corrections) by the ratio of the half-widths of the pion–electron and the pion–muon decay reactions,

formula_7

and is a spin effect known as helicity suppression.

Its mechanism is as follows: The negative pion has spin zero; therefore the lepton and the antineutrino must be emitted with opposite spins (and opposite linear momenta) to preserve net zero spin (and conserve linear momentum). However, because the weak interaction is sensitive only to the left chirality component of fields, the antineutrino has always left chirality, which means it is right-handed, since for massless anti-particles the helicity is opposite to the chirality. This implies that the lepton must be emitted with spin in the direction of its linear momentum (i.e., also right-handed). If, however, leptons were massless, they would only interact with the pion in the left-handed form (because for massless particles helicity is the same as chirality) and this decay mode would be prohibited. Therefore, suppression of the electron decay channel comes from the fact that the electron&#x27;s mass is much smaller than the muon&#x27;s. The electron is relatively massless compared with the muon, and thus the electronic mode is greatly suppressed relative to the muonic one, virtually prohibited.

Although this explanation suggests that parity violation is causing the helicity suppression, the fundamental reason lies in the vector-nature of the interaction which dictates a different handedness for the neutrino and the charged lepton. Thus, even a parity conserving interaction would yield the same suppression.

Measurements of the above ratio have been considered for decades to be a test of lepton universality. Experimentally, this ratio is .

Beyond the purely leptonic decays of pions, some structure-dependent radiative leptonic decays (that is, decay to the usual leptons plus a gamma ray) have also been observed.

Also observed, for charged pions only, is the very rare &quot;pion beta decay&quot; (with branching fraction of about ) into a neutral pion, an electron and an electron antineutrino (or for positive pions, a neutral pion, a positron, and electron neutrino).

formula_8

The rate at which pions decay is a prominent quantity in many sub-fields of particle physics, such as chiral perturbation theory. This rate is parametrized by the pion decay constant (), related to the wave function overlap of the quark and antiquark, which is about .

=== Neutral pion decays ===
The meson has a mass of and a mean lifetime of . It decays via the electromagnetic force, which explains why its mean lifetime is much smaller than that of the charged pion (which can only decay via the weak force). 

The dominant decay mode, with a branching ratio of , is into two photons:

formula_9

The decay (as well as decays into any odd number of photons) is forbidden by the C-symmetry of the electromagnetic interaction: The intrinsic C-parity of the is +1, while the C-parity of a system of photons is .

The second largest decay mode () is the Dalitz decay (named after Richard Dalitz), which is a two-photon decay with an internal photon conversion resulting in a photon and an electron-positron pair in the final state:

formula_10

The third largest established decay mode () is the double-Dalitz decay, with both photons undergoing internal conversion which leads to further suppression of the rate:

formula_11

The fourth largest established decay mode is the loop-induced and therefore suppressed (and additionally helicity-suppressed) leptonic decay mode ():

formula_12

The neutral pion has also been observed to decay into positronium with a branching fraction on the order of . No other decay modes have been established experimentally. The branching fractions above are the PDG central values, and their uncertainties are omitted, but available in the cited publication.

<doc id="36968" wikidata="Q192628" url="?curid=36968" title="Beef">
<text>Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle (&quot;Bos taurus&quot;). Beef can be prepared in various ways; cuts are often used for steak, which can be cooked to varying degrees of doneness, while trimmings are often ground or minced, as found in most hamburgers. Beef contains protein, iron, and vitamin B12. Along with other kinds of red meat, high consumption is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer and coronary heart disease, especially when processed. Beef has a high environmental impact, being a primary driver of deforestation with the highest greenhouse gas emissions of any agricultural product.

In prehistoric times, humankind hunted aurochs and later domesticated them. Since that time, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred specifically for the quality or quantity of their meat. Today, beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, after pork and poultry. As of 2018, the United States, Brazil, and China were the largest producers of beef.

Some religions and cultures prohibit beef consumption, especially Indian religions like Hinduism. Buddhists are also against animal slaughtering, but they do not have a wrongful eating doctrine.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;beef&quot; is from the Latin word &quot;bōs&quot;, in contrast to &quot;cow&quot; which is from Middle English &quot;cou&quot; (both words have the same Indo-European root &quot;&quot;). 

This is one example of the common English dichotomy between the words for animals (with largely Germanic origins) and their meat (with Romanic origins) that is also found in such English word-pairs as &quot;pig/pork&quot;, &quot;deer/venison&quot;, &quot;sheep/mutton&quot;, and &quot;chicken/poultry&quot; (also the less common &quot;goat/chevon&quot;). &quot;Beef&quot; is cognate with &quot;bovine&quot; through the Late Latin &quot;bovīnus&quot;. The rarely used plural form of beef is &quot;beeves&quot;.

== History ==
People have eaten the flesh of bovines since prehistoric times; some of the earliest known cave paintings, such as those of Lascaux, show aurochs in hunting scenes. People domesticated cattle to provide ready access to beef, milk, and leather. Cattle have been domesticated at least twice over the course of evolutionary history. The first domestication event occurred around 10,500 years ago with the evolution of &quot;Bos taurus&quot;. The second was more recent, around 7,000 years ago, with the evolution of &quot;Bos indicus&quot; in the Indian subcontinent. There is a possible third domestication event 8,500 years ago, with a potential third species &quot;Bos africanus&quot; arising in Africa.

In the United States, the growth of the beef business was largely due to expansion in the Southwest. Upon the acquisition of grasslands through the Mexican–American War of 1848, and later the expulsion of the Plains Indians from this region and the Midwest, the American livestock industry began, starting primarily with the taming of feral and semi-feral Longhorn cattle. Chicago and New York City were the first to benefit from these developments in their stockyards and in their meat markets.

== Production ==

Beef cattle are raised and fed using a variety of methods, including feedlots, free range, ranching, backgrounding and intensive animal farming. Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs), commonly referred to as factory farms, are commonly used to meet the demand of beef production. CAFOs supply 70.4% of cows in the US market and 99% of all meat in the United States supply. Cattle CAFOs can also be a source of &quot;E. coli&quot; contamination in the food supply due to the prevalence of manure in CAFOs. These &quot;E. coli&quot; contaminations include one strain, &quot;E. coli&quot; O157:H7, which can be toxic to humans, because cattle typically hold this strain in their digestive system. Another consequence of unsanitary conditions created by high-density confinement systems is increased use of antibiotics in order to prevent illness. An analysis of FDA sales data by the Natural Resources Defense Council found 42% of medically important antibiotic use in the U.S. was on cattle, posing concerns about the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria. In 2023 production was forecast to peak by 2035.

=== Environmental impact ===


The consumption of beef poses numerous threats to the natural environment. Of all agricultural products, beef requires some of the most land and water, and its production results in the greatest amount of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), air pollution, and water pollution. A 2021 study added up GHG emissions from the entire lifecycle, including production, transportation, and consumption, and estimated that beef contributed about 4 billion tonnes (9%) of anthropogenic greenhouse gases in 2010. Cattle populations graze around 26% of all land on Earth, not including the large agricultural fields that are used to grow cattle feed. According to FAO, &quot;Ranching-induced deforestation is one of the main causes of loss of some unique plant and animal species in the tropical rainforests of Central and South America as well as carbon release in the atmosphere.&quot; Beef is also the primary driver of deforestation in the Amazon, with around 80% of all converted land being used to rear cattle. 91% of Amazon land deforested since 1970 has been converted to cattle ranching. 41% of global deforestation from 2005 to 2013 has been attributed to the expansion of beef production. This is due to the higher ratio of net energy of gain to net energy of maintenance where metabolizable energy intake is higher. The ratio of feed required to produce an equivalent amount of beef (live weight) has been estimated at 7:1 to 43:1, compared with about 2:1 for chicken. However, assumptions about feed quality are implicit in such generalizations. For example, production of a kilogram of beef cattle live weight may require between 4 and 5 kilograms of feed high in protein and metabolizable energy content, or more than 20 kilograms of feed of much lower quality. A simple exchange of beef to soy beans (a common feed source for cattle) in Americans&#x27; diets would, according to one estimate, result in meeting between 46 and 74 percent of the reductions needed to meet the 2020 greenhouse gas emission goals of the United States as pledged in 2009. A 2021 CSIRO trial concluded that feeding cattle a 3% diet of the seaweed &quot;Asparagopsis taxiformis&quot; could reduce the methane component of their emissions by 80%. While such feed options are still experimental, even when looking at the most widely used feeds around the globe, there is high variability in efficiency. One study found that shifting compositions of current feeds, production areas, and informed land restoration could enable greenhouse gas emissions reductions of 34–85% annually (612–1,506 MtCO2e yr−1) without increasing costs to global beef production.

Some scientists claim that the demand for beef is contributing to significant biodiversity loss as it is a significant driver of deforestation and habitat destruction; species-rich habitats, such as significant portions of the Amazon region, are being converted to agriculture for meat production. The 2019 IPBES &quot;Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services&quot; also concurs that the beef industry plays a significant role in biodiversity loss. Around 25% to nearly 40% of global land surface is being used for livestock farming, which is mostly cattle.

Some kinds of beef may receive special certifications or designations based on criteria including their breed (Certified Angus Beef, Certified Hereford Beef), origin (Kobe beef, Carne de Ávila, Belgian Blue), or the way the cattle are treated, fed or slaughtered (organic, grass-fed, Kosher, or Halal beef). Some countries regulate the marketing and sale of beef by observing criteria post-slaughter and classifying the observed quality of the meat.

===Global statistics===

In 2018, the United States, Brazil, and China produced the most beef with 12.22 million tons, 9.9 million tons, and 6.46 million tons respectively. The top 3 beef exporting countries in 2019 were Australia (14.8% of total exports), the United States (13.4% of total exports), and Brazil (12.6% of total exports). Beef production is also important to the economies of Japan, Argentina, Uruguay, Canada, Paraguay, Mexico, Belarus and Nicaragua.

====Top 5 cattle and beef exporting countries====
As per 2020, Brazil was the largest beef exporter in the world followed by Australia, United States, India (Includes Carabeef only) and Argentina. Brazil, Australia, the United States and India accounted for roughly 61% of the world&#x27;s beef exports.
====Top 10 cattle and beef producing countries====
The world produced 60.57 million metric tons of beef in 2020, down 950K metric tons from the prior year. Major decline for production of beef was from India up to 510k and Australia down to 309K metric tons from the prior year.

==Preparation==
=== Cuts ===

Most beef can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.), while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, which are usually mixed with meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties called blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred to as mad cow disease), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United States as &quot;calf fries&quot;, &quot;prairie oysters&quot;, or &quot;Rocky Mountain oysters&quot;). Some intestines are cooked and eaten as is, but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The bones are used for making beef stock. Meat from younger cows (calves) is called veal. Beef from steers and heifers is similar.

Beef is first divided into primal cuts, large pieces of the animal initially separated by butchering. These are basic sections from which steaks and other subdivisions are cut. The term &quot;primal cut&quot; is quite different from &quot;prime cut&quot;, used to characterize cuts considered to be of higher quality. Since the animal&#x27;s legs and neck muscles do the most work, they are the toughest; the meat becomes more tender as distance from &quot;hoof and horn&quot; increases. Different countries and cuisines have different cuts and names, and sometimes use the same name for a different cut; for example, the cut described as &quot;brisket&quot; in the United States is from a significantly different part of the carcass than British brisket.

=== Aging and tenderization ===

To improve tenderness of beef, it is often aged (i.e., stored refrigerated) to allow endogenous proteolytic enzymes to weaken structural and myofibrillar proteins. Wet aging is accomplished using vacuum packaging to reduce spoilage and yield loss. Dry aging involves hanging primals (usually ribs or loins) in humidity-controlled coolers. Outer surfaces dry out and can support growth of molds (and spoilage bacteria, if too humid), resulting in trim and evaporative losses.

Evaporation concentrates the remaining proteins and increases flavor intensity; the molds can contribute a nut-like flavor. After two to three days there are significant effects. The majority of the tenderizing effect occurs in the first 10 days. Boxed beef, stored and distributed in vacuum packaging, is, in effect, wet aged during distribution. Premium steakhouses dry age for 21 to 28 days or wet age up to 45 days for maximum effect on flavor and tenderness.

Meat from less tender cuts or older cattle can be mechanically tenderized by forcing small, sharp blades through the cuts to disrupt the proteins. Also, solutions of exogenous proteolytic enzymes (papain, bromelin or ficin) can be applied or injected to augment the endogenous enzymes; this can be done with purified enzyme or by using a marinade including ingredients that naturally contain the enzyme (e.g. papaya for papain or pineapple for bromelin). Similarly, solutions of salt and sodium phosphates can be injected to soften and swell the myofibrillar proteins. This improves juiciness and tenderness. Salt can improve the flavor, but phosphate can contribute a soapy flavor.

=== Cooking methods ===

These methods are applicable to all types of meat and some other foodstuffs.

==== Dry heat ====


===== Internal temperature =====
Beef can be cooked to various degrees, from very rare to well done. The degree of cooking corresponds to the temperature in the approximate center of the meat, which can be measured with a meat thermometer. Beef can be cooked using the sous-vide method, which cooks the entire steak to the same temperature, but when cooked using a method such as broiling or roasting it is typically cooked such that it has a &quot;bulls eye&quot; of doneness, with the least done (coolest) at the center and the most done (warmest) at the outside.

==== Frying ====
Meat can be cooked in boiling oil, typically by shallow frying, although deep frying may be used, often for meat enrobed with breadcrumbs as in milanesas or finger steaks. Larger pieces such as steaks may be cooked this way, or meat may be cut smaller as in stir frying, typically an Asian way of cooking: cooking oil with flavorings such as garlic, ginger and onions is put in a very hot wok. Then small pieces of meat are added, followed by ingredients which cook more quickly, such as mixed vegetables. The dish is ready when the ingredients are &#x27;just cooked&#x27;.

==== Moist heat ====
Moist heat cooking methods include braising, pot roasting, stewing and sous-vide. These techniques are often used for cuts of beef that are tougher, as these longer, lower-temperature cooking methods have time to dissolve connecting tissue which otherwise makes meat remain tough after cooking.
* Stewing or simmering
:simmering meat, whole or cut into bite-size pieces, in a water-based liquid with flavorings. This technique may be used as part of pressure cooking.
* Braising
:cooking meats, in a covered container, with small amounts of liquids (usually seasoned or flavored). Unlike stewing, braised meat is not fully immersed in liquid, and usually is browned before the oven step.
* Sous-vide
:Sous-vide, French for &quot;under vacuum&quot;, is a method of cooking food sealed in airtight plastic bags in a water bath for a long time—72 hours is not unknown—at an accurately determined temperature much lower than normally used for other types of cooking. The intention is to maintain the integrity of ingredients and achieve very precise control of cooking. Although water is used in the method, only moisture in or added to the food bags is in contact with the food.
Meat has usually been cooked in water which is just simmering, such as in stewing; higher temperatures make meat tougher by causing the proteins to contract. Since thermostatic temperature control became available, cooking at temperatures well below boiling, (sous-vide) to (slow cooking), for prolonged periods has become possible; this is just hot enough to convert the tough collagen in connective tissue into gelatin through hydrolysis, with minimal toughening.

With the adequate combination of temperature and cooking time, pathogens, such as bacteria will be killed, and pasteurization can be achieved. Because browning (Maillard reactions) can only occur at higher temperatures (above the boiling point of water), these moist techniques do not develop the flavors associated with browning. Meat will often undergo searing in a very hot pan, grilling or browning with a torch before moist cooking (though sometimes after).

Thermostatically controlled methods, such as sous-vide, can also prevent overcooking by bringing the meat to the exact degree of doneness desired, and holding it at that temperature indefinitely. The combination of precise temperature control and long cooking duration makes it possible to be assured that pasteurization has been achieved, both on the surface and the interior of even very thick cuts of meat, which can not be assured with most other cooking techniques. (Although extremely long-duration cooking can break down the texture of the meat to an undesirable degree.)

Beef can be cooked quickly at the table through several techniques. In hot pot cooking, such as shabu-shabu, very thinly sliced meat is cooked by the diners at the table by immersing it in a heated pot of water or stock with vegetables. In fondue bourguignonne, diners dip small pieces of beef into a pot of hot oil at the table. Both techniques typically feature accompanying flavorful sauces to complement the meat.

==== Raw beef ====
Steak tartare is a French dish made from finely chopped or ground (minced) raw meat (often beef). More accurately, it is scraped so as not to let even the slightest of the sinew fat get into the scraped meat. It is often served with onions, capers, seasonings such as fresh ground pepper and Worcestershire sauce, and sometimes raw egg yolk.

The Belgian or Dutch dish &quot;filet américain&quot; is also made of finely chopped ground beef, though it is seasoned differently, and either eaten as a main dish or can be used as a dressing for a sandwich. &quot;Kibbeh nayyeh&quot; is a similar Lebanese and Syrian dish. And in Ethiopia, a ground raw meat dish called &quot;tire siga&quot; or &quot;kitfo&quot; is eaten (upon availability).

&quot;Carpaccio&quot; of beef is a thin slice of raw beef dressed with olive oil, lemon juice and seasoning. Often, the beef is partially frozen before slicing to allow very thin slices to be cut.

&quot;Yukhoe&quot; is a variety of &quot;hoe&quot;, raw dishes in Korean cuisine which is usually made from raw ground beef seasoned with various spices or sauces. The beef part used for &quot;yukhoe&quot; is tender rump steak. For the seasoning, soy sauce, sugar, salt, sesame oil, green onion, and ground garlic, sesame seed, black pepper and juice of &quot;bae&quot; (Korean pear) are used. The beef is mostly topped with the yolk of a raw egg.

==== Cured, smoked, and dried beef ====

&quot;Bresaola&quot; is an air-dried, salted beef that has been aged about two to three months until it becomes hard and a dark red, almost purple, colour. It is lean, has a sweet, musty smell and is tender. It originated in Valtellina, a valley in the Alps of northern Italy&#x27;s Lombardy region. Bündnerfleisch is a similar product from neighbouring Switzerland. Chipped beef is an American industrially produced air-dried beef product, described by one of its manufacturers as being &quot;similar to bresaola, but not as tasty.&quot;

Beef jerky is dried, salted, smoked beef popular in the United States.

Biltong is a cured, salted, air dried beef popular in South Africa.

Pastrami is often made from beef; raw beef is salted, then partly dried and seasoned with various herbs and spices, and smoked.

Corned beef is a cut of beef cured or pickled in a seasoned brine. The corn in &quot;corned beef&quot; refers to the grains of coarse salts (known as corns) used to cure it. The term &quot;corned beef&quot; can denote different styles of brine-cured beef, depending on the region. Some, like American-style corned beef, are highly seasoned and often considered delicatessen fare.

Spiced beef is a cured and salted joint of round, topside, or silverside, traditionally served at Christmas in Ireland. It is a form of salt beef, cured with spices and saltpetre, intended to be boiled or broiled in Guinness or a similar stout, and then optionally roasted for a period after. There are various other recipes for pickled beef. Sauerbraten is a German variant.

== Consumption ==
Beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, accounting for about 25% of meat production worldwide, after pork and poultry at 38% and 30% respectively.

=== Nutritional content ===

Beef is a source of complete protein and it is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of niacin, vitamin B12, iron and zinc, but also contains high amounts of saturated fat. Red meat is the most significant dietary source of carnitine and, like any other meat (pork, fish, veal, lamb etc.), is a source of creatine. Creatine is converted to creatinine during cooking.

=== Health impact ===
====Cancer====
Consumption of red meat, and especially processed red meat, is known to increase the risk of bowel cancer and some other cancers.

====Coronary heart disease====
A 2010 meta-analysis found that processed red meat (and all processed meat) was correlated with a higher risk of coronary heart disease, although based on studies that separated the two, this meta-analysis found that red meat intake was not associated with higher incidence of coronary heart disease. As of 2020, there is substantial evidence for a link between high consumption of red meat and coronary heart disease.

====Dioxins====
Some cattle raised in the United States feed on pastures fertilized with sewage sludge. Elevated dioxins may be present in meat from these cattle.

==== &quot;E. coli&quot; recalls ====
Ground beef has been subject to recalls in the United States, due to &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; (&quot;E. coli&quot;) contamination:
* January 2011, One Great Burger expands recall.
* February 2011, American Food Service, a Pico Rivera, Calif. establishment, is recalling approximately of fresh ground beef patties and other bulk packages of ground beef products that may be contaminated with &quot;E. coli&quot; O157:H7.
* March 2011, beef recalled by Creekstone Farms Premium Beef due to &quot;E. coli&quot; concerns.
* April 2011, National Beef Packaging recalled more than of ground beef due to &quot;E. coli&quot; contamination.
* May 2011, Irish Hills Meat Company of Michigan, a Tipton, Mich., establishment is recalling approximately of ground beef products that may be contaminated with &quot;E. coli&quot; O157:H7.
* September 2011, Tyson Fresh Meats recalled of ground beef due to &quot;E. coli&quot; contamination.
* December 2011, Tyson Fresh Meats recalled of ground beef due to &quot;E. coli&quot; contamination.
* January 2012, Hannaford Supermarkets recalled all ground beef with sell by dates 17 December 2011 or earlier.
* September 2012, XL Foods recalled more than 1800 products believed to be contaminated with &quot;E. coli&quot; 0157:H7. The recalled products were produced at the company&#x27;s plant in Brooks, Alberta, Canada; this was the largest recall of its kind in Canadian History.

==== Mad cow disease ====

In 1984, the use of meat and bone meal in cattle feed resulted in the world&#x27;s first outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or, colloquially, mad cow disease) in the United Kingdom.

Since then, other countries have had outbreaks of BSE:
* In May 2003, after a cow with BSE was discovered in Alberta, Canada, the American border was closed to live Canadian cattle, but was reopened in early 2005.
* In June 2005, Dr. John Clifford, chief veterinary officer for the United States Department of Agriculture animal health inspection service, confirmed a fully domestic case of BSE in Texas. Clifford would not identify the ranch, calling that &quot;privileged information.&quot; The 12-year-old animal was alive at the time when Oprah Winfrey raised concerns about cannibalistic feeding practices on her show which aired 16 April 1996.

In 2010, the EU, through the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), proposed a roadmap to gradually lift the restrictions on the feed ban. In 2013, the ban on feeding mammal-based products to cattle, was amended to allow for certain milk, fish, eggs, and plant-fed farm animal products to be used.

==Restrictions==
=== Religious and cultural prohibitions ===
Most Indic religions reject the killing and eating of cows. Hinduism prohibits cow beef known as &quot;Go-Maans&quot; in Hindi. Bovines have a sacred status in India especially the cow, due to their provision of sustenance for families. Bovines are generally considered to be integral to the landscape. However, they do not consider the cow to be a god.

Many of India&#x27;s rural economies depend on cattle farming; hence they have been revered in society. Since the Vedic period, cattle, especially cows, were venerated as a source of milk, and dairy products, and their relative importance in transport services and farming like ploughing, row planting, ridging. Veneration grew with the advent of Jainism and the Gupta period. In medieval India, Maharaja Ranjit Singh issued a proclamation on stopping cow slaughter. Conflicts over cow slaughter often have sparked religious riots that have led to loss of human life and in one 1893 riot alone, more than 100 people were killed for the cause.

For religious reasons, the ancient Egyptian priests also refrained from consuming beef. Buddhists and Sikhs are also against wrongful slaughtering of animals, but they do not have a wrongful eating doctrine.

In ancient China, the killing of cattle and consumption of beef was prohibited, as they were valued for their role in agriculture. This custom is still followed by a few Chinese families across the world.

During the season of Lent, Orthodox Christians and Catholics periodically give up meat and poultry (and sometimes dairy products and eggs) as a religious act. Observant Jews and Muslims may not eat any meat or poultry which has not been slaughtered and treated in conformance with religious laws.

=== Legal prohibition ===

==== India ====

Most of the North Indian states prohibit the killing of cow and consumption of beef for religious reasons. Certain Hindu castes and sects continue to avoid beef from their diets. Article 48 of the Constitution of India mandates the state may take steps for preserving and improving the bovine breeds, and prohibit the slaughter, of cows and calves and other milch and draught cattle. Article 47 of the Constitution of India provides states must raise the level of nutrition and the standard of living and to improve public health as among its primary duties, based on this a reasonableness in slaughter of common cattle was instituted, if the animals ceased to be capable of breeding, providing milk, or serving as draught animals. The overall mismanagement of India&#x27;s common cattle is dubbed in academic fields as &quot;India&#x27;s bovine burden.&quot; 

In 2017, a rule against the slaughter of cattle and the eating of beef was signed into law by presidential assent as a modified version of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. The original act, however, did permit the humane slaughter of animals for use as food. Existing meat export policy in India prohibits the export of beef (meat of cow, oxen and calf). Bone-in meat, a carcass, or half carcass of buffalo is also prohibited from export. Only the boneless meat of buffalo, meat of goat and sheep and birds is permitted for export. In 2017, India sought a total &quot;beef ban&quot; and Australian market analysts predicted that this would create market opportunities for leather traders and meat producers there and elsewhere. Their prediction estimated a twenty percent shortage of beef and a thirteen percent shortage of leather in the world market.

==== Nepal ====

The cow is the national animal of Nepal, and slaughter of cattle is prohibited by law.

==== Cuba ====
In 2003, Cuba banned cow slaughter due to severe shortage of milk and milk products. On 14 April 2021, the ban was loosened, allowing ranchers to do as they wish as long as state quotas were met and the health of the herd could be ensured.

<doc id="36969" wikidata="Q7802" url="?curid=36969" title="Bread">
<text>Bread is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour (usually wheat) and water, usually by baking. Throughout recorded history and around the world, it has been an important part of many cultures&#x27; diets. It is one of the oldest human-made foods, having been of significance since the dawn of agriculture, and plays an essential role in both religious rituals and secular culture.

Bread may be leavened by naturally occurring microbes (e.g. sourdough), chemicals (e.g. baking soda), industrially produced yeast, or high-pressure aeration, which creates the gas bubbles that fluff up bread. In many countries, commercial bread often contains additives to improve flavor, texture, color, shelf life, nutrition, and ease of production.

==Etymology==
The Old English word for bread was ( in Gothic: modern English &quot;loaf&quot;) which appears to be the oldest Teutonic name. Old High German and modern German derive from this Proto-Germanic word, which was borrowed into some Slavic (, , Russian: ) and Finnic (, ) languages as well.
The Middle and Modern English word bread appears in other Germanic languages, such as , , , , and Norwegian and ; it may be related to &quot;brew&quot; or perhaps to &quot;break&quot;, originally meaning &quot;broken piece&quot;, &quot;morsel&quot;.

==History==
Bread is one of the oldest prepared foods. Evidence from 30,000 years ago in Europe and Australia revealed starch residue on rocks used for pounding plants. It is possible that during this time, starch extract from the roots of plants, such as cattails and ferns, was spread on a flat rock, placed over a fire and cooked into a primitive form of flatbread. The oldest evidence of bread-making has been found in a 14,500-year-old Natufian site in Jordan&#x27;s northeastern desert. Around 10,000 BC, with the dawn of the Neolithic age and the spread of agriculture, grains became the mainstay of making bread. Yeast spores are ubiquitous, including on the surface of cereal grains, so any dough left to rest leavens naturally.
An early leavened bread was baked as early as 6000 BC in southern Mesopotamia, cradle of the Sumerian civilization, who may have passed on the knowledge to the Egyptians around 3000 BC. The Egyptians refined the process and started adding yeast to the flour. The Sumerians were already using ash to supplement the dough as it was baked.

There were multiple sources of leavening available for early bread. Airborne yeasts could be harnessed by leaving uncooked dough exposed to air for some time before cooking. Pliny the Elder reported that the Gauls and Iberians used the foam skimmed from beer, called barm, to produce &quot;a lighter kind of bread than other peoples&quot; such as barm cake. Parts of the ancient world that drank wine instead of beer used a paste composed of grape juice and flour that was allowed to begin fermenting, or wheat bran steeped in wine, as a source for yeast. The most common source of leavening was to retain a piece of dough from the previous day to use as a form of sourdough starter, as Pliny also reported.

The ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans all considered the degree of refinement in the bakery arts as a sign of civilization.

The Chorleywood bread process was developed in 1961; it uses the intense mechanical working of dough to dramatically reduce the fermentation period and the time taken to produce a loaf. The process, whose high-energy mixing allows for the use of grain with a lower protein content, is now widely used around the world in large factories. As a result, bread can be produced very quickly and at low costs to the manufacturer and the consumer. However, there has been some criticism of the effect on nutritional value.

==Types==
Bread is the staple food of the Middle East, Central Asia, North Africa, Europe, and in European-derived cultures such as those in the Americas, Australia, and Southern Africa. This is in contrast to parts of South and East Asia, where rice or noodles are the staple. Bread is usually made from a wheat-flour dough that is cultured with yeast, allowed to rise, and baked in an oven. Carbon dioxide and ethanol vapors produced during yeast fermentation result in bread&#x27;s air pockets. Owing to its high levels of gluten (which give the dough sponginess and elasticity), common or bread wheat is the most common grain used for the preparation of bread, which makes the largest single contribution to the world&#x27;s food supply of any food.

Bread is also made from the flour of other wheat species (including spelt, emmer, einkorn and kamut). Non-wheat cereals including rye, barley, maize (corn), oats, sorghum, millet and rice have been used to make bread, but, with the exception of rye, usually in combination with wheat flour as they have less gluten.

Gluten-free breads are made using flours from a variety of ingredients such as almonds, rice, sorghum, corn, legumes such as beans, and tubers such as cassava. Since these foods lack gluten, dough made from them may not hold its shape as the loaves rise, and their crumb may be dense with little aeration. Additives such as xanthan gum, guar gum, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), corn starch, or eggs are used to compensate for the lack of gluten.


==Properties==
===Physical-chemical composition===
In wheat, phenolic compounds are mainly found in hulls in the form of insoluble bound ferulic acid, where it is relevant to wheat resistance to fungal diseases.

Rye bread contains phenolic acids and ferulic acid dehydrodimers.

Three natural phenolic glucosides, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, p-coumaric acid glucoside and ferulic acid glucoside, can be found in commercial breads containing flaxseed.

Glutenin and gliadin are functional proteins found in wheat bread that contribute to the structure of bread. Glutenin forms interconnected gluten networks within bread through interchain disulfide bonds. Gliadin binds weakly to the gluten network established by glutenin via intrachain disulfide bonds. Structurally, bread can be defined as an elastic-plastic foam (same as styrofoam). The glutenin protein contributes to its elastic nature, as it is able to regain its initial shape after deformation. The gliadin protein contributes to its plastic nature, because it demonstrates non-reversible structural change after a certain amount of applied force. Because air pockets within this gluten network result from carbon dioxide production during leavening, bread can be defined as a foam, or a gas-in-solid solution.

Acrylamide, like in other starchy foods that have been heated higher than 120 °C (248 °F), has been found in recent years to occur in bread. Acrylamide is neurotoxic, has adverse effects on male reproduction and developmental toxicity and is carcinogenic. A study has found that more than 99 percent of the acrylamide in bread is found in the crust.

A study by the University of Hohenheim found that industrially produced bread typically has a high proportion of FODMAP carbohydrates due to a short rising time (often only one hour). The high proportion of FODMAP carbohydrates in such bread then causes flatulence. This is particularly problematic in intestinal diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome. While in traditional bread making the dough rises for several hours, industrial breads rise for a much shorter time, usually only one hour. However, a sufficiently long rising time is important to break down the indigestible FODMAP carbohydrates. Some flours (for example, spelt, emmer and einkorn) contain fewer FODMAPs, but the difference between grain types is relatively small (between 1 and 2 percent by weight). Instead, 90% of the FODMAPs that cause discomfort can be broken down during a rising time of four hours. In the study, whole-grain yeast doughs were examined after different rising times; the highest level of FODMAPs was present after one hour in each case and decreased thereafter. The study thus shows that it is essentially the baking technique and not the type of grain that determines whether a bread is well tolerated or not. A better tolerance of bread made from original cereals can therefore not be explained by the original cereal itself, but rather by the fact that traditional, artisanal baking techniques are generally used when baking original cereals, which include a long dough process. The study also showed that a long rising time also breaks down undesirable phytates more effectively, flavors develop better, and the finished bread contains more biologically accessible trace elements.

===Culinary uses===
Bread can be served at many temperatures; once baked, it can subsequently be toasted. It is most commonly eaten with the hands, either by itself or as a carrier for other foods. Bread can be spread with butter, dipped into liquids such as gravy, olive oil, or soup; it can be topped with various sweet and savory spreads, or used to make sandwiches containing meats, cheeses, vegetables, and condiments.

Bread is used as an ingredient in other culinary preparations, such as the use of breadcrumbs to provide crunchy crusts or thicken sauces; toasted cubes of bread, called croutons, are used as a salad topping; seasoned bread is used as stuffing inside roasted turkey; sweet or savoury bread puddings are made with bread and various liquids; egg and milk-soaked bread is fried as French toast; and bread is used as a binding agent in sausages, meatballs and other ground meat products.

===Nutritional significance===
Bread is a good source of carbohydrates and micronutrients such as magnesium, iron, selenium, and B vitamins. Whole grain bread is a good source of dietary fiber and all breads are a common source of protein in the diet, though not a rich one.

===Crust===
Bread crust is formed from surface dough during the cooking process. It is hardened and browned through the Maillard reaction using the sugars and amino acids due to the intense heat at the bread surface. The crust of most breads is harder, and more complexly and intensely flavored, than the rest. Old wives&#x27; tales suggest that eating the bread crust makes a person&#x27;s hair curlier. Additionally, the crust is rumored to be healthier than the remainder of the bread. Some studies have shown that this is true as the crust has more dietary fiber and antioxidants such as pronyl-lysine.

==Preparation==

Doughs are usually baked, but in some cuisines breads are steamed (e.g., mantou), fried (e.g., puri), or baked on an unoiled frying pan (e.g., tortillas). It may be leavened or unleavened (e.g. matzo). Salt, fat and leavening agents such as yeast and baking soda are common ingredients, though bread may contain other ingredients, such as milk, egg, sugar, spice, fruit (such as raisins), vegetables (such as onion), nuts (such as walnut) or seeds (such as poppy).

Methods of processing dough into bread include the straight dough process, the sourdough process, the Chorleywood bread process and the sponge and dough process.

===Formulation===
Professional bread recipes are stated using the baker&#x27;s percentage notation. The amount of flour is denoted to be 100%, and the other ingredients are expressed as a percentage of that amount by weight. Measurement by weight is more accurate and consistent than measurement by volume, particularly for dry ingredients. The proportion of water to flour is the most important measurement in a bread recipe, as it affects texture and crumb the most. Hard wheat flours absorb about 62% water, while softer wheat flours absorb about 56%. Common table breads made from these doughs result in a finely textured, light bread. Most artisan bread formulas contain anywhere from 60 to 75% water. In yeast breads, the higher water percentages result in more CO2 bubbles and a coarser bread crumb.

Dough recipes commonly call for 500 grams (about 1.1 pounds) of flour, which yields a single loaf of bread or two baguettes.

Calcium propionate is commonly added by commercial bakeries to retard the growth of molds.

===Flour===
Flour is grain ground into a powder. Flour provides the primary structure, starch and protein to the final baked bread. The protein content of the flour is the best indicator of the quality of the bread dough and the finished bread. While bread can be made from all-purpose wheat flour, a specialty bread flour, containing more protein (12–14%), is recommended for high-quality bread. If one uses a flour with a lower protein content (9–11%) to produce bread, a shorter mixing time is required to develop gluten strength properly. An extended mixing time leads to oxidization of the dough, which gives the finished product a whiter crumb, instead of the cream color preferred by most artisan bakers.

Wheat flour, in addition to its starch, contains three water-soluble protein groups (albumin, globulin, and proteoses) and two water-insoluble protein groups (glutenin and gliadin). When flour is mixed with water, the water-soluble proteins dissolve, leaving the glutenin and gliadin to form the structure of the resulting bread. When relatively dry dough is worked by kneading, or wet dough is allowed to rise for a long time (see no-knead bread), the glutenin forms strands of long, thin, chainlike molecules, while the shorter gliadin forms bridges between the strands of glutenin. The resulting networks of strands produced by these two proteins are known as gluten. Gluten development improves if the dough is allowed to autolyse.

====Fortification====

Processing of flours usually involves removal of the outer layers, which contain important nutrients. Such flours, and bread made from them, may be fortified by adding nutrients. Fortification with added calcium, iron, thiamine (Vitamin B1) and niacin (Vitamin B3) is a legal requirement in the UK (wholemeal flours, from which the nutrients have not been stripped, are exempt). The unregulated term &quot;wheatmeal&quot; is used to describe flour containing some but not all of the outer covering and central part of the wheat grain.

===Liquids===

Water, or some other liquid, is used to form the flour into a paste or dough. The weight or ratio of liquid required varies between recipes, but a ratio of three parts liquid to five parts flour is common for yeast breads. Recipes that use steam as the primary leavening method may have a liquid content in excess of one part liquid to one part flour. Instead of water, recipes may use liquids such as milk or other dairy products (including buttermilk or yogurt), fruit juice, or eggs. These contribute additional sweeteners, fats, or leavening components, as well as water.

===Fats or shortenings===
Fats, such as butter, vegetable oils, lard, or that contained in eggs, affect the development of gluten in breads by coating and lubricating the individual strands of protein. They also help to hold the structure together. If too much fat is included in a bread dough, the lubrication effect causes the protein structures to divide. A fat content of approximately 3% by weight is the concentration that produces the greatest leavening action. In addition to their effects on leavening, fats also serve to tenderize breads and preserve freshness.

===Bread improvers===
Bread improvers and dough conditioners are often used in producing commercial breads to reduce the time needed for rising and to improve texture and volume and to give antistaling effects. The substances used may be oxidising agents to strengthen the dough or reducing agents to develop gluten and reduce mixing time, emulsifiers to strengthen the dough or to provide other properties such as making slicing easier, or enzymes to increase gas production.

===Salt===
Salt (sodium chloride) is very often added to enhance flavor and restrict yeast activity. It also affects the crumb and the overall texture by stabilizing and strengthening the gluten. Some artisan bakers forego early addition of salt to the dough, whether wholemeal or refined, and wait until after a 20-minute rest to allow the dough to autolyse.

Mixtures of salts are sometimes employed, such as employing potassium chloride to reduce the sodium level, and monosodium glutamate to give flavor (umami).

==Leavening==


Leavening is the process of adding gas to a dough before or during baking to produce a lighter, more easily chewed bread. Most bread eaten in the West is leavened.

===Chemicals===
A simple technique for leavening bread is the use of gas-producing chemicals. There are two common methods. The first is to use baking powder or a self-raising flour that includes baking powder. The second is to include an acidic ingredient such as buttermilk and add baking soda; the reaction of the acid with the soda produces gas. Chemically leavened breads are called &quot;quick breads&quot; and &quot;soda breads&quot;. This method is commonly used to make muffins, pancakes, American-style biscuits, and quick breads such as banana bread.

===Yeast===

Many breads are leavened by yeast. The yeast most commonly used for leavening bread is &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;, the same species used for brewing alcoholic beverages. This yeast ferments some of the sugars producing carbon dioxide. Commercial bakers often leaven their dough with commercially produced baker&#x27;s yeast. Baker&#x27;s yeast has the advantage of producing uniform, quick, and reliable results, because it is obtained from a pure culture. Many artisan bakers produce their own yeast with a growth culture. If kept in the right conditions, it provides leavening for many years.

The baker&#x27;s yeast and sourdough methods follow the same pattern. Water is mixed with flour, salt and the leavening agent. Other additions (spices, herbs, fats, seeds, fruit, etc.) are not needed to bake bread, but are often used. The mixed dough is then allowed to rise one or more times (a longer rising time results in more flavor, so bakers often &quot;punch down&quot; the dough and let it rise again), loaves are formed, and (after an optional final rising time) the bread is baked in an oven.

Many breads are made from a &quot;straight dough&quot;, which means that all of the ingredients are combined in one step, and the dough is baked after the rising time; others are made from a &quot;pre-ferment&quot; in which the leavening agent is combined with some of the flour and water a day or so ahead of baking and allowed to ferment overnight. On the day of baking, the rest of the ingredients are added, and the process continues as with straight dough. This produces a more flavorful bread with better texture. Many bakers see the starter method as a compromise between the reliable results of baker&#x27;s yeast and the flavor and complexity of a longer fermentation. It also allows the baker to use only a minimal amount of baker&#x27;s yeast, which was scarce and expensive when it first became available. Most yeasted pre-ferments fall into one of three categories: &quot;poolish&quot; or &quot;pouliche&quot;, a loose-textured mixture composed of roughly equal amounts of flour and water (by weight); &quot;biga&quot;, a stiff mixture with a higher proportion of flour; and &quot;pâte fermentée&quot;, which is a portion of dough reserved from a previous batch.

===Sourdough===

Sourdough is a type of bread produced by a long fermentation of dough using naturally occurring yeasts and lactobacilli. It usually has a mildly sour taste because of the lactic acid produced during anaerobic fermentation by the lactobacilli. Longer fermented sourdoughs can also contain acetic acid, the main non-water component of vinegar.

Sourdough breads are made with a sourdough starter. The starter cultivates yeast and lactobacilli in a mixture of flour and water, making use of the microorganisms already present on flour; it does not need any added yeast. A starter may be maintained indefinitely by regular additions of flour and water. Some bakers have starters many generations old, which are said to have a special taste or texture. At one time, all yeast-leavened breads were sourdoughs. Recently there has been a revival of sourdough bread in artisan bakeries.

Traditionally, peasant families throughout Europe baked on a fixed schedule, perhaps once a week. The starter was saved from the previous week&#x27;s dough. The starter was mixed with the new ingredients, the dough was left to rise, and then a piece of it was saved to be the starter for next week&#x27;s bread.

===Steam===
The rapid expansion of steam produced during baking leavens the bread, which is as simple as it is unpredictable. Steam-leavening is unpredictable since the steam is not produced until the bread is baked. Steam leavening happens regardless of the raising agents (baking soda, yeast, baking powder, sour dough, beaten egg white) included in the mix. The leavening agent either contains air bubbles or generates carbon dioxide. The heat vaporises the water from the inner surface of the bubbles within the dough. The steam expands and makes the bread rise. This is the main factor in the rising of bread once it has been put in the oven. CO2 generation, on its own, is too small to account for the rise. Heat kills bacteria or yeast at an early stage, so the CO2 generation is stopped.

===Bacteria===
Salt-rising bread does not use yeast. Instead, it is leavened by &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot;, one of the most common sources of food-borne illness.

===Aeration===
Aerated bread is leavened by carbon dioxide being forced into dough under pressure. From the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries, bread made this way was somewhat popular in the United Kingdom, made by the Aerated Bread Company and sold in its high-street tearooms. The company was founded in 1862, and ceased independent operations in 1955.

The Pressure-Vacuum mixer was later developed by the Flour Milling and Baking Research Association for the Chorleywood bread process. It manipulates the gas bubble size and optionally the composition of gases in the dough via the gas applied to the headspace.

== Cultural significance ==

Bread has a significance beyond mere nutrition in many cultures because of its history and contemporary importance. Bread is also significant in Christianity as one of the elements (alongside wine) of the Eucharist, and in other religions including Paganism.

In many cultures, bread is a metaphor for basic necessities and living conditions in general. For example, a &quot;bread-winner&quot; is a household&#x27;s main economic contributor and has little to do with actual bread-provision. This is also seen in the phrase &quot;putting bread on the table&quot;. The Roman poet Juvenal satirized superficial politicians and the public as caring only for &quot;panem et circenses&quot; (bread and circuses). In Russia in 1917, the Bolsheviks promised &quot;peace, land, and bread.&quot; The term &quot;breadbasket&quot; denotes an agriculturally productive region. In parts of Northern, Central, Southern and Eastern Europe bread and salt is offered as a welcome to guests. In India, life&#x27;s basic necessities are often referred to as &quot;roti, kapra aur makan&quot; (bread, clothes, and house).

Words for bread, including &quot;dough&quot; and &quot;bread&quot; itself, are used in English-speaking countries as synonyms for money. A remarkable or revolutionary innovation may be called the best thing since &quot;sliced bread&quot;. The expression &quot;to break bread with someone&quot; means &quot;to share a meal with someone&quot;. The English word &quot;lord&quot; comes from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;hlāfweard&quot;, meaning &quot;bread keeper.&quot;

Bread is sometimes referred to as &quot;the staff of life&quot;, although this term can refer to other staple foods in different cultures: the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines it as &quot;bread (or similar staple food)&quot;. This is sometimes thought to be a biblical reference, but the nearest wording is in Leviticus 26 &quot;when I have broken the staff of your bread&quot;. The term has been adopted in the names of bakery firms.

=== Fictional breads ===
Lembas bread: a fictional bread from &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. It was given to Frodo by Galadriel and kept him alive through his journey.

Bread of the two elders: a magical type of bread from &quot;Hungarian Folk Tales&quot; (from the Ördög és a kenyér story). It was able to talk and ward off the Ördög.

==Fraud==
Bread has been subject to food fraud and adulteration with fillers. In medieval times, sand was used as a filler.

The Russo-Ukrainian War has made sourcing wheat flour more challenging and raised concerns of bread flour fraud.
