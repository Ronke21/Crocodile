<text>Womxn and womyn are alternative political spellings of the English word &quot;woman&quot;, used by some feminists. There are other spellings, including womban (a reference to the womb or uterus) or womon (singular), and wombyn or wimmin (plural). Some writers who use such alternative spellings, avoiding the suffix or , see them as an expression of female independence and a repudiation of traditions that define women by reference to a male norm.

These re-spellings existed alongside the use of herstory, a feminist re-examination and re-telling of history.

== Definitions ==
The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) defines &quot;womyn&quot; as &quot;in feminist use: women.&quot;

The OED added &quot;womxn&quot; in 2021, and defines it as &quot;adopted by some as a more inclusive alternative to womyn, which is perceived as marginalizing certain groups, especially ethnic minority and transgender women.&quot;. Dictionary.com added &quot;womxn&quot; to its dictionary in 2019 with the definition &quot;used, especially in intersectional feminism, as an alternative spelling to avoid the suggestion of sexism perceived in the sequences m-a-n and m-e-n, and to be inclusive of trans and nonbinary people.&quot;

== Controversy ==

The terms &quot;womyn&quot; and &quot;womxn&quot; have been criticized for being unnecessary or confusing neologisms, due to the uncommonness of &quot;mxn&quot; to describe men.

The word &quot;womyn&quot; has been criticized by transgender people due to its usage in trans-exclusionary radical feminist circles which exclude trans women from identifying into the category of &quot;woman&quot;, particularly the term &quot;womyn-born womyn&quot;. The term &quot;wombyn&quot; was also particularly criticized by trans advocates since it implies that a woman must have a womb to be a woman.

Some trans-inclusionary feminists argue in favor of the word &quot;womxn&quot; as being more inclusive of transgender women, non-binary people, and intersex women, while other trans-inclusionary feminists criticize the term &quot;womxn&quot; for the implication that trans women are not &quot;women&quot; but are a separate category, or for the implication that non-binary people are women. Jennie Kermode, chair of Trans Media Watch, stated in 2018 that the organization would not use the term &quot;womxn&quot;, considering that &quot;women&quot; already includes trans women.

==Old English==

The word &quot;woman&quot; is derived from the Old English word (&#x27;woman-person&#x27;), which is formed from (the source of &quot;wife&quot;), then meaning &#x27;woman&#x27;, and (the source of &quot;man&quot;), then meaning &#x27;person, human&#x27;, originally without connotations of gender. &quot;Man&quot; took on its additional masculine meaning in the Late Middle English period, replacing the now-obsolete word . This has created the present situation with &quot;man&quot; bearing a dual meaning—either masculine or nonspecific.

Old English had a system of grammatical gender, whereby every noun was treated as either masculine, feminine or neuter, similar to modern German. In Old English sources, the word &quot;man&quot; was grammatically masculine but gender-neutral in meaning. One of its meanings was similar to the modern English usage of &quot;one&quot; as a gender-neutral indefinite pronoun (compare with &quot;mankind&quot; (&quot;man&quot; + &quot;kind&quot;), which means the human race, and German , which has retained the indefinite pronoun meaning to the modern day). The words &quot;wer&quot; and &quot;wīf&quot; were used, when necessary, to specify a man or woman, respectively. Combining them into &quot;werman&quot; or &quot;wīfman&quot; expressed the concept of &quot;any man&quot; or &quot;any woman&quot;. Some feminist writers have suggested that this more symmetrical usage reflected more egalitarian notions of gender at the time.

==18th and 19th century uses==
The term &quot;wimmin&quot; was considered by George P. Krapp (1872–1934), an American scholar of English, to be eye dialect, the literary technique of using nonstandard spelling that implies a pronunciation of the given word that is actually standard. The spelling indicates that the character&#x27;s speech overall is dialectal, foreign, or uneducated. This form of nonstandard spelling differs from others in that a difference in spelling does not indicate a difference in pronunciation of a word. That is, it is dialect to the eye rather than to the ear. It suggests that a character &quot;would use a vulgar pronunciation if there were one&quot; and &quot;is at the level of ignorance where one misspells in this fashion, hence mispronounces as well.&quot;

The word &quot;womyn&quot; appeared as an Older Scots spelling of &quot;woman&quot; in the Scots poetry of James Hogg. The word &quot;wimmin&quot; appeared in 19th-century renderings of Black American English, without any feminist significance.

== 20th century: second-wave feminism and &quot;womyn&quot; ==
Second-wave feminism developed several alternative political spellings of the word &quot;woman&quot;, especially womyn. Keridwen Luis, a sociologist at Brandeis University, states that feminists have experimented for decades to devise a suitable alternative for the term identifying the female gender. Such terms have included &quot;wimmin&quot; (in the 1990s), based upon the original Old English term, and &quot;womyn&quot; (since at least 1975).

The usage of &quot;womyn&quot; as a feminist spelling of &quot;women&quot; (with &quot;womon&quot; as the singular form) first appeared in print in 1976 referring to the first Michigan Womyn&#x27;s Music Festival. This is just after the founding of the Mountain Moving Coffeehouse for Womyn and Children, a lesbian feminist social event centred around women&#x27;s music. Both the annual &quot;MichFest&quot; and the weekly coffeehouse operated a womyn-born womyn (cisgender women-only) policy. Womyn&#x27;s land was another usage of the term, associated with separatist feminism.

Z. Budapest promoted the use of the word &quot;wimmin&quot; (singular &quot;womon&quot;) in the 1970s as part of her Dianic Wicca movement, which claims that present-day patriarchy represents a fall from a matriarchal golden age.

Millie Tant, a fictional character in the British satirical comic &quot;Viz&quot;, often used the term &quot;wimmin&quot; when discussing women&#x27;s rights.

== 2010s: fourth-wave feminism and &quot;womxn&quot; ==
In the mid 2010s, fourth-wave feminism focused on intersectionality and debated whether to use &quot;womxn&quot; as a term more inclusive of trans women, or whether to avoid &quot;womxn&quot; because it implied trans women are not women.
In 2017, the Womxn&#x27;s March on Seattle chose to use the term &quot;womxn&quot; to promote the march. Elizabeth Hunter-Keller, the event&#x27;s communications chair, told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that they chose it based upon the recommendation of a core organizer, who was a nonbinary person, and to reflect the organizing group&#x27;s diversity. Nita Harker, a sociologist and organizer of the march praised the term &quot;womxn&quot; for its ambiguity in pronunciation, saying that it forces users to &quot;stop and think&quot;. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, reporting on the march, called &quot;womxn&quot; term &quot;a powerful, increasingly popular label, encompassing a broader range of gender identities than &#x27;woman&#x27;—or even older feminist terms such as &#x27;womyn&#x27;... a nontraditional spelling for people whose gender identity doesn’t fit in the traditional boxes&quot;.

In January 2018, Portland held the Indigenous Womxn&#x27;s March, dedicated to missing and murdered indigenous girls, women, and transgender people.

In 2018, student university groups in the US and UK used &quot;womxn&quot; in communications, such as advertising for &quot;Womxn’s Basketball Session&quot; and &quot;Womxn of Color Network&quot;.

In 2018, the Wellcome Collection, a museum and library in London, made an announcement through Twitter using the term &quot;womxn&quot; to demonstrate their goal of including diverse perspectives; after complaints from hundreds of followers, the museum later apologized and removed the term from its website. Labour Party politician Jess Phillips responded to the incident by saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve never met a trans woman who was offended by the word woman being used, so I&#x27;m not sure why this keeps happening&quot;. Clara Bradbury-Rance of King&#x27;s College London conjectured that the push-back was because the use of the term was seen as too simplistic and a &quot;fix-all&quot;.

In a 2019 Styles article published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, journalist Breena Kerr stated that while &quot;womxn&quot; was difficult to pronounce, it was &quot;perhaps the most inclusive word yet&quot;.

On March 1, 2021, the streaming platform Twitch used the term &quot;womxn&quot; to promote events celebrating Women&#x27;s History Month. The event was announced through Twitter, which led to immediate backlash from various users who considered the term transphobic for implying that trans women are not &quot;women&quot; but a separate category (&quot;womxn&quot;). Twitch removed the tweet and apologised, stating that they wanted to use the word to acknowledge the shortcomings of gender-binary language and that they would use the term &quot;women&quot; moving forward.

<text>In grammar, a noun is a word that represents a concrete or abstract thing, such as living creatures, places, actions, qualities, states of existence, and ideas. A noun may serve as an object or subject within a phrase, clause, or sentence. 

In linguistics, nouns constitute a lexical category (part of speech) defined according to how its members combine with members of other lexical categories. The syntactic occurrence of nouns differs among languages. 

In English, prototypical nouns are common nouns or proper nouns that can occur with determiners, articles and attributive adjectives, and can function as the head of a noun phrase. According to traditional and popular classification, pronouns are distinct from nouns, but in much modern theory they are considered a subclass of nouns. Every language has various linguistic and grammatical distinctions between nouns and verbs.

== History ==

Word classes (parts of speech) were described by Sanskrit grammarians from at least the 5th century BC. In Yāska&#x27;s &quot;Nirukta&quot;, the noun (&quot;nāma&quot;) is one of the four main categories of words defined.

The Ancient Greek equivalent was &quot;ónoma&quot; (ὄνομα), referred to by Plato in the &quot;Cratylus&quot; dialog, and later listed as one of the eight parts of speech in &quot;The Art of Grammar&quot;, attributed to Dionysius Thrax (2nd century BC). The term used in Latin grammar was &quot;nōmen&quot;. All of these terms for &quot;noun&quot; were also words meaning &quot;name&quot;. The English word &quot;noun&quot; is derived from the Latin term, through the Anglo-Norman &quot;nom&quot; (other forms include &quot;nomme&quot;, and &quot;noun&quot; itself).

The word classes were defined partly by the grammatical forms that they take. In Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin, for example, nouns are categorized by gender and inflected for case and number. Because adjectives share these three grammatical categories, adjectives typically were placed in the same class as nouns.

Similarly, the Latin term &quot;nōmen&quot; includes both nouns (substantives) and adjectives, as originally did the English word &quot;noun&quot;, the two types being distinguished as &quot;nouns substantive&quot; and &quot;nouns adjective&quot; (or &quot;substantive nouns&quot; and &quot;adjective nouns&quot;, or simply &quot;substantives&quot; and &quot;adjectives&quot;). (The word &quot;nominal&quot; is now sometimes used to denote a class that includes both nouns and adjectives.)

Many European languages use a cognate of the word &quot;substantive&quot; as the basic term for &quot;noun&quot; (for example, Spanish &quot;sustantivo&quot;, &quot;noun&quot;). Nouns in the dictionaries of such languages are demarked by the abbreviation &quot;s.&quot; or &quot;sb.&quot; instead of &quot;n.&quot;, which may be used for proper nouns or neuter nouns instead. In English, some modern authors use the word &quot;substantive&quot; to refer to a class that includes both nouns (single words) and noun phrases (multiword units that are sometimes called &quot;noun equivalents&quot;). It can also be used as a counterpart to &quot;attributive&quot; when distinguishing between a noun being used as the head (main word) of a noun phrase and a noun being used as a noun adjunct. For example, the noun &quot;knee&quot; can be said to be used substantively in &quot;my knee hurts&quot;, but attributively in &quot;the patient needed knee replacement&quot;.

== Examples ==
* The &quot;cat&quot; sat on the &quot;chair&quot;.
* Please hand in your &quot;assignments&quot; by the &quot;end&quot; of the &quot;week&quot;.
* &quot;Cleanliness&quot; is next to &quot;godliness&quot;.
* &quot;Plato&quot; was an influential &quot;philosopher&quot; in ancient &quot;Greece&quot;.
* Revel the &quot;night&quot;, rob, murder, and commit / The oldest &quot;sins&quot; the newest &quot;kind&quot; of &quot;ways&quot;? Henry IV Part 2, act 4 scene 5.

A noun can co-occur with an article or an attributive adjective. Verbs and adjectives cannot. In the following, an asterisk (*) in front of an example means that this example is ungrammatical.

* &quot;the name&quot; (&quot;name&quot; is a noun: can co-occur with a definite article &quot;the&quot;)
* &quot;*the baptise&quot; (&quot;baptise&quot; is a verb: cannot co-occur with a definite article)
* &quot;constant circulation&quot; (&quot;circulation&quot; is a noun: can co-occur with the attributive adjective &quot;constant&quot;)
* &quot;*constant circulate&quot; (&quot;circulate&quot; is a verb: cannot co-occur with the attributive adjective &quot;constant&quot;)
* &quot;a fright&quot; (&quot;fright&quot; is a noun: can co-occur with the indefinite article &quot;a&quot;)
* &quot;*an afraid&quot; (&quot;afraid&quot; is an adjective: cannot co-occur with the article &quot;a&quot;)
* &quot;terrible fright&quot; (the noun &quot;fright&quot; can co-occur with the adjective &quot;terrible&quot;)
* &quot;*terrible afraid&quot; (the adjective &quot;afraid&quot; cannot co-occur with the adjective &quot;terrible&quot;)

== Characterization and definition ==

Nouns have sometimes been characterized in terms of the grammatical categories by which they may be varied (for example gender, case, and number). Such definitions tend to be language-specific, since different languages may apply different categories.

Nouns are frequently defined, particularly in informal contexts, in terms of their semantic properties (their meanings). Nouns are described as words that refer to a &quot;person&quot;, &quot;place&quot;, &quot;thing&quot;, &quot;event&quot;, &quot;substance&quot;, &quot;quality&quot;, &quot;quantity&quot;, etc., but this manner of definition has been criticized as uninformative.

Several English nouns lack an intrinsic referent of their own: &quot;behalf&quot; (as in &quot;on behalf of&quot;), &quot;dint&quot; (&quot;by dint of&quot;), and &quot;sake&quot; (&quot;for the sake of&quot;). Moreover, other parts of speech may have reference-like properties: the verbs &quot;to rain&quot; or &quot;to mother&quot;, or adjectives like &quot;red&quot;; and there is little difference between the adverb &quot;gleefully&quot; and the prepositional phrase &quot;with glee&quot;.

A functional approach defines a noun as a word that can be the head of a nominal phrase, i.e., a phrase with referential function, without needing to go through morphological transformation.

== Classification ==
Nouns can have a number of different properties and are often sub-categorized based on various of these criteria, depending on their occurrence in a language. Nouns may be classified according to morphological properties such as which prefixes or suffixes they take, and also their relations in syntax – how they combine with other words and expressions of various types. 

Many such classifications are language-specific, given the obvious differences in syntax and morphology. In English for example, it might be noted that nouns are words that can co-occur with definite articles (as stated at the start of this article), but this could not apply in Russian, which has no definite articles.

=== Gender ===
In some languages common and proper nouns have grammatical gender, typically masculine, feminine, and neuter. The gender of a noun (as well as its number and case, where applicable) will often require agreement in words that modify or are used along with it. In French for example, the singular form of the definite article is &quot;le&quot; for masculine nouns and &quot;la&quot; for feminine; adjectives and certain verb forms also change (sometimes with the simple addition of for feminine). Grammatical gender often correlates with the form of the noun and the inflection pattern it follows; for example, in both Italian and Romanian most nouns ending in &quot;-a&quot; are feminine. Gender can also correlate with the sex or social gender of the noun&#x27;s referent, particularly in the case of nouns denoting people (and sometimes animals), though with exceptions (the feminine French noun &quot;personne&quot; can refer to a male or a female person).

In Modern English, even common nouns like &quot;hen&quot; and &quot;princess&quot; and proper nouns like &quot;Alicia&quot; do not have grammatical gender (their femininity has no relevance in syntax), though they denote persons or animals of a specific sex. The gender of a pronoun must be appropriate for the item referred to: &quot;The &quot;girl&quot; said the &quot;ring&quot; was from &quot;her&quot; new &quot;boyfriend&quot;, but &quot;he&quot; denied &quot;it&quot; was from &quot;him&quot;&quot; (three nouns; and three gendered pronouns: or four, if this &quot;her&quot; is counted as a possessive pronoun).

=== Proper and common nouns ===

A &quot;proper noun&quot; (sometimes called a &quot;proper name&quot;, though the two terms normally have different meanings) is a noun that represents a unique entity (&quot;India&quot;, &quot;Pegasus&quot;, &quot;Jupiter&quot;, &quot;Confucius&quot;, &quot;Pequod&quot;) – as distinguished from &quot;common nouns&quot; (or appellative nouns), which describe a class of entities (&quot;country&quot;, &quot;animal&quot;, &quot;planet&quot;, &quot;person&quot;, &quot;ship&quot;). In Modern English, most proper nouns – unlike most common nouns – are capitalized regardless of context (&quot;Albania&quot;, &quot;Newton&quot;, &quot;Pasteur&quot;, &quot;America&quot;), as are many of the forms that are derived from them (the common noun in &quot;he&#x27;s an &quot;Albanian&quot;&quot;; the adjectival forms in &quot;he&#x27;s of &quot;Albanian&quot; heritage&quot; and &quot;&quot;Newtonian&quot; physics&quot;, but not in &quot;&quot;pasteurized&quot; milk&quot;; the second verb in &quot;they sought to &quot;Americanize&quot; us&quot;).

=== Countable nouns and mass nouns ===
&quot;Count nouns&quot; or &quot;countable nouns&quot; are common nouns that can take a plural, can combine with numerals or counting quantifiers (e.g., &quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;several&quot;, &quot;every&quot;, &quot;most&quot;), and can take an indefinite article such as &quot;a&quot; or &quot;an&quot; (in languages that have such articles). Examples of count nouns are &quot;chair&quot;, &quot;nose&quot;, and &quot;occasion&quot;.

&quot;Mass nouns&quot; or &quot;uncountable&quot; (&quot;non-count&quot;) &quot;nouns&quot; differ from count nouns in precisely that respect: they cannot take plurals or combine with number words or the above type of quantifiers. For example, the forms &quot;a furniture&quot; and &quot;three furnitures&quot; are not used – even though &quot;pieces&quot; of furniture can be counted. The distinction between mass and count nouns does not primarily concern their corresponding referents but more how the nouns &quot;present&quot; those entities.

Many nouns have both countable and uncountable uses; for example, &quot;soda&quot; is countable in &quot;give me three sodas&quot;, but uncountable in &quot;he likes soda&quot;.

=== Collective nouns ===
&quot;Collective nouns&quot; are nouns that – even when they are treated in their morphology and syntax as singular – refer to &quot;groups&quot; consisting of more than one individual or entity. Examples include &quot;committee&quot;, &quot;government&quot;, and &quot;police&quot;. In English these nouns may be followed by a singular or a plural verb and referred to by a singular or plural pronoun, the singular being generally preferred when referring to the body as a unit and the plural often being preferred, especially in British English, when emphasizing the individual members. Examples of acceptable and unacceptable use given by Gowers in &quot;Plain Words&quot; include:


=== Concrete nouns and abstract nouns ===
&quot;Concrete nouns&quot; refer to physical entities that can, in principle at least, be observed by at least one of the senses (&quot;chair&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;Janet&quot;, &quot;atom&quot;), as items supposed to exist in the physical world. &quot;Abstract nouns&quot;, on the other hand, refer to abstract objects: ideas or concepts (&quot;justice&quot;, &quot;anger&quot;, &quot;solubility&quot;, &quot;duration&quot;).

Some nouns have both concrete and abstract meanings: &quot;art&quot; usually refers to something abstract (&quot;Art is important in human culture&quot;), but it can also refer to a concrete item (&quot;I put my daughter&#x27;s art up on the fridge&quot;). A noun might have a literal (concrete) and also a figurative (abstract) meaning: &quot;a brass &quot;key&quot;&quot; and &quot;the &quot;key&quot; to success&quot;; &quot;a &quot;block&quot; in the pipe&quot; and &quot;a mental &quot;block&quot;&quot;. Similarly, some abstract nouns have developed etymologically by figurative extension from literal roots (&quot;drawback&quot;, &quot;fraction&quot;, &quot;holdout&quot;, &quot;uptake&quot;).

Many abstract nouns in English are formed by adding a suffix (&quot;-ness&quot;, &quot;-ity&quot;, &quot;-ion&quot;) to adjectives or verbs (&quot;happiness&quot; and &quot;serenity&quot; from the adjectives &quot;happy&quot; and &quot;serene&quot;; &quot;circulation&quot; from the verb &quot;circulate&quot;).

=== Alienable vs. inalienable nouns ===

Illustrating the wide range of possible classifying principles for nouns, the Awa language of Papua New Guinea regiments nouns according to how &quot;ownership&quot; is assigned: as alienable possession or inalienable possession. An alienably possessed item (a tree, for example) can exist even without a possessor. But inalienably possessed items are necessarily associated with their possessor and are referred to differently, for example with nouns that function as kin terms (meaning &quot;father&quot;, etc.), body-part nouns (meaning &quot;shadow&quot;, &quot;hair&quot;, etc.), or part–whole nouns (meaning &quot;top&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot;, etc.).

== Noun phrases ==
A noun phrase (or NP) is a phrase usually headed by a common noun, a proper noun, or a pronoun. The head may be the only constituent, or it may be modified by determiners and adjectives. For example, &quot;The dog sat near Ms Curtis and wagged its tail&quot; contains three NPs: &quot;the dog&quot; (subject of the verbs &quot;sat&quot; and &quot;wagged&quot;); &quot;Ms Curtis&quot; (complement of the preposition &quot;near&quot;); and &quot;its tail&quot; (object of &quot;wagged&quot;). &quot;You became their teacher&quot; contains two NPs: &quot;you&quot; (subject of &quot;became&quot;); and &quot;their teacher&quot;.

==Nouns in relation to other word classes==
===Pronouns===
Nouns and noun phrases can typically be replaced by pronouns, such as &quot;he, it, she, they, which, these&quot;, and &quot;those&quot;, to avoid repetition or explicit identification, or for other reasons (but as noted earlier, current theory often classifies pronouns as a subclass of nouns parallel to &quot;prototypical nouns&quot;). For example, in the sentence &quot;Gareth thought she was weird&quot;, the word &quot;she&quot; is a pronoun that refers to a person just as the noun &quot;Gareth&quot; does. The word &quot;one&quot; can replace parts of noun phrases, and it sometimes stands in for a noun. An example is given below:

But &quot;one&quot; can also stand in for larger parts of a noun phrase. For example, in the following example, &quot;one&quot; can stand in for &quot;new car&quot;.

===Nominalization===

Nominalization is a process whereby a word that belongs to another part of speech comes to be used as a noun. This can be a way to create new nouns, or to use other words in ways that resemble nouns. In French and Spanish, for example, adjectives frequently act as nouns referring to people who have the characteristics denoted by the adjective. This sometimes happens in English as well, as in the following examples:

<text>The fisherman&#x27;s knot is a bend (a knot for joining two lines) with a symmetrical structure. The fisherman&#x27;s knot is also known as: angler&#x27;s knot, English knot, halibut knot, waterman&#x27;s knot, and true lovers&#x27; knot.

== Properties ==
The bend consists of two overhand knots, each tied around the standing part of the other. It is compact, jams when tightened, and the working ends can be cropped very close to the knot. It can easily be tied with cold, wet hands.
== Uses ==
These properties are well suited to fishing, so the fisherman&#x27;s knot is often used with fishing line. However it can slip when using modern nylon monofilament line, which is more slippery than historic fishing materials. If more holding strength is required, the overhand knots can be made with more turns, as in the double fisherman&#x27;s knot, and triple fisherman&#x27;s knot. Other knots sometimes provide superior performance with nylon lines, such as the blood knot.

In knitting, this knot is used to join two strands of yarn. In this context, it is commonly known as &quot;the magic knot&quot;.

<text>Rutger Oelsen Hauer (born ; 23 January 1944 – 19 July 2019) was a Dutch actor, with a film career that spanned over 170 roles across nearly 50 years, beginning in 1969. In 1999, he was named by the Dutch public as the Best Dutch Actor of the Century.

Hauer&#x27;s career began in 1969 with the title role in the Dutch television series &quot;Floris&quot; and surged with his leading role in &quot;Turkish Delight&quot; (1973), which in 1999 was named the Best Dutch Film of the Century. After gaining international recognition with &quot;Soldier of Orange&quot; (1977) and &quot;Spetters&quot; (1980), he moved into American films such as &quot;Nighthawks&quot; (1981) and &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982), starring in the latter as self-aware replicant Roy Batty. His performance in &quot;Blade Runner&quot; led to roles in &quot;The Osterman Weekend&quot; (1983), &quot;Ladyhawke&quot; (1985), &quot;The Hitcher&quot; (1986), &quot;The Legend of the Holy Drinker&quot; (1988), and &quot;Blind Fury&quot; (1989), among other films.

From the 1990s on, Hauer moved into low-budget films, and supporting roles in major films like &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1992), &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot; (2002), &quot;Batman Begins&quot; (2005), &quot;Sin City&quot; (2005), and &quot;The Rite&quot; (2011). Hauer also became well known for his work in commercials. Towards the end of his career, he made a return to Dutch cinema, and won the 2012 Rembrandt Award for Best Actor in recognition of his lead role in &quot;The Heineken Kidnapping&quot; (2011). 

Hauer supported environmentalist causes and was a member of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. He also founded the Rutger Hauer Starfish Association, an AIDS awareness organization. He was made a knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion in 2013.

== Early life ==
Hauer was born in Breukelen, in the Province of Utrecht, on 23 January 1944, while the Netherlands was under German occupation during World War II. He stated in a 1981 interview, &quot;I was born in the middle of the war, and I think for that reason I have deep roots in pacifism. Violence frightens me.&quot; His parents were Teunke (née Mellema) and Arend Hauer, both actors who operated an acting school in nearby Amsterdam. He had three sisters. According to Hauer, his parents were more interested in their art than their children. He did not have a close relationship with his father, and writer Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema later became a father figure to Hauer after they met during the filming of &quot;Soldier of Orange&quot;.

Hauer attended a Rudolf Steiner school, as his parents wanted him to develop his creativity. At the age of 15, he left school to join the Dutch merchant navy. He spent a year travelling the world aboard a freighter, but was unable to become a captain due to his colourblindness. Returning home, he worked odd jobs while finishing his high school diploma at night. He then entered the Academy for Theater and Dance in Amsterdam for acting classes, but soon dropped out to join the Royal Netherlands Army. He received training as a combat medic, but left the service after a few months as he opposed the use of deadly weapons. He subsequently returned to acting school and graduated in 1967.

== Career ==
=== Early works ===
Hauer had his first acting role at the age of 11, as Eurysakes in the play &quot;Ajax&quot;. After graduating from the Academy for Theater and Dance, he became a stage actor with the . Hauer made his screen debut in 1969 when Paul Verhoeven cast him in the lead role of the television series &quot;Floris&quot;, a Dutch medieval action drama. The role made him famous in his native country, and Hauer reprised his role for the 1975 German remake &quot;Floris von Rosemund&quot;.

Hauer&#x27;s career changed course when Verhoeven cast him in &quot;Turkish Delight&quot; (1973), which received an Oscar nomination for best foreign-language film. The film found box office favour abroad and at home, and Hauer looked to appear in more international films. Within two years, Hauer made his English-language debut in the British film &quot;The Wilby Conspiracy&quot; (1975). Set in South Africa, the film was an action-drama with a focus on apartheid. Hauer&#x27;s supporting role, however, was barely noticed in Hollywood, and he returned to Dutch films for several years. During this period, he made &quot;Katie Tippel&quot; (1975) and worked again with Verhoeven on &quot;Soldier of Orange&quot; (1977), and &quot;Spetters&quot; (1980). These two films paired Hauer with fellow Dutch actor Jeroen Krabbé. At the 1981 Netherlands Film Festival, Hauer received the Golden Calf for Best Actor for his overall body of work.

=== American breakthrough ===
Hauer made his American debut in the Sylvester Stallone film &quot;Nighthawks&quot; (1981) as a psychopathic and cold-blooded terrorist named Wulfgar. With his sights set on a long-term career in Hollywood, Hauer worked with an accent coach in the early 1980s to develop a convincing American accent. Unafraid of controversial roles, he portrayed the German architect and Nazi minister Albert Speer in the 1982 American Broadcasting Company production &quot;Inside the Third Reich&quot;. The same year, Hauer appeared in arguably his most famous and acclaimed role as the eccentric and violent but sympathetic antihero Roy Batty in Ridley Scott&#x27;s 1982 science fiction thriller &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, in which he delivered the famous tears in rain monologue. Hauer composed parts of the monologue the evening prior to filming, &quot;cutting away swathes of the original script before adding the speech&#x27;s poignant final line&quot;. He went on to play the adventurer courting Theresa Russell in &quot;Eureka&quot; (1983), an investigative reporter opposite John Hurt in &quot;The Osterman Weekend&quot; (1983), the hardened mercenary Martin in &quot;Flesh &amp; Blood&quot; (1985), and a knight paired with Michelle Pfeiffer in &quot;Ladyhawke&quot; (1985).

He appeared in &quot;The Hitcher&quot; (1986) as the titular mysterious hitchhiker tormenting a lone motorist, murdering anyone in his way. He received the 1987 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in the television film &quot;Escape from Sobibor&quot;. At the height of Hauer&#x27;s fame, he was set to be cast as RoboCop (1987), but Verhoeven, the film&#x27;s director, considered his frame as too large to move comfortably in the character&#x27;s suit. Also in 1987, Hauer starred as Nick Randall in &quot;&quot; as the descendant of the character played by Steve McQueen in the television series of the same name.

In 1988, he played a homeless man in Ermanno Olmi&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of the Holy Drinker&quot;. This performance won Hauer the Best Actor award at the 1989 Seattle International Film Festival. Hauer was chosen to portray a blind martial artist superhero in Phillip Noyce&#x27;s action film &quot;Blind Fury&quot; (1989). He initially struggled with the implausibility of the character, but learned to &quot;unfocus my eyes, to react to smells and sounds&quot; after meeting with blind judo practitioner Lynn Manning during his research for the role. Hauer returned to science fiction in 1989 with &quot;The Blood of Heroes&quot;, in which he played a gladiator in a post-apocalyptic world.

=== Commercials and later roles ===

By the 1990s, Hauer was well known for his humorous Guinness commercials as well as his screen roles, which had increasingly involved low-budget films, such as &quot;Split Second&quot; (1992); &quot;The Beans of Egypt, Maine&quot; (1994); &quot;Omega Doom&quot; (1996) and &quot;New World Disorder&quot; (1999). In 1992, he appeared in the horror-comedy film &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; as the main antagonist vampire Lothos. He also appeared in the Kylie Minogue music video &quot;On a Night Like This&quot; (2000). During this time, Hauer acted in several British, Canadian and American television productions, including &quot;Amelia Earhart: The Final Flight&quot; (1994) as Earhart&#x27;s navigator Fred Noonan, &quot;Fatherland&quot; (1994), &quot;Hostile Waters&quot; (1997), &quot;The Call of the Wild: Dog of the Yukon&quot; (1997), &quot;Merlin&quot; (1998), &quot;The 10th Kingdom&quot; (2000), &quot;Smallville&quot; (2003), &quot;Alias&quot; (2003), and &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot; (2004).

Hauer played an assassin in &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot; (2003), a villainous cardinal with influential power in &quot;Sin City&quot; (2005) and a devious corporate executive running Wayne Enterprises in &quot;Batman Begins&quot; (2005). Also in 2005, he played the title role in Patrick Lussier&#x27;s film &quot;Dracula III: Legacy&quot;. Seven years later, he portrayed the vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing in Dario Argento&#x27;s &quot;Dracula 3D&quot;. Hauer hosted the British reality television documentary &quot;Shock Treatment&quot; in 2005, and featured in &quot;Goal II: Living the Dream&quot; (2007) as Real Madrid coach Rudi Van der Merwe. He also recorded voice-overs for the British advertising campaign for the Danish butter brand Lurpak. 

In 2008, Hauer received the Golden Calf Culture Prize for his contributions to Dutch cinema. The award recognised his work as an actor as well as his efforts to aid the development of young filmmakers and actors, through initiatives such as the . In 2009, his role in avant-garde filmmaker Cyrus Frisch&#x27;s &quot;Dazzle&quot; received positive reviews; it was described in Dutch press as &quot;the most relevant Dutch film of the year&quot;. The same year, Hauer starred in the title role of &quot;Barbarossa&quot;, an Italian film directed by Renzo Martinelli. In April 2010, he was cast in the live action adaptation of the short and fictitious &quot;Grindhouse&quot; trailer &quot;Hobo with a Shotgun&quot; (2011). Hauer played Freddie Heineken in &quot;The Heineken Kidnapping&quot; (2011), for which he received the 2012 Rembrandt Award for Best Actor. Also in 2011, Hauer appeared in the supernatural horror film &quot;The Rite&quot; as an undertaker named Istvan, the protagonist&#x27;s father.

From 2013 to 2014, Hauer featured as Niall Brigant in HBO&#x27;s &quot;True Blood&quot;. In 2015, he starred as Ravn in &quot;The Last Kingdom&quot; and as Kingsley in &quot;Galavant&quot;. In 2016, he joined the film jury for ShortCutz Amsterdam, an annual film festival promoting short films in Amsterdam. Hauer voiced the role of Daniel Lazarski in the 2017 video game &quot;Observer&quot;, set in post-apocalyptic Poland. Lazarski is a member of a special elite police unit that can hack into minds and interact with memories within. Hauer also provided the voice of Xehanort in the 2019 video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;, replacing the late Leonard Nimoy; following his death, he was replaced by Christopher Lloyd.

== Personal life ==
Hauer was married twice. Hauer and his first wife, Heidi Merz, produced Hauer&#x27;s only child, Ayesha Hauer (born 1966). An actress, she gave birth to Hauer&#x27;s grandson in 1987. Hauer was with his second wife, Ineke ten Cate, from 1968, and they married in a private ceremony on 22 November 1985. Ten Cate was the daughter of Laurens ten Cate, the editor-in-chief of the Friesland-based newspaper &quot;Leeuwarder Courant&quot;. Although born in Utrecht, Hauer had strong links to Friesland. He once stated in an interview with the &quot;Algemeen Dagblad&quot; that he &quot;needed to feel the Frisian clay under [his] feet&quot;. Hauer was an environmentalist. He supported the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society and was a member of its board of advisors. He also established an AIDS awareness organization called the Rutger Hauer Starfish Association. In April 2007, he published his autobiography, &quot;All Those Moments: Stories of Heroes, Villains, Replicants, and Blade Runners&quot; (co-written with Patrick Quinlan), in which he discussed many of his acting roles. Proceeds from the book go to the Rutger Hauer Starfish Association. Hauer died from pancreatic cancer on 19 July 2019 at his residence in the Netherlands, age 75.

<text>A terrarium ( terraria or terrariums) is a glass container containing soil and plants in an environment different from the surroundings. It is usually a sealable container that can be opened for maintenance or to access the plants inside; however, terraria can also be open to the atmosphere. Terraria are often kept as ornamental items. 

A closed terrarium&#x27;s transparent walls allow heat and light to enter, creating a very favorable environment for plant growth. Heat entering the sealed container allows the creation of a small water cycle due to evaporating moisture from the soil and plants. The water vapor then condenses onto the walls of the container, eventually falling back onto the plants and soil below. Light passing through the transparent walls allows photosynthesis. Open terraria are not sealed and are better suited to plants requiring a more arid environment.

==History==
The first terrarium was developed by botanist Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward in 1842. Ward had an interest in observing insect behaviour and accidentally left one of his jars unattended. A fern spore in the jar grew and germinated into a plant, becoming the first known terrarium. The trend quickly spread in the Victorian Era amongst the English. Instead of the terrarium, it was known as the Wardian case.

Ward hired carpenters to build his Wardian cases to export native British plants to Sydney, Australia. After months of travel, the plants arrived well and thriving. Likewise, plants from Australia sent to London using the same method were received by Ward in pristine condition. His experiment indicated plants can be sealed, without ventilation, and continue thriving. Wardian cases were used for many decades by Kew Gardens to ship plants around the British Empire and were also used during European colonization of Africa to bring African goods, like spices and coffee, back to Europe.

==Types==
Terraria are typically classified into two categories: closed and open. Closed terraria are sealed shut with a lid, door, or cork; open terraria have access to fresh air, most commonly by leaving the container open or through a hole drilled into the container.

===Closed terrarium===
thumb|Diagram of sealed terrarium

Tropical plant varieties, such as moss, orchids, ferns, and air plants are generally kept within closed terraria to replicate their native humid, sheltered environment in the tropics. Keeping the terrarium sealed allows for circulation of water, making the terrarium self-sufficient. The terrarium may be opened once a week, allowing evaporation of excess moisture from the air and walls of the container, to prevent growth of mold or algae, which may damage plants and discolor the sides of the terrarium. Springtails may be used to consume mold or fungi within the terrarium.

Any wilting plants or absence of condensation on the walls of the terrarium indicates the terrarium requires water; watering is primarily done using a spray bottle.

Closed terrarium benefit from specific soil mixes to ensure ideal growing conditions and reduce risk of microbial damage; a common medium used is &quot;peat-lite:&quot; a mixture of peat moss, vermiculite, and perlite. The mixture should be sterile to minimize risk of introducing potentially harmful microbes to the terrarium.

===Open terrarium===
Not all plants require or are suited to the moist environment of closed terraria; open terraria are better suited for plants preferring less humidity and soil moisture, such as temperate plants and plants adapted to dry climates. Open terraria also work well for plants requiring more (but not direct) sunlight, as closed terraria can trap excess heat, potentially killing the plants inside. While open terraria require more watering than closed terraria, they have reduced risk of disease due to their lower humidity.

==== Difference from dish garden ====
An open terrarium should not be confused with a dish garden. A terrarium, even open, allows for increased humidity compared to the environment outside the structure, whereas a dish garden does not provide additional humidity. Due to the transparent walls of terraria causing magnification of the sun&#x27;s rays, terraria cannot be placed in direct sunlight because the intense light will cause foliage to burn. A dish garden can tolerate direct sun, as long as it is planted with full sun-tolerant plants. Succulents and cacti are better suited for a dish garden than a terrarium because dish gardens allow succulents and cacti to be placed in the full sun they require without burning.

<text>Garnets () are a group of silicate minerals that have been used since the Bronze Age as gemstones and abrasives.

All species of garnet possess similar physical properties and crystal forms but differ in chemical composition. The different species are pyrope, almandine, spessartine, grossular (varieties of which are hessonite or cinnamon-stone and tsavorite), uvarovite and andradite. The garnets make up two solid solution series: pyrope-almandine-spessartine (pyralspite), with the composition range ; and uvarovite-grossular-andradite (ugrandite), with the composition range .

==Etymology==
The word &quot;garnet&quot; comes from the 14th-century Middle English word &quot;gernet&quot;, meaning &#x27;dark red&#x27;. It is borrowed from Old French &quot;grenate&quot; from Latin &quot;granatus,&quot; from &quot;granum&quot; (&#x27;grain, seed&#x27;). This is possibly a reference to &quot;mela granatum&quot; or even &quot;pomum granatum&quot; (&#x27;pomegranate&#x27;, &quot;Punica granatum&quot;), a plant whose fruits contain abundant and vivid red seed covers (arils), which are similar in shape, size, and color to some garnet crystals. Hessonite garnet is also named &#x27;gomed&#x27; in Indian literature and is one of the nine jewels in Vedic astrology that comprise the Navaratna.

==Physical properties==
===Properties===
Garnet species are found in every colour, with reddish shades most common. Blue garnets are the rarest and were first reported in the 1990s.

Garnet species&#x27; light transmission properties can range from the gemstone-quality transparent specimens to the opaque varieties used for industrial purposes as abrasives. The mineral&#x27;s lustre is categorized as vitreous (glass-like) or resinous (amber-like).

===Crystal structure===
Garnets are nesosilicates having the general formula &quot;X&quot;3&quot;Y&quot;2()3. The &quot;X&quot; site is usually occupied by divalent cations (Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn)2+ and the &quot;Y&quot; site by trivalent cations (Al3+, Fe3+, Cr3+) in an octahedral/tetrahedral framework with [SiO4]4− occupying the tetrahedra. Garnets are most often found in the dodecahedral crystal habit, but are also commonly found in the trapezohedron habit as well as the hexoctahedral habit. They crystallize in the cubic system, having three axes that are all of equal length and perpendicular to one another but are never actually cubic because, despite being isometric, the {100} and {111} families of planes are depleted. Garnets do not have any cleavage planes, so, when they fracture under stress, sharp, irregular (conchoidal) pieces are formed.

===Hardness===
Because the chemical composition of garnet varies, the atomic bonds in some species are stronger than in others. As a result, this mineral group shows a range of hardness on the Mohs scale of about 6.0 to 7.5. The harder species like almandine are often used for abrasive purposes.

===Magnetics used in garnet series identification===
For gem identification purposes, a pick-up response to a strong neodymium magnet separates garnet from all other natural transparent gemstones commonly used in the jewelry trade. Magnetic susceptibility measurements in conjunction with refractive index can be used to distinguish garnet species and varieties, and determine the composition of garnets in terms of percentages of end-member species within an individual gem.

==Garnet group end member species==

===Pyralspite garnets – aluminium in &quot;Y&quot; site===
*Almandine: Fe3Al2(SiO4)3
*Pyrope: Mg3Al2(SiO4)3
*Spessartine: Mn3Al2(SiO4)3

====Almandine====
Almandine, sometimes incorrectly called almandite, is the modern gem known as carbuncle (though originally almost any red gemstone was known by this name). The term &quot;carbuncle&quot; is derived from the Latin meaning &quot;live coal&quot; or burning charcoal. The name &quot;Almandine&quot; is a corruption of Alabanda, a region in Asia Minor where these stones were cut in ancient times. Chemically, almandine is an iron-aluminium garnet with the formula Fe3Al2(SiO4)3; the deep red transparent stones are often called precious garnet and are used as gemstones (being the most common of the gem garnets). Almandine occurs in metamorphic rocks like mica schists, associated with minerals such as staurolite, kyanite, andalusite, and others. Almandine has nicknames of Oriental garnet, almandine ruby, and carbuncle.

====Pyrope====
Pyrope (from the Greek &quot;pyrōpós&quot; meaning &quot;firelike&quot;) is red in color and chemically an aluminium silicate with the formula Mg3Al2(SiO4)3, though the magnesium can be replaced in part by calcium and ferrous iron. The color of pyrope varies from deep red to black. Pyrope and spessartine gemstones have been recovered from the Sloan diamondiferous kimberlites in Colorado, from the Bishop Conglomerate and in a Tertiary age lamprophyre at Cedar Mountain in Wyoming.

A variety of pyrope from Macon County, North Carolina is a violet-red shade and has been called &quot;rhodolite&quot;, Greek for &quot;rose&quot;. In chemical composition it may be considered as essentially an isomorphous mixture of pyrope and almandine, in the proportion of two parts pyrope to one part almandine. Pyrope has tradenames some of which are misnomers; &quot;Cape ruby&quot;, &quot;Arizona ruby&quot;, &quot;California ruby&quot;, &quot;Rocky Mountain ruby&quot;, and &quot;Bohemian ruby&quot; from the Czech Republic.

Pyrope is an indicator mineral for high-pressure rocks. Mantle-derived rocks (peridotites and eclogites) commonly contain a pyrope variety.

====Spessartine====
Spessartine or spessartite is manganese aluminium garnet, Mn3Al2(SiO4)3. Its name is derived from Spessart in Bavaria. It occurs most often in skarns, granite pegmatite and allied rock types, and in certain low grade metamorphic phyllites. Spessartine of an orange-yellow is found in Madagascar. Violet-red spessartines are found in rhyolites in Colorado 

====Pyrope–spessartine (blue garnet or color-change garnet)====
Blue pyrope–spessartine garnets were discovered in the late 1990s in Bekily, Madagascar. This type has also been found in parts of the United States, Russia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Turkey. It changes color from blue-green to purple depending on the color temperature of viewing light, as a result of the relatively high amounts of vanadium (about 1 wt.% V2O3).

Other varieties of color-changing garnets exist. In daylight, their color ranges from shades of green, beige, brown, gray, and blue, but in incandescent light, they appear a reddish or purplish/pink color.

This is the rarest type of garnet. Because of its color-changing quality, this kind of garnet resembles alexandrite.

===Ugrandite group – calcium in &quot;X&quot; site===
*Andradite: Ca3Fe2(SiO4)3
*Grossular: Ca3Al2(SiO4)3
*Uvarovite: Ca3Cr2(SiO4)3

====Andradite====
Andradite is a calcium-iron garnet, Ca3Fe2(SiO4)3, is of variable composition and may be red, yellow, brown, green or black. The recognized varieties are demantoid (green), melanite (black), and topazolite (yellow or green). The red-brown translucent variety of colophonite is recognized as a partially obsolete name. Andradite is found in skarns and in deep-seated igneous rocks like syenite as well as serpentines and greenschists. Demantoid is one of the most prized of garnet varieties.

====Grossular====

Grossular is a calcium-aluminium garnet with the formula Ca3Al2(SiO4)3, though the calcium may in part be replaced by ferrous iron and the aluminium by ferric iron. The name grossular is derived from the botanical name for the gooseberry, &quot;grossularia&quot;, in reference to the green garnet of this composition that is found in Siberia. Other shades include cinnamon brown (cinnamon stone variety), red, and yellow. Because of its inferior hardness to zircon, which the yellow crystals resemble, they have also been called &quot;hessonite&quot; from the Greek meaning inferior. Grossular is found in skarns, contact metamorphosed limestones with vesuvianite, diopside, wollastonite and wernerite.

Grossular garnet from Kenya and Tanzania has been called tsavorite. Tsavorite was first described in the 1960s in the Tsavo area of Kenya, from which the gem takes its name.

====Uvarovite====
Uvarovite is a calcium chromium garnet with the formula Ca3Cr2(SiO4)3. This is a rather rare garnet, bright green in color, usually found as small crystals associated with chromite in peridotite, serpentinite, and kimberlites. It is found in crystalline marbles and schists in the Ural Mountains of Russia and Outokumpu, Finland. Uvarovite is named for Count Uvaro, a Russian imperial statesman.

===Less common species===
*Calcium in &quot;X&quot; site
**Goldmanite: 
**Kimzeyite: 
**Morimotoite: 
**Schorlomite: 
*Hydroxide bearing – calcium in &quot;X&quot; site
**Hydrogrossular: 
***Hibschite: (where x is between 0.2 and 1.5)
***Katoite: (where x is greater than 1.5)
*Magnesium or manganese in &quot;X&quot; site
**Knorringite: 
**Majorite: 
**Calderite: 

====Knorringite====
Knorringite is a magnesium-chromium garnet species with the formula Mg3Cr2(SiO4)3. Pure endmember knorringite never occurs in nature. Pyrope rich in the knorringite component is only formed under high pressure and is often found in kimberlites. It is used as an indicator mineral in the search for diamonds.

==Synthetic garnets==
Also known as rare-earth garnets.

The crystallographic structure of garnets has been expanded from the prototype to include chemicals with the general formula &quot;A&quot;3&quot;B&quot;2(&quot;C&quot;O4)3. Besides silicon, a large number of elements have been put on the &quot;C&quot; site, including germanium, gallium, aluminum, vanadium and iron.

Yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG), Y3Al2(AlO4)3, is used for synthetic gemstones. Due to its fairly high refractive index, YAG was used as a diamond simulant in the 1970s until the methods of producing the more advanced simulant cubic zirconia in commercial quantities were developed. When doped with neodymium (Nd3+), erbium or gadolinium YAG may be used as the lasing medium in s, s and Gd:YAG lasers respectively. These doped YAG lasers are used in medical procedures including laser skin resurfacing, dentistry, and ophthalmology.

Interesting magnetic properties arise when the appropriate elements are used. In yttrium iron garnet (YIG), Y3Fe2(FeO4)3, the five iron(III) ions occupy two octahedral and three tetrahedral sites, with the yttrium(III) ions coordinated by eight oxygen ions in an irregular cube. The iron ions in the two coordination sites exhibit different spins, resulting in magnetic behavior. YIG is a ferrimagnetic material having a Curie temperature of 550 K. Yttrium iron garnet can be made into YIG spheres, which serve as magnetically tunable filters and resonators for microwave frequencies.

Lutetium aluminium garnet (LuAG), , is an inorganic compound with a unique crystal structure primarily known for its use in high-efficiency laser devices. LuAG is also useful in the synthesis of transparent ceramics. LuAG is particularly favored over other crystals for its high density and thermal conductivity; it has a relatively small lattice constant in comparison to the other rare-earth garnets, which results in a higher density producing a crystal field with narrower linewidths and greater energy level splitting in absorption and emission.

Terbium gallium garnet (TGG), , is a Faraday rotator material with excellent transparency properties and is very resistant to laser damage. TGG can be used in optical isolators for laser systems, in optical circulators for fiber optic systems, in optical modulators, and in current and magnetic field sensors.

Another example is gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG), which is synthesized for use as a substrate for liquid-phase epitaxy of magnetic garnet films for bubble memory and magneto-optical applications.

== Geological importance ==
The mineral garnet is commonly found in metamorphic and to a lesser extent, igneous rocks. Most natural garnets are compositionally zoned and contain inclusions. Its crystal lattice structure is stable at high pressures and temperatures and is thus found in green-schist facies metamorphic rocks including gneiss, hornblende schist, and mica schist. The composition that is stable at the pressure and temperature conditions of Earth&#x27;s mantle is pyrope, which is often found in peridotites and kimberlites, as well as the serpentines that form from them. Garnets are unique in that they can record the pressures and temperatures of peak metamorphism and are used as geobarometers and geothermometers in the study of geothermobarometry which determines &quot;P-T Paths&quot;, Pressure-Temperature Paths. Garnets are used as an index mineral in the delineation of isograds in metamorphic rocks. Compositional zoning and inclusions can mark the change from growth of the crystals at low temperatures to higher temperatures. Garnets that are not compositionally zoned more than likely experienced ultra high temperatures (above 700 °C) that led to diffusion of major elements within the crystal lattice, effectively homogenizing the crystal or they were never zoned. Garnets can also form metamorphic textures that can help interpret structural histories.

In addition to being used to devolve conditions of metamorphism, garnets can be used to date certain geologic events. Garnet has been developed as a U-Pb geochronometer, to date the age of crystallization as well as a thermochronometer in the (U-Th)/He system to date timing of cooling below a closure temperature.

Garnets can be chemically altered and most often alter to serpentine, talc, and chlorite.

===Largest garnet crystal===
The open-pit Barton Garnet Mine, located at Gore Mountain in the Adirondack Mountains, yields the world&#x27;s largest single crystals of garnet; diameters range from 5 to 35 cm and commonly average 10–18 cm.

Gore Mountain garnets are unique in many respects, and considerable effort has been made to determine the timing of garnet growth. The first dating was that of Basu et al. (1989), who used plagioclase-hornblende-garnet to produce a Sm/Nd isochron that yielded an age of 1059 ± 19 Ma. Mezger et al. (1992) conducted their own Sm/Nd investigation using hornblende and the drilled core of a 50 cm garnet to produce an isochron age of 1051 ± 4 Ma. Connelly (2006) utilized seven different fractions of a Gore Mountain garnet to obtain a Lu-Hf isochron age of 1046.6 ± 6 Ma. It is therefore concluded with confidence that the garnets formed at 1049 ± 5 Ma, the average of the three determinations. This is also the local age of peak metamorphism in the 1090–1040 Ma Ottawan phase of the Grenvillian orogeny and serves as a critical data point in ascertaining the evolution of the megacrystic garnet deposits.

==Uses==

===Gemstones===
Red garnets were the most commonly used gemstones in the Late Antique Roman world, and the Migration Period art of the &quot;barbarian&quot; peoples who took over the territory of the Western Roman Empire. They were especially used inlaid in gold cells in the cloisonné technique, a style often just called garnet cloisonné, found from Anglo-Saxon England, as at Sutton Hoo, to the Black Sea. Thousands of Tamraparniyan gold, silver and red garnet shipments were made in the old world, including to Rome, Greece, the Middle East, Serica and Anglo Saxons; recent findings such as the Staffordshire Hoard and the pendant of the Winfarthing Woman skeleton of Norfolk confirm an established gem trade route with South India and Tamraparni (ancient Sri Lanka), known from antiquity for its production of gemstones.

Pure crystals of garnet are still used as gemstones. The gemstone varieties occur in shades of green, red, yellow, and orange. In the United States it is known as the birthstone for January. It is also the birthstone of Aquarius and Capricorn in tropical astrology. The garnet family is one of the most complex in the gem world. It is not a single species, but is composed of multiple species and varieties. 

Almandine garnet is the state mineral of Connecticut, star garnet is the state gemstone of Idaho, garnet is the state gemstone of New York, and grossular garnet is the state gemstone of Vermont.

===Industrial uses===
Garnet sand is a good abrasive, and a common replacement for silica sand in sand blasting. Alluvial garnet grains which are rounder are more suitable for such blasting treatments. Mixed with very high pressure water, garnet is used to cut steel and other materials in water jets. For water jet cutting, garnet extracted from hard rock is suitable since it is more angular in form, therefore more efficient in cutting.

Garnet paper is favored by cabinetmakers for finishing bare wood.

Garnet sand is also used for water filtration media.

As an abrasive, garnet can be broadly divided into two categories; blasting grade and water jet grade. The garnet, as it is mined and collected, is crushed to finer grains; all pieces which are larger than 60 mesh (250 micrometers) are normally used for sand blasting. The pieces between 60 mesh (250 micrometers) and 200 mesh (74 micrometers) are normally used for water jet cutting. The remaining garnet pieces that are finer than 200 mesh (74 micrometers) are used for glass polishing and lapping. Regardless of the application, the larger grain sizes are used for faster work and the smaller ones are used for finer finishes.

There are different kinds of abrasive garnets which can be divided based on their origin. The largest source of abrasive garnet today is garnet-rich beach sand which is quite abundant on Indian and Australian coasts and the main producers today are Australia and India.

This material is particularly popular due to its consistent supplies, huge quantities and clean material. The common problems with this material are the presence of ilmenite and chloride compounds. Since the material has been naturally crushed and ground on the beaches for past centuries, the material is normally available in fine sizes only. Most of the garnet at the Tuticorin beach in south India is 80 mesh, and ranges from 56 mesh to 100 mesh size.

&quot;River garnet&quot; is particularly abundant in Australia. The river sand garnet occurs as a placer deposit.

&quot;Rock garnet&quot; is perhaps the garnet type used for the longest period of time. This type of garnet is produced in America, China and western India. These crystals are crushed in mills and then purified by wind blowing, magnetic separation, sieving and, if required, washing. Being freshly crushed, this garnet has the sharpest edges and therefore performs far better than other kinds of garnet. Both the river and the beach garnet suffer from the tumbling effect of hundreds of thousands of years which rounds off the edges. Gore Mountain Garnet from Warren County, New York, USA, is a significant source of rock garnet for use as an industrial abrasive.

<doc id="37508" wikidata="Q42278" url="?curid=37508" title="Magma">
<text>Magma () is the molten or semi-molten natural material from which all igneous rocks are formed. Magma (sometimes colloquially but incorrectly referred to as &quot;lava&quot;) is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and evidence of magmatism has also been discovered on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals and gas bubbles.

Magma is produced by melting of the mantle or the crust in various tectonic settings, which on Earth include subduction zones, continental rift zones, mid-ocean ridges and hotspots. Mantle and crustal melts migrate upwards through the crust where they are thought to be stored in magma chambers or trans-crustal crystal-rich mush zones. During magma&#x27;s storage in the crust, its composition may be modified by fractional crystallization, contamination with crustal melts, magma mixing, and degassing. Following its ascent through the crust, magma may feed a volcano and be extruded as lava, or it may solidify underground to form an intrusion, such as a dike, a sill, a laccolith, a pluton, or a batholith.

While the study of magma has relied on observing magma after its transition into a lava flow, magma has been encountered in situ three times during geothermal drilling projects, twice in Iceland (see Use in energy production) and once in Hawaii.

==Physical and chemical properties==
Magma consists of liquid rock that usually contains suspended solid crystals. As magma approaches the surface and the overburden pressure drops, dissolved gases bubble out of the liquid, so that magma near the surface consists of materials in solid, liquid, and gas phases.

===Composition===

Most magma is rich in silica. Rare nonsilicate magma can form by local melting of nonsilicate mineral deposits or by separation of a magma into separate immiscible silicate and nonsilicate liquid phases.

Silicate magmas are molten mixtures dominated by oxygen and silicon, the most abundant chemical elements in the Earth&#x27;s crust, with smaller quantities of aluminium, calcium, magnesium, iron, sodium, and potassium, and minor amounts of many other elements. Petrologists routinely express the composition of a silicate magma in terms of the weight or molar mass fraction of the oxides of the major elements (other than oxygen) present in the magma.

Because many of the properties of a magma (such as its viscosity and temperature) are observed to correlate with silica content, silicate magmas are divided into four chemical types based on silica content: &quot;felsic&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, &quot;mafic&quot;, and &quot;ultramafic&quot;.

==== Felsic magmas ====
&quot;Felsic&quot; or silicic magmas have a silica content greater than 63%. They include rhyolite and dacite magmas. With such a high silica content, these magmas are extremely viscous, ranging from 108 cP (105 Pa⋅s) for hot rhyolite magma at to 1011 cP (108 Pa⋅s) for cool rhyolite magma at . For comparison, water has a viscosity of about 1 cP (0.001 Pa⋅s). Because of this very high viscosity, felsic lavas usually erupt explosively to produce pyroclastic (fragmental) deposits. However, rhyolite lavas occasionally erupt effusively to form lava spines, lava domes or &quot;coulees&quot; (which are thick, short lava flows). The lavas typically fragment as they extrude, producing block lava flows. These often contain obsidian.

Felsic lavas can erupt at temperatures as low as . Unusually hot (&gt;950 °C; &gt;1,740 °F) rhyolite lavas, however, may flow for distances of many tens of kilometres, such as in the Snake River Plain of the northwestern United States.

==== Intermediate magmas ====
&quot;Intermediate&quot; or andesitic magmas contain 52% to 63% silica, and are lower in aluminium and usually somewhat richer in magnesium and iron than felsic magmas. Intermediate lavas form andesite domes and block lavas, and may occur on steep composite volcanoes, such as in the Andes. They are also commonly hotter, in the range of ). Because of their lower silica content and higher eruptive temperatures, they tend to be much less viscous, with a typical viscosity of 3.5 × 106 cP (3,500 Pa⋅s) at . This is slightly greater than the viscosity of smooth peanut butter. Intermediate magmas show a greater tendency to form phenocrysts. Higher iron and magnesium tends to manifest as a darker groundmass, including amphibole or pyroxene phenocrysts.

==== Mafic magmas ====
&quot;Mafic&quot; or basaltic magmas have a silica content of 52% to 45%. They are typified by their high ferromagnesian content, and generally erupt at temperatures of . Viscosities can be relatively low, around 104 to 105 cP (10 to 100 Pa⋅s), although this is still many orders of magnitude higher than water. This viscosity is similar to that of ketchup. Basalt lavas tend to produce low-profile shield volcanoes or flood basalts, because the fluidal lava flows for long distances from the vent. The thickness of a basalt lava, particularly on a low slope, may be much greater than the thickness of the moving lava flow at any one time, because basalt lavas may &quot;inflate&quot; by supply of lava beneath a solidified crust. Most basalt lavas are of &quot;ʻAʻā&quot; or &quot;pāhoehoe&quot; types, rather than block lavas. Underwater, they can form pillow lavas, which are rather similar to entrail-type pahoehoe lavas on land.

==== Ultramafic magmas ====
&quot;Ultramafic&quot; magmas, such as picritic basalt, komatiite, and highly magnesian magmas that form boninite, take the composition and temperatures to the extreme. All have a silica content under 45%. Komatiites contain over 18% magnesium oxide, and are thought to have erupted at temperatures of . At this temperature there is practically no polymerization of the mineral compounds, creating a highly mobile liquid. Viscosities of komatiite magmas are thought to have been as low as 100 to 1000 cP (0.1 to 1 Pa⋅s), similar to that of light motor oil. Most ultramafic lavas are no younger than the Proterozoic, with a few ultramafic magmas known from the Phanerozoic in Central America that are attributed to a hot mantle plume. No modern komatiite lavas are known, as the Earth&#x27;s mantle has cooled too much to produce highly magnesian magmas.

==== Alkaline magmas ====

Some silicic magmas have an elevated content of alkali metal oxides (sodium and potassium), particularly in regions of continental rifting, areas overlying deeply subducted plates, or at intraplate hotspots. Their silica content can range from ultramafic (nephelinites, basanites and tephrites) to felsic (trachytes). They are more likely to be generated at greater depths in the mantle than subalkaline magmas. Olivine nephelinite magmas are both ultramafic and highly alkaline, and are thought to have come from much deeper in the mantle of the Earth than other magmas.
==== Non-silicate magmas ====
Some lavas of unusual composition have erupted onto the surface of the Earth. These include:
* Carbonatite and natrocarbonatite lavas are known from Ol Doinyo Lengai volcano in Tanzania, which is the sole example of an active carbonatite volcano. Carbonatites in the geologic record are typically 75% carbonate minerals, with lesser amounts of silica-undersaturated silicate minerals (such as micas and olivine), apatite, magnetite, and pyrochlore. This may not reflect the original composition of the lava, which may have included sodium carbonate that was subsequently removed by hydrothermal activity, though laboratory experiments show that a calcite-rich magma is possible. Carbonatite lavas show stable isotope ratios indicating they are derived from the highly alkaline silicic lavas with which they are always associated, probably by separation of an immiscible phase. Natrocarbonatite lavas of Ol Doinyo Lengai are composed mostly of sodium carbonate, with about half as much calcium carbonate and half again as much potassium carbonate, and minor amounts of halides, fluorides, and sulphates. The lavas are extremely fluid, with viscosities only slightly greater than water, and are very cool, with measured temperatures of .
* Iron oxide magmas are thought to be the source of the iron ore at Kiruna, Sweden which formed during the Proterozoic. Iron oxide lavas of Pliocene age occur at the El Laco volcanic complex on the Chile-Argentina border. Iron oxide lavas are thought to be the result of immiscible separation of iron oxide magma from a parental magma of calc-alkaline or alkaline composition. When erupted, the temperature of the molten iron oxide magma is about .
* Sulfur lava flows up to long and wide occur at Lastarria volcano, Chile. They were formed by the melting of sulfur deposits at temperatures as low as .

=== Magmatic gases ===

The concentrations of different gases can vary considerably. Water vapor is typically the most abundant magmatic gas, followed by carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Other principal magmatic gases include hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen chloride, and hydrogen fluoride.

The solubility of magmatic gases in magma depends on pressure, magma composition, and temperature. Magma that is extruded as lava is extremely dry, but magma at depth and under great pressure can contain a dissolved water content in excess of 10%. Water is somewhat less soluble in low-silica magma than high-silica magma, so that at 1,100 °C and 0.5 GPa, a basaltic magma can dissolve 8% while a granite pegmatite magma can dissolve 11% . However, magmas are not necessarily saturated under typical conditions.

Carbon dioxide is much less soluble in magmas than water, and frequently separates into a distinct fluid phase even at great depth. This explains the presence of carbon dioxide fluid inclusions in crystals formed in magmas at great depth.

=== Rheology ===

Viscosity is a key melt property in understanding the behaviour of magmas. Whereas temperatures in common silicate lavas range from about for felsic lavas to for mafic lavas, the viscosity of the same lavas ranges over seven orders of magnitude, from 104 cP (10 Pa⋅s) for mafic lava to 1011 cP (108 Pa⋅s) for felsic magmas. The viscosity is mostly determined by composition but is also dependent on temperature. The tendency of felsic lava to be cooler than mafic lava increases the viscosity difference.

The silicon ion is small and highly charged, and so it has a strong tendency to coordinate with four oxygen ions, which form a tetrahedral arrangement around the much smaller silicon ion. This is called a &quot;silica tetrahedron&quot;. In a magma that is low in silicon, these silica tetrahedra are isolated, but as the silicon content increases, silica tetrahedra begin to partially polymerize, forming chains, sheets, and clumps of silica tetrahedra linked by bridging oxygen ions. These greatly increase the viscosity of the magma.

The tendency towards polymerization is expressed as NBO/T, where NBO is the number of non-bridging oxygen ions and T is the number of network-forming ions. Silicon is the main network-forming ion, but in magmas high in sodium, aluminium also acts as a network former, and ferric iron can act as a network former when other network formers are lacking. Most other metallic ions reduce the tendency to polymerize and are described as network modifiers. In a hypothetical magma formed entirely from melted silica, NBO/T would be 0, while in a hypothetical magma so low in network formers that no polymerization takes place, NBO/T would be 4. Neither extreme is common in nature, but basalt magmas typically have NBO/T between 0.6 and 0.9, andesitic magmas have NBO/T of 0.3 to 0.5, and rhyolitic magmas have NBO/T of 0.02 to 0.2. Water acts as a network modifier, and dissolved water drastically reduces melt viscosity. Carbon dioxide neutralizes network modifiers, so dissolved carbon dioxide increases the viscosity. Higher-temperature melts are less viscous, since more thermal energy is available to break bonds between oxygen and network formers.

Most magmas contain solid crystals of various minerals, fragments of exotic rocks known as xenoliths and fragments of previously solidified magma. The crystal content of most magmas gives them thixotropic and shear thinning properties. In other words, most magmas do not behave like Newtonian fluids, in which the rate of flow is proportional to the shear stress. Instead, a typical magma is a Bingham fluid, which shows considerable resistance to flow until a stress threshold, called the yield stress, is crossed. This results in plug flow of partially crystalline magma. A familiar example of plug flow is toothpaste squeezed out of a toothpaste tube. The toothpaste comes out as a semisolid plug, because shear is concentrated in a thin layer in the toothpaste next to the tube, and only here does the toothpaste behave as a fluid. Thixotropic behavior also hinders crystals from settling out of the magma. Once the crystal content reaches about 60%, the magma ceases to behave like a fluid and begins to behave like a solid. Such a mixture of crystals with melted rock is sometimes described as &quot;crystal mush&quot;.

Magma is typically also viscoelastic, meaning it flows like a liquid under low stresses, but once the applied stress exceeds a critical value, the melt cannot dissipate the stress fast enough through relaxation alone, resulting in transient fracture propagation. Once stresses are reduced below the critical threshold, the melt viscously relaxes once more and heals the fracture.

=== Temperature ===
Temperatures of molten lava, which is magma extruded onto the surface, are almost all in the range , but very rare carbonatite magmas may be as cool as , and komatiite magmas may have been as hot as . Magma has occasionally been encountered during drilling in geothermal fields, including drilling in Hawaii that penetrated a dacitic magma body at a depth of . The temperature of this magma was estimated at . Temperatures of deeper magmas must be inferred from theoretical computations and the geothermal gradient.

Most magmas contain some solid crystals suspended in the liquid phase. This indicates that the temperature of the magma lies between the solidus, which is defined as the temperature at which the magma completely solidifies, and the liquidus, defined as the temperature at which the magma is completely liquid. Calculations of solidus temperatures at likely depths suggests that magma generated beneath areas of rifting starts at a temperature of about . Magma generated from mantle plumes may be as hot as . The temperature of magma generated in subduction zones, where water vapor lowers the melting temperature, may be as low as .

=== Density ===
Magma densities depend mostly on composition, iron content being the most important parameter.
Magma expands slightly at lower pressure or higher temperature. When magma approaches the surface, its dissolved gases begin to bubble out of the liquid. These bubbles had significantly reduced the density of the magma at depth and helped drive it toward the surface in the first place.

== Origins ==

The temperature within the interior of the earth is described by the geothermal gradient, which is the rate of temperature change with depth. The geothermal gradient is established by the balance between heating through radioactive decay in the Earth&#x27;s interior and heat loss from the surface of the earth. The geothermal gradient averages about 25 °C/km in the Earth&#x27;s upper crust, but this varies widely by region, from a low of 5–10 °C/km within oceanic trenches and subduction zones to 30–80 °C/km along mid-ocean ridges or near mantle plumes. The gradient becomes less steep with depth, dropping to just 0.25 to 0.3 °C/km in the mantle, where slow convection efficiently transports heat. The average geothermal gradient is not normally steep enough to bring rocks to their melting point anywhere in the crust or upper mantle, so magma is produced only where the geothermal gradient is unusually steep or the melting point of the rock is unusually low. However, the ascent of magma towards the surface in such settings is the most important process for transporting heat through the crust of the Earth.

Rocks may melt in response to a decrease in pressure, to a change in composition (such as an addition of water), to an increase in temperature, or to a combination of these processes. Other mechanisms, such as melting from a meteorite impact, are less important today, but impacts during the accretion of the Earth led to extensive melting, and the outer several hundred kilometers of the early Earth was probably a magma ocean. Impacts of large meteorites in the last few hundred million years have been proposed as one mechanism responsible for the extensive basalt magmatism of several large igneous provinces.

=== Decompression ===

Decompression melting occurs because of a decrease in pressure. It is the most important mechanism for producing magma from the upper mantle.

The solidus temperatures of most rocks (the temperatures below which they are completely solid) increase with increasing pressure in the absence of water. Peridotite at depth in the Earth&#x27;s mantle may be hotter than its solidus temperature at some shallower level. If such rock rises during the convection of solid mantle, it will cool slightly as it expands in an adiabatic process, but the cooling is only about 0.3 °C per kilometer. Experimental studies of appropriate peridotite samples document that the solidus temperatures increase by 3 °C to 4 °C per kilometer. If the rock rises far enough, it will begin to melt. Melt droplets can coalesce into larger volumes and be intruded upwards. This process of melting from the upward movement of solid mantle is critical in the evolution of the Earth.

Decompression melting creates the ocean crust at mid-ocean ridges, making it by far the most important source of magma on Earth. It also causes volcanism in intraplate regions, such as Europe, Africa and the Pacific sea floor. Intraplate volcanism is attributed to the rise of mantle plumes or to intraplate extension, with the importance of each mechanism being a topic of continuing research.

=== Effects of water and carbon dioxide ===
The change of rock composition most responsible for the creation of magma is the addition of water. Water lowers the solidus temperature of rocks at a given pressure. For example, at a depth of about 100 kilometers, peridotite begins to melt near 800 °C in the presence of excess water, but near 1,500 °C in the absence of water. Water is driven out of the oceanic lithosphere in subduction zones, and it causes melting in the overlying mantle. Hydrous magmas with the composition of basalt or andesite are produced directly and indirectly as results of dehydration during the subduction process. Such magmas, and those derived from them, build up island arcs such as those in the Pacific Ring of Fire. These magmas form rocks of the calc-alkaline series, an important part of the continental crust. With low density and viscosity, hydrous magmas are highly buoyant and will move upwards in Earth&#x27;s mantle.

The addition of carbon dioxide is relatively a much less important cause of magma formation than the addition of water, but genesis of some silica-undersaturated magmas has been attributed to the dominance of carbon dioxide over water in their mantle source regions. In the presence of carbon dioxide, experiments document that the peridotite solidus temperature decreases by about 200 °C in a narrow pressure interval at pressures corresponding to a depth of about 70 km. At greater depths, carbon dioxide can have more effect: at depths to about 200 km, the temperatures of initial melting of a carbonated peridotite composition were determined to be 450 °C to 600 °C lower than for the same composition with no carbon dioxide. Magmas of rock types such as nephelinite, carbonatite, and kimberlite are among those that may be generated following an influx of carbon dioxide into mantle at depths greater than about 70 km.

=== Temperature increase ===
Increase in temperature is the most typical mechanism for formation of magma within continental crust. Such temperature increases can occur because of the upward intrusion of magma from the mantle. Temperatures can also exceed the solidus of a crustal rock in continental crust thickened by compression at a plate boundary. The plate boundary between the Indian and Asian continental masses provides a well-studied example, as the Tibetan Plateau just north of the boundary has crust about 80 kilometers thick, roughly twice the thickness of normal continental crust. Studies of electrical resistivity deduced from magnetotelluric data have detected a layer that appears to contain silicate melt and that stretches for at least 1,000 kilometers within the middle crust along the southern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. Granite and rhyolite are types of igneous rock commonly interpreted as products of the melting of continental crust because of increases in temperature. Temperature increases also may contribute to the melting of lithosphere dragged down in a subduction zone.

=== The melting process ===
When rocks melt, they do so over a range of temperature, because most rocks are made of several minerals, which all have different melting points. The temperature at which the first melt appears (the solidus) is lower than the melting temperature of any one of the pure minerals. This is similar to the lowering of the melting point of ice when it is mixed with salt. The first melt is called the &quot;eutectic&quot; and has a composition that depends on the combination of minerals present.

For example, a mixture of anorthite and diopside, which are two of the predominant minerals in basalt, begins to melt at about 1274 °C. This is well below the melting temperatures of 1392 °C for pure diopside and 1553 °C for pure anorthite. The resulting melt is composed of about 43 wt% anorthite. As additional heat is added to the rock, the temperature remains at 1274 °C until either the anorthite or diopside is fully melted. The temperature then rises as the remaining mineral continues to melt, which shifts the melt composition away from the eutectic. For example, if the content of anorthite is greater than 43%, the entire supply of diopside will melt at 1274 °C., along with enough of the anorthite to keep the melt at the eutectic composition. Further heating causes the temperature to slowly rise as the remaining anorthite gradually melts and the melt becomes increasingly rich in anorthite liquid. If the mixture has only a slight excess of anorthite, this will melt before the temperature rises much above 1274 °C. If the mixture is almost all anorthite, the temperature will reach nearly the melting point of pure anorthite before all the anorthite is melted. If the anorthite content of the mixture is less than 43%, then all the anorthite will melt at the eutectic temperature, along with part of the diopside, and the remaining diopside will then gradually melt as the temperature continues to rise.

Because of eutectic melting, the composition of the melt can be quite different from the source rock. For example, a mixture of 10% anorthite with diopside could experience about 23% partial melting before the melt deviated from the eutectic, which has the composition of about 43% anorthite. This effect of partial melting is reflected in the compositions of different magmas. A low degree of partial melting of the upper mantle (2% to 4%) can produce highly alkaline magmas such as melilitites, while a greater degree of partial melting (8% to 11%) can produce alkali olivine basalt. Oceanic magmas likely result from partial melting of 3% to 15% of the source rock. Some calk-alkaline granitoids may be produced by a high degree of partial melting, as much as 15% to 30%.
High-magnesium magmas, such as komatiite and picrite, may also be the products of a high degree of partial melting of mantle rock.

Certain chemical elements, called incompatible elements, have a combination of ionic radius and ionic charge that is unlike that of the more abundant elements in the source rock. The ions of these elements fit rather poorly in the structure of the minerals making up the source rock, and readily leave the solid minerals to become highly concentrated in melts produced by a low degree of partial melting. Incompatible elements commonly include potassium, barium, caesium, and rubidium, which are large and weakly charged (the large-ion lithophile elements, or LILEs), as well as elements whose ions carry a high charge (the high-field-strength elements, or HSFEs), which include such elements as zirconium, niobium, hafnium, tantalum, the rare-earth elements, and the actinides. Potassium can become so enriched in melt produced by a very low degree of partial melting that, when the magma subsequently cools and solidifies, it forms unusual potassic rock such as lamprophyre, lamproite, or kimberlite.

When enough rock is melted, the small globules of melt (generally occurring between mineral grains) link up and soften the rock. Under pressure within the earth, as little as a fraction of a percent of partial melting may be sufficient to cause melt to be squeezed from its source. Melt rapidly separates from its source rock once the degree of partial melting exceeds 30%. However, usually much less than 30% of a magma source rock is melted before the heat supply is exhausted.

Pegmatite may be produced by low degrees of partial melting of the crust. Some granite-composition magmas are eutectic (or cotectic) melts, and they may be produced by low to high degrees of partial melting of the crust, as well as by fractional crystallization.

== Evolution of magmas ==
Most magmas are fully melted only for small parts of their histories. More typically, they are mixes of melt and crystals, and sometimes also of gas bubbles. Melt, crystals, and bubbles usually have different densities, and so they can separate as magmas evolve.

As magma cools, minerals typically crystallize from the melt at different temperatures. This resembles the original melting process in reverse. However, because the melt has usually separated from its original source rock and moved to a shallower depth, the reverse process of crystallization is not precisely identical. For example, if a melt was 50% each of diopside and anorthite, then anorthite would begin crystallizing from the melt at a temperature somewhat higher than the eutectic temperature of 1274 °C. This shifts the remaining melt towards its eutectic composition of 43% diopside. The eutectic is reached at 1274 °C, the temperature at which diopside and anorthite begin crystallizing together. If the melt was 90% diopside, the diopside would begin crystallizing first until the eutectic was reached.

If the crystals remained suspended in the melt, the crystallization process would not change the overall composition of the melt plus solid minerals. This situation is described as &quot;equillibrium crystallization&quot;. However, in a series of experiments culminating in his 1915 paper, &quot;Crystallization-differentiation in silicate liquids&quot;, Norman L. Bowen demonstrated that crystals of olivine and diopside that crystallized out of a cooling melt of forsterite, diopside, and silica would sink through the melt on geologically relevant time scales. Geologists subsequently found considerable field evidence of such &quot;fractional crystallization&quot;.

When crystals separate from a magma, then the residual magma will differ in composition from the parent magma. For instance, a magma of gabbroic composition can produce a residual melt of granitic composition if early formed crystals are separated from the magma. Gabbro may have a liquidus temperature near 1,200 °C, and the derivative granite-composition melt may have a liquidus temperature as low as about 700 °C. Incompatible elements are concentrated in the last residues of magma during fractional crystallization and in the first melts produced during partial melting: either process can form the magma that crystallizes to pegmatite, a rock type commonly enriched in incompatible elements. Bowen&#x27;s reaction series is important for understanding the idealised sequence of fractional crystallisation of a magma.

Magma composition can be determined by processes other than partial melting and fractional crystallization. For instance, magmas commonly interact with rocks they intrude, both by melting those rocks and by reacting with them. Assimilation near the roof of a magma chamber and fractional crystallization near its base can even take place simultaneously. Magmas of different compositions can mix with one another. In rare cases, melts can separate into two immiscible melts of contrasting compositions.

=== Primary magmas ===
When rock melts, the liquid is a &quot;primary magma&quot;. Primary magmas have not undergone any differentiation and represent the starting composition of a magma. In practice, it is difficult to unambiguously identify primary magmas, though it has been suggested that boninite is a variety of andesite crystallized from a primary magma. The Great Dyke of Zimbabwe has also been interpreted as rock crystallized from a primary magma. The interpretation of leucosomes of migmatites as primary magmas is contradicted by zircon data, which suggests leucosomes are a residue (a cumulate rock) left by extraction of a primary magma.

=== Parental magma ===
When it is impossible to find the primitive or primary magma composition, it is often useful to attempt to identify a parental magma. A parental magma is a magma composition from which the observed range of magma chemistries has been derived by the processes of igneous differentiation. It need not be a primitive melt.

For instance, a series of basalt flows are assumed to be related to one another. A composition from which they could reasonably be produced by fractional crystallization is termed a &quot;parental magma&quot;. Fractional crystallization models would be produced to test the hypothesis that they share a common parental magma.

== Migration and solidification ==
Magma develops within the mantle or crust where the temperature and pressure conditions favor the molten state. After its formation, magma buoyantly rises toward the Earth&#x27;s surface, due to its lower density than the source rock. As it migrates through the crust, magma may collect and reside in magma chambers (though recent work suggests that magma may be stored in trans-crustal crystal-rich mush zones rather than dominantly liquid magma chambers ). Magma can remain in a chamber until it either cools and crystallizes to form intrusive rock, it erupts as a volcano, or it moves into another magma chamber.

=== Plutonism ===
When magma cools it begins to form solid mineral phases. Some of these settle at the bottom of the magma chamber forming cumulates that might form mafic layered intrusions. Magma that cools slowly within a magma chamber usually ends up forming bodies of plutonic rocks such as gabbro, diorite and granite, depending upon the composition of the magma. Alternatively, if the magma is erupted it forms volcanic rocks such as basalt, andesite and rhyolite (the extrusive equivalents of gabbro, diorite and granite, respectively).

=== Volcanism ===

Magma that is extruded onto the surface during a volcanic eruption is called lava. Lava cools and solidifies relatively quickly compared to underground bodies of magma. This fast cooling does not allow crystals to grow large, and a part of the melt does not crystallize at all, becoming glass. Rocks largely composed of volcanic glass include obsidian, scoria and pumice.

Before and during volcanic eruptions, volatiles such as CO2 and H2O partially leave the melt through a process known as exsolution. Magma with low water content becomes increasingly viscous. If massive exsolution occurs when magma heads upwards during a volcanic eruption, the resulting eruption is usually explosive.

== Use in energy production ==
The Iceland Deep Drilling Project, while drilling several 5,000 m holes in an attempt to harness the heat in the volcanic bedrock below the surface of Iceland, struck a pocket of magma at 2,100 m in 2009. Because this was only the third time in recorded history that magma had been reached, IDDP decided to invest in the hole, naming it IDDP-1.

A cemented steel case was constructed in the hole with a perforation at the bottom close to the magma. The high temperatures and pressure of the magma steam were used to generate 36 MW of power, making IDDP-1 the world&#x27;s first magma-enhanced geothermal system.

<text>Respiration may refer to:

== Biology ==
* Cellular respiration, the process in which nutrients are converted into useful energy in a cell
** Anaerobic respiration, cellular respiration without oxygen 
** Maintenance respiration, the amount of cellular respiration required for an organism to maintain itself in a constant state
* Respiration (physiology), transporting oxygen and carbon dioxide between cells and the external environment
** Respiratory system, the anatomical system of an organism used for respiration
** Breathing, passing air in and out through respiratory organs
** Aquatic respiration, animals extracting oxygen from water
** Artificial respiration, the act of simulating respiration, which provides for the overall exchange of gases in the body by pulmonary ventilation, external respiration and internal respiration
** Cheyne–Stokes respiration, an abnormal pattern of breathing characterized by progressively deeper and sometimes faster breathing, followed by a gradual decrease that results in a temporary stop in breathing called an apnea
* &quot;Respiration&quot;, a journal by Karger Publishers

== Ecology ==
* Carbon respiration, a concept used in calculating carbon (as ) flux occurring in the atmosphere
* Ecosystem respiration, measurement of gross carbon dioxide production by all organisms in an ecosystem
* Root respiration, exchange of gases between plant roots and the atmosphere
* Photorespiration, enzymatic combination of RuBP with oxygen

== Entertainment ==
* &quot;Respiration&quot; (song), a 1999 single by Black Star 
* &quot;Respire&quot; (song), a 2003 song by Mickey 3D
* &quot;Respire&quot; (film), a 2014 French drama film

<text>An adjective (abbreviated adj.) is a word that describes or defines a noun or noun phrase. Its semantic role is to change information given by the noun.

Traditionally, adjectives are considered one of the main parts of speech of the English language, although historically they were classed together with nouns. Nowadays, certain words that usually had been classified as adjectives, including &quot;the&quot;, &quot;this&quot;, &quot;my&quot;, etc., typically are classed separately, as determiners.

Examples:
* That&#x27;s a &quot;funny&quot; idea. (Attributive)
* That idea is &quot;funny&quot;. (Predicative)
* The &quot;good&quot;, the &quot;bad&quot;, and the &quot;funny&quot;. (Substantive)
* Clara Oswald died &quot;three&quot; times. (Quantitative)

==Etymology==

&quot;Adjective&quot; comes from Latin &quot;&quot;, a calque of (whence also English &quot;epithet&quot;). In the grammatical tradition of Latin and Greek, because adjectives were inflected for gender, number, and case like nouns (a process called declension), they were considered a type of noun. The words that are today typically called nouns were then called &quot;substantive nouns&quot; (). The terms &quot;noun substantive&quot; and &quot;noun adjective&quot; were formerly used in English but are now obsolete.

==Types of use==

Depending on the language, an adjective can precede a corresponding noun on a prepositive basis or it can follow a corresponding noun on a postpositive basis. Structural, contextual, and style considerations can impinge on the pre-or post-position of an adjective in a given instance of its occurrence. In English, occurrences of adjectives generally can be classified into one of three categories:
* &quot;Prepositive adjectives&quot;, which are also known as &quot;attributive adjectives&quot;, occur on an antecedent basis within noun phrases. For example: &quot;I put my &quot;happy kids&quot; into the car&quot;, wherein &quot;happy&quot; occurs on an antecedent basis within the &quot;my happy kids&quot; noun phrase, and therefore functions in a prepositive adjective.
* &quot;Postpositive adjectives&quot; can occur: immediately subsequent to a noun within a noun phrase, e.g. &quot;The only &quot;room available&quot; cost twice what we expected&quot;; as linked via a copula or other linking mechanism subsequent to a corresponding noun or pronoun; for example: &quot;My kids are happy&quot;, wherein &quot;happy&quot; is a predicate adjective (see also: Predicative expression, Subject complement); or as an appositive adjective within a noun phrase, e.g. &quot;My &quot;kids, [who are] happy&quot; to go for a drive, are in the back seat.&quot;
* &quot;Nominalized adjectives&quot;, which function as nouns. One way this happens is by eliding a noun from an adjective-noun noun phrase, whose remnant thus is a nominalization. In the sentence, &quot;I read two books to them; he preferred the sad book, but she preferred the happy&quot;, &quot;happy&quot; is a nominalized adjective, short for &quot;happy one&quot; or &quot;happy book&quot;. Another way this happens is in phrases like &quot;out with the old, in with the new&quot;, where &quot;the old&quot; means &quot;that which is old&quot; or &quot;all that is old&quot;, and similarly with &quot;the new&quot;. In such cases, the adjective may function as a mass noun (as in the preceding example). In English, it may also function as a plural count noun denoting a collective group, as in &quot;The meek shall inherit the Earth&quot;, where &quot;the meek&quot; means &quot;those who are meek&quot; or &quot;all who are meek&quot;.

==Distribution==
Adjectives feature as a part of speech (word class) in most languages. In some languages, the words that serve the semantic function of adjectives are categorized together with some other class, such as nouns or verbs. In the phrase &quot;a Ford car&quot;, &quot;Ford&quot; is unquestionably a noun but its function is adjectival: to modify &quot;car&quot;. In some languages adjectives can function as nouns: for example, the Spanish phrase &quot;&quot; means &quot;a red [one]&quot;.

As for &quot;confusion&quot; with verbs, rather than an adjective meaning &quot;big&quot;, a language might have a verb that means &quot;to be big&quot; and could then use an attributive verb construction analogous to &quot;big-being house&quot; to express what in English is called a &quot;big house&quot;. Such an analysis is possible for the grammar of Standard Chinese and Korean, for example.

Different languages do not use adjectives in exactly the same situations. For example, where English uses &quot;&quot;&quot;to be &quot;hungry&quot;&quot; (&quot;hungry&quot; being an adjective), Dutch, French, and Spanish use &quot;, &quot;, and &quot;&quot; respectively (literally &quot;to have hunger&quot;, the words for &quot;hunger&quot; being nouns). Similarly, where Hebrew uses the adjective (, roughly &quot;in need of&quot; or &quot;needing&quot;), English uses the verb &quot;to need&quot;.

In languages that have adjectives as a word class, it is usually an open class; that is, it is relatively common for new adjectives to be formed via such processes as derivation. However, Bantu languages are well known for having only a small closed class of adjectives, and new adjectives are not easily derived. Similarly, native Japanese adjectives (&quot;i&quot;-adjectives) are considered a closed class (as are native verbs), although nouns (an open class) may be used in the genitive to convey some adjectival meanings, and there is also the separate open class of adjectival nouns (&quot;na&quot;-adjectives).

==Adverbs==
Many languages (including English) distinguish between adjectives, which qualify nouns and pronouns, and adverbs, which mainly modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Not all languages make this exact distinction; many (including English) have words that can function as either. For example, in English, &quot;fast&quot; is an adjective in &quot;a &quot;fast&quot; car&quot; (where it qualifies the noun &quot;car&quot;) but an adverb in &quot;he drove &quot;fast&quot;&quot; (where it modifies the verb &quot;drove&quot;).

In Dutch and German, adjectives and adverbs are usually identical in form and many grammarians do not make the distinction, but patterns of inflection can suggest a difference:
::A &quot;clever&quot; new idea.
::A &quot;cleverly&quot; developed idea.
A German word like (&quot;clever(ly)&quot;) takes endings when used as an attributive adjective but not when used adverbially. Whether these are distinct parts of speech or distinct usages of the same part of speech is a question of analysis. While German linguistic terminology distinguishes from , German refers to both as (&quot;property words&quot;).

==Determiners==
Linguists today distinguish determiners from adjectives, considering them to be two separate parts of speech (or &quot;lexical categories&quot;). Determiners formerly were considered to be adjectives in some of their uses. Determiners function neither as nouns nor pronouns but instead characterize a nominal element within a particular context. They generally do this by indicating definiteness (&quot;a&quot; vs. &quot;the&quot;), quantity (&quot;one&quot; vs. &quot;some&quot; vs. &quot;many&quot;), or another such property.

==Adjective phrases==
An adjective acts as the head of an &quot;adjective phrase&quot; or &quot;adjectival phrase&quot; (AP). In the simplest case, an adjective phrase consists solely of the adjective; more complex adjective phrases may contain one or more adverbs modifying the adjective (&quot;&quot;very&quot; strong&quot;), or one or more complements (such as &quot;worth &quot;several dollars&quot;&quot;, &quot;full &quot;of toys&quot;&quot;, or &quot;eager &quot;to please&quot;&quot;). In English, attributive adjective phrases that include complements typically follow the noun that they qualify (&quot;an evildoer &quot;devoid of redeeming qualities&quot;&quot;).

==Other modifiers of nouns==
In many languages (including English) it is possible for nouns to modify other nouns. Unlike adjectives, nouns acting as modifiers (called &quot;attributive nouns&quot; or &quot;noun adjuncts&quot;) usually are not predicative; a beautiful park is beautiful, but a car park is not &quot;car&quot;. The modifier often indicates origin (&quot;&quot;Virginia&quot; reel&quot;), purpose (&quot;&quot;work&quot; clothes&quot;), semantic patient (&quot;&quot;man&quot; eater&quot;) or semantic subject (&quot;&quot;child&quot; actor&quot;); however, it may generally indicate almost any semantic relationship. It is also common for adjectives to be derived from nouns, as in &quot;boyish&quot;, &quot;birdlike&quot;, &quot;behavioral (behavioural)&quot;, &quot;famous&quot;, &quot;manly&quot;, &quot;angelic&quot;, and so on.

In Australian Aboriginal languages, the distinction between adjectives and nouns is typically thought weak, and many of the languages only use nouns—or nouns with a limited set of adjective-deriving affixes—to modify other nouns. In languages that have a subtle adjective-noun distinction, one way to tell them apart is that a modifying adjective can come to stand in for an entire elided noun phrase, while a modifying noun cannot. For example, in Bardi, the adjective &quot;moorrooloo&quot; &#x27;little&#x27; in the phrase &quot;moorrooloo&quot; &quot;baawa&quot; &#x27;little child&#x27; can stand on its own to mean &#x27;the little one,&#x27; while the attributive noun &quot;aamba&quot; &#x27;man&#x27; in the phrase &quot;aamba baawa&quot; &#x27;male child&#x27; cannot stand for the whole phrase to mean &#x27;the male one.&#x27; In other languages, like Warlpiri, nouns and adjectives are lumped together beneath the nominal umbrella because of their shared syntactic distribution as arguments of predicates. The only thing distinguishing them is that some nominals seem to semantically denote entities (typically nouns in English) and some nominals seem to denote attributes (typically adjectives in English).

Many languages have participle forms that can act as noun modifiers either alone or as the head of a phrase. Sometimes participles develop into functional usage as adjectives. Examples in English include &quot;relieved&quot; (the past participle of &quot;relieve&quot;), used as an adjective in passive voice constructs such as &quot;I am so &quot;relieved&quot; to see you&quot;. Other examples include &quot;spoken&quot; (the past participle of &quot;speak&quot;) and &quot;going&quot; (the present participle of &quot;go&quot;), which function as attribute adjectives in such phrases as &quot;the &quot;spoken&quot; word&quot; and &quot;the &quot;going&quot; rate&quot;.

Other constructs that often modify nouns include prepositional phrases (as in &quot;a rebel &quot;without a cause&quot;&quot;), relative clauses (as in &quot;the man &quot;who wasn&#x27;t there&quot;&quot;), and infinitive phrases (as in &quot;a cake &quot;to die for&quot;&quot;). Some nouns can also take complements such as content clauses (as in &quot;the idea &quot;that I would do that&quot;&quot;), but these are not commonly considered modifiers. For more information about possible modifiers and dependents of nouns, see Components of noun phrases.

==Order==
In many languages, attributive adjectives usually occur in a specific order. In general, the adjective order in English can be summarised as: opinion, size, age or shape, colour, origin, material, purpose. Other language authorities, like the &quot;Cambridge Dictionary&quot;, state that shape precedes rather than follows age.

Determiners and postdeterminers—articles, numerals, and other limiters (e.g. &quot;three&quot; blind mice)—come before attributive adjectives in English. Although certain combinations of determiners can appear before a noun, they are far more circumscribed than adjectives in their use—typically, only a single determiner would appear before a noun or noun phrase (including any attributive adjectives).

# Opinion – limiter adjectives (e.g. a &quot;real&quot; hero, a &quot;perfect&quot; idiot) and adjectives of subjective measure (e.g. &quot;beautiful&quot;, &quot;supportive&quot;) or value (e.g. &quot;good&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;, &quot;costly&quot;)
# Size – adjectives denoting physical size (e.g. &quot;tiny&quot;, &quot;big&quot;, &quot;extensive&quot;)
# Age – adjectives denoting age (e.g. &quot;young&quot;, &quot;old&quot;, &quot;new&quot;, &quot;ancient&quot;, &quot;six-year-old&quot;)
# Shape or physical quality – adjectives describing more detailed physical attributes than overall size (e.g. &quot;round&quot;, &quot;sharp&quot;, &quot;turgid&quot;, &quot;thin&quot;)
# Colour – adjectives denoting colour or pattern (e.g. &quot;white&quot;, &quot;black&quot;, &quot;pale&quot;, &quot;splotchy&quot;)
# Origin – denominal adjectives denoting source (e.g. &quot;Japanese&quot;, &quot;volcanic&quot;, &quot;extraterrestrial&quot;)
# Material – denominal adjectives denoting what something is made of (e.g., &quot;plastic&quot;, &quot;metallic&quot;, &quot;wooden&quot;)
# Qualifier/purpose – final limiter, which sometimes forms part of the (compound) noun (e.g., &quot;high&quot; chair, &quot;northern&quot; cabin, &quot;passenger&quot; car, &quot;book&quot; cover)

This means that, in English, adjectives pertaining to size precede adjectives pertaining to age (&quot;little old&quot;, not &quot;old little&quot;), which in turn generally precede adjectives pertaining to colour (&quot;old white&quot;, not &quot;white old&quot;). So, one would say &quot;One (quantity) nice (opinion) little (size) old (age) round (shape) [&quot;or&quot; round old] white (colour) brick (material) house.&quot; When several adjectives of the same type are used together, they are ordered from general to specific, like &quot;lovely intelligent person&quot; or &quot;old medieval castle&quot;.

This order may be more rigid in some languages than others; in some, like Spanish, it may only be a default (&quot;unmarked&quot;) word order, with other orders being permissible. Other languages, such as Tagalog, follow their adjectival orders as rigidly as English.

The normal adjectival order of English may be overridden in certain circumstances, especially when one adjective is being fronted or with ablaut reduplication. For example, the usual order of adjectives in English would result in the phrase &quot;the bad big wolf&quot; (opinion before size), but instead, the usual phrase is &quot;the big bad wolf&quot;.

Owing partially to borrowings from French, English has some adjectives that follow the noun as postmodifiers, called postpositive adjectives, as in &quot;time immemorial&quot; and &quot;attorney general&quot;. Adjectives may even change meaning depending on whether they precede or follow, as in &quot;proper&quot;: &quot;They live in a &quot;proper town&quot;&quot; (a real town, not a village) vs. &quot;They live in the &quot;town proper&quot; (in the town itself, not in the suburbs). All adjectives can follow objects or subjects in elliptical constructions, such as &quot;tell me &quot;something&quot; [that is] &quot;new&quot;&quot; or &quot;We ate the &quot;pizza&quot; [that was] &quot;cold&quot;.&quot;

==Comparison (degrees)==
In many languages, some adjectives are &quot;comparable&quot; and the measure of comparison is called &quot;degree&quot;. For example, a person may be &quot;polite&quot;, but another person may be &quot;&quot;more&quot; polite&quot;, and a third person may be the &quot;&quot;most&quot; polite&quot; of the three. The word &quot;more&quot; here modifies the adjective &quot;polite&quot; to indicate a comparison is being made, and &quot;most&quot; modifies the adjective to indicate an absolute comparison (a &quot;superlative&quot;).

Among languages that allow adjectives to be compared, different means are used to indicate comparison. Some languages do not distinguish between comparative and superlative forms. Other languages allow adjectives to be compared but do not have a special comparative form of the adjective. In such cases, as in some Australian Aboriginal languages, case-marking, such as the ablative case, may be used to indicate one entity has more of an adjectival quality than (i.e. &quot;from&quot;—hence ABL) another.

In English, many adjectives can be inflected to comparative and superlative forms by taking the suffixes &quot;-er&quot; and &quot;-est&quot; (sometimes requiring additional letters before the suffix; see forms for &quot;far&quot; below), respectively:

: &quot;great&quot;, &quot;greater&quot;, &quot;greatest&quot;
: &quot;deep&quot;, &quot;deeper&quot;, &quot;deepest&quot;

Some adjectives are &quot;irregular&quot; in this sense:
: &quot;good&quot;, &quot;better&quot;, &quot;best&quot;
: &quot;bad&quot;, &quot;worse&quot;, &quot;worst&quot;
: &quot;many&quot;, &quot;more&quot;, &quot;most&quot; (sometimes regarded as an adverb or determiner)
: &quot;little&quot;, &quot;less&quot;, &quot;least&quot;

Some adjectives can have both &quot;regular&quot; and &quot;irregular&quot; variations:
: &quot;old&quot;, &quot;older&quot;, &quot;oldest&quot;
: &quot;far&quot;, &quot;farther&quot;, &quot;farthest&quot;

also
: &quot;old&quot;, &quot;elder&quot;, &quot;eldest&quot;
: &quot;far&quot;, &quot;further&quot;, &quot;furthest&quot;

Another way to convey comparison is by incorporating the words &quot;more&quot; and &quot;most&quot;. There is no simple rule to decide which means is correct for any given adjective, however. The general tendency is for simpler adjectives and those from Anglo-Saxon to take the suffixes, while longer adjectives and those from French, Latin, or Greek do not—but sometimes the &quot;sound&quot; of the word is the deciding factor.

Many adjectives do not naturally lend themselves to comparison. For example, some English speakers would argue that it does not make sense to say that one thing is &quot;more ultimate&quot; than another, or that something is &quot;most ultimate&quot;, since the word &quot;ultimate&quot; is already absolute in its semantics. Such adjectives are called &quot;non-comparable&quot; or &quot;absolute&quot;. Nevertheless, native speakers will frequently play with the raised forms of adjectives of this sort. Although &quot;pregnant&quot; is logically non-comparable (either one is pregnant or not), one may hear a sentence like &quot;She looks more and more pregnant each day&quot;.

Comparative and superlative forms are also occasionally used for other purposes than comparison. In English comparatives can be used to suggest that a statement is only tentative or tendential: one might say &quot;John is more the shy-and-retiring type&quot;, where the comparative &quot;more&quot; is not really comparing him with other people or with other impressions of him, but rather, could be substituting for &quot;on the whole&quot; or &quot;more so than not&quot;. In Italian, superlatives are frequently used to put strong emphasis on an adjective: means &quot;most beautiful&quot;, but is in fact more commonly heard in the sense &quot;extremely beautiful&quot;.

==Restrictiveness==
Attributive adjectives and other noun modifiers may be used either &quot;restrictively&quot; (helping to identify the noun&#x27;s referent, hence &quot;restricting&quot; its reference) or &quot;non-restrictively&quot; (helping to describe a noun). For example:

:&quot;He was a lazy sort, who would avoid a &quot;difficult task&quot; and fill his working hours with easy ones.&quot;
Here &quot;difficult&quot; is restrictive – it tells which tasks he avoids, distinguishing these from the easy ones: &quot;Only those tasks that are difficult&quot;.
:&quot;She had the job of sorting out the mess left by her predecessor, and she performed this &quot;difficult task&quot; with great acumen.&quot;
Here &quot;difficult&quot; is non-restrictive – it is already known which task it was, but the adjective describes it more fully: &quot;The aforementioned task, which (by the way) is difficult.&quot;

In some languages, such as Spanish, restrictiveness is consistently marked; for example, in Spanish means &quot;the difficult task&quot; in the sense of &quot;the task that is difficult&quot; (restrictive), whereas means &quot;the difficult task&quot; in the sense of &quot;the task, which is difficult&quot; (non-restrictive). In English, restrictiveness is not marked on adjectives but is marked on relative clauses (the difference between &quot;the man &quot;who recognized me&quot; was there&quot; and &quot;the man, &quot;who recognized me&quot;, was there&quot; being one of restrictiveness).

==Agreement==
In some languages, adjectives alter their form to reflect the gender, case and number of the noun that they describe. This is called agreement or concord. Usually it takes the form of inflections at the end of the word, as in Latin:

In Celtic languages, however, initial consonant lenition marks the adjective with a feminine singular noun, as in Irish:

Here, a distinction may be made between attributive and predicative usage. In English, adjectives never agree, whereas in French, they always agree. In German, they agree only when they are used attributively, and in Hungarian, they agree only when they are used predicatively:

==Semantics==
Semanticist Barbara Partee classifies adjectives semantically as intersective, subsective, or nonsubsective, with nonsubsective adjectives being plain nonsubsective or privative.

* An adjective is intersective if and only if the extension of its combination with a noun is equal to the intersection of its extension and that of the noun its modifying. For example, the adjective &quot;carnivorous&quot; is intersective, given the extension of &quot;carnivorous mammal&quot; is the intersection of the extensions of &quot;carnivorous&quot; and &quot;mammal&quot; (i.e., the set of all mammals who are carnivorous).
* An adjective is subsective if and only if the extension of its combination with a noun is a subset of the extension of the noun. For example, the extension of &quot;skillful surgeon&quot; is a subset of the extension of &quot;surgeon&quot;, but it is not the intersection of that and the extension of &quot;skillful&quot;, as that would include (for example) incompetent surgeons who are skilled violinists. All intersective adjectives are subsective, but the term &#x27;subsective&#x27; is sometimes used to refer to only those subsective adjectives which are not intersective.
* An adjective is privative if and only if the extension of its combination with a noun is disjoint from the extension of the noun. For example, &quot;fake&quot; is privative because a fake cat is not a cat.
* A plain nonsubsective adjective is an adjective that is not subsective or privative. For example, the word &quot;possible&quot; is this kind of adjective, as the extension of &quot;possible murderer&quot; overlaps with, but is not included in the extension of &quot;murderer&quot; (as some, but not all, possible murderers are murderers).

<text>An adverb is a word or an expression that generally modifies a verb, an adjective, another adverb, a determiner, a clause, a preposition, or a sentence. Adverbs typically express manner, place, time, frequency, degree, or level of certainty by answering questions such as &quot;how&quot;, &quot;in what way&quot;, &quot;when&quot;, &quot;where&quot;, &quot;to what extent&quot;. This is called the adverbial function and may be performed by an individual adverb, by an adverbial phrase, or by an adverbial clause.

Adverbs are traditionally regarded as one of the parts of speech. Modern linguists note that the term &quot;adverb&quot; has come to be used as a kind of &quot;catch-all&quot; category, used to classify words with various types of syntactic behavior, not necessarily having much in common except that they do not fit into any of the other available categories (noun, adjective, preposition, etc.).

==Functions==
The English word &quot;adverb&quot; derives (through French) from Latin &quot;adverbium&quot;, from &quot;ad-&quot; (&#x27;to&#x27;), &quot;verbum&quot; (&#x27;word&#x27;, &#x27;verb&#x27;), and the nominal suffix &quot;-ium&quot;. The term implies that the principal function of adverbs is to act as modifiers of verbs or verb phrases. An adverb used in this way may provide information about the manner, place, time, frequency, certainty, or other circumstances of the activity denoted by the verb or verb phrase. Some examples:
*She sang loudly (&quot;loudly&quot; modifies the verb &quot;sang&quot;, indicating the manner of singing)
*We left it here (&quot;here&quot; modifies the verb phrase &quot;left it&quot;, indicating place)
*I worked yesterday (&quot;yesterday&quot; modifies the verb &quot;worked&quot;, indicating time)
*You often make mistakes (&quot;often&quot; modifies the verb phrase &quot;make mistakes&quot;, indicating frequency)
*He undoubtedly did it (&quot;undoubtedly&quot; modifies the verb phrase &quot;did it&quot;, indicating certainty)

Adverbs can also be used as modifiers of adjectives, and of other adverbs, often to indicate degree. Examples:
* You are quite right (the adverb &quot;quite&quot; modifies the adjective &quot;right&quot;)
* She sang very loudly (the adverb &quot;very&quot; modifies another adverb – &quot;loudly&quot;)

They can also modify determiners, prepositional phrases, or whole clauses or sentences, as in the following examples:
* I bought practically the only fruit (&quot;practically&quot; modifies the determiner &quot;the &quot; in the noun phrase, &quot;the only fruit&quot; wherein &quot;only&quot; is an adjective)
* She drove us almost to the station (&quot;almost&quot; modifies the prepositional phrase &quot;to the station&quot;)
* Certainly we need to act (&quot;certainly&quot; modifies the sentence as a whole)
Adverbs thus perform a wide range of modifying functions. The major exception is the function of modifier of nouns, which is performed instead by adjectives (compare &quot;she sang loudly&quot; with &quot;her loud singing disturbed me&quot;; here the verb &quot;sang&quot; is modified by the adverb &quot;loudly&quot;, whereas the noun &quot;singing&quot; is modified by the adjective &quot;loud&quot;). However, because some adverbs and adjectives are homonyms, their respective functions are sometimes conflated:
*Even numbers are divisible by two
*The camel even drank.
The word &quot;even&quot; in the first sentence is an adjective, since it is a prepositive modifier that modifies the noun &quot;numbers&quot;. The word &quot;even&quot; in the second sentence is a prepositive adverb that modifies the verb &quot;drank.&quot;

Although it is possible for an adverb to precede or to follow a noun or a noun phrase, the adverb nonetheless does &quot;not&quot; modify either in such cases, as in:
*Internationally there is a shortage of protein for animal feeds
*There is a shortage internationally of protein for animal feeds
*There is an international shortage of protein for animal feeds
In the first sentence, &quot;Internationally&quot; is a prepositive adverb that modifies the clause, &quot;there is ...&quot; In the second sentence, &quot;internationally&quot; is a postpositive adverb that modifies the clause, &quot;There is ...&quot; By contrast, the third sentence contains &quot;international&quot; as a prepositive adjective that modifies the noun, &quot;shortage.&quot; 

Adverbs can sometimes be used as predicative expressions; in English, this applies especially to adverbs of location:
*Your seat is there.
*Here is my boarding pass (wherein &quot;boarding pass&quot; is the subject and &quot;here&quot; is the predicate in a syntax that entails a subject-verb inversion).

When the function of an adverb is performed by an expression consisting of more than one word, it is called an adverbial phrase or adverbial clause, or simply an adverbial.

==Formation and comparison==
In English, adverbs of manner (answering the question &quot;how?&quot;) are often formed by adding &quot;-ly&quot; to adjectives, but flat adverbs (such as in &quot;drive fast&quot;, &quot;drive slow&quot;, and &quot;drive friendly&quot;) have the same form as the corresponding adjective. Other languages often have similar methods for deriving adverbs from adjectives (French, for example, uses the suffix &quot;-ment&quot;), or else use the same form for both adjectives and adverbs, as in German and Dutch, where for example &quot;schnell&quot; or &quot;snel&quot;, respectively, mean either &quot;quick&quot; or &quot;quickly&quot; depending on the context. Many other adverbs, however, are not related to adjectives in this way; they may be derived from other words or phrases, or may be single morphemes. Examples of such adverbs in English include &quot;here, there, together, yesterday, aboard, very, almost&quot;, etc.

Where the meaning permits, adverbs may undergo comparison, taking comparative and superlative forms. In English this is usually done by adding &quot;more&quot; and &quot;most&quot; before the adverb (&quot;more slowly, most slowly&quot;), although there are a few adverbs that take inflected forms, such as &quot;well&quot;, for which &quot;better&quot; and &quot;best&quot; are used.

For more information about the formation and use of adverbs in English, see English adverbs. For other languages, see below, and the articles on individual languages and their grammars.

==As a &quot;catch-all&quot; category==
Adverbs are considered a part of speech in traditional English grammar, and are still included as a part of speech in grammar taught in schools and used in dictionaries. However, modern grammarians recognize that words traditionally grouped together as adverbs serve a number of different functions. Some describe adverbs as a &quot;catch-all&quot; category that includes all words that do not belong to one of the other parts of speech.

A logical approach to dividing words into classes relies on recognizing which words can be used in a certain context. For example, the only type of word that can be inserted in the following template to form a grammatical sentence is a noun:
:The _____ is red. (For example, &quot;The hat is red&quot;.)
When this approach is taken, it is seen that adverbs fall into a number of different categories. For example, some adverbs can be used to modify an entire sentence, whereas others cannot. Even when a sentential adverb has other functions, the meaning is often not the same. For example, in the sentences &quot;She gave birth naturally&quot; and &quot;Naturally, she gave birth&quot;, the word &quot;naturally&quot; has different meanings: in the first sentence, as a verb-modifying adverb, it means &quot;in a natural manner&quot;, while in the second sentence, as a sentential adverb, it means something like &quot;of course&quot;.

Words like &quot;very&quot; afford another example. We can say &quot;Perry is very fast&quot;, but not &quot;Perry very won the race&quot;. These words can modify adjectives but not verbs. On the other hand, there are words like &quot;here&quot; and &quot;there&quot; that cannot modify adjectives. We can say &quot;The sock looks good there&quot; but not &quot;It is a there beautiful sock&quot;. The fact that many adverbs can be used in more than one of these functions can confuse the issue, and it may seem like splitting hairs to say that a single adverb is really two or more words that serve different functions. However, this distinction can be useful, especially when considering adverbs like &quot;naturally&quot; that have different meanings in their different functions. Rodney Huddleston distinguishes between a &quot;word&quot; and a &quot;lexicogrammatical-word&quot;.

Grammarians find difficulty categorizing negating words, such as the English &quot;not&quot;. Although traditionally listed as an adverb, this word does not behave grammatically like any other, and it probably should be placed in a class of its own.

==In other languages==
* In Dutch adverbs have the basic form of their corresponding adjectives and are not inflected (though they sometimes can be compared).
* In German the term &quot;Adverb&quot; is defined differently from its use in the English language. German adverbs form a group of uninflectable words (though a few can be compared). An English &quot;adverb&quot; which is derived from an adjective is arranged in German under the adjectives with &quot;adverbial use&quot; in the sentence. The others are also called adverbs in the German language.
* In Scandinavian languages, adverbs are typically derived from adjectives by adding the suffix &#x27;-t&#x27;, which makes it identical to the adjective&#x27;s neuter form. Scandinavian adjectives, like English ones, are inflected in terms of comparison by adding &#x27;-ere&#x27;/&#x27;-are&#x27; (comparative) or &#x27;-est&#x27;/&#x27;-ast&#x27; (superlative). In inflected forms of adjectives, the &#x27;-t&#x27; is absent. Periphrastic comparison is also possible.
* In most Romance languages, many adverbs are formed from adjectives (often the feminine form) by adding &#x27;-mente&#x27; (Portuguese, Spanish, Galician, Italian) or &#x27;-ment&#x27; (French, Catalan) (from Latin &quot;mens, mentis&quot;: mind, intelligence, or suffix &quot;-mentum&quot;, result or way of action), while other adverbs are single forms which are invariable. In Romanian, almost all adverbs are simply the masculine singular form of the corresponding adjective, one notable exception being &quot;bine&quot; (&quot;well&quot;) / &quot;bun&quot; (&quot;good&quot;). However, there are some Romanian adverbs built from certain masculine singular nouns using the suffix &quot;-ește&quot;, such as the following ones: &quot;băieț-ește&quot; (boyishly), &quot;tiner-ește&quot; (youthfully), &quot;bărbăt-ește&quot; (manly), &quot;frăț-ește&quot; (brotherly), etc.
* Interlingua also forms adverbs by adding &#x27;-mente&#x27; to the adjective. If an adjective ends in &quot;c&quot;, the adverbial ending is &#x27;-amente&#x27;. A few short, invariable adverbs, such as &quot;ben&quot; (&quot;well&quot;), and &quot;mal&quot; (&quot;badly&quot;), are available and widely used.
* In Esperanto, adverbs are not formed from adjectives but are made by adding &#x27;-e&#x27; directly to the word root. Thus, from &quot;bon&quot; are derived &quot;bone&quot;, &quot;well&quot;, and &quot;bona&quot;, &quot;good&quot;. See also: special Esperanto adverbs.
* In Hungarian adverbs are formed from adjectives of any degree through the suffixes &quot;-ul/ül&quot; and &quot;-an/en&quot; depending on the adjective: &quot;szép&quot; (beautiful) → &quot;szépen&quot; (beautifully) or the comparative &quot;szebb&quot; (more beautiful) → &quot;szebben&quot; (more beautifully)
* Modern Standard Arabic forms adverbs by adding the indefinite accusative ending &#x27;-an&#x27; to the root: &quot;kathiir-&quot;, &quot;many&quot;, becomes &quot;kathiiran&quot; &quot;much&quot;. However, Arabic often avoids adverbs by using a cognate accusative followed by an adjective.
* Austronesian languages generally form comparative adverbs by repeating the root (as in WikiWiki) as with the plural noun.
* Japanese forms adverbs from verbal adjectives by adding /ku/ (く) to the stem (haya- &quot;swift&quot; hayai &quot;quick/early&quot;, hayakatta &quot;was quick&quot;, hayaku &quot;quickly&quot;) and from nominal adjectives by placing /ni/ (に) after the adjective instead of the copula /na/ (な) or /no/ (の) (rippa &quot;splendid&quot;, rippa ni &quot;splendidly&quot;). The derivations are quite productive, but for a few adjectives, adverbs may not be derived.
* In the Celtic languages, an adverbial form is often made by preceding the adjective with a preposition: &quot;go&quot; in Irish or &quot;gu&quot; in Scottish Gaelic, meaning &#x27;until&#x27;. In Cornish, &quot;yn&quot; is used, meaning &#x27;in&#x27;.
* In Modern Greek, an adverb is most commonly made by adding the endings &lt;-α&gt; or &lt;-ως&gt; to the root of an adjective. Often, the adverbs formed from a common root using each of these endings have slightly different meanings. So, &lt;τέλειος&gt; (&lt;téleios&gt;, meaning &quot;perfect&quot; and &quot;complete&quot;) yields &lt;τέλεια&gt; (&lt;téleia&gt;, &quot;perfectly&quot;) and &lt;τελείως&gt; (&lt;teleíos&gt;, &quot;completely&quot;). Not all adjectives can be transformed into adverbs by using both endings. &lt;Γρήγορος&gt; (&lt;grígoros&gt;, &quot;swift&quot;) becomes &lt;γρήγορα&gt; (&lt;grígora&gt;, &quot;swiftly&quot;), but not normally *&lt;γρηγόρως&gt; (*&lt;grigóros&gt;). When the &lt;-ως&gt; ending is used to transform an adjective whose stress accent is on the third syllable from the end, such as &lt;επίσημος&gt; (&lt;epísimos&gt;, &quot;official&quot;), the corresponding adverb is accented on the second syllable from the end; compare &lt;επίσημα&gt; (&lt;epísima&gt;) and &lt;επισήμως&gt; (&lt;episímos&gt;), which both mean &quot;officially&quot;. There are also other endings with particular and restricted use as &lt;-ί&gt;, &lt;-εί&gt;, &lt;-ιστί&gt;, etc. For example, &lt;ατιμωρητί&gt; (&lt;atimorití&gt;, &quot;with impunity&quot;) and &lt;ασυζητητί&gt; (&lt;asyzitití&gt;, &quot;indisputably&quot;); &lt;αυτολεξεί&gt; (&lt;aftolexí&gt; &quot;word for word&quot;) and &lt;αυτοστιγμεί&gt; (&lt;aftostigmí&gt;, &quot;in no time&quot;); &lt;αγγλιστί&gt; [&lt;anglistí&gt; &quot;in English (language)&quot;] and &lt;παπαγαλιστί&gt; (&lt;papagalistí&gt;, &quot;by rote&quot;); etc.
* In Latvian, an adverb is formed from an adjective by changing the masculine or feminine adjective endings -s and -a to -i. &quot;Labs&quot;, meaning &quot;good&quot;, becomes &quot;labi&quot; for &quot;well&quot;. Latvian adverbs have a particular use in expressions meaning &quot;to speak&quot; or &quot;to understand&quot; a language. Rather than use the noun meaning &quot;Latvian/English/Russian&quot;, the adverb formed from these words is used. &quot;Es runāju latviski/angliski/krieviski&quot; means &quot;I speak Latvian/English/Russian&quot; or, literally, &quot;I speak Latvianly/Englishly/Russianly&quot;. If a noun is required, the expression used means literally &quot;language of the Latvians/English/Russians&quot;, &quot;latviešu/angļu/krievu valoda&quot;.
*In Russian, and analogously in Ukrainian and some other Slavic languages, most adverbs are formed by removing the adjectival suffixes &quot;-ий&quot; &quot;-а&quot; or &quot;-е&quot; from an adjective, and replacing them with the adverbial &quot;-о&quot;. For example, in Ukrainian, &quot;швидкий&quot;, &quot;гарна&quot;, and &quot;смачне&quot; (fast, nice, tasty) become &quot;швидко&quot;, &quot;гарно&quot;, and &quot;смачно&quot; (quickly, nicely, tastily), while in Russian, &quot;быстрый&quot;, &quot;хороший&quot; and &quot;прекрасный&quot; (quick, good, wonderful) become &quot;быстро&quot;, &quot;хорошо&quot;, &quot;прекрасно&quot; (quickly, well, wonderfully). Another wide group of adverbs are formed by gluing a preposition to an oblique case form. In Ukrainian, for example, (до &quot;onto&quot;) + (долу &quot;bottom&quot;) → (додолу &quot;downwards&quot;); (з &quot;off&quot;) + (далеку &quot;afar&quot;) → (здалеку &quot;afar-off&quot;) . As well, adverbs are mostly placed before the verbs they modify: &quot;Добрий син гарно співає.&quot; (A good son sings nicely/well). There is no specific word order in East Slavic languages.
* In Korean, adverbs are commonly formed by replacing the -다 ending of the dictionary form of a descriptive verb with 게. So, 쉽다 (easy) becomes 쉽게 (easily). They are also formed by replacing the 하다 of some compound verbs with 히, e.g. 안녕하다 (peaceful) &gt; 안녕히 (peacefully).
* In Turkish, the same word usually serves as adjective and adverb: &quot;iyi bir kız&quot; (&quot;a good girl&quot;), &quot;iyi anlamak&quot; (&quot;to understand well&quot;).
* In Chinese, adverbs are not a separate class. Adjectives become adverbs when they are marked by an adverbial suffix, for example 地 de（e.g., 孩子們快樂地唱歌 haizimen kuaile.de changge &#x27;the children happily sing a song&#x27;), or when adjectives are preceded by a verbal suffix such as 得 de (e.g., 她說漢語說得很好 ta shuo hanyu shuo.de henhao &#x27;she speaks Chinese very well&#x27;). 
* In Persian, many adjectives and adverbs have the same form such as &quot;خوب&quot;, &quot;سریع&quot;, &quot;تند&quot; so there is no obvious way to recognise them out of context. The only exceptions are Arabic adverbs with a &quot;اً&quot; suffix such as &quot;ظاهراً&quot; and &quot;واقعاً&quot;.

<text>Depleted uranium (DU), also referred to in the past as Q-metal, depletalloy, or D-38, is uranium with a lower content of the fissile isotope 235U than natural uranium. The less radioactive and non-fissile 238U is the main component of depleted uranium.

Uranium is notable for the extremely high density of its metallic form: at , uranium is more dense than lead. Depleted uranium, which has about the same density as natural uranium, is used when this high density is desirable but the higher radioactivity of natural uranium is not. Civilian uses include counterweights in aircraft, radiation shielding in medical radiation therapy, research and industrial radiography equipment, and containers for transporting radioactive materials. Military uses include armor plating and armor-piercing projectiles.

The use of DU in munitions is controversial because of concerns about potential long-term health effects. Normal functioning of the kidney, brain, liver, heart, and numerous other systems can be affected by exposure to uranium, a toxic metal. It is only weakly radioactive because of the long radioactive half-life of 238U (4.468 × 109 or 4,468,000,000 years) and the low amounts of 234U (half-life about 246,000 years) and 235U (half-life 700 million years). The biological half-life (the average time it takes for the human body to eliminate half the amount in the body) for uranium is about 15 days. The aerosol or spallation frangible powder produced by impact and combustion of depleted uranium munitions (or armour) can potentially contaminate wide areas around the impact sites, leading to possible inhalation by human beings.

The actual level of acute and chronic toxicity of DU is also controversial. Several studies using cultured cells and laboratory rodents suggest the possibility of leukemogenic, genetic, reproductive, and neurological effects from chronic exposure. According to an article in Al Jazeera, DU from American artillery is suspected to be one of the major causes of an increase in the general mortality rate in Iraq since 1991. A 2005 epidemiology review concluded &quot;In aggregate the human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in offspring of persons exposed to DU.&quot; A 2021 study concluded that DU from exploding munitions did not lead to Gulf War illness in American veterans deployed in the Gulf War. According to a 2013 study, despite the use of DU by coalition forces in Fallujah, Iraq, no DU has been found in soil samples taken from the city, although another study of 2011 had indicated elevated levels of uranium in tissues of the city inhabitants.

==Definition==
Natural uranium contains about 235U. Depleted uranium has lower mass fractions—up to three times less—of 235U and 234U than natural uranium. Since 238U has a much longer half-life than the lighter isotopes, DU is about 40% less radioactive than natural uranium. Most of the alpha radiation comes from 238U and 234U whereas beta radiation comes from decay products 234Th and 234Pa that are formed within a few weeks.

The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) defines &quot;depleted uranium&quot; as uranium with a percentage of the 235U isotope that is less than by weight (see 10 CFR 40.4). The military specifications designate that the DU used by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) contain less than 235U. In actuality, DoD uses only DU that contains approximately 235U.

==History==
Enriched uranium was first manufactured in the early 1940s when the United States and Great Britain began their nuclear weapons programs. Later in the decade, France and the Soviet Union began their nuclear weapons and nuclear power programs. Depleted uranium was originally stored as an unusable waste product (uranium hexafluoride) in the hope that improved enrichment processes could extract additional quantities of the fissionable 235U isotope. This re-enrichment recovery of the residual uranium-235 is now in practice in some parts of the world; e.g. in 1996 over 6000 metric tonnes were upgraded in a Russian plant.

In the 1970s, the Pentagon reported that the Soviet military had developed armor plating for Warsaw Pact tanks that NATO ammunition could not penetrate. The Pentagon began searching for material to make denser armor-piercing projectiles. After testing various metals, ordnance researchers settled on depleted uranium.

The US and NATO militaries used DU penetrator rounds in the 1991 Gulf War, the Bosnia war, bombing of Serbia, the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and 2015 airstrikes on ISIS in Syria. It is estimated that between 315 and 350 tons of DU were used in the 1991 Gulf War.

==Production==
Most depleted uranium arises as a by-product of the production of enriched uranium for use as fuel in nuclear reactors and in the manufacture of nuclear weapons. Enrichment processes generate uranium with a higher-than-natural concentration of lower-mass-number uranium isotopes (in particular 235U, which is the uranium isotope supporting the fission chain reaction) with the bulk of the feed ending up as depleted uranium.

Natural uranium metal contains about 235U, 238U, and about 234U. The production of enriched uranium using isotope separation creates &quot;depleted uranium&quot; containing only 0.2% to 0.4% 235U. Because natural uranium begins with such a low percentage of 235U, enrichment produces large quantities of depleted uranium. For example, producing of enriched uranium requires of natural uranium, and leaves about of depleted uranium having only 235U.

Depleted uranium is further produced by recycling spent nuclear fuel, in which case it contains traces of neptunium and plutonium. These quantities are so small that they are not considered to be of serious radiological significance by the European Committee on Radiation Risk. DU from nuclear reprocessing has different isotopic ratios from enrichment-by-product DU, from which it can be distinguished by the presence of 236U.

The only known natural source of uranium with a content significantly different from 0.71% is found in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, Gabon. It can be &quot;fingerprinted&quot; as different in origin from manmade depleted uranium by the content, which is 55 ppm in uranium from the Oklo Mine as well as all other natural sources, but will be lower in depleted uranium in accordance with the degree of depletion.

==Storage==


About 95% of the depleted uranium produced until now is stored as uranium hexafluoride, or (D), in steel cylinders in open air storage yards close to enrichment plants. Each cylinder typically holds up to of . In the U.S. of depleted had accumulated by 1993. In 2008, in 57,122 storage cylinders were located near Portsmouth, Ohio; Oak Ridge, Tennessee; and Paducah, Kentucky.

The storage of (D) presents environmental, health, and safety risks because of its chemical instability. When is exposed to water vapor in the air, it reacts with the moisture to produce (uranyl fluoride), a solid, and (hydrogen fluoride), a gas, both of which are highly soluble and toxic. The uranyl fluoride solid acts to plug the leak, limiting further escape of depleted . Release of the hydrogen fluoride gas to the atmosphere is also slowed by the plug formation. Like any other uranium compound, it is radioactive, and precautions should be taken. It is also highly toxic. Whether ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin, uranyl fluoride is corrosive and may harm internal organs, potentially resulting in death. Effects of exposure may be delayed.

The U.S. government has been converting depleted to solid uranium oxides for use or disposal. Such disposal of the entire D inventory could cost anywhere from million to million.

The vulnerability of DUF6 storage cylinders to terrorist attack is also a matter of concern.


==Military applications==
Depleted uranium is very dense; at 19,050 kg/m3, it is 1.67 times as dense as lead, only slightly less dense than tungsten and gold, and only 16% less than osmium or iridium, which are the densest known substances under standard (i.e., Earth-surface) pressures. Consequently, a DU projectile of given mass has a smaller diameter than an equivalent lead projectile with the same kinetic energy, with less aerodynamic drag and deeper penetration because of a higher pressure at point of impact. DU projectiles are inherently incendiary because they become pyrophoric upon impact with the target.

===Armor plate===
Because of its high density, depleted uranium can also be used in tank armor, sandwiched between sheets of steel armor plate. For instance, some late-production M1A1 and M1A2 Abrams tanks built after 1998 have DU modules integrated into their Chobham armor, as part of the armor plating in the front of the turret, and there is a program to upgrade older tanks.

===Nuclear weapons===

Depleted uranium can be used as a tamper, or neutron reflector, in fission bombs. A high density tamper like DU makes for a longer-lasting, more energetic, and more efficient explosion.

===Ammunition===
Most military use of depleted uranium has been as 30 mm ordnance, primarily the 30 mm PGU-14/B armor-piercing incendiary round from the GAU-8 Avenger cannon of the A-10 Thunderbolt II used by the United States Air Force. 25 mm DU rounds have been used in the M242 gun mounted on the U.S. Army&#x27;s Bradley Fighting Vehicle and the Marine Corps&#x27;s LAV-25.

The U.S. Marine Corps uses DU in the 25 mm PGU-20 round fired by the GAU-12 Equalizer cannon of the AV-8B Harrier, and also in the 20 mm M197 gun mounted on AH-1 Cobra helicopter gunships. The United States Navy&#x27;s Phalanx CIWS&#x27;s M61 Vulcan Gatling gun used 20 mm armor-piercing penetrator rounds with discarding plastic sabots and a core made using depleted uranium, later changed to tungsten.

Another use of depleted uranium is in kinetic energy penetrators, anti-armor rounds such as the 120 mm sabot rounds fired from the British Challenger 1, Challenger 2, M1A1 and M1A2 Abrams. Kinetic energy penetrator rounds consist of a long, relatively thin penetrator surrounded by a discarding sabot. Staballoys are metal alloys of depleted uranium with a very small proportion of other metals, usually titanium or molybdenum. One formulation has a composition of 99.25% by mass of depleted uranium and 0.75% by mass of titanium. Staballoys are approximately 1.67 times as dense as lead and are designed for use in kinetic energy penetrator armor-piercing ammunition. The US Army uses DU in an alloy with around 3.5% titanium.

Depleted uranium is favored for the penetrator because it is self-sharpening and flammable. On impact with a hard target, such as an armored vehicle, the tip of the projectile will be &quot;mushroomed&quot;, while the back of the projectile is still a rigid solid, this leads to adiabatic shearing and together with the spin of the projectile results in a shedding of the mushroomed plastic phase in such a way that it forms a new sharp tip. This shedding of the mushroomed tip improves penetration properties compared to the complete dispersal that takes place with tungsten penetrators, therefore DU penetrators are 20% more effective than tungsten rounds. The impact and subsequent release of heat energy causes it to ignite when in contact with oxygen. When a DU penetrator reaches the interior of an armored vehicle, it catches fire, often igniting ammunition and fuel and possibly causing the vehicle to explode. DU is used by the U.S. Army in 120 mm or 105 mm cannons employed on the M1 Abrams tank.

The DU content in various ammunition is 180 g in 20 mm projectiles, 200 g in 25 mm ones, 280 g in 30 mm, 3.5 kg in 105 mm, and 4.5 kg in 120 mm penetrators. DU was used during the mid-1990s in the U.S. to make hand grenades, and land mines, but those applications have been discontinued, according to Alliant Techsystems. The US Navy used DU in its 20 mm Phalanx CIWS guns, but switched in the late 1990s to armor-piercing tungsten.

Only the US and the UK have acknowledged using DU weapons. The Soviet Union and Russia have used DU weaponry since the 3BM-32 Vant, designed for the 125 mm tank cannons. In 2018, TASS reported that Russia was arming some of its T-80 models with 3BM60 Svinets-2 DU rounds. 782,414 DU rounds were fired during the 1991 war in Iraq, mostly by US forces. In a three-week period of conflict in Iraq during 2003, it was estimated that between 1,000 and 2,000 tonnes of depleted uranium munitions were used. More than 300,000 DU rounds were fired during the 2003 war, the vast majority by US troops. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) estimates that between 170 and 1,700 tonnes of depleted uranium was dropped in Iraq by the US military since 2003, whereas the UK reported firing 1.9 tonnes of depleted uranium weapons in Iraq

In March 2023, the UK government confirmed it was sending DU rounds to Ukraine along with its Challenger 2 tanks with its 120mm ammunition during the Russian invasion.

===Legal status in weapons===
In 1996, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) gave an advisory opinion on the &quot;legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons&quot;. This made it clear, in paragraphs 54–56, that international law on poisonous weapons—the Second Hague Declaration of 29 July 1899, Hague Convention IV of 18 October 1907 and the Geneva Protocol of 17 June 1925—did not cover nuclear weapons, because their prime or exclusive use was not to poison or asphyxiate. This ICJ opinion was about nuclear weapons, but the sentence &quot;The terms have been understood, in the practice of States, in their ordinary sense as covering weapons whose prime, or even exclusive, effect is to poison or asphyxiate,&quot; also removes depleted uranium weaponry from coverage by the same treaties as their primary use is not to poison or asphyxiate, but to destroy materiel and kill soldiers through kinetic energy.

The Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities of the United Nations Human Rights Commission, passed two motions—the first in 1996 and the second in 1997. They listed weapons of mass destruction, or weapons with indiscriminate effect, or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering and urged all states to curb the production and the spread of such weapons. Included in the list was weaponry containing depleted uranium. The committee authorized a working paper, in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms, of the weapons.

The requested UN working paper was delivered in 2002 by Y. K. J. Yeung Sik Yuen in accordance with Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights resolution 2001/36. He argues that the use of DU in weapons, along with the other weapons listed by the Sub‑Commission, may breach one or more of the following treaties: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Charter of the United Nations, the Genocide Convention, the United Nations Convention Against Torture, the Geneva Conventions including Protocol I, the Convention on Conventional Weapons of 1980, and the Chemical Weapons Convention. Yeung Sik Yuen writes in Paragraph 133 under the title &quot;Legal compliance of weapons containing DU as a new weapon&quot;:

Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia led a committee of staff lawyers to investigate possible treaty prohibitions against the use of DU in weapons. Their findings were that:

According to the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, depleted uranium does not meet the legal definitions of nuclear, radiological, toxin, chemical, poison or incendiary weapons, as far as DU ammunition is not designed nor intended to kill or wound by its chemical or radiological effects.

===Requests for a moratorium on military use===
A number of anti-war activists specializing in international humanitarian law have questioned the legality of the continued use of depleted uranium weapons, highlighting that the effects may breach the principle of distinction (between civilians and military personnel). Some states and the International Coalition to Ban Uranium Weapons, a coalition of more than 155 non-governmental organizations, have asked for a ban on the production and military use of depleted uranium weapons.

The European Parliament has repeatedly passed resolutions requesting an immediate moratorium on the further use of depleted uranium ammunition, but France and Britain – the only European states that are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council—have consistently rejected calls for a ban, maintaining that its use continues to be legal, and that the health risks are unsubstantiated.

In 2007, France, Britain, the Netherlands, and the Czech Republic voted against a United Nations General Assembly resolution to hold a debate in 2009 about the effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium. All other European Union nations voted in favour or abstained. The ambassador from the Netherlands explained his negative vote as being due to the reference in the preamble to the resolution &quot;to potential harmful effects of the use of depleted uranium munitions on human health and the environment [which] cannot, in our view, be supported by conclusive scientific studies conducted by relevant international organizations.&quot; None of the other permanent members of the United Nations Security Council supported the resolution as China was absent for the vote, Russia abstained and the United States voted against the resolution.

In September 2008, and in response to the 2007 General Assembly resolution, the UN Secretary General published the views of 15 states alongside those of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and World Health Organization (WHO). The IAEA and WHO evidence differed little from previous statements on the issue. The report was largely split between states concerned about depleted uranium&#x27;s use, such as Finland, Cuba, Japan, Serbia, Argentina, and predominantly NATO members, who do not consider the use of depleted uranium munitions problematic.

In December 2008, 141 states supported a resolution requesting that three UN agencies: United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), WHO and IAEA update their research on the impact of uranium munitions by late 2010—to coincide with the General Assembly&#x27;s 65th Session, four voted against, 34 abstained and 13 were absent. As before Britain and France voted against the resolution. All other European Union nations voted in favour or abstained: the Netherlands, which voted against a resolution in 2007, voted in favour, as did Finland and Norway, both of which had abstained in 2007, while the Czech Republic, which voted against the resolution in 2007, abstained. The two other states that voted against the resolution were Israel and the United States (both of which voted against in 2007), while as before China was absent for the vote, and Russia abstained.

In June 2009, Belgium became the first country in the world to ban: &quot;inert ammunition and armour that contains depleted uranium or any other industrially manufactured uranium.&quot; The move followed a unanimous parliamentary vote on the issue on 22 March 2007. The text of the 2007 law allowed for two years to pass until it came into force. In April 2009, the Belgian Senate voted unanimously to restrict investments by Belgian banks into the manufacturers of depleted uranium weapons.

In September 2009, the Latin American Parliament passed a resolution calling for a regional moratorium on the use, production and procurement of uranium weapons. It also called on the Parlatino&#x27;s members to work towards an international uranium weapons treaty.

In November 2010 the Irish Senate passed a bill seeking to outlaw depleted uranium weapons, but it lapsed before approval by the Dáil.

In December 2010, 148 states supported a United Nations&#x27; General Assembly resolution calling for the states that use depleted uranium weapons in conflict to reveal where the weapons have been fired when asked to do so by the country upon whose territory they have been used.

In April 2011, the Congress of Costa Rica passed a law prohibiting uranium weapons in its territories, becoming the second country in the world to do so.

In December 2012, 155 states supported a United Nations&#x27; General Assembly resolution that recalled that, because of the ongoing uncertainties over the long-term environmental impacts of depleted uranium identified by the United Nations Environment Programme, states should adopt a precautionary approach to its use.

In December 2014, 150 states supported a United Nations&#x27; General Assembly resolution encouraging states to provide assistance to states affected by the use of depleted uranium weapons, in particular in identifying and managing contaminated sites and material. In contrast to the previous biennial resolutions, Germany moved to an abstention from supporting to the resolutions. Prior to the vote, in a report to the United Nations Secretary General requested by 2012&#x27;s resolution published in June 2014, Iraq had called for a global treaty ban on depleted uranium weapons.

==Civilian applications==
Depleted uranium has a very high density and is primarily used as shielding material for other radioactive material, and as ballast. Examples include sailboat keels, as counterweights and as shielding in industrial radiography cameras.

===Energy===
Most civilian nuclear reactors, as well as all naval reactors, require fuel containing concentrated 235U, and production of that fuel generates depleted uranium as residue. Some power-generating reactors design are able to use unenriched fuel, for example the pressurized heavy-water reactors such as the CANDU design. However as of 2013, about 10% of those built use that technology. Travelling wave reactors are a proposed type of reactor which can use depleted uranium as fuel.

===Radiation shielding===
Depleted uranium is the best radiation shielding by weight, due to the high atomic weight of the uranium atoms; materials are more able to block radioactivity the higher their atomic weight, and uranium is one of the heaviest natural elements. Lead, the heaviest stable element, is the most common low-cost alternative, but a lead shield needs to be about three times as thick as a DU shield to provide the equivalent protection. Uranium also has by far a higher melting point , and its tensile strength is similar to that of steel.

Industrial radiography cameras include a very high activity gamma radiation source (typically Ir-192 with an activity above 10 TBq). Depleted uranium is often used in the cameras as a shield to protect individuals from the gamma source. Typically, the uranium shield is supported and enclosed in polyurethane foam for thermal, mechanical and oxidation protection.

===Coloring in consumer products===
Consumer product uses have included incorporation into dental porcelain, used for false teeth to simulate the fluorescence of natural teeth, and uranium-bearing reagents used in chemistry laboratories (e.g. uranyl acetate, used in analytical chemistry and as a stain in electron microscopy). Uranium (both depleted uranium and natural uranium) was widely used as a coloring matter for porcelain and glass in the 19th and early-to-mid-20th century. The practice was largely discontinued in the late 20th century. In 1999, concentrations of 10% depleted uranium were being used in &quot;jaune no.17&quot; a yellow enamel powder that was being produced in France by Cristallerie de Saint-Paul, a manufacturer of enamel pigments. The depleted uranium used in the powder was sold by Cogéma&#x27;s Pierrelatte facility. In February 2000, Cogema discontinued the sale of depleted uranium to producers of enamel and glass.

===Trim weights in aircraft===
Aircraft that contain depleted uranium trim weights for stabilizing wings and control surfaces (such as the Boeing 747–100) may contain between of DU. This application is controversial because the DU might enter the environment if the aircraft crashes. The metal can also oxidize to a fine powder in a fire. Its use has been phased out in many newer aircraft. Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas discontinued using DU counterweights in the 1980s. Depleted uranium was released during the crash of El Al Flight 1862 on 4 October 1992, in which was lost, but a case study concluded that there was no evidence to link depleted uranium from the plane to any health problems. DU counterweights manufactured with cadmium plating are considered non-hazardous as long as the plating is intact.

===US NRC general license===
US Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations at 10 CFR 40.25 establish a general license for the use of depleted uranium contained in industrial products or devices for mass-volume applications. This general license allows anyone to possess or use depleted uranium for authorized purposes. Generally, a registration form is required, along with a commitment to not abandon the material. Agreement states may have similar, or more stringent, regulations.

===Sailboat keel===
&quot;Pen Duick VI&quot;, a boat designed by and used for racing, was equipped with a keel of depleted uranium. The benefit is that, because of the very high density of uranium, the keel could be thinner for a given weight, and so have less resistance than a normal keel. It was later replaced by a standard lead keel.

===Sampling calorimeters for detectors in high-energy particle physics===
Depleted uranium has been used in a number of sampling calorimeters (such as in the D0 and ZEUS detectors) because of its high density and natural radioactivity.

==Health considerations==
Normal functioning of the kidney, brain, liver, heart, and numerous other systems can be affected by uranium exposure because uranium is a toxic metal, although less toxic than other heavy metals, such as arsenic and mercury. It is weakly radioactive and is &#x27;persistently&#x27; so because of its very long half-life. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry states that: &quot;to be exposed to radiation from uranium, you have to eat, drink, or breathe it, or get it on your skin.&quot; If DU particles do enter an individual, the type of danger presented—toxic vs. radiological—and the organ most likely to be affected depend on the solubility of the particles.

In military conflicts involving DU munitions, the major concern is inhalation of DU particles in aerosols arising from the impacts of DU-enhanced projectiles with their targets. When depleted uranium munitions penetrate armor or burn, they create depleted uranium oxides in the form of dust that can be inhaled or contaminate wounds. The Institute of Nuclear Technology-Radiation Protection of Attiki, Greece, has noted that &quot;the aerosol produced during impact and combustion of depleted uranium munitions can potentially contaminate wide areas around the impact sites or can be inhaled by civilians and military personnel&quot;. The use of DU in incendiary ammunition is controversial because of potential adverse health effects and its release into the environment.

The U.S. Department of Defense claims that no human cancer of any type has been seen as a result of exposure to either natural or depleted uranium. Militaries have long had risk-reduction procedures for their troops to follow, and studies are in consistent agreement that veterans who used DU-enhanced munitions have not suffered, so far, from an increased risk of cancer (see the Gulf War and Balkans sections below). The effects of DU on civilian populations are, however, a topic of intense and ongoing controversy.

As early as 1997, British Army doctors warned the Ministry of Defence that exposure to depleted uranium increased the risk of developing lung, lymph and brain cancer, and recommended a series of safety precautions. According to a report issued summarizing the advice of the doctors, &quot;Inhalation of insoluble uranium dioxide dust will lead to accumulation in the lungs with very slow clearance—if any. ... Although chemical toxicity is low, there may be localised radiation damage of the lung leading to cancer.&quot; The report warns that &quot;All personnel ... should be aware that uranium dust inhalation carries a long-term risk ... [the dust] has been shown to increase the risks of developing lung, lymph and brain cancers.&quot;

In 2003, the Royal Society called, again, for urgent attention to be paid to the possible health and environmental impact of depleted uranium, and added its backing to the United Nations Environment Programme&#x27;s call for a scientific assessment of sites struck with depleted uranium. In early 2004, the UK Pensions Appeal Tribunal Service attributed birth defect claims from a February 1991 Gulf War combat veteran to depleted uranium poisoning. A 2005 epidemiology review concluded: &quot;In aggregate the human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in offspring of persons exposed to DU.&quot; Studies using cultured cells and laboratory rodents continue to suggest the possibility of leukemogenic, genetic, reproductive, and neurological effects from chronic exposure.

===Chemical toxicity===
The chemical toxicity of depleted uranium is identical to that of natural uranium and about a million times greater &quot;in vivo&quot; than DU&#x27;s radiological hazard, with the kidney considered to be the main target organ. Health effects of DU are determined by factors such as the extent of exposure and whether it was internal or external. Three main pathways exist by which internalization of uranium may occur: inhalation, ingestion, and embedded fragments or shrapnel contamination. Properties such as phase (e.g. particulate or gaseous), oxidation state (e.g. metallic or ceramic), and the solubility of uranium and its compounds influence their absorption, distribution, translocation, elimination and the resulting toxicity. For example, metallic uranium is less toxic compared to hexavalent uranium(VI) uranyl compounds such as uranium trioxide ().

Uranium is pyrophoric when finely divided. It will corrode under the influence of air and water producing insoluble uranium(IV) and soluble uranium(VI) salts. Soluble uranium salts are toxic. Uranium slowly accumulates in several organs, such as the liver, spleen, and kidneys. The World Health Organization has established a daily &quot;tolerated intake&quot; of soluble uranium salts for the general public of body weight, or for a adult.

Epidemiological studies and toxicological tests on laboratory animals point to it as being immunotoxic, teratogenic, neurotoxic, with carcinogenic and leukemogenic potential. A 2005 report by epidemiologists concluded: &quot;the human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in offspring of persons exposed to DU.&quot;

Early studies of depleted uranium aerosol exposure assumed that uranium combustion product particles would quickly settle out of the air and thus could not affect populations more than a few kilometers from target areas, and that such particles, if inhaled, would remain undissolved in the lung for a great length of time and thus could be detected in urine. Violently burning uranium droplets produce a gaseous vapor comprising about half of the uranium in their original mass. Uranyl ion contamination in uranium oxides has been detected in the residue of DU munitions fires.

Approximately of natural uranium, on average, exist in the human body as a result of normal intake of water, food and air. Most is in the skeleton. The biochemistry of depleted uranium is the same as natural uranium.

===Radiological hazards===
Available evidence suggests that the radiation risk is small relative to the chemical hazard. The primary radiation from pure depleted uranium is due to alpha particles, which do not travel far through air and do not penetrate clothing and skin. However, as uranium-238 decays into its daughter nuclei from its decay series, pure depleted uranium will generate thorium-234 (half-life of ~24 days) followed by protactinium-234 (half life of ~7 hours), which emit more penetrating beta particles at almost the same rate as the uranium emits alpha particles. Total activity then settles to a plateau as the more stable isotope uranium-234 accumulates. A quasi-steady state of roughly 3 times the initial activity is reached within months. Once an equilibrium level of uranium-234 (and its 11 shorter-lived daughter nuclei) has built up after about a million years there will be another radiation plateau at about 14 times the initial activity, finally reaching levels comparable to natural uranium.

According to the World Health Organization, radiation dose from DU would be about 60% of that from purified natural uranium with the same mass; the radiological dangers are lower due to its longer half-life and the removal of the more radioactive isotopes.

Surveying the veteran-related evidence pertaining to the Gulf War, a 2001 editorial in the &quot;BMJ&quot; concluded that it was not possible to justify claims of radiation-induced lung cancer and leukaemia in veterans of that conflict. While agreeing with the editorial&#x27;s conclusion, a reply noted that its finding in the negative was guaranteed, given that &quot;global dose estimates or results of mathematical modelling are too inaccurate to be used as dose values for an individual veteran&quot;, and that, as of April 2001, no practical method of measuring the expected small doses that each individual veteran would receive had been suggested. The author of the reply, a radiation scientist, went on to suggest a method that had been used several times before, including after the 1986 Chernobyl accident. Despite the widespread use of DU in the Iraq War, at least a year after the conflict began, testing of UK troops was still only in the discussion phase.

The Royal Society Working Group on the Health Hazards of Depleted Uranium Munitions (RSDUWG) concluded in 2002 that there were &quot;very low&quot; health risks associated with the use of depleted uranium, though it also ventured that, &quot;[i]n extreme conditions and under worst-case assumptions&quot; lung and kidney damage could occur, and that in &quot;worst-case scenarios high local levels of uranium could occur in food or water that could have adverse effects on the kidney&quot;. In 2003, the Royal Society issued another urgent call to investigate the actual health and environmental impact of depleted uranium. The same year, a cohort study of Gulf War veterans found no elevated risks of cancer generally, nor of any specific cancers in particular, though recommended follow up studies.

===Studies indicating negligible effects===
Studies in 2005 and earlier have concluded that DU ammunition has no measurable detrimental health effects.

A 1999 literature review conducted by the Rand Corporation stated: &quot;No evidence is documented in the literature of cancer or any other negative health effect related to the radiation received from exposure to depleted or natural uranium, whether inhaled or ingested, even at very high doses,&quot; and a RAND report authored by the U.S. Defense department undersecretary charged with evaluating DU hazards considered the debate to be more political than scientific.

A 2001 oncology study concluded that &quot;the present scientific consensus is that DU exposure to humans, in locations where DU ammunition was deployed, is very unlikely to give rise to cancer induction&quot;. Former NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson stated in 2001 that &quot;the existing medical consensus is clear. The hazard from depleted uranium is both very limited, and limited to very specific circumstances&quot;.

A 2002 study from the Australian defense ministry concluded that &quot;there has been no established increase in mortality or morbidity in workers exposed to uranium in uranium processing industries... studies of Gulf War veterans show that, in those who have retained fragments of depleted uranium following combat related injury, it has been possible to detect elevated urinary uranium levels, but no kidney toxicity or other adverse health effects related to depleted uranium after a decade of follow-up.&quot; Pier Roberto Danesi, then-director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Seibersdorf +Laboratory, stated in 2002 that &quot;There is a consensus now that DU does not represent a health threat&quot;.

The IAEA reported in 2003 that, &quot;based on credible scientific evidence, there is no proven link between DU exposure and increases in human cancers or other significant health or environmental impacts,&quot; although &quot;Like other heavy metals, DU is potentially poisonous. In sufficient amounts, if DU is ingested or inhaled it can be harmful because of its chemical toxicity. High concentration could cause kidney damage.&quot; The IAEA concluded that, while depleted uranium is a potential carcinogen, there is no evidence that it has been carcinogenic in humans.

A 2005 study by the U.S. Sandia National Laboratories&#x27; Al Marshall used mathematical models to analyze potential health effects associated with accidental exposure to depleted uranium during the 1991 Gulf War. Marshall&#x27;s study concluded that the reports of cancer risks from DU exposure are not supported by his analysis nor by veteran medical statistics. Marshall also examined possible genetic effects due to radiation from depleted uranium. Chemical effects, including potential reproductive issues, associated with depleted uranium exposure were discussed in some detail in a subsequent journal paper.

===Gulf War syndrome and soldier complaints===


Since 1991, the year the Gulf War ended, veterans and their families voiced concern about subsequent health problems. In 1999, an assessment of the first 1,000 veterans involved in the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s Gulf War medical assessment programme found &quot;no evidence&quot; of a single illness, physical or mental, that would explain the pattern of symptoms observed in the group. In 1999, MEDACT petitioned for the WHO to conduct an investigation into illnesses in veterans and Iraqi civilians. A major 2006 review of peer-reviewed literature by a US Institute of Medicine (IOM) committee concluded that, &quot;[b]ecause the symptoms vary greatly among individuals&quot;, they do not point to a syndrome unique to Gulf War veterans, though their report conceded that the lack of objective pre-deployment health data meant definitive conclusions were effectively impossible.

Simon Wessely praised the IOM&#x27;s review, and noted that, despite its central conclusion that no novel syndrome existed, its other findings made it &quot;equally clear that service in the Gulf war did aversely affect health in some personnel&quot;. Aside from the lack of baseline data to guide analysis of the veterans&#x27; postwar health, because no detailed health screening was carried out when the veterans entered service, another major stumbling block with some studies, like the thousand-veteran one, is that the subjects are self-selected, rather than a random sample, making general conclusions impossible.

Increased rates of immune system disorders and other wide-ranging symptoms, including chronic pain, fatigue and memory loss, have been reported in over one quarter of combat veterans of the 1991 Gulf War. Combustion products from depleted uranium munitions are being considered as one of the potential causes by the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans&#x27; Illnesses, as DU was used in 30 mm and 25 mm cannon rounds on a large scale for the first time in the Gulf War. Veterans of the conflicts in the Persian Gulf, Bosnia and Kosovo have been found to have up to 14 times the usual level of chromosome abnormalities in their genes. Serum-soluble genotoxic teratogens produce congenital disorders, and in white blood cells causes immune system damage.

A 2005 epidemiology review concluded: &quot;In aggregate the human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in offspring of persons exposed to DU.&quot; A 2001 study of 15,000 February 1991 U.S. Gulf War combat veterans and 15,000 control veterans found that the Gulf War veterans were 1.8 (fathers) to 2.8 (mothers) times as likely to have children with birth defects. After examination of children&#x27;s medical records two years later, the birth defect rate increased by more than 20%:

In early 2004, the UK Pensions Appeal Tribunal Service attributed birth defect claims from a February 1991 Gulf War combat veteran to depleted uranium poisoning. Looking at the risk of children of UK Gulf War veterans suffering genetic diseases such as congenital malformations, commonly called &quot;birth defects&quot;, one study found that the overall risk of any malformation was 50% higher in Gulf War veterans as compared to other veterans.

The U.S. Army has commissioned ongoing research into potential risks of depleted uranium and other projectile weapon materials like tungsten, which the U.S. Navy has used in place of DU since 1993. Studies by the U.S. Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute conclude that moderate exposures to either depleted uranium or uranium present a significant toxicological threat.

In 2003, Professor Brian Spratt FRS, chairman of the Royal Society&#x27;s working group on depleted uranium, said: &quot;The question of who carries out the initial monitoring and clean-up is a political rather than scientific question,&quot; and &quot;the coalition needs to acknowledge that depleted uranium is a potential hazard and make in-roads into tackling it by being open about where and how much depleted uranium has been deployed.&quot;

A 2008 review of all relevant articles appearing in the peer-reviewed journals on MEDLINE through to the end of 2007, including multiple cohort studies of veterans, found no consistent evidence of excess risks of neoplasms that could have some link to DU, and that &quot;[t]he overall incidence of cancers is not increased in the cohort studies of Gulf war and Balkans veterans&quot;.

One particular subgroup of veterans that may be at higher risk comprises those who have internally retained fragments of DU from shrapnel wounds. A laboratory study on rats produced by the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute showed that, after a study period of 6 months, rats treated with depleted uranium coming from implanted pellets, comparable to the average levels in the urine of Desert Storm veterans with retained DU fragments, had developed a significant tendency to lose weight with respect to the control group.

Substantial amounts of uranium were accumulating in their brains and central nervous systems, and showed a significant reduction of neuronal activity in the hippocampus in response to external stimuli. The conclusions of the study show that brain damage from chronic uranium intoxication is possible at lower doses than previously thought. Results from computer-based neurocognitive tests performed in 1997 showed an association between uranium in the urine and &quot;problematic performance on automated tests assessing performance efficiency and accuracy.&quot;

A 2021 report concluded that uranium from exploding munitions did not lead to Gulf War illness (GWI) in veterans deployed in the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The study found no differences in secretion of uranium isotopic ratios from those meeting the standard-case definitions of GWI and control veterans without GWI. The researchers say that the most likely remaining causes for GWI are widespread low-level exposure to sarin nerve gas released by the destruction of Iraqi chemical weapons storage facilities in January 1991. This was possibly compounded by the use of anti-nerve agent medications and the use of pesticides to prevent insect-borne diseases in coalition forces.

===Iraqi population===
Since 2001, medical personnel working for the Iraqi state health service controlled by Saddam Hussein at the Basra hospital in southern Iraq have reported a sharp increase in the incidence of child leukemia and genetic malformation among babies born in the decade following the Gulf War. Iraqi doctors attributed these malformations to possible long-term effects of DU, an opinion that was echoed by several newspapers. In 2004, Iraq had the highest mortality rate due to leukemia of any country. In 2003, the Royal Society called for Western militaries to disclose where and how much DU they had used in Iraq so that rigorous, and hopefully conclusive, studies could be undertaken in affected areas. The International Coalition to Ban Uranium Weapons (ICBUW) likewise urged that an epidemiological study be made in the Basra region, as requested by Iraqi doctors, but no peer-reviewed study has yet been undertaken in Basra.

A medical survey, &quot;Cancer, Infant Mortality and Birth Sex Ratio in Fallujah, Iraq 2005–2009&quot; published in July 2010, states that the &quot;...increases in cancer and birth defects...are alarmingly high&quot; and that infant mortality 2009/2010 has reached 13.6%. The group compares the dramatic increase, five years after wartime exposure in 2004, with the lymphoma that Italian peacekeepers developed after the Balkan wars and the increased cancer risk in certain parts of Sweden because of the Chernobyl fallout. The origin and time of introduction of the carcinogenic agent causing the genetic stress was expected to be addressed by the group in a separate report. The report mentions depleted uranium as one &quot;potentially relevant exposure&quot; but makes no conclusions on the source.

Four studies investigating links between the use of depleted uranium by Coalition forces during the Second Battle of Fallujah were conducted in 2012, one of which described the people of Fallujah as having &quot;the highest rate of genetic damage in any population ever studied.&quot; In response to these studies, Ross Caputi, a former U.S. Marine who participated in the battle, wrote a Guardian newspaper article calling for the United States government to conduct its own study into the matter.

===The Balkans===

In 2001, the World Health Organization reported that data from Kosovo was inconclusive and called for further studies. That same year, governments of several European countries, particularly Italy, reported an increase in illnesses and developments of cancers among veterans that served in Balkan peacekeeping missions.

A 2003 study by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in Bosnia and Herzegovina stated that low levels of contaminant were found in drinking water and air particulate at DU penetrator impact points. The levels were stated as not a cause for alarm. Yet, Pekka Haavisto, chairman of the UNEP DU projects stated, &quot;The findings of this study stress again the importance of appropriate clean-up and civil protection measures in a post-conflict situation.&quot;

A team of Italian scientists from the University of Siena reported in 2005 that, although DU was &quot;clearly&quot; added to the soil in the study area, &quot;the phenomenon was very limited spatially and the total uranium concentrations fell within the natural range of the element in soils. Moreover, the absolute uranium concentrations indicate that there was no contamination of the earthworm species studied.&quot;

Though a more comprehensive assessment is possible, a 2011 update on a cancer scare regarding Italian soldiers who had served in the Balkans found lower than expected incidence rates for all cancers, a finding &quot;consistent with lacking evidence of an increased cancer incidence among troops of other countries deployed in the areas of Iraq, Bosnia, and Kosovo, where armour-penetrating depleted uranium shells have been used.&quot;

In 2018, Serbia set up a commission of inquiry into the consequences of the use of depleted uranium during the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in southern Serbia and its link to the rise of diseases and tumors among citizens, particularly in young children born after 1999. Zoran Radovanovic, an epidemiologist and the chairman of the Serbian Medical Association&#x27;s ethics committee, denied that there had been a rise in cancer cases in areas where bombings had taken place. He continued by saying that Serbians frequently worry about a cancer epidemic that does not exist. NATO has repeatedly claimed that depleted uranium found in the ammunition used in the 1999 bombardments cannot be linked to adverse health effects.

===Okinawa, Japan===
Between 1995 and 1996, U.S. Marine AV-8B Harrier jets accidentally fired more than 1,500 DU rounds at the Tori Shima gunnery range. The military did not notify the Japanese government until January 1997.

===Sardinia, Italy===
Depleted uranium has been named as a possible contributing factor to a high incidence of birth defects and cancer near the Salto di Quirra weapons testing range on the Italian island of Sardinia.

===Afghan War===
The Canadian Uranium Medical Research Centre obtained urine samples from bombed civilian areas in Jalalabad that showed concentrations of of undepleted uranium, far higher than the typical concentration in the British population of ≈.

===Remscheid, Germany===

On 8 December 1988, an A-10 Thunderbolt II attack jet of the United States Air Force crashed onto a residential area in the city of Remscheid, West Germany. The aircraft crashed into the upper floor of an apartment complex. In addition to the pilot, five people were killed. Fifty others were injured, many of them seriously. When the number of cancer cases in the vicinity of the accident rose disproportionately in the years after, suspicion rose that the depleted uranium ballast in the jet may have been the cause.

This was denied by the US military. However, 70 tons of top soil from the accident scene was removed and taken away to a depot. Film material taken during the top-soil removal show radiation warning signs. 120 residents and rescue workers reported skin diseases. Medical diagnosis concluded that these symptoms related to toxic irritative dermatitis.

===Atmospheric contamination===
Elevated radiation levels consistent with very low level atmospheric depleted uranium contamination have been found in air samples taken by the UK Atomic Weapons Establishment at several monitoring sites in Britain. These elevated readings appear to coincide with Operation Anaconda in Afghanistan, and the Shock and Awe bombing campaign at the start of the Second Gulf War.

===Other contamination cases===
On 4 October 1992, an El Al Boeing 747-F cargo aircraft (Flight 1862) crashed into an apartment building in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Local residents and rescue workers complained of various unexplained health issues, which were being attributed to the release of hazardous materials during the crash and subsequent fires. Authorities conducted an epidemiological study in 2000 of those believed to be affected by the accident. The study concluded that there was no evidence to link depleted uranium (used as counterbalance weights on the elevators of the plane) to any of the reported health complaints.

There have been accidents involving uranium hexafluoride in the United States, including one in which 32 workers were exposed to a cloud of and its reaction products in 1986 at a Gore, Oklahoma, commercial uranium conversion facility. One person died; while a few workers with higher exposure experienced short-term kidney damage (e.g., protein in the urine), none of them showed lasting damage from the exposure to uranium.

<text>A shaped charge is an explosive charge shaped to focus the effect of the explosive&#x27;s energy. Different types of shaped charges are used for various purposes such as cutting and forming metal, initiating nuclear weapons, penetrating armor, or perforating wells in the oil and gas industry.

A typical modern shaped charge, with a metal liner on the charge cavity, can penetrate armor steel to a depth of seven or more times the diameter of the charge (charge diameters, CD), though depths of 10 CD and above have been achieved. Contrary to a misconception, possibly resulting from the acronym &quot;HEAT&quot; (high-explosive anti-tank), the shaped charge does not depend in any way on heating or melting for its effectiveness; that is, the jet from a shaped charge does not melt its way through armor, as its effect is purely kinetic in nature – however the process creates significant heat and often has a significant secondary incendiary effect &quot;after&quot; penetration.

==Munroe effect==
The Munroe or Neumann effect is the focusing of blast energy by a hollow or void cut on a surface of an explosive. The earliest mention of hollow charges were mentioned in 1792. Franz Xaver von Baader (1765–1841) was a German mining engineer at that time; in a mining journal, he advocated a conical space at the forward end of a blasting charge to increase the explosive&#x27;s effect and thereby save powder. The idea was adopted, for a time, in Norway and in the mines of the Harz mountains of Germany, although the only available explosive at the time was gunpowder, which is not a high explosive and hence incapable of producing the shock wave that the shaped-charge effect requires.

The first true hollow charge effect was achieved in 1883, by Max von Foerster (1845–1905), chief of the nitrocellulose factory of Wolff &amp; Co. in Walsrode, Germany.

By 1886, Gustav Bloem of Düsseldorf, Germany, had filed for hemispherical cavity metal detonators to concentrate the effect of the explosion in an axial direction. The Munroe effect is named after Charles E. Munroe, who discovered it in 1888. As a civilian chemist working at the U.S. Naval Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island, he noticed that when a block of explosive guncotton with the manufacturer&#x27;s name stamped into it was detonated next to a metal plate, the lettering was cut into the plate. Conversely, if letters were raised in relief above the surface of the explosive, then the letters on the plate would also be raised above its surface. In 1894, Munroe constructed his first crude shaped charge:

Among the experiments made ... was one upon a safe twenty-nine inches cube, with walls four inches and three quarters thick, made up of plates of iron and steel ... When a hollow charge of dynamite nine pounds and a half in weight and untamped was detonated on it, a hole three inches in diameter was blown clear through the wall ... The hollow cartridge was made by tying the sticks of dynamite around a tin can, the open mouth of the latter being placed downward.

Although Munroe&#x27;s experiment with the shaped charge was widely publicized in 1900 in &quot;Popular Science Monthly&quot;, the importance of the tin can &quot;liner&quot; of the hollow charge remained unrecognized for another 44 years. Part of that 1900 article was reprinted in the February 1945 issue of &quot;Popular Science&quot;, describing how shaped-charge warheads worked. It was this article that at last revealed to the general public how the United States Army &quot;bazooka&quot; actually worked against armored vehicles during WWII.

In 1910, Egon Neumann of Germany discovered that a block of TNT, which would normally dent a steel plate, punched a hole through it if the explosive had a conical indentation. The military usefulness of Munroe&#x27;s and Neumann&#x27;s work was unappreciated for a long time. Between the world wars, academics in several countries Myron Yakovlevich Sukharevskii (Мирон Яковлевич Сухаревский) in the Soviet Union, William H. Payment and Donald Whitley Woodhead in Britain, and Robert Williams Wood in the U.S. recognized that projectiles could form during explosions. 

In 1932 Franz Rudolf Thomanek, a student of physics at Vienna&#x27;s &quot;Technische Hochschule&quot;, conceived an anti-tank round that was based on the hollow charge effect. When the Austrian government showed no interest in pursuing the idea, Thomanek moved to Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Technische Hochschule&quot;, where he continued his studies under the ballistics expert Carl Julius Cranz. There in 1935, he and Hellmuth von Huttern developed a prototype anti-tank round. Although the weapon&#x27;s performance proved disappointing, Thomanek continued his developmental work, collaborating with Hubert Schardin at the &quot;Waffeninstitut der Luftwaffe&quot; (Air Force Weapons Institute) in Braunschweig.

By 1937, Schardin believed that hollow-charge effects were due to the interactions of shock waves. It was during the testing of this idea that, on February 4, 1938, Thomanek conceived the shaped-charge explosive (or &quot;Hohlladungs-Auskleidungseffekt&quot; (hollow-charge liner effect)). (It was Gustav Adolf Thomer who in 1938 first visualized, by flash radiography, the metallic jet produced by a shaped-charge explosion.) Meanwhile, Henry Hans Mohaupt, a chemical engineer in Switzerland, had independently developed a shaped-charge munition in 1935, which was demonstrated to the Swiss, French, British, and U.S. militaries.

During World War II, shaped-charge munitions were developed by Germany (Panzerschreck, Panzerfaust, Panzerwurfmine, Mistel), Britain (No. 68 AT grenade, PIAT, Beehive cratering charge), the Soviet Union (RPG-43, RPG-6), the U.S. (M9 rifle grenade, bazooka), and Italy (&quot;Effetto Pronto Speciale&quot; shells for various artillery pieces). The development of shaped charges revolutionized anti-tank warfare. Tanks faced a serious vulnerability from a weapon that could be carried by an infantryman or aircraft.

One of the earliest uses of shaped charges was by German glider-borne troops against the Belgian Fort Eben-Emael in 1940. These demolition charges – developed by Dr. Wuelfken of the German Ordnance Office – were &quot;unlined&quot; explosive charges and did not produce a metal jet like the modern HEAT warheads.
Due to the lack of metal liner they shook the turrets but they did not destroy them, and other airborne troops were forced to climb on the turrets and smash the gun barrels.

==Applications==

===Modern military===

The common term in military terminology for shaped-charge warheads is high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead. HEAT warheads are frequently used in anti-tank guided missiles, unguided rockets, gun-fired projectiles (both spun (spin stabilized) and unspun), rifle grenades, land mines, bomblets, torpedoes, and various other weapons.

====Protection====
During World War II, the precision of the charge&#x27;s construction and its detonation mode were both inferior to modern warheads. This lower precision caused the jet to curve and to break up at an earlier time and hence at a shorter distance. The resulting dispersion decreased the penetration depth for a given cone diameter and also shortened the optimum standoff distance. Since the charges were less effective at larger standoffs, side and turret skirts (known as &quot;Schürzen&quot;) fitted to some German tanks to protect against ordinary anti-tank rifles were fortuitously found to give the jet room to disperse and hence also reduce HEAT penetration.

The use of add-on spaced armor skirts on armored vehicles may have the opposite effect and actually &quot;increase&quot; the penetration of some shaped-charge warheads. Due to constraints in the length of the projectile/missile, the built-in stand-off on many warheads is less than the optimum distance. In such cases, the skirting effectively increases the distance between the armor and the target, and the warhead detonates closer to its optimum standoff. Skirting should not be confused with cage armor which is primarily used to damage the fusing system of RPG-7 projectiles, but can also cause a HEAT projectile to pitch up or down on impact, lengthening the penetration path for the shaped charge&#x27;s penetration stream. If the nose probe strikes one of the cage armor slats, the warhead will function as normal.

===Non-military===
In non-military applications shaped charges are used in explosive demolition of buildings and structures, in particular for cutting through metal piles, columns and beams and for boring holes. In steelmaking, small shaped charges are often used to pierce taps that have become plugged with slag. They are also used in quarrying, breaking up ice, breaking log jams, felling trees, and drilling post holes.

Shaped charges are used most extensively in the petroleum and natural gas industries, in particular in the completion of oil and gas wells, in which they are detonated to perforate the metal casing of the well at intervals to admit the influx of oil and gas. Another use in the industry is to put out oil and gas fires by depriving the fire of oxygen.

A shaped charge was used on the Hayabusa2 mission on asteroid 162173 Ryugu. The spacecraft dropped the explosive device onto the asteroid and detonated it with the spacecraft behind cover. The detonation dug a crater about 10 meters wide, to provide access to a pristine sample of the asteroid.

==Function==
A typical device consists of a solid cylinder of explosive with a metal-lined conical hollow in one end and a central detonator, array of detonators, or detonation wave guide at the other end. Explosive energy is released directly away from (normal to) the surface of an explosive, so shaping the explosive will concentrate the explosive energy in the void. If the hollow is properly shaped, usually conically, the enormous pressure generated by the detonation of the explosive drives the liner in the hollow cavity inward to collapse upon its central axis. 

The resulting collision forms and projects a high-velocity jet of metal particles forward along the axis. Most of the jet material originates from the innermost part of the liner, a layer of about 10% to 20% of the thickness. The rest of the liner forms a slower-moving slug of material, which, because of its appearance, is sometimes called a &quot;carrot&quot;.

Because of the variation along the liner in its collapse velocity, the jet&#x27;s velocity also varies along its length, decreasing from the front. This variation in jet velocity stretches it and eventually leads to its break-up into particles. Over time, the particles tend to fall out of alignment, which reduces the depth of penetration at long standoffs.

At the apex of the cone, which forms the very front of the jet, the liner does not have time to be fully accelerated before it forms its part of the jet. This results in its small part of jet being projected at a lower velocity than jet formed later behind it. As a result, the initial parts of the jet coalesce to form a pronounced wider tip portion.

Most of the jet travels at hypersonic speed. The tip moves at 7 to 14 km/s, the jet tail at a lower velocity (1 to 3 km/s), and the slug at a still lower velocity (less than 1 km/s). The exact velocities depend on the charge&#x27;s configuration and confinement, explosive type, materials used, and the explosive-initiation mode. At typical velocities, the penetration process generates such enormous pressures that it may be considered hydrodynamic; to a good approximation, the jet and armor may be treated as inviscid, compressible fluids (see, for example,), with their material strengths ignored.

A recent technique using magnetic diffusion analysis showed that the temperature of the outer 50% by volume of a copper jet tip while in flight was between 1100K and 1200K, much closer to the melting point of copper (1358 K) than previously assumed. This temperature is consistent with a hydrodynamic calculation that simulated the entire experiment. In comparison, two-color radiometry measurements from the late 1970s indicate lower temperatures for various shaped-charge liner material, cone construction and type of explosive filler. 

A Comp-B loaded shaped charge with a copper liner and pointed cone apex had a jet tip temperature ranging from 668 K to 863 K over a five shot sampling. Octol-loaded charges with a rounded cone apex generally had higher surface temperatures with an average of 810 K, and the temperature of a tin-lead liner with Comp-B fill averaged 842 K. While the tin-lead jet was determined to be liquid, the copper jets are well below the melting point of copper. However, these temperatures are not completely consistent with evidence that soft recovered copper jet particles show signs of melting at the core while the outer portion remains solid and cannot be equated with bulk temperature.

The location of the charge relative to its target is critical for optimum penetration for two reasons. If the charge is detonated too close there is not enough time for the jet to fully develop. But the jet disintegrates and disperses after a relatively short distance, usually well under two meters. At such standoffs, it breaks into particles which tend to tumble and drift off the axis of penetration, so that the successive particles tend to widen rather than deepen the hole. At very long standoffs, velocity is lost to air drag, further degrading penetration.

The key to the effectiveness of the hollow charge is its diameter. As the penetration continues through the target, the width of the hole decreases leading to a characteristic &quot;fist to finger&quot; action, where the size of the eventual &quot;finger&quot; is based on the size of the original &quot;fist&quot;. In general, shaped charges can penetrate a steel plate as thick as 150% to 700% of their diameter, depending on the charge quality. The figure is for basic steel plate, not for the composite armor, reactive armor, or other types of modern armor.

===Liner===
The most common shape of the liner is conical, with an internal apex angle of 40 to 90 degrees. Different apex angles yield different distributions of jet mass and velocity. Small apex angles can result in jet , or even in the failure of the jet to form at all; this is attributed to the collapse velocity being above a certain threshold, normally slightly higher than the liner material&#x27;s bulk sound speed. Other widely used shapes include hemispheres, tulips, trumpets, ellipses, and bi-conics; the various shapes yield jets with different velocity and mass distributions.

Liners have been made from many materials, including various metals and glass. The deepest penetrations are achieved with a dense, ductile metal, and a very common choice has been copper. For some modern anti-armor weapons, molybdenum and pseudo-alloys of tungsten filler and copper binder (9:1, thus density is ≈18 Mg/m3) have been adopted. Nearly every common metallic element has been tried, including aluminum, tungsten, tantalum, depleted uranium, lead, tin, cadmium, cobalt, magnesium, titanium, zinc, zirconium, molybdenum, beryllium, nickel, silver, and even gold and platinum. The selection of the material depends on the target to be penetrated; for example, aluminum has been found advantageous for concrete targets.

In early antitank weapons, copper was used as a liner material. Later, in the 1970s, it was found tantalum is superior to copper, due to its much higher density and very high ductility at high strain rates. Other high-density metals and alloys tend to have drawbacks in terms of price, toxicity, radioactivity, or lack of ductility.

For the deepest penetrations, pure metals yield the best results, because they display the greatest ductility, which delays the breakup of the jet into particles as it stretches. In charges for oil well completion, however, it is essential that a solid slug or &quot;carrot&quot; not be formed, since it would plug the hole just penetrated and interfere with the influx of oil. In the petroleum industry, therefore, liners are generally fabricated by powder metallurgy, often of pseudo-alloys which, if unsintered, yield jets that are composed mainly of dispersed fine metal particles.

Unsintered cold pressed liners, however, are not waterproof and tend to be brittle, which makes them easy to damage during handling. Bimetallic liners, usually zinc-lined copper, can be used; during jet formation the zinc layer vaporizes and a slug is not formed; the disadvantage is an increased cost and dependency of jet formation on the quality of bonding the two layers. Low-melting-point (below 500 °C) solder- or braze-like alloys (e.g., Sn50Pb50, Zn97.6Pb1.6, or pure metals like lead, zinc, or cadmium) can be used; these melt before reaching the well casing, and the molten metal does not obstruct the hole. Other alloys, binary eutectics (e.g. Pb88.8Sb11.1, Sn61.9Pd38.1, or Ag71.9Cu28.1), form a metal-matrix composite material with ductile matrix with brittle dendrites; such materials reduce slug formation but are difficult to shape.

A metal-matrix composite with discrete inclusions of low-melting material is another option; the inclusions either melt before the jet reaches the well casing, weakening the material, or serve as crack nucleation sites, and the slug breaks up on impact. The dispersion of the second phase can be achieved also with castable alloys (e.g., copper) with a low-melting-point metal insoluble in copper, such as bismuth, 1–5% lithium, or up to 50% (usually 15–30%) lead; the size of inclusions can be adjusted by thermal treatment. Non-homogeneous distribution of the inclusions can also be achieved. Other additives can modify the alloy properties; tin (4–8%), nickel (up to 30% and often together with tin), up to 8% aluminium, phosphorus (forming brittle phosphides) or 1–5% silicon form brittle inclusions serving as crack initiation sites. Up to 30% zinc can be added to lower the material cost and to form additional brittle phases.

Oxide glass liners produce jets of low density, therefore yielding less penetration depth. Double-layer liners, with one layer of a less dense but pyrophoric metal (e.g. aluminum or magnesium), can be used to enhance incendiary effects following the armor-piercing action; explosive welding can be used for making those, as then the metal-metal interface is homogeneous, does not contain significant amount of intermetallics, and does not have adverse effects to the formation of the jet.

The penetration depth is proportional to the maximum length of the jet, which is a product of the jet tip velocity and time to particulation. The jet tip velocity depends on bulk sound velocity in the liner material, the time to particulation is dependent on the ductility of the material. The maximum achievable jet velocity is roughly 2.34 times the sound velocity in the material. The speed can reach 10 km/s, peaking some 40 microseconds after detonation; the cone tip is subjected to acceleration of about 25 million g. The jet tail reaches about 2–5 km/s. The pressure between the jet tip and the target can reach one terapascal. The immense pressure makes the metal flow like a liquid, though x-ray diffraction has shown the metal stays solid; one of the theories explaining this behavior proposes molten core and solid sheath of the jet. The best materials are face-centered cubic metals, as they are the most ductile, but even graphite and zero-ductility ceramic cones show significant penetration.

===Explosive charge===
For optimal penetration, a high explosive with a high detonation velocity and pressure is normally chosen. The most common explosive used in high performance anti-armor warheads is HMX (octogen), although never in its pure form, as it would be too sensitive. It is normally compounded with a few percent of some type of plastic binder, such as in the polymer-bonded explosive (PBX) LX-14, or with another less-sensitive explosive, such as TNT, with which it forms Octol. Other common high-performance explosives are RDX-based compositions, again either as PBXs or mixtures with TNT (to form Composition B and the Cyclotols) or wax (Cyclonites). Some explosives incorporate powdered aluminum to increase their blast and detonation temperature, but this addition generally results in decreased performance of the shaped charge. There has been research into using the very high-performance but sensitive explosive CL-20 in shaped-charge warheads, but, at present, due to its sensitivity, this has been in the form of the PBX composite LX-19 (CL-20 and Estane binder).

===Other features===
A &#x27;waveshaper&#x27; is a body (typically a disc or cylindrical block) of an inert material (typically solid or foamed plastic, but sometimes metal, perhaps hollow) inserted within the explosive for the purpose of changing the path of the detonation wave. The effect is to modify the collapse of the cone and resulting jet formation, with the intent of increasing penetration performance. Waveshapers are often used to save space; a shorter charge with a waveshaper can achieve the same performance as a longer charge without a waveshaper. Given that the space of possible waveshapes is infinite, machine learning methods have been developed to engineer more optimal waveshapers that can enhance the performance of a shaped charge via computational design.

Another useful design feature is &quot;sub-calibration&quot;, the use of a liner having a smaller diameter (caliber) than the explosive charge. In an ordinary charge, the explosive near the base of the cone is so thin that it is unable to accelerate the adjacent liner to sufficient velocity to form an effective jet. In a sub-calibrated charge, this part of the device is effectively cut off, resulting in a shorter charge with the same performance.

==Variants==
There are several forms of shaped charge.

===Linear shaped charges===
A linear shaped charge (LSC) has a lining with V-shaped profile and varying length. The lining is surrounded with explosive, the explosive then encased within a suitable material that serves to protect the explosive and to confine (tamp) it on detonation. &quot;At detonation, the focusing of the explosive high pressure wave as it becomes incident to the side wall causes the metal liner of the LSC to collapse–creating the cutting force.&quot; The detonation projects into the lining, to form a continuous, knife-like (planar) jet. The jet cuts any material in its path, to a depth depending on the size and materials used in the charge. Generally, the jet penetrates around 1 to 1.2 times the charge width. For the cutting of complex geometries, there are also flexible versions of the linear shaped charge, these with a lead or high-density foam sheathing and a ductile/flexible lining material, which also is often lead. LSCs are commonly used in the cutting of rolled steel joists (RSJ) and other structural targets, such as in the controlled demolition of buildings. LSCs are also used to separate the stages of multistage rockets, and destroy them when they go errant.

===Explosively formed penetrator===


The explosively formed penetrator (EFP) is also known as the self-forging fragment (SFF), explosively formed projectile (EFP), self-forging projectile (SEFOP), plate charge, and Misnay-Schardin (MS) charge. An EFP uses the action of the explosive&#x27;s detonation wave (and to a lesser extent the propulsive effect of its detonation products) to project and deform a plate or dish of ductile metal (such as copper, iron, or tantalum) into a compact high-velocity projectile, commonly called the slug. This slug is projected toward the target at about two kilometers per second. The chief advantage of the EFP over a conventional (e.g., conical) shaped charge is its effectiveness at very great standoffs, equal to hundreds of times the charge&#x27;s diameter (perhaps a hundred meters for a practical device).

The EFP is relatively unaffected by first-generation reactive armor and can travel up to perhaps 1000 charge diameters (CD)s before its velocity becomes ineffective at penetrating armor due to aerodynamic drag, or successfully hitting the target becomes a problem. The impact of a ball or slug EFP normally causes a large-diameter but relatively shallow hole, of, at most, a couple of CDs. If the EFP perforates the armor, spalling and extensive behind armor effects (BAE, also called behind armor damage, BAD) will occur. 

The BAE is mainly caused by the high-temperature and high-velocity armor and slug fragments being injected into the interior space and the blast overpressure caused by this debris. More modern EFP warhead versions, through the use of advanced initiation modes, can also produce long-rods (stretched slugs), multi-slugs and finned rod/slug projectiles. The long-rods are able to penetrate a much greater depth of armor, at some loss to BAE, multi-slugs are better at defeating light or area targets and the finned projectiles are much more accurate.

The use of this warhead type is mainly restricted to lightly armored areas of main battle tanks (MBT) such as the top, belly and rear armored areas. It is well suited for the attack of other less heavily protected armored fighting vehicles (AFV) and in the breaching of material targets (buildings, bunkers, bridge supports, etc.). The newer rod projectiles may be effective against the more heavily armored areas of MBTs. Weapons using the EFP principle have already been used in combat; the &quot;smart&quot; submunitions in the CBU-97 cluster bomb used by the US Air Force and Navy in the 2003 Iraq war employed this principle, and the US Army is reportedly experimenting with precision-guided artillery shells under Project SADARM (Seek And Destroy ARMor). There are also various other projectile (BONUS, DM 642) and rocket submunitions (Motiv-3M, DM 642) and mines (MIFF, TMRP-6) that use EFP principle. Examples of EFP warheads are US patents 5038683 and US6606951.

===Tandem warhead===
Some modern anti-tank rockets (RPG-27, RPG-29) and missiles (TOW-2, TOW-2A, Eryx, HOT, MILAN) use a tandem warhead shaped charge, consisting of two separate shaped charges, one in front of the other, typically with some distance between them. TOW-2A was the first to use tandem warheads in the mid-1980s, an aspect of the weapon which the US Army had to reveal under news media and Congressional pressure resulting from the concern that NATO antitank missiles were ineffective against Soviet tanks that were fitted with the new ERA boxes. The Army revealed that a 40 mm precursor shaped-charge warhead was fitted on the tip of the TOW-2 and TOW-2A collapsible probe. 

Usually, the front charge is somewhat smaller than the rear one, as it is intended primarily to disrupt ERA boxes or tiles. Examples of tandem warheads are US patents 7363862 and US 5561261. The US Hellfire antiarmor missile is one of the few that have accomplished the complex engineering feat of having two shaped charges of the same diameter stacked in one warhead. Recently, a Russian arms firm revealed a 125mm tank cannon round with two same diameter shaped charges one behind the other, but with the back one offset so its penetration stream will not interfere with the front shaped charge&#x27;s penetration stream. The reasoning behind both the Hellfire and the Russian 125 mm munitions having tandem same diameter warheads is not to increase penetration, but to increase the beyond-armour effect.

===Voitenko compressor===

In 1964 a Soviet scientist proposed that a shaped charge originally developed for piercing thick steel armor be adapted to the task of accelerating shock waves. The resulting device, looking a little like a wind tunnel, is called a Voitenko compressor. The Voitenko compressor initially separates a test gas from a shaped charge with a malleable steel plate. When the shaped charge detonates, most of its energy is focused on the steel plate, driving it forward and pushing the test gas ahead of it. Ames Laboratory translated this idea into a self-destroying shock tube. A 66-pound shaped charge accelerated the gas in a 3-cm glass-walled tube 2 meters in length. The velocity of the resulting shock wave was 220,000 feet per second (67 km/s). The apparatus exposed to the detonation was completely destroyed, but not before useful data was extracted.

In a typical Voitenko compressor, a shaped charge accelerates hydrogen gas which in turn accelerates a thin disk up to about 40 km/s. A slight modification to the Voitenko compressor concept is a super-compressed detonation, a device that uses a compressible liquid or solid fuel in the steel compression chamber instead of a traditional gas mixture. A further extension of this technology is the explosive diamond anvil cell, utilizing multiple opposed shaped-charge jets projected at a single steel encapsulated fuel, such as hydrogen. The fuels used in these devices, along with the secondary combustion reactions and long blast impulse, produce similar conditions to those encountered in fuel-air and thermobaric explosives.

===Nuclear shaped charges===
The proposed Project Orion nuclear propulsion system would have required the development of nuclear shaped charges for reaction acceleration of spacecraft. Shaped-charge effects driven by nuclear explosions have been discussed speculatively, but are not known to have been produced in fact. For example, the early nuclear weapons designer Ted Taylor was quoted as saying, in the context of shaped charges, &quot;A one-kiloton fission device, shaped properly, could make a hole in diameter a thousand feet (305 m) into solid rock.&quot; Also, a nuclear driven explosively formed penetrator was apparently proposed for terminal ballistic missile defense in the 1960s.

<text>An anti-tank guided missile (ATGM), anti-tank missile, anti-tank guided weapon (ATGW) or anti-armor guided weapon is a guided missile primarily designed to hit and destroy heavily armored military vehicles. ATGMs range in size from shoulder-launched weapons, which can be transported by a single soldier, to larger tripod-mounted weapons, which require a squad or team to transport and fire, to vehicle and aircraft mounted missile systems.

Earlier man-portable anti-tank weapons, like anti-tank rifles and magnetic anti-tank mines, generally had very short range, sometimes on the order of metres or tens of metres. Rocket-propelled high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) systems appeared in World War II and extended range to the order of hundreds of metres, but accuracy was low and hitting targets at these ranges was largely a matter of luck. It was the combination of rocket propulsion and remote wire guidance that made the ATGM much more effective than these earlier weapons, and gave light infantry real capability on the battlefield against post-war tank designs. The introduction of semi-automatic guidance in the 1960s further improved the performance of ATGMs.

 ATGMs were used by over 130 countries and many non-state actors around the world. Post-Cold-War main battle tanks (MBTs) using composite and reactive armors have proven to be resistant to smaller ATGMs.

==History==

===World War II===
Germany developed a design for a wire-guided anti tank missile derived from the Ruhrstahl X-4 air to air missile concept in the closing years of World War II. Known as the X-7, it was probably never used in combat and allegedly had serious guidance to target issues. It never entered service, though a few were produced.

===Early Cold War: first generation ATGMs===
First-generation ATGMs use a type of command guidance termed &quot;manual command to line of sight&quot; (MCLOS). This requires continuous input from an operator using a joystick or similar control system to steer the missile to a target. One disadvantage of this is that an operator must keep the sight&#x27;s reticle cross hairs on a target and then steer the missile into the cross hairs, i.e., the line-of-sight. To do this, an operator must be well trained (spending many hours on a simulator) and must remain stationary and in view of a target during the flight time of the missile. Because of this, the operator is vulnerable while guiding the missile. In addition to the low kill probability, other problems with first generation ATGMs include slow missile speed, high minimum effective range, and an inability to use top attack missiles.

The first system to become operational and to see combat was the French Nord SS.10 during the early 1950s. It entered service in the French Army in 1955. It was also the first anti-tank missile used by the US Army and Israeli Defense Forces. The Malkara missile (named from an Australian Aborigine word for &quot;shield&quot;) was another of the earliest ATGMs. It was jointly developed by Australia and the United Kingdom between 1951 and 1954, and was in service from 1958 until gradually replaced by the Vickers Vigilant missile in the late 1960s. It was intended to be light enough to deploy with airborne forces, yet powerful enough to knock out any tank then in service. It used a high-explosive squash head (HESH) warhead. Other early first generation ATGMs include the West German Cobra and the Soviet 9M14 Malyutka.

In 2012, first-generation systems were described as obsolete due to low hit probability, a limited ability to penetrate modern armour, and other issues. Still, many countries maintain significant stockpiles. Approximately, first generation ATGMs have an effective range of 1500m and the ability to penetrate 500mm of rolled homogeneous armor.

===Late Cold War: second generation ATGMs===
Second-generation semi-automatically command guided to line-of-sight, or semi-automatic command to line of sight (SACLOS) missiles require an operator to only keep the sights on the target until impact. Automatic guidance commands are sent to the missile through wires or radio, or the missile relies on laser marking or a TV camera view from the nose of the missile. Examples are the Russian 9M133 Kornet, Israeli LAHAT, the NLOS version of Spike, and the American Hellfire I missiles. The operator must remain stationary during the missile&#x27;s flight. The most widely used ATGM of all time, the American BGM-71 TOW, with hundreds of thousands of missiles built, is a second-generation system.

Second generation ATGMs are significantly easier to use than first generation systems, and accuracy rates may exceed 90%. Generally they have an effective range of between 2,500 and 5,500 meters and penetration of up to 900 mm of armor. Cost is around $10,000 USD per missile.

===Post Cold War: third generation ATGMs and later===
Third-generation &quot;fire-and-forget&quot; missiles rely on a laser, electro-optical imager (IIR) seeker or a W band radar seeker in the nose of the missile. Once the target is identified, the missile needs no further guidance during flight; it is &quot;fire-and-forget&quot;, and the missile operator is free to retreat. However, fire-and-forget missiles are more subject to electronic countermeasures than MCLOS and SACLOS missiles. Examples include the German PARS 3 LR and the Israeli Spike.

Most modern ATGMs have shaped charge HEAT warheads, designed specifically for penetrating tank armor. Tandem-charge missiles attempt to defeat explosive reactive armour (ERA): the small initial charge sets off the ERA while the follow-up main charge attempts to penetrate the main armor. Top-attack weapons such as the US Javelin, the Swedish Bill and the Indian Nag and MPATGM are designed to strike vehicles from above, where their armor is usually much weaker. Third generation systems and beyond are generally much more expensive than second generation systems.

===Fourth generation ATGMs===

Fourth generation fire-and-forget anti tank guided missiles have larger range and rely on a combination of seeker for guidance. Examples include India&#x27;s SANT, which has a stand-off range of , uses dual seeker configuration of electro-optical thermal imager (EO/IR) and millimeter-wave active radar homing for control and guidance with lock-on before launch and lock-on after launch capabilities.

===Fifth generation ATGMs===
Some ATGMs, notably the French Akeron MP and the latest variants of the Israeli Spike (such as the Spike LR2 and ER2), have been called &quot;5th generation&quot; by their manufacturers and marketed as such. They appear to have the following additional or amplified attributes:

The third generation Indian MPATGM included some of the aforementioned features. 

==Countermeasures==

Countermeasures against ATGMs include newer armors such as spaced, perforated, composite or explosive reactive armor, jammers like the Russian Shtora, active protection systems (APS) like the Israeli Trophy and the Russian Arena, and other methods.

===Newer armor===
Armor systems have continued in development alongside ATGMs, and the most recent generations of armor are specifically tested to be effective against ATGM strikes, either by deforming the missile warhead or fusing to prevent proper detonation (such as in slat armor) or using some form of reactive armor to &#x27;attack&#x27; the missile upon impact, disrupting the shaped charge that makes the warhead effective. Both come with the downside of significant weight and bulk. Reactive armor works best when a vehicle is specifically designed with the system integrated and while developments continue to make armor lighter, any vehicle that includes such a system necessitates a powerful engine and often will still be relatively slow. Inclusion of such armor in older vehicles as a part of a re-design is possible, as in the numerous types derived from the T-72. Slat armor is lighter and as such can be added to many vehicles after construction but still adds both bulk and weight. Particularly for vehicles that are designed to be transported by cargo aircraft, slat armor has to be fitted in the field after deployment. Either approach can never offer complete coverage over the vehicle, leaving tracks or wheels particularly vulnerable to attack.

===Jamming===
Jamming is potentially an effective countermeasure to specific missiles that are radar guided, however, as a general purpose defense, it is of no use against unguided anti-tank weapons, and as such it is almost never the only defense. If jamming is used continually, it can be extremely difficult for a missile to acquire the target, locking on to the much larger return from the jammer, with the operator unlikely noticing the difference without a radar screen to see the return. However, any missile that has a backup tracking system can defeat jamming.

===Active===
Active protection systems show a great deal of promise, both in counteracting ATGMs and unguided weapons. Compared to armor systems, they are very lightweight, can be fitted to almost any vehicle with the internal space for the control system and could, in the future, be a near-perfect defense against any missiles. The weaknesses of the systems include potential developments in missile design such as radar or IR decoys, which would drastically reduce their chance to intercept a missile, as well as technical challenges such as dealing with multiple missiles at once and designing a system that can cover a vehicle from any angle of attack. While these may be answered and allow for lightweight, highly maneuverable vehicles that are strongly defended against missiles and rockets that are extremely well suited for urban and guerrilla warfare, such a system is unlikely to be as effective against kinetic energy projectiles, making it a poor choice for fighting against tanks. As kinetic energy projectiles move faster than guided missiles, this often means that the sensors attached to an active protection system can not keep up.

===Other===
Traditionally, before &quot;fire-and-forget&quot; ATGMs were used, the most effective countermeasure was to open fire at the location where the missile was fired from, to either kill the operator or force them to take cover, thus sending the missile off course. Smoke screens can also be deployed from an MBT&#x27;s smoke discharger, and used to obscure an ATGM operator&#x27;s line of sight. Other improvised methods used by the Israel Defense Forces to defeat the Saggers involved firing in front of the tank to create dust. While fire-and-forget missiles have definitive advantages in terms of guidance and operator safety, and include abilities such as top attack mode, older missiles continue in use, both in the front line armies of less developed countries, and in reserve service the world over, due to their lower cost or existing stockpiles of less advanced weapons.

<text>Hoysala architecture is the building style in Hindu temple architecture developed under the rule of the Hoysala Empire between the 11th and 14th centuries, in the region known today as Karnataka, a state of India. Hoysala influence was at its peak in the 13th century, when it dominated the Southern Deccan Plateau region. Large and small temples built during this era remain as examples of the Hoysala architectural style, including the Chennakesava Temple at Belur, the Hoysaleswara Temple at Halebidu, and the Kesava Temple at Somanathapura. These three temples were accorded UNESCO world heritage site status in 2023. Other examples of Hoysala craftsmanship are the temples at Belavadi, Amruthapura, Hosaholalu, Mosale, Arasikere, Basaralu, Kikkeri and Nuggehalli. Study of the Hoysala architectural style has revealed a negligible North Indian influence while the impact of Southern Indian style is more distinct.

Temples built prior to Hoysala independence in the mid-12th century reflect significant Western Chalukya influences, while later temples retain some features salient to Western Chalukya architecture but have additional inventive decoration and ornamentation, features unique to Hoysala artisans. Some three hundred temples are known to survive in present-day Karnataka state and many more are mentioned in inscriptions, though only about seventy have been documented. The greatest concentration of these are in the Malnad (hill) districts, the native home of the Hoysala kings.

Hoysala architecture is classified by the influential scholar Adam Hardy as part of the &quot;Karnata Dravida&quot; tradition, a trend within Dravidian architecture in the Deccan that is distinct from the Tamil style of further south. Other terms for the tradition are Vesara, and Chalukya architecture, divided into early Badami Chalukya architecture and the Western Chalukya architecture which immediately preceded the Hoysalas. The whole tradition covers a period of about seven centuries began in the 7th century under the patronage of the Chalukya dynasty of Badami, developed further under the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta during the 9th and 10th centuries and the Western Chalukyas (or Later Chalukyas) of Basavakalyan in the 11th and 12th centuries. Its final development stage and transformation into an independent style was during the rule of the Hoysalas in the 12th and 13th centuries. Medieval inscriptions displayed prominently at temple locations give information about donations made toward the maintenance of the temple, details of consecration and on occasion, even architectural details.

==Temple deities==

Hinduism is a combination of secular and sacred beliefs, rituals, daily practices and traditions that has evolved over the course of over two thousand years and embodies complex symbolism combining the natural world with philosophy.

Hindu temples began as simple shrines housing a deity and by the time of the Hoysalas had evolved into well-articulated edifices in which worshippers sought transcendence of the daily world. Hoysala temples were not limited to any specifically organised tradition of Hinduism and encouraged pilgrims of different Hindu devotional movements. The Hoysalas usually dedicated their temples to Shiva or Vishnu (two of the popular Hindu gods), but they occasionally built some temples dedicated to the Jain faith as well. Worshippers of Shiva are called Shaivas and worshippers of Vishnu are called Vaishnavas. While King Vishnuvardhana and his descendants were Vaishnava by faith, records show that the Hoysalas maintained religious harmony by building as many temples dedicated to Shiva as they did to Vishnu.

Most of these temples have secular features with broad themes depicted in their sculptures. This can be seen in the famous Chennakesava Temple at Belur dedicated to Vishnu and in the Hoysaleswara temple at Halebidu dedicated to Shiva. The Kesava temple at Somanathapura is different in that its ornamentation is strictly Vaishnava. Generally Vaishnava temples are dedicated to Keshava (or to Chennakeshava, meaning &quot;Beautiful Vishnu&quot;) while a small number are dedicated to Lakshminarayana and Lakshminarasimha (Narayana and Narasimha both being Avatars, or physical manifestations, of Vishnu) with Lakshmi, consort of Vishnu, seated at his feet. Temples dedicated to Vishnu are always named after the deity.

The Shaiva temples have a Shiva linga, symbol of fertility and the universal symbol of Shiva, in the shrine. The names of Shiva temples can end with the suffix &quot;eshwara&quot; meaning &quot;Lord of&quot;. The name &quot;Hoysaleswara&quot;, for instance, means &quot;Lord of Hoysala&quot;. The temple can also be named after the devotee who commissioned the construction of the temple, an example being the Bucesvara temple at Koravangala, named after the devotee Buci. The most striking sculptural decorations are the horizontal rows of mouldings with detailed relief, and intricately carved images of gods, goddesses and their attendants on the outer temple wall panels.

The Doddagaddavalli Lakshmi Devi (&quot;Goddess of Wealth&quot;) Temple is an exception as it is dedicated to neither Vishnu nor Shiva. The defeat of the Jain Western Ganga Dynasty (of present-day south Karnataka) by the Cholas in the early 11th century and the rising numbers of followers of Vaishnava Hinduism and Virashaivism in the 12th century was mirrored by a decreased interest in Jainism. However, two notable locations of Jain worship in the Hoysala territory were Shravanabelagola and Kambadahalli. The Hoysalas built Jain temples to satisfy the needs of its Jain population, a few of which have survived in Halebidu containing icons of Jain tirthankaras. They constructed stepped wells called &quot;Pushkarni&quot; or &quot;Kalyani&quot;, the ornate tank at Hulikere being an example. The tank has twelve minor shrines containing Hindu deities.

The two main deities found in Hoysala temple sculpture are Shiva and Vishnu in their various forms and avatars (incarnations). Shiva is usually shown with four arms holding a trident and a small drum among other emblems that symbolise objects worshiped independently of the divine image with which they are associated. Any male icon portrayed in this way is Shiva although a female icon may sometimes be portrayed with these attributes as Shiva&#x27;s consort, Parvati. Various depictions of Shiva exist: showing him naked (fully or partially), in activities such as slaying a demon (Andhaka) or dancing on the head of a slain elephant (Gajasura) and holding its skin up behind his back. He is often accompanied by his consort Parvati or shown with Nandi the bull. He may be represented as Bhairava, another of Shiva&#x27;s many manifestations.

A male figure depicted holding certain objects such as a conch (symbol of eternal, heavenly space) and a wheel (eternal time and destructive power) is Vishnu. If a female figure is depicted holding these objects, she is seen as his consort, Lakshmi. In all of the depictions Vishnu is holding four objects: a conch, a wheel, a lotus and a Kaumodaki (mace). These can be held in any of the icon&#x27;s hands, making possible twenty-four different forms of Vishnu, each with a unique name. Apart from these, Vishnu is depicted in any of his &quot;ten avataras&quot;, which include Vishnu sitting on Anantha (the celestial snake and keeper of life energy also known as Shesha), Vishnu with Lakshmi seated on his lap (Lakshminarayana), with the head of a lion disembowelling a demon on his lap (Lakshminarasimha), with head of a boar walking over a demon (Varaha), in the Krishna avatar (as Venugopala or the cow herder playing the Venu (flute), dancing on the head of the snake Kaliya, lifting a hill such as Govardhana), with his feet over head of a small figure (&quot;Vamana&quot;), along with Indra riding an elephant, with Lakshmi seated on Garuda, and the eagle (stealing the parijata tree).

==Temple complex==

The focus of a temple is the centre or sanctum sanctorum (garbhagriha) where the image of the deity resides, so temple architecture is designed to move the devotee from outside to the garbhagriha through ambulatory passageways for circumambulation and halls or chambers (&quot;mantapas&quot;) that become increasingly sacred as the deity is approached.
Hoysala temples have distinct parts that are merged to form a unified organic whole, in contrast to the temples of Tamil country where different parts of a temple stand independently. Although superficially unique, Hoysala temples resemble each other structurally. They are characterised by a complex profusion of sculpture decorating all the temple parts chiselled of soft soapstone (chloritic schist), a good material for intricate carving, executed mostly by local craftsmen, and exhibit architectural features that distinguish them from other temple architectures of South India.

Most Hoysala temples have a plain covered entrance porch supported by lathe turned (circular or bell-shaped) pillars which were sometimes further carved with deep fluting and moulded with decorative motifs. The temples may be built upon a platform raised by about a metre called a &quot;jagati&quot;. The &quot;jagati&quot;, apart from giving a raised look to the temple, serves as a &quot;pradakshinapatha&quot; or &quot;circumambulation path&quot; for circumambulation around the temple, as the &quot;garbagriha&quot; (inner sanctum) provides no such feature. Such temples will have an additional set of steps leading to an open &quot;mantapa&quot; (open hall) with parapet walls. A good example of this style is the Kesava Temple at Somanathapura. The &quot;jagati&quot; which is in unity with the rest of the temple follows a star-shaped design and the walls of the temple follow a zig-zag pattern, a Hoysala innovation.

Devotees can first complete a ritual circumambulation on the &quot;jagati&quot; starting from the main entrance by walking in a clockwise direction (towards the left) before entering the &quot;mantapa&quot;, following the sculptural clockwise-sequenced reliefs on the outer temple walls depicting a sequence of epic scenes from the Hindu epics. Temples that are not built on a &quot;jagati&quot; can have steps flanked by elephant balustrades (parapets) that lead to the &quot;mantapa&quot; from ground level. An example of a temple that does not exhibit the raised platform is the &quot;Bucesvara&quot; temple in Korvangla, Hassan District. In temples with two shrines (&quot;dvikuta&quot;), the &quot;vimanas&quot; (the shrines or cellae) may be placed either next to each other or on opposite sides. The Lakshmidevi temple at Doddagaddavalli is unique to Hoysala architecture as it has four shrines around a common centre and a fifth shrine within the same complex for the deity Bhairava (a form of Shiva). In addition, four minor shrines exist at each corner of the courtyard (&quot;prakaram&quot;).

==Architectural elements==

===Mantapa===
The &quot;mantapa&quot; is the hall where groups of people gather during prayers. The entrance to the &quot;mantapa&quot; normally has a highly ornate overhead lintel called a &quot;makaratorana&quot; (&quot;makara&quot; is an imaginary beast and &quot;torana&quot; is an overhead decoration). The open &quot;mantapa&quot; which serves the purpose of an outer hall (outer &quot;mantapa&quot;) is a regular feature in larger Hoysala temples leading to an inner small closed &quot;mantapa&quot; and the shrines. The open &quot;mantapas&quot; which are often spacious have seating areas (&quot;asana&quot;) made of stone with the &quot;mantapa&#x27;s&quot; parapet wall acting as a back rest. The seats may follow the same staggered square shape of the parapet wall. The ceiling here is supported by numerous pillars that create many bays. The shape of the open &quot;mantapa&quot; is best described as staggered-square and is the style used in most Hoysala temples. Even the smallest open &quot;mantapa&quot; has 13 bays. The walls have parapets that have half pillars supporting the outer ends of the roof which allow plenty of light making all the sculptural details visible. The &quot;mantapa&quot; ceiling is generally ornate with sculptures, both mythological and floral. The ceiling consists of deep and domical surfaces and contains sculptural depictions of banana bud motifs and other such decorations.

If the temple is small it will consist of only a closed &quot;mantapa&quot; (enclosed with walls extending all the way to the ceiling) and the shrine. The closed &quot;mantapa&quot;, well decorated inside and out, is larger than the vestibule connecting the shrine and the &quot;mantapa&quot; and has four lathe-turned pillars to support the ceiling, which may be deeply domed. The four pillars divide the hall into nine bays. The nine bays result in nine decorated ceilings. Pierced stone screens (&quot;Jali&quot; or Latticework) that serve as windows in the &quot;navaranga&quot; (hall) and &quot;Sabhamantapa&quot; (congregation hall) is a characteristic Hoysala stylistic element.

A porch adorns the entrance to a closed &quot;mantapa&quot;, consisting of an awning supported by two half-pillars (engaged columns) and two parapets, all richly decorated. The closed &quot;mantapa&quot; is connected to the shrines by a vestibule, a square area that also connects the shrines. Its outer walls are decorated, but as the size the vestibule is not large, this may not be a conspicuous part of the temple. The vestibule also has a short tower called the &quot;sukanasi&quot; or &quot;nose&quot; upon which is mounted the Hoysala emblem. In Belur and Halebidu, these sculptures are quite large and are placed at all doorways.

The outer and inner &quot;mantapa&quot; (open and closed) have circular lathe-turned pillars having four brackets at the top. Over each bracket stands sculptured figures called &quot;salabhanjika&quot; or &quot;madanika&quot;. The pillars may also exhibit ornamental carvings on the surface and no two pillars are alike. This is how Hoysala art differs from the work of their early overlords, the Western Chalukyas, who added sculptural details to the circular pillar base and left the top plain. The lathe-turned pillars are 16, 32, or 64-pointed; some are bell-shaped and have properties that reflect light. The Parsvanatha Basadi at Halebidu is a good example. According to Brown, the pillars with four monolithic brackets above them carry images of &quot;salabhanjikas&quot; and &quot;madanikas&quot; (sculpture of a woman, displaying stylised feminine features). This is a common feature of Chalukya-Hoysala temples. According to Sastri, the shape of the pillar and its capital, the base of which is square and whose shaft is a monolith that is lathe turned to render different shapes, is a &quot;remarkable feature&quot; of Hoysala art.

===Vimana===
The &quot;vimana&quot;, also called the cella, contains the most sacred shrine wherein resides the image of the presiding deity. The &quot;vimana&quot; is often topped by a tower which is quite different on the outside than on the inside. Inside, the vimana is plain and square, whereas outside it is profusely decorated and can be either stellate (&quot;star-shaped&quot;) or shaped as a staggered square, or feature a combination of these designs, giving it many projections and recesses that seem to multiply as the light falls on it. Each projection and recess has a complete decorative articulation that is rhythmic and repetitive and composed of blocks and mouldings, obscuring the tower profile. Depending on the number of shrines (and hence on the number of towers), the temples are classified as &quot;ekakuta&quot; (one), &quot;dvikuta&quot; (two), &quot;trikuta&quot; (three), &quot;chatushkuta&quot; (four) and &quot;panchakuta&quot; (five). Most Hoysala temples are &quot;ekakuta&quot;, &quot;dvikuta&quot; or &quot;trikuta&quot;, the Vaishnava ones mostly being &quot;trikuta&quot;. There are cases where a temple is &quot;trikuta&quot; but has only one tower over the main shrine (in the middle). So the terminology &quot;trikuta&quot; may not be literally accurate. In temples with multiple disconnected shrines, such as the twin temples at Mosale, all essential parts are duplicated for symmetry and balance.

The highest point of the temple (&quot;kalasa&quot;) has the shape of a water pot and stands on top of the tower. This portion of the &quot;vimana&quot; is often lost due to age and has been replaced with a metallic pinnacle. Below the &quot;kalasa&quot; is a large, highly- sculptured structure resembling a dome which is made from large stones and looks like a helmet. It may be 2 m by 2 m in size and follows the shape of the shrine. Below this structure are domed roofs in a square plan, all of them much smaller and crowned with small &quot;kalasas&quot;. They are mixed with other small roofs of different shapes and are ornately decorated. The tower of the shrine usually has three or four tiers of rows of decorative roofs while the tower on top of the &quot;sukanasi&quot; has one less tier, making the tower look like an extension of the main tower (Foekema calls it the &quot;nose&quot;). One decorated roof tier runs on top of the wall of a closed &quot;mantapa&quot; above the heavy eaves of an open &quot;mantapa&quot; and above the porches.

Below the superstructure of the &quot;vimana&quot; are temple &quot;eaves&quot; projecting half a meter from the wall. Below the eaves two different decorative schemes may be found, depending on whether a temple was built in the early or the later period of the empire. In the early temples built prior to the 13th century, there is one eave and below this are decorative miniature towers. A panel of Hindu deities and their attendants are below these towers, followed by a set of five different mouldings forming the base of the wall. In the later temples there is a second eave running about a metre below the upper eaves with decorative miniature towers placed between them. The wall images of gods are below the lower eaves, followed by six different mouldings of equal size. This is broadly termed &quot;horizontal treatment&quot;. The six mouldings at the base are divided in two sections. Going from the very base of the wall, the first horizontal layer contains a procession of elephants, above which are horsemen and then a band of foliage. The second horizontal section has depictions of the Hindu epics and &quot;Puranic&quot; scenes executed with detail. Above this are two friezes of &quot;yali&quot;s or &quot;makara&quot;s (imaginary beasts) and &quot;hamsas&quot; (swans). The &quot;vimana&quot; (tower) is divided into three horizontal sections and is even more ornate than the walls.

===Sculpture===

In Hoysala art Hardy identifies two conspicuous departures from the more austere Western (Later) Chalukya art:ornamental elaboration and a profusion of iconography with figure sculptures, both of which are found in abundance even on the superstructure over the shrine. Their medium, the soft chlorite schist (Soapstone) enabled a virtuoso carving style. Hoysala artists are noted for their attention to sculptural detail be it in the depiction of themes from the Hindu epics and deities or in their use of motifs such as &quot;yali&quot;, &quot;kirtimukha&quot; (gargoyles), aedicula (miniature decorative towers) on pilaster, &quot;makara&quot; (aquatic monster), birds (&quot;hamsa&quot;), spiral foliage, animals such as lions, elephants and horses, and even general aspects of daily life such as hair styles in vogue.

&quot;Salabhanjika&quot;, a common form of Hoysala sculpture, is an old Indian tradition going back to Buddhist sculpture. &quot;Sala&quot; is the sala tree and is the chaste maiden. In the Hoysala idiom, &quot;madanika&quot; figures are decorative objects put at an angle on the outer walls of the temple near the roof so that worshipers circumambulating the temple can view them.

The are pillar images that show traces of Chola art in the Chalukyan touches. Some of the artists working for the Hoysalas may have been from Chola country, a result of the expansion of the empire into Tamil-speaking regions of Southern India. The image of &quot;mohini&quot; on one of the pillars in the &quot;mantapa&quot; (closed hall) of the Chennakeshava temple is an example of Chola art.

General life themes are portrayed on wall panels such as the way horses were reined, the type of stirrup used, the depiction of dancers, musicians, instrumentalists, and rows of animals such as lions and elephants (where no two animals are identical). Perhaps no other temple in the country depicts the Ramayana and Mahabharata epics more effectively than the Hoysaleshwara temple at Halebidu.

Erotica was a subject the Hoysala artist handled with discretion. There is no exhibitionism in this, and erotic themes were carved into recesses and niches, generally miniature in form, making them inconspicuous. These erotic representations are associated with the &quot;Shakta&quot; practice.

Apart from these sculptures, entire sequences from the Hindu epics (commonly the Ramayana and the Mahabharata) have been sculpted in a clockwise direction starting at the main entrance. The right to left sequence is the same direction taken by the devotees in their ritual circumambulation as they wind inward toward the inner sanctum. Depictions from mythology such as the epic hero Arjuna shooting fish, the elephant-headed god Ganesha, the Sun god Surya, the weather and war god Indra, and Brahma with Sarasvati are common. Also frequently seen in these temples is Durga, with several arms holding weapons given to her by other gods, in the act of killing a buffalo (a demon in a buffalo&#x27;s form) and Harihara (a fusion of Shiva and Vishnu) holding a conch, wheel, and trident. Many of these friezes were signed by the artisans, the first known instance of signed artwork in India.

==Research==

According to Settar, surveys in modern times have indicated that 1000–1500 structures were built by the Hoysalas, of which about a hundred temples have survived to date. The Hoysala style is an offshoot of the Western Chalukya style, which was popular in the 10th and 11th centuries. It is distinctively Dravidian, and according to Brown, owing to its features, Hoysala architecture qualifies as an independent style. While the Hoysalas introduced innovative features into their architecture, they also borrowed features from earlier builders of &quot;Karnata&quot; like the Kadambas, Western Chalukyas. These features included the use of chloritic schist or soapstone as a basic building material.

Other features were the stepped style of &quot;vimana&quot; tower called the &quot;Kadamba shikhara&quot;, which was inherited from the Kadambas. Hoysala sculptors made use of the effect of light and shade on carved walls, which poses a challenge for photography of the temples. The artistry of the Hoysalas in stone has been compared to the finesse of an ivory worker or a goldsmith. The abundance of jewellery worn by the sculpted figures and the variety of hairstyles and headdresses depicted give a fair idea of the lifestyles of the Hoysala times.

==Notable craftsmen==

While medieval Indian artisans preferred to remain anonymous, Hoysala artisans signed their works, which has given researchers details about their lives, families, guilds, etc. Apart from the architects and sculptors, people of other guilds such as goldsmiths, ivory carvers, carpenters, and silversmiths also contributed to the completion of temples. The artisans were from diverse geographical backgrounds and included famous locals. Prolific architects included Amarashilpi Jakanachari, a native of Kaidala in Tumkur district, who also built temples for the Western Chalukyas. Ruvari Malithamma built the Kesava Temple at Somanathapura and worked on forty other monuments, including the Amruteshwara temple at Amruthapura. Malithamma specialised in ornamentation, and his works span six decades. His sculptures were typically signed in shorthand as &quot;Malli&quot; or simply &quot;Ma&quot;.

Dasoja and his son Chavana from Balligavi were the architects of Chennakesava Temple at Belur; Kedaroja was the chief architect of the Hoysaleswara Temple at Halebidu. Their influence is seen in other temples built by the Hoysalas as well. Names of other locals found in inscriptions are Maridamma, Baicoja, Caudaya, Nanjaya and Bama, Malloja, Nadoja, Siddoja, Masanithamma, Chameya and Rameya. Artists from Tamil country included Pallavachari and Cholavachari.

<doc id="37522" wikidata="Q466581" url="?curid=37522" title="Hoysala Kingdom">
<text>The Hoysala Kingdom was a Medieval Kingdom originating from the Indian subcontinent that ruled most of what is now Karnataka, parts of Tamilnadu and South-Western Telangana between the 10th and the 14th centuries CE. The capital of the Hoysalas was initially located at Belur, but was later moved to Halebidu.

The Hoysala rulers were originally from Malenadu, an elevated region in the Western Ghats. In the 12th century, taking advantage of the internecine warfare between the Western Chalukya Empire and Kalachuris of Kalyani, the Hoysalas annexed areas of present-day Karnataka and the fertile areas north of the Kaveri delta in present-day Tamil Nadu. By the 13th century, they governed most of Karnataka, north-western Tamil Nadu and parts of western Andhra Pradesh in the Deccan Plateau (Now Telangana).

The Hoysala era was an important period in the development of South Indian art, architecture, and religion. The Kingdom is remembered today primarily for Hoysala architecture; 100 surviving temples are scattered across Karnataka.

Well-known temples which exhibit what the historian Sailendra Sen has called &quot;an amazing display of sculptural exuberance&quot; include the Chennakeshava Temple in Belur, the Hoysaleswara Temple in Halebidu, and the Chennakesava Temple in Somanathapura. These three temples were inscribed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 2023. The Hoysala rulers also patronised the fine arts, encouraging literature to flourish in Kannada and Sanskrit.

==History==
=== Origins ===
Early inscriptions, dated 1078 and 1090, have implied that the Hoysalas were descendants of the Yadu by referring to the Yadava &quot;vamsa&quot; (or clan) as the &quot;Hoysala &quot;vamsa&quot;&quot;. But there are no early records directly linking the Hoysalas to the Yadavas of North India.
===Legendary beginnings===

Kannada folklore tells a legend of a young man, Sala (also known as Poysala), who saved his Jain guru Sudatta by killing a tiger (sometimes described as a lion) that they encountered whilst in a forest, near the temple of the goddess Vasantika at Angadi, now called Sosevuru. The word &quot;strike&quot; translates to &quot;hoy&quot; in Old Kannada, hence the name &#x27;Hoy-sala&#x27;. The legend purporting to show how Sala became the founder of the Hoysala dynasty is shown in the Belur inscription of the Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana, dated , but owing to several inconsistencies in the story it remains in the realm of folklore. Vishnuvardhana achieved a victory over the Cholas at Talakadu in 1116, and the legend may have arisen or gained popularity after this event, as the Hoysala emblem depicts Sala fighting a tiger, the tiger being the emblem of the Cholas.

===Establishment of the Kingdom===
The Hoysalas originated from the Western Ghats, mountains north-west of Gangavadi in Mysore. They emerged as borderland chiefs during the conflict between the Western Chalukya Empire and the Cholas, gaining power as they sided with the Chalukyas and were made provincial governors. After the authority of the Chalukyas declined, the Hoysalas managed to gain their independence. Under Vishnuvardhana, the Hoysalas achieved the status of a real Kingdom. He annexed Gangavadi and parts of Nolambavadi from the Cholas in 1116 and moved the capital from Belur to Dorasamudra (modern Halebidu), After taking Talakadu and Kolar in 1116, Vishnuvardhana assumed the title &quot;Talakadugonda&quot; in memory of his victory. Historians refer to the founders of the Hoysala dynasty as &quot;Maleparolganda&quot; (&#x27;Lord of the hills&#x27;), basing their evidence on inscriptions that describes them as being originally from Malenadu.

The earliest record of a member of the Hoysala dynasty is dated 950 and names Arekalla as the chieftain. Arekalla was succeeded in turn by Maruga and Nripa Kama I (976), and Munda (1006–1026). The next king, Nripa Kama I, had the title &quot;Permanadi&quot;, showing that an early alliance with the Western Ganga dynasty existed at the time of his reign.

Vishnuvardhana&#x27;s ambition of creating an independent Kingdom was fulfilled by his grandson Veera Ballala II, who freed the Hoysalas from domination by the Chalukya Empire during the first 20 years of his reign. He declared war against the Yadavas and defeated the Kadambas. He declared independence in 1193. During the establishment of the Hoysala Kingdom, the Deccan Plateau saw a four-way struggle for hegemony between four dynasties: the Hoysalas, the Pandyans, the Kakatiyas, and the Seunas. In 1217, Veera Ballala II defeated the aggressive Pandya after they invaded the Chola Kingdom, and helped to restore the Chola king.

===Increased influence and later eclipse===
The Hoysalas extended their foothold in modern-day Tamil Nadu around 1225, making the city of Kannanur Kuppam near Srirangam a provincial capital and taking control over the southern Deccan region. Vira Narasimha II&#x27;s son Vira Someshwara earned the honorific &quot;uncle&quot; (&quot;Mamadi&quot;) from the Pandyas and Cholas. From 1220 to 1245 the dynasty&#x27;s hegemony increased southwards to cover both the Chola and Pandya Kingdoms. Toward the end of the 13th century, Veera Ballala III recaptured territory in the Tamil country which had been lost during a Pandya uprising, thus uniting the northern and southern portions of the Kingdom.

In the early part of the 14th century, major political changes took place in the Deccan region during a period when large areas of northern India were under Muslim rule. Alauddin Khalji, the Sultan of Delhi, was determined to control southern India. In 1311 he sent his commander Malik Kafur on an expedition to plunder Devagiri, the capital city of the Seuna Kingdom By 1318 the Seuna Kingdom had been subjugated. The Hoysala capital Halebidu was besieged and sacked twice, in 1311 and 1327. By 1336, the Sultan had conquered the Pandyas of Madurai, the Kakatiyas of Warangal and the tiny Kingdom of Kampili. The Hoysalas were the only remaining Hindu Kingdom who resisted the invading armies. Veera Ballala III stationed himself at Tiruvannamalai and offered stiff resistance to invasions from the north and the Madurai Sultanate to the south. Then, after nearly three decades of resistance, Veera Ballala III was killed at the battle of Madurai in 1343, and the sovereign territories of the Hoysala Kingdom were merged with the areas administered by Harihara I in the Tungabhadra River region. This new Hindu Kingdom resisted the northern invasions and would later prosper and come to be known as the Vijayanagara Empire.

==Economy==
The empire consisted of the valleys of three main rivers, the Krishna, the Tungabhadra, and the Kaveri, whose systems facilitated the growth of crops and generated an agricultural output that was immense. The highlands (&quot;malnad&quot; regions) with its temperate climate was suitable for raising cattle and the planting of orchards and spices. Paddy and corn were staple crops in the tropical plains (&quot;Bailnad&quot;). As agricultural land was scarce, forests, waste land and previously unfarmed land was reclaimed, and new settlements were established. Large areas of forest were cleared to bring lands under cultivation and build villages. The Hoysala kings gave grants of land as rewards for service to the heads of families, who then became landlords (&quot;gavunda&quot;) to tenants who worked on the land and in the forests. The &quot;praja gavunda&quot; (&quot;the &quot;gavunda&quot; of the people&quot;) had a lower status than the wealthier &quot;prabhu gavunda&quot; (&quot;of the lord&quot;) 

The Hoysala administration supported itself through revenues from an agrarian economy. Land was assessed as being wet land, dry land or garden land for the purposes of taxation, and judged according to the quality of the soil. Taxes on commodities (gold, precious stones, perfumes, sandalwood, ropes, yarn, housing, hearths, shops, cattle pans, sugarcane presses) as well as produce (black pepper, betel leaves, ghee, paddy, spices, palm leaves, coconuts, sugar) are noted in village records. The Hoysalas encouraged people to move to newly-built villages by means of land grants and tax concessions.

Taxes, collected in the form of cash, from trade and commerce generated considerable wealth for the Hoysala state, and enabled it to buy armaments, elephants, horses and precious goods. The state and the merchant class became interdependent, with some more prosperous merchants being known as &quot;Rajasresthigal&quot; (royal merchants), officially recognised on account of their wealth. They were seen as &quot;puramulasthamba&quot; (&#x27;the pillars of the towns&#x27;). The increased prosperity and prestige of some merchants encouraged them to open markets and weekly fairs, with some becoming &quot;Pattanaswami&quot; (town administrators), who had the authority to collect tolls on goods that entered the town. Merchants engaged in minting activities, sometimes producing the coins and supplying them to the state.

Tanks (large reservoirs) were created at the expense of the state. The Hoysalas put resources into repairing breached tanks and broken sluices, easily damaged by heavy rainfall. They collected taxes on irrigation systems, canals and wells, all of which were built and maintained at the expense of local villagers. Repairs were undertaken by the landlords as well as their workers; such repairs were considered to be a duty and a pious act.

Importing horses for use as general transportation and in army cavalries of Indian Kingdoms was a flourishing business on the western seaboard. Song dynasty records from China mention the presence of Indian merchants in ports of South China, indicating active trade with overseas Kingdoms. South India exported textiles, spices, medicinal plants, precious stones, pottery, salt made from salt pans, jewels, gold, ivory, rhino horn, ebony, aloe wood, perfumes, sandalwood, camphor and condiments to China, Dhofar, Aden, and Siraf (the entryport to Egypt, Arabia and Persia).

==Administration==

In its administrative practices, the Hoysala Empire followed some of the well-established and proven methods of its predecessors covering administrative functions such as cabinet organisation and command, the structure of local governing bodies and the division of territory. Several of their major feudatories were Gavundas of the peasant extraction. Records show the names of many high-ranking positions reporting directly to the king. Senior ministers were called &quot;Pancha Pradhanas&quot;, ministers responsible for foreign affairs were designated &quot;Sandhivigrahi&quot; and the chief treasurer was &quot;Mahabhandari&quot; or &quot;Hiranyabhandari&quot;. &quot;Dandanayakas&quot; were in charge of armies and the chief justice of the Hoysala court was the &quot;Dharmadhikari&quot;.

The Kingdom was divided into provinces named &quot;Nadu&quot;, &quot;Vishaya&quot;, &quot;Kampana&quot; and &quot;Desha&quot;, listed in descending order of geographical size. Each province had a local governing body consisting of a minister (&quot;Mahapradhana&quot;) and a treasurer (&quot;Bhandari&quot;) that reported to the ruler of that province (&quot;Dandanayaka&quot;). Under this local ruler were officials called &quot;Heggaddes&quot; and &quot;Gavundas&quot; who hired and supervised the local farmers and labourers recruited to till the land. Subordinate ruling clans such as Alupas continued to govern their respective territories while following the policies set by the empire.

An elite and well-trained force of bodyguards known as &quot;Garudas&quot; protected the members of the royal family at all times. These servants moved closely yet inconspicuously by the side of their master, their loyalty being so complete that they committed suicide after his death. Hero stones (&quot;virgal&quot;) erected in memory of these bodyguards are called Garuda pillars. The Garuda pillar at the Hoysaleswara temple in Halebidu was erected in honor of Kuvara Lakshma, a minister and bodyguard of King Veera Ballala II.

King Vishnuvardhana&#x27;s coins had the legends &quot;victor at Nolambavadi&quot; (&quot;Nolambavadigonda&quot;), &quot;victor at Talakad&quot; (&quot;Talakadugonda&quot;), &quot;chief of the Malepas&quot; (&quot;Maleparolganda&quot;), &quot;Brave of Malepa&quot; (&quot;malapavira&quot;) in Hoysala style Kannada script. Their gold coin was called &quot;Honnu&quot; or &quot;Gadyana&quot; and weighed 62 grains of gold. &quot;Pana&quot; or &quot;Hana&quot; was a tenth of the &quot;Honnu&quot;, &quot;Haga&quot; was a fourth of the &quot;Pana&quot; and &quot;Visa&quot; was fourth of &quot;Haga&quot;. There were other coins called &quot;Bele&quot; and &quot;Kani&quot;.

===Capitals===
The first Hoysala capital was Sosavur (also called Sasakapura, Sosevuru, or Sosavurpattana), at present-day Angadi in Chikmagalur district. Sosavur was the Hoysala capital from 1026 to 1048. Even after the capital was moved, though, Sosavur remained an important commercial and administrative centre, as well as a Jain religious centre.

In 1048, the Hoysala capital was moved to Belur. Several factors made Belur an attractive site as a capital: first, its location on the Yagachi River provided a good supply of water year-round. Second, its location in hilly terrain made it easily defended. Third, it lay on an important trade route, helping both commerce and communications. However, Belur was barely capital for a decade before it was moved again.

The third and longest-lasting Hoysala capital was Dwarasamudra (also called Dorasamudra or Dvaravatipur), at the present-day site of Halebid. It became capital in 1062 and remained capital until the dynasty&#x27;s end. The reason for the shift is unknown, but it may have been for administrative convenience. Canals were dug connecting Dwarasamudra with Belur and bringing water from the Yagachi to Dwarasamudra. Two trade routes passed through the city, and scores of temples were built in it. The city declined in the 14th century.

==Culture==

===Religion===
The defeat of the Jain Western Gangas by the Cholas in the early 11th century and the rising numbers of followers of Vaishnavism and Lingayatism in the 12th century was mirrored by a decreased interest in Jainism. Two notable locations of Jain worship in the Hoysala territory were Shravanabelagola and Panchakuta Basadi, Kambadahalli. The decline of Buddhism in South India began in the eighth century with the spread of Adi Shankara&#x27;s Advaita Vedanta. The only places of Buddhist worship during the Hoysala time were at Dambal and Balligavi. Shantala Devi, queen of Vishnuvardhana, was a Jain but nevertheless commissioned the Hindu Kappe Chennigaraya temple in Belur, evidence that the royal family was tolerant of all religions.

During the rule of the Hoysalas, three important religious developments took place in present-day Karnataka inspired by three philosophers, Basava, Madhvacharya and Ramanuja.

While the origin of Lingayatism is debated, the movement grew through its association with Basava in the 12th century. Madhvacharya was critical of the teachings of Adi Shankara and argued the world is real and not an illusion. His Dvaita Vedanta gained popularity, enabling him to establish eight mathas in Udupi. Ramanuja, head of the Vaishnava monastery in Srirangam, preached the way of devotion (&quot;bhakti marga&quot;) and wrote the &quot;Sribhashya&quot;, a critique on Adi Shankara&#x27;s Advaita.

The effect of these religious developments on culture, literature, poetry and architecture in South India was profound. Important works of literature and poetry based on the teachings of these philosophers were written during the coming centuries. The Saluva, Tuluva and Aravidu dynasties of the Vijayanagara Empire were followers of Vaishnavism and a Vaishnava temple with an image of Ramanuja exists in the Vitthalapura area of Vijayanagara. Scholars in the later Kingdom of Mysore wrote Vaishnavite works upholding the teachings of Ramanuja. King Vishnuvardhana built many temples after his conversion from Jainism to Vaishnavism. The later saints of Madhvacharya&#x27;s order, Jayatirtha, Vyasatirtha, Sripadaraja, Vadiraja Tirtha and devotees (&quot;dasa&quot;) such as Vijaya Dasa, Gopaladasa and others from the Karnataka region spread his teachings far and wide. His teachings inspired later philosophers like Vallabha in Gujarat and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in Bengal. Another wave of devotion (&quot;bhakti&quot;) in the 17th and 18th centuries found inspiration in his Government of the Gupta Empire teachings.

===Society===
Hoysala society in many ways reflected the emerging religious, political and cultural developments of those times. During this period, the society became increasingly sophisticated. The status of women was varied. Some royal women were involved in administrative matters as shown in contemporary records describing Queen Umadevi&#x27;s administration of Halebidu in the absence of Veera Ballala II during his long military campaigns in northern territories. She also fought and defeated some antagonistic feudal rebels. Records describe the participation of women in the fine arts, such as Queen Shantala Devi&#x27;s skill in dance and music, and the 12th-century vachana sahitya poet and Lingayati mystic Akka Mahadevi&#x27;s devotion to the &quot;bhakti&quot; movement is well known. Temple dancers (&quot;Devadasi&quot;) were common and some were well educated and accomplished in the arts. These qualifications gave them more freedom than other urban and rural women who were restricted to daily mundane tasks. The practice of sati in a voluntary form was prevalent and prostitution was socially acceptable. As in most of India, a caste system was conspicuously present.

Trade on the west coast brought many foreigners to India including Arabs, Jews, Persians, Europeans, Chinese and people from the Malay Peninsula. Migration of people within Southern India as a result of the expansion of the empire produced an influx of new cultures and skills. In South India, towns were called &quot;Pattana&quot; or &quot;Pattanam&quot; and the marketplace, &quot;Nagara&quot; or &quot;Nagaram&quot;, the marketplace serving as the nuclei of a city. Some towns such as Shravanabelagola developed from a religious settlement in the 7th century to an important trading centre by the 12th century with the arrival of rich traders, while towns like Belur attained the atmosphere of a regal city when King Vishnuvardhana built the Chennakesava Temple there. Large temples supported by royal patronage served religious, social, and judiciary purposes, elevating the king to the level of &quot;God on earth&quot;.

Temple building served a commercial as well as a religious function and was not limited to any particular sect of Hinduism. Shaiva merchants of Halebidu financed the construction of the Hoysaleswara temple to compete with the Chennakesava temple built at Belur, elevating Halebidu to an important city as well. Hoysala temples however were secular and encouraged pilgrims of all Hindu sects, the Kesava temple at Somanathapura being an exception with strictly Vaishnava sculptural depictions. Temples built by rich landlords in rural areas fulfilled fiscal, political, cultural and religious needs of the agrarian communities. Irrespective of patronage, large temples served as establishments that provided employment to hundreds of people of various guilds and professions sustaining local communities as Hindu temples began to take on the shape of wealthy Buddhist monasteries.

===Literature===
Although Sanskrit literature remained popular during the Hoysala rule, royal patronage of local Kannada scholars increased. In the 12th century some works were written in the &quot;Champu&quot; style, but distinctive Kannada metres became more widely accepted. The &quot;Sangatya&quot; metre used in compositions, &quot;Shatpadi&quot; (six line), &quot;tripadi&quot; (three line) metres in verses and &quot;ragale&quot; (lyrical poems) became fashionable. Jain works continued to extol the virtues of Tirthankaras (Jain saviour figures).

The Hoysala court supported such notable poets as Janna, Rudrabhatta, Harihara and his nephew Raghavanka, whose works are enduring masterpieces in Kannada. In 1209, the Jain scholar Janna wrote &quot;Yashodharacharite&quot;, the story of a king who intends to perform a ritual sacrifice of two young boys to a local deity, Mariamma. Taking pity on the boys, the king releases them and gives up the practice of human sacrifice. In honour of this work, Janna received the title &quot;Emperor among poets&quot; (&quot;Kavichakravarthi&quot;) from King Veera Ballala II.

Rudrabhatta, a Smarta Brahmin, was the earliest well-known Brahminical writer. His patron was Chandramouli, a minister of King Veera Ballala II. Based on the earlier work &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; and other works with a similar theme, he wrote &quot;Jagannatha Vijaya&quot; in the &quot;Champu&quot; style relating the life of Krishna leading up to his fight with the demon Banasura. 

Harihara, (also known as Harisvara) a Lingayati writer and the patron of King Narasimha I, wrote the &quot;Girijakalyana&quot; in the old Jain &quot;Champu&quot; style which describes the marriage of Shiva and Parvati in ten sections. He was one of the earliest Virashaiva writers who was not part of the &quot;vachana&quot; literary tradition. He came from a family of accountants (&quot;Karanikas&quot;) from Halebidu and spent many years in Hampi writing more than one hundred &quot;ragales&quot; (poems in blank verse) in praise of Virupaksha (a form of Shiva). Raghavanka was the first to introduce the &quot;Shatpadi&quot; metre into Kannada literature in his &quot;Harishchandra kavya&quot; which is considered a classic even though it occasionally violates strict rules of Kannada grammar.

In Sanskrit, Madhvacharya wrote the &quot;Rigbhshya&quot; on the Brahma Sutras (a logical explanation of Hindu scriptures, the Vedas) as well as many polemical works rebutting the doctrines of other schools. He relied more on the Puranas than the Vedas for logical proof of his philosophy. Another famous writing was &quot;Rudraprshnabhashya&quot; by Vidyatirtha.

===Architecture===
The modern interest in the Hoysalas is due to their patronage of art and architecture rather than their military conquests. The brisk temple building throughout the Kingdom was accomplished despite constant threats from the Pandyas to the south and the Seunas Yadavas to the north. Their architectural style, an offshoot of the Western Chalukya style, shows distinct Dravidian influences. The Hoysala architecture style is described as &quot;Karnata Dravida&quot; as distinguished from the traditional &quot;Dravida&quot;, and is considered an independent architectural tradition with many unique features.

A feature of Hoysala temple architecture is its attention to exquisite detail and skilled craftsmanship. The tower over the temple shrine (&quot;vimana&quot;) is delicately finished with intricate carvings, showing attention to the ornate and elaborately detailed rather than to a tower form and height. The stellate design of the base of the shrine with its rhythmic projections and recesses is carried through the tower in an orderly succession of decorated tiers. Hoysala temple sculpture replicates this emphasis on delicacy and craftsmanship in its focus on depicting feminine beauty, grace and physique. The Hoysala artists achieved this with the use of Soapstone (Chloritic schist), a soft stone as basic building and sculptural material.

The Chennakesava Temple at Belur (1117), the Hoysaleswara Temple at Halebidu (1121), the Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura (1279), the temples at Arasikere (1220), Amruthapura (1196), Belavadi (1200), Nuggehalli (1246), Hosaholalu (1250), Aralaguppe (1250), Korvangla (1173), Haranhalli (1235), Mosale and Basaralu (1234) are some of the notable examples of Hoysala art. While the temples at Belur and Halebidu are the best known because of the beauty of their sculptures, the Hoysala art finds more complete expression in the smaller and lesser known temples. The outer walls of all these temples contain an intricate array of stone sculptures and horizontal friezes (decorative mouldings) that depict the Hindu epics. These depictions are generally clockwise in the traditional direction of circumambulation (&quot;pradakshina&quot;). The temple of Halebidu has been described as an outstanding example of Hindu architecture and an important milestone in Indian architecture. The temples of Belur and Halebidu are a proposed UNESCO world heritage sites.


===Language===
The support of the Hoysala rulers for the Kannada language was strong, and this is seen even in their epigraphs, often written in polished and poetic language, rather than prose, with illustrations of floral designs in the margins. According to historian Sheldon Pollock, the Hoysala era saw the complete displacement of Sanskrit, with Kannada dominating as the courtly language.

Temples served as local schools where learned Brahmins taught in Sanskrit, while Jain and Buddhist monasteries educated novice monks. Schools of higher learning were called &quot;Ghatikas&quot;. The local Kannada language was widely used in the rising number of devotional movements to express the ecstatic experience of closeness to the deity (&quot;vachanas&quot; and &quot;devaranama&quot;). Literary works were written in it on palm leaves which were tied together. While in past centuries Jain works had dominated Kannada literature, Shaiva and early Brahminical works became popular during the Hoysala reign.

Writings in Sanskrit included poetry, grammar, lexicon, manuals, rhetoric, commentaries on older works, prose fiction and drama. Inscriptions on stone (&quot;Shilashasana&quot;) and copper plates (&quot;Tamarashasana&quot;) were written mostly in Kannada but some were in Sanskrit or were bilingual. The sections of bilingual inscriptions stating the title, genealogy, origin myths of the king and benedictions were generally done in Sanskrit. Kannada was used to state terms of the grants, including information on the land, its boundaries, the participation of local authorities, rights and obligations of the grantee, taxes and dues, and witnesses. This ensured the content was clearly understood by the local people without ambiguity.

<text>Halebidu (IAST: Haḷēbīḍ, literally &quot;old capital, city, encampment&quot; or &quot;ruined city&quot;) is a town located in Hassan District, Karnataka, India. Historically known as Dwārasamudra (also Dorasamudra), Halebidu became the regal capital of the Hoysala Empire in the 11th century CE. In the modern era literature it is sometimes referred to as Halebeedu or Halebid as the phonetic equivalent, a local name after it was damaged and deserted after being ransacked and looted twice by the forces of the Turko-Persian Delhi Sultanate in the 14th century.

Halebidu is home to some of the best examples of Hindu and Jain temples with Hoysala architecture. These show the breadth of Hindu artwork traditions – Shiva, Vishnu, Devi and Vedic deities – fused into the same temple complex, depicted with a diversity of regional heritages, along with inscriptions in scripts from across India. The Hindu temples include Jaina reliefs in its panel. Similarly, the Jaina artwork includes the different Tirthankara as well as a Saraswati within its mantapa. Most notable among the Halebidu monuments are the ornate Hoysalesvara temple, Kedareshwara temple, Jaina Basadi temples, as well as the Hulikere step well (&quot;kalyani&quot;). These sites are within a kilometer of each other. The Hoysaleshwara Temple remains the only surviving monument in Halebidu.

==Location==
Halebidu is connected by road to Hassan on SH-21 (30 km), Mysore (150 km) and Mangalore on NH-73 (184 km). It is about 15 kilometers from Belur, another site known for its intricately carved Hoysala era temples.

==History==
Halebidu is in the midst of a valley east of the Western Ghats (Sahyadri Mountains un Karnataka). It is surrounded by low-lying mountains, boulders and seasonal rivers. This valley is well connected to northern Karnataka, western Andhra Pradesh and northern Tamil Nadu. Around this region, between the 10th and 14th-century, the Hoysaḷa dynasty came to power, whose history is unclear. By their own 11th and 12th-century inscriptions, they were descendants of the Krishna-Baladeva-roots and the Yadavas of Devagiri. They married into the Kalyana Chalukya Hindu dynasty, known for its temple and art tradition. The reliability of these inscriptions have been questioned as potential mythistory by some historians, who propose that the Hoysalas were a local Hindu family – a hill chief from the Sahyadri hill range of Karnataka remembered for having killed a tiger or a lion, and they seized and over time expanded their power starting in the 10th century.

Halebidu was built anew near a large reservoir by the early Hoysala kings, with support from their governors, merchants, and artisans. They greatly excavated and expanded the Dorasamudra reservoir. Major and spectacularly carved Hindu and Jain temples were already complete by the 12th century. Around the city were fort walls, generally tracing a rounded square-like area with an average span of 2.25 kilometers. Inside were four major water reservoirs and many smaller public water tanks. The city life, it major temples and the roads were centered near the Dorasamudra water reservoir. The city several dozen temples, of which only a small set has survived. Three set of temples – Hoysaleswara (twin temple), Jain Basadi (three temples) and Kedareshvara (one temple) – were the largest, more sophisticated in their architecture and artwork, while the rest were simpler.

To the immediate west of the major Hindu and Jain temples was the Hoysala Palace. This palace stretched south up to the &quot;Benne Gudda&quot; (&quot;lit.&quot;, butter hill). The palace is completely ruined and gone, with section lost in mounds and fragments found near the Benne Gudda. To the west of the palace was another group of Hindu and Jain temples – the Nagaresvara site, also destroyed whose ruins have been found in mounds. To the north of the original Hoysala city was a Saraswati temple and a Krishna temple, both also ruined and mostly lost. Towards the center and south of the old city were Hucesvara temple and a Rudresvara temple, evidenced by inscriptions and ruins that have been discovered. Four temples in northeastern section have survived – Gudlesvara, Virabhadra, Kumbalesvara and Ranganatha. The western part of the fortified section and beyond the fort were the historic farms that fed the population of the Dorasamudra capital. Roads connected the Hoysala capital to other major towns and pilgrimage sites such as Belur and Pushpagiri. Numerous inscriptions dating between mid 10th-century to early 13th-century attest to the importance of Dorasamudra to various Hoysala kings.

After the first invasion and destruction of Dorasamudra in the 14th century, inscriptions suggest that there were attempts to repair the temples, palace and infrastructure in Dorasamudra. As a condition to an end to the invasion, Malik Kafur of Turko-Persian Delhi Sultanate demanded the monarch Veera Ballala III to accept suzerainty of Khalji, pay tribute and provide logistical support to the Sultanate forces seeking to raid and loot the fabled wealth in the Pandya capital of Madurai in Tamil Nadu. Additional waves of wars of destruction and loot from the Turko-Persian Sultanates ended the Hoysala kingdom and Dorasamudra&#x27;s prosperity as a capital city. For nearly 300 years, Dorasamudra saw no new inscriptions or evidence of political or economic prosperity. A mid 17th-century Nayaka era inscription in Belur thereafter becomes the first to mention &quot;Halebidu&quot;. Meanwhile the surviving Hindu and Jain communities continued to support and repair the temples, with evidence of living temples in what is now the northern part of Halibidu.

<text>Shravanabelagola (pronunciation: ) is a town located near Channarayapatna of Hassan district in the Indian state of Karnataka and is from Bengaluru. The Gommateshwara Bahubali statue at Shravanabelagola is one of the most important tirthas (pilgrimage destinations) in Jainism, one that reached a peak in architectural and sculptural activity under the patronage of Western Ganga dynasty of Talakad. Chandragupta Maurya is said to have died on the hill of Chandragiri, which is located in Shravanabelagola, in 298 BCE after he became a Jain monk and assumed an ascetic life style.

Gommateshwara statue, Akkana Basadi, Chandragupta basadi, Chamundaraya Basadi, Parshvanath Basadi and inscriptions of Shravanabelagola group of monuments are listed as Adarsh Smarak Monument by  Archaeological Survey of India.

==Location==
Shravanabelagola is located at to the south-east of Channarayapatna in the Channarayapatna taluk of Hassan district of Karnataka. It is at a distance of south-east of Hassan, Karnataka, the district centre. It is situated at a distance of to the south from the Bengaluru-Mangaluru road (NH-75), from Hirisave, from Halebidu, from Belur, from Mysuru, from Bengaluru, the capital of Karnataka and from Mangaluru.

Sacred places are spread over two hills, Chandragiri and Vindyagiri, and also among the villages at the foothills.

==Etymology==

&quot;Shravanabelagola&quot; &quot;White Pond of the Shravana&quot; is named with reference to the colossal image of Gommaṭa - the prefix &quot;Śravaṇa&quot; serves to distinguish it from other Belagolas with the prefixes Hale- and Kodi-, while &quot;Beḷagoḷa&quot; &quot;white pond&quot; is an allusion to the pond in the middle of the town. The Sanskrit equivalents &quot;Śvetasarovara&quot;, &quot;Dhavalasarovara&quot; and &quot;Dhavalasarasa&quot; used in the inscriptions that support this meaning. There are more than 560 inscriptions in Shravabelagola.

Some inscriptions mention the name of the place as Beḷgoḷa, which has given rise to another derivation from the plant &quot;Solanum ferox&quot; (hairy-fruited eggplant). This derivation is in allusion to a tradition which says that a pious old woman completely anointed the colossal image with the milk brought by her in a &quot;gullakayi&quot; or eggplant. The place is also designated as &quot;Devara Beḷgoḷa&quot; &quot;White Pond of the God&quot; and &quot;Gommaṭapuram&quot; &quot;city of Gommaṭa&quot; in some epigraphs.

==History==

Shravanabelagola has two hills, Chandragiri and Vindhyagiri. &quot;Acharya&quot; Bhadrabahu and his pupil Chandragupta Maurya are believed to have meditated there. Chandragupta Basadi, which was dedicated to Chandragupta Maurya, was originally built there by Ashoka in the third century BCE. Chandragiri also has memorials to numerous monks and Śrāvakas who have meditated there since the fifth century CE, including the last king of the Rashtrakuta dynasty of Manyakheta. Chandragiri also has a famous temple built by Chavundaraya.

The 58-feet tall monolithic statue of Gommateshwara is located on Vindyagiri. It is considered to be the world&#x27;s largest monolithic statue. The base of the statue has an inscriptions in Prakrit, dating from 981 CE. The inscription praises the king who funded the effort and his general, Chavundaraya, who erected the statue for his mother. Every twelve years, thousands of devotees congregate here to perform the Mahamastakabhisheka, a spectacular ceremony in which the statue is anointed with Water, Turmeric, Rice flour, Sugar cane juice, Sandalwood paste, saffron, and gold and silver flowers. Recently Mahamastakabhisheka was held in 2018 during feb month. The next Mahamastakabhisheka will be held in 2030.

Shravanabelagola, nestled by the Vindhyagiri and Chandragiri Hills, protected by the monolith Bhagwan Bahubali, and home to over 2,300 years of Jain heritage, is a veritable picture postcard of our history and heritage spanning the centuries. In the town of Shravanabelagola, stands a colossal rock-cut statue of Gommateshwara Shri Bahubali. About eight hundred odd inscriptions which the Karnataka Archeological Department has collected at the place are mostly Jaina and cover a very extended period from 600 to 1830 CE. Some refer even to the remote time of Chandragupta Maurya and also relate the story of the first settlement of Jains at Shravanabelagola. That this village was an acknowledged seat of learning is proved from the fact that a priest from here named Akalanka was in 788 CE summoned to the court of Himasitala at Kanchi where having confuted the Buddhists in public disputation, he was instrumental in gaining their expulsion from the South of India to Ceylon.

==Inscriptions==
More than 800 inscriptions have been found at Shravanabelagola, dating to various times from 600 CE to 1830 CE. A large number of these are found in the Chandragiri and the rest can be seen in the Vindhyagiri Hill and the town. Most of the inscriptions at the Chandragiri date back before the 10th century. These inscriptions include texts in the Kannada. The second volume of Epigraphia Carnatica, written by B. Lewis Rice, is dedicated to the inscriptions found here. It is said to be the oldest Konkani inscription. The inscriptions are written in &quot;Purvahalagannada&quot; (Ancient Kannada) and &quot;Halegannada&quot; (Old Kannada) characters. Some of these inscriptions mention the rise and growth in power of the Western Ganga Dynasty, the Rashtrakutas, the Hoysala Empire, the Vijayanagara Empire and the Udaiyaar dynasty. These inscriptions have helped modern scholars to understand the nature and development of the Kannada language and its literature.

Tyagada Brahmadeva Pillar is a decorated freestanding pillar (&quot;lit&quot;, &quot;Stambha&quot;), tall, commissioned by Chamundaraya. The pillar dates to around 983 CE and exists on the Vindyagiri hill (called &quot;Dodda Betta&quot; in local Kannada language. On the base of the pillar, on the north side, is an inscription in old Kannada language of the same period.

The most famous of such consecrations is the anointment of the Bahubali Gommateshwara Statue located at Shravanabelagola. It is an important Jain festival held once in every 12 years. It is an integral part of the ancient and composite Jain tradition. The festival is held in veneration of a high monolithic statue of the Siddha Bahubali. The anointing last took place in February 2018, and the next ceremony is going to take place in 2030. During this festival, the statue is then bathed and anointed with libations such as milk, sugarcane juice, and saffron paste, and sprinkled with powders of sandalwood, turmeric, and vermilion.

The event has been attended by multiple political personalities including Krishna-Rajendra Wodeyar in 1910, Jawaharlal Nehru in 1951, Indira Gandhi in 1967 and 1981, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam in 2006, and Narendra Modi and Ramnath Kovind in 2018.

<text>433 Eros is a stony asteroid of the Amor group, and the first discovered, and second-largest near-Earth object. It has an elongated shape and a volume-equivalent diameter of approximately . Visited by the NEAR Shoemaker space probe in 1998, it became the first asteroid ever studied from its own orbit.

The asteroid was discovered by German astronomer C. G. Witt at the Berlin Observatory on 13 August 1898 in an eccentric orbit between Mars and Earth. It was later named after Eros, a god from Greek mythology, the son of Aphrodite. He is identified with the planet Venus.

==History==
===Discovery===
Eros was discovered on 13 August 1898 by Carl Gustav Witt at Berlin Urania Observatory and Auguste Charlois at Nice Observatory and temporarily labeled D.Q. Witt was taking a two-hour exposure of beta Aquarii to secure astrometric positions of asteroid 185 Eunike.

===Name===
Eros is named after the Greek god of love, Erōs. It was the first minor planet to be given a male name; the break with earlier tradition was made because it was the first near-Earth asteroid discovered.

===Later studies===
During the opposition of 1900–1901, a worldwide program was launched to make parallax measurements of Eros to determine the solar parallax (or distance to the Sun), with the results published in 1910 by Arthur Hinks of Cambridge and Charles D. Perrine of the Lick Observatory, University of California. Perrine published progress reports in 1906 and 1908. He took 965 photographs with the Crossley Reflector and selected 525 for measurement. A similar program was then carried out, during a closer approach, in 1930–1931 by Harold Spencer Jones. The value of the Astronomical Unit (roughly the Earth-Sun distance) obtained by this program was considered definitive until 1968, when radar and dynamical parallax methods started producing more precise measurements.

Eros was the first asteroid detected by the Arecibo Observatory&#x27;s radar system.

Eros was one of the first asteroids visited by a spacecraft, the first one orbited, and the first one soft-landed on. NASA spacecraft NEAR Shoemaker entered orbit around Eros in 2000, and landed in 2001.

===Mars-crosser===
Eros is a Mars-crosser asteroid, the first known to come within the orbit of Mars. Objects in such an orbit can remain there for only a few hundred million years before the orbit is perturbed by gravitational interactions. Dynamical system modeling suggests that Eros may evolve into an Earth-crosser within as short an interval as two million years, and has a roughly 50% chance of doing so over a time scale of ~ years. It is a potential Earth impactor, about five times larger than the impactor that created Chicxulub crater and led to the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs.

===&quot;NEAR Shoemaker&quot; survey and landing===
The NEAR Shoemaker probe visited Eros twice, first with a brief flyby in 1998, and then by orbiting it in 2000, when it extensively photographed its surface. On 12 February 2001, at the end of its mission, it landed on the asteroid&#x27;s surface using its maneuvering jets.

This was the first time a Near Earth asteroid was closely visited by a spacecraft.

==Physical characteristics==
Surface gravity depends on the distance from a spot on the surface to the center of a body&#x27;s mass. Eros&#x27;s surface gravity varies greatly because Eros is not a sphere but an elongated peanut-shaped object. The daytime temperature on Eros can reach about at perihelion. Nighttime measurements fall near . Eros&#x27;s density is 2.67 g/cm3, about the same as the density of Earth&#x27;s crust.

NEAR scientists have found that most of the larger rocks strewn across Eros were ejected from a single crater in an impact approximately 1 billion years ago. (The crater involved was proposed to be named &quot;Shoemaker&quot;, but is not recognized as such by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), and has been formally designated Charlois Regio.) This event may also be responsible for the 40 percent of the Erotian surface that is devoid of craters smaller than 0.5 kilometers across. It was originally thought that the debris thrown up by the collision filled in the smaller craters. An analysis of crater densities over the surface indicates that the areas with lower crater density are within 9 kilometers of the impact point. Some of the lower density areas were found on the opposite side of the asteroid but still within 9 kilometers.

It is thought that seismic shockwaves propagate through the asteroid, shaking smaller craters into rubble. Since Eros is irregularly shaped, parts of the surface antipodal to the point of impact can be within 9 kilometres of the impact point (measured in a straight line through the asteroid) even though some intervening parts of the surface are more than 9 kilometres away in straight-line distance. A suitable analogy would be the distance from the top centre of a bun to the bottom centre as compared to the distance from the top centre to a point on the bun&#x27;s circumference: top-to-bottom is a longer distance than top-to-periphery when measured along the surface but shorter than it in direct straight-line terms.
Compression from the same impact is believed to have created the thrust fault Hinks Dorsum.

A phenomenon named dust ponds were discovered in the asteroid in October 2000. Dust ponds are a phenomenon where pockets of dust are seen in airless celestial bodies. These are smooth deposits of dust accumulated in depressions on the surface of the body (like craters), contrasting from the rocky terrain around them. They typically have different color and albedo compared to the surrounding areas. The asteroid contains lots of large craters more than 200 m in diameter. Their number is near to the saturation point of these craters. But craters smaller than that are relatively low. Suggesting that some process of erasure has covered them up. The floors of some craters are covered with smooth and flat areas (less than 10° slope). Such dust ponds are characterized by slightly bluer colour compared to the surrounding terrain. 334 of such ponds are identified, with a diameter of 10m. 255 of these are larger than 30m, and 231 (or 91%) are found within 30° from equator. 

Data from the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous spacecraft collected on Eros in December 1998 suggests that it could contain 20 billion tonnes of aluminum and similar amounts of metals that are rare on Earth, such as gold and platinum.

==Visibility from Earth==

On 31 January 2012, Eros passed Earth at , about 70 times the distance to the Moon, with a visual magnitude of +8.1. During rare oppositions, every 81 years, such as in 1975 and 2056, Eros can reach a magnitude of +7.0, which is brighter than Neptune and brighter than any main-belt asteroid except 1 Ceres, 4 Vesta and, rarely, 2 Pallas and 7 Iris. Under this condition, the asteroid actually appears to stop, but unlike the normal condition for a body in heliocentric conjunction with Earth, its retrograde motion is very small. For example, in January and February 2137, it moves retrograde only 34 minutes in right ascension.

==In popular culture ==
In the novel and television series &quot;The Expanse&quot;, a catastrophic science experiment is unleashed on a civilian population living within tunnels cut through Eros. This so-called &quot;Eros Incident&quot; ends with the asteroid mysteriously breaking its usual orbit and crashing into Venus.

It makes an appearance in the novel (and its film adaptation) &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; by Orson Scott Card, serving as a base for humanity and the location of Command School after having been captured from the invading aliens (the Formics) prior to the initial novel who had used the asteroid as their forward operating base in their previous invasion.

In the &quot;Space Angel&quot; episode &#x27;Visitors from Outer Space&#x27; (title text not quite matching narration), Scott McCloud and his crew are forced to destroy Eros by deflecting it into the Sun, after it becomes a hazard to spacecraft navigation.

It is the setting for the entirety of the plot of the novel Captive Universe by Harry Harrison.

During Grant Morrison&#x27;s relaunch of the Justice League, Eros was used to imprison the General after attacking the Justice League.

<doc id="37527" wikidata="Q26921" url="?curid=37527" title="Alfa Romeo">
<text>Alfa Romeo Automobiles S.p.A. () is an Italian carmaker known for its sports-oriented vehicles, strong auto racing heritage, and iconic design. Headquartered in Turin, Italy, it is a subsidiary of Stellantis Europe and one of 14 brands of multinational automotive company Stellantis.

Founded on 24 June 1910 in Milan, Italy as A.L.F.A.—an acronym for &quot;Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili&quot;—the company was established by Cavaliere Ugo Stella to acquire the assets of the ailing Italian subsidiary of French carmaker Darracq, of which he had been an investor and manager. Its first car was the 24 HP, designed by Giuseppe Merosi, which became commercially successful and participated in the 1911 Targa Florio endurance race. In August 1915, ALFA was acquired by Neapolitan entrepreneur and engineer Nicola Romeo, who vastly expanded the company&#x27;s portfolio to include heavy machinery and aircraft engines. In 1920, the company&#x27;s name was changed to Alfa Romeo, with the Torpedo 20–30 HP being the first vehicle to bear the new brand.

Through the 1920s, Alfa Romeo produced several successful road and race cars, and was well represented in prominent European motorsport events, notably winning the inaugural Grand Prix in 1925. Nevertheless, the company soon faced financial troubles, leading to Romeo&#x27;s contentious departure in 1928 and Italian government ownership in 1933. Under the control of the industrial organization &quot;Institute per la Ricostruzione Industriale&quot; (IRI), Alfa Romeo initially continued making its signature custom luxury vehicles, but following the financial hardship of World War II, shifted to mass-producing small vehicles. In 1954, it launched the Giulietta series of family cars and developed the Alfa Romeo Twin Cam engine, which would remain in production until 1994.

Alfa Romeo became known for producing mass-market vehicles that nonetheless blended the aesthetics and performance of sport and luxury marques. Despite its strong brand image and relatively sizeable share of the high-performance auto market in Europe, by the 1970s, the company was operating at a loss, prompting IRI to sell it to Fiat Group in 1986. Alfa Romeo has since maintained its distinct identity and brand through several ownership changes, including Fiat&#x27;s merger with the American Chrysler Group in 2014, forming Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), and FCA&#x27;s subsequent merger in 2021 with the French PSA Group to form Stellantis.

Alfa Romeo is heavily involved in various motorsports—including Grand Prix motor racing, Formula One, sportscar racing, touring car racing, and rallies—with achievements giving a sporty image to the marque. Enzo Ferrari founded the Scuderia Ferrari racing team in 1929 as an Alfa Romeo racing team, before forming his namesake luxury sports car maker in 1939.

==History==
===Name===
The company&#x27;s name is a combination of the original name, &quot;A.L.F.A.&quot; (&quot;Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili&quot; - “Anonymous Lombardy Automobile Factory”), and the last name of entrepreneur Nicola Romeo, who took control of the company in 1915.

===Foundation and early years===


The first factory building of A.L.F.A. was in the first-place property of Società Anonima Italiana Darracq (SAID), founded in 1906 by the French automobile firm of Alexandre Darracq, with some Italian investors. One of them, Cavaliere Ugo Stella, an aristocrat from Milan, became chairman of the SAID in 1909. The firm&#x27;s initial location was in Naples, but even before the construction of the planned factory had started, Darracq decided late in 1906 that Milan would be more suitable and accordingly a tract of land was acquired in the Milan suburb of Portello, where a new factory of was constructed. In late 1909, the Italian Darracq cars were selling slowly and the company was wound up. Ugo Stella, with the other Italian co-investors, founded a new company named A.L.F.A. (Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili), buying the assets of Italian Darracq that was up to dissolution. The first car produced by the company was the 1910 24 HP, designed by Giuseppe Merosi, hired in 1909 for designing new cars more suited to the Italian market. Merosi would go on to design a series of new A.L.F.A. cars, with more powerful engines such as the 40–60 HP. A.L.F.A. ventured into motor racing, with drivers Franchini and Ronzoni competing in the 1911 Targa Florio with two 24-hp models. In 1914, an advanced Grand Prix car was designed and built, the GP1914, with a four-cylinder engine, double overhead camshafts, four valves per cylinder, and twin ignition. However, the onset of the First World War halted automobile production at A.L.F.A. for three years.

In August 1915, the company came under the direction of Neapolitan entrepreneur Nicola Romeo, who converted the factory to produce military hardware for the Italian and Allied war efforts. Munitions, aircraft engines and other components, compressors, and generators based on the company&#x27;s existing car engines were produced in a vastly enlarged factory during the war. After the war, Romeo invested his war profits in acquiring locomotive and railway carriage plants in Saronno (Costruzioni Meccaniche di Saronno), Rome (Officine Meccaniche di Roma), and Naples (Officine Ferroviarie Meridionali), which were added to his A.L.F.A. ownership.

Car production had not been considered at first, but resumed in 1919 since parts for the completion of 105 cars had remained at the A.L.F.A. factory since 1915. In 1920, the name of the company was changed to Alfa Romeo with the Torpedo 20–30 HP the first car to be so badged. Their first success came in 1920 when Giuseppe Campari won at Mugello and continued with second place in the Targa Florio driven by Enzo Ferrari. Giuseppe Merosi continued as head designer, and the company continued to produce solid road cars as well as successful race cars (including the 40–60 HP and the RL Targa Florio).

In 1923, Vittorio Jano was lured from Fiat, partly due to the persuasion of a young Alfa racing driver named Enzo Ferrari, to replace Merosi as chief designer at Alfa Romeo. The first Alfa Romeo under Jano was the P2 Grand Prix car, which won Alfa Romeo the inaugural world championship for Grand Prix cars in 1925. For road cars, Jano developed a series of small-to-medium-displacement 4-, 6-, and 8-cylinder inline engines based on the P2 unit that established the architecture of the company&#x27;s engines, with light alloy construction, hemispherical combustion chambers, centrally located plugs, two rows of overhead valves per cylinder bank and dual overhead cams. Jano&#x27;s designs proved both reliable and powerful.

Enzo Ferrari proved a better team manager than a driver, and when the factory team was privatised, it became Scuderia Ferrari. When Ferrari left Alfa Romeo, he went on to build his own cars. Tazio Nuvolari often drove for Alfa, winning many races before the Second World War.

In 1928, Nicola Romeo left, and in 1933 Alfa Romeo was rescued by the government, which then had effective control. Alfa Romeo became an instrument of Mussolini&#x27;s Italy, a national emblem. During this period, it built bespoke vehicles for the wealthy, with bodies normally by Carrozzeria Touring or Pininfarina. This era peaked with the Alfa Romeo 2900B Type 35 racers.

The Alfa factory (converted during wartime to the production of Macchi C.202 Folgore engines: the Daimler-Benz 600 series built under license) was bombed during the Second World War and struggled to return to profitability after the war. The luxury vehicles were out. Smaller, mass-produced vehicles began to be produced beginning with the 1954 model year, with the introduction of the Giulietta series of &quot;berline&quot; (saloons/sedans), coupes and open two-seaters. All three varieties shared what would become the Alfa Romeo overhead Twin Cam four-cylinder engine, initially displacing 1300 cc. This engine would eventually be enlarged to 2000 cc and would remain in production until 1995.

===Post war===
Once motorsports resumed after the Second World War, Alfa Romeo proved to be the car to beat in Grand Prix events. The introduction of the new formula (Formula One) for single seat racing cars provided an ideal setting for Alfa Romeo&#x27;s Tipo 158 Alfetta, adapted from a pre-war voiturette, and Giuseppe Farina won the first Formula One World Championship in 1950 in the 158. Juan Manuel Fangio secured Alfa&#x27;s second consecutive championship in 1951.

In 1952, Alfa Romeo experimented with its first front-wheel-drive compact car, &quot;Project 13–61&quot;. It had the same transverse-mounted, forward-motor layout as the modern front-wheel-drive automobile. Alfa Romeo made a second attempt in the late 1950s based on Project 13–61. It was to be called Tipo 103 and resembled the smaller version of its popular Alfa Romeo Giulia. However, due to the financial difficulties in post-war Italy, the Tipo 103 never saw production. Had Alfa Romeo produced it, it would have preceded the Mini as the first &quot;modern&quot; front-wheel-drive compact car. In the mid-1950s, Alfa Romeo entered into an agreement with Brazil&#x27;s Matarazzo Group to create a company called Fabral (&quot;Fábrica Brasileira de Automóveis Alfa&quot;, &quot;the Brazilian Alfa automobile factory&quot;) to build the Alfa Romeo 2000 there. After having received government approval, Matarazzo pulled out under pressure from Brazil&#x27;s President Juscelino Kubitschek with the state-owned FNM company instead commenced building the car as the &quot;FNM 2000&quot; there in 1960.

During the 1960s, Alfa Romeo concentrated on motorsports using production-based cars, including the GTA (standing for Gran Turismo Allegerita), an aluminium-bodied version of the Bertone-designed coupe with a powerful twin-plug engine. Among other victories, the GTA won the inaugural Sports Car Club of America&#x27;s Trans-Am championship in 1966. In the 1970s, Alfa Romeo concentrated on prototype sports car racing with the Tipo 33, with early victories in 1971. Eventually the Tipo 33TT12 gained the World Championship for Makes for Alfa Romeo in 1975 and the Tipo 33SC12 won the World Championship for Sports Cars in 1977.

As Alfa Romeo was a state-controlled company, they were often subject to political pressure. To help industrialize Italy&#x27;s underdeveloped south, Alfa Romeo&#x27;s new compact car was to be built at a new factory at Pomigliano d&#x27;Arco in Campania. Even the car&#x27;s name, &quot;Alfa Sud&quot; (Alfa South), reflected where it was built. 18 January 1968, saw a new company named &quot;Industria Napoletana Costruzioni Autoveicoli Alfa Romeo-Alfasud S.p.A.&quot; being formed, 90% of which belonged to Alfa Romeo and 10% to Government controlled holding company Finmeccanica. This plant was built in the wake of France&#x27;s 1968 protests and Italy&#x27;s Hot Autumn and was never &quot;properly started.&quot; The employees had mainly construction backgrounds and were not trained for factory work, while industrial relations were troublesome throughout. Absenteeism rates in the Pomigliano factory ran at 16.5 percent through the 1970s, reaching as high as 28 percent.

By the 1970s, Alfa Romeo was again in financial trouble, with the company running at about sixty percent of capacity in 1980. Since Alfa Romeo was controlled by the Italian government owned Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (IRI), a deal was made where about a quarter of worker&#x27;s salaries were paid through state unemployment agencies to allow Alfa&#x27;s plants to idle for two weeks every two months. An aging product lineup and very low productivity combined with near-permanent industrial unrest and Italy&#x27;s high inflation rates kept Alfa Romeo firmly in the red. Other creative measures were attempted to shore up Alfa, including an ultimately unsuccessful joint venture with Nissan endorsed by Alfa&#x27;s then-president, Ettore Massacesi, and Prime Minister Francesco Cossiga. By 1986, IRI was suffering heavy losses—with Alfa Romeo having not been profitable for the last 13 years—and IRI president Romano Prodi put Alfa Romeo up for sale. Finmeccanica, the mechanical holdings arm of IRI and its predecessors owned Alfa Romeo since 1932. Prodi first approached fellow Italian manufacturer Fiat, which offered to start a joint venture with Alfa.

===Fiat takeover===
Fiat withdrew its plan for a joint venture with Alfa Romeo when Ford put in an offer to acquire part of Alfa Romeo and restructure the company, while increasing its stake over time. However, Fiat chose to put in a bid to acquire the entirety of Alfa Romeo and offer job guarantees to Italian workers, an offer that Ford was unwilling to match. It also did not hurt any of the parties involved that an acquisition by Fiat would keep Alfa Romeo in Italian hands. In 1986, the deal was concluded with Alfa Romeo merged with traditional rival Lancia into Fiat&#x27;s Alfa Lancia Industriale S.p.A. Already in 1981, Alfa Romeo&#x27;s then-President Ettore Massacesi had stated that Alfa would never use Fiat engines—the engines being, to a large extent, Alfa Romeo&#x27;s identity—but would be happy to cooperate fully with everything else.

Models produced from the 1990 onwards combined Alfa&#x27;s traditional virtues of avant-garde styling and sporting panache with the economic benefits of product rationalisation, and include a &quot;GTA&quot; version of the 147 hatchback, the Giugiaro-designed Brera, and a high-performance exotic called the 8C Competizione (named after one of Alfa&#x27;s most successful prewar sports and racing cars, the 8C of the 1930s).

In 2005, Maserati was bought back from Ferrari and was now under Fiat&#x27;s full control. The Fiat Group then created a sports and luxury division from Maserati and Alfa Romeo. There is a planned strategic relationship between these two; engines, platforms and possibly dealers are shared.

In the beginning of 2007, Fiat Auto S.p.A. was reorganized and four new automobile companies were created; Fiat Automobiles S.p.A., Alfa Romeo Automobiles S.p.A., Lancia Automobiles S.p.A. and Fiat Light Commercial Vehicles S.p.A. These companies were fully owned by Fiat Group Automobiles S.p.A. (from 2007 FCA Italy S.p.A.).

On 24 June 2010, Alfa Romeo celebrated 100 years from its foundation.

===Recent developments===
Alfa Romeo has been suffering from falling sales. In 2010, it sold a total of about 112,000 units, which was significantly lower than Fiat CEO Marchionne&#x27;s global sales target of 300,000. The company set about to achieve a sales target of 170,000 units in 2011, including 100,000 Giulietta and 60,000 MiTo models, but it actually sold 130,000 units that year. Its medium-term target was 500,000 units by 2014 including 85,000 from the North American market. In 2017 Alfa Romeo increased production by 62 percent, building a total of 150,722 vehicles at the company&#x27;s three factories.

On 16 January 2021, the operations of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Groupe PSA were merged to form Stellantis and the company was renamed Stellantis Italy.

In spite of falling sales, Alfa Romeo CEO Jean-Philippe Imparato announced in 2021 that a new model would be launched every year between 2022 and 2026, starting with the much-delayed Tonale, with full electrification of new models from 2027.

===Return to North America===
Alfa Romeo was imported to the United States by Max Hoffman from the mid-1950s. The Giulietta Spider was developed on the request of Max Hoffman, who proposed an open top version of the Giulietta. In 1961 Alfa Romeo started exporting cars to the United States through its own dealer network.

In 1995, Alfa Romeo ceased exporting cars to the United States, the last model sold in that market being the 164 sedan.

On 5 May 2006, Alfa Romeo made its return to the US Market as announced by Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne after a series of rumours. North American sales resumed in October 2008, with the launch of the limited production 8C Competizione coupe with Alfa Romeo models being imported by Fiat&#x27;s US subsidiary Chrysler. Also in 2008, Alfa Romeo and Chrysler were reported to be in discussions over the possibility of producing Alfa Romeo cars in some Chrysler manufacturing plants that had shut down due to the company group&#x27;s restructure and cost cutting. Instead, as reported by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in November 2009, Chrysler discontinued several Dodge and Jeep models while phasing in Alfa Romeo ones and the new Fiat 500.

The next significant milestones in Alfa Romeo&#x27;s North American return occurred in 2014, with the launch of the more affordable two-seater 4C coupe. That year, Fiat Group Automobiles S.p.A. confirmed that its original agreement with Mazda Motor Corporation, for the speculated manufacturing of a new Alfa Romeo Spider based on the Mazda MX-5 had been terminated mutually in December 2014. The proposed model for this joint venture became the Fiat 124 Spider convertible launched in 2015. In 2015, Alfa Romeo&#x27;s return to this market was further bolstered by the automaker&#x27;s display of the new Giulia at the Los Angeles Auto Show. In February 2017, Chrysler featured its Alfa Romeo brand exclusively in three ads during Super Bowl LI.

Alfa Romeo&#x27;s US importer, FCA US LLC, imports the 4C, Giulia and Stelvio.

==Design and technology==
===Technological development===
Alfa Romeo has introduced many technological innovations over the years, and the company has often been among the first users of new technologies. Its trademark double overhead cam engine was used for the first time in the 1914 Grand Prix car, the first road car with such an engine, the 6C 1500 Sport, appeared in 1928.

Alfa Romeo tested one of the first electronic fuel injection systems (Caproni-Fuscaldo) in the Alfa Romeo 6C 2500 with &quot;Ala spessa&quot; body in 1940 Mille Miglia. The engine had six electrically operated injectors, fed by a semi-high pressure circulating fuel pump system.

1969 models for the North American market had SPICA (Società Pompe Iniezione Cassani &amp; Affini, a subsidiary of Alfa Romeo) mechanical fuel injection. According to Alfa Romeo, the engine&#x27;s power output and performance were unchanged from the carburetted version. The SPICA system continued until the 1982 model year with the introduction of 2.0 liter Bosch electronic fuel injection.

Mechanical variable valve timing was introduced in the Alfa Romeo Spider, sold in the U.S. in 1980. All Alfa Romeo Spider models from 1983 onward used electronic VVT.

The 105 series Giulia was quite an advanced car, using technologies such as all-wheel disc brakes, and a plastic radiator header tank. It had also the lowest drag coefficient (Cd) in its class The same trend continued with the Alfetta 2000 and GTV, which had quirks such as 50:50 weight distribution, standard fit alloy wheels and transaxle.

Newer innovations include complete CAD design process used in designing the Alfa Romeo 164 and an automated/paddle-shift transmission called &quot;Selespeed&quot; used in the 156; the 156 was also the world&#x27;s first passenger car to use Common rail diesel engine. The Multiair -an electro-hydraulic variable valve actuation technology used in MiTo was introduced in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the Alfa Romeo Giulia came with electrical brakes.

===Body design===
Many famous automotive design houses in Italy have accepted commissions to produce concepts and production vehicle shapes for Alfa Romeo. These include:
* Bertone
* Giorgetto Giugiaro / Italdesign
* Pininfarina
* Zagato
* Centro Stile Alfa Romeo

Construction techniques used by Alfa Romeo has been imitated by other carmakers, and in this way, the Alfa Romeo body designs have often been very influential. The following is a list of innovations, and where appropriate, examples of imitation by other car manufacturers:

* 1960s: Aerodynamics: The 116-series Giulia had a very low Cd. Toyota, in particular, sought to produce a similarly shaped series of vehicles at this time.
* 1970s: Fairing of bumpers: In order to meet American crash standards, Alfa Romeo formulated a design technique to incorporate bumpers into the overall bodywork design of vehicles so as to not ruin their design lines. The culmination of this design technique was the 1980s Alfa Romeo 75. The process was widely copied, particularly in Germany and Japan.
* 1980s: The Alfa Romeo 164: The design process and influence of this car is almost completely out of all proportion to previous Alfa Romeos. The 164 introduced complete CAD/CAM in the manufacturing cycle, with very little directly made by hand. In addition, the 164&#x27;s styling influence continues into the present-day line of modern Alfa Romeos. Most manufacturers incorporated design ideas first expressed in the 164 into their own designs, including greater reliance on on-board computers.
* 1990s: The pseudo-coupé: The Alfa Romeo 156 and 147, while four-door vehicles, represented themselves as two-doors with prominent front door handles, and less visible rear door-handle flaps. Honda has used this design style in the latest Civic hatchback, and a somewhat similar idea is also seen in the Mazda RX-8 four-seat coupé and Renault Clio V.
* 2000s: The Brera and 159: These vehicles&#x27; design, by Giorgetto Giugiaro, have proven influential in sedan and coupé styling, demonstrating that concept vehicles are often immediately translatable into road car form, providing that initial design takes place using CAD systems.

=== Concept cars ===
Several concept cars have been made by Alfa Romeo:

;1950s – The B.A.T. cars
The &quot;Berlina Aerodinamica Tecnica&quot; prototype cars were designed by Bertone as an exercise in determining whether streamlining and wind-tunnel driven designs would result in high performance on a standard chassis and whether the resulting vehicles would be palatable to the public. Alfa 1900 Sprint were the basis of the B.A.T. 5, 7 and 9.&lt;ref name=&quot;conceptcarz.com/vehicle&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The later B.A.T. 11 was based on the 8C Competizione.

;1960s and 1970s – Descendants of the Tipo 33
The Tipo 33 racing car, with its high-revving 2000 cc V8 engine became the basis for a number of different concept cars during the 1960s and 1970s, two of which ultimately resulted in production vehicles. Most made their appearances at the Auto Salon Genève. Here is a brief list:
* Gandini/Bertone Carabo (1968) – Marcello Gandini expressed ideas that would come to fruition in the Lamborghini Countach.
* Tipo 33.2 (1969) – Designed by Pininfarina using a design already known from a Ferrari concept car.
* Gandini/Bertone Montreal Concept (1967) – making its appearance at the 1967 Montreal Expo, this Giulia-based concept resulted in the production Alfa Romeo Montreal road car with a variant of the Tipo 33&#x27;s V8 engine.
* Bertone/Giugiaro Navajo (1976) – A fully fibreglassed vehicle, and in some ways the epitome of Giugiaro&#x27;s &#x27;Origami&#x27; style of flat planes.

;1980s-today – Modern ideas
In general, concept cars for Alfa Romeo have generally become production vehicles, after some modification to make them suitable for manufacture, and to provide driver and passenger safety. The Zagato SZ, GTV, and Spider, Brera, and 159 are all good examples of Alfa Romeo&#x27;s stylistic commitment in this direction.

==Logos==

===Original logo===
Alfa Romeo&#x27;s logo incorporates two heraldic devices traditionally associated with its birthplace, the city of Milan: A red cross, from the emblem of Milan, and the &quot;biscione&quot;, a big grass snake and a child emerging from its mouth—emblem of the House of Visconti, rulers of the city in the 14th century.

The logo was originally designed in 1910 by a young Italian draughtsman from the A.L.F.A. technical office, Romano Cattaneo.

====Origin====
In June 1910, the Società Anonima Darracq became Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili, and was readying its first model, the 24 HP. The board asked chief engineer Giuseppe Merosi to devise a badge for the radiator shell of the new car; Merosi turned to his collaborators. One of them, Cattaneo, was inspired by the coat of arms he had seen on the gates of Castello Sforzesco to include the &quot;biscione&quot; in the logo. Merosi liked the idea, and together with Cattaneo came up with a sketch, then approved by managing director Ugo Stella; Cattaneo was entrusted with doing the final design.

The original badge was round, of enamelled brass, measuring in diameter, and carried already all the present day accoutrements: the red cross on a white field of Milan on the left, a green &quot;biscione&quot; on a light blue field on the right, all surrounded by a blue ring inscribed with the words &quot;ALFA&quot; at the top and &quot;MILANO&quot; at the bottom. In honour of the King of Italy, the two words were separated by two figure-eight knots—named Savoy knots in Italian, and symbols of the then-reigning House of Savoy. Originally solid brass, the lettering was changed to white enamel in 1913. In 1918, after the company had been bought by Nicola Romeo, the wording &quot;ALFA&quot; was replaced with &quot;ALFA-ROMEO&quot;.

In 1925, to commemorate the victory of the Alfa Romeo P2 in the inaugural World Manufacturers&#x27; Championship of 1925, a silver metal laurel wreath was added around the badge, used (in varying form) until 1982. The addition of the wreath had enlarged the badge to diameter; in 1930 it was reduced back to .

====Post-war evolution====
In 1946, after the abolition of the monarchy and proclamation of the Italian Republic, the figure-eight knots of the Savoy were replaced with two curvy lines. Concurrently the badge was completely redesigned, and further reduced in size to , a diameter unchanged ever since. Made of stamped steel, the new badge bore the traditional elements—the scripts, the cross, a newly stylized &quot;biscione&quot; and a thin laurel wreath—embossed in antique silver, over a uniform Alfa Red background, which had replaced the blue, white and light blue fields. This red-and-metal badge was used until 1950, when the company switched back to a traditionally enamelled and coloured one; in 1960 the badge was changed from brass to plastic, without substantial differences in design.

At the beginning of the 1970s the all-new Alfa Romeo Pomigliano d&#x27;Arco plant (near Naples) was completed. When in 1972 the Alfasud produced there became the first Alfa Romeo passenger car manufactured outside Milan, the word &quot;Milano&quot;, the curved lines and the hyphen between &quot;Alfa&quot; and &quot;Romeo&quot; were eliminated from the badge on all Alfa Romeos. At the same time it was redesigned, most notably acquiring a modernised &quot;biscione&quot; and type face.

After a mild restyling in 1982, which deleted the wreath and changed lettering and all chrome details to gold, this iteration of the badge remained in use until 2015.

====2015 redesign====
On 24 June 2015, 105th anniversary of the company, a new logo was unveiled at a press event at the Alfa Romeo Museum; together with the Alfa Romeo Giulia as part of the brand&#x27;s relaunch plan. The redesign was carried out by Robilant Associati, who had previously reworked several other Fiat Group logos—including Fiat Automobiles&#x27; and Lancia&#x27;s.

The logo colors have been reduced from four to three: the green of the &quot;biscione&quot;, the red of the cross, and the dark blue of the surrounding ring. Other changes are a new serif type face, and the absence of the split white and light blue fields, replaced by a single silver textured background.

===The Quadrifoglio logo===
Since 1923, the &quot;quadrifoglio&quot; logo (also called the &#x27;cloverleaf&#x27;) has been the symbol of Alfa Romeo racing cars and since WWII, it has also been used to designate the higher trim models of the range. The &quot;quadrifoglio&quot; is usually placed on the side panels of the car, above or behind the front wheels—on the front wings in the case of modern vehicles. The logo consists of a green (or in some cases golden) cloverleaf with four leaves, contained with a white triangle.

====History of the emblem====

The &quot;quadrifoglio&quot; has been used on Alfa Romeo cars since the death of Ugo Sivocci in 1923. As a friend of Enzo Ferrari, Sivocci was hired by Alfa Romeo in 1920 to drive in the four-man works team—Alfa Corse—with Antonio Ascari, Giuseppe Campari, and Enzo Ferrari. Sivocci was thought to have enormous experience, but often hampered by bad luck and considered the eternal second-placer. To banish his bad luck, when the Targa Florio came around, the driver painted a white square with a green four-leaf clover (the &quot;quadrifoglio&quot;) in the centre of the grille of his car. Sivocci had immediate success, crossing the finish line first. The &quot;quadrifoglio&quot; subsequently became the symbol of the racing Alfa Romeos with the victory at the Targa Florio. Almost as if to prove the magic effects of this symbol, Sivocci was killed while testing Merosi&#x27;s new P1 at Monza, a few months after winning the Targa Florio. The Salerno driver&#x27;s P1, which went off the track on a bend, did not have the &quot;quadrifoglio&quot;. Since this period in 1923, the bodies of Alfa Romeo racing cars have been adorned with the &quot;quadrifoglio&quot; as a lucky charm. The white square was replaced with a triangle in memory of Ugo Sivocci.

====Modern usage====
The first road car to bear the &quot;quadrifoglio&quot; was the 1963 Alfa Romeo Giulia TI Super, a variant of the Giulia saloon car devised for competition but put regularly on sale; it had green four-leaf clovers on its front wings, without the triangle. In the 1970s &quot;Quadrifoglio Verde&quot; or &quot;Green Cloverleaf&quot; became the trim level for each model&#x27;s sportiest variant, equipped with the most powerful engine. The Alfasud, Sprint, 33, 75, 164 and 145 all had Quadrifoglio Verde versions. Also in the 1970s and through the 1980s golden four-leaf clover badges were used to denote the most luxurious and well-equipped variants of Alfa Romeo cars, named &quot;Quadrifoglio Oro&quot; or &quot;Gold Cloverleaf&quot;. The Alfasud, Alfetta, Alfa 6, 90 and 33 had Quadrifoglio Oro versions. In recent times the &quot;quadrifoglio&quot; was revived on the 2007 Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione and Spider sports cars. With the Alfa Romeo MiTo and Giulietta, the Quadrifoglio Verde was reinstated as the sportiest trim level in the range, and green four-leaf clovers on the front wings are once again the hallmark of high-performance Alfa Romeos. Alfa Romeo&#x27;s 2016 sport sedan, the all-new Giulia, was launched first in Quadrifoglio trim before the release of the base models.

==Motorsport==

Alfa Romeo has been involved with motor racing since 1911, when it entered two 24 HP models in Targa Florio competition. Alfa Romeo won the first World Manufacturers&#x27; Championship in 1925 and the first AIACR European Championship in 1931 and it scored wins at many races and motoring events such as Targa Florio, Mille Miglia and Le Mans. Great success continued with Formula One, when Alfa Romeo won the first World Formula One Championship in 1950 and won the second Formula One Championship in 1951. The company also won international championships in Prototypes, Touring and Fast Touring categories in the 1960s and 1970s. Private drivers also entered some rally competitions, with good results. Alfa Romeo has competed both as a constructor and an engine supplier, via works entries Alfa Corse, Autodelta and private entries. Alfa Romeo&#x27;s factory racing team was outsourced to Enzo Ferrari&#x27;s Scuderia Ferrari between 1933 and 1938. Drivers included Tazio Nuvolari, who won the 1935 German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring.

Alfa Romeo have been in a technical partnership with the Sauber F1 Team since 2018. In February 2019, Sauber announced that it would compete as Alfa Romeo Racing although the ownership, racing licence and management structure would remain unchanged. Alfa Romeo ended their partnership with Sauber and left Formula One after the 2023 season.

Alfa Romeo has won five FIA European Formula 3 Championships and five FIA European Formula 3 Cups with the support from the Alfa Romeo stable Euroracing, who created the motor for the Formula 3 championship and with the support of Italian motor company Novamotor which work in the Formula 3 competition.

==Production==

In the 1960s, the main Alfa Romeo factory was moved from inside Milan to a very large and nearby area extending over the municipalities of Arese, Lainate and Garbagnate Milanese. However, since then the factory was moved to Arese, as the offices and the main entrance of the area were located there.

In the late 1960s, a number of European automobile manufacturers established facilities in South Africa to assemble right hand drive vehicles. Fiat and other Italian manufacturers established factories along with these other manufacturers, Alfa-Romeos were assembled in Brits, outside Pretoria in the Transvaal Province of South Africa. With the imposition of sanctions by Western powers in the 1970s and 1980s, South Africa became self-sufficient, and in car production came to rely more and more on the products from local factories. This led to a set of circumstances where between 1972 and 1989, South Africa had the greatest number of Alfa Romeos on the road outside of Italy. The Alfa Romeos Brits plant was used from March 1983 until late 1985 to build Daihatsu Charades for local consumption, but also for export to Italy in order to skirt Italian limits on Japanese imports. For the last year the company was operating, the Daihatsu represented close to half of Alfa Romeo S.A. Ltd.&#x27;s total production.

In late 1985, with the impending Fiat takeover and an international boycott of the South African Apartheid government, Alfa Romeo withdrew from the market and closed the plant.

During the 1990s, Alfa Romeo moved car production to other districts in Italy. The Pomigliano d’Arco plant produced the 155, followed by the 145 and the 146, while the Arese plant manufactured the SZ and RZ sports cars, the 164, the new Spider and the GTV. The 156 was launched in 1997 and in 1998 was voted &quot;Car of the Year&quot;. The same year a new flagship, the 166 (assembled in Rivalta, near Turin) was launched. At the beginning of the third millennium, the 147 was released, which won the title of &quot;Car of the Year 2001&quot;. In 2003 the Arese factory was closed while only having some offices and the Alfa Romeo Historical Museum.

In the 1960s, Alfa Romeo became famous for models specifically designed for Italian police and Carabinieri (Italian national gendarmerie); among them the &quot;Giulia Super&quot; and the 2600 Sprint GT. The colours of the Alfa Romeos used by the police (Polizia) were/are green/blue with white stripes and writing, known as &quot;Pantera&quot; (Panthers). The Carabinieri Alfa Romeros are dark blue with white roofs and red stripes, known as the &quot;Gazzella&quot; (Gazelles), a nickname meant to denote the speed and agility of these &quot;Pattuglie&quot; (patrol cars). However, the term &quot;Pantera&quot; came to be used interchangeably to refer to both agencies&#x27; vehicles, and helped create a public perception of the cars as no-nonsense, determined and respected.

Since then, Alfa Romeos remain the chosen vehicle of the Carabinieri, Polizia Autostradale (highway police), Guardia di Finanza (fiscal law enforcement) and the conventional police service (Polizia). The following Alfa Romeo cars have/can be found in service with the Italian police and/or government.

:• Alfa Romeo AR51
:• Alfa Romeo Giulia
:• Alfa Romeo Alfetta
:• Alfa Romeo Giulietta
:• Alfa Romeo 33 (Polizia di Stato only)
:• Alfa Romeo 75
:• Alfa Romeo 164 (official vehicles)
:• Alfa Romeo 155
:• Alfa Romeo 156
:• Alfa Romeo 166 (official vehicles)
:• Alfa Romeo 159
:• Alfa Romeo Giulia (Carabinieri, 2 Giulia Quadrifoglio - Polizia di Stato, 2 Giulia Veloce Q4)

Since the 1960s, the Italian Prime Minister has used Alfa Romeos (and lately the new Maserati Quattroporte) as preferred government limousines. The 164 and 166 have found been particularly utilized in the last two decades.

===Trucks and light commercial vehicles===
In 1930, Alfa Romeo presented a light truck in addition to heavy LCVs based on Büssing constructions. In the Second World War Alfa Romeo also built trucks for the Italian army (&quot;35 tons anywhere&quot;) and later also for the German Wehrmacht. After the war, commercial motor vehicle production was resumed.

In co-operation with FIAT and Saviem starting from the 1960s different light truck models were developed.

The production of heavy LCVs in Italy was terminated in 1967. Heavy trucks continued to be built for a few years in Brazil by Alfa Romeo subsidiary Fábrica Nacional de Motores under the name FNM. The last Alfa Romeo vans were the Alfa Romeo AR6 and AR8, rebadged versions of Iveco Daily and Fiat Ducato. The company also produced trolleybuses for many systems in Italy, Latin America, Sweden, Greece, Germany, Turkey and South Africa. Later, Alfa Romeo concentrated only on passenger car manufacturing.

==Other production==
Although Alfa Romeo is best known as automobile manufacturer it has also produced commercial vehicles of various size, railway locomotives, tractors, buses, trams, compressors, generators, an electric cooker, marine and aircraft engines.

===Aircraft engines===

An Alfa engine was first used on an aircraft in 1910 on the Santoni-Franchini biplane. In 1932 Alfa Romeo built its first real aircraft engine, the D2 (240 bhp), fitted to Caproni 101 D2. In the 1930s when Alfa Romeo engines were used for aircraft on a larger scale; the Savoia Marchetti SM.74, Savoia-Marchetti SM.75, Savoia-Marchetti SM.79, Savoia Marchetti SM.81 and Cant Z506B Airone all used Alfa Romeo manufactured engines. In 1931, a competition was arranged where Tazio Nuvolari drove his Alfa Romeo 8C 3000 Monza against a Caproni Ca.100 airplane.

Alfa Romeo built various aircraft engines during the Second World War; the best known was the RA.1000 RC 41-I Monsone, a licensed version of the Daimler-Benz DB 601. This engine made it possible to build efficient fighter aircraft like the Macchi C.202 Folgore for the Italian army. After the Second World War Alfa Romeo produced engines for Fiat, Aerfer and Ambrosini. In the 1960s Alfa Romeo mainly focused upgrading and maintaining Curtiss-Wright, Pratt &amp; Whitney, Rolls-Royce and General Electric aircraft engines.

Alfa Romeo also built Italy&#x27;s first turbine engine, installed to the Beechcraft King Air. Alfa Romeo&#x27;s Avio division was sold to Aeritalia in 1988, from 1996 it was part of Fiat Avio. Alfa Avio was also part of developing team to the new T700-T6E1 engine to the NHI NH90 helicopter.

===Marine engines===

Alfa Romeo also produced marine engines. The first marine engine was produced in 1929. Later, for three consecutive years: 1937-1938-1939 with remarkable affirmations, Alfa Romeo demonstrated its constructive efficiency by contributing to the development of marine engines.

==Marketing and sponsorship==


During the years Alfa Romeo has been marketed with different slogans like: &quot;The family car that wins races&quot; used in the 1950s in Alfa Romeo 1900 marketing campaign, &quot;racing since 1911&quot; used on most 1960s Alfa advertisements. In the 1970s the Alfa Romeo 1750 GTV was marketed as &quot;if this kind of handling is good enough for our racing cars, it&#x27;s good enough for you.&quot; The Giulia Sprint GTA was marketed as &quot;The car you drive to work is a champion&quot;.
More recent slogans used are &quot;Mediocrity is a sin&quot;, &quot;Driven by Passion&quot;, &quot;Cuore Sportivo&quot;, &quot;Beauty is not enough&quot; and present day &quot;Without heart we would be mere machines&quot;. Also other more recent ones are: &quot;It&#x27;s not a car, it&#x27;s an Alfa Romeo.&quot;, one of them after a couple argue in Italian.

As part of its marketing policy, Alfa Romeo sponsors a number of sporting events, such as the Mille Miglia rally. It has sponsored the SBK Superbike World Championship and Ducati Corse since 2007, and the Goodwood Festival of Speed for many years, and was one of the featured brands in 2010 when Alfa Romeo celebrated its 100th anniversary.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/alfa_romeo&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Alfa Romeo Giulietta has been used since Monza 2010 race as the safety car in Superbike World Championship events. Alfa Romeo has been also shirt sponsor of Eintracht Frankfurt football club in period between 2013 and 2016.

In 2002, &quot;Alfa Romeo I&quot;, the first Alfa Romeo super maxi yacht was launched. It finished first in at least 74 races including the 2002 Sydney—Hobart Race. &quot;Alfa Romeo II&quot;, commissioned in 2005, measures LOA. It set a new elapsed-time record for monohulls in the 2009 Transpac race, of 5 days, 14 hours, 36 minutes, 20 seconds. It finished first in at least 140 races. In mid-2008 &quot;Alfa Romeo III&quot; was launched for competitive fleet racing under the IRC rule. &quot;Alfa Romeo III&quot; measures LOA and features interior design styled after the Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione.

The BBC motoring show &quot;Top Gear&quot; repeatedly argued the significance of owning an Alfa Romeo car as a car enthusiast, stating that &quot;You can&#x27;t be a true petrolhead if you have never owned/or wanted to own an Alfa Romeo&quot;. Presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May continuously praised Alfas for their beauty and driving characteristics even though Italian cars had a long-term bad reputation for unreliability. They argued that the owner build a personal relationship with the car despite all of its mechanical faults. Both Clarkson and May have previously owned Alfas (a GTV6 for Clarkson and an Alfa 164 for May) and both have stated that they regretted selling their Alfas the most.

As part of its U.S. relaunch, Alfa Romeo ran three commercials during Super Bowl LI; the brand was the sole marque advertised by FCA during the game, after exclusively focusing on its Jeep brand at Super Bowl 50.

In February 2013, Alfa Romeo sponsored University of St Andrews FS fashion show which saw luxury fashion designer Luke Archer and milliner George Jenkins win with their Alfa Romeo inspired garments.

Alfa Romeo announced Zhou Guanyu as China&#x27;s first Formula One racing driver for the 2022 season, hailed by both the team and the sport as a historic breakthrough in a key growth market.

<doc id="37529" wikidata="Q868531" url="?curid=37529" title="Commander Keen">
<text>Commander Keen is a series of side-scrolling platform video games developed primarily by id Software. The series consists of six main episodes, a &quot;lost&quot; episode, and a final game; all but the final game were released for MS-DOS in 1990 and 1991, while the 2001 &quot;Commander Keen&quot; was released for the Game Boy Color. The series follows the eponymous Commander Keen, the secret identity of the eight-year-old genius Billy Blaze, as he defends the Earth and the galaxy from alien threats with his homemade spaceship, rayguns, and pogo stick. 

The first three episodes were developed by Ideas from the Deep, the precursor to id, and published by Apogee Software as the shareware title &quot;Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons&quot;; the &quot;lost&quot; episode 3.5 &quot;Commander Keen in Keen Dreams&quot; was developed by id and published as a retail title by Softdisk; episodes four and five were released by Apogee as the shareware &quot;Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy&quot;; and the simultaneously developed episode six was published in retail by FormGen as &quot;Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter&quot;. Ten years later, an homage and sequel to the series was developed by David A. Palmer Productions and published by Activision as &quot;Commander Keen&quot;. Another game was announced in 2019 as under development by ZeniMax Online Studios, but was not released.

&quot;Invasion of the Vorticons&quot; was the only game developed by Ideas from the Deep, and was based on programmer John Carmack&#x27;s creation of adaptive tile refresh, a technique that allowed IBM-compatible general-purpose computers to replicate the smooth scrolling of video game consoles such as the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game&#x27;s success caused designer Tom Hall, programmers John Carmack and John Romero, and artist Adrian Carmack to found id Software. Their obligations to Softdisk, where they had worked during development of the game, led to the creation of &quot;Keen Dreams&quot; as a prototype for the second trilogy of episodes. The final episode was split off during development into a stand-alone retail title, and plans for a third trilogy were cancelled after the success of &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; (1992) and development focus on 3D first-person shooters such as &quot;Doom&quot; (1993). The final &quot;Keen&quot; game ten years later had oversight but little development work from id.

Critical reception and the series&#x27; legacy has focused on the two main trilogies of episodes, with &quot;Vorticons&quot; having large success as a shareware game and impacting the success of Apogee (now 3D Realms) and its shareware model. The second trilogy sold fewer copies, which was blamed by id and Apogee on its split into two parts, and the 2001 game received mixed reviews. The MS-DOS games have been re-released in several compilation packages, and all but the sixth episode are still sold through modern emulation releases on platforms such as Steam. References to the series have been made by dozens of other games, especially to the Dopefish, an enemy in the fourth episode, which has been termed one of the video game industry&#x27;s biggest in-jokes. An active modding community has grown around the series, producing editing tools and unofficial sequels.

==Titles==
===Games===
* Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons is the first game in the series, released on December 14, 1990, for MS-DOS. It is divided into three episodes: &quot;Marooned on Mars&quot;, &quot;The Earth Explodes&quot;, and &quot;Keen Must Die!&quot;, and the game was published through a shareware model whereby &quot;Marooned on Mars&quot; was released for free, and the other two episodes were available for purchase. It was developed by a team calling themselves Ideas from the Deep (or sometimes IFD Software), consisting of programmers John Carmack and John Romero, designer Tom Hall, artist Adrian Carmack, and manager Jay Wilbur, and published by Apogee Software. The game, like the rest of the series, is a side-scrolling platform video game.
* Commander Keen in Keen Dreams is the second game of the series, released in 1991 as a single episode; it is sometimes referred to as episode 3.5 of the series. It was developed for MS-DOS by id Software, which had been founded by the Ideas from the Deep team after the success of the first game, and published through Softdisk as part of an agreement between the companies as the founders of id had been employees of Softdisk when they developed &quot;Vorticons&quot;. Id used the game, which stands outside of the general continuity of the series as a &quot;dream&quot; episode, as a prototype to test ideas they wanted to use in future games, such as a more advanced art style, parallax scrolling, and gameplay changes. In 2013 a port was developed by Super Fighter Team for Android devices, and a 2014 Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign led to the original source code being released under GNU GPL-2.0-or-later and a release by Hard Disk Publishing through Steam for Microsoft Windows and Linux in 2015, and OS X in 2016. A Nintendo Switch version was released by Lone Wolf Technology in 2019.
* Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy was released for MS-DOS on December 15, 1991, as the second main game in the series. Consisting of episodes four and five of the series, &quot;Secret of the Oracle&quot; and &quot;The Armageddon Machine&quot;, and stylized as &quot;Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy!&quot;, it was developed by id and published through Apogee. Like the first trilogy of episodes, &quot;Secret of the Oracle&quot; was released for free, and the other episode sold by Apogee. The game incorporates a more polished version of the graphical updates in &quot;Keen Dreams&quot;, along with further gameplay changes and additions.
* Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter is the final id-developed game, released in December 1991 for MS-DOS. Originally planned to be the third episode of &quot;Goodbye, Galaxy&quot; and sixth episode overall, it was changed before development began to be a stand-alone game—stylized as &quot;Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter!&quot;—published as a retail title through FormGen. Due to differing timelines between FormGen and Apogee, despite being numbered as the sixth episode it was developed in between the fourth and fifth; it also features a modified engine from &quot;Goodbye, Galaxy&quot;.
* Commander Keen was released on May 29, 2001, for the Game Boy Color. Developed by David A. Palmer Productions and published by Activision, it was created as both a sequel and homage to the series as a whole, and does not have an episode number. Id was not a major partner in development, though it retained editorial control over the game, and Adrian Carmack contributed some artwork. The idea for a Game Boy Color &quot;Keen&quot; game came from John Carmack and id, who approached Activision, which in turn proposed Palmer as the developer.

===Cancelled and compilation releases===
After the release of &quot;Goodbye, Galaxy&quot; and &quot;Aliens Ate My Babysitter&quot; in 1991, id Software planned to make a third set of episodes for the following December, titled &quot;Commander Keen in The Universe is Toast!&quot;. Beyond the proposed title and release date, shown in the epilogue of the two games, no design work was completed before the game was cancelled due to the success of id&#x27;s &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; (1992) and development focus on 3D first-person shooters such as &quot;Doom&quot; (1993). John Carmack noted in 1999, when referencing the project that became the Game Boy Color game, that the original developers of &quot;Keen&quot; were unlikely to ever work together again on another game.

In 2019, at Bethesda&#x27;s E3 conference for iOS and Android devices held in June, a new game in the series was announced, again titled &quot;Commander Keen&quot;. Under development by ZeniMax Online Studios, the mobile game was said to include tactical strategy elements and have both single-player and multiplayer gameplay, and star Keen&#x27;s twin son and daughter, Billy and Billie. It was planned for release in the summer of the same year, but no release or further announcements were made, and all references to the game were removed from Bethesda and ZeniMax websites by June 2020.

In addition to the initial releases of the games, several compilation releases have been published: the &quot;id Anthology&quot; compilation in 1996, which includes all seven episodes developed by id or Ideas from the Deep; a compilation release by Apogee in 1998 of the five episodes of &quot;Invasion of the Vorticons&quot; and &quot;Goodbye, Galaxy&quot;; and the &quot;3D Realms Anthology&quot; in 2014, which also includes &quot;Vorticons&quot; and &quot;Galaxy&quot;. The Apogee-published episodes have also been released for modern computers through a DOS emulator, and sold through Steam since 2007 as the &quot;Commander Keen Complete Pack&quot;.

==Gameplay==

All of the games in the &quot;Commander Keen&quot; series are side-scrolling platform video games: the majority of the game features the player-controlled Commander Keen viewed from the side while moving on a two-dimensional plane. The player can move left and right and can jump; in every episode besides &quot;Keen Dreams&quot; they can also use a pogo stick to bounce continuously and jump higher than they can normally with the correct timing. The levels are composed of platforms on which Keen can stand, and some platforms allow Keen to jump up through them from below. Beginning with episode two, &quot;The Earth Explodes&quot;, there are also moving platforms as well as switches which extend bridges over gaps in the floor. &quot;Keen Dreams&quot; and later games add fireman&#x27;s poles that Keen can climb up or down, and with the exception of the 2001 &quot;Commander Keen&quot; also show the platforms viewed from slightly above so as to give a pseudo-3D effect. Throughout the series, once entered, the only way to exit a level is to reach the end, though for &quot;Keen Dreams&quot; and episodes four through six the player can save and return to the middle of a level, rather than only between levels like the other games. In between levels the player travels on a two-dimensional map, viewed from above; from the map the player can enter levels by approaching the entrance. Some levels are optional and can be bypassed, while others are secret and can only be reached by following specific procedures.

The episodes all contain a different set of enemies in their levels, which the player must kill, stun, or avoid. These enemies are typically aliens or robots. Levels can also include hazards, such as electricity or spikes; touching a hazard or most enemies causes Keen to lose a life, and the game is ended if all of Keen&#x27;s lives are lost. &quot;Invasion of the Vorticons&quot; features a raygun that Keen can use ammo for to kill enemies; &quot;Keen Dreams&quot; exchanges this for flower power pellets that temporarily stun enemies when thrown, episodes four through six use a stun gun that permanently stuns enemies, and the 2001 &quot;Commander Keen&quot; has a stun gun that temporarily stuns enemies unless they are then killed with a pogo jump. The player can also find food items throughout the levels which grant points, with an extra life awarded with enough points. There are also colored keycards which grant access to locked parts of levels, collectable items that award an extra life beginning with episode four, and items that grant an instant extra life.

==Plot==
In the first episode, &quot;Marooned on Mars&quot;, eight-year-old Billy Blaze, a child genius, builds a spaceship (the &quot;Beans with Bacon Megarocket&quot;) and puts on his older brother&#x27;s football helmet to become Commander Keen. One night while his parents are out of the house he flies to Mars to explore; while away from the ship the Vorticons steal four vital components and hide them in Martian cities. Keen journeys through Martian cities and outposts to find the components, despite the efforts of Martians and robots; the final component is guarded by a Vorticon. Keen returns to Earth—discovering a Vorticon mothership in orbit—and beats his parents home. In &quot;The Earth Explodes&quot; he travels through the mothership and disables its weapons, at the end discovering that the Vorticons are being mind-controlled by the mysterious Grand Intellect, who is actually behind the attack on Earth. In &quot;Keen Must Die&quot; he fights through the cities and outposts of the Vorticon home planet to reach the Grand Intellect, who is revealed to be his school rival Mortimer McMire, who he then defeats.

In &quot;Keen Dreams&quot;, which is set outside of the main continuity, Keen falls asleep after dinner and wakes up in his pajamas in bed on top of a hill. After being told by potato soldiers that he is now the slave of King Boobus Toober, and being asked by another child to save them, he journeys through the vegetable-themed land to defeat the King, waking up in his bed at home afterwards.

The main series of games continues in &quot;Secret of the Oracle&quot;, where Keen builds a faster-than-light radio and overhears plans by a race of aliens known as the Shikadi to destroy the galaxy. He flies off to the Oracle on the planet of Gnosticus IV, only to discover that the Gnosticenes that run the Oracle have been kidnapped by the Shikadi. Keen fights through the outposts and temples of the Shadowlands, rescuing the Gnosticenes, and the Oracle then tells Keen that the Shikadi are &quot;shadow beings from the far side of the galaxy&quot; who are building an Armageddon Machine at Korath III to blow up the galaxy and rebuild it as they wish afterwards.

In &quot;The Armageddon Machine&quot;, Keen infiltrates the titular space station to disable it, destroying the subsystems of the machine located in each level. When he finishes, he finds that the &quot;Gannalech&quot; that was leading the Shikadi was the Grand Intellect McMire, who had escaped Keen in &quot;Vorticons&quot; by leaving behind an android in his place. A note left behind for Keen tells him that McMire plans to instead destroy the Universe. &quot;Aliens Ate My Babysitter&quot; is set around the same time, though it is unclear whether it is actually after the events of &quot;Goodbye, Galaxy&quot;; in it, the alien Bloogs of Fribbulus Xax kidnap Keen&#x27;s babysitter and plan to eat her. Keen finds his way to her, and she reveals that she is McMire&#x27;s sister, and that McMire was behind her kidnapping as a way to distract Keen while he plotted to destroy the universe. While the planned trilogy that would cover that plot, &quot;The Universe is Toast&quot;, was never developed, the Game Boy Color &quot;Commander Keen&quot; has a sub-space anomaly disrupting life on Earth as an effect of a plot by the Bloogs, Shikadi, and Droidicus, led by McMire, to destroy the universe. Keen fights his way through the three races&#x27; planets to find the plasma crystals powering the Omegamatic station, only for McMire to escape after taunting Keen a final time.

===&quot;Invasion of the Vorticons&quot;===

In September 1990, John Carmack, a game programmer for the &quot;Gamer&#x27;s Edge&quot; video game subscription service and disk magazine at Softdisk in Shreveport, Louisiana, developed a way to create graphics which could smoothly scroll in any direction in a computer game. At the time, IBM-compatible general-purpose computers were not able to replicate the common feat of video game consoles such as the Nintendo Entertainment System, which were capable of redrawing the entire screen fast enough for a side-scrolling video game due to their specialized hardware. Carmack created adaptive tile refresh: a way to slide the majority of the visible screen to the side both horizontally and vertically when the player moved as if it had not changed, and only redraw the newly-visible portions of the screen. Other games had previously redrawn the whole screen in chunks, or like Carmack&#x27;s earlier games were limited to scrolling in one direction. He discussed the idea with coworker Tom Hall, who encouraged him to demonstrate it by recreating the first level of the recent &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; on a computer. The pair did so in a single overnight session, with Hall recreating the graphics of the game—replacing the player character of Mario with Dangerous Dave, a character from an eponymous previous Gamer&#x27;s Edge game—while Carmack optimized the code. The next morning on September 20, the resulting game, &quot;Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement&quot;, was shown to their other coworker John Romero. Romero recognized Carmack&#x27;s idea as a major accomplishment: Nintendo was one of the most successful companies in Japan, largely due to the success of their &quot;Mario&quot; franchise, and the ability to replicate the gameplay of the series on a computer could have large implications.

Romero felt that the potential of Carmack&#x27;s idea should not be &quot;wasted&quot; on Softdisk; while the other members of the Gamer&#x27;s Edge team more or less agreed, he especially felt that their talents in general were wasted on the company, which needed the money their games brought in but in his opinion neither understood nor appreciated video game design as distinct from general software programming. The manager of the team and fellow programmer, Jay Wilbur, recommended that they take the demo to Nintendo itself, to position themselves as capable of building a PC version of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; for the company. The group—composed of Carmack, Romero, Hall, and Wilbur, along with Lane Roathe, the editor for Gamer&#x27;s Edge, decided to build a full demo game for their idea to send to Nintendo. As they lacked the computers to build the project at home, and could not work on it at Softdisk, they &quot;borrowed&quot; their work computers over the weekend, taking them in their cars to a house shared by Carmack, Wilbur, and Roathe, and made a copy of the first level of the game over the next 72 hours. They credited the game to Ideas from the Deep, a name Romero had previously used for some Softdisk projects. The response from Nintendo a few weeks later was not as hoped for, however; while Nintendo was impressed with their efforts, they wanted the &quot;Mario&quot; series to remain exclusive to Nintendo consoles.

Around the same time as the group was rejected by Nintendo, Romero was approached by Scott Miller of Apogee Software, who wanted him to publish more levels for his previous &quot;Pyramids of Egypt—&quot;an adventure game where the player navigates mazes while avoiding Egyptian-themed traps and monsters—through Apogee&#x27;s shareware model. Miller was pioneering a model of game publishing where part of a game would be released for free, with the remainder of the game available for purchase from Apogee. Romero said he could not, as &quot;Pyramids of Egypt&quot; was owned by Softdisk, but that it did not matter as the game he was now working on was much better, and sent Miller the &quot;Mario&quot; demo. Miller was impressed, and the team agreed to create a new game for Apogee before Christmas of 1990—only a few months away—split into three parts to match Apogee&#x27;s shareware model of giving away the first part for free to attract interest in the whole. Hall suggested a console-style platformer in the vein of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, as they had the technology made for it; he further recommended a science fiction theme, and developed a short introduction that convinced the team to make &quot;Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons&quot;.

The Ideas from the Deep team could not afford to leave their jobs to work on the game full-time, so they continued to work at Softdisk, spending their time on the Gamer&#x27;s Edge games during the day and on &quot;Commander Keen&quot; at night and weekends using Softdisk computers. The group split into different roles: Hall became the game designer and creative director, John Carmack and Romero were the programmers, and Wilbur the manager. They invited artist Adrian Carmack from Softdisk to join them late in development, while Roathe was soon removed from the group. Ideas from the Deep spent nearly every waking moment when they were not working at Softdisk from October through December 1990 working on &quot;Commander Keen&quot;, with Wilbur forcing them to eat and take breaks.

The game&#x27;s design was largely driven by Tom Hall: Romero and especially John Carmack were focused almost exclusively on the programming; Wilbur was not involved in the game&#x27;s design; and Adrian Carmack joined late in development and found the project&#x27;s &quot;cute&quot; art style, till then mostly created by Hall, far-removed from his preferred, darker, style. Hall&#x27;s personal experiences and philosophies, therefore, strongly impacted the game: Keen&#x27;s red shoes and Green Bay Packers football helmet were items Hall wore as a child, dead enemies left behind corpses due to his belief that child players should be taught that death had permanent consequences, and enemies were based loosely on his reading of Sigmund Freud&#x27;s psychological theories, such as that of the id. Other influences on Hall for the game were &quot;Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century&quot; and other Chuck Jones cartoons, and &quot;The Available Data on the Worp Reaction&quot;, a short story about a child constructing a spaceship. Keen&#x27;s &quot;Bean-with-Bacon&quot; spaceship was taken from a George Carlin skit about using bay leaves as deodorant so as to smell like soup. Keen was intended to be a reflection of Hall as he had wanted to be as a child. The team separated the game from its &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; roots by adding non-linear exploration and additional mechanics like the pogo stick. A suggestion from Miller that part of the popularity of &quot;Super Mario Bros&quot; was the presence of secrets and hidden areas in the game led Hall to add several secrets, such as an entire hidden level in the first episode, and the &quot;Galactic Alphabet&quot;. The level maps were designed using a custom-made program called Tile Editor (TEd), which was first created for &quot;Dangerous Dave&quot; and was used for the entire &quot;Keen&quot; series as well as several other games.

As the game neared completion, Miller began to market the game to players. Strongly encouraged by the updates the team was sending him, he began heavily advertising the game in all of the bulletin board systems (BBS) and game magazines he had access to. The game was completed in early December 1990, and on the afternoon of December 14 Miller began uploading the completed first episode to BBSs, with the other two episodes listed as available for purchase as a mailed plastic bag with floppy disks for US$30 (~$ in ). After the arrival of the first royalty check from Apogee, the team planned to quit Softdisk and start their own company. When their boss and owner of Softdisk Al Vekovius confronted them on their plans, as well as their use of company resources to develop the game, the team made no secret of their intentions. Vekovius initially proposed a joint venture between the team and Softdisk, which fell apart when the other employees of the firm threatened to quit in response, and after a few weeks of negotiation the team agreed to produce a series of games for Gamer&#x27;s Edge, one every two months.

===1991 to present===
Ideas from the Deep, now founded as id Software, used some of these games to prototype ideas for their own games, including in late spring of 1991 &quot;Keen Dreams&quot;, which they used to develop new systems for their next set of major episodes of the series. They did not initially want to do a &quot;Keen&quot; game for Softdisk, but eventually decided that doing so would let them fulfill their obligations while also helping to improve the next full set of games for Apogee. The team reprised their roles from the first game, and prototyped an increase in graphical quality, a pseudo-3D view rather than a side-on view, ramps rather than solely flat surfaces, support for sound cards, and changes to the design based on player feedback. The game&#x27;s plot, as a result, was designed to be a standalone game outside of the continuity of the main series, and not a true sequel. Once the game engine and design changes were completed, &quot;Keen Dreams&quot; was completed in less than a month even as the team simultaneously worked on another game.

Beginning development in the June 1991, the team again reprised their roles for &quot;Goodbye, Galaxy&quot;. Hall had received feedback from parents who did not like that the enemies in &quot;Vorticons&quot; left behind corpses instead of disappearing like in other games; he did not want the violence to have no effects, and so in &quot;Dreams&quot; had replaced the raygun with pellets that temporarily stunned enemies. He was not satisfied with this change, and while considering ways to remove Keen&#x27;s parents during the introduction for &quot;Goodbye, Galaxy&quot;, came up with a stun gun which would leave behind permanently stunned enemies. Additionally, music, which was missing in prior &quot;Keen&quot; games, was added to &quot;Goodbye, Galaxy&quot;, composed by Bobby Prince. The game, episodes four though six, was intended to be published as a set named &quot;Goodbye, Galaxy&quot; in the same manner as the first one: released through Apogee, with episode four released for free in order to spur interest in purchasing the other two episodes. By August they had completed a beta version of episode four, &quot;Secret of the Oracle&quot;, and Romero sent it off to a fan he had met from Canada, Mark Rein, who had offered to play-test the game. Romero was impressed with the list of bugs that Rein sent back, as well as with his business sense, and proposed bringing him in to the company as a probationary president for six months in order to help expand their business. Within a few weeks of being hired, Rein made a deal to get id into the commercial market: to take the sixth episode and make it a stand-alone game, published as a retail title through FormGen instead of part of a shareware trilogy. Id signed the deal, but Scott Miller of Apogee was dismayed; he felt that not having a full trilogy for the shareware game would hurt sales.

Also in August 1991, the team moved from Shreveport to Hall&#x27;s hometown of Madison, Wisconsin, leaving behind Wilbur, who was unwilling to leave a stable job at Softdisk to fully join in with the startup, but picking up programmer Jason Blochowiak, who was working at the time at Softdisk. There, they worked on &quot;Goodbye, Galaxy&quot;, their remaining Softdisk games, and the now standalone &quot;Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter&quot; between August and December. Despite being listed numerically as the sixth episode, due to it having a different publisher and schedule &quot;Aliens Ate My Babysitter&quot; was developed after &quot;Secret of the Oracle&quot; but before &quot;The Armageddon Machine&quot;; the fifth episode, however, was created within one month. Another trilogy of episodes, titled &quot;The Universe Is Toast&quot;, was planned for December 1992; id worked on it for a couple of weeks, before shifting focus to &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; (1992). Hall proposed reviving the project after &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; was completed, but the team moved on to &quot;Doom&quot; (1993) instead. Id did not return to the series afterwards, instead continuing to focus on 3D first-person shooters.

In October 1999 during an online question and answer session, John Carmack, while discussing that the original founders of id Software were unlikely to ever work together on a game again, mentioned that he was considering the idea of making a &quot;Commander Keen&quot; game for the Game Boy Color handheld game console. Activision formally announced at the start of May 2001 that a new &quot;Commander Keen&quot; game had been developed by David A. Palmer Productions, and would be released at the end of the month. An interview the following week with founder David A. Palmer explained that the original idea for the game came from id, who approached Activision to produce it; Activision in turn recommended Palmer as the developer for the project as they had been attempting to get an agreement with id and Activision for several years for his studio to make a Game Boy Color version of several of their games. While Palmer was the developer for the game, id collaborated with the studio, with id having approval over game design elements and artist Adrian Carmack making some tile artwork for the game.

==Reception==
&quot;Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons&quot; was an immediate hit for Apogee: the company&#x27;s previous sales levels had been around US$7,000 per month, but by Christmas &quot;Keen&quot; already had sales of almost US$30,000. Miller described the game as &quot;a little atom bomb&quot; to magazine editors and BBS controllers when asked about it, and recruited his mother and hired his first employee to handle sales and phone calls from interested players. By June 1991, the game was bringing in over US$60,000 per month. Chris Parker of &quot;PC Magazine&quot; later in 1991 referred to the game&#x27;s release as a &quot;tremendous success&quot;. In 2009, Miller estimated the game&#x27;s lifetime sales as between 50,000 and 60,000 units. A contemporary review by Barry Simon of &quot;PC Magazine&quot; praised the game&#x27;s graphical capabilities as having a &quot;Nintendo feel&quot;, though he termed the graphics as &quot;well drawn&quot; but &quot;not spectacular&quot; in terms of resolution. He noted that the game was very much an arcade game that players would not purchase for &quot;its scintillating plot or ground-breaking originality&quot;, but said that all three episodes were very fun to play and that the scrolling graphics set it apart from similar games. A short summary of the trilogy in 1992 by &quot;PC World&quot; termed it &quot;one of the most spectacular games available&quot; and praised the &quot;superb&quot; sound and graphics, and a similar summary in &quot;CQ Amateur Radio&quot; described it as &quot;Nintendo comes to the PC&quot; and the &quot;best action/adventure game&quot; the reviewer had ever seen.

After its release in December 1991, &quot;Goodbye, Galaxy&quot; met with sales &quot;about a third&quot; of the original trilogy. Scott Miller of Apogee blamed the falling sales on the lack of a third episode, which he felt undercut the shareware model of the game. Tom Hall has also claimed that the split hurt the sales of the shareware episodes, though he has said that &quot;they still did decently, though&quot;. &quot;PC Zone&quot;, in its first issue in 1993, quoted shareware distributors as saying &quot;Goodbye, Galaxy&quot; was one of the top shareware sellers of 1992, behind &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;. IGN has also referred to the pair of episodes as &quot;Apogee&#x27;s hottest sellers&quot;. Hall has claimed &quot;The Armageddon Machine&quot; as the best &quot;Commander Keen&quot; episode and his favorite. &quot;Aliens Ate My Babysitter&quot; also did not sell as well as hoped for by id, which the team partially blamed on what they felt was terrible box art done by a company that had previously designed packaging for Lipton tea. Despite this, the sales were strong enough that id agreed to use FormGen as a retail publisher for at least two more games. &quot;PC Zone&quot; also stated that the sales of &quot;Aliens&quot; through shareware distributors was one of the highest in the shareware market in 1993.

In October 1992, the Shareware Industry Awards gave the &quot;Commander Keen&quot; series the &quot;Best Entertainment Software and Best Overall&quot; award. A review of the entire &quot;Commander Keen&quot; series in 1993 by Sandy Petersen in the first &quot;Eye of the Monitor&quot; column for &quot;Dragon&quot; described the series as action games with &quot;hilarious graphics&quot;. Acknowledging its debt to &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, he called it, especially &quot;Goodbye, Galaxy&quot;, &quot;one of the best games of its type&quot; and praised it for not being &quot;mindlessly hard&quot;, instead requiring some thought to play through, and especially for the humor in the graphics and gameplay. According to Steam Spy, as of June 2016 there are approximately 200,000 owners of the 2007 &quot;Commander Keen Complete Pack&quot; on Steam, and approximately 80,000 owners of the &quot;Keen Dreams&quot; release.

The 2001 &quot;Commander Keen&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. The graphics were both praised and criticized; reviewers praised the art style and the &quot;bright and colorful&quot; graphics, but disparaged the &quot;busy&quot; backgrounds and lackluster animations as making the game feel &quot;choppy&quot;, and complained that the graphical updates did not reflect the ten years since the last releases. The gameplay similarly received mixed opinions; reviewers were split between praising the difficult, &quot;old school&quot; gameplay as a successful adaptation of the originals and dismissing the &quot;aging&quot; gameplay as sound but not comparing well to more recent games. Reviewers concluded that the game was an &quot;acquired taste&quot; best suited for fans of the original series or younger players.

==Legacy==

Ideas from the Deep&#x27;s first royalty check from Apogee in January 1991 convinced them that they no longer needed their day jobs at Softdisk but could devote themselves full-time to their own ideas, leading to the founding of id Software in February. In the summer of 1991, id hosted a seminar for game developers with the intention of licensing the &quot;Commander Keen&quot; engine; they did so, forming the spiritual predecessor to both QuakeCon and id&#x27;s standard of licensing their game engines.

One of the enemies created for &quot;Secret of the Oracle&quot;, the Dopefish, has since the game&#x27;s release become one of the video game industry&#x27;s biggest in-jokes, making cameo appearances in other games. The Dopefish, which Hall describes as &quot;just a stupid green fish&quot;, is described in &quot;Secret of the Oracle&quot; as &quot;the second-dumbest creature in the universe&quot;. It has appeared in dozens of other games since its initial appearance, as references, images, or the phrase &quot;Dopefish Lives&quot;.
The Standard Galactic Alphabet, a writing system used to depict alien languages in the galaxy throughout the series, is used for textual signs and directions and was created by Tom Hall beginning with &quot;Invasion of the Vorticons&quot; as a way to pass hidden messages to players. It is a substitution cipher to the Latin alphabet, including the letters A–Z, opening and closing quotation marks, and a full stop. In 2019, it was added to the Under-ConScript Unicode Registry, using the codepoints to , and is included in the GNU Unifont CSUR extension. The Standard Galactic Alphabet also appears in the game &quot;Minecraft&quot; as the script and symbols used for its Enchanting Table.

In January 2018, John Romero and Tom Hall stated on Twitter that Billy Blaze is the grandson of &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; protagonist William &quot;B.J.&quot; Blazkowicz and the father of Doomguy from &quot;Doom&quot;. Commander Keen himself has appeared or has been referenced in many other video games over the years, including &quot;Doom II&quot;, &quot;Duke Nukem&quot;, &quot;Bio Menace&quot; and &quot;Doom&quot; (2016).

A number of fan-made &quot;Commander Keen&quot; games have been created since the publication of the original titles, with a fan website, the Public Commander Keen Forum, devoted to their creation, announcement, and discussion. Since the release of utilities to modify the levels and graphics in the original &quot;Keen&quot; series in 2002, more than fifty mods have been made, most of which feature Commander Keen as the protagonist. These mods include &quot;Commander Genius&quot;, an engine, released for multiple platforms, which interprets the episodes as a &quot;retro-evolved&quot; game, with re-polished graphics, a multiplayer compatibility, and a level editor, ports and remakes on different platforms, and &quot;The Universe Is Toast!&quot; mod, an unofficial sequel trilogy of games.

In January 2013, Tom Hall began development of &quot;Worlds of Wander&quot;, a tool for creating platform games, and the following month began a Kickstarter campaign for the tool and associated game, &quot;Secret Spaceship Club&quot;, which he described as a spiritual successor to &quot;Commander Keen&quot;. The project was unsuccessful in reaching its goal, though Hall said that he planned to continue working on it in his spare time.

<text>A tornado is a violently rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the Earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or, in rare cases, the base of a cumulus cloud. It is often referred to as a twister, whirlwind or cyclone, although the word cyclone is used in meteorology to name a weather system with a low-pressure area in the center around which, from an observer looking down toward the surface of the Earth, winds blow counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes, and they are often (but not always) visible in the form of a condensation funnel originating from the base of a cumulonimbus cloud, with a cloud of rotating debris and dust beneath it. Most tornadoes have wind speeds less than , are about across, and travel several kilometers (a few miles) before dissipating. The most extreme tornadoes can attain wind speeds of more than , can be more than in diameter, and can stay on the ground for more than .

Various types of tornadoes include the multiple-vortex tornado, landspout, and waterspout. Waterspouts are characterized by a spiraling funnel-shaped wind current, connecting to a large cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud. They are generally classified as non-supercellular tornadoes that develop over bodies of water, but there is disagreement over whether to classify them as true tornadoes. These spiraling columns of air frequently develop in tropical areas close to the equator and are less common at high latitudes. Other tornado-like phenomena that exist in nature include the gustnado, dust devil, fire whirl, and steam devil.

Tornadoes occur most frequently in North America (particularly in central and southeastern regions of the United States colloquially known as Tornado Alley; the United States has by far the most tornadoes of any country in the world). Tornadoes also occur in South Africa, much of Europe (except most of the Alps), western and eastern Australia, New Zealand, Bangladesh and adjacent eastern India, Japan, the Philippines, and southeastern South America (Uruguay and Argentina). Tornadoes can be detected before or as they occur through the use of pulse-Doppler radar by recognizing patterns in velocity and reflectivity data, such as hook echoes or debris balls, as well as through the efforts of storm spotters.

== Tornado rating scales ==

There are several scales for rating the strength of tornadoes. The Fujita scale rates tornadoes by damage caused and has been replaced in some countries by the updated Enhanced Fujita Scale. An F0 or EF0 tornado, the weakest category, damages trees, but not substantial structures. An F5 or EF5 tornado, the strongest category, rips buildings off their foundations and can deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. The International Fujita scale is also used to rate the intensity of tornadoes and other wind events based on the severity of the damage they cause. Doppler radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (trochoidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and assign a rating.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;tornado&quot; comes from the Spanish (meaning &#x27;thunderstorm&#x27;, past participle of &quot;tronar&quot; &#x27;to thunder&#x27;, itself in turn from the Latin &quot;tonāre&quot; &#x27;to thunder&#x27;). The metathesis of the r and o in the English spelling was influenced by the Spanish &quot;tornado&quot; (past participle of &quot;tornar&quot; &#x27;to twist, turn,&#x27;, from Latin &quot;tornō&quot; &#x27;to turn&#x27;). The English word has been reborrowed into Spanish, referring to the same weather phenomenon.

Tornadoes&#x27; opposite phenomena are the widespread, straight-line derechos (, from , &#x27;straight&#x27;). A tornado is also commonly referred to as a &quot;twister&quot; or the old-fashioned colloquial term &quot;cyclone&quot;.

== Definitions ==
A tornado is a violently rotating column of air, in contact with the ground, either pendant from a cumuliform cloud or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a funnel cloud. For a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with both the ground and the cloud base. The term is not precisely defined; for example, there is disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes. &quot;Tornado&quot; refers to the vortex of wind, not the condensation cloud.

=== Funnel cloud ===
A tornado is not necessarily visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (as described by Bernoulli&#x27;s principle) and rapid rotation (due to cyclostrophic balance) usually cause water vapor in the air to condense into cloud droplets due to adiabatic cooling. This results in the formation of a visible funnel cloud or condensation funnel.

There is some disagreement over the definition of a funnel cloud and a condensation funnel. According to the &quot;Glossary of Meteorology&quot;, a funnel cloud is any rotating cloud pendant from a cumulus or cumulonimbus, and thus most tornadoes are included under this definition. Among many meteorologists, the &quot;funnel cloud&quot; term is strictly defined as a rotating cloud which is not associated with strong winds at the surface, and condensation funnel is a broad term for any rotating cloud below a cumuliform cloud.

Tornadoes often begin as funnel clouds with no associated strong winds at the surface, and not all funnel clouds evolve into tornadoes. Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground, so it is difficult to discern the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado from a distance.

===Outbreaks and families===

Occasionally, a single storm will produce more than one tornado, either simultaneously or in succession. Multiple tornadoes produced by the same storm cell are referred to as a &quot;tornado family&quot;. Several tornadoes are sometimes spawned from the same large-scale storm system. If there is no break in activity, this is considered a tornado outbreak (although the term &quot;tornado outbreak&quot; has various definitions). A period of several successive days with tornado outbreaks in the same general area (spawned by multiple weather systems) is a tornado outbreak sequence, occasionally called an extended tornado outbreak.

== Characteristics ==

=== Size and shape ===
Most tornadoes take on the appearance of a narrow funnel, a few hundred meters (yards) across, with a small cloud of debris near the ground. Tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not see them.

Small, relatively weak landspouts may be visible only as a small swirl of dust on the ground. Although the condensation funnel may not extend all the way to the ground, if associated surface winds are greater than , the circulation is considered a tornado. A tornado with a nearly cylindrical profile and relatively low height is sometimes referred to as a &quot;stovepipe&quot; tornado. Large tornadoes which appear wider than their cloud-to-ground height can look like large wedges stuck into the ground, and so are known as &quot;wedge tornadoes&quot; or &quot;wedges&quot;. The &quot;stovepipe&quot; classification is also used for this type of tornado if it otherwise fits that profile. A wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds, wider than the distance from the cloud base to the ground. Even experienced storm observers may not be able to tell the difference between a low-hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance. Many, but not all major tornadoes are wedges.

Tornadoes in the dissipating stage can resemble narrow tubes or ropes, and often curl or twist into complex shapes. These tornadoes are said to be &quot;roping out&quot;, or becoming a &quot;rope tornado&quot;. When they rope out, the length of their funnel increases, which forces the winds within the funnel to weaken due to conservation of angular momentum. Multiple-vortex tornadoes can appear as a family of swirls circling a common center, or they may be completely obscured by condensation, dust, and debris, appearing to be a single funnel.

In the United States, tornadoes are around across on average. However, there is a wide range of tornado sizes. Weak tornadoes, or strong yet dissipating tornadoes, can be exceedingly narrow, sometimes only a few feet or couple meters across. One tornado was reported to have a damage path only long. On the other end of the spectrum, wedge tornadoes can have a damage path a mile (1.6 km) wide or more. A tornado that affected Hallam, Nebraska on May 22, 2004, was up to wide at the ground, and a tornado in El Reno, Oklahoma on May 31, 2013, was approximately wide, the widest on record.

=== Track length ===
In the United States, the average tornado travels on the ground for . However, tornadoes are capable of both much shorter and much longer damage paths: one tornado was reported to have a damage path only long, while the record-holding tornado for path length—the Tri-State Tornado, which affected parts of Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana on March 18, 1925—was on the ground continuously for . Many tornadoes which appear to have path lengths of or longer are composed of a family of tornadoes which have formed in quick succession; however, there is no substantial evidence that this occurred in the case of the Tri-State Tornado. A 2007 reanalysis of the path suggests that the tornado may have begun further west than previously thought.

===Appearance===
Tornadoes can have a wide range of colors, depending on the environment in which they form. Those that form in dry environments can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris at the base of the funnel. Condensation funnels that pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While traveling over a body of water (as a waterspout), tornadoes can turn white or even blue. Slow-moving funnels, which ingest a considerable amount of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris. Tornadoes in the Great Plains can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning white.

Lighting conditions are a major factor in the appearance of a tornado. A tornado which is &quot;back-lit&quot; (viewed with the sun behind it) appears very dark. The same tornado, viewed with the sun at the observer&#x27;s back, may appear gray or brilliant white. Tornadoes which occur near the time of sunset can be many different colors, appearing in hues of yellow, orange, and pink.

Dust kicked up by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the darkness of night are all factors that can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only weather radar observations, or possibly the sound of an approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm&#x27;s path. Most significant tornadoes form under the storm&#x27;s &quot;updraft base&quot;, which is rain-free, making them visible. Also, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds.

There is mounting evidence, including Doppler on Wheels mobile radar images and eyewitness accounts, that most tornadoes have a clear, calm center with extremely low pressure, akin to the eye of tropical cyclones. Lightning is said to be the source of illumination for those who claim to have seen the interior of a tornado.

===Rotation===
Tornadoes normally rotate cyclonically (when viewed from above, this is counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern). While large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the Coriolis effect, thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of the Coriolis effect is negligible, as indicated by their large Rossby numbers. Supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the Coriolis effect is neglected. Low-level mesocyclones and tornadoes owe their rotation to complex processes within the supercell and ambient environment.

Approximately 1 percent of tornadoes rotate in an anticyclonic direction in the northern hemisphere. Typically, systems as weak as landspouts and gustnadoes can rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending rear flank downdraft (RFD) in a cyclonic supercell. On rare occasions, anticyclonic tornadoes form in association with the mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, in the same manner as the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornado either as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell.

=== Sound and seismology ===

Tornadoes emit widely on the acoustics spectrum and the sounds are caused by multiple mechanisms. Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported, mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar. Popularly reported sounds include a freight train, rushing rapids or waterfall, a nearby jet engine, or combinations of these. Many tornadoes are not audible from much distance; the nature of and the propagation distance of the audible sound depends on atmospheric conditions and topography.

The winds of the tornado vortex and of constituent turbulent eddies, as well as airflow interaction with the surface and debris, contribute to the sounds. Funnel clouds also produce sounds. Funnel clouds and small tornadoes are reported as whistling, whining, humming, or the buzzing of innumerable bees or electricity, or more or less harmonic, whereas many tornadoes are reported as a continuous, deep rumbling, or an irregular sound of &quot;noise&quot;.

Since many tornadoes are audible only when very near, sound is not to be thought of as a reliable warning signal for a tornado. Tornadoes are also not the only source of such sounds in severe thunderstorms; any strong, damaging wind, a severe hail volley, or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound.

Tornadoes also produce identifiable inaudible infrasonic signatures.

Unlike audible signatures, tornadic signatures have been isolated; due to the long-distance propagation of low-frequency sound, efforts are ongoing to develop tornado prediction and detection devices with additional value in understanding tornado morphology, dynamics, and creation. Tornadoes also produce a detectable seismic signature, and research continues on isolating it and understanding the process.

===Electromagnetic, lightning, and other effects===
Tornadoes emit on the electromagnetic spectrum, with sferics and E-field effects detected. There are observed correlations between tornadoes and patterns of lightning. Tornadic storms do not produce more lightning than other storms and some tornadic cells never produce lightning at all. More often than not, overall cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity decreases as a tornado touches the surface and returns to the baseline level when the tornado dissipates. In many cases, intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance of positive polarity CG discharges.

Luminosity has been reported in the past and is probably due to misidentification of external light sources such as lightning, city lights, and power flashes from broken lines, as internal sources are now uncommonly reported and are not known to ever have been recorded. In addition to winds, tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric variables such as temperature, moisture, and atmospheric pressure. For example, on June 24, 2003, near Manchester, South Dakota, a probe measured a pressure decrease. The pressure dropped gradually as the vortex approached then dropped extremely rapidly to in the core of the violent tornado before rising rapidly as the vortex moved away, resulting in a V-shape pressure trace. Temperature tends to decrease and moisture content to increase in the immediate vicinity of a tornado.

== Life cycle ==

=== Supercell relationship ===

Tornadoes often develop from a class of thunderstorms known as supercells. Supercells contain mesocyclones, an area of organized rotation a few kilometers/miles up in the atmosphere, usually across. Most intense tornadoes (EF3 to EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale) develop from supercells. In addition to tornadoes, very heavy rain, frequent lightning, strong wind gusts, and hail are common in such storms.

Most tornadoes from supercells follow a recognizable life cycle which begins when increasing rainfall drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the rear flank downdraft (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the supercell&#x27;s rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.

=== Formation ===

As the mesocyclone lowers below the cloud base, it begins to take in cool, moist air from the downdraft region of the storm. The convergence of warm air in the updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone&#x27;s base, causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an area of low pressure at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, in the form of a visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, fanning outward and creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground. Many other aspects of tornado formation (such as why some storms form tornadoes while others do not, or what precise role downdrafts, temperature, and moisture play in tornado formation) are still poorly understood.

=== Maturity ===

Initially, the tornado has a good source of warm, moist air flowing inward to power it, and it grows until it reaches the &quot;mature stage&quot;. This can last from a few minutes to more than an hour, and during that time a tornado often causes the most damage, and in rare cases can be more than across. The low pressured atmosphere at the base of the tornado is essential to the endurance of the system. Meanwhile, the RFD, now an area of cool surface winds, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which previously fed the tornado.
The flow inside the funnel of the tornado is downward, supplying water vapor from the cloud above. This is contrary to the upward flow inside hurricanes, supplying water vapor from the warm ocean below. Therefore, the energy of the tornado is supplied from the cloud above.
=== Dissipation ===

As the RFD completely wraps around and chokes off the tornado&#x27;s air supply, the vortex begins to weaken, becoming thin and rope-like. This is the &quot;dissipating stage&quot;, often lasting no more than a few minutes, after which the tornado ends. During this stage, the shape of the tornado becomes highly influenced by the winds of the parent storm, and can be blown into fantastic patterns. Even though the tornado is dissipating, it is still capable of causing damage. The storm is contracting into a rope-like tube and, due to conservation of angular momentum, winds can increase at this point.

As the tornado enters the dissipating stage, its associated mesocyclone often weakens as well, as the rear flank downdraft cuts off the inflow powering it. Sometimes, in intense supercells, tornadoes can develop . As the first mesocyclone and associated tornado dissipate, the storm&#x27;s inflow may be concentrated into a new area closer to the center of the storm and possibly feed a new mesocyclone. If a new mesocyclone develops, the cycle may start again, producing one or more new tornadoes. Occasionally, the old (occluded) mesocyclone and the new mesocyclone produce a tornado at the same time.

Although this is a widely accepted theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their development—however, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one.

==Types==

===Multiple vortex===

A &quot;multiple-vortex tornado&quot; is a type of tornado in which two or more columns of spinning air rotate about their own axes and at the same time revolve around a common center. A multi-vortex structure can occur in almost any circulation, but is very often observed in intense tornadoes. These vortices often create small areas of heavier damage along the main tornado path. This is a phenomenon that is distinct from a satellite tornado, which is a smaller tornado that forms very near a large, strong tornado contained within the same mesocyclone. The satellite tornado may appear to &quot;orbit&quot; the larger tornado (hence the name), giving the appearance of one, large multi-vortex tornado. However, a satellite tornado is a distinct circulation, and is much smaller than the main funnel.

===Waterspout===


A &quot;waterspout&quot; is defined by the National Weather Service as a tornado over water. However, researchers typically distinguish &quot;fair weather&quot; waterspouts from tornadic (i.e. associated with a mesocyclone) waterspouts. Fair weather waterspouts are less severe but far more common, and are similar to dust devils and landspouts. They form at the bases of cumulus congestus clouds over tropical and subtropical waters. They have relatively weak winds, smooth laminar walls, and typically travel very slowly. They occur most commonly in the Florida Keys and in the northern Adriatic Sea. In contrast, tornadic waterspouts are stronger tornadoes over water. They form over water similarly to mesocyclonic tornadoes, or are stronger tornadoes which cross over water. Since they form from severe thunderstorms and can be far more intense, faster, and longer-lived than fair weather waterspouts, they are more dangerous. In official tornado statistics, waterspouts are generally not counted unless they affect land, though some European weather agencies count waterspouts and tornadoes together.

===Landspout===

A &quot;landspout&quot;, or &quot;dust-tube tornado&quot;, is a tornado not associated with a mesocyclone. The name stems from their characterization as a &quot;fair weather waterspout on land&quot;. Waterspouts and landspouts share many defining characteristics, including relative weakness, short lifespan, and a small, smooth condensation funnel that often does not reach the surface. Landspouts also create a distinctively laminar cloud of dust when they make contact with the ground, due to their differing mechanics from true mesoform tornadoes. Though usually weaker than classic tornadoes, they can produce strong winds which could cause serious damage.

===Similar circulations===

====Gustnado====
A &quot;gustnado&quot;, or &quot;gust front tornado&quot;, is a small, vertical swirl associated with a gust front or downburst. Because they are not connected with a cloud base, there is some debate as to whether or not gustnadoes are tornadoes. They are formed when fast-moving cold, dry outflow air from a thunderstorm is blown through a mass of stationary, warm, moist air near the outflow boundary, resulting in a &quot;rolling&quot; effect (often exemplified through a roll cloud). If low level wind shear is strong enough, the rotation can be turned vertically or diagonally and make contact with the ground. The result is a gustnado. They usually cause small areas of heavier rotational wind damage among areas of straight-line wind damage.

====Dust devil====


A &quot;dust devil&quot; (also known as a whirlwind) resembles a tornado in that it is a vertical swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are no stronger than the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low-level wind shear, the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any clouds. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage.

====Fire whirls====
Small-scale, tornado-like circulations can occur near any intense surface heat source. Those that occur near intense wildfires are called &quot;fire whirls&quot;. They are not considered tornadoes, except in the rare case where they connect to a pyrocumulus or other cumuliform cloud above. Fire whirls usually are not as strong as tornadoes associated with thunderstorms. They can, however, produce significant damage.

====Steam devils====
A &quot;steam devil&quot; is a rotating updraft between that involves steam or smoke. These formations do not involve high wind speeds, only completing a few rotations per minute. Steam devils are very rare. They most often form from smoke issuing from a power plant&#x27;s smokestack. Hot springs and deserts may also be suitable locations for a tighter, faster-rotating steam devil to form. The phenomenon can occur over water, when cold arctic air passes over relatively warm water.

==Intensity and damage==

The Fujita scale, Enhanced Fujita scale (EF), and International Fujita scale rate tornadoes by damage caused. The EF scale was an update to the older Fujita scale, by expert elicitation, using engineered wind estimates and better damage descriptions. The EF scale was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating, and was implemented starting in the United States in 2007. An EF0 tornado will probably damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an EF5 tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. Doppler weather radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.

Tornadoes vary in intensity regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. The association with track length and duration also varies, although longer track tornadoes tend to be stronger.&lt;ref name=&quot;width/length intensity relationship&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of violent tornadoes, only a small portion of the path is of violent intensity, most of the higher intensity from subvortices.

In the United States, 80% of tornadoes are EF0 and EF1 (T0 through T3) tornadoes. The rate of occurrence drops off quickly with increasing strength—less than 1% are violent tornadoes (EF4, T8 or stronger). Current records may significantly underestimate the frequency of strong (EF2-EF3) and violent (EF4-EF5) tornadoes, as damage-based intensity estimates are limited to structures and vegetation that a tornado impacts. A tornado may be much stronger than its damage-based rating indicates if its strongest winds occur away from suitable damage indicators, such as in an open field. Outside Tornado Alley, and North America in general, violent tornadoes are extremely rare. This is apparently mostly due to the lesser number of tornadoes overall, as research shows that tornado intensity distributions are fairly similar worldwide. A few significant tornadoes occur annually in Europe, Asia, southern Africa, and southeastern South America.
==Climatology==

The United States has the most tornadoes of any country, nearly four times more than estimated in all of Europe, excluding waterspouts. This is mostly due to the unique geography of the continent. North America is a large continent that extends from the tropics north into arctic areas, and has no major east–west mountain range to block air flow between these two areas. In the middle latitudes, where most tornadoes of the world occur, the Rocky Mountains block moisture and buckle the atmospheric flow, forcing drier air at mid-levels of the troposphere due to downsloped winds, and causing the formation of a low pressure area downwind to the east of the mountains. Increased westerly flow off the Rockies force the formation of a dry line when the flow aloft is strong, while the Gulf of Mexico fuels abundant low-level moisture in the southerly flow to its east. This unique topography allows for frequent collisions of warm and cold air, the conditions that breed strong, long-lived storms throughout the year. A large portion of these tornadoes form in an area of the central United States known as Tornado Alley. This area extends into Canada, particularly Ontario and the Prairie Provinces, although southeast Quebec, the interior of British Columbia, and western New Brunswick are also tornado-prone. Tornadoes also occur across northeastern Mexico.

The United States averages about 1,200 tornadoes per year, followed by Canada, averaging 62 reported per year. NOAA&#x27;s has a higher average 100 per year in Canada. The Netherlands has the highest average number of recorded tornadoes per area of any country (more than 20, or annually), followed by the UK (around 33, per year), although those are of lower intensity, briefer and cause minor damage.
Tornadoes kill an average of 179 people per year in Bangladesh, the most in the world. Reasons for this include the region&#x27;s high population density, poor construction quality, and lack of tornado safety knowledge. Other areas of the world that have frequent tornadoes include South Africa, the La Plata Basin area, portions of Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and far eastern Asia.

Tornadoes are most common in spring and least common in winter, but tornadoes can occur any time of year that favorable conditions occur. Spring and fall experience peaks of activity as those are the seasons when stronger winds, wind shear, and atmospheric instability are present. Tornadoes are focused in the right front quadrant of landfalling tropical cyclones, which tend to occur in the late summer and autumn. Tornadoes can also be spawned as a result of eyewall mesovortices, which persist until landfall. Tornados can even form during snow squalls events with no rain present.

Tornado occurrence is highly dependent on the time of day, because of solar heating. Worldwide, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, between 15:00 (3 pm) and 19:00 (7 pm) local time, with a peak near 17:00 (5 pm). Destructive tornadoes can occur at any time of day. The Gainesville Tornado of 1936, one of the deadliest tornadoes in history, occurred at 8:30 am local time.

The United Kingdom has the highest incidence of tornadoes per unit area of land in the world. Unsettled conditions and weather fronts transverse the British Isles at all times of the years, and are responsible for spawning the tornadoes, which consequently form at all times of the year. The United Kingdom has at least 34 tornadoes per year and possibly as many as 50. Most tornadoes in the United Kingdom are weak, but they are occasionally destructive. For example, the Birmingham tornado of 2005 and the London tornado of 2006 both registered F2 on the Fujita scale and both caused significant damage and injury.

===Associations with climate and climate change===

Associations with various climate and environmental trends exist. For example, an increase in the sea surface temperature of a source region (e.g. Gulf of Mexico and Mediterranean Sea) increases atmospheric moisture content. Increased moisture can fuel an increase in severe weather and tornado activity, particularly in the cool season.

Some evidence does suggest that the Southern Oscillation is weakly correlated with changes in tornado activity, which vary by season and region, as well as whether the ENSO phase is that of El Niño or La Niña. Research has found that fewer tornadoes and hailstorms occur in winter and spring in the U.S. central and southern plains during El Niño, and more occur during La Niña, than in years when temperatures in the Pacific are relatively stable. Ocean conditions could be used to forecast extreme spring storm events several months in advance.

Climatic shifts may affect tornadoes via teleconnections in shifting the jet stream and the larger weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although it is reasonable to suspect that global warming may affect trends in tornado activity, any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region.

==Detection==
Rigorous attempts to warn of tornadoes began in the United States in the mid-20th century. Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm. However, with the advent of weather radar, areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public tornado warnings were issued in 1950 and the first tornado watches and convective outlooks came about in 1952. In 1953, it was confirmed that hook echoes were associated with tornadoes. By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms probably producing tornadoes from several miles away.

=== Radar ===
Today most developed countries have a network of weather radars, which serves as the primary method of detecting hook signatures that are likely associated with tornadoes. In the United States and a few other countries, Doppler weather radar stations are used. These devices measure the velocity and radial direction (towards or away from the radar) of the winds within a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from over away. When storms are distant from a radar, only areas high within the storm are observed and the important areas below are not sampled. Data resolution also decreases with distance from the radar. Some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and tornado development may occasionally take place more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data. Doppler weather radar systems can detect mesocyclones within a supercell thunderstorm. This allows meteorologists to predict tornado formations throughout thunderstorms.

===Storm spotting===
Spotters usually are trained by the NWS on behalf of their respective organizations, and report to them. The organizations activate public warning systems such as sirens and the Emergency Alert System (EAS), and they forward the report to the NWS.
There are more than 230,000 trained Skywarn weather spotters across the United States.

In Canada, a similar network of volunteer weather watchers, called Canwarn, helps spot severe weather, with more than 1,000 volunteers. In Europe, several nations are organizing spotter networks under the auspices of Skywarn Europe and the Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO) has maintained a network of spotters in the United Kingdom since 1974.

Storm spotters are required because radar systems such as NEXRAD detect signatures that suggest the presence of tornadoes, rather than tornadoes as such. Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or an imminent one, but ground truth from an observer can give definitive information. The spotter&#x27;s ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out.

===Visual evidence===

Storm spotters are trained to discern whether or not a storm seen from a distance is a supercell. They typically look to its rear, the main region of updraft and inflow. Under that updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of tornadogenesis is the formation of a rotating wall cloud. The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell.

Evidence of a supercell is based on the storm&#x27;s shape and structure, and cloud tower features such as a hard and vigorous updraft tower, a persistent, large overshooting top, a hard anvil (especially when backsheared against strong upper level winds), and a corkscrew look or striations. Under the storm and closer to where most tornadoes are found, evidence of a supercell and the likelihood of a tornado includes inflow bands (particularly when curved) such as a &quot;beaver tail&quot;, and other clues such as strength of inflow, warmth and moistness of inflow air, how outflow- or inflow-dominant a storm appears, and how far is the front flank precipitation core from the wall cloud. Tornadogenesis is most likely at the interface of the updraft and rear flank downdraft, and requires a balance between the outflow and inflow.

Only wall clouds that rotate spawn tornadoes, and they usually precede the tornado between five and thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds may be a visual manifestation of a low-level mesocyclone. Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a rear flank downdraft occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of cloud adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly afterwards; first, a funnel cloud dips and in nearly all cases by the time it reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also develop without wall clouds, under flanking lines and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the cloud base and surface.

==Extremes==
The tornado which holds most records in history was the Tri-State Tornado, which roared through parts of Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana on March 18, 1925. It was likely an F5, though tornadoes were not ranked on any scale in that era. It holds records for longest path length (), longest duration (about 3.5 hours), and fastest forward speed for a significant tornado () anywhere on Earth. In addition, it is the deadliest single tornado in United States history (695 dead). The tornado was also the costliest tornado in history at the time (unadjusted for inflation), but in the years since has been surpassed by several others if population changes over time are not considered. When costs are normalized for wealth and inflation, it ranks third today.

The deadliest tornado in world history was the Daultipur-Salturia Tornado in Bangladesh on April 26, 1989, which killed approximately 1,300 people. Bangladesh has had at least 24 tornadoes in its history that killed more than 100 people, almost half of the rest of the world. 

One of the most extensive tornado outbreaks on record was the 1974 Super Outbreak, which affected a large area of the central United States and extreme southern Ontario on April 3 and 4, 1974. The outbreak featured 148 tornadoes in 18 hours, many of which were violent; seven were of F5 intensity, and twenty-three peaked at F4 strength. Sixteen tornadoes were on the ground at the same time during its peak. More than 300 people, possibly as many as 330, were killed.

While direct measurement of the most violent tornado wind speeds is nearly impossible, since conventional anemometers would be destroyed by the intense winds and flying debris, some tornadoes have been scanned by mobile Doppler radar units, which can provide a good estimate of the tornado&#x27;s winds. The highest wind speed ever measured in a tornado, which is also the highest wind speed ever recorded on the planet, is 301 ± 20 mph (484 ± 32 km/h) in the F5 Bridge Creek-Moore, Oklahoma, tornado which killed 36 people. The reading was taken about above the ground.

Storms that produce tornadoes can feature intense updrafts, sometimes exceeding . Debris from a tornado can be lofted into the parent storm and carried a very long distance. A tornado which affected Great Bend, Kansas, in November 1915, was an extreme case, where a &quot;rain of debris&quot; occurred from the town, a sack of flour was found away, and a cancelled check from the Great Bend bank was found in a field outside of Palmyra, Nebraska, to the northeast. Waterspouts and tornadoes have been advanced as an explanation for instances of raining fish and other animals.

== Safety ==
Though tornadoes can strike in an instant, there are precautions and preventative measures that can be taken to increase the chances of survival. Authorities such as the Storm Prediction Center in the United States advise having a pre-determined plan should a tornado warning be issued. When a warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival. In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have underground storm cellars, which have saved thousands of lives.

Some countries have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert of a possible tornado (such as tornado watches and warnings in the United States and Canada). Weather radios provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area, mainly available only in the United States. Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far to the side of the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find a sturdy shelter. If no sturdy shelter is nearby, getting low in a ditch is the next best option. Highway overpasses are one of the worst places to take shelter during tornadoes, as the constricted space can be subject to increased wind speed and funneling of debris underneath the overpass.

==Myths and misconceptions==

Folklore often identifies a green sky with tornadoes, and though the phenomenon may be associated with severe weather, there is no evidence linking it specifically with tornadoes. It is often thought that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in atmospheric pressure inside a strong tornado, the pressure difference is unlikely to cause significant damage. Opening windows may instead increase the severity of the tornado&#x27;s damage. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed.
Another commonly held misconception is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. This belief is partly inspired by widely circulated video captured during the 1991 tornado outbreak near Andover, Kansas, where a news crew and several other people took shelter under an overpass on the Kansas Turnpike and safely rode out a tornado as it passed nearby. However, a highway overpass is a dangerous place during a tornado, and the subjects of the video remained safe due to an unlikely combination of events: the storm in question was a weak tornado, the tornado did not directly strike the overpass, and the overpass itself was of a unique design. Due to the Venturi effect, tornadic winds are accelerated in the confined space of an overpass. Indeed, in the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, and at each of the three locations there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries. By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2,000 homes were completely destroyed and another 7,000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes.

An old belief is that the southwest corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado&#x27;s direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter in a basement, under a staircase, or under a sturdy piece of furniture such as a workbench further increases the chances of survival.

There are areas which people believe to be protected from tornadoes, whether by being in a city, near a major river, hill, or mountain, or even protected by supernatural forces. Tornadoes have been known to cross major rivers, climb mountains, affect valleys, and have damaged several city centers. As a general rule, no area is safe from tornadoes, though some areas are more susceptible than others.

==Ongoing research==
Meteorology is a relatively young science and the study of tornadoes is newer still. Although researched for about 140 years and intensively so for around 60 years, there are still aspects of tornadoes which remain a mystery. Meteorologists have a fairly good understanding of the development of thunderstorms and mesocyclones, and the meteorological conditions conducive to their formation. However, the step from supercell, or other respective formative processes, to tornadogenesis and the prediction of tornadic vs. non-tornadic mesocyclones is not yet well known and is the focus of much research.

Also under study are the low-level mesocyclone and the stretching of low-level vorticity which tightens into a tornado, in particular, what are the processes and what is the relationship of the environment and the convective storm. Intense tornadoes have been observed forming simultaneously with a mesocyclone aloft (rather than succeeding mesocyclogenesis) and some intense tornadoes have occurred without a mid-level mesocyclone.

In particular, the role of downdrafts, particularly the rear-flank downdraft, and the role of baroclinic boundaries, are intense areas of study.

Reliably predicting tornado intensity and longevity remains a problem, as do details affecting characteristics of a tornado during its life cycle and tornadolysis. Other rich areas of research are tornadoes associated with mesovortices within linear thunderstorm structures and within tropical cyclones.

Meteorologists still do not know the exact mechanisms by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued. Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial) in-situ and remote sensing (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions. Numerical modeling also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in computer simulations which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, many of which are otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.

Research programs, including field projects such as the VORTEX projects (Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment), deployment of TOTO (the TOtable Tornado Observatory), Doppler on Wheels (DOW), and dozens of other programs, hope to solve many questions that still plague meteorologists. Universities, government agencies such as the National Severe Storms Laboratory, private-sector meteorologists, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research are some of the organizations very active in research; with various sources of funding, both private and public, a chief entity being the National Science Foundation. The pace of research is partly constrained by the number of observations that can be taken; gaps in information about the wind, pressure, and moisture content throughout the local atmosphere; and the computing power available for simulation.

Solar storms similar to tornadoes have been recorded, but it is unknown how closely related they are to their terrestrial counterparts.

<text>The Indian Institute of Science (IISc) is a public, deemed, research university for higher education and research in science, engineering, design, and management. It is located in Bengaluru, Karnataka. The institute was established in 1909 with active support from Jamsetji Tata and thus is also locally known as the Tata Institute. It was granted a deemed university status in 1958 and recognized as an Institute of Eminence in 2018.

==History==
=== Foundations and Early History ===


After an accidental meeting between Jamsetji Tata and Swami Vivekananda, on a ship in 1893 where they discussed Tata&#x27;s plan of bringing the steel industry to India, Tata wrote to Vivekananda five years later: &quot;I trust, you remember me as a fellow-traveller on your voyage from Japan to Chicago. I very much recall at this moment your views on the growth of the ascetic spirit in India... I recall these ideas in connection with my scheme of Research Institute of Science for India, of which you have doubtless heard or read.&quot;

Impressed by Vivekananda&#x27;s views on science and leadership abilities, Tata wanted him to guide his campaign. Vivekananda endorsed the project with enthusiasm, and Tata, with the aim of advancing the scientific capabilities of the country, constituted a provisional committee to prepare a plan for setting up of an institute of research and higher education. The committee presented a draft proposal to Viceroy George Curzon on 31 December 1898. Subsequently, Sir William Ramsay, a Nobel Laureate, was called on to propose a suitable place for such an institution who suggested Bangalore as the best location.

The land and other facilities for the institution were donated by Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV and Tata. The maharaja donated about of land; Tata gave several buildings towards the creation of IISc. This land included the former village of Medaraninganahalli. A Kannada inscription dated to 1669 CE records the donation of Medaraninganahalli to the Mallapura Mallikarjuna temple by the Maratha king Ekoji I. More information about this inscription can be found here. The maharaja also granted Rs 5,00,000 towards capital expenditure and Rs 50,000 for annual expense. Nizam Osman Ali Khan also contributed, which amounted to around Rs 3,00,000 over a period of 31 years.

The constitution of the institute was approved by Viceroy Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, and the necessary &quot;vesting order&quot; to enable it to function was signed on 27 May 1909. Early in 1911, the maharaja laid the foundation stone of the institute, and on 24 July, the first batch of students were admitted to the Departments of General and Applied Chemistry under Norman Rudolf and Electro-Technology under Alfred Hay. Within two months, the Department of Organic Chemistry was opened. In 1958, the institute was deemed a university by the University Grants Commission of India.

At the time of the inception of IISc in 1909, Morris Travers, Sir William Ramsay&#x27;s co-worker in the discovery of the noble gases, became its first director. For Travers, this was a natural continuation of his work on the institute, since he had played a role in its founding. The first Indian director was the Nobel Laureate Sir C.V. Raman.

The institute was the first to introduce a master&#x27;s programs in engineering. It has also started integrated doctoral programmes in biological, chemical, physical, and mathematical sciences for natural science graduates.

=== Recent History ===

On 28 December 2005, two terrorists started firing indiscriminately inside the IISc campus. Munish Chander Puri, a professor from IIT Delhi, died in the attack. Four others were injured.

In 2018, the IISc was one of the first six institutes to be awarded the Institute of Eminence status. In 2019, the IISc launched its brand statement: &quot;Discover and Innovate; Transform and Transcend; Serve and Lead&quot;.

In 2022, the IISc received a private donation of 425 crore Indian Rupees, the largest in its history, to establish a postgraduate medical institute.

== Campus ==
The institute&#x27;s Main Campus is fully residential and is spread over 400 acres of land in the heart of Bangalore city. It is located in the north of Bangalore, about 6 kilometres from Bangalore City Railway Station and Kempegowda Bus Station, on the way to Yeshwantpur. It is connected with city&#x27;s Namma Metro Sandal Soap Factory metro station and by various bus stations of Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation. The institute is about 30 kilometres southwest of Kempegowda International Airport. As a research hub, it is in the vicinity of a number of other research institutes, Raman Research Institute, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), Wood Research Institute and Central Power Research Institute (CPRI), are close to IISc. Most of these institutes are connected to IISc by a regular shuttle bus service. 

The main campus houses more than 40 departments marked by routes such as the Gulmohar Marga, the Mahogany Marga, the Badami Marga, the Tala Marga, the Ashoka Marga, the Nilgiri Marg, the Silver Oak Marg, the Amra Marga and the Arjuna Marga. The campus features six canteens (cafeterias), a gymkhana (gymnasium and sports complex), a football ground and a cricket ground, five dining messes (halls), one multi cuisine restaurant, nine men&#x27;s and five women&#x27;s hostels (dormitories), an air strip, a library, two shopping centers and residences of the faculty members and other staff, besides other amenities.

The IISc campus harbours both exotic and indigenous plant species with about 110 species of woody plants. The roads on the campus are named after the dominant avenue tree species.
The architecture of the Main Building, which today houses the administration and the Faculty Hall, is classical in style, fronted by a grey, handsome tower. In front of it stands the work of Gilbert Bayes, a monument erected in the memory of J. N. Tata. At its feet is an inscription that serves to remind future generations of the generosity of Jamsetji Tata and the persistence with which he worked for the welfare of India. The building, as one of the prominent landmarks of Bangalore, was designed by C. F. Stevens and Company of Bombay in 1912–13.
===J. R. D. Tata Memorial Library===
J. R. D. Tata Memorial Library is the main library of IISc. Apart from the main library, the institute also has independent departmental libraries. The library moved into the present premises in January 1965, built out of grants provided by University Grants Commission (UGC), in commemoration of the golden jubilee celebrations of the institute in 1959. In 1995, the library was renamed as &quot;J. R. D. Tata Memorial Library&quot;. The National Board for Higher Mathematics (NBHM) has recognised this library as Regional Center for Mathematics for the south region and continued to award a special grant towards subscription of Journals in Mathematics.

The annual budget of the library is over Rs. 100 million (almost US$2,500,000) of which subscription towards periodicals alone is about Rs. 90 million. The library currently receives over 1,734 periodical titles, of which 1381 are subscribed, while the remaining titles are received as gratis or on an exchange basis. About 600 titles are accessible through the library subscription. In addition, over 10,000 journals are accessible online, thanks to INDEST subscription. The total holdings of the library exceed 411,000 documents.
The buildings for the metallurgy and aerospace departments were designed by the German architect Otto Königsberger in 1940.
=== Historical artifacts on campus ===

A 10th century &quot;hulibete veeragallu&quot;, or hero stone commemorating a fight with a tiger, was discovered on the IISc campus in the late 1970s by two children of a professor who lived there. Veeragallus were typically erected to honor individuals who died in acts of valor, usually civilians. They are found mostly in the Karnataka region, dating from the 8th to 17th centuries. Those with inscriptions are especially helpful to historians as they provide more context about the event and martyr.

While the IISc veeragallu lacks an inscription, experts believe it dates to the 10th century when the Western Gangas ruled Bangalore. The sculpture is partially damaged, but you can still see the martyr&#x27;s left hand gripping a bow and his right hand about to shoot an arrow at an attacking tiger.

This is one of only three known &quot;hulibete veeragallus&quot; in Bangalore. The others are located at Bangalore University (7th or 8th century) and in Madivala (14th century).

=== Challakere Campus ===
A second campus is in Challakere, on a lot of land. Research centres and labs here include the Talent Development Centre, Skill Development Centre funded by HAL under CSR Act, Solar Power Research Center and a Climate Observatory. The Centre for Sustainable Technologies has commenced its activities here under the project &quot;C-BELT&quot; i.e., the Centre for Bio-energy and Low-Carbon Technologies.

Janardhana Swamy, then Member of Parliament from the Chitradurga Lok Sabha as well as a notable alumnus of IISc and Amalan Biswas, then DC of Chitradurga District played significant roles in setting up the IISc&#x27;s new campus at Challakere. They were instrumental in identifying all the required 1500 acres of land for the new campus, getting the existing building leased from the Sheep Farm, obtaining the various needed approvals from the government, and having the initial funds released from the State.

==Organisation and administration==
===Academic divisions, departments, and centres===
For academic purposes, departments and centres in the institute are broadly assigned to either the Science Faculty or the Engineering Faculty. For administrative purposes (such as faculty recruitment, assessment and promotion), departments and centres are classified into six divisions, each headed by a chairperson. Each department or centre is administered by a chairperson.
 
The following centres are directly under the director (without a divisional chairman):
Autonomous Societies and Centres based in the Institute:

===Academic programs===

====Post-graduate research programs====

Research students constitute more than 60 % of the students on the campus. PhD degrees offered in 40 different disciplines. Research programs leading to doctoral degrees are the main thrust in many departments. The program has a limited amount of course work, essentially to prepare the student to carry out the research, but the main emphasis is on the thesis work. The annual intake of research students is approximately 575 with several candidates sponsored from educational institutions and industries (through External Registration Program). 

The Integrated PhD program is designed to offer opportunities to 3-year BSc graduates for pursuing advanced research in areas of biological, chemical, mathematical, and physical Sciences, leading to the PhD degree. In 2024, IISc launched new short courses on Computational Structural Reliability.

==== Post-graduate coursework programs ====

The two-year M.Tech. program is available in almost all engineering departments. Most MTech programs have a set of hard core courses specified as an essential requirement whereas students can take rest of the credits from many courses available in their parent or other departments and also do a dissertation work on the topic of their choice.

Master&#x27;s degrees offered by the institute are classified into two categories: degrees by coursework (M.Tech., M.Mgt., and M.Des.) and degrees by research (M.Tech. research).

The Department of Management Studies offers a Master of Management program exclusively for engineering graduates. The Center for Product Design and Manufacturing offers the Master of Design (M.Des.) course. Started in 1996, the M.Des. program is a two-year, full-time postgraduate program.

In keeping with India&#x27;s recent National Education Policy (NEP 2020), IISc has launched the Master of Technology (Online) degree program, a fully online program, for practicing engineers and scientists from academic year 2022–2023. The degree program is for professionals who are sponsored by organisations, who already have a BE/BTech/Equivalent degree and wish to upskill or re-skill themselves in streams like Data Science and Business Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Electronics and Communication Engineering.

The institute has recently announced MSc program in life sciences and chemical sciences starting from academic year of 2022–23. These 2 years master&#x27;s degree programs consist of foundational and flexible coursework and hands-on laboratory training. The design is aimed to develop experimental skills in advanced techniques for research, leading to an independent thesis research project. Students enrolled in the M Sc programs can personalize their coursework and research projects.

==== Undergraduate program ====

An undergraduate program in science for students after Class XII was conceived during the Centenary Celebrations in 2009. The first batch of students was admitted in 2011. The program offers a four-year Bachelor of Science (Research) and a five-year integrated Master of Science course in six disciplines: Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science, Material Science, Mathematics, and Physics. The course aims at exposing the students to the inter-disciplinary nature in which scientific research is done in many upcoming fields.

A new undergraduate program B.Tech. in Mathematics and Computing seeks to enter a niche area with the aim of producing future leaders who will be at the forefront of research, development, and innovation in futuristic disciplines and next generation technologies that require deep use of mathematics, computer science, and data science.

Admission to the undergraduate programs is through one of two channels:The JEE Advanced and the IISER Aptitute Test. (as of 2025)

===Central computing facility===
The Computer Centre, established in 1970 as a central computing facility, became Supercomputer Education and Research Centre (SERC) in 1990 to provide computing facility to the faculty and students of the institute. SERC was created and fully funded by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India to commemorate the platinum jubilee of the institute. It houses India&#x27;s first petascale supercomputer Cray XC40, the erstwhile fastest supercomputer in India.

Apart from functioning as a central computing facility of IISc, the SERC is engaged in education and research programs in areas relating to supercomputer development and application. The centre is also involved in several sponsored research projects in collaboration with several high-profile government and private agencies.

===Academic and industrial collaborations===

The Indian Institute of Science collaborates with various government organisations like the Indian Ordnance Factories, DRDO, the ISRO, Bharat Electronics Limited, Aeronautical Development Agency, National Aerospace Laboratories, CSIR, Department of IT (Government of India), Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, etc. IISc also works in collaboration with private industry and research labs. A few organisations have been incubated by the Society for Innovation and Development (SID) on campus, including Morphing Machines and SandI, while Gamma Porite is currently under incubation. IISc actively promotes and supports ventures by the faculty, the students and alumni. Strand Life Sciences and Ittiam are some success stories of this initiative. In March 2016, a science start-up, incubated at the IISc, built the world&#x27;s first food-grade DNA/RNA stain. This might cut the time taken to diagnose conditions such as HIV to a day, from 45 days at present.

===Rankings===

Internationally, IISc was ranked 211th in the world by the &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot; of 2025 and 58th in Asia in the &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot; of 2024. It was ranked 201–250 in the world and 32 in Asia by the &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot; in 2024. In addition, it was ranked 18 among emerging economies universities by the &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot; in 2022. It was ranked 401–500 in the world in 2024 by the &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot;.

In India, IISc was also ranked 2nd in the overall category, 1st among research institutions, and 1st among universities by the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) in 2024.

==Campus life==
===Events===
Pravega is the annual science, technology and cultural festival of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. Started in 2013 by the undergraduates of IISc, the fest is usually held on the third weekend of January.
Vijyoshi, an annual national science camp for secondary school and undergraduate students, is hosted by IISc.

IISc also has active sports teams, major ones being in cricket, football, badminton and volleyball. They participate each year in the IISM (inter IISER sports meet) and a number of other tournaments and events.

===Alumni associations===
IISc has a parent alumni association (AA) in Bangalore and several branches elsewhere including USA (IISCAANA). Of recent parent association is involved in several disputes. One of the reasons appears to be efforts by some to allow Non-IISc degree holders to become a part of the AA. Similar situation is created in IISCAANA
by allowing several non-IISc members to be active in the team. IIScAANA allows those who did not complete degree to become members by adding a clause
&#x27;completed at least one semester of course work in IISc&#x27; for membership eligibility.

=== Music Club ===

The oldest and currently active music club of IISc.

Rhythmica members are students of IISc (Undergraduate, Masters and PhD) as well as professors.

IISc also hosts a local branch of the Society for the Promotion of Indian Classical Music and Culture Amongst Youth (SPIC MACAY) that was started around 1984.

<doc id="37534" wikidata="Q1361" url="?curid=37534" title="Hyderabad">
<text>Hyderabad (; ) is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Telangana. It occupies on the Deccan Plateau along the banks of the Musi River, in the northern part of Southern India. With an average altitude of , much of Hyderabad is situated on hilly terrain around artificial lakes, including the Hussain Sagar lake, predating the city&#x27;s founding, in the north of the city centre. According to the 2011 census of India, Hyderabad is the fourth-most populous city in India with a population of residents within the city limits, and has a population of residents in the metropolitan region, making it the sixth-most populous metropolitan area in India. With an output of  95 billion, Hyderabad has the sixth-largest urban economy in India.

The Qutb Shahi dynasty&#x27;s Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah established Hyderabad in 1591 to extend the capital beyond the fortified Golconda. In 1687, the city was annexed by the Mughals. In 1724, Asaf Jah I, the Mughal viceroy, declared his sovereignty and founded the Asaf Jahi dynasty, also known as the Nizams. Hyderabad served as the imperial capital of the Asaf Jahis from 1769 to 1948. As the capital of the princely state of Hyderabad, the city housed the British Residency and cantonment until Indian independence in 1947. Hyderabad was annexed by the Indian Union in 1948 and continued as a capital of Hyderabad State from 1948 to 1956. After the introduction of the States Reorganisation Act of 1956, Hyderabad was made the capital of the newly formed Andhra Pradesh. In 2014, Andhra Pradesh was split to form the state of Telangana, and Hyderabad became the joint capital of the two states until 2024. Since 1956, the city has housed the Rashtrapati Nilayam, the winter office of the president of India.

Relics of the Qutb Shahi and Nizam eras remain visible today; the Charminar has come to symbolise the city. By the end of the early modern era, the Mughal Empire had declined in the Deccan, and the Nizam&#x27;s patronage attracted men of letters from various parts of the world. A distinctive culture arose from the amalgamation of local and migrated artisans, with painting, handicraft, jewellery, literature, dialect and clothing prominent even today. For its cuisine, the city is listed as a creative city of gastronomy by UNESCO. The Telugu film industry based in the city is the highest-grossing film industry in India .

Until the , Hyderabad was known for its pearl industry and was nicknamed the &quot;City of Pearls&quot;, and was the only trading centre for Golconda diamonds in the world. Many of the city&#x27;s historical and traditional bazaars remain open. Hyderabad&#x27;s central location between the Deccan Plateau and the Western Ghats, and industrialisation throughout the attracted major Indian research, manufacturing, educational and financial institutions. Since the 1990s, the city has emerged as an Indian hub of pharmaceuticals and biotechnology and information technology. The formation of the special economic zones of Hardware Park and HITEC City, dedicated to information technology, has encouraged leading multinationals to set up operations in Hyderabad.

== History ==
=== Toponymy ===
The name &quot;Hyderabad&quot; means &quot;Haydar&#x27;s City&quot; or &quot;Lion City&quot;, from &quot;haydar&quot; &#x27;lion&#x27; and &quot;ābād&quot; &#x27;city&#x27;, after Caliph Ali Ibn Abi Talib, also known as Haydar because of his lion-like valour in battle. The city was originally called &quot;Baghnagar&quot; (&quot;city of gardens&quot;). The European travellers von Poser and Thévenot found both names in use in the 17th century. A popular legend suggests that the founder of the city, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, named it &quot;Bhagya-nagar&quot; (&quot;fortunate city&quot;) after Bhagmati, a local &quot;nautch&quot; (dancing girl) whom he married. She converted to Islam and adopted the title &quot;Hyder Mahal&quot;, the city being subsequently named &quot;Hyderabad&quot; in her honour.

In the year 1597, Hyderabad gained the epithet &quot;Farkhunda Bunyad&quot; (). Following the Mughal conquest of Hyderabad, emperor Aurangzeb changed the epithet to &quot;Dar-ul-Jihad&quot; (), a title which appears on coins minted in the city during the reigns of Aurangzeb and Kam Bakhsh. The later Mughal emperor Shah Alam returned the city to its older epithet of &quot;Farkhunda Bunyad&quot;, and consequently Mughal coins of Shah Alam and Muhammad Shah feature this title as the city&#x27;s mint-name.

=== Early and medieval history ===

The discovery of Megalithic burial sites and cairn circles in the suburbs of Hyderabad, in 1851 by Philip Meadows Taylor, a polymath in the service of the Nizam, had provided evidence that the region in which the city stands has been inhabited since the Stone Age. In 2008, Archaeologists excavating near the city have unearthed Iron Age sites that may date from 500 BCE. The region comprising modern Hyderabad and its surroundings was ruled by the Chalukya dynasty from 624 CE to 1075 CE. Following the dissolution of the Chalukya empire into four parts in the 11th century, Golconda—now part of Hyderabad—came under the control of the Kakatiya dynasty from 1158, whose seat of power was at Warangal— northeast of modern Hyderabad. The Kakatiya ruler Ganapatideva (1199–1262) built a hilltop outpost—later known as Golconda Fort—to defend their western region.

The Kakatiya dynasty was reduced to a vassal of the Khalji dynasty in 1310 after its defeat by Sultan Alauddin Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate. This lasted until 1321 when the Kakatiya dynasty was annexed by Malik Kafur, Khalji&#x27;s general. During this period, Khalji took the &quot;Koh-i-Noor&quot; diamond, which is said to have been mined from the Kollur Mines of Golconda, to Delhi. Muhammad bin Tughluq succeeded to the Delhi sultanate in 1325, bringing Warangal under the rule of the Tughlaq dynasty; Malik Maqbul Tilangani was appointed its governor. In 1336 the regional chieftains Musunuri Nayakas—who revolted against the Delhi sultanate in 1333—took Warangal under their direct control and declared it as their capital. In 1347 when Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah, a governor under bin Tughluq, rebelled against Delhi and established the Bahmani Sultanate in the Deccan Plateau, with Gulbarga— west of Hyderabad—as its capital, both the neighbouring rulers Musunuri Nayakas of Warangal and Bahmani Sultans of Gulbarga engaged in many wars until 1364–65 when a peace treaty was signed and the Musunuri Nayakas ceded Golconda Fort to the Bahmani Sultan. The Bahmani Sultans ruled the region until 1518 and were the first independent Muslim rulers of the Deccan.

In 1496 Sultan Quli was appointed as a Bahmani governor of Telangana. He rebuilt, expanded and fortified the old mud fort of Golconda and named the city &quot;Muhammad Nagar&quot;. In 1518, he revolted against the Bahmani Sultanate and established the Qutb Shahi dynasty. The fifth Qutb Shahi sultan, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, established Hyderabad on the banks of the Musi River in 1591, to avoid water shortages experienced at Golconda. During his rule, he had the Charminar and Mecca Masjid built in the city. On 21 September 1687, the Golconda Sultanate came under the rule of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb after a year-long siege of the Golconda Fort. The annexed city &quot;Hyderabad&quot; was renamed &quot;Darul Jihad&quot; (House of War), whereas the main territories of the Golconda Sultanate were incorporated into the Mughal empire as the province Hyderabad Subah. Mughal rule in Hyderabad was administered by three main governors: Jan Sipar Khan (1688–1700), his son Rustam Dil Khan (1700–13) and Mubariz Khan (1713–24).

=== Modern history ===
In 1713, Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar appointed Mubariz Khan as Governor of Hyderabad. During his tenure, he fortified the city and controlled the internal and neighbouring threats. In 1714 Farrukhsiyar appointed Asaf Jah I as Viceroy of the Deccan—(administrator of six Mughal governorates) with the title &quot;Nizam-ul-Mulk&quot; (Administrator of the Realm). In 1721, he was appointed as Prime Minister of the Mughal Empire. His differences with the court nobles led him to resign from all the imperial responsibilities in 1723 and leave for Deccan. Under the influence of Asaf Jah I&#x27;s opponents, Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah issued a decree to Mubariz Khan, to stop Asaf Jah I which resulted in the Battle of Shakar Kheda. In 1724, Asaf Jah I defeated Mubariz Khan to establish autonomy over the &quot;Deccan&quot;, named the region &quot;Hyderabad Deccan&quot;, and started what came to be known as the Asaf Jahi dynasty. Subsequent rulers retained the title &quot;Nizam ul-Mulk&quot; and were referred to as Asaf Jahi Nizams, or Nizams of Hyderabad. The death of Asaf Jah I in 1748 resulted in a period of political unrest as his sons and grandson—Nasir Jung (1748–1750), Muzaffar Jang (1750–1751) and Salabat Jung (1751–1762)—contended for the throne backed by opportunistic neighbouring states and colonial foreign forces. The accession of Asaf Jah II, who reigned from 1762 to 1803, ended the instability. In 1768 he signed the Treaty of Masulipatam—by which the East India Company in return for a fixed annual rent, got the right to control and collect the taxes at Coromandel Coast.

In 1769 Hyderabad city became the formal capital of the Asaf Jahi Nizams. In response to regular threats from Hyder Ali (Dalwai of Mysore), Baji Rao I (Peshwa of the Maratha Empire), and Basalath Jung (Asaf Jah II&#x27;s elder brother, who was supported by French General the Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau), the Nizam signed a subsidiary alliance with the East India Company in 1798, allowing the British Indian Army to be stationed at Bolarum (modern Secunderabad) to protect the state&#x27;s capital, for which the Nizams paid an annual maintenance to the British.

Until 1874 there were no modern industries in Hyderabad. With the introduction of railways in the 1880s, four factories were built to the south and east of Hussain Sagar lake, and during the early 20th century, Hyderabad was transformed into a modern city with the establishment of transport services, underground drainage, running water, electricity, telecommunications, universities, industries, and Begumpet Airport. The Nizams ruled the princely state of Hyderabad during the British Raj.

==== Post-Independence ====

After India gained independence, the Nizam declared his intention to remain independent rather than become part of the Indian Union or newly formed Dominion of Pakistan. The Hyderabad State Congress, with the support of the Indian National Congress and the Communist Party of India, began agitating against Nizam VII in 1948. On 17 September that year, the Indian Army took control of Hyderabad State after an invasion codenamed Operation Polo. With the defeat of his forces, Nizam VII capitulated to the Indian Union by signing an Instrument of Accession, which made him the &quot;Rajpramukh&quot; (Princely Governor) of the state until it was abolished on 31 October 1956.

Between 1946 and 1951, the Communist Party of India fomented the Telangana uprising against the feudal lords of the Telangana region. The Constitution of India, which became effective on 26 January 1950, made Hyderabad State one of the part B states of India, with Hyderabad city continuing to be the capital. In his 1955 report &quot;Thoughts on Linguistic States&quot;, B. R. Ambedkar, then chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Indian Constitution, proposed designating the city of Hyderabad as the second capital of India because of its amenities and strategic central location.

On 1 November 1956 the states of India were reorganised by language. Hyderabad state was split into three parts, which were merged with neighbouring states to form Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The nine Telugu- and Urdu-speaking districts of Hyderabad State in the Telangana region were merged with the Telugu-speaking Andhra State to create Andhra Pradesh, with Hyderabad as its capital. Several protests, known collectively as the Telangana movement, attempted to invalidate the merger and demanded the creation of a new Telangana state. Major actions took place in 1969 and 1972, and a third began in 2010. On 30 July 2013 the government of India declared that part of Andhra Pradesh would be split off to form a new Telangana state and that Hyderabad city would be the capital city and part of Telangana, while the city would also remain the capital of Andhra Pradesh for no more than ten years. On 3 October 2013 the Union Cabinet approved the proposal, and in February 2014 both houses of Parliament passed the Telangana Bill. With the final assent of the President of India, Telangana state was formed on 2 June 2014.

== Geography ==
Hyderabad is south of Delhi, southeast of Mumbai, and north of Bangalore by road. It is situated in the southern part of Telangana in southeastern India, along the banks of the Musi River, a tributary of Krishna River located on the Deccan Plateau in the northern part of South India. Greater Hyderabad covers , making it one of the largest metropolitan areas in India. With an average altitude of , Hyderabad lies on predominantly sloping terrain of grey and pink granite, dotted with small hills, the highest being Banjara Hills at . The city has numerous lakes sometime referred to as &quot;sagar&quot;, meaning &quot;sea&quot;. Examples include artificial lakes created by dams on the Musi, such as Hussain Sagar (built-in 1562 near the city centre), Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar. , the city had 140 lakes and 834 water tanks (ponds).

=== Climate ===
Hyderabad has a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen &quot;Aw&quot;) bordering on a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSh&quot;). The annual mean temperature is ; monthly mean temperatures are . Summers (March–June) are hot and dry, with average highs in the mid-to-high 30s Celsius; maximum temperatures often exceed between April and June. The coolest temperatures occur in December and January when the lowest temperature occasionally dips to . May is the hottest month when daily temperatures range from ; December, the coldest, has temperatures varying from .

Heavy rain from the south-west summer monsoon falls between June and October, supplying Hyderabad with most of its mean annual rainfall. Since records began in November 1891, the heaviest rainfall recorded in a 24-hour period was on 24 August 2000. The highest temperature ever recorded was on 2 June 1966, and the lowest was on 8 January 1946. The city receives 2,731 hours of sunshine per year; maximum daily sunlight exposure occurs in February.

Hyderabad has been ranked 21st best &quot;National Clean Air City&quot; (under Category 1 &gt;10L Population cities) in India according to &#x27;Swachh Vayu Survekshan 2024 Results&#x27;

=== Conservation ===
Hyderabad&#x27;s lakes and the sloping terrain of its low-lying hills provide habitat for an assortment of flora and fauna. , the tree cover is 1.7% of the total city area, a decrease from 2.7% in 1996. The forest region in and around the city encompasses areas of ecological and biological importance, which are preserved in the form of national parks, zoos, mini-zoos and a wildlife sanctuary. Nehru Zoological Park, the city&#x27;s largest zoo, is the first in India to have a lion and tiger safari park. Hyderabad has three national parks (Mrugavani National Park, Mahavir Harina Vanasthali National Park and Kasu Brahmananda Reddy National Park), and the Manjira Wildlife Sanctuary is about from the city.

The other environmental reserves of Hyderabad are Kotla Vijayabhaskara Reddy Botanical Gardens, Ameenpur Lake, Shamirpet Lake, Hussain Sagar, Fox Sagar Lake, Mir Alam Tank and Patancheru Lake, which is home to regional birds and attracts seasonal migratory birds from different parts of the world. Organisations engaged in environmental and wildlife preservation include the Telangana Forest Department, Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education, the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), the Animal Welfare Board of India, the Blue Cross of Hyderabad and the University of Hyderabad.

== Administration ==
=== Common capital status ===

According to the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 part 2 Section 5: &quot;(1) On and from the appointed day, Hyderabad in the existing State of Andhra Pradesh, shall be the common capital of the State of Telangana and the State of Andhra Pradesh for such period not exceeding ten years. (2) After the expiry of the period referred to in subsection (1), Hyderabad shall be the capital of the State of Telangana and there shall be a new capital for the State of Andhra Pradesh.&quot;

The same sections also define that the common capital includes the existing area designated as the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation under the Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Act, 1955. As stipulated in sections 3 and 18(1) of the Reorganisation Act, city MLAs are members of the Telangana state assembly.

=== Local government ===
The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) oversees the civic infrastructure of the city, there are six administrative zones of GHMC: South Zone–(Charminar), East Zone–(L. B. Nagar), West Zone–(Serilingampally), North Zone–(Kukatpally), Northeast Zone–(Secunderabad) and Central Zone–(Khairatabad); these zones consist of 30 &quot;circles&quot;, which together encompass 150 municipal wards. Each ward is represented by a corporator, elected by popular vote, the city has 7,400,000 voters of which 3,850,000 are male and 3,500,000 are female. The corporators elect the Mayor, who is the titular head of GHMC; executive powers rest with the Municipal Commissioner, appointed by the state government. The GHMC carries out the city&#x27;s infrastructural work such as building and maintenance of roads and drains, town planning including construction regulation, maintenance of municipal markets and parks, solid waste management, the issuing of birth and death certificates, the issuing of trade licences, collection of property tax, and community welfare services such as mother and child healthcare, and pre-school and non-formal education. The GHMC was formed in April 2007 by merging the Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad (MCH) with 12 municipalities of the Hyderabad, Ranga Reddy and Medak districts covering a total area of . The Secunderabad Cantonment Board is a civic administration agency overseeing an area of , where there are several military camps. The Osmania University campus is administered independently by the university authority. Appointed in February 2021, Gadwal Vijayalakshmi of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is serving as the mayor of GHMC.

In Hyderabad police jurisdiction is divided into three commissionerates: Hyderabad (established in 1847 AD, the oldest police commissionerate in India ), Cyberabad, and Rachakonda, each headed by a commissioner of police, who are Indian Police Service (IPS) officers. The Hyderabad police is a division of the Telangana Police, under the state Home Ministry.

The jurisdictions of the city&#x27;s administrative agencies are, in ascending order of size: the Hyderabad Police area, Hyderabad district, the GHMC area (&quot;Hyderabad city&quot;), and the area under the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA). The HMDA is an apolitical urban planning agency that covers the GHMC and its suburbs, extending to 54 &quot;mandals&quot; in five districts encircling the city. It coordinates the development activities of GHMC and suburban municipalities and manages the administration of bodies such as the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWSSB).

Hyderabad is the seat of the Government of Telangana, Government of Andhra Pradesh and the President of India&#x27;s winter retreat Rashtrapati Nilayam, as well as the Telangana High Court and various local government agencies. The Lower City Civil Court and the Metropolitan Criminal Court are under the jurisdiction of the High Court. The GHMC area contains 24 State Legislative Assembly constituencies, which form five constituencies of the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the Parliament of India).

=== Utility services ===

The HMWSSB (Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply &amp; Sewage Board) regulates rainwater harvesting, sewerage services, and water supply. In 2005, the HMWSSB started operating a water supply pipeline from Nagarjuna Sagar Dam to meet increasing demand. The Telangana Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (TSPDCL) manages electricity supply. , there were 15 fire stations in the city, operated by the Telangana State Disaster and Fire Response Department. The government-owned India Post has five head post offices and many sub-post offices in Hyderabad, which are complemented by private courier services.

=== Pollution control ===
Hyderabad produces around 4,500 tonnes of solid waste daily, which is transported from collection units in Imlibun, Yousufguda and Lower Tank Bund to the dumpsite in Jawaharnagar. Disposal is managed by the Integrated Solid Waste Management project which was started by the GHMC in 2010. Rapid urbanisation and increased economic activity has led to increased industrial waste, air, noise and water pollution, which is regulated by the Telangana Pollution Control Board (TPCB). The contribution of different sources to air pollution in 2006 was: 20–50% from vehicles, 40–70% from a combination of vehicle discharge and road dust, 10–30% from industrial discharges and 3–10% from the burning of household rubbish. Deaths resulting from atmospheric particulate matter are estimated at 1,700–3,000 each year. The city&#x27;s &quot;VIP areas&quot;, the Assembly building, Secretariat, and Telangana chief minister&#x27;s office, have particularly low air quality index ratings, suffering from high levels of PM2.5&#x27;s. Ground water around Hyderabad, which has a hardness of up to 1000 ppm, around three times higher than is desirable, is the main source of drinking water but the increasing population and consequent increase in demand has led to a decline in not only ground water but also river and lake levels. This shortage is further exacerbated by inadequately treated affluent discharged from industrial treatment plants polluting the water sources of the city.

=== Healthcare ===
The Commissionerate of Health and Family Welfare is responsible for planning, implementation and monitoring of all facilities related to health and preventive services. –11, the city had 50 government hospitals, 300 private and charity hospitals and 194 nursing homes providing around 12,000 hospital beds, fewer than half the required 25,000. For every 10,000 people in the city, there are 17.6 hospital beds, 9 specialist doctors, 14 nurses and 6 physicians. The city has about 4,000 individual clinics. Private clinics are preferred by many residents because of the distance to, poor quality of care at and long waiting times in government facilities, despite the high proportion of the city&#x27;s residents being covered by government health insurance: 24% according to a National Family Health Survey in 2005. , many new private hospitals of various sizes were opened or being built. Hyderabad has outpatient and inpatient facilities that use Unani, homoeopathic and Ayurvedic treatments.

In the 2005 National Family Health Survey, it was reported that the city&#x27;s total fertility rate is 1.8, which is below the replacement rate. Only 61% of children had been provided with all basic vaccines (BCG, measles and full courses of polio and DPT), fewer than in all other surveyed cities except Meerut. The infant mortality rate was 35 per 1,000 live births, and the mortality rate for children under five was 41 per 1,000 live births. The survey also reported that a third of women and a quarter of men are overweight or obese, 49% of children below 5 years are anaemic, and up to 20% of children are underweight, while more than 2% of women and 3% of men suffer from diabetes.

== Demographics ==

When the GHMC was created in 2007, the area occupied by the municipality increased from to . Consequently, the population increased by 87%, from 3,637,483 census to 6,809,970 census, 24% of which are migrants from elsewhere in India, making Hyderabad the nation&#x27;s fourth most populous city. , the population density is and the Hyderabad urban agglomeration had a population of 7,749,334 making it the sixth most populous urban agglomeration in the country. census, there are 3,500,802 male and 3,309,168 female citizens—a sex ratio of 945 females per 1000 males, higher than the national average of 926 per 1000. Among children aged years, 373,794 are boys and 352,022 are girls—a ratio of 942 per 1000. Literacy stands at 83% (male 86%; female 80%), higher than the national average of 74.04%. The socio-economic strata consist of 20% upper class, 50% middle class and 30% working class.

=== Ethnicity ===

Hyderabadi Muslims are a unique community who owe much of their history, language, cuisine, and culture to Hyderabad, and the various dynasties who previously ruled. Hadhrami Arabs, African Arabs, Armenians, Abyssinians, Iranians, Pathans and Turkish people were present before 1948; these communities, of which the Hadhrami Arabs are the largest, declined after Hyderabad State became part of the Indian Union, as they lost the patronage of the Asaf Jahi Nizams.

== Cityscape ==
=== Neighbourhoods ===
The historic city established by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah on the southern side of the Musi River forms the heritage region of Hyderabad called the &quot;Purana Shahar&quot; (Old City), while the &quot;New City&quot; encompasses the urbanised area on the northern banks. The two are connected by many bridges across the river, the oldest of which is Purana Pul—(&quot;old bridge&quot;) built in 1578 AD. Hyderabad is twinned with neighbouring Secunderabad, to which it is connected by Hussain Sagar.
Many historic and heritage sites lie in south central Hyderabad, such as the Charminar, Mecca Masjid, Salar Jung Museum, Nizam Museum, Telangana High Court, Falaknuma Palace, Chowmahalla Palace and the traditional retail corridor comprising the Pearl Market, Laad Bazaar and Madina Circle. North of the river are hospitals, colleges, major railway stations and business areas such as Begum Bazaar, Koti, Abids, Sultan Bazar and Moazzam Jahi Market, along with administrative and recreational establishments such as the Reserve Bank of India, the Telangana Secretariat, the India Government Mint, the Telangana Legislature, the Public Gardens, Shahi Masjid, the Nizam Club, the Ravindra Bharathi, the State Museum, the Birla Temple and the Birla Planetarium.

North of central Hyderabad lies Hussain Sagar, Tank Bund Road, Rani Gunj and the Secunderabad railway station. Most of the city&#x27;s parks and recreational centres, such as Sanjeevaiah Park, Indira Park, Lumbini Park, NTR Gardens, the Buddha statue and Tankbund Park are located here. In the northwest part of the city there are upscale residential and commercial areas such as Banjara Hills, Jubilee Hills, Begumpet, Khairtabad, Tolichowki, Jagannath Temple and Miyapur. The northern end contains industrial areas such as Kukatpally, Sanathnagar, Moosapet, Balanagar, Patancheru and Chanda Nagar. The northeast end is dotted with residential areas such as Malkajgiri, Neredmet, A. S. Rao Nagar and Uppal. In the eastern part of the city lie many defence research centres and Ramoji Film City. The &quot;Cyberabad&quot; area in the southwest and west of the city, consisting of Madhapur and Gachibowli has grown rapidly since the 1990s. It is home to information technology and bio-pharmaceutical companies and to landmarks such as Hyderabad Airport, Osman Sagar, Himayath Sagar and Kasu Brahmananda Reddy National Park.

=== Landmarks ===
Heritage buildings constructed during the Qutb Shahi and Nizam eras showcase Indo-Islamic architecture influenced by Medieval, Mughal and European styles. After the 1908 flooding of the Musi River, the city was expanded and civic monuments constructed, particularly during the rule of Mir Osman Ali Khan (the VIIth Nizam), whose patronage of architecture led to him being referred to as the maker of modern Hyderabad. In 2012, the government of India declared Hyderabad the first &quot;Best heritage city of India&quot;.

Qutb Shahi architecture of the 16th and early 17th centuries followed classical Persian architecture featuring domes and colossal arches. The oldest surviving Qutb Shahi structure in Hyderabad is the ruins of the Golconda Fort built in the 16th century. Most of the historical bazaars that still exist were constructed on the street north of Charminar towards the fort. The Charminar has become an icon of the city; located in the centre of old Hyderabad, it is a square structure with sides long and four grand arches each facing a road. At each corner stands a -high minaret. The Charminar, Golconda Fort and the Qutb Shahi tombs are considered to be monuments of national importance in India; in 2010 the Indian government proposed that the sites be listed for UNESCO World Heritage status.

Among the oldest surviving examples of Nizam architecture in Hyderabad is the Chowmahalla Palace, which was the seat of royal power. It showcases a diverse array of architectural styles, from the Baroque Harem to its Neoclassical royal court. The other palaces include Falaknuma Palace (inspired by the style of Andrea Palladio), Purani Haveli, King Kothi Palace and Bella Vista Palace all of which were built at the peak of Nizam rule in the 19th century. During Mir Osman Ali Khan&#x27;s rule, European styles, along with Indo-Islamic, became prominent. These styles are reflected in the Indo-Saracenic style of architecture seen in many civic monuments such as the Hyderabad High Court, Osmania Hospital, City College and the Kacheguda railway station, all designed by Vincent Esch. Other landmark structures of the city constructed during his regin are the State Central Library, the Telangana Legislature, the State Archaeology Museum, Jubilee Hall, and Hyderabad railway station. Other landmarks of note are Paigah Palace, Asman Garh Palace, Basheer Bagh Palace, Errum Manzil and the Spanish Mosque, all constructed by the Paigah family.

Hyderabad&#x27;s role in the pearl trade has given it the name &quot;City of Pearls&quot; and up until the 18th century, the city was the only global trading centre for diamonds known as Golconda diamonds. Industrialisation began under the Nizams in the late 19th century, helped by railway expansion that connected the city with major ports. From the 1950s to the 1970s, Indian enterprises, such as Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), Nuclear Fuel Complex (NFC), National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC), Bharat Electronics (BEL), Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL), Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD), State Bank of Hyderabad (SBH) and Andhra Bank (AB) were established in the city. The city is home to Hyderabad Securities formerly known as Hyderabad Stock Exchange (HSE), and houses the regional office of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). In 2013, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) facility in Hyderabad was forecast to provide operations and transactions services to BSE-Mumbai by the end of 2014. The growth of the financial services sector has helped Hyderabad evolve from a traditional manufacturing city to a cosmopolitan industrial service centre. Since the 1990s, the growth of information technology (IT), IT-enabled services (ITES), insurance and financial institutions has expanded the service sector, and these primary economic activities have boosted the ancillary sectors of trade and commerce, transport, storage, communication, real estate and retail. , the IT exports from Hyderabad were 1,45,522 crore (19.66 billion), the city houses 1500 IT and TES companies that provide 628,615 jobs.
Hyderabad&#x27;s commercial markets are divided into four sectors: central business districts, sub-central business centres, neighbourhood business centres and local business centres. Many traditional and historic bazaars are located throughout the city, Laad Bazaar being the prominent among all is popular for selling a variety of traditional and cultural antique wares, along with gems and pearls.
The establishment of Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited (IDPL), a public sector undertaking, in 1961 was followed over the decades by many national and global companies opening manufacturing and research facilities in the city. , the city manufactured one third of India&#x27;s bulk drugs and 16% of biotechnology products, contributing to its reputation as &quot;India&#x27;s pharmaceutical capital&quot; and the &quot;Genome Valley of India&quot;. Hyderabad is a global centre of information technology, for which it is known as &quot;Cyberabad&quot; (Cyber City). , it contributed 15% of India&#x27;s and 98% of Andhra Pradesh&#x27;s exports in IT and ITES sectors and 22% of NASSCOM&#x27;s total membership is from the city. The development of HITEC City, a township with extensive technological infrastructure, prompted multinational companies to establish facilities in Hyderabad. The city is home to more than 1300 IT and ITES firms that provide employment for 407,000 individuals; the global conglomerates include Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google, IBM, Yahoo!, Oracle Corporation, Dell, Facebook, CISCO, and major Indian firms including Tech Mahindra, Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Polaris, Cyient and Wipro. In 2009 the World Bank Group ranked the city as the second best Indian city for doing business. The city and its suburbs contain the highest number of special economic zones of any Indian city.

The Automotive industry in Hyderabad is also emerging and making it an automobile hub. Automobile companies including as Hyundai, Hyderabad Allwyn, Praga Tools, HMT Bearings, Ordnance Factory Medak, Deccan Auto and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra have units in the Hyderabad economic zone. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Maruti Suzuki and Triton Energy will invest in Hyderabad.

Like the rest of India, Hyderabad has a large informal economy that employs 30% of the labour force. According to a survey published in 2007, it had 40–50,000 street vendors, and their numbers were increasing. Among the street vendors, 84% are male and 16% female, and four fifths are &quot;stationary vendors&quot; operating from a fixed pitch, often with their own stall. Most are financed through personal savings; only 8% borrow from moneylenders. Vendor earnings vary from to per day. Other unorganised economic sectors include dairy, poultry farming, brick manufacturing, casual labour and domestic help. Those involved in the informal economy constitute a major portion of the urban poor.

In 2024, the World Economic Forum established a Centre for Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR), in the city. Which it describes as a hub to leverage the latest technology in advancing the life sciences and health sectors.

== Culture ==
Hyderabad emerged as the foremost centre of culture in India with the decline of the Mughal Empire. After the fall of Delhi in 1857, the migration of performing artists to the city particularly from the north and west of the Indian subcontinent, under the patronage of the Nizam, enriched the cultural milieu. This migration resulted in a mingling of North and South Indian languages, cultures and religions, which has since led to a co-existence of Hindu and Muslim traditions, for which the city has become noted. A further consequence of this north–south mix is that both Telugu and Urdu are official languages of Telangana. The mixing of religions has resulted in many festivals being celebrated in Hyderabad such as Ganesh Chaturthi, Diwali and Bonalu of Hindu tradition and Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha by Muslims.

Traditional Hyderabadi garb reveals a mix of Muslim and Hindu influences with men wearing &quot;sherwani&quot; and &quot;kurta–paijama&quot; and women wearing &quot;khara dupatta&quot; and &quot;salwar kameez&quot;. Most Muslim women wear &quot;burqa&quot; and &quot;hijab&quot; outdoors. In addition to the traditional Hindu and Muslim garments, increasing exposure to western cultures has led to a rise in the wearing of western style clothing among youths.

=== Literature ===
In the past, Qutb Shahi rulers and Asaf Jahi Nizams attracted artists, architects, and men of letters from different parts of the world through patronage. The resulting ethnic mix popularised cultural events such as &quot;mushairas&quot; (poetic symposia), &quot;Qawwali&quot; (devotional songs) and &quot;Dholak ke Geet&quot; (traditional folk songs). The Qutb Shahi dynasty particularly encouraged the growth of Deccani literature leading to works such as the &quot;Deccani Masnavi&quot; and &quot;Diwan poetry&quot;, which are among the earliest available manuscripts in Urdu. &quot;Lazzat Un Nisa&quot;, a book compiled in the 15th century at Qutb Shahi courts, contains erotic paintings with diagrams for secret medicines and stimulants in the eastern form of ancient sexual arts. The reign of the Asaf Jahi Nizams saw many literary reforms and the introduction of Urdu as a language of court, administration and education. In 1824, a collection of Urdu &quot;Ghazal&quot; poetry, named &quot;Gulzar-e-Mahlaqa&quot;, authored by Mah Laqa Bai—the first female Urdu poet to produce a Diwan—was published in Hyderabad. Hyderabad has continued with these traditions in its annual Hyderabad Literary Festival, held since 2010, showcasing the city&#x27;s literary and cultural creativity. Organisations engaged in the advancement of literature include the Sahitya Akademi, the Urdu Academy, the Telugu Academy, the National Council for Promotion of Urdu Language, the Comparative Literature Association of India, and the Andhra Saraswata Parishad. Literary development is further aided by state institutions such as the State Central Library, the largest public library in the state which was established in 1891, and other major libraries including the Sri Krishna Devaraya Andhra Bhasha Nilayam, the British Library and the Sundarayya Vignana Kendram.
=== Music and films ===

South Indian music and dances such as the Kuchipudi and Bharatanatyam styles are popular in the Deccan region. As a result of their cultural policies, North Indian music and dance gained popularity during the rule of the Mughals and Nizams, and it was also during their reign that it became a tradition among the nobility to associate themselves with tawaif (courtesans). These courtesans were revered as the epitome of etiquette and culture and were appointed to teach singing, poetry, and classical dance to many children of the aristocracy. This gave rise to certain styles of court music, dance and poetry. Besides western and Indian popular music genres such as filmi music, the residents of Hyderabad play city-based &quot;marfa music&quot;, &quot;Dholak ke Geet&quot; (household songs based on local folklore), and qawwali, especially at weddings, festivals and other celebratory events. The state government organises the Golconda Music and Dance Festival, the Taramati Music Festival and the Premavathi Dance Festival to further encourage the development of music.

Although the city is not particularly noted for theatre and drama, the state government promotes theatre with multiple programmes and festivals in such venues as the Ravindra Bharathi, Shilpakala Vedika, Lalithakala Thoranam and Lamakaan. Although not a purely music-oriented event, Numaish, a popular annual exhibition of local and national consumer products, does feature some musical performances.

The city is home to the Telugu film industry, popularly known as Tollywood— it is the highest-grossing Indian film industry. In the 1970s, Deccani language realist films by globally acclaimed Shyam Benegal started a movement of coming of age art films in India, which came to be known as parallel cinema. The Deccani film industry (&quot;Dollywood&quot;) produces films in the local Hyderabadi dialect, which have gained regional popularity since 2005. The city has hosted international film festivals such as the International Children&#x27;s Film Festival and the Hyderabad International Film Festival. In 2005, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; declared Ramoji Film City to be the world&#x27;s largest film studio.

=== Art and handicrafts ===
The region is well known for its Golconda and Hyderabad painting styles which are branches of Deccan painting. Developed during the 16th century, the Golconda style is a native style blending foreign techniques and bears some similarity to the Vijayanagara paintings of neighbouring Mysore. A significant use of luminous gold and white colours is generally found in the Golconda style. The Hyderabad style originated in the 17th century under the Nizams. Highly influenced by Mughal painting, this style makes use of bright colours and mostly depicts regional landscape, culture, costumes, and jewellery.

Although not a centre for handicrafts itself, the patronage of the arts by the Mughals and Nizams attracted artisans from the region to Hyderabad. Such crafts include: Wootz steel, Filigree work, Bidriware, a metalwork handicraft from neighbouring Karnataka, which was popularised during the 18th century and has since been granted a Geographical Indication (GI) tag under the auspices of the WTO act; and Zari and Zardozi, embroidery works on textile that involve making elaborate designs using gold, silver and other metal threads. Chintz—a glazed calico textiles was originated in Golconda in 16th century. and another example of a handicraft drawn to Hyderabad is Kalamkari, a hand-painted or block-printed cotton textile that comes from cities in Andhra Pradesh. This craft is distinguished in having both a Hindu style, known as Srikalahasti and entirely done by hand, and an Islamic style, known as Machilipatnam which uses both hand and block techniques. Examples of Hyderabad&#x27;s arts and crafts are housed in various museums including the Salar Jung Museum (housing &quot;one of the largest one-man-collections in the world&quot;), the Telangana State Archaeology Museum, the Nizam Museum, the City Museum and the Birla Science Museum.

Hyderabadi &quot;biryani&quot; and Hyderabadi &quot;haleem&quot;, with their blend of Mughlai and Arab cuisines, carry the national Geographical Indications tag. Hyderabadi cuisine is influenced to some extent by French, but more by Arabic, Turkish, Iranian and native Telugu and Marathwada cuisines. Popular native dishes include &quot;nihari&quot;, &quot;chakna&quot;, &quot;baghara baingan&quot; and the desserts &quot;qubani ka meetha&quot;, &quot;double ka meetha&quot; and &quot;kaddu ki kheer&quot; (a sweet porridge made with sweet gourd).
