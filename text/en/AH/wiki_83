<text>Malayalam (; , ) is a Dravidian language spoken in the Indian state of Kerala and the union territories of Lakshadweep and Puducherry (Mahé district) by the Malayali people. It is one of 22 scheduled languages of India. Malayalam was designated a &quot;Classical Language of India&quot; in 2013. Malayalam has official language status in Kerala, Lakshadweep and Puducherry (Mahé), and is also the primary spoken language of Lakshadweep. Malayalam is spoken by 35 million people in India.
Malayalam is also spoken by linguistic minorities in the neighbouring states; with a significant number of speakers in the Kodagu and Dakshina Kannada districts of Karnataka, and Kanyakumari, Coimbatore and Nilgiris district of Tamil Nadu. It is also spoken by the Malayali Diaspora worldwide, especially in the Persian Gulf countries, due to the large populations of Malayali expatriates there. They are a significant population in each city in India including Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad etc.

The origin of Malayalam remains a matter of dispute among scholars. The mainstream view holds that Malayalam descends from a western coastal dialect of early Middle Tamil and separated from it sometime between the 9th and 13th centuries. This western dialect also preserved some archaisms suggesting an earlier divergence of the spoken dialects in the prehistoric period. A second view argues for the development of the two languages out of &quot;Proto-Dravidian&quot; or &quot;Proto-Tamil-Malayalam&quot; either in the prehistoric period or in the middle of the first millennium A.D., although this is generally rejected by historical linguists. The Quilon Syrian copper plates of 849/850 CE are considered by some to be the oldest available inscription written in Old Malayalam. However, the existence of Old Malayalam is sometimes disputed by scholars. They regard the Chera Perumal inscriptional language as a diverging dialect or variety of contemporary Tamil. The oldest extant literary work in Malayalam distinct from the Tamil tradition is &quot;Ramacharitam&quot; (late 12th or early 13th century).

The earliest script used to write Malayalam was the Vatteluttu script. The current Malayalam script is based on the Vatteluttu script, which was extended with Grantha script letters to adopt Indo-Aryan loanwords. It bears high similarity with the Tigalari script, a historical script that was used to write the Tulu language in South Canara, and Sanskrit in the adjacent Malabar region. The modern Malayalam grammar is based on the book &quot;Kerala Panineeyam&quot; written by A. R. Raja Raja Varma in late 19th century CE. The first travelogue in any Indian language is the Malayalam &quot;Varthamanappusthakam&quot;, written by Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar in 1785.

Robert Caldwell describes the extent of Malayalam in the 19th century as extending from the vicinity of Kumbla in the north where it supersedes with Tulu to Kanyakumari in the south, where it begins to be superseded by Tamil, beside the inhabited islands of Lakshadweep in the Arabian Sea.

== Etymology ==
In a 7th-century poem written by the Tamil poet Sambandar the people of Kerala are referred to as &quot;malaiyāḷar&quot; (mountain people). The word is also said to originate from the words , meaning &#x27;mountain&#x27;, and , meaning &#x27;region&#x27; or &#x27;-ship&#x27; (as in &quot;township&quot;); thus translates directly as &#x27;the mountain region&#x27;. The term &quot;Malabar&quot; was used as an alternative term for &quot;Malayalam&quot; in foreign trade circles to denote the southwestern coast of the Indian peninsula, which also means &quot;The land of hills&quot;. The term originally referred to the western hilly land of the Chera dynasty (later Zamorins and the Kingdom of Cochin), Kingdom of Ezhimala (later Kolathunadu), and Ay kingdom (later Travancore), and only later became the name of its language. The language Malayalam was alternatively called , , , , , , , and until the early 19th century CE.

The earliest extant literary works in the regional language of present-day Kerala probably date back to as early as the 12th century. At that time, the language was differentiated by the name &quot;Kerala Bhasha&quot;. The earliest mention of Malayalam as a language is found outside of Kerala in the 15th century Telugu work Śrībhīmēśvarapurāṇamu by Śrīnātha. The distinctive &quot;Malayalam&quot; named identity of this language appears to have come into existence in Kerala only around the 16th century, when it was known as &quot;Malayayma&quot; or &quot;Malayanma&quot;; the words were also used to refer to the script and the region. According to Duarte Barbosa, a Portuguese visitor who visited Kerala in the early 16th century CE, the people in the southwestern Malabar coast of India from Kumbla in north to Kanyakumari in south had a unique language, which was called &quot;Maliama&quot; by them.

Prior to this period, the people of Kerala usually referred to their language as &quot;Tamil&quot;, and both terms overlapped into the colonial period.

== History ==
Due to the geographical isolation of the Malabar Coast from the rest of the Indian peninsula due to the presence of the Western Ghats mountain ranges which lie parallel to the coast, the dialect of Old Tamil spoken in Kerala was different from that spoken in Tamil Nadu. The mainstream view holds that Malayalam began to grow as a distinct literary language from the western coastal dialect of Middle Tamil and the linguistic separation completed sometime between the 9th and 13th centuries. The renowned poets of Classical Tamil such as Paranar (1st century CE), Ilango Adigal (2nd–3rd century CE), and Kulasekhara Alvar (9th century CE) were Keralites. The Sangam works can be considered as the ancient predecessor of Malayalam.

Some scholars however believe that both Tamil and Malayalam developed during the prehistoric period from a common ancestor, &quot;Proto-Tamil-Malayalam&quot;, and that the notion of Malayalam being a &quot;daughter&quot; of Tamil is misplaced. This is based on the fact that Malayalam and several Dravidian languages on the Western Coast have common archaic features which are not found even in the oldest historical forms of literary Tamil. Despite this, Malayalam shares many common innovations with Tamil that emerged during the early Middle Tamil period, thus making independent descent impossible. For example, Old Tamil lacks the first and second person plural pronouns with the ending &#x27;. It is in the Early Middle Tamil stage that &#x27; first appears:

Indeed, most features of Malayalam morphology are derivable from a form of speech corresponding to early Middle Tamil.

Robert Caldwell, in his 1856 book &quot;A Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian Family of Languages&quot;, opined that literary Malayalam branched from &quot;Classical Tamil&quot; and over time gained a large amount of Sanskrit vocabulary and lost the personal terminations of verbs. As the language of scholarship and administration, Old-Tamil, which was written in Tamil-Brahmi and the Vatteluttu alphabet later, greatly influenced the early development of Malayalam as a literary language. The Malayalam script began to diverge from the &quot;Vatteluttu&quot; and the Western Grantha scripts in the 8th and 9th centuries of Common Era. By the end of the 13th century, a written form of the language emerged which was unique from the &quot;Vatteluttu&quot; script that was used to write Tamil on the eastern coast.

=== Old Malayalam ===
Old Malayalam (), an inscriptional language found in Kerala from circa 9th to circa 13th century CE, is the earliest attested form of Malayalam. The beginning of the development of Old Malayalam from a western coastal dialect of Middle Tamil can be dated to circa 8th century CE. It remained a west coast dialect until circa 9th century CE or a little later. The origin of Malayalam calendar dates back to year 825 CE. It is generally agreed that the western coastal dialect of Tamil began to separate, diverge, and grow as a distinct language due to geographical separation of Kerala from the Tamil country and the influence of Sanskrit and Prakrit from the Nambudiri Brahmins of the Malabar Coast.

The Old Malayalam language was employed in several official records and transactions (at the level of the Chera Perumal kings, as well as the upper-caste (Nambudiri) village temples). Most of the inscriptions in Old Malayalam were found from the northern districts of Kerala, those lie adjacent to Tulu Nadu. Old Malayalam was mostly written in Vatteluttu script (with Pallava/Southern Grantha characters). Old Malayalam had several features distinct from the contemporary Tamil, which include the nasalisation of adjoining sounds, substitution of palatal sounds for dental sounds, contraction of vowels, and the rejection of gender verbs. &quot;Ramacharitam&quot; and &quot;Thirunizhalmala&quot; are the possible literary works of Old Malayalam found so far.

=== Middle Malayalam ===
Old Malayalam gradually developed into Middle Malayalam (&quot;Madhyakaala Malayalam&quot;) by the 13th century CE. Malayalam literature also completely diverged from Tamil literature during this period. Works including &quot;Unniyachi Charitham&quot;, &quot;Unnichiruthevi Charitham&quot;, and &quot;Unniyadi Charitham&quot;, are written in Middle Malayalam, and date back to the 13th and 14th centuries of the Common Era. The &quot;Sandesha Kavya&quot;s of 14th century CE written in Manipravalam language include &quot;Unnuneeli Sandesam&quot;. &quot;Kannassa Ramayanam&quot; and &quot;Kannassa Bharatham&quot; by &quot;Rama Panikkar&quot; of the Niranam poets who lived between 1350 and 1450, are representative of this language. Ulloor has opined that Rama Panikkar holds the same position in Malayalam literature that Edmund Spenser does in English literature. The &quot;Champu Kavyas&quot; written by Punam Nambudiri, one among the &quot;Pathinettara Kavikal&quot; (Eighteen and a half poets) in the court of the Zamorin of Calicut, also belong to Middle Malayalam. The literary works of this period were heavily influenced by Manipravalam, which was a combination of contemporary Tamil and Sanskrit. The word &quot;Mani-Pravalam&quot; literally means &quot;Diamond-Coral&quot; or &quot;Ruby-Coral&quot;. The 14th-century &quot;Lilatilakam&quot; text states Manipravalam to be a &quot;Bhashya&quot; (language) where &quot;Dravida and Sanskrit should combine together like ruby and coral, without the least trace of any discord&quot;. The scripts of &quot;Kolezhuthu&quot; and &quot;Malayanma&quot; were also used to write Middle Malayalam. In addition to &quot;Vatteluthu&quot; and Grantha script, those were used to write Old Malayalam. The literary works written in Middle Malayalam were heavily influenced by Sanskrit and Prakrit, while comparing them with the modern Malayalam literature.
=== Modern Malayalam ===
The Middle Malayalam was succeeded by Modern Malayalam (&quot;Aadhunika Malayalam&quot;) by 15th century CE. The poem &quot;Krishnagatha&quot; written by Cherusseri Namboothiri, who was the court poet of the king Udaya Varman Kolathiri (1446–1475) of Kolathunadu, is written in modern Malayalam. The language used in &quot;Krishnagatha&quot; is the modern spoken form of Malayalam. During the 16th century CE, Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan from the Kingdom of Tanur and Poonthanam Nambudiri from the Kingdom of Valluvanad, followed the new trend initiated by Cherussery in their poems. The &quot;Adhyathmaramayanam Kilippattu&quot; and &quot;Mahabharatham Kilippattu,&quot; written by Ezhuthachan, and &quot;Jnanappana,&quot; written by Poonthanam, are also included in the earliest form of Modern Malayalam.

Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan is also credited with developing the Malayalam script into the current form through the intermixing and modification of the erstwhile scripts of &quot;Vatteluttu&quot;, &quot;Kolezhuthu&quot;, and Grantha script, which were used to write the inscriptions and literary works of Old and Middle Malayalam. He further eliminated excess and unnecessary letters from the modified script. Hence, Ezhuthachan is also known as &quot;The Father of modern Malayalam&quot;. The development of modern Malayalam script was also heavily influenced by the Tigalari script, which was used to write Sanskrit, due to the influence of Tuluva Brahmins in Kerala. The language used in the Arabi Malayalam works of the 16th–17th century CE is a mixture of Modern Malayalam and Arabic. They follow the syntax of modern Malayalam, though written in a modified form of Arabic script, which is known as Arabi Malayalam script. P. Shangunny Menon ascribes the authorship of the medieval work &quot;Keralolpathi&quot;, which describes the Parashurama legend and the departure of the final Cheraman Perumal king to Mecca, to Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan.

Kunchan Nambiar introduced a new literary form called &quot;Thullal&quot;, and Unnayi Variyar introduced reforms in &quot;Attakkatha literature&quot;. The printing, prose literature, and Malayalam journalism, developed after the latter-half of the 18th century CE. Modern literary movements in Malayalam literature began in the late 19th century with the rise of the famous Modern Triumvirate consisting of Kumaran Asan, Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer and Vallathol Narayana Menon. In the second half of the 20th century, Jnanpith winning poets and writers like G. Sankara Kurup, S. K. Pottekkatt, Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai, M. T. Vasudevan Nair, O. N. V. Kurup, and Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri, had made valuable contributions to the modern Malayalam literature. The life and works of Edasseri Govindan Nair have assumed greater socio-literary significance after his death and Edasseri is now recognised as an important poet of Malayalam. Later, writers like O. V. Vijayan, Kamaladas, M. Mukundan, Arundhati Roy, and Vaikom Muhammed Basheer, have gained international recognition. Malayalam has also borrowed a lot of its words from various foreign languages: mainly from the Semitic languages including Arabic, and the European languages including Dutch and Portuguese, due to the long heritage of Indian Ocean trade and the Portuguese-Dutch colonization of the Malabar Coast.

== Dialects ==
Variations in intonation patterns, vocabulary, and distribution of grammatical and phonological elements are observable along the parameters of region, religion, community, occupation, social stratum, style and register.

According to the Dravidian Encyclopedia, the regional dialects of Malayalam can be divided into fifteen dialect areas. They are as follows:

* Kasaragod
* North Malabar
* Wayanad
* Kozhikode
* Eranad
* Valluvanad (South Malabar)
* Palakkad
* Thrissur-Kochi
* North Travancore
* West Vembanad
* Central Travancore
* South Travancore
* Lakshadweep
* Beary
* Ravula
According to Ethnologue, the dialects are: Malabar, Nagari-Malayalam, North Kerala, Central Kerala, South Kerala, Kayavar, Namboodiri, Nair, Mappila, Beary, Jeseri, Yerava, Pulaya, Nasrani, and Kasargod. The community dialects are: Namboodiri, Nair, Arabi Malayalam, Pulaya, and Nasrani. Whereas both the Namboothiri and Nair dialects have a common nature, the Arabi Malayalam is among the most divergent of dialects, differing considerably from literary Malayalam. Jeseri is a dialect of Malayalam spoken mainly in the Union territory of Lakshadweep and Beary is spoken in Tulu Nadu which are nearer to Kerala. Of the total 33,066,392 Malayalam speakers in India in 2001, 33,015,420 spoke the standard dialects, 19,643 spoke the &quot;Yerava&quot; dialect and 31,329 spoke non-standard regional variations like &quot;Eranadan&quot;.

The dialects of Malayalam spoken in the districts like Kasaragod, Kannur, Wayanad, Kozhikode, and Malappuram in the former Malabar District have few influences from Kannada. For example, the words those start with the sound &quot;V&quot; in Malayalam become &quot;B&quot; in these districts as in Kannada. Also the Voiced retroflex approximant (/ɻ/) which is seen in both Tamil and the standard form of Malayalam, are not seen in the northern dialects of Malayalam, as in Kannada. For example, the words &quot;Vazhi&quot; (Path), &quot;Vili&quot; (Call), &quot;Vere&quot; (Another), and &quot;Vaa&quot; (Come/Mouth), become &quot;Bayi&quot;, &quot;Bili&quot;, &quot;Bere&quot;, and &quot;Baa&quot; in the northern dialects of Malayalam. Similarly the Malayalam spoken in the southern districts of Kerala, i.e., Thiruvananthapuram-Kollam-Pathanamthitta area is influenced by Tamil.

Labels such as &quot;Nampoothiri Dialect&quot;, &quot;Mappila Dialect&quot;, and &quot;Nasrani Dialect&quot; refer to overall patterns constituted by the sub-dialects spoken by the subcastes or sub-groups of each such caste. The most outstanding features of the major communal dialects of Malayalam are summarized below:
* Lexical items with phonological features reminiscent of Sanskrit (e.g., meaning &#x27;fool&#x27;), &#x27;lie&#x27;, &#x27;impudence&#x27;, &#x27;impurity&#x27;, and and (both meaning &#x27;good-for-nothing fellow&#x27;) abound in Nampoothiri dialect.
* The Muslim dialect, also known as Arabi Malayalam, shows maximum divergence from the literary Standard Dialect of Malayalam. It is very much influenced by Arabic and Persian rather than by Sanskrit or by English. The retroflex continuant of the literary dialect is realised in the Muslim dialect as the palatal . In some other dialects of Northern Kerala too, of the literary dialect is realised as .
* The Syrian Christian or Nasrani dialect of Malayalam is quite close to the Nair dialect, especially in phonology. The speech of the educated section among Syrian Christians and that of those who are close to the church are peculiar in having a number of assimilated as well as unassimilated loan words from English and Syriac. The few loan words which have found their way into the Christian dialect are assimilated in many cases through the process of de-aspiration.
* The Ravula is a tribal dialect of Malayalam spoken by the members of Ravula, an indigenous people&#x27;s tribe who are primarily inhabitants of the Kodagu district of Karnataka.
* Tamil spoken in the Kanyakumari district has influences from Malayalam language.

=== External influences and loanwords ===
Malayalam has incorporated many elements from other languages over the years, the most notable of these being Sanskrit and later, English. According to Sooranad Kunjan Pillai who compiled the authoritative Malayalam lexicon, the other principal languages whose vocabulary was incorporated over the ages were Arabic, Dutch, Hindustani, Pali, Persian, Portuguese, Prakrit, and Syriac.

* Many medieval liturgical texts were written in an admixture of Sanskrit and early Malayalam, called Manipravalam. The influence of Sanskrit was very prominent in formal Malayalam used in the medieval literature. Malayalam has a substantially high number of Sanskrit loanwords but these are seldom used.
* Some Arabic loanwords like &quot;adālattŭ&quot; (court of justice), &quot;jāmyaṃ&quot; (bail), &quot;japti&quot; (foreclosure), &quot;jilla&quot; (district), &quot;tālukkŭ&quot; (subdistrict), etc., are used in the formal literary Malayalam for administrative purposes.
* Loanwords and influences also from Hebrew, Syriac, and Ladino abound in the Jewish Malayalam dialects, as well as English, Portuguese, Syriac, and Greek in the Christian dialects, while Arabic and Persian elements predominate in the Muslim dialects.
* The Muslim dialect known as Mappila Malayalam is predominantly in the northern districts of Kerala. Another Muslim dialect called Beary bashe is used in the extreme northern part of Kerala along with the southern part of Karnataka in a former region called Tulu Nadu.

== Geographic distribution and population ==
Malayalam is a language spoken by the native people of southwestern India and the islands of Lakshadweep in the Arabian Sea. According to the Indian census of 2011, there were 32,413,213 speakers of Malayalam in Kerala, making up 93.2% of the total number of Malayalam speakers in India, and 97.03% of the total population of the state. There were a further 701,673 (1.14% of the total number) in Karnataka, 957,705 (2.70%) in Tamil Nadu, and 406,358 (1.2%) in Maharashtra.

The number of Malayalam speakers in Lakshadweep is 51,100, which is only 0.15% of the total number, but is as much as about 84% of the population of Lakshadweep. Malayalam was the most spoken language in erstwhile Gudalur taluk (now Gudalur and Panthalur taluks) of Nilgiris district in Tamil Nadu which accounts for 48.8% population and it was the second most spoken language in Mangalore and Puttur taluks of South Canara accounting for 21.2% and 15.4% respectively according to 1951 census report. 25.57% of the total population in the Kodagu district of Karnataka are Malayalis, and they form the single largest linguistic group accounting for 35.5% in the Virajpet Taluk. Around one-third of the Malayalis in Kodagu district speak the Yerava dialect according to the 2011 census, which is native to Kodagu and Wayanad.

In all, Malayalis made up 3.22% of the total Indian population in 2011. Of the total 34,713,130 Malayalam speakers in India in 2011, 33,015,420 spoke the standard dialects, 19,643 spoke the &quot;Yerava&quot; dialect and 31,329 spoke non-standard regional variations like &quot;Eranadan&quot;. As per the 1991 census data, 28.85% of all Malayalam speakers in India spoke a second language and 19.64% of the total knew three or more languages.

Just before independence, Malaya attracted many Malayalis. Large numbers of Malayalis have settled in Chennai, Bengaluru, Mangaluru, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Pune, Mysuru and Delhi. Many Malayalis have also emigrated to the Middle East, the United States, and Europe. There were 179,860 speakers of Malayalam in the United States, according to the 2000 census, with the highest concentrations in Bergen County, New Jersey, and Rockland County, New York. There are 144,000 of Malayalam speakers in Malaysia. There were 11,687 Malayalam speakers in Australia in 2016. The 2001 Canadian census reported 7,070 people who listed Malayalam as their mother tongue, mainly in Toronto. The 2006 New Zealand census reported 2,139 speakers. 134 Malayalam speaking households were reported in 1956 in Fiji. There is also a considerable Malayali population in the Persian Gulf regions, especially in Dubai, Kuwait and Doha.

== Phonology ==

For the consonants and vowels, the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) symbol is given, followed by the Malayalam character and the ISO 15919 transliteration. The current Malayalam script bears high similarity with Tigalari script, which was used for writing the Tulu language, spoken in coastal Karnataka (Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts) and the northernmost Kasargod district of Kerala. Tigalari script was also used for writing Sanskrit in Malabar region.

=== Vowels ===

*⟨⟩ formed from word final short /u/&#x27;s but now there are /u/&#x27;s finally as well, mostly in loanwords but also natively like in &quot;guru&quot;, &quot;kuru&quot;, &quot;puẓu&quot; and native &quot;pērŭ&quot;, there are minimal pairs as well &quot;appŭ&quot; &quot;water&quot;, &quot;appu&quot; a given name; It is also added to the end of loanwords ending in some consonants, e.g. Sanskrit &quot;manas&quot;, &quot;suhr̥t&quot;, Malayalam &quot;manassŭ&quot;, &quot;suhr̥ttŭ&quot;, English &quot;current&quot; Ml. &quot;karaṇṭŭ&quot;. It is the , an epenthentic vowel in Malayalam. Therefore, it has no independent vowel letter (because it never occurs at the beginning of words) but, when it comes after a consonant, there are various ways of representing it. In medieval times, it was just represented with the symbol for ⟨⟩, but later on it was just completely omitted (that is, written as an inherent vowel ⟨⟩, thus, ⟨⟩ &quot;pērŭ&quot; &quot;name&quot; was once written as ⟨⟩ &quot;pēra&quot; which means &quot;guava&quot;). In modern times, it is written in two different ways – the Northern style, in which a chandrakkala is used ⟨⟩, and the Southern or Travancore style, in which the diacritic for a is attached to the preceding consonant and a chandrakkala is written above ⟨⟩. According to one author, this alternative form ⟨⟩ is historically more correct, though the simplified form without a vowel sign &quot;u&quot; is common nowadays.
* (phonetically central: ) is represented as basic or the &quot;default&quot; vowel in the abugida script.

Malayalam has also borrowed the Sanskrit diphthongs of (represented in Malayalam as , ai) and (represented in Malayalam as , au) although these mostly occur only in Sanskrit loanwords. Traditionally (as in Sanskrit), four vocalic consonants (usually pronounced in Malayalam as consonants followed by the , which is not officially a vowel, and not as actual vocalic consonants) have been classified as vowels: vocalic r (, , r̥), long vocalic r (, , r̥̄), vocalic l (, , l̥) and long vocalic l (, , l̥̄). Except for the first, the other three have been omitted from the current script used in Kerala as there are no words in current Malayalam that use them.

Some authors say that Malayalam has no diphthongs and /ai̯, au̯/ are clusters of V+glide j/ʋ while others consider all V+glide clusters to be diphthongs /ai̯, aːi̯, au̯, ei̯, oi̯, i̯a/ as in &quot;kai, vāypa, auṣadhaṁ, cey, koy&quot; and &quot;kāryaṁ&quot;

Vowel length is phonemic and all of the vowels have minimal pairs for example &quot;kaṭṭi&quot; &quot;thickness&quot;, &quot;kāṭṭi&quot; &quot;showed&quot;, &quot;koṭṭi&quot; &quot;tapped&quot;, &quot;kōṭṭi&quot; &quot;twisted, stick, marble&quot;, &quot;er̠i&quot; &quot;throw&quot;, &quot;ēr̠i&quot; &quot;lots&quot;

Some speakers also have /æː/, /ɔː/, /ə/ from English loanwords e.g. /bæːŋgɨ̆/ &quot;bank&quot; but most speakers replace it with /aː/, /eː/ or /ja/; /oː/ or /aː/ and /e/ or /a/. 

=== Consonants ===

* As in other Dravidian languages, the retroflex series are true subapical consonants, in which the underside of the tongue contacts the roof.
* All of the alveolars except /s/ are apical.
* /, , , , / can either be postalveolar or alveolo-palatal depending upon the speaker and dialect; the postalveolar and alveolo-palatal realizations are in free variation.
* The alveolar nasal once had a separate character ⟨ഩ⟩ that is now obsolete and the sound is now almost always represented by the symbol that was originally used only for the dental nasal. However, both sounds are extensively used in current colloquial and official Malayalam, and although they were allophones in Old Malayalam, they now occasionally contrast in gemination – for example, (&#x27;by me&#x27;, first person singular pronoun in the instrumental case) and (&#x27;if that is so&#x27;), which are both written (എന്നാൽ) and tiṉṉŭ &quot;eat!&quot;, tinnŭ &quot;ate&quot;.
* The unaspirated alveolar stop also had a separate character ⟨ഺ⟩ but it has become obsolete, as the sound only occurs in geminate form (when geminated it is written with a below another ⟨റ്റ⟩) or immediately following other consonants (in these cases, or are usually written in small size underneath the first consonant).
*The proto Dravidian alveolar stop &quot;*ṯ&quot; developed into an alveolar trill /r/ in many of the Dravidian languages and &quot;*ṉṯ&quot; became &quot;nn&quot; in Malayalam while &quot;*ṯṯ&quot; remained. Currently Malayalam only has [nd] in the genitive case ending &quot;-ṉṟe&quot; and a word formed with it &quot;taṉṟēṭam&quot;; Malayalam regained it from the older genitive case ending &quot;-ṉuṭaiya &gt; -ṉuṭe &gt; -ṉṭe &gt; -ṉṟe&quot;, Malayalam still retains both forms in words like eṉṉuṭe and eṉṟe though the former is dated, a similar process happened in some Sri Lankan Tamil dialects.
* ന്റ is pronounced as [nd] but ൻറ can be pronounced as [nd] or [nr]; [nr] doesn&#x27;t occur natively but it occurs in loans like എൻറോൾ (&quot;en̠r̠ōḷ&quot;) &#x27;enroll&#x27; or ഹെൻറി (&quot;hen̠r̠i&quot;) &#x27;Henry&#x27;.
* All non geminated voiceless stops and affricate become voiced intervocalically and after a nasal as in Tamil.
* The geminated velars /kk/ and /ŋŋ/ are sometimes palatalized word medially after /j, i(:), e(:)/ like in the words [kiɖɐk:ugɐ] vs [iɾikʲ:ugɐ] and [mɐŋ:ɐl] vs. [mɐt̪:ɐŋʲ:ɐ], their distribution is unpredictable e.g. it doesn&#x27;t palatalize in vikkŭ but does in irikkŭ. If the palatalization is from /j/ it is sometimes deleted e.g. poykko can be [pojkʲːo] or [pokʲːo], aḍaykka as [ɐɖɐjkʲːɐ] or [ɐɖɐkʲːɐ]. Some of the northern dialects might pronounce them without palatalization.
* The letter ഫ represents both , a phoneme occurring in Sanskrit loanwords, and , which is mostly found in comparatively recent borrowings from European languages. Though nowadays most people (especially youngsters) pronounce as like in the word . In the Jesari dialect the native word-initial /p/ too spirantized to [f].
* are unreleased word finally. Words will never begin or end with a geminated consonant. never occur word initially. All consonants appear word medially.
* The plain stops, affricates, nasals, laterals, the fricatives and and approximants other than can be geminated and gemination can sometimes change the meaning of the word, e.g. &quot;kaḷam&quot; &#x27;cell&#x27;, &quot;kaḷḷam&quot; &#x27;lie&#x27;. only occur in geminated form intervocalically.
* The approximant has both rhotic and lateral qualities, and is indeterminate between an approximant and a fricative. The articulation of changes part-way through, perhaps explaining why it behaves as both a rhotic and a lateral, both an approximant and a fricative, but the nature of the change is not understood.
* are weakly palatalized and have an advanced tongue root while are clear or velarized and have a retracted tongue root, particularly noticeable in geminates.
* /ʋ/ may be realized as [ʋ], [v], [w] or [β̞].
* Around 75% of &quot;nk&quot; and 50% of &quot;ñc&quot; and &quot;nt&quot; from Old Malayalam got assimilated to &quot;ṅṅ, ññ&quot; and &quot;nn&quot;, almost all of the &quot;ṉṯ&quot; merged with &quot;nn&quot; suggesting an earlier merger of some of the &quot;n̠t̠&quot; and &quot;nt&quot; (for e.g. the cognate of Tamil &quot;nan̠r̠i&quot; is spelt as &quot;nandi&quot; and pronounced nanni); &quot;mp&quot; and &quot;ṇṭ&quot; were unchanged, e.g. Tamil &quot;mūṉṟu, maruntu, kañci, teṅku,&quot; Malayalam &quot;mūnnŭ, marunnŭ, kaññi, teṅṅŭ.&quot; Word final &quot;ai, āy and ey&quot; became &quot;a&quot; unless the word is monosyllabic, e.g. Tamil &quot;avai, māṅgāy, veṇṇey&quot; Malayalam &quot;ava, māṅṅa, veṇṇa.&quot; Final &quot;āy&quot; in monosyllabic words became &quot;āya&quot; e.g. Tamil &quot;kāy&quot;, Malayalam &quot;kāya&quot;.
* Loanwords with /z/ are replaced with /s/ and not with /d͡ʒ/ like in Hindi or Telugu e.g. /brasi:l/ English &quot;Brazil&quot; unless it was loaned through Hindi then the Hindi pronunciation is taken e.g. /d͡ʒilla/ Hi. Per. , other Perso-Arabic phonemes like are replaced with /k, kʰ, g, h, C, ∅, ∅/, sometimes /q, x/ are replaced with /kʰ, k/ e.g. Arabic قطر &quot;qaṭar&quot;, خَطّ‎ &quot;xaṭṭ&quot; as ഖത്തർ &quot;khattaṟ&quot;, കത്ത് &quot;kattŭ&quot;. English loans with /θ, ð, ʒ/ are replaced with ; the dentals do not clash with English loans with /t, d/, which are replaced with [t, d] or [ʈ, ɖ] though [d] is rare because of the limited distribution natively e.g. &quot;taxi&quot; as &quot;ṯāksi&quot; or more commonly &quot;ṭāksi&quot;. The English /ɹ/ is loaned as either /ɾ/ or /r/ unpredictably, for e.g. &#x27;current&#x27; got loaned as &quot;karaṇḍŭ&quot; but &#x27;maroon&#x27; got loaned as &quot;mar̠ūṇ&quot; or &quot;mer̠ūṇ&quot; but the cluster /ɹs/ is loaned as /ɻs/ other clusters are loaned as /rC/ or /ɾC/, /ɻ/ only occurs in words with /ɹs/ e.g. &#x27;force&#x27; as &quot;fōḻsŭ&quot;. Speakers with non rhotic English accents don&#x27;t have /ɹC/ clusters in English loans and pronounce it as &quot;fōs(ŭ)&quot;. In Sanskrit loans with /t̪C/ and /d̪C/ (unless C is a sonorant or a dental stop) sometimes the /t̪, d̪/ becomes /l/ especially in /t̪s/ e.g. &quot;utsava &gt; ulsavam, utpādana &gt; ulpādaṉam, udghāṭana &gt; ulghāḍaṉam&quot;. There are some native words with /s/ (&quot;urasŭ&quot;) and /ʃ/ (&quot;vīśŭ&quot;) but rest of the fricatives (except /f/ in native words of Jesari) and aspirates are only found in loans.
* Rarely some speakers pronounce the voiced aspirated consonants as voiceless so words like &quot;dhaṉam&quot; as &quot;thaṉam&quot;, it is more commonly deaspirated so &quot;dhaṉam&quot; as &quot;daṉam&quot; and &quot;kharam&quot; as &quot;karam&quot;, intervocalically the voiceless aspirate also becomes voiced so &quot;mukham&quot; as &quot;mugam&quot;.

===Colloquial language===
* i, u gets lowered to e, o when before Ca, eg. &quot;iṭam, mukham &gt; eṭam, mogam&quot;, this change is seen in 10th century inscriptions, irunnaṭattu instead of irunniṭattu. Exceptions include &quot;ivan uḷḷa &gt; ivan, oḷḷa&quot; (south), &quot;ŭḷḷa iḷḷa, eḷḷa, ḷḷa&quot; in other dialects. Latter word and uṇṭŭ has seen such variation since old Malayalam of the south. u can become ŭ sporadically in other dialects as with the previous word.

* Medial u&#x27;s maybe pronounced as a kuttiyalugaram in the north and center, in central it may even merge with a for some, eg. kaṟuppŭ &gt; kaṟappŭ, appuṟam &gt; app(a)ṟam, taṇuttŭ &gt; taṇattŭ. In center and north, ru can become ri when there is a non back vowel preceding it, eg. ceruppŭ, irumpŭ, parutti &gt; cerippŭ, irimpŭ, paritti. This change is also seen in the standard form.

* Sporadic cases of a &gt; e, eg. laḍḍu, gaṅga, karayuka, raktam, raṇṭŭ &gt; leḍḍu, geṅṅa, kareyuka, rektam, reṇṭŭ.

* Cases of aya, ava &gt; ē, ō, most commonly in the north and in some castelects, ef. avaḷuṭe &gt; ōḷṭe.

* A general feature is that the overall length of vowels decrease further north you go.

* In fast speech initial consonants may be dropped, eg. ceytu koḷḷām &gt; ceytōḷām, ḍraiv cey &gt; ḍraivey, iṭṭu vaccu &gt; iṭṭēccu, pōkuka vēṇam &gt; pōkēṇam/pōkaṇam, paḻam āyi &gt; paḻōy, pōyi koḷḷuka vēṇam &gt; poykkōḷaṇam &gt; pokkyōṇam.

* l, ḷ, ḻ dropped in coda, eg. tāḻttŭ, vilkkŭ, ñaṅṅaḷuṭe (&gt;ñaṅṅaḷṭe), ippōḷ &gt; tāttŭ, vikkŭ, ñaṅṅaṭe, ippō. Northern and Southern dialects might hypercorrect the last and similar words to ippam. Word finally it happens only if the next word starts with a consonant.

* Medial k maybe lenited to a fricative or completely lost in center and north, eg. varukayilla &gt; SK. varilla, NK. CK. varūla; pōkunnŭ &gt; CK. pōṇŭ.

* ḻ merged with y in certain Mappila and castelects.
* More cases of nasal assimilation, eg. candaṉam, bhaṅgi &gt; cannaṉam, baṅṅi. In some dialects neñcŭ, kuṭumbam &gt; neññŭ, kuṭummam.
* Loss of aspiration.
* śc &gt; śś, some cc too, eg. niścayam, talaccēri &gt; niśśayam, talaśśēri.
* Merger of v with b farther north and sporadically in center, particularly among Mappila speech, e.g. vā, vēṇam &gt; bā, bēṇam. In some areas like Malappuram it&#x27;s merged with m instead, vēṇam &gt; mēṇam.

== Grammar ==
Malayalam has a canonical word order of SOV (subject–object–verb), as do other Dravidian languages. A rare OSV word order occurs in interrogative clauses when the interrogative word is the subject. Both adjectives and possessive adjectives precede the nouns they modify. Malayalam has 6 or 7 grammatical cases. Verbs are conjugated for tense, mood and aspect, but not for person, gender nor number except in archaic or poetic language. The modern Malayalam grammar is based on the book &quot;Kerala Panineeyam&quot; written by A. R. Raja Raja Varma in late 19th century CE.

=== Nouns ===
The declensional paradigms for some common nouns and pronouns are given below. As Malayalam is an agglutinative language, it is difficult to delineate the cases strictly and determine how many there are, although seven or eight is the generally accepted number. Alveolar plosives and nasals (although the modern Malayalam script does not distinguish the latter from the dental nasal) are underlined for clarity, following the convention of the National Library at Kolkata romanization.

=== Personal pronouns ===
Vocative forms are given in parentheses after the nominative, as the only pronominal vocatives that are used are the third person ones, which only occur in compounds.

=== Other nouns ===
The following are examples of some of the most common declension patterns.

=== Words adopted from Sanskrit ===
When words are adopted from Sanskrit, their endings are usually changed to conform to Malayalam norms:

==== Nouns ====
* Masculine Sanskrit nouns with a word stem ending in a short /a/ take the ending /an/ in the nominative singular. For example, Kr̥ṣṇa → Kr̥ṣṇan. The final /n/ is dropped before masculine surnames, honorifics, or titles ending in /an/ and beginning with a consonant other than /n/ – e.g., &quot;Krishna Menon&quot;, &quot;Krishna Kaniyaan&quot; etc., but &quot;Krishnan Ezhutthachan&quot;. Surnames ending with /ar/ or /aḷ/ (where these are plural forms of &quot;an&quot; denoting respect) are treated similarly – &quot;Krishna Pothuval&quot;, &quot;Krishna Chakyar&quot;, but &quot;Krishnan Nair&quot;, &quot;Krishnan Nambiar&quot;, as are Sanskrit surnames such &quot;Varma(n)&quot;, &quot;Sharma(n)&quot;, or &quot;Gupta(n)&quot; (rare) – e.g., &quot;Krishna Varma&quot;, &quot;Krishna Sharman&quot;. If a name is a compound, only the last element undergoes this transformation – e.g., &quot;Kr̥ṣṇa&quot; + &quot;dēva&quot; = &quot;Kr̥ṣṇadēvan&quot;, not &quot;Kr̥ṣṇandēvan&quot;.
* Feminine words ending in a long /ā/ or /ī/ are changed to end in a short /a/ or /i/, for example &quot;Sītā&quot; → &quot;Sīta&quot; and &quot;Lakṣmī&quot; → &quot;Lakṣmi&quot;. However, the long vowel still appears in compound words, such as &quot;Sītādēvi&quot; or&quot; Lakṣmīdēvi&quot;. The long ī is generally reserved for the vocative forms of these names, although in Sanskrit the vocative actually takes a short /i/. There are also a small number of nominative /ī/ endings that have not been shortened – a prominent example being the word &quot;strī&quot; for &quot;woman&quot;.
* Nouns that have a stem in /-an/ and which end with a long /ā/ in the masculine nominative singular have /vŭ/ added to them, for example &quot;Brahmā&quot; (stem &quot;Brahman&quot;) → &quot;Brahmāvŭ&quot;. When the same nouns are declined in the neuter and take a short /a/ ending in Sanskrit, Malayalam adds an additional /m/, e.g. &quot;Brahma&quot; (neuter nominative singular of &quot;Brahman&quot;) becomes &quot;Brahmam&quot;. This is again omitted when forming compounds.
* Words whose roots end in /-an/ but whose nominative singular ending is /-a-/ (for example, the Sanskrit root of &quot;karma&quot; is actually &quot;karman&quot;) are also changed. The original root is ignored and &quot;karma&quot; (the form in Malayalam being &quot;karmam&quot; because it ends in a short /a/) is taken as the basic form of the noun when declining. However, this does not apply to all consonant stems, as &quot;unchangeable&quot; stems such as &quot;manas&quot; (&quot;mind&quot;) and &quot;suhr̥t&quot; (&quot;friend&quot;) are identical to the Malayalam nominative singular forms (although the regularly derived &quot;manam&quot; sometimes occurs as an alternative to &quot;manas&quot;).
* Sanskrit words describing things or animals rather than people with a stem in short /a/ end with an /m/ in Malayalam. For example, &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot; → &quot;Rāmāyaṇam&quot;. In most cases, this is actually the same as the Sanskrit accusative case ending, which is also /m/ (or, allophonically, anusvara due to the requirements of the sandhi word-combining rules) in the neuter nominative. However, &quot;things and animals&quot; and &quot;people&quot; are not always differentiated based on whether or not they are sentient beings; for example, &quot;Narasimha&quot; becomes &quot;Narasiṃham&quot; and not &quot;Narasiṃhan&quot;, whereas &quot;Ananta&quot; becomes &quot;Anantan&quot; even though both are sentient. This does not strictly correspond to the Sanskrit neuter gender, as both &quot;Narasiṃha&quot; and &quot;Ananta&quot; are masculine nouns in the original Sanskrit.
* Nouns with short vowel stems other than /a/, such as &quot;Viṣṇu&quot;, &quot;Prajāpati&quot; etc. are declined with the Sanskrit stem acting as the Malayalam nominative singular (the Sanskrit nominative singular is formed by adding a visarga, e.g., as in &quot;Viṣṇuḥ&quot;)
* The original Sanskrit vocative is often used in formal or poetic Malayalam, e.g. &quot;Harē&quot; (for &quot;Hari&quot;) or &quot;Prabhō&quot; (for &quot;Prabhu&quot; – &quot;Lord&quot;). This is restricted to certain contexts – mainly when addressing deities or other exalted individuals, so a normal man named Hari would usually be addressed using a Malayalam vocative such as &quot;Harī&quot;. The Sanskrit genitive is also occasionally found in Malayalam poetry, especially the personal pronouns &quot;mama&quot; (&quot;my&quot; or &quot;mine&quot;) and &quot;tava&quot; (&quot;thy&quot; or &quot;thine&quot;). Other cases are less common and generally restricted to the realm of Maṇipravāḷam.
* Along with these tatsama borrowings, there are also many tadbhava words in common use. These were incorporated via borrowing before the separation of Malayalam and Tamil. As the language did not then accommodate Sanskrit phonology as it now does, words were changed to conform to the Old Tamil phonological system, for example &quot;Kr̥ṣṇa&quot; → &quot;Kaṇṇan&quot;. Most of his works are oriented on the basic Malayalam family and cultures and many of them were path-breaking in the history of Malayalam literature

== Writing system ==
Aside from the Malayalam script, the Malayalam language has been written in other scripts like Latin, Syriac and Arabic. Suriyani Malayalam was used by Saint Thomas Christians (also known as Nasranis) until the 19th century. Arabic scripts particularly were taught in madrasahs in Kerala and the Lakshadweep Islands.

=== Malayalam script ===
Historically, several scripts were used to write Malayalam. Among these were the Vatteluttu, Kolezhuthu and Malayanma scripts. But it was the Grantha script, another Southern Brahmi variation, which gave rise to the modern Malayalam script. The modern Malayalam script bears high similarity to Tigalari script, which was used for writing Tulu language in Coastal Karnataka (Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts) and the northernmost Kasaragod district of Kerala. It is syllabic in the sense that the sequence of graphic elements means that syllables have to be read as units, though in this system the elements representing individual vowels and consonants are for the most part readily identifiable. In the 1960s Malayalam dispensed with many special letters representing less frequent conjunct consonants and combinations of the vowel /u, u:/ with different consonants.

Malayalam script consists of a total of 578 characters. The script contains 52 letters including 16 vowels and 36 consonants, which forms 576 syllabic characters, and contains two additional diacritic characters named anusvāra and visarga. The earlier style of writing has been superseded by a new style as of 1981. This new script reduces the different letters for typesetting from 900 to fewer than 90. This was mainly done to include Malayalam in the keyboards of typewriters and computers.

In 1999 a group named &quot;Rachana Akshara Vedi&quot; produced a set of free fonts containing the entire character repertoire of more than 900 glyphs. This was announced and released along with a text editor in the same year at Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala. In 2004, the fonts were released under the GPL license by Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation at the Cochin University of Science and Technology in Kochi, Kerala.

=== Chillu letters ===
A &quot;chillu&quot; (, ), or a &quot;chillaksharam&quot; (, ), is a special consonant letter that represents a pure consonant independently, without help of a virama. Unlike a consonant represented by an ordinary consonant letter, this consonant is never followed by an inherent vowel. Anusvara and visarga fit this definition but are not usually included. ISCII and Unicode 5.0 treat a &quot;chillu&quot; as a glyph variant of a normal (&quot;base&quot;) consonant letter. In Unicode 5.1 and later, &quot;chillu&quot; letters are treated as independent characters, encoded atomically.

=== Number system and other symbols ===
=== Numerals ===

Malayalam numbers and fractions are written as follows. These are archaic and no longer used. Instead, the common Hindu-Arabic numeral system is followed. There is a confusion about the glyph of Malayalam digit zero. The correct form is oval-shaped, but occasionally the glyph for () is erroneously shown as the glyph for 0.
Number &quot;11&quot; is written as &quot;൰൧&quot; and not &quot;൧൧&quot;. &quot;32&quot; is written as &quot;൩൰൨&quot; similar to the Tamil numeral system.
For example, the number &quot;2013&quot; is read in Malayalam as (). It is split into:

* () : 2 – 
* () : 1000 – 
* () : 10 – 
* () : 3 – 

Combine them together to get the Malayalam number .

And 1,00,000 as &quot; = hundred(), thousand() (100×1000), 10,00,000 as &quot; = ten(), hundred(), thousand() (10×100×1000) and 1,00,00,000 as &quot;&quot; = hundred(), hundred(), thousand() (100×100×1000).

Later on this system got reformed to be more similar to the Hindu-Arabic numerals so 10,00,000 in the reformed numerals it would be .

=== Fractions ===
In Malayalam you can transcribe any fraction by affixing () after the denominator followed by the numerator, so a fraction like would be read as () &#x27;out of ten, seven&#x27; but fractions like and have distinct names (, , ) and () &#x27;half quarter&#x27;.

=== Vattezhuthu alphabet ===
Vatteluttu (, &quot;round writing&quot;) is a script that had evolved from Tamil-Brahmi and was once used extensively in the southern part of present-day Tamil Nadu and in Kerala.

Malayalam was first written in Vattezhuthu. The Vazhappally inscription issued by Rajashekhara Varman is the earliest example, dating from about 830 CE. During the medieval period, the Tigalari script that was used for writing Tulu in South Canara, and Sanskrit in the adjacent Malabar region, had a close similarity to the modern Malayalam script. In the Tamil country, the modern Tamil script had supplanted Vattezhuthu by the 15th century, but in the Malabar region, Vattezhuthu remained in general use up to the 17th century, or the 18th century. A variant form of this script, Kolezhuthu, was used until about the 19th century mainly in the Malabar-Cochin area.

Vatteluttu was in general use, but was not suitable for literature where many Sanskrit words were used. Like Tamil-Brahmi, it was originally used to write Tamil, and as such, did not have letters for voiced or aspirated consonants used in Sanskrit but not used in Tamil. For this reason, Vatteluttu and the Grantha alphabet were sometimes mixed, as in the Manipravalam. One of the oldest examples of the Manipravalam literature, &quot;Vaishikatantram&quot; (, &quot;Vaiśikatantram&quot;), dates back to the 12th century, where the earliest form of the Malayalam script was used, which seems to have been systematized to some extent by the first half of the 13th century.

Another variant form, Malayanma, was used in the south of Thiruvananthapuram. By the 19th century, old scripts like Kolezhuthu had been supplanted by Arya-eluttu – that is the current Malayalam script. Nowadays, it is widely used in the press of the Malayali population in Kerala.

=== Grantha ===
According to Arthur Coke Burnell, one form of the Grantha alphabet, originally used in the Chola dynasty, was imported into the southwest coast of India in the 8th or 9th century, which was then modified in course of time in this secluded area, where communication with the east coast was very limited. It later evolved into Tigalari-Malayalam script was used by the Malayali, Havyaka Brahmins and Tulu Brahmin people, but was originally only applied to write Sanskrit. This script split into two scripts: Tigalari and Malayalam. While Malayalam script was extended and modified to write vernacular language Malayalam, the Tigalari was written for Sanskrit only. In Malabar, this writing system was termed Arya-eluttu (, &quot;Ārya eḻuttŭ&quot;), meaning &quot;Arya writing&quot; (Sanskrit is Indo-Aryan language while Malayalam is a Dravidian language).

=== Karshoni ===

Suriyani Malayalam (സുറിയാനി മലയാളം, ܣܘܪܝܢܝ ܡܠܝܠܡ), also known as &quot;Karshoni&quot;, &quot;Syro-Malabarica&quot; or &quot;Syriac Malayalam&quot;, is a version of Malayalam written in a variant form of the Syriac alphabet which was popular among the Saint Thomas Christians (also known as Syrian Christians or Nasranis) of Kerala in India. It uses Malayalam grammar, the Maḏnḥāyā or &quot;Eastern&quot; Syriac script with special orthographic features, and vocabulary from Malayalam and East Syriac. This originated in the South Indian region of the Malabar Coast (modern-day Kerala). Until the 20th century, the script was widely used by Syrian Christians in Kerala.

=== Ponnani script ===

The Arabi Malayalam script, otherwise known as the Ponnani script, is a writing system – a variant form of the Arabic script with special orthographic features – which was developed during the early medieval period and used to write Arabi Malayalam until the early 20th century CE. Though the script originated and developed in Kerala, today it is predominantly used in Malaysia and Singapore by the migrant Muslim community.

== Literature ==
The Sangam literature can be considered as the ancient predecessor of Malayalam. According to Iravatham Mahadevan, the earliest Malayalam inscription discovered until now is the Edakal-5 inscription (ca. late 4th century – early 5th century) reading ( &#x27;this is old&#x27;). Although this has been disputed by many scholars who regard it as a regional dialect of Old Tamil. The use of the pronoun and the lack of the literary Tamil ending are archaisms from Proto-Dravidian rather than unique innovations of Malayalam.

The early literature of Malayalam comprised three types of composition:
Malayalam Nada, Tamil Nada and Sanskrit Nada.
* Classical songs known as Nadan Pattu
* Manipravalam of the Sanskrit tradition, which permitted a generous interspersing of Sanskrit with Malayalam. Niranam poets Manipravalam Madhava Panikkar, Sankara Panikkar and Rama Panikkar wrote Manipravalam poetry in the 14th century.
* The folk song rich in native elements
Malayalam literature has been profoundly influenced by poets Cherusseri Namboothiri, Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan, and Poonthanam Nambudiri, in the 15th and the 16th centuries of Common Era. Unnayi Variyar, a probable 17th–18th century poet, and Kunchan Nambiar, a poet of 18th century, also greatly influenced Malayalam literature in its early form. The words used in many of the Arabi Malayalam works those date back to 16th–17th centuries of Common Era are also very closer to the modern Malayalam language. The prose literature, criticism, and Malayalam journalism began after the latter half of 18th century CE. Contemporary Malayalam literature deals with social, political, and economic life context. The tendency of the modern poetry is often towards political radicalism. Malayalam literature has been presented with six Jnanapith awards, the second-most for any Dravidian language and the third-highest for any Indian language.

Malayalam poetry to the late 20th century betrays varying degrees of the fusion of the three different strands. The oldest examples of Pattu and Manipravalam, respectively, are &quot;Ramacharitam&quot; and &quot;Vaishikatantram&quot;, both from the 12th century.

The earliest extant prose work in the language is a commentary in simple Malayalam, &quot;Bhashakautalyam&quot; (12th century) on Chanakya&#x27;s &quot;Arthashastra&quot;. Adhyatmaramayanam by Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan (known as the father of modern Malayalam literature) who was born in Tirur, one of the most important works in Malayalam literature. Unnunili Sandesam written in the 14th century is amongst the oldest literary works in Malayalam language. Cherusseri Namboothiri of 15th century (Kannur-based poet), Poonthanam Nambudiri of 16th century (Perinthalmanna-based poet), Unnayi Variyar of 17th–18th centuries (Thrissur-based poet), and Kunchan Nambiar of 18th century (Palakkad-based poet), have played a major role in the development of Malayalam literature into current form. The words used in many of the Arabi Malayalam works, which dates back to 16th–17th centuries are also very closer to modern Malayalam language. The basin of the river Bharathappuzha, which is otherwise known as River Ponnani, and its tributaries, have played a major role in the development of modern Malayalam Literature.

By the end of the 18th century some of the Christian missionaries from Kerala started writing in Malayalam but mostly travelogues, dictionaries and religious books. Varthamanappusthakam (1778), written by Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar is considered to be the first travelogue in an Indian language. The modern Malayalam grammar is based on the book &quot;Kerala Panineeyam&quot; written by A. R. Raja Raja Varma in late 19th century CE.

=== Folk Songs ===
For the first 600 years of the Malayalam calendar, Malayalam literature remained in a preliminary stage. During this time, Malayalam literature consisted mainly of various genres of songs (&quot;Pattu&quot;). Folk songs are the oldest literary form in Malayalam. They were just oral songs. Many of them were related to agricultural activities, including &quot;Pulayar Pattu&quot;, &quot;Pulluvan Pattu&quot;, &quot;Njattu Pattu&quot;, &quot;Koythu Pattu&quot;, etc. Other Ballads of Folk Song period include the &quot;Vadakkan Pattukal&quot; (Northern songs) in North Malabar region and the &quot;Thekkan Pattukal&quot; (Southern songs) in Southern Travancore. Some of the earliest Mappila songs (Muslim songs) were also folk songs.

=== Old and Middle Malayalam ===
The earliest known poems in Malayalam, &quot;Ramacharitam&quot; and &quot;Thirunizhalmala&quot;, dated to the 12th to 14th century, were completed before the introduction of the Sanskrit alphabet. It was written by a poet with the pen name &quot;Cheeramakavi&quot; who, according to poet Ulloor S Parameswara Iyer, was Sree Veerarama Varman, a king of southern Kerala from AD 1195 to 1208. However the claim that it was written in Southern Kerala is expired on the basis of new discoveries. Other experts, like Chirakkal T Balakrishnan Nair, K.M. George, M. M. Purushothaman Nair, and P.V. Krishnan Nair, state that the origin of the book is in Kasaragod district in North Malabar region. They cite the use of certain words in the book and also the fact that the manuscript of the book was recovered from Nileshwaram in North Malabar. The influence of &quot;Ramacharitam&quot; is mostly seen in the contemporary literary works of Northern Kerala. The words used in &quot;Ramacharitam&quot; such as &quot;Nade&quot; (&quot;Mumbe&quot;), &quot;Innum&quot; (&quot;Iniyum&quot;), &quot;Ninna&quot; (&quot;Ninne&quot;), Chaaduka (&quot;Eriyuka&quot;) are special features of the dialect spoken in North Malabar (Kasaragod-Kannur region). Furthermore, the Thiruvananthapuram mentioned in &quot;Ramacharitham&quot; is not the Thiruvananthapuram in Southern Kerala. But it is Ananthapura Lake Temple of Kumbla in the northernmost Kasaragod district of Kerala. The word &quot;Thiru&quot; is used just by the meaning &quot;Honoured&quot;. Today it is widely accepted that &quot;Ramacharitham&quot; was written somewhere in North Malabar (most likely near Kasaragod).

But the period of the earliest available literary document cannot be the sole criterion used to determine the antiquity of a language. In its early literature, Malayalam has songs, &quot;Pattu&quot;, for various subjects and occasions, such as harvesting, love songs, heroes, gods, etc. A form of writing called &quot;Campu&quot; emerged from the 14th century onwards. It mixed poetry with prose and used a vocabulary strongly influenced by Sanskrit, with themes from epics and &quot;Puranas&quot;.

The works including &quot;Unniyachi Charitham&quot;, &quot;Unnichirudevi Charitham&quot;, and &quot;Unniyadi Charitham&quot;, are written in Middle Malayalam, those date back to 13th and 14th centuries of Common Era. The &quot;Sandesha Kavya&quot;s of 14th century CE written in Manipravalam language include &quot;Unnuneeli Sandesam&quot; The literary works written in Middle Malayalam were heavily influenced by Sanskrit and Prakrit, while comparing them with the modern Malayalam literature. The word &quot;Manipravalam&quot; literally means &quot;Diamond-Coral&quot; or &quot;Ruby-Coral&quot;. The 14th-century &quot;Lilatilakam&quot; text states Manipravalam to be a &quot;Bhashya&quot; (language) where &quot;Malayalam and Sanskrit should combine together like ruby and coral, without the least trace of any discord&quot;. The &quot;Champu Kavyas&quot; written by Punam Nambudiri, one among the &quot;Pathinettara Kavikal&quot; (Eighteen and a half poets) in the court of the Zamorin of Calicut, also belong to Middle Malayalam.

=== Modern Malayalam ===
The poem &quot;Krishnagatha&quot; written by Cherusseri Namboothiri, who was the court poet of the king Udaya Varman Kolathiri (1446–1475) of Kolathunadu, is written in modern Malayalam. The language used in &quot;Krishnagatha&quot; is the modern spoken form of Malayalam. It appears to be the first literary work written in the present-day language of Malayalam. During the 16th century CE, Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan from the Kingdom of Tanur and Poonthanam Nambudiri from the Kingdom of Valluvanad followed the new trend initiated by Cherussery in their poems. The &quot;Adhyathmaramayanam Kilippattu&quot; and &quot;Mahabharatham Kilippattu&quot; written by Ezhuthachan and &quot;Jnanappana&quot; written by Poonthanam are also included in the earliest form of Modern Malayalam. The words used in most of the Arabi Malayalam works, which dates back to 16th–17th centuries, are also very closer to modern Malayalam language. P. Shangunny Menon ascribes the authorship of the medieval work &quot;Keralolpathi&quot;, which describes the Parashurama legend and the departure of the final Cheraman Perumal king to Mecca, to Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan.
Kunchan Nambiar, the founder of &quot;Thullal&quot; movement, was a prolific literary figure of the 18th century.

==== Impact of European scholars ====

The British printed Malabar English Dictionary by Graham Shaw in 1779 was still in the form of a Tamil-English Dictionary. Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar wrote the first Malayalam travelogue called &quot;Varthamanappusthakam&quot; in 1789.

Hermann Gundert, (1814–1893), a German missionary and scholar of exceptional linguistic talents, played a distinguishable role in the development of Malayalam literature. His major works are Keralolpathi (1843), Pazhancholmala (1845), Malayalabhaasha Vyakaranam (1851), &quot;Paathamala (1860) the first Malayalam school text book&quot;, Kerala pazhama (1868), &quot;the first Malayalam dictionary (1872)&quot;, Malayalarajyam (1879) – Geography of Kerala, &quot;Rajya Samacharam (1847 June) the first Malayalam news paper&quot;, Paschimodayam (1879) – Magazine. He lived in Thalassery for around 20 years. He learned the language from well established local teachers Ooracheri Gurukkanmar from Chokli, a village near Thalassery and consulted them in works. He also translated the Bible into Malayalam.

In 1821, the Church Mission Society (CMS) at Kottayam in association with the Syriac Orthodox Church started a seminary at Kottayam in 1819 and started printing books in Malayalam when Benjamin Bailey, an Anglican priest, made the first Malayalam types. In addition, he contributed to standardizing the prose. Hermann Gundert from Stuttgart, Germany, started the first Malayalam newspaper, &quot;Rajya Samacaram&quot; in 1847 at Talasseri. It was printed at Basel Mission. Malayalam and Sanskrit were increasingly studied by Christians of Kottayam and Pathanamthitta. The Marthomite movement in the mid-19th century called for replacement of Syriac by Malayalam for liturgical purposes. By the end of the 19th century Malayalam replaced Syriac as language of Liturgy in all Syrian Christian churches.

==== 1850–1904 ====
Vengayil Kunhiraman Nayanar, (1861–1914) from Thalassery was the author of first Malayalam short story, Vasanavikriti. After him innumerable world class literature works by was born in Malayalam.

O. Chandu Menon wrote his novels &quot;Indulekha&quot; and &quot;Saradha&quot; while he was the judge at Parappanangadi Munciff Court. &quot;Indulekha&quot; is also the first Major Novel written in Malayalam language.

The third quarter of the 19th century CE bore witness to the rise of a new school of poets devoted to the observation of life around them and the use of pure Malayalam. The major poets of the Venmani School were Venmani Achhan Nambudiripad (1817–1891), Venmani Mahan Nambudiripad (1844–1893), Poonthottam Achhan Nambudiri (1821–1865), Poonthottam Mahan Nambudiri (1857–1896) and the members of the Kodungallur Kovilakam (Royal Family) such as Kodungallur Kunjikkuttan Thampuran. The style of these poets became quite popular for a while and influenced even others who were not members of the group like Velutheri Kesavan Vaidyar (1839–1897) and Perunlli Krishnan Vaidyan (1863–1894). The Venmani school pioneered a style of poetry that was associated with common day themes, and the use of pure Malayalam (&quot;Pachcha Malayalam&quot;) rather than Sanskrit.

=== Twentieth century ===
In the second half of the 20th century, Jnanpith winning poets and writers like G. Sankara Kurup, S. K. Pottekkatt, Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai, M. T. Vasudevan Nair, O. N. V. Kurup, Edasseri Govindan Nair and Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri, had made valuable contributions to the modern Malayalam literature. Later, writers like O. V. Vijayan, Kamaladas, M. Mukundan, Arundhati Roy, and Vaikom Muhammed Basheer, have gained international recognition.

==== Prose ====
The travelogues written by S. K. Pottekkatt were turning point in the travelogue literature. The writers like Kavalam Narayana Panicker have contributed much to Malayalam drama.

Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai turned away from party politics and produced a moving romance in &quot;Chemmeen&quot; (Shrimps) in 1956. For S. K. Pottekkatt and Vaikom Muhammad Basheer, who had not dabbled in politics, the continuity is marked in the former&#x27;s &quot;Vishakanyaka&quot; (Poison Maid, 1948) and the latter&#x27;s &quot;Ntuppuppakkoranendarnnu&quot; (My Grandpa had an Elephant, 1951). The non-political social or domestic novel was championed by P. C. Kuttikrishnan (Uroob) with his &quot;Ummachu&quot; (1955) and &quot;Sundarikalum Sundaranmarum&quot; (Men and Women of Charm, 1958).

In 1957 Basheer&#x27;s &quot;Pathummayude Aadu&quot; (Pathumma&#x27;s Goat) brought in a new kind of prose tale, which perhaps only Basheer could handle with dexterity. The fifties thus mark the evolution of a new kind of fiction, which had its impact on the short stories as well. This was the auspicious moment for the entry of M. T. Vasudevan Nair and T. Padmanabhan upon the scene. Front runners in the post-modern trend include Kakkanadan, O. V. Vijayan, E. Harikumar, M. Mukundan and Anand.

Kerala has the highest media exposure in India with newspapers publishing in nine languages, mainly English and Malayalam.

==== Poetry ====
Contemporary Malayalam poetry deals with social, political, and economic life context. The tendency of the modern poetry is often towards political radicalism.

<text>Stevana &quot;Stevie&quot; Case (born 1976–1977) is an American businesswoman. She is known for competing in the first-person shooter game &quot;Quake&quot; in the late 1990s, as well as contributing professionally to the video game industry.

Competing under the alias KillCreek, she was one of the first notable female esports players, gaining recognition for beating &quot;Quake&quot; designer John Romero in a &quot;Quake&quot; deathmatch in 1997. She was the first professional gamer signed to the Cyberathlete Professional League (CPL).

Case worked for Ion Storm between 1997 and 2001, conducting quality assurance and level design. She left the company to manage Monkeystone Games with former Ion Storm employees Romero and Tom Hall. After a stint at Warner Bros. managing the production of mobile games, she began working at various companies in business development and sales.

==Early life==
Case was raised in Olathe, Kansas. Her parents are a science teacher and a social worker, and she has a younger brother named Andy. As a child, she enjoyed playing computer games. Her first gaming experiences were with &quot;Lode Runner&quot; and &quot;Joust&quot; on an Apple IIe computer her father bought when she was in second grade.

Case attended Olathe East High School from 1991 to 1994. As the student government president, she was one of the plaintiffs in the 1995 court case &quot;Case v. Unified School District No. 233&quot;. During the trial, students and parents in Olathe successfully challenged the school district&#x27;s decision to ban &quot;Annie on my Mind&quot; from the school library. Case later attended the University of Kansas in hopes of getting into law school.

==Career==

=== Professional &quot;Quake&quot; player and John Romero deathmatch ===
While at the University of Kansas as a freshman studying political science, Case enjoyed playing &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Doom II&quot; with her circle of friends. Through her then-boyfriend, Tom &quot;Entropy&quot; Kimzey, she became interested in playing &quot;Quake&quot; competitively. Case joined Kimzey&#x27;s team, Impulse 9, and began competing under the name KillCreek. This alias was taken from the Lawrence, Kansas band Kill Creek, who had a member Case was friends with. Impulse 9 competed in the &quot;Quake&quot; competitive league Clanring, and won the T1 championship event in 1996.

After a few months of competing and making a name for herself, Case traveled to Dallas on a pilgrimage to meet some of the developers of her favorite first-person-shooter computer games. During her trip, she got the chance to play a &quot;Quake&quot; deathmatch against the game&#x27;s designer, John Romero, but was beaten by him in a close game. After Romero put up a web page jokingly insulting her skill at the game, Case publicly demanded a rematch with him. While Case initially struggled in the best-of-three rematch, she rallied back to win the first round 25–19, and went on to ultimately defeat Romero. As punishment, Romero agreed to set up a web page praising Case.

Case was twenty years old at the time she won the rematch in 1997, and beating one of the co-creators of &quot;Quake&quot; at his own game brought her a lot of publicity. She gained a sponsor in computer mouse manufacturer SpaceTec IMC that year, and her victory against Romero received coverage in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Angel Munoz, the founder of the Cyberathlete Professional League (CPL), convinced Case to join his league in July 1997, becoming its first signed professional gamer. She eventually became one of the league&#x27;s original founders. Case competed in the first all-female &quot;Quake&quot; tournament that year, coming in second behind Kornelia Takacs. With the stability of sponsors and a $1000 monthly stipend from the CPL, Case decided to drop out of university and move to Dallas in the middle of 1997; she said that while she had a passion for political science, she &quot;was not excited about the day-to-day aspects of politics or practicing law.&quot;

=== Transition to game design ===
While playing professionally, Case began looking at game design as a potential career, stating, &quot;I love games, and I love competition—but having no choice but to play the same game day-in and day-out with all sorts of pressure attached just didn&#x27;t suit my nature.&quot; According to Case, she did freelance game design work from her Dallas home for two years after university, using free design tools that she downloaded. One of the first game levels she designed was for &quot;&quot; (1999). Setting up a small studio called Primitive Earthling Games, she and some friends created a &quot;Quake II&quot; add-on called &quot;Vengeance&quot; and submitted it to WizardWorks. However, it never became available for purchase due to publishing delays. Between 1998 and 2000, Case authored three strategy guide books for Prima Games: &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit 2&quot; (1998), &quot;Buck Bumble&quot; (1998), and &quot;Daikatana&quot; (2000). She also contributed to their &quot;Quake II&quot; strategy guide.

Case was hired at Ion Storm in the summer of 1997 as a video game tester. After numerous members of the &quot;Daikatana&quot; development team left during the game&#x27;s troubled production, Case accepted Romero&#x27;s job offer to become a level designer in November 1998. Case helped design levels for &quot;Daikatana&quot; and &quot;Anachronox&quot; (2001). It was during this time period that Case began to date Romero. According to David Kushner&#x27;s &quot;Masters of Doom&quot;, it was at this point when Case &quot;radically reinvented herself&quot; by losing weight, bleaching her hair, and undergoing breast augmentation surgery. Case received further press coverage, appearing on the March 2000 cover of &quot;PC Accelerator&quot;, and being featured as one of the &quot;Next Game Gods&quot; in the November 2000 issue of &quot;PC Gamer&quot;. She was approached by &quot;Playboy&quot; to appear in a nude pictorial, based on an interview she did in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. The pictorial was released online in May 2000. When asked about how she changed after moving to Dallas and making video games a career, Case responded:Making the leap to games helped me to realize that the only way to be truly happy is to live by your own rules, not limited by outside expectations. I love my job, found a wonderful boyfriend and truly found myself through games.Case was still involved in the Cyberathlete Professional League in some capacity. She eventually transitioned into being CPL&#x27;s &quot;Master of Ceremonies&quot;, and in 1999, Case joined the CPL&#x27;s board of directors.

Case left Ion Storm in January 2001 to follow Romero to his new company, Monkeystone Games, which was founded in August 2001. Monkeystone was a mobile game development company formed from Romero&#x27;s interest in mobile games, sparked by him wanting to move away from the lengthy development cycles of big-budget computer games. Case worked as a producer for Monkeystone&#x27;s first game, &quot;Hyperspace Delivery Boy!&quot;, and also created the music and sound effects. She also was credited on titles like Monkeystone&#x27;s &quot;Red Faction&quot; port for the N-Gage. After leaving Monkeystone Games, Case became a senior project manager for Warner Bros. Online&#x27;s mobile group.

=== Sales and business development ===
According to Case, she decided at this point to slowly transition out of working in the game development industry, stating in an interview: There was a ton of harassment and hate and sexism and abuse. People would send me hate email all the time. ... The benefit of connecting with people was so drowned out by how bad it felt to be in the spotlight. Case recalled receiving the opportunity to leave game development when one of her contacts approached her about a potential junior sales position at his workplace. After leaving Warner Bros., Case was employed at Tira Wireless in sales and business development. Afterwards, she held a position with Spleak Media Network, where she was a director of product management.

In September 2008, she was vice president of business development and sales for fatfoogoo, an online commerce company. Case also served as Senior Director of Business Development at Live Gamer, and joined PlaySpan in 2010 as vice president of sales. PlaySpan was acquired by Visa in 2011.

On March 1, 2010, NewWorld, the former parent company of the CPL, announced that it had signed a two-year agreement with Stevie Case for the production of a new podcast show called &quot;Stevie FTW&quot;. According to the website&#x27;s RSS feed, the last podcast was uploaded on March 11, 2011, and the last social media update was on the same date.

After working as the vice president of growth at San Francisco-based startup Layer, in 2022 Case became the Chief Revenue Officer at computer security firm Vanta. She is also listed as a participant in SheEO, a nonprofit supporting the funding of female entrepreneurs, as well as the female investor group 37 Angels.

==Personal life==
Case dated &quot;Quake&quot; player Tom &quot;Entropy&quot; Kimzey, who was also a University of Kansas student and a member of Impulse 9. According to the June 1997 issue of &quot;Spin&quot;, they were involved romantically until the spring of 1997. Case had also dated game developer Tom Mustaine.

Soon after defeating John Romero in a &quot;Quake&quot; deathmatch, she and Romero started dating. Case and Romero moved in together in 1999, but their relationship ended in May 2003.

Case went on to marry a director of product development at THQ, and had a child with him. In a 2016 interview, Case stated that she had been a single parent with full custody of her child for eight years.

<doc id="37304" wikidata="Q48301" url="?curid=37304" title="Martin Heidegger">
<text>Martin Heidegger (; ; 26 September 1889 – 26 May 1976) was a German philosopher best known for contributions to phenomenology, hermeneutics, and existentialism. His work covers a wide range of topics including ontology, technology, art, metaphysics, humanism, language and history of philosophy. He is often considered to be among the most important and influential philosophers of the 20th century, especially in the continental tradition.

In April 1933, Heidegger was elected as rector at the University of Freiburg and was widely criticized for his membership and support for the Nazi Party during his tenure. After World War II he was dismissed from Freiburg and banned from teaching after denazification hearings at Freiburg. There has been controversy about the relationship between his philosophy and Nazism.

In Heidegger&#x27;s first major text, &quot;Being and Time&quot; (1927), &quot;Dasein&quot; is introduced as a term for the type of being that humans possess. Heidegger believed that Dasein already has a &quot;pre-ontological&quot; and concrete understanding that shapes how it lives, which he analyzed in terms of the unitary structure of &quot;being-in-the-world&quot;. Heidegger used this analysis to approach the question of the meaning of being; that is, the question of how entities appear as the specific entities they are. In other words, Heidegger&#x27;s governing &quot;question of being&quot; is concerned with what makes beings intelligible as beings.

==Life==

===Early years===

Heidegger was born on 26 September 1889 in rural Meßkirch, Baden, the son of Johanna (Kempf) and Friedrich Heidegger. His father was the sexton of the village church, and the young Martin was raised Roman Catholic.

In 1903, Heidegger began to train for the priesthood. He entered a Jesuit seminary in 1909, but was discharged within weeks because of heart trouble. It was during this time that he first encountered the work of Franz Brentano. From here he went on to study theology and scholastic philosophy at the University of Freiburg.

In 1911, he broke off training for the priesthood and turned his attention to recent philosophy, in particular, Edmund Husserl&#x27;s &quot;Logical Investigations&quot;. He graduated with a thesis on psychologism, &quot;The Doctrine of Judgment in Psychologism: A Critical-theoretical Contribution to Logic&quot;, in 1914. The following year, he completed his habilitation thesis on Duns Scotus, which was directed by Heinrich Rickert, a Neo-Kantian, and influenced by Husserl&#x27;s phenomenology. The title has been published in several languages and in English is &quot;Duns Scotus&#x27;s doctrine of categories and meaning&quot;.

He attempted to get the (Catholic) philosophy post at the University of Freiburg on 23 June 1916 but failed despite the support of . Instead, he worked first as an unsalaried Privatdozent then served as a soldier during the final year of World War I. His service was in the last ten months of the war, most of which he spent in meteorological unit on the western front upon being deemed unfit for combat.

Heidegger married Elfride Petri on 21 March 1917 in a Catholic ceremony officiated by his friend , and a week later in a Protestant ceremony in the presence of her parents. Their first son, Jörg, was born in 1919. Elfride then gave birth to in August 1920. Heidegger knew that he was not Hermann&#x27;s biological father, but raised him as his son. Hermann&#x27;s biological father, who became godfather to his son, was family friend and doctor Friedel Caesar. Hermann was told of this at the age of 14; Hermann grew up to become a historian and would later serve as the executor of Heidegger&#x27;s will.

In the same year that he married his wife, Heidegger began a decades-long correspondence with her friend Elisabeth Blochmann. Their letters are suggestive from the beginning, and it is certain they were romantically involved in the summer of 1929. Blochmann was Jewish, which raises questions in light of Heidegger&#x27;s later membership in the Nazi Party.

From 1919 to 1923, Heidegger taught courses at the University of Freiburg. At this time he also became an assistant to Husserl, who had been a professor there since 1916.

===Marburg===
In 1923, Heidegger was elected to an extraordinary professorship in philosophy at the University of Marburg. His colleagues there included Rudolf Bultmann, Nicolai Hartmann, Paul Tillich, and Paul Natorp. Heidegger&#x27;s students at Marburg included Hans-Georg Gadamer, Hannah Arendt, Karl Löwith, Gerhard Krüger, Leo Strauss, Jacob Klein, Günther Anders, and Hans Jonas. Following Aristotle, he began to develop in his lectures the main theme of his philosophy: the question of the sense of being. He extended the concept of subject to the dimension of history and concrete existence, which he found prefigured in such Christian thinkers as Paul of Tarsus, Augustine of Hippo, Martin Luther, and Søren Kierkegaard. He also read the works of Wilhelm Dilthey, Husserl, Max Scheler, and Friedrich Nietzsche.

In 1925, a 35-year-old Heidegger began what would be a four-year affair with Hannah Arendt, who was then 19 years old and his student. Like Blochmann, Arendt was Jewish. Heidegger and Arendt agreed to keep the details of the relationship a secret, preserving their letters, but keeping them unavailable. The affair was not widely known until 1995, when Elzbieta Ettinger gained access to the sealed correspondence. Nevertheless, Arendt faced criticism for her association with Heidegger after his election as rector at the University of Freiburg in 1933.

In 1927, Heidegger published his main work, &quot;Sein und Zeit&quot; (&quot;Being and Time&quot;). He was primarily concerned to qualify to be a full professor. The book, however, did more than this: it raised him to &quot;a position of international intellectual visibility.&quot;

===Freiburg===
When Husserl retired as professor of philosophy in 1928, Heidegger accepted Freiburg&#x27;s election to be his successor, in spite of a counter-offer by Marburg. The title of his 1929 inaugural lecture was &quot;What is Metaphysics?&quot; In this year he also published &quot;Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics&quot;.

Heidegger remained at Freiburg im Breisgau for the rest of his life, declining later offers including one from Humboldt University of Berlin. His students at Freiburg included Hannah Arendt, Günther Anders, Hans Jonas, Karl Löwith, Charles Malik, Herbert Marcuse, and Ernst Nolte. Emmanuel Levinas attended his lecture courses during his stay in Freiburg in 1928, as did Jan Patočka in 1933; Patočka in particular was deeply influenced by him.

Heidegger was elected rector of the university on 21 April 1933; he joined the Nazi Party on 1 May, just three months after Adolf Hitler was appointed chancellor. During his time as rector he was a member and an enthusiastic supporter of the party. There is continuing controversy as to the relationship between his philosophy and his political allegiance to Nazism. He wanted to position himself as the philosopher of the party, but the highly abstract nature of his work and the opposition of Alfred Rosenberg, who himself aspired to act in that position, limited Heidegger&#x27;s role. His withdrawal from his position as rector owed more to his frustration as an administrator than to any principled opposition to the Nazis, according to historians. In his inaugural address as rector on 27 May he expressed his support of a German revolution, and in an article and a speech to the students from the same year he also supported Adolf Hitler. In November 1933, Heidegger signed the &quot;Vow of allegiance of the Professors of the German Universities and High-Schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic State&quot;. Heidegger resigned from the rectorate in April 1934, but remained a member of the Nazi Party until 1945 even though the Nazis eventually prevented him from publishing.

In 1935, he gave the talk &quot;The Origin of the Work of Art&quot;. The next year, while in Rome, Heidegger gave his first lecture on Friedrich Hölderlin. In the years 19361937, Heidegger wrote what some commentators consider his second greatest work, &quot;Contributions to Philosophy&quot;; it would not be published, however, until 1989, 13 years after his death.

From 1936 to 1940, Heidegger also delivered a series of lectures on Friedrich Nietzsche at Freiburg that presented much of the raw material incorporated in his more established work and thought from this time. These would appear in published form in 1961. This period also marks the beginning of his interest in the &quot;essence of technology&quot;.

In the autumn of 1944, Heidegger was drafted into the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; and assigned to dig anti-tank ditches along the Rhine.

===Post-war===
In late 1946, as France engaged in &quot;épuration légale&quot; in its occupation zone, the French military authorities determined that Heidegger should be blocked from teaching or participating in any university activities because of his association with the Nazi Party. Nevertheless, he presented the talk &quot;What are Poets for?&quot; in memory of Rilke. He also published &quot;On Humanism&quot; in 1947 to clarify his differences with Jean-Paul Sartre and French existentialism. The denazification procedures against Heidegger continued until March 1949 when he was finally pronounced a &quot;Mitläufer&quot; (the second lowest of five categories of &quot;incrimination&quot; by association with the Nazi regime). No punitive measures against him were proposed. This opened the way for his readmission to teaching at Freiburg University in the winter semester of 1950–51. He was granted emeritus status and then taught regularly from 1951 until 1958, and by invitation until 1967.

In 1966, he gave an interview to &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; attempting to justify his support of the Nazi Party. Per their agreement, it was not published until five days after his death in 1976, under the title &quot;Only a God Can Save Us&quot; after a reference to Hölderlin that Heidegger makes during the interview.

Heidegger&#x27;s publications during this time were mostly reworked versions of his lectures. In his last days, he also arranged for a complete edition of his works to be compiled and published. Its first volume appeared in 1975. As of 2019, the edition is almost complete at over 100 volumes.

=== Death ===
Heidegger died on 26 May 1976 in Freiburg. A few months before his death, he met with Bernhard Welte, a Catholic priest, Freiburg University professor and earlier correspondent. The exact nature of their conversation is not known, but what is known is that it included talk of Heidegger&#x27;s relationship to the Catholic Church and subsequent Christian burial at which the priest officiated. Heidegger was buried in the Meßkirch cemetery.

==Early influences==
Edmund Husserl, the founder of phenomenology, was Heidegger&#x27;s teacher and a major influence on his thought. While the specific lines of influence remain a matter of scholarly dispute, one thing is clear: Heidegger&#x27;s early work on &quot;Being and Time&quot; moved away from Husserl&#x27;s theory of intentionality to focus on the pre-theoretical conditions that enable consciousness to grasp objects.

Aristotle influenced Heidegger from an early age. This influence was mediated through Catholic theology, medieval philosophy, and Franz Brentano. 
According to scholar Michael Wheeler, it is by way of a &quot;radical rethinking&quot; of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Metaphysics&quot; that Heidegger supplants Husserl&#x27;s notion of intentionality with his unitary notion of being-in-the-world. According to this reinterpretation, the various modes of being are united in more basic capacity of taking-as or making-present-to.
The works of Wilhelm Dilthey shaped Heidegger&#x27;s very early project of developing a &quot;hermeneutics of factical life&quot;, and his hermeneutical transformation of phenomenology. There is little doubt that Heidegger seized upon Dilthey&#x27;s concept of hermeneutics. Heidegger&#x27;s novel ideas about ontology required a &quot;gestalt&quot; formation, not merely a series of logical arguments, in order to demonstrate his fundamentally new paradigm of thinking, and the hermeneutic circle offered a new and powerful tool for the articulation and realization of these ideas.

Søren Kierkegaard contributed much to Heidegger&#x27;s treatment of the existentialist aspects of his thought located in Division II of &quot;Being and Time&quot;. Heidegger&#x27;s concepts of anxiety (&quot;Angst&quot;) and mortality draw on Kierkegaard and are indebted to the way in which the latter lays out the importance of our subjective relation to truth, our existence in the face of death, the temporality of existence, and the importance of passionate affirmation of one&#x27;s individual being-in-the-world.

==Philosophy==

=== Fundamental ontology ===
According to scholar Taylor Carman, traditional ontology asks &quot;Why is there anything?&quot;, whereas Heidegger&#x27;s fundamental ontology asks &quot;What does it mean for something to be?&quot; Heidegger&#x27;s ontology &quot;is fundamental relative to traditional ontology in that it concerns what any understanding of entities necessarily presupposes, namely, our understanding of that by virtue of which entities are entities&quot;.

This line of inquiry is &quot;central to Heidegger&#x27;s philosophy&quot;. He accuses the Western philosophical tradition of mistakenly trying to understand &quot;being as such&quot; as if it were an ultimate entity. Heidegger modifies traditional ontology by focusing instead on the &quot;meaning of being&quot;. This kind of ontological inquiry, he claims, is required to understand the basis of our understanding, scientific and otherwise.

In short, before asking what exists, Heidegger contends that people must first examine what &quot;to exist&quot; even means.

===&quot;Being and Time&quot;===

In his first major work, &quot;Being and Time&quot;, Heidegger pursues this ontological inquiry by way of an analysis of the kind of being that people have, namely, that humans are the sort of beings able to pose the question of the meaning of being. According to Canadian philosopher Sean McGrath Heidegger was probably influenced by Scotus in this approach. His term for us, in this phenomenological context, is Dasein.

This procedure works because Dasein&#x27;s &quot;pre-ontological&quot; understanding of being shapes experience. Dasein&#x27;s ordinary and even mundane experience of &quot;being-in-the-world&quot; provides &quot;access to the meaning&quot; or &quot;sense of being&quot;; that is, the terms in which &quot;something becomes intelligible as something.&quot; Heidegger proposes that this ordinary &quot;prescientific&quot; understanding precedes abstract ways of knowing, such as logic or theory. &quot;Being and Time&quot; is designed to show how this implicit understanding can be made progressively explicit through phenomenology and hermeneutics.

====Being-in-the-world====
Heidegger introduces the term Dasein to denote a &quot;living being&quot; through its activity of &quot;being there&quot;. Understood as a unitary phenomenon rather than a contingent, additive combination, it is characterized by Heidegger as &quot;being-in-the-world&quot;.

Heidegger insists that the &#x27;in&#x27; of Dasein&#x27;s being-in-the-world is an &#x27;in&#x27; of involvement or of engagement, not of objective, physical enclosedness. The sense in which Dasein is &#x27;in&#x27; the world is the sense of &quot;residing&quot; or &quot;dwelling&quot; in the world. Heidegger provides a few examples: &quot;having to do with something, producing something, attending to something and looking after it, making use of something&quot;.

Just as &#x27;being-in&#x27; does not denote objective, physical enclosedness, so &#x27;world&#x27;, as Heidegger uses the term, does not denote a universe of physical objects. The world, in Heidegger&#x27;s sense, is to be understood according to our sense of our possibilities: things present themselves to people in terms of their projects, the uses to which they can put them. The &#x27;sight&#x27; with which people grasp equipment is not a mentalistic intentionality, but what Heidegger calls &#x27;circumspection&#x27;. This is to say that equipment reveals itself in terms of its &#x27;towards-which,&#x27; in terms of the work it is good for. In the everyday world, people are absorbed within the equipmental totality of their work-world. Moreover, on Heidegger&#x27;s analysis, this entails a radical holism. In his own words, &quot;there &#x27;is&#x27; no such thing as &quot;an&quot; equipment&quot;.

For example, when someone sits down to dinner and picks up their fork, they are not picking up an object with good stabbing properties: they are non-reflectively engaging an &#x27;in-order-to-eat&#x27;. When it works as expected, equipment is transparent; when it is used, it is subsumed under the work toward which it is employed. Heidegger calls this structure of practically ordered reference relations the &#x27;worldhood of the world&#x27;.

Heidegger calls the mode of being of such entities &quot;ready-to-hand&quot;, for they are understood only in being handled. If the fork is made of plastic, however, and it snaps in the course of using it, then it assumes the mode of being that Heidegger calls &quot;present-at-hand.&quot; For now the fork needs to be made the object of focal awareness, considering it in terms of its properties. Is it too broken to use? If so, could the diner possibly get by with another utensil or just with their fingers? This kind of equipmental breakdown is not the only way that objects become present-at-hand for us, but Heidegger considers it typical of the way that this shift occurs in the course of ordinary goings-on.

In this way, Heidegger creates a theoretical space for the categories of subject and object, while at the same time denying that they apply to our most basic way of moving about in the world, of which they are instead presented as derivative.

Heidegger presents three primary structural features of being-in-the-world: understanding, attunement, and discourse. He calls these features &quot;existentiales&quot; or &quot;existentialia&quot; (&quot;Existenzialien&quot;) to distinguish their ontological status, as distinct from the &quot;categories&quot; of metaphysics.

* &quot;Understanding&quot; is &quot;our fundamental ability to be someone, to do things, to get around in the world&quot;. It is the basic &quot;know-how&quot; in terms of which Dasein goes about pursuing the usually humdrum tasks that make up daily life. Heidegger argues that this mode of understanding is more fundamental than theoretical understanding.
* &quot;Attunement&quot; is &quot;our way of finding ourselves thrust into the world&quot;. It can also be translated as &quot;disposition&quot; or &quot;affectedness&quot;. (The standard translation of Macquarrie and Robinson uses &quot;state-of-mind&quot;, but this misleadingly suggests a private mental state.) There is no perfect equivalent for Heidegger&#x27;s &quot;Befindlichkeit&quot;, which is not even an ordinary German word. What needs to be conveyed, however, is &quot;being found in a situation where things and opinions already matter&quot;.
* &quot;Discourse&quot; (sometimes: &quot;talk&quot; or &quot;telling&quot; [de:&quot;Rede&quot;]) is &quot;the articulation of the world into recognizable, communicable patterns of meaning.&quot; It is implicated in both understanding attunement: &quot;The world that is opened up by moods and grasped by understanding gets organized by discourse. Discourse makes language possible.&quot; According to Heidegger, &quot;Discourse is the articulation of intelligibility.&quot; In its most basic form, this referential whole manifests itself in the way things are told apart just in the course of using them.

Heidegger unifies these three existential features of Dasein in a composite structure he terms &quot;care&quot;: &quot;ahead-of-itself-being-already-in-(the-world) as being-amidst (entities encountered within-the-world).&quot; What unifies this formula is &quot;temporality&quot;. Understanding is oriented towards future possibilities, attunement is shaped by the past, and discourse discloses the present in those terms. In this way, the investigation into the being of Dasein leads to time. Much of Division II of &quot;Being and Time&quot; is devoted to a more fundamental reinterpretation of the findings of Division I in terms of Dasein&#x27;s temporality.

====&quot;Das Man&quot;====
As implied in the analysis of both attunement and discourse, Dasein is &quot;always already&quot;, or a priori, a social being. In Heidegger&#x27;s technical idiom, Dasein is &quot;Dasein-with&quot; (&quot;Mitsein&quot;), which he presents as equally primordial with &quot;being-one&#x27;s self&quot; (&quot;Selbstsein&quot;).

Heidegger&#x27;s term for this existential feature of Dasein is &quot;das Man&quot;, which is a German pronoun, &quot;man&quot;, that Heidegger turns into a noun. In English it is usually translated as either &quot;the they&quot; or &quot;the one&quot; (sometimes also capitalized); for, as Heidegger puts it, &quot;By &#x27;others&#x27; we do not mean everyone else but me... They are rather those from whom for the most part, one does &quot;not&quot; distinguish oneself—those among whom one is too&quot;. Quite frequently the term is just left in the German.

According to philosopher Hubert Dreyfus, part of Heidegger&#x27;s aim is to show that, contrary to Husserl, individuals do not generate an intersubjective world from their separate activities; rather, &quot;these activities &quot;presuppose&quot; the disclosure of one shared world.&quot; This is one way in which Heidegger breaks from the Cartesian tradition of beginning from the perspective of individual subjectivity.

Dreyfus argues that the chapter on &quot;das Man&quot; is &quot;the most confused&quot; in &quot;Being and Time&quot; and so is often misinterpreted. The problem, he says, is that Heidegger&#x27;s presentation conflates two opposing influences. The first is Dilthey&#x27;s account of the role that public and historical contexts have in the production of significance. The second is Kierkegaard&#x27;s insistence that truth is never to be found in the crowd.

The Diltheyian dimension of Heidegger&#x27;s analysis positions &quot;das Man&quot; as ontologically existential in the same way as understanding, affectedness, and discourse. This dimension of Heidegger&#x27;s analysis captures the way that a socio-historical &quot;background&quot; makes possible the specific significance that entities and activities can have. Philosopher Charles Taylor expands upon the term: &quot;It is that of which I am not simply unaware... but at the same time I cannot be said to be explicitly or focally aware of it, because that status is already occupied by what it is making intelligible&quot;. For this reason, background non-representationally informs and enables engaged agency in the world, but is something that people can never make fully explicit to themselves.

The Kierkegaardian influence on Heidegger&#x27;s analysis introduces a more existentialist dimension to &quot;Being and Time&quot;. (Existentialism is a broad philosophical movement largely defined by Jean-Paul Sartre and is not to be confused with Heidegger&#x27;s technical analysis of the specific existential features of Dasein.) Its central notion is &quot;authenticity&quot;, which emerges as a problem from the &quot;publicness&quot; built into the existential role of &quot;das Man&quot;. In Heidegger&#x27;s own words:

In this inconspicuousness and unascertainability, the real dictatorship of the &#x27;they&#x27; is unfolded. We take pleasure and enjoy ourselves as &quot;they&quot; take pleasure; we read, see and judge about literature and art as &quot;they&quot; see and judge; likewise we shrink back from the &#x27;great mass&#x27; as &quot;they&quot; shrink back; we find &#x27;shocking&#x27; what they find shocking. The &#x27;they&#x27;, which is nothing definite, and which we all are, through not as the sum, prescribes the kind of being of everydayness.

This &quot;dictatorship of &quot;das Man&quot;&quot; threatens to undermine Heidegger&#x27;s entire project of uncovering the meaning of being because it does not seem possible, from such a condition, to even raise the question of being that Heidegger claims to pursue. He responds to this challenge with his account of authenticity.

====Authenticity====
Heidegger&#x27;s term &quot;Eigentlichkeit&quot; is a neologism, in which Heidegger stresses the root &quot;eigen&quot;, meaning &quot;own.&quot; So this word, usually translated &quot;authenticity&quot;, could just as well be translated &quot;ownedness&quot; or &quot;being one&#x27;s own&quot;. Authenticity, according to Heidegger, is a matter of taking responsibility for being, that is, the stand that people take with respect to their ultimate projects. It is, in his terms, a matter of taking a properly &quot;resolute&quot; stand on &quot;for-the-sake-of-which&quot;. Put differently, the &quot;self&quot; to which one is true in authenticity is not something just &quot;there&quot; to be discovered, but instead is a matter of &quot;on-going narrative construction&quot;.

Scholars Somogy Varga and Charles Guignon describe three ways by which Dasein might attain an authentic relation to itself from out of its &quot;fallen&quot; condition as &quot;they&quot;-self. First, a powerful mood such as anxiety can disclose Dasein to itself as an ultimately isolated individual. Second, direct confrontation with Dasein&#x27;s &quot;ownmost&quot; potential for death can similarly disclose to Dasein its own irreducible finitude. Third, experiencing &quot;the call of conscience&quot; can disclose to Dasein its own &quot;guilt&quot; (&quot;Schuld&quot;) as the debt it has to itself in virtue of having taken over pre-given possibilities that it is now Dasein&#x27;s own responsibility to maintain.

Philosopher Michael E. Zimmerman describes authenticity as &quot;resolving to accept the openness which, paradoxically, one already is&quot;. He emphasizes that this is a matter, not of &quot;intellectual comprehension&quot;, but of &quot;hard-won insight&quot;. Authenticity is ultimately a matter of allowing the ego to be &quot;eclipsed by the manifestation of one&#x27;s finitude&quot;.

Although the term &quot;authenticity&quot; disappears from Heidegger&#x27;s writing after &quot;Being and Time&quot;, Zimmerman argues that it is supplanted in his later thought by the less subjective or voluntaristic notion of &quot;Ereignis&quot;. This ordinary German term for &quot;event&quot; or &quot;happening&quot; is theorized by Heidegger as the appropriation of Dasein into a cosmic play of concealment and appearance.

===Later works: The Turn===

Heidegger&#x27;s &quot;Turn&quot;, which is sometimes referred to by the German &quot;die Kehre&quot;, refers to a change in his work as early as 1930 that became clearly established by the 1940s, according to some commentators, who variously describe a shift of focus or a major change in outlook.

Heidegger himself frequently used the term to refer to the shift announced at the end of &quot;Being and Time&quot; from &quot;being and time&quot; to &quot;time and being&quot;. However, he rejected the existence of the &quot;sharp &#x27;about turn posited by some interpreters. Scholar Michael Inwood also calls attention to the fact that many of the ideas from &quot;Being and Time&quot; are retained in a different vocabulary in his later work—and also that, in other cases, a word or expression common throughout his career comes to acquire a different meaning in the later works.

This supposed shift—applied here to cover about 30 years of Heidegger&#x27;s 40-year writing career—has been described by commentators from widely varied viewpoints, for instance, from &quot;dwelling&quot; (being) in the world to &quot;doing&quot; (temporality) in the world. This aspect, in particular the 1951 essay &quot;Building Dwelling Thinking&quot;, has influenced several architectural theorists.

Other interpreters believe the Turn can be overstated or doesn&#x27;t exist at all. For instance, Thomas Sheehan believes this supposed change is &quot;far less dramatic than usually suggested&quot;, and entails merely a change in focus and method. Mark Wrathall argued that the Turn isn&#x27;t found in Heidegger&#x27;s writings, but is simply a misconception.

Some notable later works are &quot;The Origin of the Work of Art&quot; (1935), &quot;Contributions to Philosophy&quot; (1937), &quot;Letter on Humanism&quot; (1946), &quot;Building Dwelling Thinking&quot; (1951), &quot;The Question Concerning Technology&quot; (1954), and &quot;What Is Called Thinking?&quot; (1954).

===The history of being===
The idea of asking about being may be traced back via Aristotle to Parmenides. Heidegger claims to revive this question of being that had been largely forgotten by the metaphysical tradition extending from Plato to Descartes, a forgetfulness extending into the Age of Enlightenment, as well as modern science and technology. In pursuit of the retrieval of the question, Heidegger spends considerable time reflecting on ancient Greek thought, in particular on Plato, Parmenides, Heraclitus, and Anaximander.

In his later philosophy, Heidegger attempts to reconstruct the &quot;history of being&quot; in order to show how the different epochs in the history of philosophy were dominated by different conceptions of being. His goal is to retrieve the original experience of being present in the early Greek thought that was covered up by later philosophers.

According to W. Julian Korab-Karpowicz, Heidegger believed &quot;the thinking of Heraclitus and Parmenides, which lies at the origin of philosophy, was falsified and misinterpreted&quot; by Plato and Aristotle, thus tainting all of subsequent Western philosophy. In his &quot;Introduction to Metaphysics&quot;, Heidegger states, &quot;Among the most ancient Greek thinkers, it is Heraclitus who was subjected to the most fundamentally un-Greek misinterpretation in the course of Western history, and who nevertheless in more recent times has provided the strongest impulses toward redisclosing what is authentically Greek.&quot;

Charles Guignon writes that Heidegger aims to correct this misunderstanding by reviving Presocratic notions of being with an emphasis on &quot;understanding the way beings show up in (and as) an unfolding &quot;happening or event&quot;.&quot; Guignon adds that &quot;we might call this alternative outlook &#x27;event ontology.

===Language===
In &quot;Being and Time&quot;, language is presented as logically secondary to Dasein&#x27;s understanding of the world and its significance. On this conception of worldhood, language can develop from prelinguistic significance.

Post-turn, Heidegger refines his position to present some basic words (e.g., &quot;phusis&quot;, the Greek term that roughly translates to &quot;nature&quot;) as world-disclosive, that is, as establishing the foundational parameters in terms of which Dasein&#x27;s understanding can occur in the specific ways that it does. It is in this context that Heidegger proclaims that &quot;Language is the house of being.&quot;

In the present age, he says, the language of &quot;technology&quot;, or instrumental reason, flatten the significance of our world. For salvation, he turns to poetry.

Heidegger rejected the notion of language being purely a means of communication. Language construed us such, he believed, would form the basis of an age of technology, the digital thought processes of which would only use language to organise and communicate the coverage of that which exists. Thinking in terms of calculation and digital processing would put man at odds with language, at the centre of everything that exists. If man would believe that they would have language at their disposal, that they would be the one to use it, then, Heidegger believed, man would completely miss the core tenet of language itself: &quot;It is language that speaks, not man. Man only speaks if they neatly correspond to language.&quot; In this way, Heidegger wanted to point out that man is only a &quot;participant&quot; of language that they have not themselves created. Man is bound within a sort of process of transfer and may only &quot;act&quot; with respect to anything the language conveys.

In this, however, Heidegger does not think in terms of philosophy of culture: The tautology of the formulation &quot;language speaks&quot; (originally in German &quot;die Sprache spricht&quot;) is his way of trying to prevent the phenomenon of language to be used with respect to anything else than language itself. In line with his unique thinking, he is seeking to avoid having to justify the language by anything else. In this way, language could for instance never be explained by the sheer transmission of acoustic sounds, or speaking. According to Heidegger, language is rather difficult to fathom because we are too close to it, hence we need to speak about that which usually remains unmentioned because it is just to close to us. His work &quot;Unterwegs zur Sprache&quot; (&quot;On the way to language&quot;) is an attempt to reach &quot;a place we already are in.&quot;

=== Influences ===
Friedrich Nietzsche and Friedrich Hölderlin were both important influences on Heidegger, and many of his lecture courses were devoted to one or the other, especially in the 1930s and 1940s. The lectures on Nietzsche focused on fragments posthumously published under the title &quot;The Will to Power&quot;, rather than on Nietzsche&#x27;s published works. Heidegger reads &quot;The Will to Power&quot; as the culminating expression of Western metaphysics, and the lectures are a kind of dialogue between the two thinkers.

Michael Allen Gillespie says that Heidegger&#x27;s theoretical acceptance of &quot;destiny&quot; has much in common with the millenarianism of Marxism. But Marxists believe Heidegger&#x27;s &quot;theoretical acceptance is antagonistic to practical political activity and implies fascism&quot;. Gillespie, however, says &quot;the real danger&quot; from Heidegger isn&#x27;t quietism but fanaticism. Modernity has cast mankind toward a new goal &quot;on the brink of profound nihilism&quot; that is &quot;so alien it requires the construction of a new tradition to make it comprehensible.&quot;

Gillespie extrapolates from Heidegger&#x27;s writings that humankind may degenerate into &quot;scientists, workers, and brutes&quot;. According to Gillespie, Heidegger envisaged this abyss to be the greatest event in the history of the West because it might enable humanity to comprehend being more profoundly and primordially than the Presocratics.

The poetry of Friedrich Hölderlin became an increasingly central focus of Heidegger&#x27;s later work and thought. Heidegger grants Hölderlin a singular place within the history of being and the history of Germany, as a herald whose thought is yet to be &quot;heard&quot; in Germany or the West more generally. Many of Heidegger&#x27;s works from the 1930s onwards include meditations on lines from Hölderlin&#x27;s poetry, and several of the lecture courses are devoted to the reading of a single poem; for example, &quot;Hölderlin&#x27;s Hymn &quot;The Ister&quot;&quot;.

==Heidegger and the Nazi Party==

===The rectorate===

Adolf Hitler was sworn in as Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933. Heidegger was elected rector of the University of Freiburg on 21 April 1933, and assumed the position the following day. On 1 May, he joined the Nazi Party.

On 27 May 1933, Heidegger delivered his inaugural address, the &quot;Rektoratsrede&quot; (titled &quot;The Self-assertion of the German University&quot;), in a hall decorated with swastikas, with members of the Sturmabteilung (SA) and prominent Nazi Party officials present.

That summer he delivered a lecture on a fragment of Heraclitus (usually translated in English: &quot;War is the father of all&quot;). His notes on this lecture appear under the heading &quot;Struggle as the essence of Beings.&quot; In this lecture he suggests that if an enemy cannot be found for the people then one must be invented, and once conceptualized and identified, then the &#x27;beings&#x27; who have discovered or invented this enemy must strive for the total annihilation of the enemy.

His tenure as rector was fraught with difficulties from the outset. Some Nazi education officials viewed him as a rival, while others saw his efforts as comical. Some of Heidegger&#x27;s fellow Nazis also ridiculed his philosophical writings as gibberish. He finally offered his resignation as rector on 23 April 1934, and it was accepted on 27 April. Heidegger remained a member of both the academic faculty and of the Nazi Party until the end of the war.

Philosophical historian Hans Sluga wrote, &quot;Though as rector he prevented students from displaying an anti-Semitic poster at the entrance to the university and from holding a book burning, he kept in close contact with the Nazi student leaders and clearly signaled to them his sympathy with their activism.&quot;

In 1945, Heidegger wrote of his term as rector, giving the writing to his son Hermann; it was published in 1983:

The rectorate was an attempt to see something in the movement that had come to power, beyond all its failings and crudeness, that was much more far-reaching and that could perhaps one day bring a concentration on the Germans&#x27; Western historical essence. It will in no way be denied that at the time I believed in such possibilities and for that reason renounced the actual vocation of thinking in favor of being effective in an official capacity. In no way will what was caused by my own inadequacy in office be played down. But these points of view do not capture what is essential and what moved me to accept the rectorate.

===Treatment of Husserl===
Beginning in 1917, German-Jewish philosopher Edmund Husserl championed Heidegger&#x27;s work, and helped Heidegger become his successor for the chair in philosophy at the University of Freiburg in 1928.

On 6 April 1933, the Gauleiter of Baden Province, Robert Wagner, suspended all Jewish government employees, including present and retired faculty at the University of Freiburg. Heidegger&#x27;s predecessor as rector formally notified Husserl of his &quot;enforced leave of absence&quot; on 14 April 1933.

Heidegger became Rector of the University of Freiburg on 22 April 1933. The following week the national Reich law of 28 April 1933 replaced Reichskommissar Wagner&#x27;s decree. The Reich law required the firing of Jewish professors from German universities, including those, such as Husserl, who had converted to Christianity. The termination of the retired professor Husserl&#x27;s academic privileges thus did not involve any specific action on Heidegger&#x27;s part.

Heidegger had by then broken off contact with Husserl, other than through intermediaries. Heidegger later claimed that his relationship with Husserl had already become strained after Husserl publicly &quot;settled accounts&quot; with Heidegger and Max Scheler in the early 1930s.

Heidegger did not attend his former mentor&#x27;s cremation in 1938, for which he later declared himself regretful: &quot;That I failed to express again to Husserl my gratitude and respect for him upon the occasion of his final illness and death is a human failure that I apologized for in a letter to Mrs. Husserl&quot;. In 1941, under pressure from publisher Max Niemeyer, Heidegger agreed to remove the dedication to Husserl from &quot;Being and Time&quot; (restored in post-war editions).

Heidegger&#x27;s behavior towards Husserl has provoked controversy. Hannah Arendt initially suggested that Heidegger&#x27;s behavior precipitated Husserl&#x27;s death. She called Heidegger a &quot;potential murderer&quot;. However, she later recanted her accusation.

===Post-rectorate period===
After the failure of Heidegger&#x27;s rectorship, he withdrew from most political activity, but remained a member of the Nazi Party. In May 1934 he accepted a position on the Committee for the Philosophy of Law in the Academy for German Law, where he remained active until at least 1936. The academy had official consultant status in preparing Nazi legislation such as the Nuremberg racial laws that came into effect in 1935. In addition to Heidegger, such Nazi notables as Hans Frank, Julius Streicher, Carl Schmitt, and Alfred Rosenberg belonged to the Academy and served on this committee.

In a 1935 lecture, later published in 1953 as part of the book &quot;Introduction to Metaphysics&quot;, Heidegger refers to the &quot;inner truth and greatness&quot; of the Nazi movement, but he then adds a qualifying statement in parentheses: &quot;namely, the confrontation of planetary technology and modern humanity&quot;. However, it subsequently transpired that this qualification had not been made during the original lecture, although Heidegger claimed that it had been. This has led scholars to argue that Heidegger still supported the Nazi party in 1935 but that he did not want to admit this after the war, and so he attempted to silently correct his earlier statement.

In private notes written in 1939, Heidegger took a strongly critical view of Hitler&#x27;s ideology; however, in public lectures, he seems to have continued to make ambiguous comments which, if they expressed criticism of the regime, did so only in the context of praising its ideals. For instance, in a 1942 lecture, published posthumously, Heidegger said of recent German classics scholarship, &quot;In the majority of &quot;research results,&quot; the Greeks appear as pure National Socialists. This overenthusiasm on the part of academics seems not even to notice that with such &quot;results&quot; it does National Socialism and its historical uniqueness no service at all, not that it needs this anyhow.&quot;

An important witness to Heidegger&#x27;s continued allegiance to Nazism during the post-rectorship period is his former student Karl Löwith, who met Heidegger in 1936 while Heidegger was visiting Rome. In an account set down in 1940 (though not intended for publication), Löwith recalled that Heidegger wore a swastika pin to their meeting, though Heidegger knew that Löwith was Jewish. Löwith also recalled that Heidegger &quot;left no doubt about his faith in Hitler&quot;, and stated that his support for Nazism was in agreement with the essence of his philosophy.

Heidegger rejected the &quot;biologically grounded racism&quot; of the Nazis, replacing it with linguistic-historical heritage.

===Post-war period===
After the end of World War II, Heidegger was summoned to appear at a denazification hearing. Heidegger&#x27;s former student and lover Hannah Arendt spoke on his behalf at this hearing, while Karl Jaspers spoke against him. He was charged on four counts, dismissed from the university and declared a &quot;follower&quot; (&quot;Mitläufer&quot;) of Nazism. Heidegger was forbidden to teach between 1945 and 1951. One consequence of this teaching ban was that Heidegger began to engage far more in the French philosophical scene.

In his postwar thinking, Heidegger distanced himself from Nazism, but his critical comments about Nazism seem scandalous to some since they tend to equate the Nazi war atrocities with other inhumane practices related to rationalization and industrialisation, including the treatment of animals by factory farming. For instance in a lecture delivered at Bremen in 1949, Heidegger said: &quot;Agriculture is now a motorized food industry, the same thing in its essence as the production of corpses in the gas chambers and the extermination camps, the same thing as blockades and the reduction of countries to famine, the same thing as the manufacture of hydrogen bombs.&quot;

In 1967 Heidegger met with the Jewish poet Paul Celan, a concentration camp survivor. Having corresponded since 1956, Celan visited Heidegger at his country retreat and wrote an enigmatic poem about the meeting, which some interpret as Celan&#x27;s wish for Heidegger to apologize for his behavior during the Nazi era.

Heidegger&#x27;s defenders, notably Arendt, see his support for Nazism as arguably a personal &quot; &#x27;error&#x27; &quot; (a word which Arendt placed in quotation marks when referring to Heidegger&#x27;s Nazi-era politics). Defenders think this error was irrelevant to Heidegger&#x27;s philosophy. Critics such as Levinas, Karl Löwith, and Theodor Adorno claim that Heidegger&#x27;s support for Nazism revealed flaws inherent in his thought.

====&quot;Der Spiegel&quot; interview====
On 23 September 1966, Heidegger was interviewed by Georg Wolff, a former Nazi, and Rudolf Augstein for &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; magazine, in which he agreed to discuss his political past provided that the interview be published posthumously. (&quot;Only a God Can Save Us&quot; was published five days after his death, on 31 May 1976.) In the interview, Heidegger defended his entanglement with Nazism in two ways. First, he claimed that there was no alternative, saying that with his acceptance of the position of rector of the University of Freiburg he was trying to save the university (and science in general) from being politicized and thus had to compromise with the Nazi administration. Second, he admitted that he saw an &quot;awakening&quot; (&quot;Aufbruch&quot;) which might help to find a &quot;new national and social approach,&quot; but said that he changed his mind about this in 1934, when he refused, under threat of dismissal, to remove from the position of dean of the faculty those who were not acceptable to the Nazi party, and he consequently decided to resign as rector.

In his interview Heidegger defended as double-speak his 1935 lecture describing the &quot;inner truth and greatness of this movement.&quot; He affirmed that Nazi informants who observed his lectures would understand that by &quot;movement&quot; he meant Nazism. However, Heidegger asserted that his dedicated students would know this statement wasn&#x27;t praise for the Nazi Party. Rather, he meant it as he expressed it in the parenthetical clarification later added to &quot;Introduction to Metaphysics&quot; (1953), namely, &quot;the confrontation of planetary technology and modern humanity.&quot;

The eyewitness account of Löwith from 1940, contradicts the account given in the &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; interview in two ways: that he did not make any decisive break with Nazism in 1934, and that Heidegger was willing to entertain more profound relations between his philosophy and political involvement. The &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; interviewers did not bring up Heidegger&#x27;s 1949 quotation comparing the industrialization of agriculture to the extermination camps. In fact, the interviewers were not in possession of much of the evidence now known for Heidegger&#x27;s Nazi sympathies. Furthermore, &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; journalist Georg Wolff had been an SS-Hauptsturmführer with the Sicherheitsdienst, stationed in Oslo during World War II, and had been writing articles with antisemitic and racist overtones in &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; since the end of the war.

====The Farías debate====
Jacques Derrida, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, and Jean-François Lyotard, among others, all engaged in debate and disagreement about the relation between Heidegger&#x27;s philosophy and his Nazi politics. These debates included the question of whether it was possible to do without Heidegger&#x27;s philosophy, a position which Derrida in particular rejected. Forums where these debates took place include the proceedings of the first conference dedicated to Derrida&#x27;s work, published as &quot;&quot;Les Fins de l&#x27;homme à partir du travail de Jacques Derrida: colloque de Cerisy, 23 juillet-2 août 1980&quot;, Derrida&#x27;s &quot;Feu la cendre/cio&#x27; che resta del fuoco&quot;&quot;, and the studies on Paul Celan by Lacoue-Labarthe and Derrida, which shortly preceded the detailed studies of Heidegger&#x27;s politics published in and after 1987.

==== The Black Notebooks ====
In 2014, Heidegger&#x27;s &quot;Black Notebooks&quot; were published although he had written in them between 1931 and the early 1970s. The notebooks contain several examples of anti-Semitic sentiments, which have led to reevaluation of Heidegger&#x27;s relation to Nazism. An example of Heidegger using anti-Semitic language he once wrote &quot;world Judaism is ungraspable everywhere and doesn&#x27;t need to get involved in military action while continuing to unfurl its influence, whereas we are left to sacrifice the best blood of the best of our people&quot;. The term and notion of &quot;world Judaism&quot; was first promoted by the anti-Semitic text The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and later appeared in Hitler&#x27;s infamous book &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. In another instance Heidegger wrote &quot;by living according to the principle of race [Jews] had themselves promoted the very reasoning by which they were now being attacked and so they had no right to complain when it was being used against them by the Germans promoting their own racial purity&quot;. However, in the notebooks there are instances of Heidegger writing critically of Biological racism and biological oppression.

A notable entry in the notebooks are his writings about his mentor and former friend Edmund Husserl specifically relating to Husserl Jewish heritage. In 1939, only a year after Husserl&#x27;s death, Heidegger wrote in his &quot;Black Notebooks&quot;:

the occasional increase in the power of Judaism is grounded in the fact that Western metaphysics, especially in
its modern evolution, offered the point of attachment for the expansion of an otherwise empty rationality and calculative capacity, and these thereby created for themselves an abode in the &quot;spirit&quot; without ever being able, on their own, to grasp the concealed decisive domains. The more originary and inceptual the future decisions and questions become, all the more inaccessible will they remain to this &#x27;race.&#x27; (Thus Husserl&#x27;s step to the phenomenological attitude, taken in explicit opposition to psychological explanation and to the historiological calculation of opinions, will be of lasting importance—and yet this attitude never reaches into the domains of the essential decisions[...].)

This would seem to imply that Heidegger considered Husserl to be philosophically limited by his Jewishness.

== Reception ==

===Influence===
Heidegger is often considered to be among the most important and influential philosophers of the 20th century by many observers. American Philosopher Richard Rorty has ranked Heidegger as among the most important philosophers along with John Dewey and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Simon Critchley has praised Heidegger as the &quot;most important and influential philosopher in the continental tradition in the 20th century&quot;.

Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek has referred to Heidegger as a &quot;great philosopher&quot; and rejected the notion that his alleged anti-semitism against him tainted his philosophy.

In France, there is a very long and particular history of reading and interpreting Heidegger&#x27;s work. Because Heidegger&#x27;s discussion of ontology is sometimes interpreted as rooted in an analysis of the mode of existence of individual human beings (Dasein), his work has often been associated with existentialism. Derrida sees deconstruction is a tradition inherited via Heidegger (the French term &quot;&quot;déconstruction&quot; is a term coined to translate Heidegger&#x27;s use of the words &quot;Destruktion&quot;&quot;—literally &quot;destruction&quot;—and &quot;Abbau&quot;—more literally &quot;de-building&quot;). The influence of Heidegger on Sartre&#x27;s 1943 &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot; is marked. Heidegger himself, however, argued that Sartre had misread his work.

Hubert Dreyfus introduced Heidegger&#x27;s notion of &quot;being-in-the-world&quot; to research in Artificial intelligence. According to Dreyfus, long-standing research questions such as the Frame problem can be only dissolved within an Heideggerian framework. Heidegger also profoundly influenced Enactivism and Situated robotics. Former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon has expressed admiration for Heidegger and has praised his philosophy.

Some writers on Heidegger&#x27;s work see possibilities within it for dialogue with traditions of thought outside of Western philosophy, particularly East Asian thinking. Despite perceived differences between Eastern and Western philosophy, some of Heidegger&#x27;s later work, particularly &quot;A Dialogue on Language between a Japanese and an Inquirer&quot;, does show an interest in initiating such a dialogue. Heidegger himself had contact with a number of leading Japanese intellectuals, including members of the Kyoto School, notably Hajime Tanabe and Kuki Shūzō. The scholar Chang Chung-Yuan stated, &quot;Heidegger is the only Western Philosopher who not only intellectually understands Tao, but has intuitively experienced the essence of it as well.&quot; Philosopher Reinhard May sees great influence of Taoism and Japanese scholars in Heidegger&#x27;s work, although this influence is not acknowledged by the author. He asserts it can be shown that Heidegger sometimes &quot;appropriated wholesale and almost verbatim major ideas from the German translations of Daoist and Zen Buddhist classics.&quot; To this he adds, &quot;This clandestine textual appropriation of non-Western spirituality, the extent of which has gone undiscovered for so long, seems quite unparalleled, with far-reaching implications for our future interpretation of Heidegger&#x27;s work.&quot;

Notable figures known to be influenced by Heidegger&#x27;s work today include Aleksandr Dugin, a prominent Russian far-right political philosopher.

=== Criticism ===
According to Husserl, &quot;Being and Time&quot; claimed to deal with ontology, but only did so in the first few pages of the book. Having nothing further to contribute to an ontology independent of human existence, Heidegger changed the topic to Dasein. Whereas Heidegger argued that the question of human existence is central to the pursuit of the question of being, Husserl criticized this as reducing phenomenology to &quot;philosophical anthropology&quot; and offering an abstract and incorrect portrait of the human being. Aspects of his work have been criticized by those who acknowledge his influence. Some questions raised about Heidegger&#x27;s philosophy include the priority of ontology, the status of animals, the nature of the religious, Heidegger&#x27;s supposed neglect of ethics (Emmanuel Levinas), the body (Maurice Merleau-Ponty), sexual difference (Luce Irigaray), and space (Peter Sloterdijk). A. J. Ayer objected that Heidegger proposed vast, overarching theories regarding existence that were completely unverifiable through empirical demonstration and logical analysis.

In France, there is a very long and particular history of reading and interpreting Heidegger. In 1929 the Neo-Kantian Ernst Cassirer and Heidegger engaged in an influential debate, during the Second Davos Hochschulkurs in Davos, concerning the significance of Kantian notions of freedom and rationality. Whereas Cassirer defended the role of rationality in Kant, Heidegger argued for the priority of the imagination.The reception of Heidegger&#x27;s philosophy by Anglo-American analytic philosophy, beginning with the logical positivists, was almost uniformly negative. Rudolf Carnap accused Heidegger of offering an &quot;illusory&quot; ontology, criticizing him for committing the fallacy of reification and for wrongly dismissing the logical treatment of language which, according to Carnap, can only lead to writing &quot;nonsensical pseudo-propositions&quot;.

Hegelian-Marxist thinkers, especially György Lukács and the Frankfurt School, associated the style and content of Heidegger&#x27;s thought with irrationalism and criticized its political implications. For instance, Theodor Adorno wrote an extended critique of the ideological character of Heidegger&#x27;s early and later use of language in the &quot;Jargon of Authenticity&quot;, and Jürgen Habermas admonishes the influence of Heidegger on recent French philosophy in his polemic against &quot;postmodernism&quot; in &quot;The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity&quot;.

Bertrand Russell considered Heidegger an obscurantist, writing, &quot;Highly eccentric in its terminology, his philosophy is extremely obscure. One cannot help suspecting that language is here running riot. An interesting point in his speculations is the insistence that nothingness is something positive. As with much else in Existentialism, this is a psychological observation made to pass for logic.&quot; According to Richard Polt, this quote expresses the sentiments of many 20th-century analytic philosophers concerning Heidegger.

==In film==
* &quot;Der Zauberer von Meßkirch&quot; (1989) is a German TV documentary about Heidegger, co-directed by Ulrich Boehm and Rüdiger Safranski.
* The film director Terrence Malick translated Heidegger&#x27;s 1929 essay &quot;Vom Wesen des Grundes&quot; into English. It was published under the title &quot;The Essence of Reasons&quot; (1969). It is also frequently said of Malick that his cinema has Heideggerian sensibilities.
* &quot;The Ister&quot; (2004) is a film based on Heidegger&#x27;s 1942 lecture course on Friedrich Hölderlin, and features Jean-Luc Nancy, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, Bernard Stiegler, and Hans-Jürgen Syberberg.
* &quot;Being in the World&quot; (2010) draws on Heidegger&#x27;s work to explore what it means to be human in a technological age. A number of Heidegger scholars are interviewed, including Hubert Dreyfus, Mark Wrathall, Albert Borgmann, John Haugeland, and Taylor Carman.

<text>A political prisoner is someone imprisoned for their political activity. The political offense is not always the official reason for the prisoner&#x27;s detention.

There is no internationally recognized legal definition of the concept, although numerous similar definitions have been proposed by various organizations and scholars, and there is a general consensus among scholars that &quot;individuals have been sanctioned by legal systems and imprisoned by political regimes not for their violation of codified laws but for their thoughts and ideas that have fundamentally challenged existing power relations&quot;. The status of a political prisoner is generally awarded to individuals based on the declarations of non-governmental organizations like Amnesty International, on a case-by-case basis. While such statuses are often widely recognized by the international public, they are often rejected by individual governments accused of holding political prisoners, which tend to deny any bias in their judicial systems.

A related term is prisoner of conscience (POC), popularized by Amnesty International. It describes someone who was prosecuted because of their personal beliefs.

Some prisons, known as political prisons, are accustomed to or are designed solely for hosting political prisoners.

==Definitions==
The concept of a political prisoner, like many concepts in social sciences, sports numerous definitions, and is undefined in international law and human right treaties. Helen Taylor Greene and Shaun L. Gabbidon in 2009 that &quot;standard legal definitions have remained elusive&quot;, but at the same time, observing that there is a general consensus that &quot;individuals have been sanctioned by legal systems and imprisoned by political regimes not for their violation of codified laws but for their thoughts and ideas that have fundamentally challenged existing power relations&quot;.

A number of organizations involved in human rights issues, as well as scholars studying them, have developed their own definitions, some of which are presented below.

===Organizations===
====Amnesty International====
Amnesty International (AI) campaigns for the release of prisoners of conscience, which include both political prisoners as well as those imprisoned for their religious or philosophical beliefs. To reduce controversy, and as a matter of principle, the organization&#x27;s policy applies only to prisoners who have not committed or advocated violence. Thus, there are political prisoners who do not fit the narrower criteria for POCs. The organisation defines the differences as follows:

AI uses the term &quot;political prisoner&quot; broadly. It does not use it, as some others do, to imply that all such prisoners have a special status or should be released. It uses the term only to define a category of prisoners for whom AI demands a fair and prompt trial.

In AI&#x27;s usage, the term includes any prisoner whose case contains a significant political element, in regard to the motivation of the prisoner&#x27;s acts, the acts themselves, or the motivation of the authorities.

&quot;Political&quot; is used by AI to refer to aspects of human relations related to &quot;politics&quot;: the mechanisms of society and civil order, the principles, organization, or conduct of government or public affairs, and the relation of all these to questions of language, ethnic origin, sex or religion, status, or influence (among other factors).

The category of political prisoners embraces the category of prisoners of conscience, the only prisoners who AI demands should be immediately and unconditionally released, as well as people who resort to criminal violence for a political motive.

In AI&#x27;s use of the term, here are some examples of political prisoners:
* a person accused or convicted of an ordinary crime carried out for political motives, such as murder or robbery carried out to support the objectives of an opposition group;
* a person accused or convicted of an ordinary crime committed in a political context, such as at a demonstration by a trade union or a peasants&#x27; organization;
* a member or suspected member of an armed opposition group who has been charged with treason or &quot;subversion&quot;.

Governments often say they have no political prisoners, only prisoners held under the normal criminal law. AI however describes cases like the examples given above as &quot;political&quot; and uses the terms &quot;political trial&quot; and &quot;political imprisonment&quot; when referring to them. But by doing so, AI does not oppose the imprisonment, except where it further maintains that the prisoner is a prisoner of conscience, or condemn the trial, except where it concludes that it was unfair.
====Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe====
The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has the following definition:

A person deprived of their personal liberty is to be regarded as a &#x27;political prisoner&#x27;:

====Assistance Association for Political Prisoners====
Burmese Assistance Association for Political Prisoners defines a political prisoner as &quot;anyone who is arrested because of [their] perceived or real involvement in or supporting role in opposition movements with peaceful or resistance means&quot;.

==== Congressional-Executive Commission on China ====
The US Congressional-Executive Commission on China defines a political prisoner broadly as any individual who is detained for exercising their &quot;human rights under international law, such as peaceable assembly, freedom of religion, freedom of association, free expression, including the freedom to advocate peaceable social or political change, and to criticize government policy or government officials.&quot;

=== Academics ===
==== Steinert (2020) ====
Christoph Valentin Steinert, who in 2020 reviewed 366 definitions of political prisoners used in (mainly English language) academic literature in 1956 and 2019, argued that any definition of political prisoner needs to avoid focusing on prisoners&#x27; individual motivations and that the term &quot;should be exclusively reserved for victims of politically biased trials&quot; (in other words, &quot;victims of state repression&quot;), to avoid delegitimizing the term by diluting it with applications to prisoners of any possibly politically motivated action (which on the extreme end of the spectrum would include, for example, Ku Klux Klanners, neo-Nazis, and jihadist terrorists). He specifically criticizes definitions of political prisoners as &quot;individuals imprisoned for politically motivated actions&quot; or &quot;committing a political offense&quot;. He proposed the following definition:
Political prisoners are defined as individuals that are convicted and incarcerated in politically biased trials (or executive decisions in the absence of any trials). Trials are deemed politically biased if they are endorsed by the government and (a) lack a domestic legal basis, (b) violate principles of procedural justice, or (c) violate universal human rights.
Steinert noted that his definition does extend to prisoners &quot;imprisoned for nonpolitical identities such as their religious beliefs or their sexual orientations&quot;, as well as individuals engaged in violent actions, arguing that the neutral &quot;classification as a political prisoner neither entails an a priori judgment about the moral legitimacy of prisoners&#x27; actions nor does it imply that individuals committed politically motivated crimes&quot;.

===Other aspects===
The purpose of political prisons and of imprisoning dissidents is to demonstrate the strength of the regime to the dissidents. The regime&#x27;s opponents are isolated, and stigmatised, frequently abused, and tortured. The goal of such treatment is not just to punish those opposing the regime, but to frighten those who consider opposing the regime by demonstrating the power of the regime by sending a clear warning that objecting is not tolerated, and that the regime is well prepared and ready to punish the objectors through the creation of total institutions dedicated to hosting political prisoners.

The status of a political prisoner is conveyed to one only after their detention. Before that, potential political prisoners may be referred to as &quot;dissidents, revolutionaries, social reformers, or radical thinkers&quot;. The nature of the behavior that leads to political imprisonment is hard to define and can be roughly described as any &quot;activity deemed questionable by ruling elites&quot;. Therefore, political prisoners may be officially detained and sentenced for a multitude of different transgressions, rather than a single well-defined crime. Political prisoners are frequently arrested and tried with a veneer of legality where false criminal charges, manufactured evidence, and unfair trials (kangaroo courts, show trials) are used to disguise the fact that an individual is a political prisoner. For example, AAPP states that &quot;the motivation behind the arrest of every individual in AAPP&#x27;s database is political, regardless of the laws they have been sentenced under&quot;. This is common in situations which may otherwise be decried nationally and internationally as a human rights violation or suppression of a political dissident. Steinert notes that &quot;objective evidence about politically biased imprisonments is chronically sparse considering that governments face substantial incentives to hide repressive practices&quot;. As a rule, governments deny imprisoning individuals for their political activities.

A political prisoner can also be someone who has been denied bail unfairly, denied parole when it would reasonably have been given to a prisoner charged with a comparable crime, or special powers may be invoked by the judiciary. Particularly in this latter situation, whether an individual is regarded as a political prisoner may depend upon the subjective political perspective or interpretation of the evidence. Political prisoners can also be imprisoned with no legal veneer by extrajudicial processes or even through executive decisions in the absence of any trials or charges. Some political prisoners need not be imprisoned at all, as they can be subject to prolonged pre-trial detainment instead. Steinert noted that technically, political detainees should be distinguished from political prisoners, but they are often grouped together, and in practical terms, he recommends treating them as &quot;special types&quot; of political prisoners. Examples of such detainees can include individuals such as the former Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, detained for many years without a trial. Likewise, supporters of Tibetan spiritual leader Gedhun Choekyi Nyima in the 11th Panchen Lama controversy have called him a &quot;political prisoner&quot;, despite the fact that he is not accused of a political offense. He is held under secluded house arrest.

Political prisoners may become the subjects of international advocacy and receive aid from various non-governmental organizations. Criticism from the international public opinion has been shown to facilitate the release of political detainees, or reduce their sentences, but is less effective in securing the release of already-sentenced individuals. When the status of political prisoner is well known, it can be seen as a form of status symbol. Some political prisoners purposefully frame themselves as &quot;the imprisoned martyrs and leaders of their movement.&quot; Which can safeguard their well-being in prison.

== History ==
Ancient Greek philosopher Socrates has been described as perhaps the earliest known political prisoner; imprisoned for allegedly &quot;poisoning&quot; the minds of Grecian youth through his critique of Athenian society and its rulers. Early Christians, including Jesus Christ, and St. Peter, have also been described as such. Another famous historical figure described as a political prisoner is the 15th century French heroine, Joan of Arc, whose final charge of heresy was seen as a legal justification for her real crime of &quot;inconveniencing the elites&quot;.

Padraic Kenney noted that &quot;the emergence of modern political prisoners coincides with a fifty-year period (1860s–1910s) during which [modern] political movements matured around the world&quot;, also defining such movements as having &quot;clearly articulated political and social programs&quot; which forced the governments to develop a specific response to such movements (a response which often involved incarceration rather than dialogue, particularly under the less liberal regimes).

In some places, political prisoners had their own customs, traditions, and semi-formal organizations and privileges; historically, this has been more common up to around the interwar period, as the many political prisoners came from higher social classes (in particular, nobility), and authorities often treated them better than common criminals. This changed with the emergence of the totalitarian regimes that were intent on annihilating the opposition.

In Poland, the concept and even traditions of political prisoners emerged around the second half of the 19th century in the Russian partition.

While the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 is not legally binding, it is generally recognized as &quot;a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations&quot;. Of particular relevance to political prisoners are its Articles 5, 6, 9 and 18. The UDHR and the later Helsinki Accords of 1975 have been used by a number of nongovernmental organizations as the basis for arguing that some governments are in fact holding political prisoners.

In the United States, the term political prisoner has been used during the mid-20th century civil rights struggle and has been occasionally applied to individuals like Rosa Parks or Martin Luther King Jr., and later used for individuals imprisoned for objecting to US involvement in the Vietnam War.

Political prisoners sometimes write memoirs of their experiences and resulting insights. Some of these memoirs have become important political texts. For example, King&#x27;s &quot;Letter From a Birmingham City Jail&quot; has been described as &quot;one of the most important historical documents penned by a modern political prisoner&quot;.

== Advocacy ==
A number of nongovernmental organizations focus on advocacy for political prisoners. The most prominent of those is Amnesty International, founded in 1961.

<doc id="37308" wikidata="Q7314355" url="?curid=37308" title="Reptilia (zoo)">
<text>Reptilia is a collection of Canada&#x27;s largest indoor reptile zoos, with a combined area of over of indoor exhibits featuring over 250 reptiles, amphibians and arachnids.

Currently there are three Ontario locations, one in Vaughan, one in Whitby, and one in London.

==Locations==
The original Reptilia zoo was established in Vaughan and is housed in a facility. In 2018, it opened a second location in Whitby in a former Rona store. In late 2018, it announced plans to create similar zoos in London and Barrie. London City Council rejected the proposal for a reptile zoo in Westmount Mall. However, the council later reversed course in 2022 and allowed the company to open at Westmount Mall.

==Attractions==


About 250 species of reptiles are in the zoo&#x27;s collection. Among them is Canada&#x27;s largest crocodile, a , male Nile crocodile named Induna. The zoo also contains pythons, anacondas, poison dart frogs, rattlesnakes, and more. About 75% of animals are rescues, with the remainder either born on location or acquired from other accredited facilities. Of the rescues, many are obtained from previous owners who cannot cope with animals that have achieved their adult size, for which the zoo receives &quot;constant calls&quot;. The zoo takes in about 75 such animals every year, many of which are later sent to other facilities.

Each location has a theatre area in which the zoo exhibits interactive reptile shows.

==Educational curriculum==
Reptilia provides curriculum compliant educational programs from kindergarten to grade 12 along with specialized post secondary programs for first responders, educators, animal control officers and veterinarians. Educational programs are provided at Reptilia, as well as through the transportation of reptiles to various schools to provide lessons in school classrooms. Lessons are typically of 1 hour duration.

Reptilia interacts closely with other educational organizations, supplying reptiles and other supplies to the Ontario Science Centre, helping the Toronto Zoo with their educational programs, and working with many of the schools in the Greater Toronto Area. Reptilia also has a number of classrooms and party rooms that can be rented out for activities such as birthday parties. Each room is named after a different reptile.

==Film industry==
Reptilia provides reptiles along with skilled handlers for film productions, photo shoots, and television. Reptilia has provided reptiles for Guinness, Murdoch Mysteries, Canada&#x27;s Greatest Know-It-All, YTV, Daily Planet, and other shows and productions.

<text>Federal Standard 1037C, titled Telecommunications: Glossary of Telecommunication Terms, is a United States Federal Standard issued by the General Services Administration pursuant to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended.

This document provides federal departments and agencies a comprehensive source of definitions of terms used in telecommunications and directly related fields by international and U.S. government telecommunications specialists.

As a publication of the U.S. government, prepared by an agency of the U.S. government, it appears to be mostly available as a public domain resource, but a few items are derived from copyrighted sources: where this is the case, there is an attribution to the source.

This standard was superseded in 2001 by American National Standard T1.523-2001, Telecom Glossary 2000, which is published by ATIS. The old standard is still frequently used, because the new standard is protected by copyright, as usual for ANSI standards.

A newer proposed standard is the &quot;ATIS Telecom Glossary 2011&quot;, ATIS-0100523.2011.

<doc id="37313" wikidata="Q16397" url="?curid=37313" title="Bruce Lee">
<text>Bruce Lee (born Lee Jun-fan; November 27, 1940 – July 20, 1973) was a Hong Kong-American martial artist, actor, filmmaker, and philosopher. He was the founder of Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial arts philosophy which was formed from Lee&#x27;s experiences in unarmed fighting and self-defense—as well as eclectic, Zen Buddhist and Taoist philosophies—as a new school of martial arts thought. With a film career spanning Hong Kong and the United States, Lee is regarded as the first global Chinese film star and one of the most influential martial artists in the history of cinema. Known for his roles in five feature-length martial arts films, Lee is credited with helping to popularize martial arts films in the 1970s and promoting Hong Kong action cinema.

Born in San Francisco and raised in British Hong Kong, Lee was introduced to the Hong Kong film industry as a child actor by his father. His early martial arts experience included Wing Chun (trained under Ip Man), tai chi, boxing (winning a Hong Kong boxing tournament), and frequent street fighting (neighborhood and rooftop fights). In 1959, Lee moved to Seattle, where he enrolled at the University of Washington in 1961. It was during this time in the United States that he began considering making money by teaching martial arts, even though he aspired to have a career in acting. He opened his first martial arts school, operated out of his home in Seattle. After later adding a second school in Oakland, California, he once drew significant attention at the 1964 Long Beach International Karate Championships of California by making demonstrations and speaking. He subsequently moved to Los Angeles to teach, where his students included Chuck Norris, Sharon Tate, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. 

His roles in America, including playing Kato in &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; introduced him to American audiences, but the cultural frictions that existed did not allow Lee to fully express himself. After returning to Hong Kong in 1971, Lee landed his first leading role in &quot;The Big Boss&quot;, directed by Lo Wei. A year later he starred in &quot;Fist of Fury&quot;, in which he portrayed Chen Zhen, and &quot;The Way of the Dragon&quot;, directed and written by Lee. He went on to star in the US-Hong Kong co-production &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Game of Death&quot; (1978). His Hong Kong and Hollywood-produced films, all of which were commercially successful, elevated Hong Kong martial arts films to a new level of popularity and acclaim, sparking a surge of Western interest in Chinese martial arts. The direction and tone of his films, including their fight choreography and diversification, dramatically influenced and changed martial arts and martial arts films worldwide. With his influence, kung fu films began to displace the wuxia film genre—fights were choreographed more realistically, fantasy elements were discarded for real-world conflicts, and the characterisation of the male lead went from simply being a chivalrous hero to one that embodied the notion of masculinity.

Lee&#x27;s career was cut short by his sudden death at age 32 from a brain edema, the causes of which remain a matter of dispute. Nevertheless, his films remained popular, gained a large cult following, and became widely imitated and exploited. He became an iconic figure known throughout the world, particularly among the Chinese, based upon his portrayal of Cantonese culture in his films, and among Asian Americans for defying Asian stereotypes in the United States. Since his death, Lee has continued to be a prominent influence on modern combat sports, including judo, karate, mixed martial arts, and boxing, as well as modern popular culture, including film, television, comics, animation, and video games. &quot;Time&quot; named Lee one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century.

== Early life ==
Bruce Lee&#x27;s birth name was Lee Jun-fan.
His father, Lee Hoi-chuen, was a Cantonese opera singer based in Hong Kong. His mother Grace Ho was born in Shanghai, and she was of Eurasian ancestry. In December 1939, his parents traveled to California for an international opera tour in Chinatown, San Francisco. He was born there on November 27, 1940. His birth in the U.S. allowed him to claim U.S. citizenship due to the United States&#x27; &quot;jus soli&quot; citizenship laws. When he was four months old (April 1941), the Lee family returned to Hong Kong. Soon after, the Lee family experienced unexpected hardships as Japan, amid World War II, launched a surprise attack on Hong Kong in December 1941 and ruled the city for the next four years.

Lee&#x27;s maternal grandfather was Cantonese, his maternal grandmother was English, and his maternal great-uncle, Robert Hotung, was a Hong Kong businessman of Dutch Jewish and Cantonese descent.

== Career and education ==

=== 1940–1958: Early roles, schooling and martial arts initiation ===
Lee&#x27;s father Lee Hoi-chuen was a Cantonese opera star. As a result, Junior Lee was introduced to the world of cinema at a very young age and appeared in several films as a child. Lee had his first role as a baby who was carried onto the stage in the film &quot;Golden Gate Girl&quot;. He took his Chinese stage name as 李小龍, lit. &quot;Lee the Little Dragon&quot;, for the fact that he was born in both the hour and the year of the Dragon by the Chinese zodiac.

At age seven, Lee began practicing tai chi together with his father. As a nine-year-old, he co-starred with his father in &quot;The Kid&quot; in 1950, which was based on a comic book character, &quot;Kid Cheung&quot;, and was his first leading role. By the time he was 18, he had appeared in 20 films. After attending Tak Sun School (; several blocks from his home at 218 Nathan Road, Kowloon), Lee entered the primary school division of the Catholic La Salle College at age 12.

In the early 1950s, Lee&#x27;s father became an opium addict. In 1956, due to poor academic performance (and possibly poor conduct), Lee was transferred to St. Francis Xavier&#x27;s College. He was mentored by Brother Edward Muss, F.M.S., a Bavarian-born teacher and coach of the school boxing team.

In 1953, Lee&#x27;s friend William Cheung introduced him to Ip Man. According to Cheung, Lee&#x27;s European background on his mother&#x27;s side led him to be rejected, initially, from learning Wing Chun kung fu under Ip Man because of the long-standing rule in the Chinese martial arts world not to teach foreigners. Cheung spoke on his behalf and Lee was accepted into the school and began training in Wing Chun with Ip Man. Ip tried to keep his students from fighting in the street gangs of Hong Kong by encouraging them to fight in organized competitions.

After a year of his training with Ip Man, most of the other students refused to train with Lee. They had learned of his mixed ancestry, and the Chinese were generally against teaching their martial arts techniques to non-Asians. Lee&#x27;s sparring partner, Hawkins Cheung, states, &quot;Probably fewer than six people in the whole Wing Chun clan were personally taught, or even partly taught, by Ip Man&quot;. However, Lee showed a keen interest in Wing Chun and continued to train privately with Ip Man, William Cheung, and Wong Shun-leung.

In 1958, Lee won the Hong Kong schools boxing tournament, knocking out the previous champion, Gary Elms, in the final. That year, Lee was also a cha-cha dancer, winning Hong Kong&#x27;s Crown Colony Cha-Cha Championship.

=== 1959–1964: Move to Seattle ===
In his late teens, Lee&#x27;s street fights became more frequent and included beating the son of a feared triad family. In 1958, after students from a rival Choy Li Fut martial arts school challenged Lee&#x27;s Wing Chun school, he engaged in a fight on a rooftop. In response to an unfair punch by another boy, he beat him so badly that he knocked out one of his teeth, leading to the boy&#x27;s parents making a complaint to the police.

Lee&#x27;s mother had to go to a police station and sign a document saying that she would take full responsibility for his actions if they released him into her custody. Though she did not mention the incident to her husband, she suggested that her son return to the United States to claim his U.S. citizenship at the age of 18. Lee&#x27;s father agreed as Lee&#x27;s college prospects were not very promising if he remained in Hong Kong.
In April 1959, Lee&#x27;s parents decided to send him to the United States to stay with his older sister, Agnes Lee (), who was already living with family friends in San Francisco. After several months, he moved to Seattle in 1959 to continue his high school education, where he also worked for Ruby Chow as a live-in waiter at her restaurant. Chow&#x27;s husband was a co-worker and friend of Lee&#x27;s father. Lee&#x27;s elder brother Peter Lee () joined him in Seattle for a short stay, before moving on to Minnesota to attend college.

In 1959, Lee started to teach martial arts. He called what he taught Jun Fan Gung Fu (literally Bruce Lee&#x27;s Kung Fu). It was his approach to Wing Chun. Lee taught friends he met in Seattle, starting with Judo practitioner Jesse Glover, who continued to teach some of Lee&#x27;s early techniques. Lee&#x27;s early student group was the most racially diverse group of practitioners of Chinese martial arts until that time. During this time period, Lee invented his one-inch punch. He also became interested in boxing and the techniques of Muhammad Ali and Sugar Ray Robinson.

Taky Kimura became Lee&#x27;s first Assistant Instructor and continued to teach his art and philosophy after Lee&#x27;s death. Lee opened his first martial arts school, named the Lee Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute, in Seattle.

Lee completed his high school education and received his diploma from Edison Technical School on Capitol Hill in Seattle.

In March 1961, Lee enrolled at the University of Washington. Despite what Lee himself and many others have stated, Lee&#x27;s official major was drama rather than philosophy, according to a 1999 article in the university&#x27;s alumni publication. In his junior year, he took two classes in psychology and two classes in philosophy; both of these became core interests for him for the rest of his life. He socialized with wealthy young people, but lived in relative poverty and worked as a dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant.

===1964-1965: Oakland===
Lee dropped out of university in early 1964 and moved to Oakland to live with James Yimm Lee. James Lee was twenty years senior to Lee and a well-known Chinese martial artist in the area. Together, they founded the second Jun Fan martial arts studio in Oakland. James Lee was responsible for introducing Lee to Ed Parker, an American martial artist. At the invitation of Parker, Lee appeared in the 1964 Long Beach International Karate Championships. He performed repetitions of two-finger push-ups, using the thumb and the index finger of one hand, with feet at approximately shoulder-width apart.

In the same Long Beach event, he also performed the &quot;one-inch punch&quot;. Lee stood upright, his right foot forward with knees bent slightly, in front of a standing, stationary partner. Lee&#x27;s right arm was partly extended and his right fist was approximately away from the partner&#x27;s chest. Without retracting his right arm, Lee then forcibly delivered the punch to volunteer Bob Baker while largely maintaining his posture. This sent Baker backward and falling into a chair placed behind Baker to prevent injury, though Baker&#x27;s momentum caused him to fall to the floor. Baker recalled, &quot;I told Bruce not to do this type of demonstration again. When he punched me that last time, I had to stay home from work because the pain in my chest was unbearable&quot;. It was at the 1964 championships that Lee first met Taekwondo master Jhoongoo Rhee. The two developed a friendship— a relationship from which they benefited as martial artists. Rhee taught Lee the side kick in detail, and Lee taught Rhee the &quot;non-telegraphic&quot; punch.

At the Long Beach event, he also publicly criticized a number of classical karate and kung fu styles and argued for modernizing martial arts. This was a highly controversial presentation that convinced some spectators, while offending others. Subsequently, he appeared at the Sun Sing Theatre to present his new approach to the Chinatown, Oakland, community. More traditional kung fu practitioners took Lee&#x27;s claims as an open challenge.

In 1964, Lee had a controversial private match with Wong Jack-man Jack Man was a direct student of Ma Kin Fung, known for his mastery of Xingyiquan, Northern Shaolin, and tai chi. According to Lee, the Chinese community issued an ultimatum to him to stop teaching non-Chinese people. When he refused to comply, he was challenged to a combat match with Wong. The arrangement was that if Lee lost, he would have to shut down his school, while if he won, he would be free to teach white people, or anyone else. Wong denied this, stating that he requested to fight Lee after Lee boasted during one of his demonstrations at a Chinatown theater that he could beat anyone in San Francisco, and that Wong himself did not discriminate against whites or other non-Chinese people. Lee commented, &quot;That paper had all the names of the sifu from Chinatown, but they don&#x27;t scare me&quot;. Individuals known to have witnessed the match include Cadwell, James Lee (Bruce Lee&#x27;s associate, no relation), and William Chen, a teacher of tai chi.

Wong and William Chen stated that the fight lasted an unusually long 20–25 minutes. Wong claims that although he had originally expected a serious but polite bout, Lee aggressively attacked him with the intent to kill. When Wong presented the traditional handshake, Lee appeared to accept the greeting, but instead, Lee allegedly thrust his hand as a spear aimed at Wong&#x27;s eyes. Forced to defend his life, Wong asserted that he refrained from striking Lee with killing force when the opportunity presented itself because it could have earned him a prison sentence, but used illegal cufflings under his sleeves. According to Michael Dorgan&#x27;s 1980 book &quot;Bruce Lee&#x27;s Toughest Fight&quot;, the fight ended due to Lee&#x27;s &quot;unusually winded&quot; condition, as opposed to a decisive blow by either fighter.

However, according to Bruce Lee, Linda Lee Cadwell, and James Yimm Lee, the fight lasted a mere three minutes with a decisive victory for Lee. In Cadwell&#x27;s account, &quot;The fight ensued, it was a no-holds-barred fight, it took three minutes. Bruce got this guy down to the ground and said &#x27;Do you give up?&#x27; and the man said he gave up&quot;. A couple of weeks after the bout, Lee gave an interview claiming that he had defeated an unnamed challenger, which Wong says was an obvious reference to him.

In response, Wong published his account of the fight in the &quot;Pacific Weekly&quot;, a Chinese-language newspaper in San Francisco, with an invitation to a public rematch if Lee was not satisfied with the account. Lee did not respond to the invitation despite his reputation for violently responding to every provocation. There were no further public announcements by either, though Lee continued to teach non-Chinese people. Lee was unhappy with the outcome of the fight, and the experience led him to pursue further innovations in his personal style of martial arts.

Lee had abandoned thoughts of a film career in favor of pursuing martial arts. However, a martial arts exhibition in Long Beach in 1964 eventually led to the invitation by television producer William Dozier for an audition for a role in the pilot for &quot;Number One Son&quot; about Lee Chan, the son of Charlie Chan. The show never materialized, but Dozier saw potential in Lee.

=== 1966–1970: American roles and creating Jeet Kune Do ===

From 1966 to 1967, Lee played the role of Kato alongside the title character played by Van Williams in the TV series produced and narrated by William Dozier titled &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;, based on the radio show by the same name. The show ran for one season (26 episodes) from September 1966 to March 1967. Lee and Williams also appeared as their characters in three crossover episodes of &quot;Batman&quot;, another William Dozier-produced television series.

The Green Hornet introduced the adult Bruce Lee to an American audience and became the first popular American show presenting Asian-style martial arts. The show&#x27;s director wanted Lee to fight in the typical American style using fists and punches. As a professional martial artist, Lee refused, insisting that he should fight in the style of his expertise. At first, Lee moved so fast that his movements could not be caught on film, so he had to slow them down. The American martial arts community promoted the TV show and viewed Lee as their first mainstream star.

During the show&#x27;s production, Lee became friends with Gene LeBell, who worked as a stuntman in the show. The two trained together and exchanged martial arts knowledge from their respective specialties. After the show was canceled in 1967, Lee wrote to Dozier thanking him for starting &quot;my career in show business&quot;.
After filming one season of &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;, Lee found himself out of work and opened the Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute in Chinatown, Los Angeles. The controversial match with Wong Jack-man influenced Lee&#x27;s philosophy about martial arts. Lee concluded that the fight had lasted too long and that he had failed to live up to his potential using his Wing Chun techniques. He took the view that traditional martial arts techniques were too rigid and formalized to be practical in scenarios of chaotic street fighting. Lee decided to develop a system with an emphasis on &quot;practicality, flexibility, speed, and efficiency&quot;. He started to use different methods of training such as weight training for strength, running for endurance, stretching for flexibility, and many others which he constantly adapted, including fencing and basic boxing techniques.

Jeet Kune Do originated in 1967. The name means &quot;way of the intercepting fist&quot; in Cantonese. This was a new hybrid system that took footwork from boxing, kicks from kung fu, and technique from fencing. Lee emphasized what he called &quot;the style of no style&quot;. This consisted of getting rid of the formalized approach which Lee claimed was indicative of traditional styles. Lee felt that even the system he now called Jun Fan Gung Fu was too restrictive, and it eventually evolved into a philosophy and martial art he would come to call &quot;Jeet Kune Do&quot; or the &quot;Way of the Intercepting Fist.&quot; It is a term he would later regret, because Jeet Kune Do implied specific parameters that styles connote, whereas the idea of his martial art was to exist outside of parameters and limitations.

At the time, two of Lee&#x27;s martial arts students were Hollywood script writer Stirling Silliphant and actor James Coburn. In 1969, the three worked on a script for a film titled &quot;The Silent Flute&quot;, and they went together on a location hunt to India. The project was not realized at the time, but the 1978 film &quot;Circle of Iron&quot;, starring David Carradine, was based on the same plot. In 2010, producer Paul Maslansky was reported to have planned and received funding for a film based on the original script for &quot;The Silent Flute&quot;.

In 1969, Lee made a brief appearance in the Silliphant-penned film &quot;Marlowe&quot;, where he played a hoodlum hired to intimidate private detective Philip Marlowe, played by James Garner, who uses his martial arts abilities to commit acts of vandalization to intimidate Marlowe. The same year, he was credited as the karate advisor in &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot;, the fourth installment of the Matt Helm comedy spy-fi film starring Dean Martin. Also that year, Lee acted in one episode of &quot;Here Come the Brides&quot; and &quot;Blondie&quot;.

In 1970, Lee was responsible for producing the fight choreography of &quot;A Walk in the Spring Rain&quot;, starring Ingrid Bergman and Anthony Quinn, again written by Silliphant.

=== 1971–1973: Hong Kong films and Hollywood breakthrough ===

In 1971, Lee appeared in four episodes of the television series &quot;Longstreet&quot;, written by Silliphant. Lee played Li Tsung, the martial arts instructor of the title character Mike Longstreet, played by James Franciscus, and important aspects of his martial arts philosophy were written into the script. According to statements made by Lee, and also by Linda Lee Cadwell after Lee&#x27;s death, Lee pitched a television series of his own in 1971, tentatively titled &quot;The Warrior&quot;, discussions of which were confirmed by Warner Bros. During a December 9, 1971, television interview on &quot;The Pierre Berton Show&quot;, Lee stated that both Paramount and Warner Bros. wanted him &quot;to be in a modernized type of a thing and that they think the Western idea is out, whereas I want to do the Western&quot;.

According to Cadwell, Lee&#x27;s concept was retooled and renamed &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, but Warner Bros. gave Lee no credit. Warner Bros. states that they had for some time been developing an identical concept, created by two writers and producers, Ed Spielman and Howard Friedlander in 1969, as stated too by Lee&#x27;s biographer Matthew Polly. According to these sources, the reason Lee was not cast was because he had a thick accent, but Fred Weintraub attributes that to his ethnicity.

The role of the Shaolin monk in the Kung Fu was eventually awarded to then-non-martial artist David Carradine. In an interview with &quot;The Pierre Berton Show&quot;, Lee stated he understood Warner Bros.&#x27; attitudes towards casting in the series: &quot;They think that business-wise it is a risk. I don&#x27;t blame them. If the situation were reversed, and an American star were to come to Hong Kong, and I was the man with the money, I would have my own concerns as to whether the acceptance would be there&quot;.

Producer Fred Weintraub had advised Lee to return to Hong Kong and make a feature film that he could showcase to executives in Hollywood. Not happy with his supporting roles in the US, Lee returned to Hong Kong. Unaware that &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; had been played to success in Hong Kong and was unofficially referred to as &quot;The Kato Show&quot;, he was surprised to be recognized as the star of the show. After negotiating with both Shaw Brothers Studio and Golden Harvest, Lee signed a film contract to star in two films produced by Golden Harvest.

Lee played his first leading role in &quot;The Big Boss&quot; (1971), which proved to be an enormous box-office success across Asia and catapulted him to stardom. He followed up with &quot;Fist of Fury&quot; (1972), which broke the box office records set previously by &quot;The Big Boss&quot;. Having finished his initial two-year contract, Lee negotiated a new deal with Golden Harvest. Lee later formed his own company, Concord Production Inc., with Chow. For his third film, &quot;The Way of the Dragon&quot; (1972), he was given complete control of the film&#x27;s production as the writer, director, star, and choreographer of the fight scenes. In 1964, at a demonstration in Long Beach, California, Lee met karate champion Chuck Norris. In &quot;The Way of the Dragon&quot; Lee introduced Norris to moviegoers as his opponent. Their showdown has been characterized as &quot;one of the best fight scenes in martial arts and film history&quot;. The role had originally been offered to American karate champion Joe Lewis. &quot;Fist of Fury&quot; and &quot;Way of the Dragon&quot; grossed an estimated and worldwide, respectively.

From August to October 1972, Lee began work on his fourth Golden Harvest film, &quot;Game of Death&quot;. He began filming some scenes, including his fight sequence with American basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, a former student. Production stopped in November 1972 when Warner Bros. offered Lee the opportunity to star in &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;, the first film to be produced jointly by Concord, Golden Harvest, and Warner Bros. Filming began in Hong Kong in February 1973 and was completed in April 1973.

One month into the filming, another production company, Starseas Motion Pictures, promoted Lee as a leading actor in &quot;Fist of Unicorn&quot;, although he had merely agreed to choreograph the fight sequences in the film as a favor to his long-time friend Unicorn Chan. Lee planned to sue the production company but retained his friendship with Chan. However, only a few months after the completion of &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;, and six days before its July 26, 1973, release, Lee died.

&quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; went on to become one of the year&#x27;s highest-grossing films and cemented Lee as a martial arts legend. It was made for US$850,000 in 1973, the equivalent of $4 million adjusted for inflation as of 2007. &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; is estimated to have grossed over worldwide, the equivalent of over adjusted for inflation . The film sparked a brief fad in martial arts, epitomized in songs such as &quot;Kung Fu Fighting&quot; and some TV shows.

=== 1978–present: Posthumous work ===
 Robert Clouse, the director of &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;, together with Golden Harvest, revived Lee&#x27;s unfinished film &quot;Game of Death&quot;. Lee had shot over 100 minutes of footage, including outtakes, for &quot;Game of Death&quot; before shooting was stopped to allow him to work on &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;. In addition to Abdul-Jabbar, George Lazenby, Hapkido master Ji Han-jae, and another of Lee&#x27;s students, Dan Inosanto, appeared in the film, which culminated in Lee&#x27;s character, Hai Tien, clad in a yellow tracksuit taking on a series of different challengers on each floor as they make their way through a five-level pagoda.

In a controversial move, Robert Clouse finished the film using a Lee look-alike (Kim Tai Chung, with Yuen Biao as a stunt double) and archive footage of Lee from his other films with a new storyline and cast. It was released in 1978. The cobbled-together film contained only fifteen minutes of actual footage of Lee. The unused footage Lee had filmed was recovered 22 years later and included in the documentary &quot;Bruce Lee: A Warrior&#x27;s Journey&quot;.
In 1972, after the success of &quot;The Big Boss&quot; and &quot;Fist of Fury&quot;, a third film was planned by Raymond Chow at Golden Harvest to be directed by Lo Wei, titled &quot;Yellow-Faced Tiger&quot;. However, at the time, Lee decided to direct and produce his script for &quot;Way of the Dragon&quot; instead. Although Lee had formed a production company with Raymond Chow, a period film was also planned from September–November 1973 with the competing Shaw Brothers Studio, to be directed by either Chor Yuen or Cheng Kang, and written by Yi Kang and Chang Cheh, titled &quot;The Seven Sons of the Jade Dragon&quot;.

In 2015, Perfect Storm Entertainment and Bruce Lee&#x27;s daughter, Shannon Lee, announced that the series &quot;The Warrior&quot; would be produced and would air on Cinemax. Filmmaker Justin Lin was chosen to direct the series. Production began in October 2017, in Cape Town, South Africa. The first season has 10 episodes. In April 2019, Cinemax renewed the series for a second season.

In March 2021, it was announced that producer Jason Kothari had acquired the rights to &quot;The Silent Flute&quot; &quot;to become a miniseries, which would have John Fusco as a screenwriter and executive producer.

=== Unproduced works ===
Lee had also worked on several scripts himself. A tape containing a recording of Lee narrating the basic storyline to a film tentatively titled &quot;Southern Fist/Northern Leg&quot; exists, showing some similarities with the canned script for &quot;The Silent Flute&quot; (&quot;Circle of Iron&quot;). Another script had the title &quot;Green Bamboo Warrior&quot;, set in San Francisco, planned to co-star Bolo Yeung and to be produced by Andrew Vajna. Photoshoot costume tests were organized for some of these planned film projects.

== Martial arts and fitness ==


Lee&#x27;s films are known for popularising the side kick, roundhouse kick, grappling, spinning heel kick, armbar, weapons such as the nunchaku, and his distinctive &quot;kiai&quot;. Lee was also known for popularising the one-inch punch and the two-finger push-up. 

=== Striking ===
Lee&#x27;s first introduction to martial arts was through his father, from whom he learned the fundamentals of Wu-style tai chi. In his teens, Lee became involved in Hong Kong gang conflicts, which led to frequent street fights. The largest influence on Lee&#x27;s martial arts development was his study of Wing Chun. Lee was 16 years old under the Wing Chun teacher Ip Man, between late 1956 and 1957, after losing to rival gang members.

Ip&#x27;s regular classes generally consisted of form practice, &quot;chi sao&quot; (sticking hands) drills, wooden dummy techniques, and free sparring. There was no set pattern for the classes. Other Chinese martial arts styles Lee trained in were Northern Praying Mantis, Southern Praying Mantis, Eagle Claw, Tan Tui, Law Hon, Mizongyi, Wa K&#x27;ung, Monkey, Southern Dragon, Fujian White Crane, Choy Li Fut, Hung Gar, Choy Gar, Fut Gar, Mok Gar, Yau Kung Moon, Li Gar, and Lau Gar.

Lee was trained in boxing, between 1956 and 1958, by Brother Edward, coach of the St. Francis Xavier&#x27;s College boxing team. Lee went on to win the Hong Kong Schools boxing tournament in 1958 while scoring knockdowns against the previous champion Gary Elms in the final. After moving to the United States, Lee was heavily influenced by heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali, whose footwork he studied and incorporated into his style in the 1960s.

Lee demonstrated his Jeet Kune Do martial arts at the Long Beach International Karate Championships in 1964 and 1968, with the latter having higher-quality video footage available. Lee is seen demonstrating quick eye strikes before his opponent can block and demonstrating the one-inch punch on several volunteers. He demonstrates &quot;chi sao&quot; drills while blindfolded against an opponent, probing for weaknesses in his opponent while scoring with punches and takedowns. Lee then participates in a full-contact sparring bout against an opponent, with both wearing leather headgear.

Lee is seen implementing his Jeet Kune Do concept of economical motion, using Ali-inspired footwork to keep out of range while counter-attacking with backfists and straight punches. He halts attacks with stop-hit side kicks and quickly executes several sweeps and head kicks. The opponent repeatedly attempts to attack Lee but is never able to connect with a clean hit. He once managed to come close with a spin kick, but Lee counters it. The footage was reviewed by &quot;Black Belt&quot; magazine in 1995, concluding that &quot;the action is as fast and furious as anything in Lee&#x27;s films.&quot;

It was at the 1964 championships that Lee first met taekwondo master Jhoongoo Rhee. While Rhee taught Lee the side kick in detail, Lee taught Rhee the &quot;non-telegraphic&quot; punch. Rhee learned what he calls the &quot;accupunch&quot; from Lee and incorporated it into American taekwondo. The &quot;accupunch&quot; is a rapid fast punch that is very difficult to block, based on human reaction time—&quot;the idea is to finish the execution of the punch before the opponent can complete the brain-to-wrist communication.&quot;

Lee commonly used the oblique kick, made popular much later in mixed martial arts. It is called the &quot;jeet tek&quot;, &quot;stop kick&quot; or &quot;intercepting kick&quot;, in Jeet Kune Do.

=== Grappling ===
Lee favored cross-training between different fighting styles, and had a particular interest in grappling. Lee trained with several judo practitioners in Seattle and California, among them Fred Sato, Jesse Glover, Taky Kimura, Hayward Nishioka, and Wally Jay, as well as Gene LeBell. Many of his first students were proficient in judo and other arts, and he learned as much as he taught. After befriending LeBell on the set of &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;, Lee offered to teach him striking arts in exchange for being taught grappling techniques. LeBell had been taught catch wrestling by prestigious grapplers Lou Thesz and Ed Lewis, and notable techniques of both judo and catch wrestling can be seen in Lee&#x27;s &quot;Tao of Jeet Kune Do&quot;. He also learned grappling moves from hapkido master Ji Han-jae.

According to Glover, Lee only found judo ineffective at the action of getting hold of the opponent. In their first training together, Glover showed Lee an osoto gari, which Lee considered not a bad technique, but he disliked that Glover had needed to hold onto Lee. While in Seattle, Lee developed anti-grappling techniques against opponents trying to tackle him or take him to the ground. Glover recalled Lee &quot;definitely would not go to the ground if he had the opportunity to get you standing up.&quot; Nonetheless, Lee expressed to LeBell a wish to integrate judo into his fighting style. He incorporated the osoto gari into Jeet Kune Do, among other throws, armlocks and chokeholds from judo.

Although Lee opined that grappling was of little use in action choreography because it was not visually distinctive, he showcased grappling moves in his films, such as &quot;Way of the Dragon&quot;, where his character finishes his opponent Chuck Norris with a neck hold inspired by LeBell, and &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;, whose prolog features Lee submitting his opponent Sammo Hung with an armbar. &quot;Game of Death&quot; also features Lee and Han-jae exchanging grappling moves, as well as Lee using wrestling against the character played by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

Lee was also influenced by the training routine of The Great Gama, an Indian/Pakistani pehlwani wrestling champion known for his grappling strength. Lee incorporated Gama&#x27;s exercises into his training routine.

=== Street fighting ===
Another major influence on Lee was Hong Kong&#x27;s street fighting culture in the form of rooftop fights. In the mid-20th century, soaring crime in Hong Kong, combined with limited Hong Kong Police manpower, led to many young Hongkongers learning martial arts for self-defense. Around the 1960s, there were about 400 martial arts schools in Hong Kong, teaching their distinctive styles of martial arts. In Hong Kong&#x27;s street fighting culture, there emerged a rooftop fight scene in the 1950s and 1960s, where gangs from rival martial arts schools challenged each other to bare-knuckle fights on Hong Kong&#x27;s rooftops, to avoid crackdowns by British colonial authorities. Lee frequently participated in these Hong Kong rooftop fights. He combined different techniques from different martial arts schools into his own hybrid martial arts style.

When Lee returned to Hong Kong in the early 1970s, his reputation as &quot;the fastest fist in the east&quot; routinely led to locals challenging him to street fights. He sometimes accepted these challenges and engaged in street fights, which led to some criticism from the press portraying him as violent at the time.

=== Fitness ===
At and weighing , Lee was renowned for his physical fitness and vigor, achieved by using a dedicated fitness regimen to become as strong as possible. After his match with Wong Jack-man in 1965, Lee changed his approach toward martial arts training. Lee felt that many martial artists of his time did not spend enough time on physical conditioning. Lee included all elements of total fitness—muscular strength, muscular endurance, cardiovascular endurance, and flexibility. He used traditional bodybuilding techniques to build some muscle mass, though not overdone, as that could decrease speed or flexibility. At the same time, concerning balance, Lee maintained that mental and spiritual preparation are fundamental to the success of physical training in martial arts skills. In &quot;Tao of Jeet Kune Do&quot; he wrote:

According to Linda Lee Cadwell, soon after he moved to the United States, Lee started to take nutrition seriously and developed an interest in health foods, high-protein drinks, and vitamin and mineral supplements. He later concluded that achieving a high-performance body was akin to maintaining the engine of a high-performance automobile. Allegorically, as one could not keep a car running on low-octane fuels, one could not sustain one&#x27;s body with a steady diet of junk food, and with &quot;the wrong fuel&quot;, one&#x27;s body would perform sluggishly or sloppily.

Lee avoided baked goods and refined flour, describing them as providing empty calories that did nothing for his body. He was known for being a fan of Asian cuisine for its variety and often ate meals with a combination of vegetables, rice, and fish. Lee had a dislike for dairy products and as a result, used powdered milk in his diet.

Dan Inosanto recalls Lee practiced meditation as the first action on his schedule.

== Artistry ==
=== Philosophy ===
While best known as a martial artist, Lee studied drama and Asian and Western philosophy, starting while a student at the University of Washington. He was well-read and had an extensive library dominated by martial arts subjects and philosophical texts. His books on martial arts and fighting philosophy are known for their philosophical assertions, both inside and outside of martial arts circles. His eclectic philosophy often mirrored his fighting beliefs, though he was quick to say that his martial arts were solely a metaphor for such teachings.

He believed that any knowledge ultimately led to self-knowledge. He said that his chosen method of self-expression was martial arts. His influences include Taoism and Buddhism. Lee&#x27;s philosophy was very much in opposition to the conservative worldview advocated by Confucianism. John Little states that Lee was an atheist. When asked in 1972 about his religious affiliation, he replied, &quot;None whatsoever&quot;. When asked if he believed in God, he said, &quot;To be perfectly frank, I really do not.&quot;

In his notebooks, Lee cited and commented on passages from Plato, David Hume, René Descartes, and Thomas Aquinas, from Western philosophy, and Lao-tzu, Chuang-tzu, Miyamoto Musashi, and Alan Watts from Eastern thought. He was particularly interested in the Indian mystic Jiddu Krishnamurti.

=== Poetry ===
Aside from martial arts and philosophy, which focus on the physical aspect and self-consciousness for truths and principles, Lee also wrote poetry that reflected his emotions and a stage in his life collectively. Many forms of art remain concordant with the artist creating them. Lee&#x27;s principle of self-expression was applied to his poetry as well. His daughter Shannon Lee said, &quot;He did write poetry; he was really the consummate artist.&quot;

His poetic works were originally handwritten on paper, then later on edited and published, with John Little being the major author (editor), for Bruce Lee&#x27;s works. Linda Lee Cadwell (Bruce Lee&#x27;s wife) shared her husband&#x27;s notes, poems, and experiences with followers. She mentioned, &quot;Lee&#x27;s poems are, by American standards, rather dark—reflecting the deeper, less exposed recesses of the human psyche&quot;.

Most of Bruce Lee&#x27;s poems are categorized as anti-poetry or fall into a paradox. The mood in his poems shows the side of the man that can be compared with other poets such as Robert Frost, one of many well-known poets expressing himself with dark poetic works. The paradox taken from the Yin and Yang symbol in martial arts was also integrated into his poetry. His martial arts and philosophy contribute a great part to his poetry. The free verse form of Lee&#x27;s poetry reflects his quote &quot;Be formless ... shapeless, like water.&quot;

== Personal life ==

=== Names ===
Lee&#x27;s Cantonese birth name was &quot;Lee Jun-fan&quot; (). The name homophonically means &quot;return again&quot;, and was given to Lee by his mother, who felt he would return to the United States once he came of age. Because of his mother&#x27;s superstitious nature, she had originally named him &quot;Sai-fon&quot; (), which is a feminine name meaning &quot;small phoenix&quot;. The English name &quot;Bruce&quot; is thought to have been given by the hospital&#x27;s attending physician, Dr. Mary Glover.

Lee had three other Chinese names: Lee Yuen-cham (), a family/clan name; Lee Yuen-kam (), which he used as a student name while he was attending La Salle College, and his Chinese screen name Lee Siu-lung (; &quot;Siu-lung&quot; means &quot;little dragon&quot;). Lee&#x27;s given name Jun-fan was originally written in Chinese as ; however, the &quot;Jun&quot; () Chinese character was identical to part of his grandfather&#x27;s name, Lee Jun-biu (). Hence, the Chinese character for &quot;Jun&quot; in Lee&#x27;s name was changed to the homonym instead, to avoid naming taboo in Chinese tradition.

=== Family ===
Lee&#x27;s father, Lee Hoi-chuen, was one of the leading Cantonese opera and film actors at the time and was embarking on a year-long opera tour with his family on the eve of the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong. Lee Hoi-chuen had been touring the United States for many years and performing in numerous Chinese communities there.

Although many of his peers decided to stay in the US, Lee Hoi-chuen returned to Hong Kong after Bruce&#x27;s birth. Within months, Hong Kong was invaded and the Lees lived for three years and eight months under Japanese occupation. After the war ended, Lee Hoi-chuen resumed his acting career and became a more popular actor during Hong Kong&#x27;s rebuilding years.

Lee&#x27;s mother, Grace Ho, was from one of the wealthiest and most powerful clans in Hong Kong, the Ho-tungs. She was the half-niece of Sir Robert Ho-tung, the Eurasian patriarch of the clan. As such, the young Bruce Lee grew up in an affluent and privileged environment. Despite the advantage of his family&#x27;s status, the neighborhood in which Lee grew up became overcrowded, dangerous, and full of gang rivalries due to an influx of refugees fleeing communist China for Hong Kong, at that time a British Crown Colony.

Grace Ho is reported as either the adopted or biological daughter of Ho Kom-tong (Ho Gumtong, ) and the half-niece of Sir Robert Ho-tung, both notable Hong Kong businessmen and philanthropists. Bruce was the fourth of five children: Phoebe Lee (), Agnes Lee (), Peter Lee, and Robert Lee.
Grace&#x27;s parentage remains unclear. Linda Lee, in her 1989 biography &quot;The Bruce Lee Story&quot;, suggests that Grace had a German father and was a Catholic. Bruce Thomas, in his 1994 biography &quot;Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit&quot;, suggests that Grace had a Chinese mother and a German father. Lee&#x27;s relative Eric Peter Ho, in his 2010 book &quot;Tracing My Children&#x27;s Lineage&quot;, suggests that Grace was born in Shanghai to a Eurasian woman named Cheung King-sin. Eric Peter Ho said that Grace Lee was the daughter of a mixed-race Shanghainese woman and her father was Ho Kom Tong. Grace Lee herself reported that her mother was English and her father was Chinese. Fredda Dudley Balling said Grace Lee was three-quarters Chinese and one-quarter British.

In the 2018 biography &quot;Bruce Lee: A Life&quot;, Matthew Polly identifies Lee&#x27;s maternal grandfather as Ho Kom-tong, who had often been reported as his adoptive grandfather. Ho Kom-tong&#x27;s father, Charles Maurice Bosman, was a Dutch Jewish businessman from Rotterdam. He moved to Hong Kong with the Dutch East India Company and served as the Dutch consul to Hong Kong at one time. He had a Chinese concubine named Sze Tai with whom he had six children, including Ho Kom Tong. Bosman subsequently abandoned his family and immigrated to California. Ho Kom Tong became a wealthy businessman with a wife, 13 concubines, and a British mistress who gave birth to Grace Ho.

His younger brother Robert Lee Jun-fai is a musician and singer; he performed in the Hong Kong group The Thunderbirds. A few singles were sung mostly or all in English. Also released was Lee singing a duet with Irene Ryder. Lee Jun-fai lived with Lee in Los Angeles in the United States and stayed. After Lee&#x27;s death, Lee Jun-fai released an album and a single by the same name dedicated to Lee called &quot;The Ballad of Bruce Lee&quot;.

While studying at the University of Washington he met his future wife Linda Emery, a fellow student studying to become a teacher. As relations between people of different races were still banned in many US states, they married in secret in August 1964. Lee had two children with Linda: Brandon (1965–1993) and Shannon Lee (born 1969). Upon&#x27;s Lee passing in 1973, she continued to promote Bruce Lee&#x27;s martial art Jeet Kune Do. She wrote the 1975 book &quot;Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew&quot;, on which the 1993 feature film &quot;&quot; was based. In 1989, she wrote the book &quot;The Bruce Lee Story.&quot; She retired in 2001 from the family estate.

Lee died when his son Brandon was eight years old. While alive, Lee taught Brandon martial arts and would invite him to visit sets. This gave Brandon the desire to act and he went on to study the craft. As a young adult, Brandon Lee found some success acting in action-oriented pictures such as &quot;Legacy of Rage&quot; (1986), &quot;Showdown in Little Tokyo&quot; (1991), and &quot;Rapid Fire&quot; (1992). In 1993, at the age of 28, Brandon Lee died after being accidentally shot by a prop gun on the set of &quot;The Crow&quot;.

Lee died when his daughter Shannon was four. In her youth she studied Jeet Kune Do under Richard Bustillo, one of her father&#x27;s students; however, her serious studies did not begin until the late 1990s. To train for parts in action movies, she studied Jeet Kune Do with Ted Wong.

=== Friends, students, and contemporaries ===
Lee&#x27;s brother Robert with his friends Taky Kimura, Dan Inosanto, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, and Peter Chin were his pallbearers. Coburn was a martial arts student and a friend of Lee. Coburn worked with Lee and Stirling Silliphant on developing &quot;The Silent Flute.&quot; Upon Lee&#x27;s early death, at his funeral, Coburn gave a eulogy. Regarding McQueen, Lee made no secret that he wanted everything McQueen had and would stop at nothing to get it. Inosanto and Kimura were friends and disciples of Lee. Inosanto who would go on to train Lee&#x27;s son Brandon. Kimura continued to teach Lee&#x27;s craft in Seattle. According to Lee&#x27;s wife, Chin was a lifelong family friend and a student of Lee.

James Yimm Lee (no relation) was one of Lee&#x27;s three personally certified 3rd rank instructors and co-founded the Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute in Oakland where he taught Jun Fan Gung Fu in Lee&#x27;s absence. James was responsible for introducing Lee to Ed Parker, the organizer of the Long Beach International Karate Championships, where Lee was first introduced to the martial arts community. Hollywood couple Roman Polański and Sharon Tate studied martial arts with Lee. Polański flew Lee to Switzerland to train him. Tate studied with Lee in preparation for her role in &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot;. After Tate was murdered by the Manson Family, Polański initially suspected Lee.

Screenwriter Stirling Silliphant was a martial arts student and a friend of Lee. Silliphant worked with Lee and James Coburn on developing &quot;The Silent Flute.&quot; Lee acted and provided his martial arts expertise in several projects penned by Silliphant, the first in &quot;Marlowe&quot; (1969) where Lee plays Winslow Wong a hoodlum well-versed in martial arts. Lee also did fight choreographies for the film &quot;A Walk in the Spring Rain&quot; (1970) and played Li Tsung, a Jeet Kune Do instructor who teaches the main character in the television show &quot;Longstreet&quot; (1971). Elements of his martial arts philosophy were included in the script for the latter.

Basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar studied martial arts and developed a friendship with Lee.

Actor and karate champion Chuck Norris was a friend and training partner of Lee&#x27;s. After Lee&#x27;s death, Norris said he kept in touch with Lee&#x27;s family.

Judoka and professional wrestler Gene LeBell became a friend of Lee on the set of &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;. They trained together and exchanged their knowledge of martial arts.

=== Drug use ===
In July 2021 a private collection of over 40 handwritten letters Lee made to fellow &quot;Fist of Fury&quot; actor Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Baker was sold for $462,500 at Heritage Auctions. These letters were written from 1967 to 1973 and included requests by Lee for Baker to mail him cocaine, pain killers, psilocybin and other drugs for his personal use.

== Death ==

On May 10, 1973, Lee collapsed during an automated dialogue replacement session for &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; at Orange Sky Golden Harvest Film Studio in Hong Kong. Because he was having epileptic seizures and headaches, he was rushed to Hong Kong Baptist Hospital, where doctors diagnosed cerebral edema. They were able to reduce the swelling through the administration of mannitol.

On July 20, 1973, Lee was in Hong Kong to have dinner with actor George Lazenby, with whom he intended to make a film. According to Lee&#x27;s wife Linda, Lee met producer Raymond Chow at 2 p.m. at home to discuss the making of the film &quot;Game of Death&quot;. They worked until 4 p.m. and then drove together to the home of Lee&#x27;s colleague Betty Ting Pei, a Taiwanese actress. The three went over the script at Ting&#x27;s home, and then Chow left to attend a dinner meeting.

Lee took a nap and, when he did not arrive at the dinner, Chow came to the apartment, but he was unable to wake Lee up. A doctor was summoned and spent ten minutes attempting to revive Lee before sending him by ambulance to Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Lee was declared dead on arrival at the age of 32.

Lee was buried in Lake View Cemetery in Seattle. Pallbearers at Lee&#x27;s funeral on July 25, 1973, included Taky Kimura, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Dan Inosanto, Peter Chin, and Lee&#x27;s brother Robert.

=== Possible causes of death ===
Lee&#x27;s iconic status and untimely death fed many rumors and theories. These included murder involving the triads and a supposed curse on him and his family.

Donald Teare, a forensic scientist recommended by Scotland Yard who had overseen over 1,000 autopsies, was assigned to perform an autopsy on Lee. His conclusion was &quot;death by misadventure&quot; caused by cerebral edema due to a reaction to compounds present in the combination medication Equagesic. According to autopsy reports, Lee&#x27;s brain had swollen from 1,400 to 1,575 grams, a 12.5% increase. Lee had taken Equagesic on the day of his death, which contained both aspirin and the tranquilizer meprobamate, although he had taken it many times before.

Although there was initial speculation that cannabis found in Lee&#x27;s stomach may have contributed to his death, Teare said it would &quot;be both &#x27;irresponsible and irrational&#x27; to say that [cannabis] might have triggered either the events of Bruce&#x27;s collapse on May 10 or his death on July 20&quot;. Dr. R. R. Lycette, the clinical pathologist at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, reported at the coroner hearing that the death could not have been caused by cannabis.

In a 2018 biography, author Matthew Polly consulted with medical experts and theorized that the cerebral edema that killed Lee had been caused by over-exertion and heat stroke; heat stroke was not considered at the time because it was then a poorly understood condition. Furthermore, Lee had his underarm sweat glands removed in late 1972, in the apparent belief that underarm sweat was unphotogenic on film. Polly further theorized that this caused Lee&#x27;s body to overheat while practicing in hot temperatures on May 10 and July 20, 1973, resulting in heat stroke that in turn exacerbated the cerebral edema that led to his death.

In an article in the December 2022 issue of &quot;Clinical Kidney Journal&quot;, a team of researchers examined the various theories regarding Lee&#x27;s cause of death, and concluded that his fatal cerebral edema was brought on by hyponatremia, an insufficient concentration of sodium in the blood. The authors noted that several risk factors predisposed Lee to hyponatremia, including excessive water intake, insufficient solute intake, alcohol consumption, and use or overuse of multiple drugs which impair the ability of the kidneys to excrete excess fluids. Lee&#x27;s symptoms before his death were also found to closely match known cases of fatal hyponatremia.

== Legacy and cultural impact ==

Lee is considered by some commentators and martial artists to be the most influential martial artist of all time, and a pop culture icon of the 20th century, who bridged the gap between East and West. &quot;Time&quot; named Lee one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century.

A number of biography books have been written about Lee. A biography had sold more than copies by 1988.

=== Action films ===
Lee was largely responsible for launching the &quot;kung fu craze&quot; of the 1970s. He initially introduced kung fu to the West with American television shows such as &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; and &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, before the &quot;kung fu craze&quot; began with the dominance of Hong Kong martial arts films in 1973. Lee&#x27;s success inspired a wave of Western martial arts films and television shows throughout the 1970s–1990s (launching the careers of Western martial arts stars such as Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal and Chuck Norris), as well as the more general integration of Asian martial arts into Western action films and television shows during the 1980s1990s.

&quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; has been cited as one of the most influential action films of all time. Sascha Matuszak of &quot;Vice&quot; said &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; &quot;is referenced in all manner of media, the plot line and characters continue to influence storytellers today, and the impact was particularly felt in the revolutionizing way the film portrayed African-Americans, Asians and traditional martial arts.&quot; Kuan-Hsing Chen and Beng Huat Chua cited fight scenes in Lee&#x27;s films such as &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; as being influential for the way they pitched &quot;an elemental story of good against evil in such a spectacle-saturated way&quot;.

A number of action filmmakers around the world have cited Bruce Lee as a formative influence on their careers, including Hong Kong action film directors such as Jackie Chan and John Woo, and Hollywood filmmakers such as Quentin Tarantino and Brett Ratner.

=== Martial arts and combat sports ===
Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial arts philosophy drawing from different combat disciplines that was founded by Lee, is sometimes credited with paving the way for the combat sport mixed martial arts (MMA). The concept of mixed martial arts was popularized in the West by Bruce Lee via his system of Jeet Kune Do. Lee believed that &quot;the best fighter is not a Boxer, Karate or Judo man. The best fighter is someone who can adapt to any style, to be formless, to adopt an individual&#x27;s own style and not following the system of styles.&quot;

In 2004, Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) founder Dana White called Lee the &quot;father of mixed martial arts&quot; and stated: &quot;If you look at the way Bruce Lee trained, the way he fought, and many of the things he wrote, he said the perfect style was no style. You take a little something from everything. You take the good things from every different discipline, use what works, and you throw the rest away&quot;.

Lee was largely responsible for many people taking up martial arts. These include numerous fighters in combat sports who were inspired by Lee; boxing champion Sugar Ray Leonard said he perfected his jab by watching Lee, boxing champion Manny Pacquiao compared his fighting style to Lee, and UFC champion Conor McGregor has compared himself to Lee and said that he believes Lee would have been a champion in the UFC if he were to compete in the present day.

Lee inspired the foundation of American full-contact kickboxing tournaments by Joe Lewis and Benny Urquidez in the 1970s. American taekwondo pioneer Jhoon Goo Rhee learned from Lee what he calls the &quot;accupunch&quot;, which he incorporated into American taekwondo. Rhee later coached heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali and taught him the &quot;accupunch&quot;, which Ali used to knockout Richard Dunn in 1975. According to heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson, &quot;everyone wanted to be Bruce Lee&quot; in the 1970s.

Current UFC Heavyweight Champion Jon Jones cited Lee as inspiration, with Jones known for frequently using the oblique kick to the knee, a technique that was popularized by Lee. Former UFC Middleweight Champion Anderson Silva has also cited Lee as an inspiration. Numerous other UFC fighters have cited Lee as their inspiration, with several referring to him as a &quot;godfather&quot; or &quot;grandfather&quot; of MMA.

=== Racial barriers and stereotypes ===
Lee is credited with helping to change the way Asians were presented in American films. He defied Asian stereotypes, such as the emasculated Asian male stereotype. His friend Amy Sanbo recalls that, &quot;In a time when so many Asians were trying to convince themselves they were white, Bruce was so proud to be Chinese he was busting with it. In contrast to earlier stereotypes which depicted Asian men as emasculated, childlike, coolies, or domestic servants, Lee demonstrated that Asian men could be &quot;tough, strong and sexy&quot; according to University of Michigan lecturer Hye Seung Chung. In turn, Lee&#x27;s popularity inspired a new Asian stereotype, the martial artist.

In North America, his films initially played largely to black, Asian and Hispanic audiences. Within black communities, Lee&#x27;s popularity was second only to heavyweight boxer Muhammad Ali in the 1970s. As Lee broke through to the mainstream, he became a rare non-white movie star in a Hollywood industry dominated by white actors at the time. According to rapper LL Cool J, Lee&#x27;s films were the first time many non-white American children such as himself had seen a non-white action hero on the big screen in the 1970s.

=== Popular culture ===
Numerous entertainment and sports figures around the world have cited Lee as a major influence on their work, including martial arts actors such as Jackie Chan and Donnie Yen, actor-bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger, actor-comedians such as Eddie Murphy and Eddie Griffin, actresses such as Olivia Munn and Dianne Doan, musicians such as Steve Aoki and Rohan Marley, rappers such as LL Cool J and Wu-Tang Clan leader RZA, bands such as Gorillaz, comedians such as W. Kamau Bell and Margaret Cho, basketball players Stephen Curry and Jamal Murray, skaters Tony Hawk and Christian Hosoi, and American footballer Kyler Murray, among others.

Bruce Lee influenced several comic book writers, notably Marvel Comics founder Stan Lee, who considered Bruce Lee to be a superhero without a costume. Shortly after his death, Lee inspired the Marvel characters Shang-Chi (debuted 1973) and Iron Fist (debuted 1974) as well as the comic book series &quot;The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu&quot; (debuted 1974). According to Stan Lee, any character that has been a martial artist since then owes their origin to Bruce Lee in some form.

Bruce Lee was a formative influence on the development of breakdancing in the 1970s. Early breakdancing pioneers such as the Rock Steady Crew drew inspiration from kung fu moves, as performed by Lee, inspiring dance moves such as the windmill among other breaking moves.

In India, Lee films had an influence on Hindi masala films. After the success of Lee films such as &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; in India, &quot;Deewaar&quot; (1975) and later Hindi films incorporated fight scenes inspired by 1970s Hong Kong martial arts films up until the 1990s. According to Indian film star Aamir Khan, when he was a child, &quot;almost every house had a poster of Bruce Lee&quot; in 1970s Bombay.

In Japan, the manga and anime franchises &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; (1983–1988) and &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; (1984–1995) were inspired by Lee films such as &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;. In turn, &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; and especially &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; are credited with setting the trends for popular shōnen manga and anime from the 1980s onwards. Spike Spiegel, the protagonist from the 1998 anime &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, is seen practicing Jeet Kune Do and quotes Lee.

Bruce Lee films such as &quot;Game of Death&quot; and &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; were the foundation for video game genres such as beat &#x27;em up action games and fighting games. The first beat &#x27;em up game, &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; (1984), was based on Lee&#x27;s &quot;Game of Death&quot;. The &quot;Street Fighter&quot; video game franchise (1987 debut) was inspired by &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;, with the gameplay centered around an international fighting tournament, and each character having a unique combination of ethnicity, nationality and fighting style; &quot;Street Fighter&quot; went on to set the template for all fighting games that followed. Since then, nearly every major fighting game franchise has had a character based on Bruce Lee. In April 2014, Lee was named a featured character in the combat sports video game &quot;EA Sports UFC&quot;, and is playable in multiple weight classes.

In France, the Yamakasi cited the martial arts philosophy of Bruce Lee as an influence on their development of the parkour discipline in the 1990s, along with the acrobatics of Jackie Chan. The Yamakasi considered Lee to be the &quot;unofficial president&quot; of their group.

&quot;The Legend of Bruce Lee&quot; (2008), a Chinese television drama series based on the life of Bruce Lee, has been watched by over viewers in China, making it the most-watched Chinese television drama series of all time, as of 2017.

In November 2022, it was announced that Taiwanese filmmaker Ang Lee was directing a biopic on Bruce Lee. Ang Lee&#x27;s son Mason Lee was cast to star in the movie, while Bruce Lee&#x27;s daughter, Shannon Lee, is set to produce the film.

In 2024, there was a proposal made to erect a statue of Bruce Lee in San Francisco. Lee&#x27;s daughter is in favor of erecting it stating, &quot;the Bay Area is a very rich and vital part of our legacy.&quot;

=== Tributes ===
Underworld pay tribute to Bruce Lee in their song Bruce Lee from their 1999 album Beaucoup Fish, a blend of rock, techno, and guitar riffs. According to DAFT FM, the lyrics can be interpreted as encouraging the idea of self-actualization and individuals to be true to themselves, thus paying tribute to Lee&#x27;s philosophy of empowering oneself and living life to the fullest.

=== Commercials ===
Though Bruce Lee did not appear in commercials during his lifetime, his likeness and image has since appeared in hundreds of commercials around the world. Nokia launched an Internet-based campaign in 2008 with staged &quot;documentary-looking&quot; footage of Bruce Lee playing ping-pong with his nunchaku and also igniting matches as they are thrown toward him. The videos went viral on YouTube, creating confusion as some people believed them to be authentic footage.

<text>A cypherpunk is one who advocates the widespread use of strong cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies as a means of effecting social and political change. The cypherpunk movement originated in the late 1980s and gained traction with the establishment of the &quot;Cypherpunks&quot; electronic mailing list in 1992, where informal groups of activists, technologists, and cryptographers discussed strategies to enhance individual privacy and resist state or corporate surveillance. Deeply libertarian in philosophy, the movement is rooted in principles of decentralization, individual autonomy, and freedom from centralized authority. Its influence on society extends to the development of technologies that have reshaped global finance, communication, and privacy practices, such as the creation of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which embody cypherpunk ideals of decentralized and censorship-resistant money. The movement has also contributed to the mainstreaming of encryption in everyday technologies, such as secure messaging apps and privacy-focused web browsers. The cypherpunk ethos has had a lasting impact on debates around digital rights, surveillance, and personal freedoms in the 21st century. The movement has been active since at least 1990 and continues to inspire initiatives aimed at fostering a more private and secure digital world.

== History ==

=== Before the mailing list ===

Until about the 1970s, cryptography was mainly practiced in secret by military or spy agencies. However, that changed when two publications brought it into public awareness: the first publicly available work on public-key cryptography, by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, and the US government publication of the Data Encryption Standard (DES), a block cipher which became very widely used.

The technical roots of Cypherpunk ideas have been traced back to work by cryptographer David Chaum on topics such as anonymous digital cash and pseudonymous reputation systems, described in his paper &quot;Security without Identification: Transaction Systems to Make Big Brother Obsolete&quot; (1985).

In the late 1980s, these ideas coalesced into something like a movement.

=== Etymology and the Cypherpunks mailing list ===

In late 1992, Eric Hughes, Timothy C. May, and John Gilmore founded a small group that met monthly at Gilmore&#x27;s company Cygnus Solutions in the San Francisco Bay Area and was humorously termed &quot;cypherpunks&quot; by Jude Milhon at one of the first meetings—derived from &quot;cipher&quot; and &quot;cyberpunk&quot;. In November 2006, the word was added to the Oxford English Dictionary.

The Cypherpunks mailing list was started in 1992, and by 1994 had 700 subscribers. At its peak, it was a very active forum with technical discussions ranging over mathematics, cryptography, computer science, political and philosophical discussion, personal arguments and attacks, etc., with some spam thrown in. An email from John Gilmore reports an average of 30 messages a day from December 1, 1996, to March 1, 1999, and suggests that the number was probably higher earlier. The number of subscribers is estimated to have reached 2,000 in the year 1997.

In early 1997, Jim Choate and Igor Chudov set up the Cypherpunks Distributed Remailer, a network of independent mailing list nodes intended to eliminate the single point of failure inherent in a centralized list architecture. At its peak, the Cypherpunks Distributed Remailer included at least seven nodes. By mid-2005, al-qaeda.net ran the only remaining node. In mid-2013, following a brief outage, the al-qaeda.net node&#x27;s list software was changed from Majordomo to GNU Mailman, and subsequently the node was renamed to cpunks.org. The CDR architecture is now defunct, though the list administrator stated in 2013 that he was exploring a way to integrate this functionality with the new mailing list software.

For a time, the cypherpunks mailing list was a popular tool with mailbombers, who would subscribe a victim to the mailing list in order to cause a deluge of messages to be sent to him or her. (This was usually done as a prank, in contrast to the style of terrorist referred to as a mailbomber.) This precipitated the mailing list sysop(s) to institute a reply-to-subscribe system. Approximately two hundred messages a day was typical for the mailing list, divided between personal arguments and attacks, political discussion, technical discussion, and early spam.

The cypherpunks mailing list had extensive discussions of the public policy issues related to cryptography and on the politics and philosophy of concepts such as anonymity, pseudonyms, reputation, and privacy. These discussions continue both on the remaining node and elsewhere as the list has become increasingly moribund.

Events such as the GURPS Cyberpunk raid lent weight to the idea that private individuals needed to take steps to protect their privacy. In its heyday, the list discussed public policy issues related to cryptography, as well as more practical nuts-and-bolts mathematical, computational, technological, and cryptographic matters. The list had a range of viewpoints and there was probably no completely unanimous agreement on anything. The general attitude, though, definitely put personal privacy and personal liberty above all other considerations.

==== Early discussion of online privacy ====
The list was discussing questions about privacy, government monitoring, corporate control of information, and related issues in the early 1990s that did not become major topics for broader discussion until at least ten years later. Some list participants were highly radical on these issues.

Those wishing to understand the context of the list might refer to the history of cryptography; in the early 1990s, the US government considered cryptography software a munition for export purposes. (PGP source code was published as a paper book to bypass these regulations and demonstrate their futility.) In 1992, a deal between NSA and SPA allowed export of cryptography based on 40-bit RC2 and RC4 which was considered relatively weak (and especially after SSL was created, there were many contests to break it). The US government had also tried to subvert cryptography through schemes such as Skipjack and key escrow. It was also not widely known that all communications were logged by government agencies (which would later be revealed during the NSA and AT&amp;T scandals) though this was taken as an obvious axiom by list members.

The original cypherpunk mailing list, and the first list spin-off, &quot;coderpunks&quot;, were originally hosted on John Gilmore&#x27;s toad.com, but after a falling out with the sysop over moderation, the list was migrated to several cross-linked mail-servers in what was called the &quot;distributed mailing list.&quot; The &quot;coderpunks&quot; list, open by invitation only, existed for a time. &quot;Coderpunks&quot; took up more technical matters and had less discussion of public policy implications. There are several lists today that can trace their lineage directly to the original Cypherpunks list: the cryptography list (cryptography@metzdowd.com), the financial cryptography list (fc-announce@ifca.ai), and a small group of closed (invitation-only) lists as well.

Toad.com continued to run with the existing subscriber list, those that didn&#x27;t unsubscribe, and was mirrored on the new distributed mailing list, but messages from the distributed list didn&#x27;t appear on toad.com. As the list faded in popularity, so too did it fade in the number of cross-linked subscription nodes.

To some extent, the cryptography list acts as a successor to cypherpunks; it has many of the people and continues some of the same discussions. However, it is a moderated list, considerably less zany and somewhat more technical. A number of current systems in use trace to the mailing list, including Pretty Good Privacy, /dev/random in the Linux kernel (the actual code has been completely reimplemented several times since then) and today&#x27;s anonymous remailers.

== Main principles ==
The basic ideas can be found in &quot;A Cypherpunk&#x27;s Manifesto&quot; (Eric Hughes, 1993): &quot;Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. ... We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant us privacy ... We must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any. ... Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and ... we&#x27;re going to write it.&quot;

Some are or were senior people at major hi-tech companies and others are well-known researchers (see list with affiliations below).

The first mass media discussion of cypherpunks was in a 1993 &quot;Wired&quot; article by Steven Levy titled &quot;Crypto Rebels&quot;:

The three masked men on the cover of that edition of &quot;Wired&quot; were prominent cypherpunks Tim May, Eric Hughes and John Gilmore.

Later, Levy wrote a book, &quot;Crypto: How the Code Rebels Beat the Government – Saving Privacy in the Digital Age&quot;,
covering the crypto wars of the 1990s in detail. &quot;Code Rebels&quot; in the title is almost synonymous with cypherpunks.

The term &quot;cypherpunk&quot; is mildly ambiguous. In most contexts it means anyone advocating cryptography as a tool for social change, social impact and expression. However, it can also be used to mean a participant in the Cypherpunks electronic mailing list described below. The two meanings obviously overlap, but they are by no means synonymous.

Documents exemplifying cypherpunk ideas include Timothy C. May&#x27;s &quot;The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto&quot; (1992) and &quot;The Cyphernomicon&quot; (1994), &quot;A Cypherpunk&#x27;s Manifesto&quot;.

=== Privacy of communications ===

A very basic cypherpunk issue is privacy in communications and data retention. John Gilmore said he wanted &quot;a guarantee -- with physics and mathematics, not with laws -- that we can give ourselves real privacy of personal communications.&quot;

Such guarantees require strong cryptography, so cypherpunks are fundamentally opposed to government policies attempting to control the usage or export of cryptography, which remained an issue throughout the late 1990s. The &quot;Cypherpunk Manifesto&quot; stated &quot;Cypherpunks deplore regulations on cryptography, for encryption is fundamentally a private act.&quot;

This was a central issue for many cypherpunks. Most were passionately opposed to various government attempts to limit cryptography—export laws, promotion of limited key length ciphers, and especially escrowed encryption.

=== Anonymity and pseudonyms ===

The questions of anonymity, pseudonymity and reputation were also extensively discussed.

Arguably, the possibility of anonymous speech, and publication is vital for an open society and genuine freedom of speech—this is the position of most cypherpunks.

=== Censorship and monitoring ===

In general, cypherpunks opposed the censorship and monitoring from government and police.

In particular, the US government&#x27;s Clipper chip scheme for escrowed encryption of telephone conversations (encryption supposedly secure against most attackers, but breakable by government) was seen as anathema by many on the list. This was an issue that provoked strong opposition and brought many new recruits to the cypherpunk ranks. List participant Matt Blaze found a serious flaw in the scheme, helping to hasten its demise.

Steven Schear first suggested the warrant canary in 2002 to thwart the secrecy provisions of court orders and national security letters. , warrant canaries are gaining commercial acceptance.

=== Hiding the act of hiding ===

An important set of discussions concerns the use of cryptography in the presence of oppressive authorities. As a result, Cypherpunks have discussed and improved steganographic methods that hide the use of crypto itself, or that allow interrogators to believe that they have forcibly extracted hidden information from a subject. For instance, &quot;Rubberhose&quot; was a tool that partitioned and intermixed secret data on a drive with fake secret data, each of which accessed via a different password. Interrogators, having extracted a password, are led to believe that they have indeed unlocked the desired secrets, whereas in reality the actual data is still hidden. In other words, even its presence is hidden. Likewise, cypherpunks have also discussed under what conditions encryption may be used without being noticed by network monitoring systems installed by oppressive regimes.

== Activities ==

As the &quot;Manifesto&quot; says, &quot;Cypherpunks write code&quot;; the notion that good ideas need to be implemented, not just discussed, is very much part of the culture of the mailing list. John Gilmore, whose site hosted the original cypherpunks mailing list, wrote: &quot;We are literally in a race between our ability to build and deploy technology, and their ability to build and deploy laws and treaties. Neither side is likely to back down or wise up until it has definitively lost the race.&quot;

=== Software projects ===

Anonymous remailers such as the Mixmaster Remailer were almost entirely a cypherpunk development. Other cypherpunk-related projects include PGP for email privacy, FreeS/WAN for opportunistic encryption of the whole net, Off-the-record messaging for privacy in Internet chat, and the Tor project for anonymous web surfing.

=== Hardware ===
In 1998, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, with assistance from the mailing list, built a $200,000 machine that could brute-force a Data Encryption Standard key in a few days. The project demonstrated that DES was, without question, insecure and obsolete, in sharp contrast to the US government&#x27;s recommendation of the algorithm.

=== Expert panels ===

Cypherpunks also participated, along with other experts, in several reports on cryptographic matters.

One such paper was &quot;Minimal Key Lengths for Symmetric Ciphers to Provide Adequate Commercial Security&quot;. It suggested 75 bits was the &quot;minimum&quot; key size to allow an existing cipher to be considered secure and kept in service. At the time, the Data Encryption Standard with 56-bit keys was still a US government standard, mandatory for some applications.

Other papers were critical analysis of government schemes. &quot;The Risks of Key Recovery, Key Escrow, and Trusted Third-Party Encryption&quot;, evaluated escrowed encryption proposals. &quot;Comments on the Carnivore System Technical Review&quot;. looked at an FBI scheme for monitoring email.

Cypherpunks provided significant input to the 1996 National Research Council report on encryption policy,
&quot;Cryptography&#x27;s Role In Securing the Information Society&quot; (CRISIS). This report, commissioned by the U.S. Congress in 1993, was developed via extensive hearings across the nation from all interested stakeholders, by a committee of talented people. It recommended a gradual relaxation of the existing U.S. government restrictions on encryption. Like many such study reports, its conclusions were largely ignored by policy-makers. Later events such as the final rulings in the cypherpunks lawsuits forced a more complete relaxation of the unconstitutional controls on encryption software.

=== Lawsuits ===

Cypherpunks have filed a number of lawsuits, mostly suits against the US government alleging that some government action is unconstitutional.

Phil Karn sued the State Department in 1994 over cryptography export controls after they ruled that, while the book &quot;Applied Cryptography&quot; could legally be exported, a floppy disk containing a verbatim copy of code printed in the book was legally a munition and required an export permit, which they refused to grant. Karn also appeared before both House and Senate committees looking at cryptography issues.

Daniel J. Bernstein, supported by the EFF, also sued over the export restrictions, arguing that preventing publication of cryptographic source code is an unconstitutional restriction on freedom of speech. He won, effectively overturning the export law. See &quot;Bernstein v. United States&quot; for details.

Peter Junger also sued on similar grounds, and won.

=== Civil disobedience ===

Cypherpunks encouraged civil disobedience, in particular, US law on the export of cryptography. Until 1997, cryptographic code was legally a munition and fell under ITAR, and the key length restrictions in the EAR was not removed until 2000.

In 1995 Adam Back wrote a version of the RSA algorithm for public-key cryptography in three lines of Perl and suggested people use it as an email signature file:

# !/bin/perl -sp0777i&lt;X+d*lMLa^*lN%0]dsXx++lMlN/dsM0&lt;j]dsj
$/=unpack(&#x27;H*&#x27;,$_);$_=`echo 16dio\U$k&quot;SK$/SM$n\EsN0p[lN*1
lK[d2%Sa2/d0$^Ixp&quot;|dc`;s/\W//g;$_=pack(&#x27;H*&#x27;,/((..)*)$/)
Vince Cate put up a web page that invited anyone to become an international arms trafficker; every time someone clicked on the form, an export-restricted item—originally PGP, later a copy of Back&#x27;s program—would be mailed from a US server to one in Anguilla.

=== Cypherpunk fiction ===
In Neal Stephenson&#x27;s novel &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; many characters are on the &quot;Secret Admirers&quot; mailing list. This is fairly obviously based on the cypherpunks list, and several well-known cypherpunks are mentioned in the acknowledgements. Much of the plot revolves around cypherpunk ideas; the leading characters are building a data haven which will allow anonymous financial transactions, and the book is full of cryptography. But, according to the author the book&#x27;s title is—in spite of its similarity—not based on the Cyphernomicon, an online cypherpunk FAQ document.

=== Legacy ===
Cypherpunk achievements would later also be used on the Canadian e-wallet, the MintChip, and the creation of bitcoin. It was an inspiration for CryptoParty decades later to such an extent that &quot;A Cypherpunk&#x27;s Manifesto&quot; is quoted at the header of its Wiki, and Eric Hughes delivered the keynote address at the Amsterdam CryptoParty on 27 August 2012.

<text>Computer-aided design (CAD) is the use of computers (or ) to aid in the creation, modification, analysis, or optimization of a design. This software is used to increase the productivity of the designer, improve the quality of design, improve communications through documentation, and to create a database for manufacturing. Designs made through CAD software help protect products and inventions when used in patent applications. CAD output is often in the form of electronic files for print, machining, or other manufacturing operations. The terms computer-aided drafting (CAD) and computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) are also used.

Its use in designing electronic systems is known as &quot;electronic design automation&quot; (&quot;EDA&quot;). In mechanical design it is known as &quot;mechanical design automation&quot; (&quot;MDA&quot;), which includes the process of creating a technical drawing with the use of computer software.

CAD software for mechanical design uses either vector-based graphics to depict the objects of traditional drafting, or may also produce raster graphics showing the overall appearance of designed objects. However, it involves more than just shapes. As in the manual of technical and engineering drawings, the output of CAD must convey information, such as materials, processes, dimensions, and tolerances, according to application-specific conventions.

CAD may be used to design curves and figures in two-dimensional (2D) space; or curves, surfaces, and solids in three-dimensional (3D) space.

CAD is an important industrial art extensively used in many applications, including automotive, shipbuilding, and aerospace industries, industrial and architectural design (building information modeling), prosthetics, and many more. CAD is also widely used to produce computer animation for special effects in movies, advertising and technical manuals, often called DCC digital content creation. The modern ubiquity and power of computers means that even perfume bottles and shampoo dispensers are designed using techniques unheard of by engineers of the 1960s. Because of its enormous economic importance, CAD has been a major driving force for research in computational geometry, computer graphics (both hardware and software), and discrete differential geometry.

The design of geometric models for object shapes, in particular, is occasionally called computer-aided geometric design (CAGD).

==Overview==
Computer-aided design is one of the many tools used by engineers and designers and is used in many ways depending on the profession of the user and the type of software in question.

CAD is one part of the whole digital product development (DPD) activity within the product lifecycle management (PLM) processes, and as such is used together with other tools, which are either integrated modules or stand-alone products, such as:

* Computer-aided engineering (CAE) and finite element analysis (FEA, FEM)
* Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) including instructions to computer numerical control (CNC) machines
* Photorealistic rendering and motion simulation
* Document management and revision control using product data management (PDM)

CAD is also used for the accurate creation of photo simulations that are often required in the preparation of environmental impact reports, in which computer-aided designs of intended buildings are superimposed into photographs of existing environments to represent what that locale will be like, where the proposed facilities are allowed to be built. Potential blockage of view corridors and shadow studies are also frequently analyzed through the use of CAD.

==Types==

There are several different types of CAD, each requiring the operator to think differently about how to use them and design their virtual components in a different manner. Virtually all of CAD tools rely on constraint concepts that are used to define geometric or non-geometric elements of a model. 

=== 2D CAD ===
There are many producers of the lower-end 2D sketching systems, including a number of free and open-source programs. These provide an approach to the drawing process where scale and placement on the drawing sheet can easily be adjusted in the final draft as required, unlike in hand drafting.

=== 3D CAD ===
&quot;3D wireframe&quot; is an extension of 2D drafting into a three-dimensional space. Each line has to be manually inserted into the drawing. The final product has no mass properties associated with it and cannot have features directly added to it, such as holes. The operator approaches these in a similar fashion to the 2D systems, although many 3D systems allow using the wireframe model to make the final engineering drawing views.

&quot;3D &quot;dumb&quot; solids&quot; are created in a way analogous to manipulations of real-world objects. Basic three-dimensional geometric forms (e.g., prisms, cylinders, spheres, or rectangles) have solid volumes added or subtracted from them as if assembling or cutting real-world objects. Two-dimensional projected views can easily be generated from the models. Basic 3D solids do not usually include tools to easily allow the motion of the components, set their limits to their motion, or identify interference between components.

There are several types of &quot;3D solid modeling&quot;

* &quot;Parametric modeling&quot; allows the operator to use what is referred to as &quot;design intent&quot;. The objects and features are created modifiable. Any future modifications can be made by changing on how the original part was created. If a feature was intended to be located from the center of the part, the operator should locate it from the center of the model. The feature could be located using any geometric object already available in the part, but this random placement would defeat the design intent. If the operator designs the part as it functions, the parametric modeler is able to make changes to the part while maintaining geometric and functional relationships.
* &quot;Direct or explicit modeling&quot; provide the ability to edit geometry without a history tree. With direct modeling, once a sketch is used to create geometry it is incorporated into the new geometry, and the designer only has to modify the geometry afterward without needing the original sketch. As with parametric modeling, direct modeling has the ability to include the relationships between selected geometry (e.g., tangency, concentricity).
* &quot;Assembly modelling&quot; is a process which incorporates results of the previous single-part modelling into a final product containing several parts. Assemblies can be hierarchical, depending on the specific CAD software vendor, and highly complex models can be achieved (e.g. in building engineering by using computer-aided architectural design software)

==== Freeform CAD ====

Top-end CAD systems offer the capability to incorporate more organic, aesthetic and ergonomic features into the designs. Freeform surface modeling is often combined with solids to allow the designer to create products that fit the human form and visual requirements as well as they interface with the machine.

==Technology==

Originally software for CAD systems was developed with computer languages such as Fortran, ALGOL but with the advancement of object-oriented programming methods this has radically changed. Typical modern parametric feature-based modeler and freeform surface systems are built around a number of key C modules with their own APIs. A CAD system can be seen as built up from the interaction of a graphical user interface (GUI) with NURBS geometry or boundary representation (B-rep) data via a geometric modeling kernel. A geometry constraint engine may also be employed to manage the associative relationships between geometry, such as wireframe geometry in a sketch or components in an assembly.

Unexpected capabilities of these associative relationships have led to a new form of prototyping called digital prototyping. In contrast to physical prototypes, which entail manufacturing time in the design. That said, CAD models can be generated by a computer after the physical prototype has been scanned using an industrial CT scanning machine. Depending on the nature of the business, digital or physical prototypes can be initially chosen according to specific needs.

Today, CAD systems exist for all the major platforms (Windows, Linux, UNIX and Mac OS X); some packages support multiple platforms.

Currently, no special hardware is required for most CAD software. However, some CAD systems can do graphically and computationally intensive tasks, so a modern graphics card, high speed (and possibly multiple) CPUs and large amounts of RAM may be recommended.

The human-machine interface is generally via a computer mouse but can also be via a pen and digitizing graphics tablet. Manipulation of the view of the model on the screen is also sometimes done with the use of a Spacemouse/SpaceBall. Some systems also support stereoscopic glasses for viewing the 3D model. Technologies that in the past were limited to larger installations or specialist applications have become available to a wide group of users. These include the CAVE or HMDs and interactive devices like motion-sensing technology

==Software==
Starting with the IBM Drafting System in the mid-1960s, computer-aided design systems began to provide more capabilitties than just an ability to reproduce manual drafting with electronic drafting, and the cost-benefit for companies to switch to CAD became apparent. The software automated many tasks that are taken for granted from computer systems today, such as automated generation of bills of materials, auto layout in integrated circuits, interference checking, and many others. Eventually, CAD provided the designer with the ability to perform engineering calculations. During this transition, calculations were still performed either by hand or by those individuals who could run computer programs. CAD was a revolutionary change in the engineering industry, where draftsman, designer, and engineer roles that had previously been separate began to merge. CAD is an example of the pervasive effect computers were beginning to have on the industry.
Current computer-aided design software packages range from 2D vector-based drafting systems to 3D solid and surface modelers. Modern CAD packages can also frequently allow rotations in three dimensions, allowing viewing of a designed object from any desired angle, even from the inside looking out. Some CAD software is capable of dynamic mathematical modeling.

CAD technology is used in the design of tools and machinery and in the drafting and design of all types of buildings, from small residential types (houses) to the largest commercial and industrial structures (hospitals and factories).

CAD is mainly used for detailed design of 3D models or 2D drawings of physical components, but it is also used throughout the engineering process from conceptual design and layout of products, through strength and dynamic analysis of assemblies to definition of manufacturing methods of components. It can also be used to design objects such as jewelry, furniture, appliances, etc. Furthermore, many CAD applications now offer advanced rendering and animation capabilities so engineers can better visualize their product designs. 4D BIM is a type of virtual construction engineering simulation incorporating time or schedule-related information for project management.

CAD has become an especially important technology within the scope of computer-aided technologies, with benefits such as lower product development costs and a greatly shortened design cycle. CAD enables designers to layout and develop work on screen, print it out and save it for future editing, saving time on their drawings.

=== License management software ===
In the 2000s, some CAD system software vendors shipped their distributions with a dedicated license manager software that controlled how often or how many users can utilize the CAD system. It could run either on a local machine (by loading from a local storage device) or a local network fileserver and was usually tied to a specific IP address in latter case.

==List of software packages==
CAD software enables engineers and architects to design, inspect and manage engineering projects within an integrated graphical user interface (GUI) on a personal computer system. Most applications support solid modeling with boundary representation (B-Rep) and NURBS geometry, and enable the same to be published in a variety of formats.

<text>In academic publishing, a scientific journal is a periodical publication designed to further the progress of science by disseminating new research findings to the scientific community. These journals serve as a platform for researchers, scholars, and scientists to share their latest discoveries, insights, and methodologies across a multitude of scientific disciplines. Unlike professional or trade magazines, the articles are mostly written by scientists rather than staff writers employed by the journal. Scientific journals are characterized by their rigorous peer review process, which aims to ensure the validity, reliability, and quality of the published content. In peer review, submitted articles are reviewed by active scientists (peers) to ensure scientific rigor. With origins dating back to the 17th century, the publication of scientific journals has evolved significantly, playing a pivotal role in the advancement of scientific knowledge, fostering academic discourse, and facilitating collaboration within the scientific community.

, it is estimated that over 28,100 active scientific journals are in publication, covering a broad spectrum of disciplines from the general sciences, as seen in journals like &quot;Science&quot; and &quot;Nature&quot;, to highly specialized fields. These journals primarily publish peer-reviewed articles, including original research, review articles, and perspectives, each serving distinct purposes within the academic landscape. The advent of electronic publishing has further expanded the reach and accessibility of scientific journals, enabling more efficient dissemination and retrieval of information, while also addressing challenges related to cost and copyright.

Scientific journals not only contribute to the dissemination and archival of scientific knowledge but also play a critical role in the academic and research careers of scientists. They are instrumental in keeping researchers informed about the latest developments in their field, supporting the integrity of research through reproducibility and replicability, and influencing the direction of future research endeavors.

==Content==
=== Scientific journals ===
There are thousands of scientific journals in publication, with one estimate from 2012 indicating that there were 28,100 that were active, and many more have been published at various points in the past . Most journals are highly specialized, although some of the oldest journals such as &quot;Science&quot; and &quot;Nature&quot; publish articles and scientific papers across a wide range of scientific fields. Scientific journals contain articles that have been peer reviewed, in an attempt to ensure that articles meet the journal&#x27;s standards of quality and scientific validity. 

Although scientific journals are superficially similar to professional magazines (or trade journals), they are actually quite different. Among other things, scientific journals&#x27; papers&#x27; authors are experts who must cite everything (and have a bibliography). They also deal with research, and are peer reviewed. Meanwhile, trade journals are aimed at people in different fields, focusing on how people in these fields can do their jobs better. They additionally cover information related to work, and include tips and advice for improving performance, but they are not scholarly.

=== Articles in scientific journals ===
Articles in scientific journals are mostly written by active scientists such as students, researchers, and professors. Their intended audience is others in the field (such as students and experts), meaning their content is more advanced and sophisticated than what is found regular publications. They have different purposes, depending on the type. Articles with original research are meant to share it with others in the field, review articles give summaries of research that has already been done, and perspective articles give researchers&#x27; views on research that their peers performed.

Each article has several different sections, including the following: 

* The title;
* Information about the author(s);
* The abstract, which is a one-paragraph summary of the article;
* The introduction, including a background, why the research was done, research on this topic that has been done before, and (possibly) a hypothesis;
* The methodology or method, which includes the way the research was done, details concerning the study&#x27;s sample, measures for assessment, and the procedure;
* Findings or results, which summarize what the study found;
* Conclusion, comments, or discussion, which both explain how the results answered the questions that were posed, as well as areas that could be researched in the future;
* A list of works that the article&#x27;s author cited.

Scientific journal articles are not usually read casually like a person would read a magazine. Whereas magazine articles can be read in a more casual manner, reading an article in a scientific periodical requires a lot more concentration. Reading an article in a scientific journal usually entails first reading the title, to see if it was related to the desired topic. If it was, the next step is to read the abstract (or summary or conclusion, if the abstract is missing), to see if the article is worth reading. Then, if it seems like reading it would be worthwhile, the reader would then read the whole article. 

Publishing research results is an essential part of helping science to advance. If scientists are describing experiments or calculations, they should also explain how they did them so that an independent researcher could repeat the experiment or calculation to verify the results, or so that they could evaluate whatever the research article&#x27;s findings were. Each such journal article also becomes part of the permanent scientific record.

==Scope==

Articles in scientific journals can be used in research and higher education. Scientific articles allow researchers to keep up to date with the developments of their field and direct their own research. An essential part of a scientific article is citation of earlier work. The impact of articles and journals is often assessed by counting citations (citation impact). Some classes are partially devoted to the explication of classic articles, and seminar classes can consist of the presentation by each student of a classic or current paper. Schoolbooks and textbooks have been written usually only on established topics, while the latest research and more obscure topics are only accessible through scientific articles. In a scientific research group or academic department it is usual for the content of current scientific journals to be discussed in journal clubs. Public funding bodies often require the results to be published in scientific journals. Academic credentials for promotion into academic ranks are established in large part by the number and impact of scientific articles published. Many doctoral programs allow for thesis by publication, where the candidate is required to publish a certain number of scientific articles.

==Wording==

Articles tend to be highly technical, representing the latest theoretical research and experimental results in the field of science covered by the journal. They are often incomprehensible to anyone except for researchers in the field and advanced students. In some subjects this is inevitable given the nature of the content. Usually, rigorous rules of scientific writing are enforced by the editors; however, these rules may vary from journal to journal, especially between journals from different publishers. Articles are usually either original articles reporting completely new results or reviews of current literature. There are also scientific publications that bridge the gap between articles and books by publishing thematic volumes of chapters from different authors. Many journals have a regional focus, specializing in publishing papers from a particular geographic region, like &quot;African Invertebrates&quot;.

== History ==
In the 17th century, scientists wrote letters to each other, and included scientific ideas with them. Then, in the mid-17th century, scientists began to hold meetings and share their scientific ideas. Eventually, they led to starting organizations, such as the Royal Society (1660) and the French Academy of Sciences (1666). In 1665, the French &quot;Journal des sçavans&quot; and the English &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot; began systematically publishing research results. Over a thousand, mostly ephemeral, were founded in the 18th century, and the number has increased rapidly since then.

Peer review did not begin until the 1970s, and was seen as a way of enabling researchers who were not as well-known to have their papers published in journals that were more prestigious. Though it was originally done by mailing copies of papers to reviewers, it is now done online.

== Publishing process ==
The authors of scientific articles are active researchers instead of journalists; typically, a graduate student or a researcher writes a paper with a professor. As such, the authors are unpaid and receive no compensation from the journal. However, their funding bodies may require them to publish in scientific journals. The paper is submitted to the journal office, where the editor considers the paper for appropriateness, potential scientific impact and novelty. If the journal&#x27;s editor considers the paper appropriate, the paper is submitted to scholarly peer review. Depending on the field, journal and paper, the paper is sent to 1–3 reviewers for evaluation before they can be granted permission to publish. Reviewers are expected to check the paper for soundness of its scientific argument, including whether the author(s) are sufficiently acquainted with recent relevant research that bears on their study, whether the data was collected or considered appropriately and reproducibly, and whether the data discussed supports the conclusion offered and the implications suggested. Novelty is also key: existing work must be appropriately considered and referenced, and new results improving on the state of the art presented. Reviewers are usually unpaid and not a part of the journal staff—instead, they should be &quot;peers&quot;, i.e. researchers in the same field as the paper in question. Both authors and reviewers are typically scientists employed and paid by universities, research institutes or corporations, or working on a research grant. The main motivation to participate in this work is to further science and gain scientific merit through publishing. Active academic researchers are expected to publish their work in scientific journals. This is important for a researcher&#x27;s career, because their qualifications and performance are often evaluated based on publication count (number of articles accepted to scientific journals) and publication impact (how important the journal is and how often the article is cited). This is one of the main criteria for candidates for tenured positions.

== Standards and impact ==
The standards that a journal uses to determine publication can vary widely. Some journals, such as &quot;Nature&quot;, &quot;Science&quot;, &quot;PNAS&quot;, and &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot;, have a reputation of publishing articles that mark a fundamental breakthrough in their respective fields. In many fields, a formal or informal hierarchy of scientific journals exists; the most prestigious journal in a field tends to be the most selective in terms of the articles it will select for publication, and usually will also have the highest impact factor. In some countries, journal rankings can be utilized for funding decisions and even evaluation of individual researchers, although they are poorly suited for that purpose.

== Reproducibility and replicability ==
For scientific journals, reproducibility and replicability of the scientific results are core concepts that allow other scientists to check and reproduce the results under the same conditions described in the paper or at least similar conditions and produce similar results with similar measurements of the same measurand or carried out under changed conditions of measurement. While the ability to reproduce the results based only on details included in the article is expected, verification of reproducibility by a third party is not generally required for publication. The reproducibility of results presented in an article is therefore judged implicitly by the quality of the procedures reported and agreement with the data provided. However, some journals in the field of chemistry such as &quot;Inorganic Syntheses&quot; and &quot;Organic Syntheses&quot; require independent reproduction of the results presented as part of the review process. The inability for independent researches to reproduce published results is widespread, with 70% of researchers reporting failure to reproduce another scientist&#x27;s results, including more than half who report failing to reproduce their own experiments. Sources of irreproducibility vary, including publication of falsified or misrepresented data and poor detailing of procedures.

==Types of articles==

There are several types of journal article; the exact terminology and definitions vary by field and specific journal, but often include:
*Letters (also called &quot;communications&quot;, and not to be confused with &quot;letters to the editor&quot;) are short descriptions of important current research findings that are usually fast-tracked for immediate publication because they are considered urgent.
*Research notes are short descriptions of current research findings that are considered less urgent or important than &quot;Letters&quot;.
*Articles are usually between five and twenty pages and are complete descriptions of current original research findings, but there are considerable variations between scientific fields and journals—80-page articles are not rare in mathematics or theoretical computer science.
*Supplemental articles contain a large volume of tabular data that is the result of current research and may be dozens or hundreds of pages with mostly numerical data. Some journals now only publish this data electronically on the Internet. Supplemental information also contains other voluminous material not appropriate for the main body of the article, like descriptions of routine procedures, derivations of equations, source code, non-essential data, spectra or other such miscellaneous information.
*A target article in a journal is one which argues a case, to which other authors submit a commentary or a response. There may be a final response from the author of the target article. See, for example, Alison Gopnik&#x27;s article &quot;How we know our minds: The illusion of first-person knowledge of intentionality&quot; in the journal &quot;Behavioral and Brain Sciences&quot;, Volume 16, Issue 1 (1993), which was one of a pair of &quot;target articles&quot; to which other responses were published in the same volume.
*Review articles do not cover original research but rather accumulate the results of many different &quot;articles&quot; on a particular topic into a coherent narrative about the state of the art in that field. Review articles provide information about the topic and also provide journal references to the original research. Reviews may be entirely narrative, or may provide quantitative summary estimates resulting from the application of meta-analytical methods.
*Data papers are articles dedicated to describe datasets. This type of article is becoming popular and journals exclusively dedicated to them have been established, e.g. &quot;Scientific Data&quot; and &quot;Earth System Science Data&quot;.
*Video papers are a recent addition to practice of scientific publications. They most often combine an online video demonstration of a new technique or protocol with a rigorous textual description.

The formats of journal articles vary, but many follow the general IMRAD scheme recommended by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. Such articles begin with an &quot;abstract&quot;, which is a one-to-four-paragraph summary of the paper. The &quot;introduction&quot; describes the background for the research including a discussion of similar research. The &quot;materials and methods&quot; or &quot;experimental&quot; section provides specific details of how the research was conducted. The &quot;results and discussion&quot; section describes the outcome and implications of the research, and the &quot;conclusion&quot; section places the research in context and describes avenues for further exploration.

In addition to the above, some scientific journals such as &quot;Science&quot; will include a news section where scientific developments (often involving political issues) are described. These articles are often written by science journalists and not by scientists. In addition, some journals will include an editorial section and a section for letters to the editor. While these are articles published within a journal, in general they are not regarded as scientific journal articles because they have not been peer-reviewed.

==Electronic publishing==

Electronic publishing is a new area of information dissemination. One definition of electronic publishing is in the context of the scientific journal. It is the presentation of scholarly scientific results in only an electronic (non-paper) form. This is from its first write-up, or creation, to its publication or dissemination. The electronic scientific journal is specifically designed to be presented on the internet. It is defined as not being previously printed material adapted, or retooled, and then delivered electronically.

Electronic publishing will likely continue to exist alongside paper publishing for the foreseeable future, since whilst output to a screen is important for browsing and searching, it is not well suited for extensive reading. Formats suitable both for reading on paper, and for manipulation by the reader&#x27;s computer will need to be integrated. Many journals are electronically available in formats readable on screen via web browsers, as well as in portable document format PDF, suitable for printing and storing on a local desktop or laptop computer. New tools such as JATS and Utopia Documents provide a &#x27;bridge&#x27; to the &#x27;web-versions&#x27; in that they connect the content in PDF versions directly to the World Wide Web via hyperlinks that are created &#x27;on-the-fly&#x27;. The PDF version of an article is usually seen as the version of record, but the matter is subject to some debate.

Electronic counterparts of established print journals already promote and deliver rapid dissemination of peer-reviewed and edited, &quot;published&quot; articles. Other journals, whether spin-offs of established print journals, or created as electronic only, have come into existence promoting the rapid dissemination capability, and availability, on the Internet. In tandem with this is the speeding up of peer review, copyediting, page makeup, and other steps in the process to support rapid dissemination.

Other improvements, benefits and unique values of electronically publishing the scientific journal are easy availability of supplementary materials (data, graphics and video), lower cost, and availability to more people, especially scientists from non-developed countries. Hence, research results from more developed nations are becoming more accessible to scientists from non-developed countries.

Moreover, electronic publishing of scientific journals has been accomplished without compromising the standards of the refereed, peer review process.

One form is the online equivalent of the conventional paper journal. By 2006, almost all scientific journals have, while retaining their peer-review process, established electronic versions; a number have moved entirely to electronic publication. In a similar manner, most academic libraries buy the electronic version and purchase a paper copy only for the most important or most-used titles.

There is usually a delay of several months after an article is written before it is published in a journal, making paper journals not an ideal format for announcing the latest research. Many journals now publish the final papers in their electronic version as soon as they are ready, without waiting for the assembly of a complete issue, as is necessary with paper. In many fields in which even greater speed is wanted, such as physics, the role of the journal at disseminating the latest research has largely been replaced by preprint databases such as arXiv.org. Almost all such articles are eventually published in traditional journals, which still provide an important role in quality control, archiving papers, and establishing scientific credit.

==Cost==

Many scientists and librarians have long protested the cost of journals, especially as they see these payments going to large for-profit publishing houses. To allow their researchers online access to journals, many universities purchase &quot;site licenses&quot;, permitting access from anywhere in the university, and, with appropriate authorization, by university-affiliated users at home or elsewhere. These may be quite expensive, sometimes much more than the cost for a print subscription, although this may reflect the number of people who will be using the license—while a print subscription is the cost for one person to receive the journal; a site-license can allow thousands of people to gain access.

Publications by scholarly societies, also known as not-for-profit-publishers, usually cost less than commercial publishers, but the prices of their scientific journals are still usually several thousand dollars a year. In general, this money is used to fund the activities of the scientific societies that run such journals, or is invested in providing further scholarly resources for scientists; thus, the money remains in and benefits the scientific sphere.

Despite the transition to electronic publishing, the serials crisis persists.

Concerns about cost and open access have led to the creation of free-access journals such as the Public Library of Science (PLoS) family and partly open or reduced-cost journals such as the &quot;Journal of High Energy Physics&quot;. However, professional editors still have to be paid, and PLoS still relies heavily on donations from foundations to cover the majority of its operating costs; smaller journals do not often have access to such resources.

Based on statistical arguments, it has been shown that electronic publishing online, and to some extent open access, both provide wider dissemination and increase the average number of citations an article receives.

==Copyright==
Traditionally, the author of an article was required to transfer the copyright to the journal publisher. Publishers claimed this was necessary in order to protect authors&#x27; rights, and to coordinate permissions for reprints or other use. However, many authors, especially those active in the open access movement, found this unsatisfactory, and have used their influence to effect a gradual move towards a license to publish instead. Under such a system, the publisher has permission to edit, print, and distribute the article commercially, but the authors retain the other rights themselves.

Even if they retain the copyright to an article, most journals allow certain rights to their authors. These rights usually include the ability to reuse parts of the paper in the author&#x27;s future work, and allow the author to distribute a limited number of copies. In the print format, such copies are called reprints; in the electronic format, they are called postprints. Some publishers, for example the American Physical Society, also grant the author the right to post and update the article on the author&#x27;s or employer&#x27;s website and on free e-print servers, to grant permission to others to use or reuse figures, and even to reprint the article as long as no fee is charged. The rise of open access journals, in which the author retains the copyright but must pay a publication charge, such as the Public Library of Science family of journals, is another recent response to copyright concerns.

The G7 leaders took a similar stand on May 14, 2023, as did the European Council on May 23. The tide is turning in favor of unrestricted access, but the countervailing forces are so complex that the future remains cloudy.&quot; (p. 73.)

<text>The Martian Chronicles is a science fiction fix-up novel, published in 1950, by American writer Ray Bradbury that chronicles the exploration and settlement of Mars, the home of indigenous Martians, by Americans leaving a troubled Earth that is eventually devastated by nuclear war.

==Synopsis==
The book projects American society immediately after World War II into a technologically advanced future where the amplification of humanity&#x27;s potentials to create and destroy have miraculous and devastating consequences. Events in the chronicle include the apocalyptic destruction of Martian and human civilizations, instigated by humans, though there are no stories with settings at the catastrophes. The outcomes of many stories raise concerns about the values and direction of America of the time by addressing militarism, science, technology and war-time prosperity that could result in a global nuclear war (e.g., &quot;There Will Come Soft Rains&quot; and &quot;The Million-Year Picnic&quot;); depopulation that might be considered genocide (e.g., &quot;The Third Expedition&quot;, &quot;—And the Moon Be Still as Bright&quot; and &quot;The Musicians&quot;); racial oppression and exploitation (e.g., &quot;Way in the Middle of the Air&quot;); ahistoricism, philistinism, and hostility towards religion (e.g., &quot;—And the Moon Be Still as Bright&quot;); censorship and conformity (e.g., &quot;Usher II&quot;). On Bradbury&#x27;s award of a Pulitzer Prize Special Citation in 2007, the book was recognized as one of his &quot;masterworks that readers carry with them over a lifetime&quot;.

==Structure and plot summary==
===Fix-up structure===
&quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; is a fix-up novel consisting of published short stories along with new short bridge narratives in the form of vignettes, intercalary chapters, or expository narratives. The published stories were revised for consistency and refinement.

&quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; may at first appear to be a planned short story cycle; Bradbury did not write &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; as a singular work – rather, its creation as a novel was suggested to Bradbury by a publisher&#x27;s editor years after most of the stories had already appeared in many different publications (see publication history and original publication notes under Contents). In responding to the suggestion, the 29-year-old Bradbury was shocked by the idea that he had already written a novel and remembers saying: &quot;Oh, my God... I read &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; by Sherwood Anderson when I was 24 and I said to myself, &#x27;Oh God, wouldn&#x27;t it be wonderful if someday I could write a book as good as this but put it on the planet Mars.&#x27;&quot;. (See the Influences section on literary influences affecting the works&#x27;s structure.)

===Chronicle structure===
&quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; is written as a chronicle, each story presented as a chapter within an overall chronological ordering of the plot. Overall, it can be viewed as three extended episodes or parts, punctuated by two apocalyptic events. Events in the book&#x27;s original edition ranged from 1999 to 2026. As 1999 approached in real life, the dates were advanced by 31 years in the 1997 edition. The summary that follows includes the dates of both editions.

* The first part covering two and a half years, from January 1999/2030 to June 2001/2032, consists of seven chapters about four exploratory missions from the United States, during which humans and Martians discover each other. The efforts of Martians to repel the human explorers ends in catastrophe when chicken pox brought to Mars by humans kills almost all Martians. Two of the chapters are original works for the fix-up.
* The second part covers four and a half years, from August 2001/2032 to December 2005/2036, and consists of sixteen chapters in the first edition and seventeen in the 1997 edition. It is about the human colonizers of Mars, including human contact with the few surviving Martians, the preoccupation of the emigrants with making Mars like America on Earth, and the return of all settlers but seven to Earth as war on Earth threatens. All of the settlers are from the United States, and the settlements are administered by the United States government. A global war on Earth ensues, and contact between Mars and Earth ends. Eleven of the chapters are original works for the first edition and thirteen for the 1997 edition.
* The third part, covering six months from April 2026/2057 to October 2026/2057, is three chapters about the remaining Martian settlers and the occurrence and aftermath of global nuclear war on Earth that eliminates human civilization there, and the few humans who manage to flee Earth and settle on Mars. None of the chapters are original works for the fix-up.

==Publication history==
The creation of &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; by weaving together previous works was suggested to the author by New York City representatives of Doubleday &amp; Company in 1949 after Norman Corwin recommended Bradbury travel to the city to be &quot;&#x27;discovered&#x27;&quot;. The work was subsequently published in hardbound form by Doubleday in the United States in 1950. Publication of the book was concurrent with the publication of Bradbury&#x27;s short story, &quot;There Will Come Soft Rains&quot; that appeared in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine. The short story appears as a chapter in the novel, though with some differences. The novel has been reprinted numerous times by many different publishers since 1950.

The Spanish language version of &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;, &quot;Crónicas Marcianas&quot;, was published in Argentina concurrently with the U.S. first edition, and included all the chapters contained in the U.S. edition. The edition included a foreword by Jorge Luis Borges.

The book was published in the United Kingdom under the title &quot;The Silver Locusts&quot; (1951), with slightly different contents. In some editions the story &quot;The Fire Balloons&quot; was added, and the story &quot;Usher II&quot; was removed to make room for it.

The book was published in 1963 as part of the Time Reading Program with an introduction by Fred Hoyle.

In 1979, Bantam Books published a trade paperback edition with illustrations by Ian Miller.

As 1999 approached, the fictional future written into the first edition was in jeopardy, so the work was revised and a 1997 edition was published to advance all of the dates by 31 years (with the plot running from 2030 to 2057 instead of 1999 to 2026). The 1997 edition added &quot;November 2033: The Fire Balloons&quot; and &quot;May 2034: The Wilderness&quot;, and omitted &quot;Way in the Middle of the Air&quot;, a story considered less topical in 1997 than 1950.

The 1997 edition of &quot;Crónicas Marcianas&quot; included the same revisions as the U.S. 1997 edition.

In 2009, the Subterranean Press and PS Publishing published &quot;The Martian Chronicles: The Complete Edition &quot;that included the 1997 edition of the work and additional stories under the title &quot;The Other Martian Tales&quot;. (See &quot;The Other Martian Tales&quot; section of this article.)

==Contents==
Bradbury culled the table of contents for &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; &quot;Chronology&quot; with each item formatted with the date of the story followed by a colon followed by the story title. The title of each chapter in the first edition was the corresponding line in &quot;Chronology&quot;. In the 1997 edition, chapter titles omitted the colons by printing the date and the story title on separate lines. The chapter titles that follow are formatted consistent with the &quot;Chronology&quot;. The years are those appearing in the first edition followed by the year appearing in 1997 edition.

They each regard each other as a dream.

The fearless Tomás Gomez reflects a common Mexican attitude toward death, which Bradbury understood. Prior to the publication of &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; in 1950, two of his short stories relating to the Day of the Dead were published in 1947 — &quot;El Día de Muerte&quot; set on the Day of the Dead in Mexico City and &quot;The Next in Line&quot; that was published in his book &quot;Dark Carnival&quot; about a visit to catacombs in a Mexican village which terrifies the American protagonist. Both stories were likely inspired by his learning about Mexican death rites during his own frightful experience on a 1945 trip to Mexico that included a visit in Guanajuato where he viewed mummies.

=== October 2002/2033: The Shore ===
==== Plot ====
This vignette characterizes two successive groups of settlers as American emigrants who arrive in &quot;waves&quot; that &quot;spread upon&quot; the Martian &quot;shore&quot; – the first are the frontiersmen described in &quot;The Settlers&quot;, and the second are men from the &quot;cabbage tenements and subways&quot; of urban America.

=== November 2002/2033: The Fire Balloons ===
==== Publication history ====
The story first appeared as &quot;…In This Sign&quot; in &quot;Imagination&quot;, April 1951 after publication of the first (1950) edition of &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; and so, was included in the U.S. edition of &quot;The Illustrated Man&quot; and in &quot;The Silver Locusts&quot;. The story was included in the 1997 edition of &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;, though it appeared in earlier special editions – the 1974 edition from The Heritage Press, the September 1979 illustrated trade edition from Bantam Books, the &quot;40th Anniversary Edition&quot; from Doubleday Dell Publishing Group and in the 2001 Book-of-the-Month Club edition.

==== Plot ====
&quot;The Fire Balloons&quot; is a story about an Episcopal missionary expedition to cleanse Mars of sin, consisting of priests from large American cities led by the Most Reverend Father Joseph Daniel Peregrine and his assistant Father Stone. Peregrine has a passionate interest in discovering the kinds of sins that may be committed by aliens reflected in his book, &quot;The Problem of Sin on Other Worlds&quot;. Peregrine and Stone argue constantly about whether the mission should focus on cleansing humans or Martians. With the question unanswered, the priests travel to Mars aboard the spaceship &quot;Crucifix&quot;. The launch of the rocket triggers Peregrine&#x27;s memories as a young boy of the Fourth of July with his grandfather.

After landing on Mars, Peregrine and Stone meet with the mayor of First City, who advises them to focus their mission on humans. The mayor tells the priests that the Martians look like blue &quot;luminous globes of light&quot; and they saved the life of an injured prospector working in a remote location by transporting him to a highway. The mayor&#x27;s description of the Martians triggers Peregine&#x27;s endearing memories of himself launching fire balloons with his grandfather on Independence Day.

Peregrine decides to search for and meet Martians, and he and Stone venture into the hills where the prospector encountered them. The two priests are met by a thousand fire balloons. Stone is terrified and wants to return to First City while Peregrine is overwhelmed by their beauty, imagines his grandfather is there with him to admire them, and wants to converse with them, though the fire balloons disappear. The two priests immediately encounter a rock slide, which Stone believes they escaped by chance and Peregrine believes they were saved by Martians. The two argue their disagreement, and during the night while Stone is sleeping, Peregrine tests his faith in his hunch by throwing himself off a high cliff. As he falls, Peregrine is surrounded by blue light and is set safely on the ground. Peregrine tells Stone of the experience but Stone believes Peregrine was dreaming, so Peregrine takes a gun which he fires at himself and the bullets drop at his feet, convincing his assistant.

Peregrine uses his authority to have the mission build a church in the hills for the Martians. The church is for outdoor services and is constructed after six days of work. A blue glass sphere is brought as a representation of Jesus for the Martians. On the seventh day, a Sunday, Peregrine holds a service in which he plays an organ and uses his thoughts to summon the Martians. The fire balloons, who call themselves the Old Ones, appear as glorious apparitions to the priests and communicate the story of their creation, their immortality, their normally solitary existences, and their pure virtuousness. They thank the priests for building the church and tell them they are unneeded and ask them to relocate to the towns to cleanse the people there. The fire balloons depart, which fills Peregrine with such overwhelming sadness that he wants to be lifted up like his grandfather did when he was a small child. The priests are convinced and withdraw to First Town along with the blue glass sphere that has started to glow from within. Peregrine and Stone believe the sphere is Jesus.

Bradbury said he consulted a Catholic priest in Beverly Hills while he developed the plot for &quot;Fire Balloons&quot;. In an interview, Bradbury recalled part of a day-long conversation: &quot;&#x27;Listen, Father, how would you act if you landed on Mars and found intelligent creatures in the form of balls of fire? Would you think you ought to save them or would you think they were saved already?&#x27; &#x27;Wow! That&#x27;s a hell of a fine question!&#x27; the father exclaimed. And he told me what he would do. In short, what I make Father Peregrine do.&quot;

Interpretation of &quot;The Fire Balloons&quot; has been called &quot;ambiguous&quot; because its meaning can be dramatically different due to the context set by the stories that accompany it. Its first appearance in the U.S. in 1951 was as a stand-alone story as &quot;... In This Sign&quot; and in &quot;The Illustrated Man&quot; that was concurrent with its first appearance in &quot;The Silver Locusts&quot; in the U.K. which included all of &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; stories with Martian characters. Within &quot;The Silver Locusts&quot; and the 1997 edition of &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; the strategy used by Martians in &quot;The Fire Balloons&quot; is implicit – they use their telepathic powers to peacefully keep settlers away from their mountains. As in &quot;Ylla&quot; the Martians understand Father Peregrine&#x27;s fond memories of his grandfather and the Fourth of July celebrations they shared together involving fire balloons before and after the &quot;Crucifix&quot; lands on Mars. As in &quot;The Earth Men&quot;, an elaborate, imaginary world is constructed, though in &quot;The Fire Balloons&quot; it is for the priests to convince them to cleanse humans of sin in First City. The appearance of Martians as fire balloons ends with the chapter.

=== June 2003: Way in the Middle of the Air ===
==== Publication history ====
First appeared in the first edition of &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; and not included in the 1997 edition. 
The work later appeared in the July 1950 issue of &quot;Other Worlds Science Stories&quot; after five major magazines rejected the manuscript drafted in 1948.

Bradbury explained that the drafting of &quot;Way in the Middle of the Air&quot; was a common way he used writing to address his emotional state affecting him at a moment. He recalled in a 1962 interview that he was so upset about the circumstances of African-Americans in the United States that &quot;I put them in rocket ships and send them off to Mars, in a short story, to rid myself of that tension&quot;.

Publication of &quot;Way in the Middle of the Air&quot; in 1950 was groundbreaking for a science fiction story even though the work is considered limited by providing only the viewpoint of white Americans. According to Isiah Lavender III, &quot;Bradbury is one of the very few authors in [science fiction] who dared to consider the effects and consequences of race in America at a time when racism was sanctioned by the culture.&quot; Even with the story&#x27;s limitations, Robert Crossley suggested that it might be considered &quot;the single most incisive episode of black and white relations in science fiction by a white author.&quot;

==== Plot ====

&quot;Way in the Middle of the Air&quot; is the story about Samuel Teece, a white racist hardware store owner in an unnamed town in the Jim Crow era American South of 2003, and his efforts to dissuade the African-Americans in the town area from emigrating to Mars. Teece and a group of white men sit on the porch of his hardware store when they see a flood of black families and others marching into town with their belongings. One of the men tells Teece that the entire community has decided to leave for Mars. Teece is incensed and declares that the governor and militia should be contacted because the migrants should have notified everyone in advance before departing.

As the migrants pass the store, Teece&#x27;s wife, accompanied by the wives of other men on the porch, asks her husband to come home to prevent their house servant, Lucinda, from leaving. Mrs. Teece says she couldn&#x27;t convince Lucinda from leaving after offering an increase in pay and two nights a week off, and said she didn&#x27;t understand her decision because she thought Lucinda loved her. Teece restrains himself from beating his wife, and orders her to go back home. She obeys, and after she&#x27;s gone he takes his gun out and threatens to kill any migrant who laughs. The march continues quietly through town toward the rocket launch site.

Teece sees a black man, Belter, and threatens to horsewhip him because Belter owes him fifty dollars. Belter tells Teece that he forgot about the debt, and Teece tells Belter that he shouldn&#x27;t leave because his rocket will explode but Belter responds that he doesn&#x27;t care. Teece calls Belter &quot;Mister Way in the Middle of the Air&quot; taken from the lyrics of the negro spiritual &quot;Ezekiel Saw the Wheel&quot; about a vision of the prophet Ezekiel that occurred in the sky. After Belter begs Teece to let him depart for Mars, an old man among the migrants passes his hat around and quickly collects fifty dollars in donations from other migrants and gives it to Belter, who gives it to Teece and leaves. Teece is enraged and waves his gun at the migrants and threatens to shoot their rockets down one by one. The men on Teece&#x27;s porch ponder the reason for the mass migration mentioning advances in civil rights like elimination of the poll tax, some states enacting anti-lynching laws, &quot;all kinds of equal rights&quot;, and that the wages of black men are nearly on par with white men.

After almost all of the migrants have passed through town, Silly, Teece&#x27;s seventeen year old black employee, comes to the porch to return Teece&#x27;s bicycle Silly uses for deliveries. Teece shoves Silly off the machine and orders Silly to go inside the hardware store and start working. Silly doesn&#x27;t move and Teece pulls out a contract he says Silly signed with an &quot;X&quot; that requires the boy to &quot;give four weeks notice and continue working until his position is filled&quot;. Silly says he didn&#x27;t sign a contract and Teece responds by saying he will treat the boy well. Silly asks one of the white men on the porch if one of them will take his place and Grandpa Quartermain volunteers so Silly can leave. Teece claims Silly as his and says he&#x27;ll lock the boy in the back room until the evening. Silly starts to cry and then three other men on the porch tell Teece to let Silly go. Teece feels for the gun in his pocket and then relents. Silly cleans out his shed at the store on orders from Teece and departs the store in an old car. As Silly leaves, he asks Teece what he is going to do at night when all the black people are gone. After the car drives away, Teece figures out that Silly was asking about lynchings Teece participated in, and gets his open-top car to chase down Silly and kill him. Quartermain volunteers to drive, and in their pursuit a tire goes flat after running over cast off belongings that migrants abandoned onto the road. Teece returns to his store where men are watching rockets shooting up into the sky. Teece refuses to watch and proudly comments that Silly addressed him as &quot;Mister&quot; to the very end.

=== 2004–2005/2035–2036: The Naming of Names ===
==== Publication history ====
First appeared in &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;. (Not to be confused with the short story &quot;The Naming of Names&quot;, first published in &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot;, August 1949, later published as &quot;Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed&quot;.)

==== Plot ====
&quot;The Naming of Names&quot; is a short vignette about the names of places on Mars being given American names that memorialize the crews of the four exploratory expeditions, or &quot;mechanical&quot; or &quot;metal&quot; names, which replace the Martian names that were for geographic features and things in nature.

The vignette also describes tourists who visit Mars and shop, and describes the next wave of emigrants as &quot;sophisticates&quot; and people who &quot;instruct&quot; and &quot;rule&quot; and &quot;push&quot; other people about.

=== April 2005/2036: Usher II ===
==== Publication history ====
First published as &quot;Carnival of Madness&quot; in &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot;, April 1950. In 2010, Los Angeles artist Allois, in collaboration with Bradbury, released illustrated copies of &quot;Usher&quot; and &quot;Usher II&quot;. The story also appeared in the 2008 Harper Collins/ Voyager edition of &quot;The Illustrated Man&quot;.

==== Plot ====

&quot;Usher II&quot; is a horror story and homage to Edgar Allan Poe about the wealthy William Stendahl and the house he built to murder his enemies. The story begins with Stendahl&#x27;s meeting with Mr. Bigelow, his architect, to perform a final check-out for the completion of his newly built house. Stendahl reads Bigelow architectural specifications taken directly from the description of the House of Usher from the text of Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;. Stendahl is satisfied and refers to the house as, The House of Usher. The owner is angered that Bigelow doesn&#x27;t know anything of or about Poe and sends him away. Bigelow&#x27;s ignorance is innocent because for decades, anything &quot;produced in any way suggesting ... any creature of the imagination&quot; has been outlawed, including books, many of which were confiscated and burned in the Great Fire thirty-five years earlier, including Stendahl&#x27;s own fifty thousand book library.

Stendahl is visited by Mr. Garrett, an investigator of Moral Climates, who immediately tells Stendahl that he will have his place dismantled and burned later that day. Stendahl tells Garrett that he spent a huge sum of money for the house and invites the investigator inside for additional information for his investigative report. During the tour, Garrett experiences an automated horror fantasy world, and finds the place &quot;deplorable&quot; as well as a work of genius. Garrett is met by a robot ape that Stendahl demonstrates is a robot and then orders it to kill Garrett. Stendahl has his assistant Pikes, whom he regards as the greatest horror film actor ever when such films were made, construct a robot replica of Garrett to return to Moral Climates to delay any action affecting the house for forty-eight hours. Stendahl and Pikes send invitations out to their enemies for a party later that evening.

About thirty guests arrive at Stendahl&#x27;s party. Upon greeting them, he tells them to enjoy themselves because the house will soon be destroyed, though Pikes interrupts and shows Stendahl the remnants of Garrett, which are the parts of a robot. They first panic and then Stendahl figures the real Garrett will come to visit since they sent a robot back, and very soon Garrett appears and informs Stendahl that the Dismantlers will arrive in an hour. Stendahl tells Garrett to enjoy the party and offers him some wine that is politely refused. Garrett and Miss Pope then observe Miss Blunt being strangled by an ape and her corpse being stuffed up a chimney. Another laughing Miss Blunt comforts Miss Pope by telling her that what she saw killed was a robot replica of herself. Stendahl serves Garrett wine which he drinks. Garrett watches additional killings performed in a similar manner that he remembers from Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Premature Burial&quot;, &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot;, and one other from &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;. Stendahl serves Garrett more wine which is consumed and asks the investigator if he would like to see what is planned for him. Garrett agrees and is treated as the character Fortunato from Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot;. After Stendahl and Pikes have disposed of all their guests, they leave in a helicopter and, from above, watch the house break apart like the one in Poe&#x27;s story.

=== September 2005/2036: The Martian ===
==== Publication history ====
First published in &quot;Super Science Stories&quot;, November 1949.

==== Plot ====

&quot;The Martian&quot; is the story about an elderly married couple, LaFarge and Anna, who encounter a Martian who wants to live with them as their fourteen-year-old son, Tom, even though Tom died of pneumonia many years before. On a rainy night, Lafarge mentions his grief for Tom to Anna, who asks him to &quot;forget him and everything on Earth&quot;. They go to bed but before they can sleep they respond to a knock at their front door and find a boy who looks like Tom there. Anna is afraid but LaFarge thinks of the boy as Tom. Anna tells the boy to leave and asks her husband to lock the door, but LaFarge tells the boy that he can enter the house if he wants to and shuts the door unlocked. The next morning, LaFarge finds the boy bathing in the canal adjacent to his house while his wife treats the boy as her son with no discernible sign of concern or doubt. LaFarge asks the boy to give his true identity and guesses he is a Martian. The boy asks to be accepted and not to be doubted, and then runs away. Anna becomes distressed as she sees the boy running away, and LaFarge asks his wife if she remembers anything about Tom&#x27;s death. Anna responds that she doesn&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s talking about.

The boy returns late in the afternoon and makes an agreement with LaFarge on not asking any more questions. The boy says he was almost &quot;trapped&quot; by a man living in a tin shack by the canal after he ran away. After the boy leaves LaFarge to prepare for suppertime, Saul in a canal boat tells LaFarge that Nomland, the man living in the tin shack known to have murdered a man named Gillings on Earth, said Nomland saw Gillings that afternoon and tried to lock himself in the jail, and when he couldn&#x27;t, went home and shot himself dead only twenty minutes earlier. LaFarge asks the boy what he did during the afternoon, and the boy responds, &quot;Nothing&quot; and LaFarge stops the questioning.

LaFarge, Anna, and the boy leave the house on a canal boat over fearful objections of the boy. The boy falls asleep in the boat and talks in his sleep about &quot;changing&quot; and &quot;the trap&quot; which the couple don&#x27;t understand. Soon after they arrive in the town and start to meet numerous people, the boy runs off. Anna is distressed and Tom reassures her that the boy will return before they leave. The couple buys theater tickets and return to the canal boat late at night when the entertainment ends, but the boy is not there. LaFarge goes into town to find the boy and meets Mike who tells him that Joe Spaulding and his wife found their daughter, Lavinia, on Main Street while buying their theater tickets. LaFarge goes to the Spaulding&#x27;s house and finds Lavinia, though he calls her Tom, and asks Lavinia to come back to him and Anna. LaFarge makes a fatherly commitment and Lavinia leaves with LaFarge, though the departure is detected and her father shoots at them and misses. As they flee, LaFarge sends the boy off in a different direction to rendezvous at the canal boat where Anna awaits. As the boy runs through town his appearance changes to a figure that is recognizable to each person who sees him. The boy makes it to the boat where LaFarge and Anna await, but Joe Spaulding has a gun and stops their departure. The boy steps off the boat and Spaulding takes his wrist while all the people around him claim the boy is theirs. As the crowd argues, the boy sickens and screams as his appearance changes rapidly and uncontrollably from one recognizable figure to a person in the crowd to another, and then dies. It starts to rain again. LaFarge and Anna return home and go to bed. At midnight, LaFarge hears something at the door, opens it to a rainy night and watches the empty yard for five minutes before locking the door shut.

=== November 2005/2036: The Luggage Store ===
==== Publication history ====
First appeared in &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;.

==== Plot ====
&quot;The Luggage Store&quot; is a short dialogue between Father Peregrine and the elderly owner of a luggage store. The proprietor tells Peregrine that he heard on the radio that there will be a war on Earth, looks at Earth in the night sky, and tells the priest he finds the news incredible. Peregrine changes the proprietor&#x27;s mind by telling him that news of war is unbelievable because Earth is so far away. The shop owner tells the priest of the hundred thousand new emigrants expected in the coming months and Peregrine comments that the travelers will be needed on Earth and that they&#x27;ll probably be turning back. The proprietor tells the priest that he&#x27;d better prepare his luggage for a quick sale after which the priest asks if the owner thinks all the emigrants on Mars will return to Earth. The owner believes so because the emigrants haven&#x27;t been on Mars for long, except for himself because he is so old. Peregrine tells the shopkeeper that he&#x27;s wrong about staying on Mars. The owner is convinced again by the priest, and Peregrine buys a new valise to replace his old one.

=== November 2005/2036: The Off Season ===
==== Publication history ====
First published in &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot;, December 1948.

==== Plot ====
&quot;The Off Season&quot; is the story of former Fourth Expedition crewman Sam Parkhill, who is a character in &quot;—And The Moon Be Still As Bright&quot;, and his wife Elma, and their encounters with Martians as they prepare to open the first hot dog stand on Mars, which is decorated with glass Sam broke off old Martian buildings. The Parkhills hope to become wealthy because one hundred thousand new emigrants are expected to arrive to establish Earth Settlement 101 nearby, though Elma points out that the new inhabitants will be Mexican and Chinese nationals. The couple is unaware that Earth is on the brink of global war because their radio is broken.

During the evening, the Parkhills are approached by a Martian they spoke to earlier that day. The Martian learns the Parkhills don&#x27;t know about the situation on Earth and as the Martian says he wants to show Sam a bronze tube that appears in the Martian&#x27;s hand. Sam shoots the Martian dead with a gun believing the tube is a weapon. However, Elma discovers the tube contains a document written with Martian hieroglyphics neither of them understand. As Sam tells Elma that the Earth Settlement will protect him from Martians, Elma sees twelve Martian sand ships approaching and Sam believes the Martians want to kill him. Sam takes Elma onto a Martian sand ship he purchased at an auction and learned to operate, and takes off to a town for protection. As Sam&#x27;s sand ship sails, a young woman appears on the ship&#x27;s tiller bench. The woman, a vision, tells Sam to return to the hot dog stand. Sam refuses and tells the women to get off his ship. The vision argues that the ship isn&#x27;t his and claims it as part of the Martian world. Sam shoots the vision and it vanishes after breaking into crystals and vaporizing. Elma is disappointed in Sam and asks him to stop the ship, but Sam refuses. In frustration and to display his might, Sam destroys the crystal ruins of a Martian city by shooting them as the sand ship passes by, though Elma is unimpressed and then falls unconscious.

As Sam readies to shoot up another Martian city, three sand ships catch up with him. Sam shoots at them and one ship disintegrates and vaporizes along with its crew. As the two other ships approach Sam&#x27;s, he gives up by stopping his ship. A Martian calls him, and Sam explains himself and surrenders by throwing down his gun. The Martian tells him to retrieve his gun and return to the hot dog stand where they want to explain something without harming him. Elma wakes up on the journey back.

Back at the hot dog stand, the Martian Leader tells the Parkhills to ready it for operation and to have a celebration. The Leader produces the scrolls which he explains are grants to Sam that sum to half of the entire planet. Sam asks the Leader for an explanation for the gift but the Martians announce their departure and tell him to &quot;prepare&quot; and repeat that the land is his. Sam believes the Martians were telling him the rockets with the new emigrants are arriving, so Sam and Elma start preparing hot dogs. As they prepare food, Sam thinks of the hungry emigrants to feed and botches recitation of Emma Lazarus&#x27; poem &quot;The New Colossus&quot; which is on a plaque at the Statue of Liberty in Sam&#x27;s hometown, New York City. Elma looks at Earth in the night sky and sees an explosion on the planet that gains Sam&#x27;s attention. Elma tells Sam she believes no customers will be coming to the hot dog stand for a million years.

In &quot;—And the Moon Be Still as Bright&quot;, the bodies of dead Martians are corpses. Sam Parkhill&#x27;s shooting of the Martians dead at his hot dog stand and on his sand ship are illusions projected by one or more Martians somewhere else.

=== April 2026/2057: The Long Years ===
==== Publication history ====
First published in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, September 15, 1948.

==== Plot ====

&quot;The Long Years&quot; is the story of the last days of the life of Hathaway, the physician/geologist crewman from the Fourth Expedition&#x27;s story &quot;—And the Moon Still Be As Bright&quot;. At night during a windstorm, Hathaway visits four graves on a hill away from his family&#x27;s hut and asks the dead for forgiveness for what he&#x27;s done because he was lonely. As he returns to the hut, he spots a rocket approaching. He tells the family of the &quot;good news&quot; of a rocket arrival in the morning. He goes to the nearby ruins of New New York City and sets it ablaze as a location for the rocket to land. Hathaway returns to the hut to serve wine to his family in celebration. He reminisces about missing all the rockets evacuating colonists from Mars when the Great War started because he and his whole family were doing archaeological work in the mountains. As his wife and three children drink their wine it all just runs down their chins.

In the morning, the family prepares to greet whoever is in the rocket ship, including a great breakfast. As the rocket lands, Hathaway suffers an angina attack while running toward it. He recovers and continues on. Wilder, who was captain of the Fourth Expedition, emerges, sees Hathaway and greets him. Wilder explains that he&#x27;s been on a twenty-year mission to the outer solar system; reports that he surveyed Mars before landing and found only one other person, Walter Gripp, who decided to stay on Mars, Wilder ponders with Hathaway the fate of Earth; and agrees to take Hathaway and his family on his return to Earth. Hathaway compliments Wilder on his promotion to lead the twenty-year mission so that Wilder would not slow the development of Mars. Wilder orders his crew out of the spaceship to join Hathaway&#x27;s family.

On their way to the family hut, Hathaway updates Wilder on the Fourth Expedition&#x27;s crewmen. Hathway tells Wilder that he visits Jeff Spender&#x27;s tomb annually to pay his respects, and about Sam Parkhill&#x27;s hot dog stand which was abandoned a week after opening to return to Earth. Wilder observes Hathaway in physical distress and has his physician crewman check Hathaway. Hathaway tells Wilder that he has stayed alive just to await rescue and now that Wilder has arrived he can die. The doctor gives him a pill and then says what he just spoke was &quot;nonsense&quot;. Hathway recovers and continues on to the family hut.

At the hut, Hathaway introduces his family to the crew. Wilder is struck by how young Hathaway&#x27;s wife appears, given that he met her decades earlier, and he compliments her on her youthfulness. Wilder asks John, Hathaway&#x27;s son, his age, and John answers twenty-three. Crewman Williamson tells Wilder that John is supposed to be forty-two. Wilder sends Williamson off to investigate on the pretense of checking up on their rocket. Williamson returns to report that he found the graves of Hathaway&#x27;s wife and children, and that the gravestones said that they died of an unknown disease during July 2007/2038.

As breakfast ends, Hathaway stands and toasts the crew and his family, and as soon he is done he collapses and knows that he will soon be dead. Wilder wants to call the family in to see Hathaway, but Hathaway stops him. Hathaway says they won&#x27;t understand and wouldn&#x27;t want them to understand, and then dies. Wilder converses with Hathaway&#x27;s wife and concludes that she and the children are all androids, created by Hathaway to keep him company after his wife and children died. The crew buries Hathaway in his family&#x27;s graveyard.

As Wilder prepares to depart, Williamson asks Wilder about what should be done about the android family and specially asks whether they should be deactivated. Wilder rejects taking them to Earth and says deactivation never crossed his mind. Wilder hands Williamson a gun and tells the crewman that if he can do anything it is better than anything he can do. Williamson goes into the hut and returns to Wilder reporting that he pointed the gun at an android daughter, who responded by smiling, and that he felt shooting them would be &quot;murder&quot;. Wilder speculates the androids could operate for up to two more centuries. The rocket departs, and the android family continues on with its endless routines, that includes, for no reason at all, the android wife nightly looking up at Earth in the sky and tending a fire.

=== August 2026/2057: There Will Come Soft Rains ===

==== Publication history ====
First published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, May 6, 1950, and revised for inclusion in &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;.

==== Plot ====
An unoccupied, highly automated house of the McClellan family that stands and operates intact in a California city that is otherwise obliterated by a nuclear bomb, and its destruction by a fire caused by a windstorm. The story marks the end of the United States as a nation. The story also commemorates the United States&#x27; atomic bombing of Hiroshima on August 5, 1945 (US time) during World War II. The title of the story was taken from Sara Teasdale&#x27;s anti-war poem &quot;There Will Come Soft Rains&quot; originally published in 1918 during World War I and the 1918 Flu Pandemic.

=== October 2026/2057: The Million-Year Picnic ===
==== Publication history ====
First published in &quot;Planet Stories&quot;, summer 1946.

==== Plot ====

&quot;The Million-Year Picnic&quot; is the story of William Thomas, a former governor of the state of Minnesota and Alice, his wife, and three sons, who traveled to Mars to escape war under the parents&#x27; pretense that the family is taking a fishing trip. Alice is not noticeably pregnant with a girl. The family enjoys a warm Martian summer day in and along water-filled canals traveling in a power boat prepared for an encampment. William is troubled by the war on Earth and does his best to keep the children entertained though he mutters his concerns as stray thoughts his children don&#x27;t completely comprehend. William draws the boys&#x27; attention on fish, the ancient Martian cities they pass by, and on finding Martians – the latter, William assures the boys that they will find. While boating in a canal William and his wife listen to a broadcast on their atomic radio and are jolted by what they hear. William remotely detonates the family&#x27;s rocket that causes a great sound, throttles the boat faster to drown out the noise and collides with a wharf and stops. No damage is done and William laughingly tells everyone he just exploded their rocket. The boys instantly think it is part of a game. William tells the boys he did it to keep their location secret, and the boys think it is still part of a game. William listens in on the atomic radio again and hears nothing for a couple of minutes. He tells the family, &quot;It&#x27;s over at last&quot; and the children fall silent. William boats down the canal where they pass six Martian cities and asks the family to choose the best one. They all choose the last one and William declares that it will be their new home. The boys are saddened to tears about missing Minnesota but the father tells the boys that the Martian city is theirs and the boys become filled with a sense of adventure. The family walks through their new city and William tells the family that they will be joined by Bert Edward&#x27;s family that includes four girls. He tells his son Timothy that he destroyed the rocket to prevent them from returning to Earth and to leave no trace for &quot;evil men&quot; from Earth to find them.

The family settles around a campfire and William explains how he purchased the rocket when the Great War started and hid it in case he needed to escape Earth, as Edwards did too. The father burns in a campfire a variety of documents, including government bonds, he brought to Mars to burn &quot;a way of life&quot;. While he burns his papers, he tells his sons that Earth has been destroyed, that interplanetary travel has ended, that people grew too dependent on technology and couldn&#x27;t manage its war time use, and that the way of life on Earth &quot;proved itself wrong&quot; through its own self-destruction. He warns his sons that he will tell them the last point everyday until they really understand it. William finishes burning his papers, saving a map of Earth for last. William takes the family to the canal and tells the children that they will be taught what they need to learn and that they are going to see Martians. William stops at the canal and points to the family&#x27;s reflection in the water.

==Influences==
===Fascination with Mars, the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs, and comics===
Bradbury&#x27;s fascination with Mars started when he was a child, including depictions of Mars in the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; &quot;The Gods of Mars&quot; and &quot;John Carter, Warrior of Mars&quot;. Burroughs&#x27; influence on the author was immense, as Bradbury believed &quot;Burroughs is probably the most influential writer in the entire history of the world.&quot; Bradbury said that as a child, he memorized all of John Carter and Tarzan and repeated the stories to anyone who would listen. Harold Foster&#x27;s 1931 series of Tarzan Sunday comics had such an impact on his life that &quot;&quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; would never have happened&quot; otherwise.

===Literary influences===
Ray Bradbury referred to &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; as &quot;a book of stories pretending to be a novel&quot;. He credited a diverse set of literary influences that had an effect on the structure and literary style of &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;, among them Sherwood Anderson, William Shakespeare, Saint-John Perse, and John Steinbeck, as well as Edgar Rice Burroughs, particularly the Barsoom stories and John Carter of Mars books.

Bradbury was particularly inspired by plot and character development in Sherwood Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; that helped him write &quot;vivid and real&quot; stories that improved his earlier writings that were &quot;lifeless robots, mechanical and motionless&quot;. The author said the stories took their form as combinations of component &quot;Martian pensées&quot; which were &quot;Shakespearian &#x27;asides,&#x27; wandering thoughts, long night visions, predawn half-dreams&quot; honed in a manner inspired by the perfection of Saint-John Perse.

The combination of separate stories to create &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; as &quot;a half-cousin to a novel&quot; was a suggestion of Doubleday editor Walter Bradbury (no relation to the author), who paid Ray Bradbury $750 for the outline of the book. The author only then realized such a book would be comparable to his idea of &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot;. For his approach to integrating previous work into a novel, Bradbury credited Sherwood Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; and John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; as influences on the structure of the work. &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; is a short story cycle, and &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; separates narrative chapters with narrative expositions that serve as prologues to subsequent narrative chapters. The idea of using short vignettes, intercalary chapters, and expository narratives to connect the full-length &quot;Chronicle&quot; stories, their role in the overall work, and the literary style used to write them, Bradbury said were &quot;subconsciously borrowed&quot; from those in &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, which he first read at age nineteen, the year the novel was published.

==Reception==
Upon publication, &quot;The Paris Review&quot; noted that &quot;&quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; ... was embraced by the science-fiction community as well as critics, a rare achievement for the genre. Christopher Isherwood hailed Bradbury as &#x27;truly original&#x27; and a &#x27;very great and unusual talent&#x27;.&quot; Isherwood argued that Bradbury&#x27;s works were &quot;tales of the grotesque and arabesque&quot;, and compared them to the works of Edgar Allan Poe, writing that Bradbury &quot;already deserves to be measured against the greatest master of his particular genre.&quot; Writer and critic Anthony Boucher and critic J. Francis McComas praised &quot;Chronicles&quot; as &quot;a poet&#x27;s interpretation of future history beyond the limits of any fictional form&quot;. The writer L. Sprague de Camp, however, declared that Bradbury would improve &quot;when he escapes from the influence of Hemingway and Saroyan&quot;, placing him in &quot;the tradition of anti-science-fiction writers [who] see no good in the machine age&quot;. Still, de Camp acknowledged that Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;stories have considerable emotional impact, and many will love them&quot;.

A decade of after its publication, Damon Knight in his &quot;Books&quot; column for &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; listed &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; on his top-ten science fiction books of the 1950s.

By September 1979 more than three million copies of &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; had been sold.

== Legacy ==
=== Continued popularity of &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; ===
On November 28, 1964, the NASA spacecraft Mariner 4 flew by Mars and took the first close-up pictures of the Martian surface that were far different than those described by Ray Bradbury. In spite of direct visual and scientific information since then that indicate Mars is nothing like Bradbury&#x27;s descriptions in &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;, the novel remains a popular work of &quot;classic short stories&quot;, &quot;science fiction&quot;, and &quot;classic fiction anthologies and collections&quot; as indicated by the Amazon book store best seller lists. In an introduction to a 2015 edition of the work, Canadian astronaut and former International Space Station commander Chris Hadfield speculated on the continuing popularity of the work, attributing it to beautiful descriptions of the Martian landscape, its ability to &quot;challenge and inspire&quot; the reader to reflect on humanity&#x27;s history of related follies and failures, and the popular idea that someday some people will come to accept Mars as being their permanent home. Bradbury attributed the attraction of readers to his book because the story is a myth or fable rather than science fiction. He said &quot;... even the most deeply rooted physicists at Cal-Tech accept breathing the fraudulent oxygen atmosphere I have loosed on Mars. Science and machines can kill each other off or be replaced. Myth, seen in mirrors, incapable of being touched, stays on. If it is not immortal, it almost seems such.&quot;

=== Bradbury Landing on Mars ===
The August 6, 2012, Martian landing site of &quot;Curiosity&quot;, NASA&#x27;s Mars Rover, was named Bradbury Landing in honor of Ray Bradbury on August 22, 2012, on what would have been the author&#x27;s 92nd birthday. On naming it, Michael Meyer, NASA program scientist for &quot;Curiosity&quot;, said: &quot;This was not a difficult choice for the science team. Many of us and millions of other readers were inspired in our lives by stories Ray Bradbury wrote to dream of the possibility of life on Mars.&quot;

==Adaptations==
===Theater===
A stage production of &quot;Way in the Middle of the Air&quot; was produced at the Desilu Studios Gower Studios, Hollywood, California in 1962.

The debut of a theater adaptation of &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; was at the Cricket Theater (The Ritz) in Northeast Minneapolis in 1976.

===Film===
MGM bought the film rights in 1960 but no film was made.

In 1988, the Soviet Armenian studio Armenfilm produced the feature film &quot;The 13th Apostle&quot;, starring Juozas Budraitis, Donatas Banionis, Armen Dzhigarkhanyan, based on &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;. The film was directed by Armenian actor and screenwriter, Suren Babayan.

The Uzbek filmmaker Nozim To&#x27;laho&#x27;jayev made two films based on sections from the book: 1984&#x27;s animated short &quot;There Will Come Soft Rains&quot; (Russian: Будет ласковый дождь) and 1987&#x27;s full-length live action film &quot;Veld&quot; (Russian: Вельд), with one of the subplots based on &quot;The Martian&quot;.

In 2011 Paramount Pictures acquired the film rights with the intention of producing a film franchise, with John Davis producing through Davis Entertainment.

===Music===
&quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; was adapted as a full-length contemporary opera by composer Daniel Levy and librettist Elizabeth Margid. This is the only musical adaptation authorized by Bradbury himself, who turned down Lerner and Loewe in the 1960s when they asked his permission to make a musical based on the novel. The work received its initial readings from the Harriet Lake Festival of New Plays at the Orlando Shakespeare Theater in 2006, and was presented in workshop form in the inaugural season of the Fordham University Lincoln Center Alumni Company in 2008. The &quot;Night Meeting&quot; episode was presented at Cornelia Street Cafe&#x27;s &quot;Entertaining Science&quot; series on June 9, 2013. The entire work was presented as a staged reading with a cast of Broadway actors at Ars Nova NYC on February 11, 2015. Three scenes were presented as a workshop production with immersive staging, directed by Carlos Armesto of Theatre C and conducted by Benjamin Smoulder at Miami University, Oxford OH on September 17–19, 2015.

In 2001 a Danish melodic metal band Royal Hunt released a concept album called &quot;The Mission,&quot; based on &quot;The Martian Chronicles.&quot;

Hungarian Progressive rock band Solaris named their first studio album “Marsbéli Krónikák” in honour of The Martian Chronicles

===Radio===
&quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; was adapted for radio in the science fiction radio series &quot;Dimension X&quot;. This truncated version contained elements of the stories &quot;Rocket Summer&quot;, &quot;Ylla&quot;, &quot;–and the Moon Be Still as Bright&quot;, &quot;The Settlers&quot;, &quot;The Locusts&quot;, &quot;The Shore&quot;, &quot;The Off Season&quot;, &quot;There Will Come Soft Rains&quot;, and &quot;The Million-Year Picnic&quot;.

&quot;—and the Moon Be Still as Bright&quot; and &quot;There Will Come Soft Rains&quot; were also adapted for separate episodes in the same series. The short stories &quot;Mars Is Heaven&quot; and &quot;Dwellers in Silence&quot; also appeared as episodes of &quot;Dimension X&quot;. The latter is in a very different form from the one found in &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;.

A very abridged spoken word reading of &quot;There Will Come Soft Rains&quot; and &quot;Usher II&quot; was made in 1975 with Leonard Nimoy as narrator.

A BBC Radio 4 adaption, produced by Andrew Mark Sewell as an hour-long programme and starring Derek Jacobi as Captain Wilder, was broadcast on June 21, 2014, as part of the &quot;Dangerous Visions&quot; series.

===Television miniseries===

In 1979 NBC partnered with the BBC to commission &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;, a three-episode miniseries adaptation running just over four hours. It was written by Richard Matheson and was directed by Michael Anderson. Rock Hudson starred as Wilder, Darren McGavin as Parkhill, Bernadette Peters as Genevieve Selsor, Bernie Casey as Jeff Spender, Roddy McDowall as Father Stone, and Barry Morse as Hathaway, as well as Fritz Weaver. Bradbury found the miniseries &quot;just boring&quot;.

===Television adaptations of individual stories===
The cable television series &quot;The Ray Bradbury Theater&quot; adapted some individual short stories from &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; including &quot;Mars is Heaven&quot;, &quot;The Earthmen&quot;, &quot;And the Moon Be Still as Bright&quot;, &quot;Usher II&quot;, &quot;The Martian&quot;, &quot;Silent Towns&quot;, and &quot;The Long Years&quot;. Video releases of the series included a VHS tape entitled &quot;Ray Bradbury&#x27;s Chronicles: The Martian Episodes &quot; with some editions with three episodes and others with five.

===Comic books===
Several of the short stories in &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; were adapted into graphic novel-style stories in the EC Comics magazines, including &quot;There Will Come Soft Rains&quot; in &quot;Weird Fantasy&quot; #17, &quot;The Long Years&quot; in &quot;Weird Science&quot; #17, &quot;Mars Is Heaven&quot; in &quot;Weird Science&quot; #18, &quot;The Million-Year Picnic&quot; in &quot;Weird Fantasy&quot; #21 and &quot;The Silent Towns&quot; in &quot;Weird Fantasy&quot; #22.

In 2011, Hill &amp; Wang published &quot;Ray Bradbury&#x27;s The Martian Chronicles: The Authorized Adaptation&quot; as a graphic novel, with art by Dennis Calero.

===Video games===
&quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; adventure game was published in 1996.

<text>The Aeneid ( ; or ) is a Latin epic poem that tells the legendary story of Aeneas, a Trojan who fled the fall of Troy and travelled to Italy, where he became the ancestor of the Romans. Written by the Roman poet Virgil between 29 and 19 BC, the &quot;Aeneid&quot; comprises 9,896 lines in dactylic hexameter. The first six of the poem&#x27;s twelve books tell the story of Aeneas&#x27; wanderings from Troy to Italy, and the poem&#x27;s second half tells of the Trojans&#x27; ultimately victorious war upon the Latins, under whose name Aeneas and his Trojan followers are destined to be subsumed.

The hero Aeneas was already known to Greco-Roman legend and myth, having been a character in the &quot;Iliad&quot;. Virgil took the disconnected tales of Aeneas&#x27; wanderings, his vague association with the foundation of Rome and his description as a personage of no fixed characteristics other than a scrupulous &quot;pietas&quot;, and fashioned the &quot;Aeneid&quot; into a compelling founding myth or national epic that tied Rome to the legends of Troy, explained the Punic Wars, glorified traditional Roman virtues, and legitimised the Julio-Claudian dynasty as descendants of the founders, heroes, and gods of Rome and Troy.

The &quot;Aeneid&quot; is widely regarded as Virgil&#x27;s masterpiece and one of the greatest works of Latin literature.

== Mythology and origins ==
Although the definitive story of Aeneas escaping the fallen Troy and finding a new home in Italy, thus eventually becoming the ancestor of the Romans, was codified by Virgil, the myth of Aeneas&#x27; post-Troy adventures predates him by centuries. As Greek settlements began to expand starting in the sixth century BC, Greek colonists would often try to connect their new homes, and the native people they found there, to their pre-existing mythology; the &quot;Odyssey&quot; containing Odysseus&#x27;s travels in many far away lands already provided such a link. Aeneas&#x27;s story reflects not just Roman, but rather a combination of various Greek, Etruscan, Latin and Roman elements. Troy provided for a very suitable narrative for the Greek colonists in Magna Graecia and Sicily who wished to link their new homelands with themselves, and the Etruscans, who would have adopted the story of Aeneas in Italy first, and quickly became associated with him.

Greek vases as early as the sixth century BC provide evidence for these early Greek mythological accounts of Aeneas founding a new home in Etruria predating Virgil by a wide margin, and he was known to have been worshipped in Lavinium, the city he founded. The discovery of thirteen large altars in Lavinium indicates early Greek influence, dating to the sixth through fourth century BC. In the following centuries, the Romans would come in contact with Greek colonies, conquer them and subsume the legend of Aeneas into their own mythological narratives. It is most likely that they fully became interested in Greek myths—and their incorporation into their own foundation legends concerning Rome and the Roman people—following the war against King Pyrrhus of Epirus in 280 BC, as Troy offered a way to insert Rome into Greek historical tradition as good as the one it had in the past for Greeks to link themselves to their new lands.

Literary evidence of a pre-Virgil attestation of Aeneas&#x27; journey can also be found. A fragment usually attributed to fifth-century BC logographer Hellanicus of Lesbos&#x27; lost &quot;History of the Priestesses of Argos&quot; states that Rome was founded by Aeneas with the help of Odysseus and named after Rhome, a Trojan woman Aeneas was acquainted with. The attribution of this passage to Hellanicus has been met with some doubt and rejection, but other scholars are less dismissive. Around the fourth century BC, an otherwise unknown Alcimus apparently made Aeneas the father of Romulus by Thyrrenia. Romulus&#x27; then grandson Rhomus (Remus) went on to found Rome.

== Story ==
The &quot;Aeneid&quot; can be divided into halves based on the disparate subject matter of Books 1–6 (Aeneas&#x27; journey to Latium in Italy), commonly associated with Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, and Books 7–12 (the war in Latium), mirroring the &quot;Iliad&quot;. These two halves are commonly regarded as reflecting Virgil&#x27;s ambition to rival Homer by treating both the &quot;Odyssey&quot;″s wandering theme and the &quot;Iliad&quot;″s warfare themes. This is, however, a rough correspondence, the limitations of which should be borne in mind.

===Journey to Italy (books 1–6)===
====Theme====
Virgil begins his poem with a statement of his theme (&quot; ...&quot;, &quot;Of arms and the man I sing ...&quot;) and an invocation to the Muse, falling some seven lines after the poem&#x27;s inception (&quot; ...&quot;, &quot;O Muse, recount to me the causes ...&quot;). He then explains the reason for the principal conflict in the story: the resentment held by the goddess Juno against the Trojan people. This is consistent with her role throughout the Homeric epics.

====Book 1: Storm and refuge====
Also in the manner of Homer, the story proper begins &quot;in medias res&quot; (into the middle of things), with the Trojan fleet in the eastern Mediterranean, heading in the direction of Italy. The fleet, led by Aeneas, is on a voyage to find a second home. It has been foretold that in Italy he will give rise to a race both noble and courageous, a race which will become known to all nations. Juno is wrathful, because she had not been chosen in the judgement of Paris, and because her favourite city, Carthage, will be destroyed by Aeneas&#x27; descendants. Also, Ganymede, a Trojan prince, was chosen to be the cupbearer to her husband, Jupiter—replacing Juno&#x27;s daughter, Hebe. Juno proceeds to Aeolus, King of the Winds, and asks that he release the winds to stir up a storm in exchange for a bribe (Deiopea, the loveliest of all her sea nymphs, as a wife). Aeolus agrees to carry out Juno&#x27;s orders (line 77, &quot;My task is / To fulfill your commands&quot;); the storm then devastates the fleet.
Neptune takes notice: although he himself is no friend of the Trojans, he is infuriated by Juno&#x27;s intrusion into his domain, and stills the winds and calms the waters, after making sure that the winds would not bother the Trojans again, lest they be punished more harshly than they were this time. The fleet takes shelter on the coast of Africa, where Aeneas rouses the spirits of his men, reassuring them that they have been through worse situations before. There, Aeneas&#x27; mother, Venus, in the form of a huntress very similar to the goddess Diana, encourages him and recounts to him the history of Carthage. Eventually, Aeneas ventures into the city, and in the temple of Juno he seeks and gains the favour of Dido, queen of the city. The city has only recently been founded by refugees from Tyre and will later become a great imperial rival and enemy to Rome.

Meanwhile, Venus has her own plans. She goes to her son, Aeneas&#x27; half-brother Cupid, and tells him to imitate Ascanius (the son of Aeneas and his first wife Creusa). Thus disguised, Cupid goes to Dido and offers the gifts expected from a guest. As Dido cradles the boy during a banquet given in honour of the Trojans, Cupid secretly weakens her sworn fidelity to the soul of her late husband Sychaeus, who was murdered by her brother Pygmalion back in Tyre, by inciting fresh love for Aeneas.

====Book 2: Trojan Horse and sack of Troy====

In books 2 and 3, Aeneas recounts to Dido the events that occasioned the Trojans&#x27; arrival. He begins the tale shortly after the war described in the &quot;Iliad&quot;. Cunning Ulysses devised a way for Greek warriors to gain entry into the walled city of Troy by hiding in a large wooden horse. The Greeks pretended to sail away, leaving a warrior, Sinon, to mislead the Trojans into believing that the horse was an offering and that if it were taken into the city, the Trojans would be able to conquer Greece. The Trojan priest Laocoön saw through the Greek plot and urged the horse&#x27;s destruction, but his protests fell on deaf ears, so he hurled his spear at the horse. Then, in what would be seen by the Trojans as punishment from the gods, two serpents emerged from the sea and devoured Laocoön, along with his two sons. The Trojans then took the horse inside the fortified walls, and after nightfall the armed Greeks emerged from it, opening the city&#x27;s gates to allow the returned Greek army to slaughter the Trojans.

In a dream, Hector, the fallen Trojan prince, advised Aeneas to flee with his family. Aeneas awoke and saw with horror what was happening to his beloved city. At first he tried to fight the enemy, but soon he lost his comrades and was left alone to fend off the Greeks. He witnessed the murder of Priam by Achilles&#x27; son Pyrrhus. His mother, Venus, appeared to him and led him back to his house. Aeneas tells of his escape with his son, Ascanius, his wife Creusa, and his father, Anchises, after the occurrence of various omens (Ascanius&#x27; head catching fire without his being harmed, a clap of thunder and a shooting star). At the city gates, they notice that they have lost Creusa, and Aeneas has to re-enter the city in order to look for her. To his sorrow, he encounters only her ghost, who tells him that his destiny is to reach Hesperia, where kingship and a royal spouse await him.

====Book 3: Wanderings====
Aeneas continues his account to Dido by telling how, rallying the other survivors, he built a fleet of ships and made landfall at various locations in the Mediterranean: Thrace, where they find the last remains of a fellow Trojan, Polydorus; Delos, where Apollo tells them to leave and to find the land of their forefathers; Crete, which they believe to be that land, and where they build their city (Pergamea) and promptly desert it after a plague proves this is not the place for them; the Strophades, where they encounter the Harpy Celaeno, who tells them to leave her island and to look for Italy, though, she prophesies, they will not find it until hunger forces them to eat their tables; and Buthrotum. This last city had been built in an attempt to replicate Troy. In Buthrotum, Aeneas meets Andromache, the widow of Hector. She is still lamenting the loss of her valiant husband and beloved child. There, too, Aeneas sees and meets Helenus, one of Priam&#x27;s sons, who has the gift of prophecy. Through him, Aeneas learns the destiny laid out for him: he is divinely advised to seek out the land of Italy (also known as &quot;Ausonia&quot; or &quot;Hesperia&quot;), where his descendants will not only prosper, but in time rule the entire known world. In addition, Helenus also bids him to go to the Sibyl in Cumae.

Heading into the open sea, Aeneas leaves Buthrotum, rounds the south eastern tip of Italy and makes his way towards Sicily (Trinacria). There, they are caught in the whirlpool of Charybdis and driven out to sea. Soon they come ashore at the land of the Cyclopes. There they meet a Greek, Achaemenides, one of Ulysses&#x27; men, who has been left behind when his comrades escaped the cave of Polyphemus. They take Achaemenides on board and narrowly escape Polyphemus. Shortly after, at Drepanum, Aeneas&#x27; father Anchises dies of old age. Aeneas heads on (towards Italy) and gets deflected to Carthage (by the storm described in book 1). Here, Aeneas ends his account of his wanderings to Dido.

====Book 4: Fate of Queen Dido====
Dido realises that she has fallen in love with Aeneas. Juno seizes upon this opportunity to make a deal with Venus, Aeneas&#x27; mother, with the intention of distracting Aeneas from his destiny of founding a city in Italy. Aeneas is inclined to return Dido&#x27;s love, and during a hunting expedition, a storm drives them into a small cave in which Aeneas and Dido make love, after which Juno presides over what Dido considers a marriage ceremony.

Fama (the personification of rumour) spreads the news of Aeneas and Dido&#x27;s marriage, which eventually reaches king Iarbas. Iarbas, who also sought relations with Dido but was rejected, angrily prays to his father Jupiter to express his feeling that his worship of Jupiter has not earned him the rewards he deserves. As a result, Jupiter sends Mercury to remind Aeneas of his duty, leaving him no choice but to depart.

When Aeneas clandestinely begins making preparations to leave at the behest of Mercury, Dido discovers Aeneas&#x27; intentions. Enraged and heartbroken, she accuses Aeneas of infidelity while also imploring him to stay. Aeneas responds by attempting to explain that his duty is important and that he does not leave of his own volition, but Dido is not satisfied. Ultimately, her heart broken, Dido commits suicide by stabbing herself upon a pyre with Aeneas&#x27; sword. Before dying, she predicts eternal strife between Aeneas&#x27; people and hers; &quot;rise up from my bones, avenging spirit&quot; (4.625, trans. Fitzgerald) is a possible invocation to Hannibal.

====Book 5: Sicily====
Looking back from the deck of his ship, Aeneas sees the smoke of Dido&#x27;s funeral pyre, and although he does not understand the exact reason behind it, he understands it as a bad omen, considering the angry madness of her love.
Hindered by bad weather from reaching Italy, the Trojans return to where they started at the beginning of book 1. Book 5 then takes place on Sicily and centres on the funeral games that Aeneas organises for the anniversary of his father&#x27;s death. Aeneas organises celebratory games for the men—a boat race, a foot race, a boxing match, and an archery contest. In all those contests, Aeneas is careful to reward winners and losers, showing his leadership qualities by not allowing antagonism even after foul play. Each of these contests comments on past events or prefigures future events: the boxing match, for instance, is &quot;a preview of the final encounter of Aeneas and Turnus&quot;, and the dove, the target during the archery contest, is connected to the deaths of Polites and King Priam in Book 2 and that of Camilla in Book 11. Afterwards, Ascanius leads the boys in a military parade and mock battle, the Lusus Troiae—a tradition he will teach the Latins while building the walls of Alba Longa.

During these events, Juno, via her messenger Iris, who disguises herself as an old woman, incites the Trojan women to burn the fleet and prevent the Trojans from ever reaching Italy, but her plan is thwarted when Ascanius and Aeneas intervene. Aeneas prays to Jupiter to quench the fires, which the god does with a torrential rainstorm. An anxious Aeneas is comforted by a vision of his father, who tells him to go to the underworld to receive a vision of his and Rome&#x27;s future. In return for safe passage to Italy, the gods, by order of Jupiter, will receive one of Aeneas&#x27; men as a sacrifice: Palinurus, who steers Aeneas&#x27; ship by night, is put to sleep by Somnus and falls overboard.

====Book 6: Underworld====

Aeneas, with the guidance of the Cumaean Sibyl, descends into the underworld. They pass by crowds of the dead by the banks of the river Acheron and are ferried across by Charon before passing by Cerberus, the three-headed guardian of the underworld. Then Aeneas is shown the fates of the wicked in Tartarus and is warned by the Sibyl to bow to the justice of the gods. He also meets the shade of Dido, who remains irreconcilable. He is then brought to green fields of Elysium. There he speaks with the spirit of his father and is offered a prophetic vision of the destiny of Rome.

===War in Italy (books 7–12)===
==== Book 7: Arrival in Latium and outbreak of war ====
Upon returning to the land of the living, Aeneas leads the Trojans to settle in Latium, where King Latinus received oracles pointing towards the arrival of strangers and bidding him to marry his daughter Lavinia to the foreigners, and not to Turnus, the ruler of another native people, the Rutuli. Juno, unhappy with the Trojans&#x27; favourable situation, summons the fury Alecto from the underworld to stir up a war between the Trojans and the locals. Alecto incites Amata, the Queen of Latium and the wife of Latinus, to demand that Lavinia be married to noble Turnus, brings forth anger in Turnus which spurs him to war with the Trojans, and causes Ascanius to wound a revered deer during a hunt. Hence, although Aeneas wishes to avoid a war, hostilities break out. The book closes with a catalogue of Italic warriors.

==== Book 8: Visit to Pallanteum, site of future Rome ====

Given the impending war, Aeneas seeks help from the Tuscans, enemies of the Rutuli, after having been encouraged to do so in a dream by Tiberinus. At the place where Rome will be, he meets a friendly Greek, King Evander of Arcadia. His son Pallas agrees to join Aeneas and lead troops against the Rutuli. Venus urges her spouse Vulcan to create weapons for Aeneas, which she then presents to Aeneas as a gift. On the shield, the future history of Rome is depicted.

==== Book 9: Turnus&#x27; siege of Trojan camp ====
Meanwhile, the Trojan camp is attacked by Turnus—spurred on by Juno, who informs him that Aeneas is away from his camp—and a midnight raid by the Trojans Nisus and Euryalus on Turnus&#x27; camp leads to their death. The next day, Turnus manages to breach the gates but is forced to retreat by jumping into the Tiber.

==== Book 10: First battle ====
A council of the gods is held, in which Venus and Juno speak before Jupiter, and Aeneas returns to the besieged Trojan camp accompanied by his new Arcadian and Tuscan allies. In the ensuing battle many are slain—notably Pallas, whom Evander has entrusted to Aeneas but who is killed by Turnus. Mezentius, Turnus&#x27; close associate, allows his son Lausus to be killed by Aeneas while he himself flees. He reproaches himself and faces Aeneas in single combat—an honourable but essentially futile endeavour leading to his death.

==== Book 11: Armistice and battle with Camilla ====
After a short break in which the funeral ceremony for Pallas takes place, the war continues. Another notable native, Camilla, an Amazon character and virgin devoted to Diana, fights bravely but is killed, poisoned by the coward Arruns, who in turn is struck dead by Diana&#x27;s sentinel Opis.

==== Book 12: Final battle and duel of Aeneas and Turnus ====
Single combat is proposed between Aeneas and Turnus, but Aeneas is so obviously superior to Turnus that the Rutuli, urged on by Turnus&#x27; divine sister, Juturna—who in turn is instigated by Juno—break the truce. Aeneas is injured by an arrow but is soon healed with the help of his mother Venus and returns to the battle. Turnus and Aeneas dominate the battle on opposite wings, but when Aeneas makes a daring attack at the city of Latium (causing the queen of Latium to hang herself in despair), he forces Turnus into single combat once more. In the duel, Turnus&#x27; strength deserts him as he tries to hurl a rock, and Aeneas&#x27; spear goes through his thigh. As Turnus is on his knees, begging for his life, the epic ends with Aeneas initially tempted to obey Turnus&#x27; pleas to spare his life, but then killing him in rage when he sees that Turnus is wearing Aeneas&#x27; friend Pallas&#x27; belt over his shoulder as a trophy.
==Reception==

Critics of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; focus on a variety of issues. The tone of the poem as a whole is a particular matter of debate; some see the poem as ultimately pessimistic and politically subversive to the Augustan regime, while others view it as a celebration of the new imperial dynasty. Virgil makes use of the symbolism of the Augustan regime, and some scholars see strong associations between Augustus and Aeneas, the one as founder and the other as re-founder of Rome. A strong teleology, or drive towards a climax, has been detected in the poem. The &quot;Aeneid&quot; is full of prophecies about the future of Rome, the deeds of Augustus, his ancestors, and famous Romans, and the Carthaginian Wars; the shield of Aeneas even depicts Augustus&#x27; victory at Actium in 31 BC. A further focus of study is the character of Aeneas. As the protagonist of the poem, Aeneas seems to constantly waver between his emotions and commitment to his prophetic duty to found Rome; critics note the breakdown of Aeneas&#x27; emotional control in the last sections of the poem where the &quot;pious&quot; and &quot;righteous&quot; Aeneas mercilessly slaughters the Latin warrior Turnus.

The &quot;Aeneid&quot; appears to have been a great success. Virgil is said to have recited Books 2, 4 and 6 to Augustus; the mention of her son, Marcellus, in book 6 apparently caused Augustus&#x27; sister Octavia to faint. The poem was unfinished when Virgil died in 19 BC.

==Virgil&#x27;s death, and editing==

According to tradition, Virgil traveled to Greece around 19 BC to revise the &quot;Aeneid&quot;. After meeting Augustus in Athens and deciding to return home, Virgil caught a fever while visiting a town near Megara. Virgil crossed to Italy by ship, weakened with disease, and died in Brundisium harbour on 21 September 19 BC, leaving a wish that the manuscript of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; was to be burned. Augustus ordered Virgil&#x27;s literary executors, Lucius Varius Rufus and Plotius Tucca, to disregard that wish, instead ordering the &quot;Aeneid&quot; to be published with as few editorial changes as possible. As a result, the existing text of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; may contain faults which Virgil was planning to correct before publication. However, the only obvious imperfections are a few lines of verse that are metrically unfinished (i.e., not a complete line of dactylic hexameter). Other alleged &quot;imperfections&quot; are subject to scholarly debate.

==History==

The &quot;Aeneid&quot; was written in a time of major political and social change in Rome, with the fall of the Roman Republic and the Final War of the Roman Republic having torn through society and many Romans&#x27; faith in the &quot;Greatness of Rome&quot; severely faltering. However, the new emperor, Augustus Caesar, began to institute a new era of prosperity and peace, specifically through the re-introduction of traditional Roman moral values. The &quot;Aeneid&quot; was seen as reflecting this aim, by depicting the heroic Aeneas as a man devoted and loyal to his country and its prominence, rather than his own personal gains. In addition, the &quot;Aeneid&quot; gives mythic legitimisation to the rule of Julius Caesar and, by extension, to his adopted son Augustus, by immortalising the tradition that renamed Aeneas&#x27; son, Ascanius (called Ilus from &quot;Ilium&quot;, meaning Troy), &quot;Iulus&quot;, thus making him an ancestor of the &quot;gens Julia&quot;, the family of Julius Caesar, and many other great imperial descendants as part of the prophecy given to him in the Underworld. (The meter shows that the name &quot;Iulus&quot; is pronounced as three syllables, not as &quot;Julus&quot;.)

The perceived deficiency of any account of Aeneas&#x27; marriage to Lavinia or his founding of the Roman race led some writers, such as the 15th-century Italian poet Maffeo Vegio (through his &quot;Thirteenth Book of the Aeneid&quot; widely printed in the Renaissance), Pier Candido Decembrio (whose attempt was never completed), Claudio Salvucci (in his 1994 epic poem &quot;The Laviniad&quot;), and Ursula K. Le Guin (in her 2008 novel &quot;Lavinia&quot;) to compose their own supplements.

Despite the polished and complex nature of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; (legend stating that Virgil wrote only three lines of the poem each day), the number of half-complete lines and the abrupt ending are generally seen as evidence that Virgil died before he could finish the work. Some legends state that Virgil, fearing that he would die before he had properly revised the poem, gave instructions to friends (including the current emperor, Augustus) that the &quot;Aeneid&quot; should be burned upon his death, owing to its unfinished state and because he had come to dislike one of the sequences in Book VIII, in which Venus and Vulcan made love, for its nonconformity to Roman moral virtues. The friends did not comply with Virgil&#x27;s wishes and Augustus himself ordered that they be disregarded. After minor modifications, the &quot;Aeneid&quot; was published. Because it was composed and preserved in writing rather than orally, the text exhibits less variation than other classical epics.

==Style==
As with other classical Latin poetry, the meter is based on the length of syllables rather than the stress, though the interplay of meter and stress is also important. Virgil also incorporated such poetic devices as alliteration, onomatopoeia, synecdoche, and assonance. Furthermore, he uses personification, metaphor, and simile in his work, usually to add drama and tension to the scene. An example of a simile can be found in book II when Aeneas is compared to a shepherd who stood on the high top of a rock unaware of what is going on around him. It can be seen that just as the shepherd is a protector of his sheep, so too is Aeneas to his people.

As was the rule in classical antiquity, an author&#x27;s style was seen as an expression of his personality and character. Virgil&#x27;s Latin has been praised for its evenness, subtlety and dignity.

===Structure===
The &quot;Aeneid&quot;, like other classical epics, is written in dactylic hexameters: each line consists of six metrical feet made up of dactyls (one long syllable followed by two short syllables) and spondees (two long syllables). This epic consists of twelve books, and the narrative is broken up into three sections of four books each, respectively addressing Dido; the Trojans&#x27; arrival in Italy; and the war with the Latins. Each book has roughly 700–900 lines. The &quot;Aeneid&quot; comes to an abrupt ending, and scholars have speculated that Virgil died before he could finish the poem.

==Themes==

===&quot;Pietas&quot;===
The Roman ideal of &quot;pietas&quot; (&quot;piety, dutiful respect&quot;), which can be loosely translated from the Latin as a selfless sense of duty toward one&#x27;s
filial, religious, and societal obligations, was a crux of ancient Roman morality. Throughout the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Aeneas serves as the embodiment of
&quot;pietas&quot;, with the phrase &quot;pious Aeneas&quot; occurring 20 times throughout the poem, thereby fulfilling his capacity as the father of the Roman people.
For instance, in Book 2 Aeneas describes how he carried his father Anchises from the burning city of Troy: &quot;No help/ Or hope of help existed./
So I resigned myself, picked up my father,/ And turned my face toward the mountain range.&quot; Furthermore, Aeneas ventures into the underworld, thereby fulfilling Anchises&#x27; wishes. His father&#x27;s gratitude is presented in the text by the following lines: &quot;Have you at last come, has that loyalty/ Your father counted on conquered the journey?&quot;

However, Aeneas&#x27; &quot;pietas&quot; extends beyond his devotion to his father: we also see several examples of his religious fervour. Aeneas is consistently subservient to the gods, even in actions opposed to his own desires, as he responds to one such divine command, &quot;I sail to Italy not of my own free will.&quot;

In addition to his religious and familial &quot;pietas&quot;, Aeneas also displays fervent patriotism and devotion to his people, particularly in a military capacity. For instance, as he and his followers leave Troy, Aeneas swears that he will &quot;take up/ The combat once again. We shall not all/ Die this day unavenged.&quot;

Aeneas is a symbol of &quot;pietas&quot; in all of its forms, serving as a moral paragon to whom a Roman should aspire.

===Divine intervention===
One of the most recurring themes in the &quot;Aeneid&quot; is that of divine intervention. Throughout the poem, the gods are constantly influencing the main characters and trying to change and impact the outcome, regardless of the fate that they all know will occur. For example, Juno comes down and acts as a phantom Aeneas to drive Turnus away from the real Aeneas and all of his rage from the death of Pallas. Even though Juno knows in the end that Aeneas will triumph over Turnus, she does all she can to delay and avoid this outcome.

Divine intervention occurs multiple times, in Book 4 especially. Aeneas falls in love with Dido, delaying his ultimate fate of travelling to Italy. However, it is actually the gods who inspired the love, as Juno plots:
Dido and the Trojan captain [will come]
To one same cavern. I shall be on hand,
And if I can be certain you are willing,
There I shall marry them and call her his.
A wedding, this will be.
Juno is speaking to Venus, making an agreement and influencing the lives and emotions of both Dido and Aeneas. Later in the same book, Jupiter steps in and restores what is the true fate and path for Aeneas, sending Mercury down to Aeneas&#x27; dreams, telling him that he must travel to Italy and leave his new-found lover. As Aeneas later pleads with Dido:
The gods&#x27; interpreter, sent by Jove himself –
I swear it by your head and mine – has brought
Commands down through the racing winds!...
I sail for Italy not of my own free will.
Several of the gods try to intervene against the powers of fate, even though they know what the eventual outcome will be. The interventions are really just distractions to continue the conflict and postpone the inevitable. If the gods represent humans, just as the human characters engage in conflicts and power struggles, so too do the gods.

===Fate===
Fate, described as a preordained destiny that men and gods have to follow, is a major theme in the &quot;Aeneid&quot;. One example is when Aeneas is reminded of his fate through Jupiter and Mercury while he is falling in love with Dido. Mercury urges, &quot;Think of your expectations of your heir,/ Iulus, to whom the whole Italian realm, the land/ Of Rome, are due.&quot; Mercury is referring to Aeneas&#x27; preordained fate to found Rome, as well as Rome&#x27;s preordained fate to rule the world:
He was to be ruler of Italy,
Potential empire, armorer of war;
To father men from Teucer&#x27;s noble blood
And bring the whole world under law&#x27;s dominion.
It is important to recognise that there is a marked difference between fate and divine intervention, as even though the gods might remind mortals of their eventual fate, the gods themselves are not in control of it. For example, the opening lines of the poem specify that Aeneas &quot;came to Italy by destiny&quot;, but is also harassed by the separate force of &quot;baleful Juno in her sleepless rage&quot;. Even though Juno might intervene, Aeneas&#x27; fate is set in stone and cannot be changed.

Later in Book 6, when Aeneas visits the underworld, his father Anchises introduces him to the larger fate of the Roman people, as contrasted against his own personal fate to found Rome:
So raptly, everywhere, father and son
Wandered the airy plain and viewed it all.
After Anchises had conducted him
To every region and had fired his love
Of glory in the years to come, he spoke
Of wars that he might fight, of Laurentines,
And of Latinus&#x27; city, then of how
He might avoid or bear each toil to come.
===Violence and conflict===
From the very beginning of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, violence and conflict are used as a means of survival and conquest. Aeneas&#x27; voyage is caused by the Trojan War and the destruction of
Troy. Aeneas describes to Dido in Book 2 the massive amount of destruction that occurs after the Greeks sneak into Troy. He recalls that he asks his men to &quot;defend/ A city
lost in flames. Come, let us die,/ We&#x27;ll make a rush into the thick of it.&quot;
This is one of the first demonstrations of the way in which violence begets violence: even though the Trojans know they have lost the battle, they continue to fight for their country.

This violence continues as Aeneas makes his journey. Dido kills herself in order to end and escape her worldly problem: being heartbroken over the departure of Aeneas and now left alone, surrounded by violent rulers who desire her and her throne. Queen Dido&#x27;s suicide is a double edged sword. While releasing herself from the burden of her pain through violence, her last words
implore her people to view Aeneas&#x27; people with hate for all eternity:
This is my last cry, as my last blood flows.
Then, O my Tyrians, besiege with hate
His progeny and all his race to come:
Make this your offering to my dust. No love,
No pact must be between our peoples.
Furthermore, her people, hearing of their queen&#x27;s death, have only one avenue on which to direct the blame: the already-departed Trojans. Thus, Dido&#x27;s request of her people
and her people&#x27;s only recourse for closure align in their mutual hate for Aeneas and his Trojans. In effect, Dido&#x27;s violent suicide leads to the violent nature of the
later relationship between Carthage and Rome.

Finally, when Aeneas arrives in Latium, conflict inevitably arises. Juno sends Alecto, one of the Furies, to cause Turnus to go against Aeneas. In the ensuing battles, Turnus
kills Pallas, who is supposed to be under Aeneas&#x27; protection. This act of violence causes Aeneas to be consumed with fury. Although Turnus asks for mercy in their final encounter,
when Aeneas sees that Turnus has taken Pallas&#x27; sword belt, Aeneas proclaims:
You in your plunder, torn from one of mine,
Shall I be robbed of you? This wound will come
From Pallas: Pallas makes this offering
And from your criminal blood exacts his due.
This final act of violence shows how Turnus&#x27; violence—the act of killing Pallas—inevitably leads to more violence and his own death.

It is possible that the recurring theme of violence in the &quot;Aeneid&quot; is a subtle commentary on the bloody violence contemporary readers would have just experienced during the Late Republican
civil wars. The &quot;Aeneid&quot; potentially explores whether the violence of the civil wars was necessary to establish a lasting peace under Augustus, or whether it would just lead to more violence in the future.

===Propaganda===

Written during the reign of Augustus, the &quot;Aeneid&quot; presents the hero Aeneas as a strong and powerful leader. The favourable representation of Aeneas parallels
Augustus in that it portrays his reign in a progressive and admirable light, and allows Augustus to be positively associated with the portrayal of Aeneas.
Although Virgil&#x27;s patron Maecenas was obviously not Augustus himself, he was still a high figure within Augustus&#x27; administration and could have personally
benefitted from representing Aeneas in a positive light.

In the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Aeneas is portrayed as the singular hope for the rebirth of the Trojan people. Charged with the preservation of his people by divine authority, Aeneas is symbolic of Augustus&#x27; own accomplishments in establishing order after the long period of chaos of the Roman civil wars. Augustus as the light of savior and the last
hope of the Roman people is a parallel to Aeneas as the savior of the Trojans. This parallel functions as propaganda in support of Augustus, as it depicts the Trojan people,
future Romans themselves, as uniting behind a single leader who will lead them out of ruin:
New refugees in a great crowd: men and women
Gathered for exile, young-pitiful people
Coming from every quarter, minds made up,
With their belongings, for whatever lands
I&#x27;d lead them to by sea.
Later in Book 6, Aeneas travels to the underworld where he sees his father Anchises, who tells him of his own destiny as well as that of
the Roman people. Anchises describes how Aeneas&#x27; descendant Romulus will found the great city of Rome,
which will eventually be ruled by Caesar Augustus:
Turn your two eyes
This way and see this people, your own Romans.
Here is Caesar, and all the line of Iulus,
All who shall one day pass under the dome
Of the great sky: this is the man, this one,
Of whom so often you have heard the promise,
Caesar Augustus, son of the deified,
Who shall bring once again an Age of Gold
To Latium, to the land where Saturn reigned
In early times.
Virgil writes about the fated future of Lavinium, the city that Aeneas will found, which will in turn lead directly to the
golden reign of Augustus. Virgil is using a form of literary propaganda to demonstrate the Augustan
regime&#x27;s destiny to bring glory and peace to Rome. Rather than use Aeneas indirectly as a positive parallel
to Augustus as in other parts of the poem, Virgil outright praises the emperor in Book 6, referring to Augustus as a harbinger for the glory
of Rome and new levels of prosperity.

==Allegory==
The poem abounds with smaller and greater allegories. Two of the debated allegorical sections pertain to the exit from the underworld and to Pallas&#x27; belt.

Aeneas&#x27; leaving the underworld through the gate of false dreams has been variously interpreted: one suggestion is that the passage simply refers to the time of day at which Aeneas returned to the world of the living; another is that it implies that all of Aeneas&#x27; actions in the remainder of the poem are somehow &quot;false&quot;. In an extension of the latter interpretation, it has been suggested that Virgil is conveying that the history of the world since the foundation of Rome is but a lie. Other scholars claim that Virgil is establishing that the theological implications of the preceding scene (an apparent system of reincarnation) are not to be taken as literal.

The second section in question is

This section has been interpreted to mean that for the entire passage of the poem, Aeneas, who symbolises &quot;pietas&quot; (piety or morality), in a moment becomes &quot;furor&quot; (fury), thus destroying what is essentially the primary theme of the poem itself. Many have argued over these two sections. Some claim that Virgil meant to change them before he died, while others find that the location of the two passages, at the very end of the so-called Volume I (Books 1–6, the &quot;Odyssey&quot;), and Volume II (Books 7–12, the &quot;Iliad&quot;), and their short length, which contrasts with the lengthy nature of the poem, are evidence that Virgil placed them purposefully there.

==Influence==

The &quot;Aeneid&quot; is a cornerstone of the Western canon, and early (at least by the 2nd century AD) became one of the essential elements of a Latin education, usually required to be memorised. Even after the decline of the Roman Empire, it &quot;remained central to a Latin education&quot;. In Latin-Christian culture, the &quot;Aeneid&quot; was one of the canonical texts, subjected to commentary as a philological and educational study, with the most complete commentary having been written by the 4th-century grammarian Maurus Servius Honoratus. It was widely held to be the pinnacle of Latin literature, much in the same way that the &quot;Iliad&quot; was seen to be supreme in Greek literature.

The strong influence of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; has been identified in the development of European vernacular literatures—some English works that show its influence being &quot;Beowulf&quot;, Layamon&#x27;s &quot;Brut&quot; (through the source text &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;), &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, and Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. The Italian poet Dante Alighieri was himself profoundly influenced by the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, so much so that his magnum opus &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;, itself widely considered central to the western canon, includes a number of quotations from and allusions to the &quot;Aeneid&quot; and features the author Virgil as a major character—the guide of Dante through the realms of the Inferno and Purgatorio. Another continental work displaying the influence of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; is the 16th-century Portuguese epic &quot;Os Lusíadas&quot;, written by Luís de Camões and dealing with Vasco da Gama&#x27;s voyage to India.

The importance of Latin education itself was paramount in Western culture: &quot;from 1600 to 1900, the Latin school was at the centre of European education, wherever it was found&quot;; within that Latin school, Virgil was taught at the advanced level and, in 19th-century England, special editions of Virgil were awarded to students who distinguished themselves. In the United States, Virgil and specifically the &quot;Aeneid&quot; were taught in the fourth year of a Latin sequence, at least until the 1960s; the current (2011) Advanced Placement curriculum in Latin continues to assign a central position to the poem: &quot;The AP Latin: Virgil Exam is designed to test the student&#x27;s ability to read, translate, understand, analyze, and interpret the lines of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; that appear on the course syllabus in Latin.&quot;

Many phrases from this poem entered the Latin language, much as passages from Shakespeare and Alexander Pope have entered the English language. One example is from Aeneas&#x27; reaction to a painting of the sack of Troy: &quot;Sunt lacrimae rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt&quot;—&quot;These are the tears of things, and our mortality cuts to the heart&quot; (&quot;Aeneid&quot; I, 462). The influence is also visible in very modern work: Brian Friel&#x27;s &quot;Translations&quot; (a play written in the 1980s, set in 19th-century Ireland), makes references to the classics throughout and ends with a passage from the &quot;Aeneid&quot;:
&quot;Urbs antiqua fuit&quot;—there was an ancient city which, &#x27;tis said, Juno loved above all the lands. And it was the goddess&#x27; aim and cherished hope that here should be the capital of all nations—should the fates perchance allow that. Yet in truth she discovered that a race was springing from Trojan blood to overthrow some day these Tyrian towers—a people &quot;late regem belloque superbum&quot;—kings of broad realms and proud in war who would come forth for Libya&#x27;s downfall.

== English translations ==
The first full and faithful rendering of the poem in an Anglic language is the Scots translation by Gavin Douglas—his &quot;Eneados&quot;, completed in 1513, which also included Maffeo Vegio&#x27;s supplement. Even in the 20th century, Ezra Pound considered this still to be the best &quot;Aeneid&quot; translation, praising the &quot;richness and fervour&quot; of its language and its hallmark fidelity to the original. The English translation by the 17th-century poet John Dryden is another important version. Most classic translations, including both Douglas and Dryden, employ a rhyme scheme; most more modern attempts do not.

Recent English verse translations include those by Patric Dickinson (1961); British Poet Laureate Cecil Day-Lewis (1963), who strove to render Virgil&#x27;s original hexameter line; Allen Mandelbaum (honoured by a 1973 National Book Award); Library of Congress Poet Laureate Robert Fitzgerald (1981); David West (1990); Stanley Lombardo (2005); Robert Fagles (2006); Frederick Ahl (2007); Sarah Ruden (2008); Barry B. Powell (2015); David Ferry (2017); Len Krisak (2020); and Shadi Bartsch (2021). Fagles&#x27; translation was generally well received. On &quot;Bookmarks Magazine&quot; Mar/Apr 2007 issue, a magazine that aggregates critic reviews of books, the book received a (5.0 out of 5) based on critic reviews with the critical summary stating, &quot;&quot;The Aeneid&quot; will remain fresh for generations fortunate enough to be guided by Fagles’s talents&quot;.

There have also been partial translations, such as those by Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey (Book 2 and Book 4), and Seamus Heaney (Book 6).

== Adaptations ==

One of the first operas based on the story of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; was the English composer Henry Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; (1688). The opera is famous for its aria &quot;Dido&#x27;s Lament&quot; (&#x27;When I am laid in earth&#x27;), of which the first line of the melody is inscribed on the wall by the door of the Purcell Room, a concert hall in London.

The story of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; was made into the grand opera &quot;Les Troyens&quot; (1856–1858) by the French composer Hector Berlioz.

The &quot;Aeneid&quot; was the basis for the 1962 Italian film &quot;The Avenger&quot; and the 1971–1972 television serial &quot;Eneide&quot;.

In the musical &quot;Spring Awakening&quot;, based on the play of the same title by Frank Wedekind, schoolboys study the Latin text, and the first verse of Book 1 is incorporated into the number &quot;All That&#x27;s Known&quot;.

Ursula Le Guin&#x27;s 2008 novel &quot;Lavinia&quot; is a free prose retelling of the last six books of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; narrated by and centred on Aeneas&#x27; Latin wife Lavinia, a minor character in the epic poem. It carries the action forward to the crowning of Aeneas&#x27; younger son Silvius as king of Latium.

A 17th-century popular broadside ballad also appears to recount events from books 1–4 of the &quot;Aeneid,&quot; focusing mostly on the relationship between Aeneas and Dido. The ballad, &quot;The Wandering Prince of Troy&quot;, presents many similar elements as Virgil&#x27;s epic, but alters Dido&#x27;s final sentiments toward Aeneas, as well as presenting an interesting end for Aeneas himself.

===Parodies and travesties===
A number of parodies and travesties of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; have been made.

* One of the earliest was written in Italian by Giovanni Batista Lalli in 1635, titled &quot;L&#x27;Eneide travestita del Signor Gio&quot;.
* A French parody by Paul Scarron became famous in France in the mid-17th century, and spread rapidly through Europe, accompanying the growing French influence. Its influence was especially strong in Russia.
*Charles Cotton&#x27;s 17th-century work &quot;Scarronides&quot; included a travestied &quot;Aeneid&quot;.
* In 1791, the Russian poet N. P. Osipov published ().
* In 1798, &quot;Eneida&quot;, a Ukrainian mock-heroic burlesque poem, was written by Ivan Kotliarevsky. It is considered to be the first literary work published wholly in the modern Ukrainian language. Kotliarevsky&#x27;s epic poem was adapted into an animated feature film of the same name, in 1991, by Ukranimafilm.
* Some time between 1812 and the 1830s, the Belarusian poet Vikientsi Ravinski wrote the burlesque poem &quot;Eneida inside-out&quot; (). His work was inspired by the Russian and Ukrainian parodies.

<text>Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus (), commonly referred to as Suetonius ( ; – after AD 122), was a Roman historian who wrote during the early Imperial era of the Roman Empire. His most important surviving work is &quot;De vita Caesarum&quot;, commonly known in English as &quot;The Twelve Caesars&quot;, a set of biographies of 12 successive Roman rulers from Julius Caesar to Domitian. Other works by Suetonius concerned the daily life of Rome, politics, oratory, and the lives of famous writers, including poets, historians, and grammarians. A few of these books have partially survived, but many have been lost.

==Life==
Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus was probably born about AD 69, a date deduced from his remarks describing himself as a &quot;young man&quot; 20 years after Nero&#x27;s death. His place of birth is disputed, but most scholars place it in Hippo Regius, a small north African town in Numidia, in modern-day Algeria. It is certain that Suetonius came from a family of moderate social position, that his father, Suetonius Laetus, was a tribune belonging to the equestrian order (&quot;tribunus angusticlavius&quot;) in Legio XIII Gemina, and that Suetonius was educated when schools of rhetoric flourished in Rome.

Suetonius was a close friend of senator and letter-writer Pliny the Younger. Pliny describes him as &quot;quiet and studious, a man dedicated to writing&quot;. Pliny helped him buy a small property and interceded with the Emperor Trajan to grant Suetonius immunities usually granted to a father of three, the &quot;ius trium liberorum&quot;, because his marriage was childless. Through Pliny, Suetonius came into favour with Trajan and Hadrian. Suetonius may have served on Pliny&#x27;s staff when Pliny was imperial governor (&quot;legatus Augusti pro praetore&quot;) of Bithynia and Pontus (northern Asia Minor) between 110 and 112. Under Trajan he served as secretary of studies (precise functions are uncertain) and director of Imperial archives. Under Hadrian, he became the emperor&#x27;s secretary. Hadrian later dismissed Suetonius for his alleged affair with the empress Vibia Sabina.

==Works==
===The Twelve Caesars===

Suetonius is mainly remembered as the author of &quot;De Vita Caesarum&quot;—translated as &quot;The Life of the Caesars&quot;, although a more common English title is &quot;The Lives of the Twelve Caesars&quot; or simply &quot;The Twelve Caesars&quot;—his only extant work except for the brief biographies and other fragments noted below. &quot;The Twelve Caesars&quot;, probably written in Hadrian&#x27;s time, is a collective biography of the Roman Empire&#x27;s first leaders, Julius Caesar (the first few chapters are missing), Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Vespasian, Titus and Domitian. The book was dedicated to his friend Gaius Septicius Clarus, a prefect of the Praetorian Guard in 119. The work tells the tale of each Caesar&#x27;s life according to a set formula: the descriptions of appearance, omens, family history, quotes, and then a history are given in a consistent order. He recorded the earliest accounts of Julius Caesar&#x27;s epileptic seizures.

===Other works===

====Partly extant====
*&quot;De Viris Illustribus&quot; (&quot;On Famous Men&quot; — in the field of literature), to which belong:
**&quot;De Illustribus Grammaticis&quot; (&quot;Lives of the Grammarians&quot;; 20 brief lives, apparently complete)
**&quot;De Claris Rhetoribus&quot; (&quot;Lives of the Rhetoricians&quot;; 5 brief lives out of an original 16 survive)
**&quot;De Poetis&quot; (&quot;Lives of the Poets&quot;; the life of Virgil, as well as fragments from the lives of Terence, Horace and Lucan, survive)
**&quot;De Historicis&quot; (&quot;Lives of the historians&quot;; a brief life of Pliny the Elder is attributed to this work)
*&quot;Peri ton par&#x27; Hellesi paidion&quot; (&quot;Greek Games&quot;)
*&quot;Peri blasphemion&quot; (&quot;Greek Terms of Abuse&quot;)
The two last works were written in Greek. They apparently survive in part in the form of extracts in later Greek glossaries.

<doc id="37325" wikidata="Q172248" url="?curid=37325" title="Marcus Junius Brutus">
<text>Marcus Junius Brutus (; ; 85 BC – 23 October 42 BC) was a Roman politician, orator, and the most famous of the assassins of Julius Caesar. After being adopted by a relative, he used the name Quintus Servilius Caepio Brutus, which was retained as his legal name. He is often referred to simply as Brutus.

Early in his political career, Brutus opposed Pompey, who was responsible for Brutus&#x27; father&#x27;s death. He also was close to Caesar. However, Caesar&#x27;s attempts to evade accountability in the law courts put him at greater odds with his opponents in the Roman elite and the senate. Brutus eventually came to oppose Caesar and sided with Pompey against Caesar&#x27;s forces during the ensuing civil war (49–45 BC). Pompey was defeated at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48, after which Brutus surrendered to Caesar, who granted him amnesty.

With Caesar&#x27;s increasingly monarchical and autocratic behaviour after the civil war, several senators who later called themselves &quot;liberatores&quot; (liberators) plotted to assassinate him. Brutus took a leading role in the assassination, which was carried out successfully on the Ides of March (15 March) of 44 BC. In a settlement between the &quot;liberatores&quot; and the Caesarians, an amnesty was granted to the assassins while Caesar&#x27;s acts were upheld for two years.

Popular unrest forced Brutus and his brother-in-law, fellow assassin Gaius Cassius Longinus, to leave Rome in April 44. After a complex political realignment, Octavian – Caesar&#x27;s adopted son – made himself consul and, with his colleague, passed a law retroactively making Brutus and the other conspirators murderers. This led to a second civil war, in which Mark Antony and Octavian fought the &quot;liberatores&quot; led by Brutus and Cassius. The Caesarians decisively defeated the outnumbered armies of Brutus and Cassius at the two battles at Philippi in October 42. After the defeat Brutus took his own life.

His name has become a synonym and byword for &quot;betrayal&quot; or &quot;traitor&quot; in most languages of Europe. His condemnation for betrayal of Caesar, his friend and benefactor, is perhaps rivalled only by the name of Judas Iscariot, with whom he is portrayed in Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;. He also has been praised in various narratives, both ancient and modern, as a virtuous and committed republican who fought – however futilely – for freedom and against tyranny.

== Early life ==

Marcus Junius Brutus belonged to the illustrious plebeian gens Junia. Its semi-legendary founder was Lucius Junius Brutus, who played a pivotal role during the overthrow of Tarquinius Superbus, the last Roman king, and was afterward one of the two first consuls of the new Roman Republic in 509 BC, taking the opportunity also to have the people swear an oath never to have another king in Rome.

Brutus was born late in 85 BC. His homonymous father was tribune of the plebs in 83 BC, but he was targeted by Sulla during his proscription. He later served as legate in the rebellion of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and was killed by Pompey in 77. He had married Servilia of the Servilii Caepiones who was the half-sister of Cato the Younger, and later Julius Caesar&#x27;s mistress. Some ancient sources refer to the possibility of Caesar being Brutus&#x27; real father, despite Caesar being only fifteen years old when Brutus was born. Ancient historians were sceptical of this possibility, and the theory is largely rejected by modern scholars as chronologically improbable.

As a result of his father&#x27;s proscription, Brutus could not start a political career. Around 59, this restriction was lifted by Brutus&#x27; posthumous adoption by one of his relatives, Quintus Servilius Caepio; he was therefore known officially as Quintus Servilius Caepio Brutus, though he hardly used his legal name. In 59, when Caesar was consul, Brutus also was implicated by Lucius Vettius in the Vettius affair as a member of a conspiracy plotting to assassinate Pompey in the forum. Vettius was detained for admitting possession of a weapon within the city, and quickly changed this story the next day, dropping Brutus&#x27; name from his accusations.

Brutus&#x27; first appearance in public life was as an assistant to Cato, when the latter was appointed by the senate acting at the bequest of Publius Clodius Pulcher, as governor of Cyprus in 58. According to Plutarch, Brutus was instrumental in assisting the administration of the province (specifically by converting treasure of the former king of the island into usable money); his role in administering the province, however, has &quot;almost certainly been exaggerated&quot;.

=== &quot;Triumvir monetalis&quot; ===

In 54 BC, Brutus served as &quot;triumvir monetalis&quot;, one of the three men appointed annually for producing coins, even though only another colleague is known: Quintus Pompeius Rufus. Moneyers in Brutus&#x27; day frequently issued coins commemorating their ancestors; Pompeius Rufus thus put the portraits of his two grandfathers (the dictator Sulla and Pompeius Rufus) on his denarii. Brutus, like his colleague, designed a denarius with the portraits of his paternal ancestor Lucius Junius Brutus and maternal ancestor Gaius Servilius Ahala, both of whom were widely recognised in the late Republic as defenders of liberty (for, respectively, expelling the kings and killing Spurius Maelius). He also made a second type featuring Libertas, the goddess of liberty, and Lucius Brutus. These coins show Brutus&#x27; admiration for the tyrannicides of the early republic, already mentioned by Cicero as early as 59 BC. In addition, Brutus&#x27; denarii and their message against tyranny participated in the propaganda against Pompey and his ambitions to rule alone or become dictator.

=== Cilicia ===
Brutus married Appius Claudius Pulcher&#x27;s daughter Claudia, likely in 54 during Pulcher&#x27;s consulship. He was elected as quaestor (and automatically enrolled in the senate) in 53. Brutus then travelled with his father-in-law to Cilicia, likely as proquaestor, during the latter&#x27;s proconsulship in the next year. While in Cilicia, he spent some time as a money-lender, which was discovered two years later when Cicero was appointed proconsul between 51 and 50 BC. Brutus asked Cicero to help collect two debts which Brutus had made: one to Ariobarzanes, the king of Cappadocia, and one to the town of Salamis. Brutus&#x27; loan to Ariobarzanes was bundled with a loan also made by Pompey and both received some repayment on the debt.

The loan to Salamis was more complex: officially, the loan was made by two of Brutus&#x27; friends, who requested repayment at 48 per cent per annum, which was far in excess of Cicero&#x27;s previously imposed interest cap of 12 per cent. The loan dated back to 56, shortly after Brutus returned to Rome from Cyprus. Salamis had sent a delegation asking to borrow money, but under the &quot;lex Gabinia&quot; it was illegal for Romans to lend to provincials in the capital, but Brutus was able to find &quot;friends&quot; to loan this money on his behalf, which was approved under his influence in the senate. Because the &quot;lex Gabinia&quot; also invalidated such contracts, Brutus also had his contract – officially his friends&#x27; contract – confirmed by the senate. One of Brutus&#x27; friends in whose name the debt was officially issued, Marcus Scaptius, was in Cilicia during Cicero&#x27;s proconsulship using force to coerce repayment, which Cicero stopped; Cicero, not seeking to endanger his friendship with Brutus, but also disappointed and angry at Brutus&#x27; mischaracterisation of the loan and the exorbitant interest rate attached, was persuaded by Scaptius to defer a decision on the loan to the next governor.

=== Opposition to Pompey ===
In 52, in the aftermath of the death of his uncle-in-law, Publius Clodius Pulcher (brother of his wife&#x27;s father), he wrote a pamphlet, &quot;De Dictatura Pompei&quot; (On the Dictatorship of Pompey), opposing demands for Pompey to be made dictator, writing &quot;it is better to rule no one than to be another man&#x27;s slave, for one can live honourably without power but to live as a slave is impossible&quot;. He was in this episode more radical than Cato the Younger, who supported Pompey&#x27;s elevation as sole consul for 52, saying &quot;any government at all is better than no government&quot;. Soon after Pompey was made sole consul, Pompey passed the &quot;lex Pompeia de vi&quot;, which targeted Titus Annius Milo, for which Cicero would write a speech &quot;pro Milone&quot;. Brutus also wrote for Milo, writing (a now lost) &quot;pro T Annio Milone&quot;, in which he connected Milo&#x27;s killing of Clodius explicitly to the welfare of the state and possibly also criticising what he saw as Pompey&#x27;s abuses of power. This speech or pamphlet was very well received and positively viewed by later teachers of rhetoric.

In the late 50s, Brutus was elected as a &quot;pontifex&quot;, one of the public priests in charge of supervising the calendar and maintaining Rome&#x27;s peaceful relationship with the gods. It is likely that Caesar supported his election. Caesar had previously invited Brutus, after his quaestorship, to join him as a legate in Gaul, but Brutus declined, instead going with Appius Pulcher to Cilicia, possibly out of loyalty thereto. During the 50s, Brutus also was involved in some major trials, working alongside famous advocates like Cicero and Quintus Hortensius. In 50, he – with Pompey and Hortensius – played a significant role in defending Brutus&#x27; father-in-law Appius Claudius from charges of treason and electoral malpractice.

In the political crisis running up to Caesar&#x27;s Civil War in 49, Brutus&#x27; views are mostly unknown. While he did oppose Pompey until 52, Brutus may have simply taken a tactical silence. Cicero&#x27;s letters also indicate that Brutus may have been courted by Caesar – who is said to have spoken about avenging the death of Brutus&#x27; father – in the run-up to the civil war.

== Caesar&#x27;s civil war ==

When Caesar&#x27;s Civil War broke out in January 49 BC between Pompey and Caesar, Brutus faced a choice between one or the other. Pompey and his allies fled the city before Caesar&#x27;s army arrived in March. Brutus decided to support his father&#x27;s killer, Pompey; this choice may have had mostly to do with Brutus&#x27; closest allies – Appius Claudius, Cato, Cicero, etc. – also all joining Pompey. He did not, however, immediately join Pompey, instead travelling to Cilicia as legate for Publius Sestius before joining Pompey in winter 49 or spring 48.

It is not known whether Brutus fought in the ensuing battles at Dyrrhachium and Pharsalus. Plutarch says that Caesar ordered his officers to take Brutus prisoner if he gave himself up voluntarily, but to leave him alone and do him no harm if he persisted in fighting against capture. After the massive Pompeian defeat at Pharsalus on 9 August 48, Brutus fled through marshland to Larissa, where he wrote to Caesar, who welcomed him graciously into his camp. Plutarch also implies that Brutus told Caesar of Pompey&#x27;s withdrawal plans to Egypt, but this is unlikely, as Brutus was not present when Pompey&#x27;s decision to go to Egypt was made.

While Caesar followed Pompey to Alexandria in 48–47, Brutus worked to effect a reconciliation between various Pompeians and Caesar. He arrived back in Rome in December 47. Caesar appointed Brutus as governor (likely as &quot;legatus pro praetore&quot;) for Cisalpine Gaul while he left for Africa in pursuit of Cato and Metellus Scipio. After Cato&#x27;s suicide following defeat at the battle of Thapsus on 6 April 46, Brutus was one of Cato&#x27;s eulogisers writing a pamphlet entitled &quot;Cato&quot; in which he reflected positively both on Cato&#x27;s life while highlighting Caesar&#x27;s &quot;clementia&quot;.

After Caesar&#x27;s last battle against the republican remnant in March 45, Brutus divorced his wife Claudia in June and promptly remarried his cousin Porcia, Cato&#x27;s daughter, late in the same month. According to Cicero the marriage caused a semi-scandal as Brutus failed to state a valid reason for his divorce from Claudia other than he wished to marry Porcia. Brutus&#x27; reasons for marrying Porcia are unclear, he may have been in love or it could have been a politically motivated marriage to position Brutus as heir to Cato&#x27;s supporters, although Brutus still had good relations with Caesar at this point. Porcia did not get along with Brutus’ mother, Servilia, and Cicero stated that both were very open in their resentment for each other.

Brutus also was promised the prestigious urban praetorship for 44 BC and possibly earmarked for the consulship in 41.

==Assassination of Julius Caesar==

There are various different traditions describing the way in which Brutus arrived to the decision to assassinate Caesar. Plutarch, Appian, and Cassius Dio, all writing in the imperial period, focused on peer pressure and Brutus&#x27; perceived philosophical duty to his country and his family&#x27;s reputation.

=== Conspiracy ===
By autumn 45, public opinion of Caesar was starting to sour: Plutarch, Appian, and Dio all reported graffiti glorifying Brutus&#x27; ancestor Lucius Junius Brutus, panning Caesar&#x27;s kingly ambitions, and derogatory comments made to Marcus Junius Brutus in Rome&#x27;s open-air courts that he was failing to live up to his ancestors. Dio reports this public support came from the people of Rome; Plutarch however has the graffiti created by elites to shame Brutus into action. Regardless of the specific impetus, modern historians believe that at least some portion of popular opinion had turned against Caesar by early 44.

Caesar deposed two plebeian tribunes in late January 44 for removing a crown from one of his statues; this attack on the tribunes undermined one of his main arguments – defending the rights of the tribunes – for going to civil war in 49. In February 44, Caesar thrice rejected a crown from Marcus Antonius to cheering crowds, but later accepted the title &quot;dictator perpetuo&quot;, which in Latin translated either to dictator for life or as dictator for an undetermined term.

Cicero also wrote letters asking Brutus to reconsider his association with Caesar. Cassius Dio claims that Brutus&#x27; wife Porcia spurred Brutus&#x27; conspiracy, but evidence is unclear as to the extent of her influence. Gaius Cassius Longinus, also one of the praetors for that year and a former legate of Caesar&#x27;s, also was involved in the formation of the conspiracy. Plutarch has Brutus approach Cassius at his wife&#x27;s urging, while Appian and Dio have Cassius approaching Brutus (and in Dio, Cassius does so after opposing further honours for Caesar publicly).

The extent of Caesar&#x27;s control over the political system also stymied the ambitions of many aristocrats of Brutus&#x27; generation: Caesar&#x27;s dictatorship precluded many of the avenues for success which Romans recognised. The reduction of the senate to a rubber stamp ended political discussion in Caesar&#x27;s senate; there was no longer any room for anyone to shape policy except by convincing Caesar; political success became a grant of Caesar&#x27;s rather than something won competitively from the people. The Platonian philosophical tradition, of which Brutus was an active writer and thinker, also emphasised a duty to restore justice and to overthrow tyrants.

Regardless of how the conspiracy was initially formed, Brutus and Cassius, along with Brutus&#x27; cousin and close ally of Caesar&#x27;s, Decimus Junius Brutus, started to recruit to the conspiracy in late February 44. They recruited men including Gaius Trebonius, Publius Servilius Casca, Servius Sulpicius Galba, and others. There was a discussion late in the conspiracy as to whether Antony should be killed, which Brutus forcefully rejected: Plutarch says Brutus thought Antony could be turned to the tyrannicides; Appian says Brutus thought of the optics of purging the Caesarian elite rather than only removing a tyrant.

Various plans were proposed – an ambush on the &quot;via sacra&quot;, an attack at the elections, or killing at a gladiator match – eventually, however, the conspiracy settled on a senate meeting on the Ides of March. The specific date carried symbolic importance, as consuls until the mid-2nd century BC had assumed their offices on that day (instead of early January). The reasons for choosing the Ides are unclear: Nicolaus of Damascus (writing in the Augustan period) assumed that a senate meeting would isolate Caesar from support; Appian reports on the possibility of other senators coming to the assassins&#x27; aid. Both possibilities &quot;are unlikely&quot; due to Caesar&#x27;s expansion of the senate and the low number of conspirators relative to the whole senate body. More likely is Dio&#x27;s suggestion that a senate meeting would give the conspirators a tactical advantage as, by smuggling weapons, only the conspirators would be armed.

=== Ides of March ===
The ancient sources embellish the Ides with omens ignored, soothsayers spurned, and notes to Caesar spilling the conspiracy unread, all contributing to the dramatic and tragic propagandic stories of Caesar&#x27;s death. The specific implementation of the conspiracy had Trebonius detain Antony – then serving as co-consul with Caesar – outside the senate house; Caesar was then stabbed to death almost immediately. The specific details of the assassination vary between authors: Nicolaus of Damascus reports some eighty conspirators, Appian only listed fifteen, the number of wounds on Caesar ranges from twenty-three to thirty-five.

Plutarch reports that Caesar yielded to the attack after seeing Brutus&#x27; participation; Dio reported that Caesar shouted in Greek &quot;kai su teknon&quot; (&quot;You too, child?&quot;). Suetonius&#x27; account, however, also cites Lucius Cornelius Balbus, a friend of Caesar&#x27;s, as saying that the dictator fell in silence, with the possibility that Caesar spoke &quot;kai su teknon&quot; as a postscript. As dramatic death quotes were a staple of Roman literature, the historicity of the quote is unclear. The use of &quot;kai su&quot;, however, indicates the possibility of a curse, per classicists James Russell and Jeffrey Tatum.

Immediately after Caesar&#x27;s death, senators fled the chaos. None attempted to aid Caesar or to move his body. Cicero reported that Caesar fell at the foot of the statue of Pompey. His body was only moved after night fell, carried home to Caesar&#x27;s wife Calpurnia. The conspirators travelled to the Capitoline Hill; Caesar&#x27;s deputy in the dictatorship, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, moved a legion of troops from the Tiber Island into the city and surrounded the forum. Suetonius reports that Brutus and Cassius initially planned to seize Caesar&#x27;s property and revoke his decrees, but stalled out of fear of Lepidus and Antony.

Before Lepidus&#x27; troops arrived to the forum, Brutus spoke before the people in a &quot;contio&quot;. The text of that speech is lost. Dio says the &quot;liberatores&quot; promoted their support of democracy and liberty and told the people not to expect harm; Appian says the &quot;liberatores&quot; merely congratulated each other and recommended the recall of Sextus Pompey and the tribunes Caesar had recently deposed. The support of the people was tepid, even though other speeches followed supporting the tyrannicide. Publius Cornelius Dolabella, who was to become consul in a few days on the 18th, decided immediately to assume the consulship illegally, expressed his support of Brutus and Cassius before the people, and joined the &quot;liberatores&quot; on the Capitoline.

Cicero urged the tyrannicides to call a meeting of the senate to gather its support; but instead Brutus sent a delegation to the Caesarians, asking for a negotiated settlement. This may have been due to family connections: Lepidus was married to one of Brutus&#x27; sisters; or perhaps Brutus believed that Antony could be won over. The Caesarians delayed for a day, moving troops and gathering weapons and supplies for a possible conflict.

After Caesar&#x27;s death, Dio reports a series of prodigies and miraculous occurrences which are &quot;self-evidently fantastic&quot; and likely fictitious. Some of the supposed prodigies did in fact occur, but were actually unrelated to Caesar&#x27;s death: Cicero&#x27;s statue was knocked over but only in the next year, Mt Etna in Sicily did erupt but not contemporaneously, a comet was seen in the sky but only months later.

=== Settlement ===
The initial plan from Brutus and Cassius seems to have been to establish a period of calm and then to work towards a general reconciliation. While the Caesarians had troops near the capital at hand, the &quot;liberatores&quot; were soon to assume control of vast provincial holdings in the east which would provide them, within the year, with large armies and resources. Seeing that the military situation was initially problematic, the &quot;liberatores&quot; decided then to ratify Caesar&#x27;s decrees so that they could hold on to their magistracies and provincial assignments to protect themselves and rebuild the republican front.

Cicero acted as an honest broker and hammered out a compromise solution: general amnesty for the assassins, ratification of Caesar&#x27;s acts and appointments for the next two years, and guarantees to Caesar&#x27;s veterans that they would receive their promised land grants. Caesar also was to receive a public funeral. If the settlement had held, there would have been a general resumption of the republic: Decimus would go to Gaul that year and be confirmed as consul in 42, where he would then hold elections for 41. The people celebrated the reconciliation but some of the hard-core Caesarians were convinced that civil war would follow.

Caesar&#x27;s funeral occurred on 20 March, with a rousing speech by Antony mourning the dictator and energising opposition against the tyrannicides. Various ancient sources report that the crowd set the senate house on fire and started a witch-hunt for the tyrannicides, but these may have been spurious embellishments added by Livy, according to T P Wiseman. Contrary to what is reported by Plutarch, the assassins stayed in Rome for a few weeks after the funeral until April 44, indicating some support among the population for the tyrannicides. A person calling himself Marius, claiming he was a descendant of Gaius Marius, started a plan to ambush Brutus and Cassius. Brutus, as urban praetor in charge of the city&#x27;s courts, was able to get a special dispensation to leave the capital for more than 10 days, and he withdrew to one of his estates in Lanuvium, 20 miles south-east of Rome. This fake Marius, for his threats to the tyrannicides (and to Antony&#x27;s political base), was executed by being thrown from the Tarpeian Rock in mid- or late April. Dolabella, the other consul, acting on his own initiative, took down an altar and column dedicated to Caesar.

By early May, Brutus was considering exile. Octavian&#x27;s arrival, along with the fake Marius, caused Antony to lose some of the support of his veterans, he responded by touring Campania – officially to settle Caesar&#x27;s veterans – but actually to buttress military support. Dolabella at this time was on the side of the &quot;liberatores&quot; and also was the only consul at Rome; Antony&#x27;s brother Lucius Antonius helped Octavian to announce publicly that he was to fulfil the conditions of Caesar&#x27;s will, handing an enormous amount of wealth to the citizenry. Brutus also wrote a number of speeches disseminated to the public defending his actions, emphasising how Caesar had invaded Rome, killed prominent citizens, and suppressed the popular sovereignty of the people.

By mid-May, Antony started on designs against Decimus Brutus&#x27; governorship in Cisalpine Gaul. He bypassed the senate and took the matter to the popular assemblies in June and enacted the reassignment of the Gallic province by law. At the same time, he proposed reassigning Brutus and Cassius from their provinces to instead purchase grain in Asia and Sicily. There was a meeting at Brutus&#x27; house attended by Cicero, Brutus and Cassius (and wives), and Brutus&#x27; mother, in which Cassius announced his intention to go to Syria while Brutus wanted to return to Rome, but ended up going to Greece. His initial plan to go to Rome, however, was to put on games in early July commemorating his ancestor Lucius Junius Brutus and promoting his cause; he instead delegated the games to a friend. Octavian also held games commemorating Caesar late in the month; around this time also, the &quot;liberatores&quot; started to prepare in earnest for civil war.

==&quot;Liberatores&quot;″ civil war==

=== Preparations in the East ===
The senate assigned Brutus to Crete (and Cassius to Cyrene) in early August, both small and insignificant provinces with few troops. Later in the month, Brutus left Italy for the east. He was acclaimed in Greece by the younger Romans there and recruited many supporters from the young Roman aristocrats being educated in Athens. He discussed with the governor of Macedonia handing the province over to him; while Antony in Rome allocated the province to his brother Gaius, Brutus travelled north with an army to Macedonia, buoyed by funds collected by two outgoing &quot;quaestores&quot; at the end of the year.

In January 43, Brutus entered Macedonia with his army, and took Antony&#x27;s brother Gaius captive. At the same time, the political situation in Rome turned against Antony, as Cicero was delivering his Phillipics. Over the next few months, Brutus spent his time in Greece building strength. In Italy, the senate at Cicero&#x27;s urging fought against Antony at the battle of Mutina, where both consuls (Hirtius and Pansa) were killed. During this time, the republicans enjoyed the support of the senate, which confirmed Brutus and Cassius&#x27; commands in Macedonia and Syria, respectively.

Dolabella switched sides in 43, killing Trebonius in Syria and raising an army against Cassius. Brutus decamped for Syria in early May, writing letters to Cicero criticising Cicero&#x27;s policy to support Octavian against Antony; at the same time, the senate had declared Antony an enemy of the state. In late May, Lepidus (married to Brutus&#x27; half-sister) – possibly forced by his own troops – joined Antony against Cicero, Octavian, and the senate, leading Brutus to write to Cicero asking him to protect both his own and Lepidus&#x27; family. The next month, Brutus&#x27; wife Porcia died.

Cicero&#x27;s policy of attempting to unify Octavian with the senate against Antony and Lepidus started to fail in May; he requested Brutus to take his forces and march to his aid in Italy in mid-June. It seems that Brutus and Cassius in the east had substantial communications delays and failed to recognise that Antony had not been defeated, contra earlier assurances after Mutina. Over the next few months from June to 19 August, Octavian marched on Rome and forced his election as consul. Shortly afterwards, Octavian and his colleague, Quintus Pedius, passed the &quot;lex Pedia&quot; making the murder of a dictator retroactively illegal, and convicting Brutus and the assassins &quot;in absentia&quot;. The new consuls also lifted the senate&#x27;s decrees against Lepidus and Antony, clearing the way for a general Caesarian rapprochement. Under that law, Decimus was killed in the west some time in autumn, defeating the republican cause in the west; by 27 November 43, the Caesarians had fully settled their differences and passed the &quot;lex Titia&quot;, forming the Second Triumvirate and instituting a series of brutal proscriptions. The proscriptions claimed many lives, including that of Cicero.

When news of the triumvirate and their proscriptions reached Brutus in the east, he marched across the Hellespont into Macedonia to quell rebellion and conquered a number of cities in Thrace. After meeting Cassius in Smyrna in January 42, both generals also went on a campaign through southern Asia minor sacking cities which had aided their enemies.

Brutus&#x27; depiction among certain authors, like Appian, suffered considerably from this eastern campaign, in which Brutus marched into cities like Xanthus enslaving their populations and plundering their wealth. Other ancient historians, including Plutarch, take a more apologetic tone, having Brutus regret with tears the violence done; this was common ancient literary device to excuse and praise morally condemnable actions, such as pillaging. The campaign continued with less sacking but more coerced payments; the ancient tradition on this turn also is divided, with Appian seeing eastern willingness to surrender emerging from stories of Xanthus&#x27; destruction contra Cassius Dio and Plutarch viewing the later portions of the campaign as emblematic of Brutus&#x27; virtues of moderation, justice, and honour.

By the end of the campaign in Asia minor, both Brutus and Cassius were tremendously rich. They reconvened at Sardis and marched into Thrace in August 42.

=== Philippi ===

The Caesarians also marched into Greece, evading the naval patrols of Sextus Pompey, , and Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus. The &quot;liberatores&quot; had positioned themselves west of Neapolis with clear lines of communication back to their supplies in the east. Octavian and Antony, leading the Caesarian forces, were not so lucky, as their supply lines were harassed by the superior republican fleets, leading the &quot;liberatores&quot; to adopt a strategy of attrition.

Octavian and Antony had some 95,000 infantry with 13,000 horsemen, while Brutus and Cassius had some 85,000 infantry and 20,000 cavalry. Flush with cash, the &quot;liberatores&quot; also had a substantial financial advantage, paying their soldiers in advance of the battle with 1,500 denarii a man and more for officers. Antony moved quickly to force an engagement immediately, building a causeway under cover of darkness into the swamps that anchored the republican left flank; Cassius, commanding the republican left, countered with a wall to cut off Antony from his men and to defend his own flank.

In the ensuing first battle of Philippi, the start of the battle is unclear. Appian says Antony attacked Cassius whereas Plutarch reports battle was joined more-or-less simultaneously. Brutus&#x27; forces defeated Octavian&#x27;s troops on the republican right flank, sacking Octavian&#x27;s camp and forcing the young Caesar to withdraw. Cassius&#x27; troops fared poorly against Antony&#x27;s men, forcing Cassius to withdraw to a hill. Two stories then follow: Appian reports that Cassius heard of Brutus&#x27; victory, and killed himself out of shame; but all other sources describe how one of Cassius&#x27; legates failed to relay the news of Brutus&#x27; victory, causing Cassius to believe that Brutus had been defeated, and leading to his suicide.

Following the first battle, Brutus assumed command of Cassius&#x27; army with the promise of a substantial cash reward. He also possibly promised his soldiers that he would allow them to plunder Thessalonica and Sparta after victory, as the cities had supported the triumvirs in the conflict. Fearful of defections among his troops and the possibility of Antony cutting his supply lines, Brutus joined battle after attempting for some time to continue the original strategy of starving the enemy out. The resulting second battle of Philippi was a head-to-head struggle in which the sources report few tactical manoeuvres but heavy casualties, especially among eminent republican families.

After the defeat, Brutus fled into the nearby hills with about four legions. Knowing his army had been defeated and that he would be captured, he took his own life by falling on his sword. Among his last words were, according to Plutarch, &quot;By all means must we fly, but with our hands, not our feet&quot;. Brutus reportedly also uttered the well-known verse calling down a curse quoted from Euripides&#x27; &quot;Medea&quot;: &quot;O Zeus, do not forget who has caused all these woes&quot;. It is, however, unclear whether Brutus was referring to Antony, as claimed by Appian, or otherwise Octavian, as Kathryn Tempest believes. Also according to Plutarch, he praised his friends for not deserting him before encouraging them to save themselves.

Some sources report that Antony, upon discovering Brutus&#x27; body, as a show of great respect, ordered it to be wrapped in Antony&#x27;s most expensive purple mantle and cremated, with the ashes to be sent to Brutus&#x27; mother, Servilia. Suetonius, however, reports that Octavian had Brutus&#x27; head cut off and planned to have it displayed before a statue of Caesar until it was thrown overboard during a storm in the Adriatic.

== Legacy ==
Brutus&#x27; historical character has undergone numerous revisions and remains divisive. Dominant views of Brutus vary by time and geography.

=== Ancient views ===

In the ancient world, Brutus&#x27; legacy was a topic of substantial debate. Starting from his own times and shortly after his death, he was already viewed as having killed Caesar for virtuous reasons rather than envy or hatred. For example, Plutarch, in his &quot;Life of Brutus&quot; from &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;, mentions that Brutus&#x27; enemies respected him, recounting that Antony once said that &quot;Brutus was the only man to have slain Caesar because he was driven by the splendour and nobility of the deed, while the rest conspired against the man because they hated and envied him&quot;.

Even when he was still alive, Brutus&#x27; literary output, especially the pamphlets of 52 BC against Pompey&#x27;s dictatorship (&quot;De dictatura Pompei&quot;) and in support of Milo (&quot;Pro T. Annio Milone&quot;) coloured him as philosophically consistent, and motivated only by principle. Cicero, in his &quot;De Officiis&quot;, expressed that the act of the conspirators, including Brutus, was a moral duty. The main charge against him in the ancient world was that of ingratitude, viewing Brutus as ungrateful in taking Caesar&#x27;s goodwill and support and then killing him. An even more negative historiographical tradition viewed Brutus and his compatriots as criminal murderers. Still, during the Augustan age, historians were said to have written about Brutus and the other conspirators respectfully. Even Augustus himself was alleged to tolerate positive views of Brutus. However, the Forum of Augustus, which included statues of various republican heroes, omitted men such as Cato the Younger, Cicero, Brutus, and Cassius.

The divisive views of Brutus in the early Principate had little changed by the reign of Tiberius; in fact, the atmosphere became more intolerant. The historian Cremutius Cordus was charged with treason for having written a history too friendly to Brutus and Cassius. Around the same time, Valerius Maximus, writing with the support of the imperial regime, believed Brutus&#x27; memory suffered from &quot;irreversible curses&quot;. During this time, &quot;admiration of Brutus and Cassius was more sinisterly interpreted as a cry of protest against the imperial system&quot;. The stoic, Seneca the Younger, argued that since Caesar was a good king, Brutus&#x27; fear was unfounded, and that he did not think through the consequences of Caesar&#x27;s death.

But by the time that Plutarch was actually writing his &quot;Life of Brutus&quot;, &quot;the oral and written tradition had been worked over to create a streamlined, and largely positive, narrative of Brutus&#x27; motives&quot;. Some high imperial writers also admired his rhetorical skills, especially Pliny the Younger and Tacitus, with the latter writing, &quot;in my opinion, Brutus alone among them laid bare the convictions of his heart frankly and ingeniously, with neither ill-will nor spite&quot;.

=== Medieval and Renaissance views ===
In the 12th century, English writer John of Salisbury, who owned a copy of &quot;De Officis&quot;, emulated Cicero’s beliefs by defending tyrannicide as a moral obligation. Thomas Aquinas also initially agreed with Cicero’s defense of Brutus. However, he later changed his beliefs, expressing that while tyrants should be overthrown under certain circumstances, mild tyrants ought to be tolerated out of possible unintended consequences.

Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; notably placed Brutus in the lowest circle of Hell for his betrayal of Caesar, where he (along with Cassius and Judas Iscariot) is personally tortured by Satan. Dante&#x27;s views gave a further theological bent as well: by killing Caesar, Brutus &quot;was resisting God&#x27;s &#x27;historical design&#x27;&quot;: the development of the Roman Empire with its fusion with Christianity and the Christianised monarchies of his day.

Renaissance writers, however, tended to view him more positively, as Brutus&#x27; assassination of Caesar symbolised ancient republican ideology. Various men in the renaissance and early modern periods were called or adopted the name Brutus: In 1537, the &quot;Florentine Brutus&quot;, Lorenzino de&#x27; Medici, killed his cousin Duke Alessandro allegedly to free Florence; the French pamphlet &quot;Vindiciae contra tyrannos&quot; (Defences against tyrants) was published in 1579 under the pseudonym Stephanus Junius Brutus; the &quot;British Brutus&quot; Algernon Sidney was executed in 1683 for allegedly plotting against Charles II. Brutus was also present in the arts during the early modern period, particularly in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, which depicted him &quot;more of a troubled soul than a public symbol... [and] often sympathetic&quot;.

=== Modern views ===

Views of Brutus as a symbol of republicanism have remained through the modern period. For example, the Anti-Federalist Papers in 1787 were written under the pseudonym &quot;Brutus&quot;. Similar anti-federalist letters and pamphlets were written by other Roman republican names such as Cato and Poplicola.

Conyers Middleton and Edward Gibbon, writing in the late 18th century, had negative views. Middleton believed Brutus&#x27; vacillations in correspondence with Cicero betrayed his claims to philosophical consistency. Gibbon conceived of Brutus&#x27; actions in terms of their results: the destruction of the republic, civil war, death, and future tyranny. More teleological views of Brutus&#x27; actions are viewed sceptically by historians today: Ronald Syme, for example, pointed out &quot;to judge Brutus because he failed is simply to judge from the results&quot;.

The influential &quot;History of Rome&quot; by Theodor Mommsen in the late 19th century &quot;cast a damning verdict on Brutus&quot; by ending with Caesar&#x27;s reforms in 46 BC, along with advancing a view that Caesar &quot;had some sort of solution to the problem of how to deal with Rome&#x27;s growing empire&quot; (of which there is no surviving description). Similarly, views of Brutus are also bound up with assessment of the republic: those who believe the republic was not worth saving or in an inevitable decline, views perhaps coloured by hindsight, view him more negatively.

There remains little consensus on Brutus&#x27; actions as a whole.

== In popular culture ==

* In Jonathan Swift&#x27;s 1726 satire Gulliver&#x27;s Travels, Gulliver arrives at the island of Glubbdubdrib and is invited by a sorcerer to visit with several historical figures brought back from the dead. Among them, Caesar and Brutus are evoked, and Caesar confesses that all his glory doesn&#x27;t equal the glory Brutus gained by murdering him.
* In the &quot;Masters of Rome&quot; novels of Colleen McCullough, Brutus is portrayed as a timid intellectual whose relationship with Caesar is deeply complex. He resents Caesar for breaking his marriage arrangement with Caesar&#x27;s daughter, Julia, whom Brutus deeply loved so that she could be married instead to Pompey the Great. However, Brutus enjoys Caesar&#x27;s favor after he receives a pardon for fighting with Republican forces against Caesar at the Battle of Pharsalus. In the lead-up to the Ides of March, Cassius and Trebonius use him as a figurehead because of his family connections to the founder of the Republic. He appears in &quot;Fortune&#x27;s Favourites&quot;, &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Women&quot;, &quot;Caesar&quot; and &quot;The October Horse&quot;.
* Brutus is an occasional supporting character in Asterix comics, most notably &quot;Asterix and Son&quot; in which he is the main antagonist. The character appears in the first three live Asterix film adaptations – though briefly in the first two – &quot;Asterix and Obelix vs Caesar&quot; (played by Didier Cauchy) and &quot;Asterix at the Olympic Games&quot;. In the latter film, he is portrayed as a comical villain by Belgian actor Benoît Poelvoorde: he is a central character to the film, even though he was not depicted in the original &quot;Asterix at the Olympic Games&quot; comic book. He is implied in that film to be Julius Caesar&#x27;s biological son.
* In the TV series &quot;Rome&quot;, Brutus, portrayed by Tobias Menzies, is depicted as a young man torn between what he believes is right, and his loyalty to and love of a man who has been like a father to him. In the series, his personality and motives are somewhat inaccurate, as Brutus is portrayed as an unwilling participant in politics. In the earlier episodes, he is frequently inebriated and easily ruled by emotion. Brutus&#x27; relationship to Cato is not mentioned; his three sisters and wife, Porcia, are omitted.
* The Hives&#x27; song &quot;B is for Brutus&quot; contains titular and lyrical references to Junius Brutus.
* Red Hot Chili Peppers song &quot;Even You Brutus?&quot; from their 2011 album &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot; makes reference to Brutus and Judas Iscariot.
* The video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Brotherhood&quot; features a small side story in the form of the &quot;Scrolls of Romulus&quot; written by Brutus, which reveals that Caesar was a Templar, and Brutus and the conspirators were members of the Roman Brotherhood of Assassins. At the end of the side quest, the player is able to get Brutus&#x27; armour and dagger. Later at &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins&quot;, Brutus and Cassius make an appearance as Aya&#x27;s earliest recruits and is the one who give the killing blow to Caesar, though his armour from &quot;Brotherhood&quot; does not make an appearance here.

<text>Year 59 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Caesar and Bibulus (or, less frequently, year 695 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 59 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Roman Republic ====
* Consuls: Gaius Julius Caesar and Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus (known in jest as &quot;the consulship of Julius and Caesar&quot; due to Bibulus&#x27; Social withdrawal from public view to &quot;consult the heavens&quot; in an effort to invalidate Caesar&#x27;s intended legislation).
* Caesar makes the Acta Diurna (Daily News), the world&#x27;s first daily newspaper, public. The Acta contains details of official decrees and appointments; births, deaths, and marriages. Even sport results—the outcome of the gladiatorial contests and chariot races at the capital.
* The First Triumvirate: Caesar, Pompey and Crassus form an unofficial alliance (or 60 BC).
* Caesar marries Calpurnia, in Rome.
* The colonia of Florentia, modern Florence, founded.

<text>The Circus Maximus (Latin for &quot;largest circus&quot;; Italian: &quot;Circo Massimo&quot;) is an ancient Roman chariot-racing stadium and mass entertainment venue in Rome, Italy. In the valley between the Aventine and Palatine hills, it was the first and largest stadium in ancient Rome and its later Empire. It measured in length and in width and could accommodate over 150,000 spectators. In its fully developed form, it became the model for circuses throughout the Roman Empire. The site is now a public park.

== Events and uses ==
The Circus was Rome&#x27;s largest venue for &quot;ludi&quot;, public games connected to Roman religious festivals. &quot;Ludi&quot; was sponsored by leading Romans or the Roman state for the benefit of the Roman people (&quot;populus Romanus&quot;) and gods. Most events were held annually or at annual intervals on the Roman calendar. Others might be given to fulfil a religious vow, such as the games in celebration of a triumph. In Roman tradition, the earliest triumphal &quot;ludi&quot; at the Circus were vowed by Tarquin the Proud to Jupiter in the late Regal era for his victory over Pometia.

&quot;Ludi&quot; ranged in duration and scope from one-day or even half-day events to spectacular multi-venue celebrations held over several days, with religious ceremonies and public feasts, horse and chariot racing, athletics, plays and recitals, beast-hunts and gladiator fights. Some included public executions. The greater &quot;ludi&quot; (meaning sport or game in Latin) at the Circus began with a flamboyant parade &quot;(pompa circensis)&quot;, much like the triumphal procession, which marked the purpose of the games and introduced the participants.

During the Roman Republic, the aediles organized the games. The most costly and complex of the &quot;ludi&quot; offered opportunities to assess an aedile&#x27;s competence, generosity, and fitness for higher office. Some Circus events, however, seem to have been relatively small and intimate affairs. In 167 BC, &quot;flute players, scenic artists and dancers&quot; performed on a temporary stage, probably erected between the two central seating banks. Others were enlarged at enormous expense to fit the entire space. A &quot;venatio&quot; held there in 169 BC, one of several in the 2nd century, employed &quot;63 leopards and 40 bears and elephants&quot;, with spectators presumably kept safe by a substantial barrier.

As Rome&#x27;s provinces expanded, the existing &quot;ludi&quot; was embellished and a new &quot;ludi&quot; invented by politicians who competed for divine and popular support. By the late Republic, &quot;ludi&quot; were held on 57 days of the year; an unknown number of these would have required full use of the Circus. On many other days, charioteers and jockeys would need to practice on its track. Otherwise, it would have made a convenient corral for the animals traded in the nearby Forum Boarium, just outside the starting gate. Beneath the outer stands, next to the Circus&#x27; entrances, were workshops and shops. When no games were being held, the Circus at the time of Catullus (mid-1st century BC) was probably &quot;a dusty open space with shops and booths ... a colourful crowded disreputable area&quot; frequented by &quot;prostitutes, jugglers, fortune tellers and low-class performing artists&quot;.
Rome&#x27;s emperors met the growing popular demand for regular &quot;ludi&quot; and the need for more specialised venues, as obligations of their office and cult. Over the centuries of its development, the Circus Maximus became Rome&#x27;s paramount specialist venue for chariot races. By the late 1st century AD, the Colosseum had been built for most of the city&#x27;s gladiator shows and smaller beast-hunts and most track-athletes competed at the purpose-designed Stadium of Domitian, though long-distance foot races were still held at the Circus. Eventually, 135 days of the year were devoted to &quot;ludi&quot;.

Even at the height of its development as a chariot-racing circuit, the circus remained the most suitable space in Rome for religious processions on a grand scale and was the most popular venue for large-scale &quot;venationes&quot;; in the late 3rd century, the emperor Probus laid on a spectacular Circus show in which beasts were hunted through a veritable forest of trees, on a specially built stage. With the advent of Christianity as the &quot;Official Religion&quot; of the Empire, &quot;ludi&quot; gradually fell out of favour. The last known beast hunt at the Circus Maximus took place in 523, and of the last known races there were held by Totila in 549.

== Topography and construction ==
=== Regal era ===

The Circus Maximus was sited on the level ground of the Valley of Murcia &quot;(Vallis Murcia)&quot;, between Rome&#x27;s Aventine and Palatine Hills. In Rome&#x27;s early days, the valley would have been rich agricultural land, prone to flooding from the river Tiber and the stream which divided the valley lengthwise. The stream was probably bridged at an early date, at the two points where the track had to cross it, and the earliest races would have been held within an agricultural landscape, &quot;with nothing more than turning posts, banks where spectators could sit, and some shrines and sacred spots&quot;.

In Livy&#x27;s &quot;History of Rome&quot;, the first Etruscan king of Rome, Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, built raised, wooden perimeter seating at the Circus for Rome&#x27;s highest echelons (the equites and patricians), probably midway along the Palatine straight, with an awning against the sun and rain. His grandson, Tarquinius Superbus, added the first seating for citizen-commoners (plebs, or plebeians), either adjacent or on the opposite, Aventine side of the track. Otherwise, the Circus was probably still little more than a trackway through surrounding farmland. By this time, it may have been drained but the wooden stands and seats would have frequently rotted and been rebuilt. The turning posts (&quot;metae&quot;), each made of three conical stone pillars, may have been the earliest permanent Circus structures; an open drainage canal between the posts would have served as a dividing barrier.

=== Republican era ===
The games&#x27; sponsor (Latin &quot;editor)&quot; usually sat beside the images of attending gods, on a conspicuous, elevated stand (&quot;pulvinar&quot;) but seats at the track&#x27;s perimeter offered the best, most dramatic close-ups. In 494 BC (very early in the Republican era) the dictator Manius Valerius Maximus and his descendants were granted rights to a curule chair at the southeastern turn, an excellent viewpoint for the thrills and spills of chariot racing. In the 190s BC, stone track-side seating was built, exclusively for senators.

Permanent wooden starting stalls were built in 329 BC. They were gated, brightly painted, and staggered to equalise the distances from each start place to the central barrier. In theory, they might have accommodated up to 25 four-horse chariots (Quadrigas) abreast but when team-racing was introduced, they were widened, and their number reduced. By the late Republican or early Imperial era, there were twelve stalls. Their divisions were fronted by herms that served as stops for spring-loaded gates, so that twelve light-weight, four-horse or two-horse chariots could be simultaneously released onto the track. The stalls were allocated by lottery, and the various racing teams were identified by their colors. Typically, there were seven laps per race. From at least 174 BC, they were counted off using large sculpted eggs. In 33 BC, an additional system of large bronze dolphin-shaped lap counters was added, positioned well above the central dividing barrier &quot;(euripus)&quot; for maximum visibility.
Julius Caesar&#x27;s development of the Circus, commencing around 50 BC, extended the seating tiers to run almost the entire circuit of the track, barring the starting gates and a processional entrance at the semi-circular end. The track measured approximately in length and in breadth. A canal between the track perimeter and its seating protected spectators and help drain the track. The inner third of the seating formed a trackside &quot;cavea&quot;. Its front sections along the central straight were reserved for senators, and those immediately behind for &quot;equites&quot;. The outer tiers, two thirds of the total, were meant for Roman plebs and non-citizens. They were timber-built, with wooden-framed service buildings, shops and entrance-ways beneath. The total number of seats is uncertain, but was probably in the order of 150,000; Pliny the Elder&#x27;s estimate of 250,000 seating places is unlikely. The wooden bleachers were damaged in a fire of 31 BC, either during or after construction.

=== Imperial era ===

The fire damage of 31 was probably repaired by Augustus (Caesar&#x27;s successor and Rome&#x27;s first emperor). He modestly claimed credit only for an obelisk and &quot;pulvinar&quot; at the site but both were major projects. Ever since its quarrying, long before Rome existed, the obelisk had been sacred to Egyptian Sun-gods. Augustus had it brought from Heliopolis at enormous expense, and erected midway along the dividing barrier of the Circus. It was Rome&#x27;s first obelisk, an exotically sacred object and a permanent reminder of Augustus&#x27; victory over his Roman foes and their Egyptian allies in the recent civil wars. Thanks to him, Rome had secured both a lasting peace and a new Egyptian Province. The &quot;pulvinar&quot; was built on monumental scale, a shrine or temple (&quot;aedes&quot;) raised high above the trackside seats. Sometimes, while games were in progress, Augustus watched from there, alongside the gods. Occasionally, his family would join him there. This is the Circus described by Dionysius of Halicarnassus as &quot;one of the most beautiful and admirable structures in Rome&quot;, with &quot;entrances and ascents for the spectators at every shop, so that the countless thousands of people may enter and depart without inconvenience.&quot;

The site remained prone to flooding, probably through the starting gates, until Claudius made improvements there; they probably included an extramural anti-flooding embankment. Fires in the crowded, wooden perimeter workshops and bleachers were a far greater danger. A fire of 36 AD seems to have started in a basket-maker&#x27;s workshop under the stands, on the Aventine side; the emperor Tiberius compensated various small businesses there for their losses. In AD 64, during Nero&#x27;s reign, fire broke out at the semi-circular end of the Circus, swept through the stands and shops, and destroyed much of the city. Games and festivals continued at the Circus, which was rebuilt over several years to the same footprint and design.

By the late 1st century AD, the central dividing barrier comprised a series of water basins, or else a single watercourse open in some places and bridged over in others. It offered opportunities for artistic embellishment and decorative swagger, and included the temples and statues of various deities, fountains, and refuges for those assistants involved in more dangerous circus activities, such as beast-hunts and the recovery of casualties during races.

In AD 81 the Senate built a triple arch honoring Titus at the semi-circular end of the Circus, to replace or augment a former processional entrance. The emperor Domitian built a new, multi-storey palace on the Palatine, connected somehow to the Circus; he likely watched the games in autocratic style, from high above and barely visible to those below. Repairs to fire damage during his reign may already have been under way before his assassination.

The risk of further fire-damage, coupled with Domitian&#x27;s fate, may have prompted Trajan&#x27;s decision to rebuild the Circus entirely in stone, and provide a new pulvinar in the stands where Rome&#x27;s emperor could be seen and honoured as part of the Roman community, alongside their gods. Under Trajan, the Circus Maximus found its definitive form, which was unchanged thereafter save for some monumental additions by later emperors, an extensive, planned rebuilding of the starting gate area under Caracalla, and repairs and renewals to existing fabric. Of these, Pliny claims that Trajan&#x27;s works gained a further 5,000 seats. Some repairs were unforeseen and extensive, such as those carried out in Diocletian&#x27;s reign, after the collapse of a seating section killed some 13,000 people.

== Religious significance ==

The southeastern turn of the track ran between two shrines which may have predated the Circus&#x27; formal development. One, at the outer southeast perimeter, was dedicated to the valley&#x27;s eponymous goddess Murcia, an obscure deity associated with Venus, the myrtle shrub, a sacred spring, the stream that divided the valley, and the lesser peak of the Aventine Hill. The other was at the southeastern turning-post, where there was an underground shrine to Consus, a minor god of grain-stores, connected to the grain-goddess Ceres and to the underworld. According to Roman tradition, Romulus discovered this shrine shortly after the founding of Rome. He invented the Consualia festival, as a way of gathering his Sabine neighbours at a celebration that included horse-races and drinking. During these distractions, Romulus&#x27;s men then abducted the Sabine daughters as brides. Thus the famous Roman myth of the Rape of the Sabine women had as its setting the Circus and the Consualia.

In this quasi-legendary era, horse or chariot races would have been held at the Circus site. The track width may have been determined by the distance between Murcia&#x27;s and Consus&#x27; shrines at the southeastern end, and its length by the distance between these two shrines and Hercules&#x27; Ara Maxima, supposedly older than Rome itself and sited behind the Circus&#x27; starting place. The position of Consus&#x27; shrine at the turn of the track recalls the placing of shrines to Roman Neptune&#x27;s Greek equivalent, Poseidon, in Greek hippodromes. In later developments, the altar of Consus, as one of the Circus&#x27; patron deities, was incorporated into the fabric of the south-eastern turning post. When Murcia&#x27;s stream was partly built over, to form a dividing barrier (the &quot;spina&quot; or &quot;euripus&quot;) between the turning posts, her shrine was either retained or rebuilt. In the Late Imperial period, both the southeastern turn and the circus itself were sometimes known as &quot;Vallis Murcia&quot;. The symbols used to count race-laps also held religious significance; Castor and Pollux, who were born from an egg, were patrons of horses, horsemen, and the equestrian order &quot;(equites)&quot;. Likewise, the later use of dolphin-shaped lap counters reinforced associations between the races, swiftness, and Neptune, as god of earthquakes and horses; the Romans believed dolphins to be the swiftest of all creatures. When the Romans adopted the Phrygian Great Mother as an ancestral deity, a statue of her on lion-back was erected within the circus, probably on the dividing barrier.
Sun and Moon cults were probably represented at the Circus from its earliest phases. Their importance grew with the introduction of Roman cult to Apollo, and the development of Stoic and solar monism as a theological basis for the Roman Imperial cult. In the Imperial era, the Sun-god was divine patron of the Circus and its games. His sacred obelisk towered over the arena, set in the central barrier, close to his temple and the finishing line. The Sun-god was the ultimate, victorious charioteer, driving his four-horse chariot (&quot;quadriga&quot;) through the heavenly circuit from sunrise to sunset. His partner Luna drove her two-horse chariot (&quot;biga&quot;); together, they represented the predictable, orderly movement of the cosmos and the circuit of time, which found analogy in the Circus track. Luna&#x27;s temple, which was probably built long before Apollo&#x27;s, burned down in the Great Fire of 64 AD and was probably not replaced. Her cult was closely identified with that of Diana, who seems to have been represented in the processions that started Circus games, and with Sol Indiges, usually identified as her brother. After the loss of her temple, her cult may have been transferred to Sol&#x27;s temple on the dividing barrier, or one beside it; both would have been open to the sky.

Temples to several deities overlooked the Circus; most are now lost. The temples to Ceres and Flora stood close together on the Aventine, more or less opposite the Circus&#x27; starting gate, which remained under Hercules&#x27; protection. Further southeast along the Aventine was a temple to Luna, the moon goddess. Aventine temples to Venus Obsequens, Mercury and Dis (or perhaps Summanus) stood on the slopes above the southeast turn. On the Palatine hill, opposite to Ceres&#x27;s temple, stood the temple to Magna Mater and, more or less opposite Luna&#x27;s temple, one to the sun-god Apollo.

Several festivals, some of uncertain foundation and date, were held at the Circus in historical times. The Consualia, with its semi-mythical establishment by Romulus, and the Cerealia, the major festival of Ceres, were probably older than the earliest historically attested &quot;Roman Games&quot; &quot;(Ludi Romani)&quot; held at the Circus in honour of Jupiter in 366 BC. In the early Imperial era, Ovid describes the opening of Cerealia (mid to late April) with a horse race at the Circus, followed by the nighttime release of foxes into the stadium, their tails ablaze with lighted torches. Some early connection is likely between Ceres as goddess of grain crops and Consus as a god of grain storage and patron of the Circus.

== Modern status and uses ==

After the 6th century, the Circus fell into disuse and decay. The lower levels, ever prone to flooding, were gradually buried under waterlogged alluvial soil and accumulated debris, so that the original track is now buried six meters beneath the modern surface. In the 11th century, the Circus was &quot;replaced by dwellings rented out by the congregation of Saint-Guy.&quot; In the 12th century, a watercourse was dug there to drain the soil, and by the 16th century the area was used as a market garden. During the renaissance, the site was one of many used as a convenient quarry for good quality building stone. Many of the Circus&#x27;s standing structures survived these changes; in 1587, two obelisks were removed from the central barrier by Pope Sixtus V, and one of these was re-sited at the Piazza del Popolo. In 1852, a gas works was built on the site by the Anglo-Italian Gas Society. It remained in situ until 1910 when it was relocated to the edge of Rome. Mid-19th century workings at the circus site uncovered the lower parts of a seating tier and outer portico. Since then, a series of excavations has exposed further sections of the seating, curved turn and central barrier but further exploration has been limited by the scale, depth and waterlogging of the site.
The Circus site now functions as a large park area, open to the public and often used for concerts, meetings, and celebrations.

<doc id="37329" wikidata="Q101497" url="?curid=37329" title="Aldehyde">
<text>In organic chemistry, an aldehyde () is an organic compound containing a functional group with the structure . The functional group itself (without the &quot;R&quot; side chain) can be referred to as an aldehyde but can also be classified as a formyl group. Aldehydes are a common motif in many chemicals important in technology and biology.

==Structure and bonding==
Aldehyde molecules have a central carbon atom that is connected by a double bond to oxygen, a single bond to hydrogen and another single bond to a third substituent, which is carbon or, in the case of formaldehyde, hydrogen. The central carbon is often described as being sp2-hybridized. The aldehyde group is somewhat polar. The bond length is about 120–122 picometers.

==Physical properties and characterization==
Aldehydes have properties that are diverse and that depend on the remainder of the molecule. Smaller aldehydes such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are soluble in water, and the volatile aldehydes have pungent odors.

Aldehydes can be identified by spectroscopic methods. Using IR spectroscopy, they display a strong &quot;ν&quot;CO band near 1700 cm−1. In their 1H NMR spectra, the formyl hydrogen center absorbs near &quot;δ&quot;H 9.5 to 10, which is a distinctive part of the spectrum. This signal shows the characteristic coupling to any protons on the α carbon with a small coupling constant typically less than 3.0 Hz. The 13C NMR spectra of aldehydes and ketones gives a suppressed (weak) but distinctive signal at &quot;δ&quot;C 190 to 205.

==Applications and occurrence==
 Important aldehydes and related compounds. The aldehyde group (or formyl group) is colored red. From the left: (1) formaldehyde and (2) its trimer 1,3,5-trioxane, (3) acetaldehyde and (4) its enol vinyl alcohol, (5) glucose (pyranose form as α--glucopyranose), (6) the flavorant cinnamaldehyde, (7) retinal, which forms with opsins photoreceptors, and (8) the vitamin pyridoxal.

===Naturally occurring aldehydes===
Traces of many aldehydes are found in essential oils and often contribute to their pleasant odours, including cinnamaldehyde, cilantro, and vanillin. Possibly due to the high reactivity of the formyl group, aldehydes are not commonly found in organic &quot;building block&quot; molecules, such as amino acids, nucleic acids, and lipids. However, most sugars are derivatives of aldehydes. These aldoses exist as hemiacetals, a sort of masked form of the parent aldehyde. For example, in aqueous solution only a tiny fraction of glucose exists as the aldehyde.

==Synthesis==

===Hydroformylation===
Of the several methods for preparing aldehydes, one dominant technology is hydroformylation. Hydroformylation is conducted on a very large scale for diverse aldehydes. It involves treatment of the alkene with a mixture of hydrogen gas and carbon monoxide in the presence of a metal catalyst. Illustrative is the generation of butyraldehyde by hydroformylation of propylene:
One complication with this process is the formation of isomers, such as isobutyraldehyde:

===Oxidative routes===
The largest operations involve methanol and ethanol respectively to formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, which are produced on multimillion ton scale annually. Other large scale aldehydes are produced by autoxidation of hydrocarbons: benzaldehyde from toluene, acrolein from propylene, and methacrolein from isobutene. In the Wacker process, oxidation of ethylene to acetaldehyde in the presence of copper and palladium catalysts, is also used. &quot;Green&quot; and cheap oxygen (or air) is the oxidant of choice.

Laboratories may instead apply a wide variety of specialized oxidizing agents, which are often consumed stoichiometrically. chromium(VI) reagents are popular. Oxidation can be achieved by heating the alcohol with an acidified solution of potassium dichromate. In this case, excess dichromate will further oxidize the aldehyde to a carboxylic acid, so either the aldehyde is distilled out as it forms (if volatile) or milder reagents such as PCC are used.

A variety of reagent systems achieve aldehydes under chromium-free conditions. One such are the hypervalent organoiodine compounds (i.e., IBX acid, Dess–Martin periodinane), although these often also oxidize the α position. A Lux-Flood acid will activate other pre-oxidized substrates: various sulfoxides (e.g. the Swern oxidation), or amine oxides (e.g., the Ganem oxidation). Sterically-hindered nitroxyls (i.e., TEMPO) can catalyze aldehyde formation with a cheaper oxidant.

Alternatively, vicinal diols or their oxidized sequelae (acyloins or α-hydroxy acids) can be oxidized with cleavage to two aldehydes or an aldehyde and carbon dioxide.

===Specialty methods===
==Common reactions==
Aldehydes participate in many reactions. From the industrial perspective, important reactions are:
* condensations, e.g., to prepare plasticizers and polyols, and
* reduction to produce alcohols, especially &quot;oxo-alcohols&quot;. From the biological perspective, the key reactions involve addition of nucleophiles to the formyl carbon in the formation of imines (oxidative deamination) and hemiacetals (structures of aldose sugars).

===Acid-base reactions===
Because of resonance stabilization of the conjugate base, an α-hydrogen in an aldehyde is weakly acidic with a p&quot;K&quot;a near 17. Note, however, this is much more acidic than an alkane or ether hydrogen, which has p&quot;K&quot;a near 50 approximately, and is even more acidic than a ketone α-hydrogen which has p&quot;K&quot;a near 20. This acidification of the α-hydrogen in aldehyde is attributed to:
* the electron-withdrawing quality of the formyl center and
* the fact that the conjugate base, an enolate anion, delocalizes its negative charge.
The formyl proton itself does not readily undergo deprotonation.

===Enolization===
Aldehydes (except those without an alpha carbon, or without protons on the alpha carbon, such as formaldehyde and benzaldehyde) can exist in either the keto or the enol tautomer. Keto–enol tautomerism is catalyzed by either acid or base. In neutral solution, the enol is the minority tautomer, reversing several times per second. But it becomes the dominant tautomer in strong acid or base solutions, and enolized aldehydes undergo nucleophilic attack at the α position.

===Reduction===

The formyl group can be readily reduced to a primary alcohol (). Typically this conversion is accomplished by catalytic hydrogenation either directly or by transfer hydrogenation. Stoichiometric reductions are also popular, as can be effected with sodium borohydride.

===Oxidation===
The formyl group readily oxidizes to the corresponding carboxyl group (). The preferred oxidant in industry is oxygen or air. In the laboratory, popular oxidizing agents include potassium permanganate, nitric acid, chromium(VI) oxide, and chromic acid. The combination of manganese dioxide, cyanide, acetic acid and methanol will convert the aldehyde to a methyl ester.

Another oxidation reaction is the basis of the &quot;silver-mirror test&quot;. In this test, an aldehyde is treated with Tollens&#x27; reagent, which is prepared by adding a drop of sodium hydroxide solution into silver nitrate solution to give a precipitate of silver(I) oxide, and then adding just enough dilute ammonia solution to redissolve the precipitate in aqueous ammonia to produce complex. This reagent converts aldehydes to carboxylic acids without attacking carbon–carbon double bonds. The name &quot;silver-mirror test&quot; arises because this reaction produces a precipitate of silver, whose presence can be used to test for the presence of an aldehyde.

A further oxidation reaction involves Fehling&#x27;s reagent as a test. The complex ions are reduced to a red-brick-coloured precipitate.

If the aldehyde cannot form an enolate (e.g., benzaldehyde), addition of strong base induces the Cannizzaro reaction. This reaction results in disproportionation, producing a mixture of alcohol and carboxylic acid.

===Nucleophilic addition reactions===
Nucleophiles add readily to the carbonyl group. In the product, the carbonyl carbon becomes sp3-hybridized, being bonded to the nucleophile, and the oxygen center becomes protonated:
:

In many cases, a water molecule is removed after the addition takes place; in this case, the reaction is classed as an addition–elimination or addition–condensation reaction. There are many variations of nucleophilic addition reactions.

====Oxygen nucleophiles====
In the acetalisation reaction, under acidic or basic conditions, an alcohol adds to the carbonyl group and a proton is transferred to form a hemiacetal. Under acidic conditions, the hemiacetal and the alcohol can further react to form an acetal and water. Simple hemiacetals are usually unstable, although cyclic ones such as glucose can be stable. Acetals are stable, but revert to the aldehyde in the presence of acid. Aldehydes can react with water to form hydrates, . These diols are stable when strong electron withdrawing groups are present, as in chloral hydrate. The mechanism of formation is identical to hemiacetal formation.

Another aldehyde molecule can also act as the nucleophile to give polymeric or oligomeric acetals called paraldehydes.

====Nitrogen nucleophiles====
In alkylimino-de-oxo-bisubstitution, a primary or secondary amine adds to the carbonyl group and a proton is transferred from the nitrogen to the oxygen atom to create a carbinolamine. In the case of a primary amine, a water molecule can be eliminated from the carbinolamine intermediate to yield an imine or its trimer, a hexahydrotriazine This reaction is catalyzed by acid. Hydroxylamine () can also add to the carbonyl group. After the elimination of water, this results in an oxime. An ammonia derivative of the form such as hydrazine () or 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine can also be the nucleophile and after the elimination of water, resulting in the formation of a hydrazone, which are usually orange crystalline solids. This reaction forms the basis of a test for aldehydes and ketones.

====Carbon nucleophiles====
The cyano group in HCN can add to the carbonyl group to form cyanohydrins, . In this reaction the ion is the nucleophile that attacks the partially positive carbon atom of the carbonyl group. The mechanism involves a pair of electrons from the carbonyl-group double bond transferring to the oxygen atom, leaving it single-bonded to carbon and giving the oxygen atom a negative charge. This intermediate ion rapidly reacts with , such as from the HCN molecule, to form the alcohol group of the cyanohydrin.

Organometallic compounds, such as organolithium reagents, Grignard reagents, or acetylides, undergo nucleophilic addition reactions, yielding a substituted alcohol group. Related reactions include organostannane additions, Barbier reactions, and the Nozaki–Hiyama–Kishi reaction.

In the aldol reaction, the metal enolates of ketones, esters, amides, and carboxylic acids add to aldehydes to form β-hydroxycarbonyl compounds (aldols). Acid or base-catalyzed dehydration then leads to α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The combination of these two steps is known as the aldol condensation.

The Prins reaction occurs when a nucleophilic alkene or alkyne reacts with an aldehyde as electrophile. The product of the Prins reaction varies with reaction conditions and substrates employed.

====Bisulfite reaction====
Aldehydes characteristically form &quot;addition compounds&quot; with bisulfites:
This reaction is used as a test for aldehydes and is useful for separation or purification of aldehydes.

== Dialdehydes ==

A dialdehyde is an organic chemical compound with two aldehyde groups. The nomenclature of dialdehydes have the ending &quot;-dial&quot; or sometimes &quot;-dialdehyde&quot;. Short aliphatic dialdehydes are sometimes named after the diacid from which they can be derived. An example is butanedial, which is also called succinaldehyde (from succinic acid).

==Biochemistry==
Some aldehydes are substrates for aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes which metabolize aldehydes in the body. There are toxicities associated with some aldehydes that are related to neurodegenerative disease, heart disease, and some types of cancer.

==Examples of aldehydes==
* Formaldehyde (methanal)
* Acetaldehyde (ethanal)
* Propionaldehyde (propanal)
* Butyraldehyde (butanal)
* Isovaleraldehyde 
* Benzaldehyde (phenylmethanal)
* Cinnamaldehyde
* Vanillin
* Tolualdehyde
* Furfural
* Retinaldehyde
*Glycolaldehyde

==Examples of dialdehydes==
* Glutaraldehyde
* Glyoxal
* Malondialdehyde
* Phthalaldehyde
* Succindialdehyde

==Uses==
Of all aldehydes, formaldehyde is produced on the largest scale, about . It is mainly used in the production of resins when combined with urea, melamine, and phenol (e.g., Bakelite). It is a precursor to methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (&quot;MDI&quot;), a precursor to polyurethanes. The second main aldehyde is butyraldehyde, of which about are prepared by hydroformylation. It is the principal precursor to 2-ethylhexanol, which is used as a plasticizer. Acetaldehyde once was a dominating product, but production levels have declined to less than because it mainly served as a precursor to acetic acid, which is now prepared by carbonylation of methanol. Many other aldehydes find commercial applications, often as precursors to alcohols, the so-called oxo alcohols, which are used in detergents. Some aldehydes are produced only on a small scale (less than 1000 tons per year) and are used as ingredients in flavours and perfumes such as Chanel No. 5. These include cinnamaldehyde and its derivatives, citral, and lilial.

==Nomenclature==

===IUPAC names for aldehydes===
The common names for aldehydes do not strictly follow official guidelines, such as those recommended by IUPAC, but these rules are useful. IUPAC prescribes the following nomenclature for aldehydes:
# Acyclic aliphatic aldehydes are named as derivatives of the longest carbon chain containing the aldehyde group. Thus, HCHO is named as a derivative of methane, and is named as a derivative of butane. The name is formed by changing the suffix &quot;-e&quot; of the parent alkane to &quot;-al&quot;, so that HCHO is named &quot;methanal&quot;, and is named &quot;butanal&quot;.
# In other cases, such as when a group is attached to a ring, the suffix &quot;-carbaldehyde&quot; may be used. Thus, is known as &quot;cyclohexanecarbaldehyde&quot;. If the presence of another functional group demands the use of a suffix, the aldehyde group is named with the prefix &quot;formyl-&quot;. This prefix is preferred to &quot;methanoyl-&quot;.
# If the compound is a natural product or a carboxylic acid, the prefix &quot;oxo-&quot; may be used to indicate which carbon atom is part of the aldehyde group; for example, is named &quot;2-oxoethanoic acid&quot;.
# If replacing the aldehyde group with a carboxyl group () would yield a carboxylic acid with a trivial name, the aldehyde may be named by replacing the suffix &quot;-ic acid&quot; or &quot;-oic acid&quot; in this trivial name by &quot;-aldehyde&quot;.

===Etymology===
The word &quot;aldehyde&quot; was coined by Justus von Liebig as a contraction of the Latin (dehydrogenated alcohol). In the past, aldehydes were sometimes named after the corresponding alcohols, for example, &quot;vinous aldehyde&quot; for acetaldehyde. (&quot;Vinous&quot; is from Latin &quot;wine&quot;, the traditional source of ethanol, cognate with &quot;vinyl&quot;.)

The term &quot;formyl group&quot; is derived from the Latin word &quot;ant&quot;. This word can be recognized in the simplest aldehyde, formaldehyde, and in the simplest carboxylic acid, formic acid.

<doc id="37332" wikidata="Q153243" url="?curid=37332" title="Josiah Willard Gibbs">
<text>Josiah Willard Gibbs (; February 11, 1839 – April 28, 1903) was an American scientist who made significant theoretical contributions to physics, chemistry, and mathematics. His work on the applications of thermodynamics was instrumental in transforming physical chemistry into a rigorous deductive science. Together with James Clerk Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann, he created statistical mechanics (a term that he coined), explaining the laws of thermodynamics as consequences of the statistical properties of ensembles of the possible states of a physical system composed of many particles. Gibbs also worked on the application of Maxwell&#x27;s equations to problems in physical optics. As a mathematician, he created modern vector calculus (independently of the British scientist Oliver Heaviside, who carried out similar work during the same period) and described the Gibbs phenomenon in the theory of Fourier analysis.

In 1863, Yale University awarded Gibbs the first American doctorate in engineering. After a three-year sojourn in Europe, Gibbs spent the rest of his career at Yale, where he was a professor of mathematical physics from 1871 until his death in 1903. Working in relative isolation, he became the earliest theoretical scientist in the United States to earn an international reputation and was praised by Albert Einstein as &quot;the greatest mind in American history&quot;. In 1901, Gibbs received what was then considered the highest honor awarded by the international scientific community, the Copley Medal of the Royal Society of London, &quot;for his contributions to mathematical physics&quot;.

Commentators and biographers have remarked on the contrast between Gibbs&#x27;s quiet, solitary life in turn of the century New England and the great international impact of his ideas. Though his work was almost entirely theoretical, the practical value of Gibbs&#x27;s contributions became evident with the development of industrial chemistry during the first half of the 20th century. According to Robert A. Millikan, in pure science, Gibbs &quot;did for statistical mechanics and thermodynamics what Laplace did for celestial mechanics and Maxwell did for electrodynamics, namely, made his field a well-nigh finished theoretical structure&quot;.

== Biography ==

=== Family background ===
Gibbs was born in New Haven, Connecticut. He belonged to an old Yankee family that had produced distinguished American clergymen and academics since the 17th century. He was the fourth of five children and the only son of Josiah Willard Gibbs Sr., and his wife Mary Anna, &quot;née&quot; Van Cleve. On his father&#x27;s side, he was descended from Samuel Willard, who served as acting President of Harvard College from 1701 to 1707. On his mother&#x27;s side, one of his ancestors was the Rev. Jonathan Dickinson, the first president of the College of New Jersey (later Princeton University). Gibbs&#x27;s given name, which he shared with his father and several other members of his extended family, derived from his ancestor Josiah Willard, who had been Secretary of the Province of Massachusetts Bay in the 18th century. His paternal grandmother, Mercy (Prescott) Gibbs, was the sister of Rebecca Minot Prescott Sherman, the wife of American founding father Roger Sherman; and he was the second cousin of Roger Sherman Baldwin, see the Amistad case below.

The elder Gibbs was generally known to his family and colleagues as &quot;Josiah&quot;, while the son was called &quot;Willard&quot;. Josiah Gibbs was a linguist and theologian who served as professor of sacred literature at Yale Divinity School from 1824 until his death in 1861. He is chiefly remembered today as the abolitionist who found an interpreter for the African passengers of the ship &quot;Amistad&quot;, allowing them to testify during the trial that followed their rebellion against being sold as slaves.

=== Education ===

Willard Gibbs was educated at the Hopkins School and entered Yale College in 1854 at the age of 15. At Yale, Gibbs received prizes for excellence in mathematics and Latin, and he graduated in 1858, near the top of his class. He remained at Yale as a graduate student at the Sheffield Scientific School. At age 19, soon after his graduation from college, Gibbs was inducted into the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, a scholarly institution composed primarily of members of the Yale faculty.

Relatively few documents from the period survive and it is difficult to reconstruct the details of Gibbs&#x27;s early career with precision. In the opinion of biographers, Gibbs&#x27;s principal mentor and champion, both at Yale and in the Connecticut Academy, was probably the astronomer and mathematician Hubert Anson Newton, a leading authority on meteors, who remained Gibbs&#x27;s lifelong friend and confidant. After the death of his father in 1861, Gibbs inherited enough money to make him financially independent.

Recurrent pulmonary trouble ailed the young Gibbs and his physicians were concerned that he might be susceptible to tuberculosis, which had killed his mother. He also suffered from astigmatism, whose treatment was then still largely unfamiliar to oculists, so that Gibbs had to diagnose himself and grind his own lenses. Though in later years he used glasses only for reading or other close work, Gibbs&#x27;s delicate health and imperfect eyesight probably explain why he did not volunteer to fight in the Civil War of 1861–65. He was not conscripted and he remained at Yale for the duration of the war.

In 1863, Gibbs received the first Doctorate of Philosophy (PhD) in engineering granted in the US, for a thesis entitled &quot;On the Form of the Teeth of Wheels in Spur Gearing&quot;, in which he used geometrical techniques to investigate the optimum design for gears. In 1861, Yale had become the first US university to offer a PhD degree and Gibbs&#x27;s was only the fifth PhD granted in the US in any subject.

=== Career, 1863–1873 ===

After graduation, Gibbs was appointed as tutor at the college for a term of three years. During the first two years, he taught Latin, and during the third year, he taught &quot;natural philosophy&quot; (i.e., physics). In 1866, he patented a design for a railway brake and read a paper before the Connecticut Academy, entitled &quot;The Proper Magnitude of the Units of Length&quot;, in which he proposed a scheme for rationalizing the system of units of measurement used in mechanics.

After his term as tutor ended, Gibbs traveled to Europe with his sisters. They spent the winter of 1866–67 in Paris, where Gibbs attended lectures at the Sorbonne and the , given by such distinguished mathematical scientists as Joseph Liouville and Michel Chasles. Having undertaken a punishing regimen of study, Gibbs caught a serious cold and a doctor, fearing tuberculosis, advised him to rest on the Riviera, where he and his sisters spent several months and where he made a full recovery.

Moving to Berlin, Gibbs attended the lectures taught by mathematicians Karl Weierstrass and Leopold Kronecker, as well as by chemist Heinrich Gustav Magnus. In August 1867, Gibbs&#x27;s sister Julia was married in Berlin to Addison Van Name, who had been Gibbs&#x27;s classmate at Yale. The newly married couple returned to New Haven, leaving Gibbs and his sister Anna in Germany. In Heidelberg, Gibbs was exposed to the work of physicists Gustav Kirchhoff and Hermann von Helmholtz, and chemist Robert Bunsen. At the time, German academics were the leading authorities in the natural sciences, especially chemistry and thermodynamics.

Gibbs returned to Yale in June 1869 and briefly taught French to engineering students. It was probably also around this time that he worked on a new design for a steam-engine governor, his last significant investigation in mechanical engineering. In 1871, he was appointed Professor of Mathematical Physics at Yale, the first such professorship in the United States. Gibbs, who had independent means and had yet to publish anything, was assigned to teach graduate students exclusively and was hired without salary.

=== Career, 1873–1880 ===
Gibbs published his first work in 1873. His papers on the geometric representation of thermodynamic quantities appeared in the &quot;Transactions of the Connecticut Academy&quot;. These papers introduced the use of different type phase diagrams, which were his favorite aids to the imagination process when doing research, rather than the mechanical models, such as the ones that Maxwell used in constructing his electromagnetic theory, which might not completely represent their corresponding phenomena. Although the journal had few readers capable of understanding Gibbs&#x27;s work, he shared reprints with correspondents in Europe and received an enthusiastic response from James Clerk Maxwell at Cambridge. Maxwell even made, with his own hands, a clay model illustrating Gibbs&#x27;s construct. He then produced two plaster casts of his model and mailed one to Gibbs. That cast is on display at the Yale physics department.

Maxwell included a chapter on Gibbs&#x27;s work in the next edition of his &quot;Theory of Heat&quot;, published in 1875. He explained the usefulness of Gibbs&#x27;s graphical methods in a lecture to the Chemical Society of London and even referred to it in the article on &quot;Diagrams&quot; that he wrote for the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. Prospects of collaboration between him and Gibbs were cut short by Maxwell&#x27;s early death in 1879, aged 48. The joke later circulated in New Haven that &quot;only one man lived who could understand Gibbs&#x27;s papers. That was Maxwell, and now he is dead.&quot;

Gibbs then extended his thermodynamic analysis to multi-phase chemical systems (i.e., to systems composed of more than one form of matter) and considered a variety of concrete applications. He described that research in a monograph titled &quot;On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances&quot;, published by the Connecticut Academy in two parts that appeared respectively in 1875 and 1878. That work, which covers about three hundred pages and contains exactly seven hundred numbered mathematical equations, begins with a quotation from Rudolf Clausius that expresses what would later be called the first and second laws of thermodynamics: &quot;The energy of the world is constant. The entropy of the world tends towards a maximum.&quot;

Gibbs&#x27;s monograph rigorously and ingeniously applied his thermodynamic techniques to the interpretation of physico-chemical phenomena, explaining and relating what had previously been a mass of isolated facts and observations. The work has been described as &quot;the &quot;Principia&quot; of thermodynamics&quot; and as a work of &quot;practically unlimited scope&quot;. It solidly laid the foundation for physical Chemistry. Wilhelm Ostwald, who translated Gibbs&#x27;s monograph into German, referred to Gibbs as the &quot;founder of chemical energetics&quot;. According to modern commentators,
Gibbs continued to work without pay until 1880, when the new Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland offered him a position paying $3,000 per year. In response, Yale offered him an annual salary of $2,000, which he was content to accept.

In 1879, Gibbs derived the Gibbs–Appell equation of motion, rediscovered in 1900 by Paul Émile Appell.

=== Career, 1880–1903 ===
From 1880 to 1884, Gibbs worked on developing the exterior algebra of Hermann Grassmann into a vector calculus well-suited to the needs of physicists. With this object in mind, Gibbs distinguished between the dot and cross products of two vectors and introduced the concept of dyadics. Similar work was carried out independently, and at around the same time, by the British mathematical physicist and engineer Oliver Heaviside. Gibbs sought to convince other physicists of the convenience of the vectorial approach over the quaternionic calculus of William Rowan Hamilton, which was then widely used by British scientists. This led him, in the early 1890s, to a controversy with Peter Guthrie Tait and others in the pages of &quot;Nature&quot;.

Gibbs&#x27;s lecture notes on vector calculus were privately printed in 1881 and 1884 for the use of his students, and were later adapted by Edwin Bidwell Wilson into a textbook, &quot;Vector Analysis&quot;, published in 1901. That book helped to popularize the &quot;del&quot; notation that is widely used today in electrodynamics and fluid mechanics. In other mathematical work, he re-discovered the &quot;Gibbs phenomenon&quot; in the theory of Fourier series (which, unbeknownst to him and to later scholars, had been described fifty years before by an obscure English mathematician, Henry Wilbraham).

From 1882 to 1889, Gibbs wrote five papers on physical optics, in which he investigated birefringence and other optical phenomena and defended Maxwell&#x27;s electromagnetic theory of light against the mechanical theories of Lord Kelvin and others. In his work on optics, just as much as in his work on thermodynamics, Gibbs deliberately avoided speculating about the microscopic structure of matter and purposefully confined his research problems to those that can be solved from broad general principles and experimentally confirmed facts. The methods that he used were highly original and the obtained results showed decisively the correctness of Maxwell&#x27;s electromagnetic theory.

Gibbs coined the term &quot;statistical mechanics&quot; and introduced key concepts in the corresponding mathematical description of physical systems, including the notions of chemical potential (1876), and statistical ensemble (1902). Gibbs&#x27;s derivation of the laws of thermodynamics from the statistical properties of systems consisting of many particles was presented in his highly influential textbook &quot;Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics&quot;, published in 1902, a year before his death.

Gibbs&#x27;s retiring personality and intense focus on his work limited his accessibility to students. His principal protégé was Edwin Bidwell Wilson, who nonetheless explained that &quot;except in the classroom I saw very little of Gibbs. He had a way, toward the end of the afternoon, of taking a stroll about the streets between his study in the old Sloane Laboratory and his home—a little exercise between work and dinner—and one might occasionally come across him at that time.&quot; Gibbs did supervise the doctoral thesis on mathematical economics written by Irving Fisher in 1891. After Gibbs&#x27;s death, Fisher financed the publication of his &quot;Collected Works&quot;. Another distinguished student was Lee De Forest, later a pioneer of radio technology.

Gibbs died in New Haven on April 28, 1903, at the age of 64, the victim of an acute intestinal obstruction. A funeral was conducted two days later at his home on 121 High Street, and his body was buried in the nearby Grove Street Cemetery. In May, Yale organized a memorial meeting at the Sloane Laboratory. The eminent British physicist J. J. Thomson was in attendance and delivered a brief address.

=== Personal life and character ===
Gibbs never married, living all his life in his childhood home with his sister Julia and her husband Addison Van Name, who was the Yale librarian. Except for his customary summer vacations in the Adirondacks (at Keene Valley, New York) and later at the White Mountains (in Intervale, New Hampshire), his sojourn in Europe in 1866–1869 was almost the only time that Gibbs spent outside New Haven. He joined Yale&#x27;s College Church (a Congregational church) at the end of his freshman year and remained a regular attendant for the rest of his life. Gibbs generally voted for the Republican candidate in presidential elections but, like other &quot;Mugwumps&quot;, his concern over the growing corruption associated with machine politics led him to support Grover Cleveland, a conservative Democrat, in the election of 1884. Little else is known of his religious or political views, which he mostly kept to himself.

Gibbs did not produce a substantial personal correspondence, and many of his letters were later lost or destroyed. Beyond the technical writings concerning his research, he published only two other pieces: a brief obituary for Rudolf Clausius, one of the founders of the mathematical theory of thermodynamics, and a longer biographical memoir of his mentor at Yale, H. A. Newton. In Edward Bidwell Wilson&#x27;s view,
According to Lynde Wheeler, who had been Gibbs&#x27;s student at Yale, in his later years Gibbs
He was a careful investor and financial manager, and at his death in 1903 his estate was valued at $100,000 (roughly $ today). For many years, he served as trustee, secretary, and treasurer of his alma mater, the Hopkins School. US President Chester A. Arthur appointed him as one of the commissioners to the National Conference of Electricians, which convened in Philadelphia in September 1884, and Gibbs presided over one of its sessions. A keen and skilled horseman, Gibbs was seen habitually in New Haven driving his sister&#x27;s carriage. In an obituary published in the &quot;American Journal of Science&quot;, Gibbs&#x27;s former student Henry A. Bumstead referred to Gibbs&#x27;s personal character:
== Major scientific contributions ==

=== Chemical and electrochemical thermodynamics ===
Gibbs&#x27;s papers from the 1870s introduced the idea of expressing the internal energy &quot;U&quot; of a system in terms of the entropy &quot;S&quot;, in addition to the usual state variables of volume &quot;V&quot;, pressure &quot;p&quot;, and temperature &quot;T&quot;. He also introduced the concept of the chemical potential formula_1 of a given chemical species, defined to be the rate of the increase in &quot;U&quot; associated with the increase in the number &quot;N&quot; of molecules of that species (at constant entropy and volume). Thus, it was Gibbs who first combined the first and second laws of thermodynamics by expressing the infinitesimal change in the internal energy, d&quot;U&quot;, of a closed system in the form
: formula_2
where &quot;T&quot; is the absolute temperature, &quot;p&quot; is the pressure, d&quot;S&quot; is an infinitesimal change in entropy and d&quot;V&quot; is an infinitesimal change of volume. The last term is the sum, over all the chemical species in a chemical reaction, of the chemical potential, &quot;μ&quot;i, of the &quot;i&quot;-th species, multiplied by the infinitesimal change in the number of moles, d&quot;N&quot;i of that species. By taking the Legendre transform of this expression, he defined the concepts of enthalpy &quot;H&quot; and Gibbs free energy &quot;G&quot;:
: formula_3
This compares to the expression for Helmholtz free energy &quot;A&quot;:
: formula_4

When the Gibbs free energy for a chemical reaction is negative, the reaction will proceed spontaneously. When a chemical system is at equilibrium, the change in Gibbs free energy is zero. An equilibrium constant is simply related to the free energy change when the reactants are in their standard states:
: formula_5
Chemical potential is usually defined as partial molar Gibbs free energy:
: formula_6

Gibbs also obtained what later came to be known as the &quot;Gibbs–Duhem equation&quot;.

In an electrochemical reaction characterized by an electromotive force ℰ and an amount of transferred charge &quot;Q&quot;, Gibbs&#x27;s starting equation becomes 
: formula_7
The publication of the paper &quot;On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances&quot; (1874–1878) is now regarded as a landmark in the development of chemistry. In it, Gibbs developed a rigorous mathematical theory for various transport phenomena, including adsorption, electrochemistry, and the Marangoni effect in fluid mixtures. He also formulated the phase rule
: formula_8
for the number &quot;F&quot; of variables that may be independently controlled in an equilibrium mixture of &quot;C&quot; components existing in &quot;P&quot; phases. The phase rule is very useful in diverse areas, such as metallurgy, mineralogy, and petrology. It can also be applied to various research problems in physical chemistry.

=== Statistical mechanics ===

Together with James Clerk Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann, Gibbs founded &quot;statistical mechanics&quot;, a term that he coined to identify the branch of theoretical physics that accounts for the observed thermodynamic properties of systems in terms of the statistics of ensembles of all possible physical states of a system composed of many particles. He introduced the concept of &quot;phase of a mechanical system&quot;. He used the concept to define the microcanonical, canonical, and grand canonical ensembles; all related to the Gibbs measure, thus obtaining a more general formulation of the statistical properties of many-particle systems than Maxwell and Boltzmann had achieved before him.

Gibbs generalized Boltzmann&#x27;s statistical interpretation of entropy formula_9 by defining the entropy of an arbitrary ensemble as
: formula_10
where formula_11 is the Boltzmann constant, while the sum is over all possible microstates formula_12, with formula_13 the corresponding probability of the microstate (see Gibbs entropy formula). This same formula would later play a central role in Claude Shannon&#x27;s information theory and is therefore often seen as the basis of the modern information-theoretical interpretation of thermodynamics.

According to Henri Poincaré, writing in 1904, even though Maxwell and Boltzmann had previously explained the irreversibility of macroscopic physical processes in probabilistic terms, &quot;the one who has seen it most clearly, in a book too little read because it is a little difficult to read, is Gibbs, in his &quot;Elementary Principles of Statistical Mechanics&quot;&quot;. Gibbs&#x27;s analysis of irreversibility, and his formulation of Boltzmann&#x27;s H-theorem and of the ergodic hypothesis, were major influences on the mathematical physics of the 20th century.

Gibbs was well aware that the application of the equipartition theorem to large systems of classical particles failed to explain the measurements of the specific heats of both solids and gases, and he argued that this was evidence of the danger of basing thermodynamics on &quot;hypotheses about the constitution of matter&quot;. Gibbs&#x27;s own framework for statistical mechanics, based on ensembles of macroscopically indistinguishable microstates, could be carried over almost intact after the discovery that the microscopic laws of nature obey quantum rules, rather than the classical laws known to Gibbs and to his contemporaries. His resolution of the so-called &quot;Gibbs paradox&quot;, about the entropy of the mixing of gases, is now often cited as a prefiguration of the indistinguishability of particles required by quantum physics.

=== Vector analysis ===
British scientists, including Maxwell, had relied on Hamilton&#x27;s quaternions in order to express the dynamics of physical quantities, like the electric and magnetic fields, having both a magnitude and a direction in three-dimensional space. Following W. K. Clifford in his &quot;Elements of Dynamic&quot; (1888), Gibbs noted that the product of quaternions could be separated into two parts: a one-dimensional (scalar) quantity and a three-dimensional vector, so that the use of quaternions involved mathematical complications and redundancies that could be avoided in the interest of simplicity and to facilitate teaching. In his Yale classroom notes he defined distinct dot and cross products for pairs of vectors and introduced the now common notation for them. Through the 1901 textbook &quot;Vector Analysis&quot; prepared by E. B. Wilson from Gibbs notes, he was largely responsible for the development of the vector calculus techniques still used today in electrodynamics and fluid mechanics.

While he was working on vector analysis in the late 1870s, Gibbs discovered that his approach was similar to the one that Grassmann had taken in his &quot;multiple algebra&quot;. Gibbs then sought to publicize Grassmann&#x27;s work, stressing that it was both more general and historically prior to Hamilton&#x27;s quaternionic algebra. To establish priority of Grassmann&#x27;s ideas, Gibbs convinced Grassmann&#x27;s heirs to seek the publication in Germany of the essay &quot;Theorie der Ebbe und Flut&quot; on tides that Grassmann had submitted in 1840 to the faculty at the University of Berlin, in which he had first introduced the notion of what would later be called a vector space (linear space).

As Gibbs had advocated in the 1880s and 1890s, quaternions were eventually all but abandoned by physicists in favor of the vectorial approach developed by him and, independently, by Oliver Heaviside. Gibbs applied his vector methods to the determination of planetary and comet orbits. He also developed the concept of mutually reciprocal triads of vectors that later proved to be of importance in crystallography.

=== Physical optics ===
Though Gibbs&#x27;s research on physical optics is less well known today than his other work, it made a significant contribution to classical electromagnetism by applying Maxwell&#x27;s equations to the theory of optical processes such as birefringence, dispersion, and optical activity. In that work, Gibbs showed that those processes could be accounted for by Maxwell&#x27;s equations without any special assumptions about the microscopic structure of matter or about the nature of the medium in which electromagnetic waves were supposed to propagate (the so-called luminiferous ether). Gibbs also stressed that the absence of a longitudinal electromagnetic wave, which is needed to account for the observed properties of light, is automatically guaranteed by Maxwell&#x27;s equations (by virtue of what is now called their &quot;gauge invariance&quot;), whereas in mechanical theories of light, such as Lord Kelvin&#x27;s, it must be imposed as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; condition on the properties of the aether.

In his last paper on physical optics, Gibbs concluded that

Shortly afterwards, the electromagnetic nature of light was demonstrated by the experiments of Heinrich Hertz in Germany.

== Scientific recognition ==

Gibbs worked at a time when there was little tradition of rigorous theoretical science in the United States. His research was not easily understandable to his students or his colleagues, and he made no effort to popularize his ideas or to simplify their exposition to make them more accessible. His seminal work on thermodynamics was published mostly in the &quot;Transactions of the Connecticut Academy&quot;, a journal edited by his librarian brother-in-law, which was little read in the US and even less so in Europe. When Gibbs submitted his long paper on the equilibrium of heterogeneous substances to the academy, both Elias Loomis and H. A. Newton protested that they did not understand Gibbs&#x27;s work at all, but they helped to raise the money needed to pay for the typesetting of the many mathematical symbols in the paper. Several Yale faculty members, as well as business and professional men in New Haven, contributed funds for that purpose.

Even though it had been immediately embraced by Maxwell, Gibbs&#x27;s graphical formulation of the laws of thermodynamics came into widespread use only in the mid 20th century, with the work of László Tisza and Herbert Callen. According to James Gerald Crowther,

On the other hand, Gibbs did receive the major honors then possible for an academic scientist in the US. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1879 and received the 1880 Rumford Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences for his work on chemical thermodynamics. In 1895, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1895. He was also awarded honorary doctorates by Princeton University and Williams College.

In Europe, Gibbs was inducted as honorary member of the London Mathematical Society in 1892 and elected Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1897. He was elected as corresponding member of the Prussian and French Academies of Science and received honorary doctorates from the universities of Dublin, Erlangen, and Christiania (now Oslo). The Royal Society further honored Gibbs in 1901 with the Copley Medal, then regarded as the highest international award in the natural sciences, noting that he had been &quot;the first to apply the second law of thermodynamics to the exhaustive discussion of the relation between chemical, electrical and thermal energy and capacity for external work.&quot; Gibbs, who remained in New Haven, was represented at the award ceremony by Commander Richardson Clover, the US naval attaché in London.

In his autobiography, mathematician Gian-Carlo Rota tells of casually browsing the mathematical stacks of Sterling Library and stumbling on a handwritten mailing list, attached to some of Gibbs&#x27;s course notes, which listed over two hundred notable scientists of his day, including Poincaré, Boltzmann, David Hilbert, and Ernst Mach. From this, Rota concluded that Gibbs&#x27;s work was better known among the scientific elite of his day than the published material suggests. Lynde Wheeler reproduces that mailing list in an appendix to his biography of Gibbs. That Gibbs succeeded in interesting his European correspondents in his work is demonstrated by the fact that his monograph &quot;On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances&quot; was translated into German (then the leading language for chemistry) by Wilhelm Ostwald in 1892 and into French by Henri Louis Le Châtelier in 1899.

== Influence ==
Gibbs&#x27;s most immediate and obvious influence was on physical chemistry and statistical mechanics, two disciplines which he greatly helped to found. During Gibbs&#x27;s lifetime, his phase rule was experimentally validated by Dutch chemist H. W. Bakhuis Roozeboom, who showed how to apply it in a variety of situations, thereby assuring it of widespread use. In industrial chemistry, Gibbs&#x27;s thermodynamics found many applications during the early 20th century, from electrochemistry to the development of the Haber process for the synthesis of ammonia.

When Dutch physicist J. D. van der Waals received the 1910 Nobel Prize &quot;for his work on the equation of state for gases and liquids&quot; he acknowledged the great influence of Gibbs&#x27;s work on that subject. Max Planck received the 1918 Nobel Prize for his work on quantum mechanics, particularly his 1900 paper on Planck&#x27;s law for quantized black-body radiation. That work was based largely on the thermodynamics of Kirchhoff, Boltzmann, and Gibbs. Planck declared that Gibbs&#x27;s name &quot;not only in America but in the whole world will ever be reckoned among the most renowned theoretical physicists of all times.&quot;

The first half of the 20th century saw the publication of two influential textbooks that soon came to be regarded as founding documents of chemical thermodynamics, both of which used and extended Gibbs&#x27;s work in that field: these were &quot;Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Processes&quot; (1923), by Gilbert N. Lewis and Merle Randall, and &quot;Modern Thermodynamics by the Methods of Willard Gibbs&quot; (1933), by Edward A. Guggenheim.

Gibbs&#x27;s work on statistical ensembles, as presented in his 1902 textbook, has had a great impact in both theoretical physics and in pure mathematics. According to mathematical physicist Arthur Wightman,

Initially unaware of Gibbs&#x27;s contributions in that field, Albert Einstein wrote three papers on statistical mechanics, published between 1902 and 1904. After reading Gibbs&#x27;s textbook (which was translated into German by Ernst Zermelo in 1905), Einstein declared that Gibbs&#x27;s treatment was superior to his own and explained that he would not have written those papers if he had known Gibbs&#x27;s work.

Gibbs&#x27;s early papers on the use of graphical methods in thermodynamics reflect a powerfully original understanding of what mathematicians would later call &quot;convex analysis&quot;, including ideas that, according to Barry Simon, &quot;lay dormant for about seventy-five years&quot;. Important mathematical concepts based on Gibbs&#x27;s work on thermodynamics and statistical mechanics include the Gibbs lemma in game theory, the Gibbs inequality in information theory, as well as Gibbs sampling in computational statistics.

The development of vector calculus was Gibbs&#x27;s other great contribution to mathematics. The publication in 1901 of E. B. Wilson&#x27;s textbook &quot;Vector Analysis&quot;, based on Gibbs&#x27;s lectures at Yale, did much to propagate the use of vectorial methods and notation in both mathematics and theoretical physics, definitively displacing the quaternions that had until then been dominant in the scientific literature.

At Yale, Gibbs was also mentor to Lee De Forest, who went on to invent the triode amplifier and has been called the &quot;father of radio&quot;. De Forest credited Gibbs&#x27;s influence for the realization &quot;that the leaders in electrical development would be those who pursued the higher theory of waves and oscillations and the transmission by these means of intelligence and power.&quot; Another student of Gibbs who played a significant role in the development of radio technology was Lynde Wheeler.

Gibbs also had an indirect influence on mathematical economics. He supervised the thesis of Irving Fisher, who received the first PhD in economics from Yale in 1891. In that work, published in 1892 as &quot;Mathematical Investigations in the Theory of Value and Prices&quot;, Fisher drew a direct analogy between Gibbsian equilibrium in physical and chemical systems, and the general equilibrium of markets, and he used Gibbs&#x27;s vectorial notation. Gibbs&#x27;s protégé Edwin Bidwell Wilson became, in turn, a mentor to leading American economist and Nobel Laureate Paul Samuelson. In 1947, Samuelson published &quot;Foundations of Economic Analysis&quot;, based on his doctoral dissertation, in which he used as epigraph a remark attributed to Gibbs: &quot;Mathematics is a language.&quot; Samuelson later explained that in his understanding of prices his &quot;debts were not primarily to Pareto or Slutsky, but to the great thermodynamicist, Willard Gibbs of Yale.&quot;

Mathematician Norbert Wiener cited Gibbs&#x27;s use of probability in the formulation of statistical mechanics as &quot;the first great revolution of twentieth century physics&quot; and as a major influence on his conception of cybernetics. Wiener explained in the preface to his book &quot;The Human Use of Human Beings&quot; that it was &quot;devoted to the impact of the Gibbsian point of view on modern life, both through the substantive changes it has made to working science, and through the changes it has made indirectly in our attitude to life in general.&quot;

== Commemoration ==
When the German physical chemist Walther Nernst visited Yale in 1906 to give the Silliman lecture, he was surprised to find no tangible memorial for Gibbs. Nernst donated his $500 lecture fee to the university to help pay for a suitable monument. This was finally unveiled in 1912, in the form of a bronze bas-relief by sculptor Lee Lawrie, installed in the Sloane Physics Laboratory. In 1910, the American Chemical Society established the Willard Gibbs Award for eminent work in pure or applied chemistry. In 1923, the American Mathematical Society endowed the Josiah Willard Gibbs Lectureship, &quot;to show the public some idea of the aspects of mathematics and its applications&quot;.

In 1945, Yale University created the J. Willard Gibbs Professorship in Theoretical Chemistry, held until 1973 by Lars Onsager. Onsager, who much like Gibbs, focused on applying new mathematical ideas to problems in physical chemistry, won the 1968 Nobel Prize in chemistry. In addition to establishing the Josiah Willard Gibbs Laboratories and the J. Willard Gibbs Assistant Professorship in Mathematics, Yale has also hosted two symposia dedicated to Gibbs&#x27;s life and work, one in 1989 and another on the centenary of his death, in 2003. Rutgers University endowed a J. Willard Gibbs Professorship of Thermomechanics, held as of 2014 by Bernard Coleman.

Gibbs was elected in 1950 to the Hall of Fame for Great Americans. The oceanographic research ship USNS &quot;Josiah Willard Gibbs&quot; (T-AGOR-1) was in service with the United States Navy from 1958 to 1971. Gibbs crater, near the eastern limb of the Moon, was named in the scientist&#x27;s honor in 1964.

Edward Guggenheim introduced the symbol &quot;G&quot; for the Gibbs free energy in 1933, and this was used also by Dirk ter Haar in 1966. This notation is now universal and is recommended by the IUPAC. In 1960, William Giauque and others suggested the name &quot;gibbs&quot; (abbreviated gbs.) for the unit of entropy calorie per kelvin, but this usage did not become common, and the corresponding SI unit joule per kelvin carries no special name.

In 1954, a year before his death, Albert Einstein was asked by an interviewer who were the greatest thinkers that he had known. Einstein replied: &quot;Lorentz&quot;, adding &quot;I never met Willard Gibbs; perhaps, had I done so, I might have placed him beside Lorentz.&quot; Author Bill Bryson in his bestselling popular science book &quot;A Short History of Nearly Everything&quot; ranks Gibbs as &quot;perhaps the most brilliant person that most people have never heard of&quot;.

In 1958, USS &quot;San Carlos&quot; was renamed USNS &quot;Josiah Willard Gibbs&quot; and re-designated as an oceanographic research ship.

=== In literature ===
In 1909, the American historian and novelist Henry Adams finished an essay entitled &quot;The Rule of Phase Applied to History&quot;, in which he sought to apply Gibbs&#x27;s phase rule and other thermodynamic concepts to a general theory of human history. William James, Henry Bumstead, and others criticized both Adams&#x27;s tenuous grasp of the scientific concepts that he invoked, as well as the arbitrariness of his application of those concepts as metaphors for the evolution of human thought and society. The essay remained unpublished until it appeared posthumously in 1919, in &quot;The Degradation of the Democratic Dogma&quot;, edited by Henry Adams&#x27;s younger brother Brooks.

In the 1930s, feminist poet Muriel Rukeyser became fascinated by Willard Gibbs and wrote a long poem about his life and work (&quot;Gibbs&quot;, included in the collection &quot;A Turning Wind&quot;, published in 1939), as well as a book-length biography (&quot;Willard Gibbs&quot;, 1942). According to Rukeyser:

In 1946, &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine illustrated a cover story on &quot;Fundamental Science&quot; with a representation of the thermodynamic surface that Maxwell had built based on Gibbs&#x27;s proposal. Rukeyser called this surface a &quot;statue of water&quot; and the magazine saw in it &quot;the abstract creation of a great American scientist that lends itself to the symbolism of contemporary art forms.&quot; The artwork by Arthur Lidov also included Gibbs&#x27;s mathematical expression of the phase rule for heterogeneous mixtures, as well as a radar screen, an oscilloscope waveform, Newton&#x27;s apple, and a small rendition of a three-dimensional phase diagram.

Gibbs&#x27;s nephew, Ralph Gibbs Van Name, a professor of physical chemistry at Yale, was unhappy with Rukeyser&#x27;s biography, in part because of her lack of scientific training. Van Name had withheld the family papers from her and, after her book was published in 1942 to positive literary but mixed scientific reviews, he tried to encourage Gibbs&#x27;s former students to produce a more technically oriented biography. Rukeyser&#x27;s approach to Gibbs was also sharply criticized by Gibbs&#x27;s former student and protégé Edwin Wilson. With Van Name&#x27;s and Wilson&#x27;s encouragement, physicist Lynde Wheeler published a new biography of Gibbs in 1951.

Both Gibbs and Rukeyser&#x27;s biography of him figure prominently in the poetry collection &quot;True North&quot; (1997) by Stephanie Strickland. In fiction, Gibbs appears as the mentor to character Kit Traverse in Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s novel &quot;Against the Day&quot; (2006). That novel also prominently discusses the birefringence of Iceland spar, an optical phenomenon that Gibbs investigated.

=== Gibbs stamp (2005) ===

In 2005, the United States Postal Service issued the &quot;American Scientists&quot; commemorative postage stamp series designed by artist Victor Stabin, depicting Gibbs, John von Neumann, Barbara McClintock, and Richard Feynman. The first day of issue ceremony for the series was held on May 4 at Yale University&#x27;s Luce Hall and was attended by John Marburger, scientific advisor to the president of the United States, Rick Levin, president of Yale, and family members of the scientists honored, including physician John W. Gibbs, a distant cousin of Willard Gibbs.

Kenneth R. Jolls, a professor of chemical engineering at Iowa State University and an expert on graphical methods in thermodynamics, consulted on the design of the stamp honoring Gibbs. The stamp identifies Gibbs as a &quot;thermodynamicist&quot; and features a diagram from the 4th edition of Maxwell&#x27;s &quot;Theory of Heat&quot;, published in 1875, which illustrates Gibbs&#x27;s thermodynamic surface for water. Microprinting on the collar of Gibbs&#x27;s portrait depicts his original mathematical equation for the change in the energy of a substance in terms of its entropy and the other state variables.

<text>A drought is a period of drier-than-normal conditions. A drought can last for days, months or years. Drought often has large impacts on the ecosystems and agriculture of affected regions, and causes harm to the local economy. Annual dry seasons in the tropics significantly increase the chances of a drought developing, with subsequent increased wildfire risks. Heat waves can significantly worsen drought conditions by increasing evapotranspiration. This dries out forests and other vegetation, and increases the amount of fuel for wildfires.

Drought is a recurring feature of the climate in most parts of the world, becoming more extreme and less predictable due to climate change, which dendrochronological studies date back to 1900. There are three kinds of drought effects, environmental, economic and social. Environmental effects include the drying of wetlands, more and larger wildfires, loss of biodiversity.

Economic impacts of drought result due to negative disruptions to agriculture and livestock farming (causing food insecurity), forestry, public water supplies, maritime navigation (due to e.g.: lower water levels), electric power supply (by affecting hydropower systems) and impacts on human health.

Social and health costs include the negative effect on the health of people directly exposed to this phenomenon (excessive heat waves), high food costs, stress caused by failed harvests, water scarcity, etc. Drought can also lead to increased air pollution due to increased dust concentrations and wildfires. Prolonged droughts have caused mass migrations and humanitarian crisis.

Examples for regions with increased drought risks are the Amazon basin, Australia, the Sahel region and India. For example, in 2005, parts of the Amazon basin experienced the worst drought in 100 years. Australia could experience more severe droughts and they could become more frequent in the future, a government-commissioned report said on July 6, 2008. The long Australian Millennial drought broke in 2010. The 2020–2022 Horn of Africa drought has surpassed the horrific drought in 2010–2011 in both duration and severity. More than 150 districts in India are drought vulnerable, mostly concentrated in the state of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and its adjoining Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, northern Karnataka and adjoining Maharashtra of the country.

Throughout history, humans have usually viewed droughts as disasters due to the impact on food availability and the rest of society. People have viewed drought as a natural disaster or as something influenced by human activity, or as a result of supernatural forces.

== Definition ==

The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report defines a drought simply as &quot;drier than normal conditions&quot;. This means that a drought is &quot;a moisture deficit relative to the average water availability at a given location and season&quot;.

According to National Integrated Drought Information System, a multi-agency partnership, drought is generally defined as &quot;a deficiency of precipitation over an extended period of time (usually a season or more), resulting in a water shortage&quot;. The National Weather Service office of the NOAA defines drought as &quot;a deficiency of moisture that results in adverse impacts on people, animals, or vegetation over a sizeable area&quot;.

Drought is a complex phenomenon − relating to the absence of water − which is difficult to monitor and define. By the early 1980s, over 150 definitions of &quot;drought&quot; had already been published. The range of definitions reflects differences in regions, needs, and disciplinary approaches.

== Categories ==
There are three major categories of drought based on where in the water cycle the moisture deficit occurs: meteorological drought, hydrological drought, and agricultural or ecological drought. A meteorological drought occurs due to lack of precipitation. A hydrological drought is related to low runoff, streamflow, and reservoir and groundwater storage. An agricultural or ecological drought is causing plant stress from a combination of evaporation and low soil moisture. Some organizations add another category: socioeconomic drought occurs when the demand for an economic good exceeds supply as a result of a weather-related shortfall in water supply. The socioeconomic drought is a similar concept to water scarcity.

The different categories of droughts have different causes but similar effects:
# Meteorological drought occurs when there is a prolonged time with less than average precipitation. Meteorological drought usually precedes the other kinds of drought. As a drought persists, the conditions surrounding it gradually worsen and its impact on the local population gradually increases.
# Hydrological drought happens when water reserves available in sources such as aquifers, lakes and reservoirs fall below average or a locally significant threshold. Hydrological drought tends to present more slowly because it involves stored water that is used but not replenished. Due to the close interaction with water use, this type of drought is can be heavily influenced by water management. Both positive and negative human influences have been discovered and strategic water management strategies seem key to mitigate drought impact. Like agricultural droughts, hydrological droughts can be triggered by more than just a loss of rainfall. For instance, around 2007 Kazakhstan was awarded a large amount of money by the World Bank to restore water that had been diverted to other nations from the Aral Sea under Soviet rule. Similar circumstances also place their largest lake, Balkhash, at risk of completely drying out.
# Agricultural or ecological droughts affect crop production or ecosystems in general. This condition can also arise independently from any change in precipitation levels when either increased irrigation or soil conditions and erosion triggered by poorly planned agricultural endeavors cause a shortfall in water available to the crops.

== Indices and monitoring ==
Several indices have been defined to quantify and monitor drought at different spatial and temporal scales. A key property of drought indices is their spatial comparability, and they must be statistically robust. Drought indices include:
* Palmer drought index (sometimes called the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI)): a regional drought index commonly used for monitoring drought events and studying areal extent and severity of drought episodes. The index uses precipitation and temperature data to study moisture supply and demand using a simple water balance model.
* Keetch-Byram Drought Index: an index that is calculated based on rainfall, air temperature, and other meteorological factors.
* Standardized precipitation index (SPI): It is computed based on precipitation, which makes it a simple and easy-to-apply indicator for monitoring and prediction of droughts in different parts of the world. The World Meteorological Organization recommends this index for identifying and monitoring meteorological droughts in different climates and time periods.
* Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI): a multiscalar drought index based on climatic data. The SPEI accounts also for the role of the increased atmospheric evaporative demand on drought severity. Evaporative demand is particularly dominant during periods of precipitation deficit. The SPEI calculation requires long-term and high-quality precipitation and atmospheric evaporative demand datasets. These can be obtained from ground stations or gridded data based on reanalysis as well as satellite and multi-source datasets.
* Indices related to vegetation: root-zone soil moisture, vegetation condition index (VDI) and vegetation health index (VHI). The VCI and VHI are computed based on vegetation indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and temperature datasets.
* Deciles index
* Standardized runoff index
High-resolution drought information helps to better assess the spatial and temporal changes and variability in drought duration, severity, and magnitude at a much finer scale. This supports the development of site-specific adaptation measures.

The application of multiple indices using different datasets helps to better manage and monitor droughts than using a single dataset, This is particularly the case in regions of the world where not enough data is available such as Africa and South America. Using a single dataset can be limiting, as it may not capture the full spectrum of drought characteristics and impacts.

Careful monitoring of moisture levels can also help predict increased risk for wildfires.

== Causes ==
=== General precipitation deficiency ===

Mechanisms of producing precipitation include convective, stratiform, and orographic rainfall. Convective processes involve strong vertical motions that can cause the overturning of the atmosphere in that location within an hour and cause heavy precipitation, while stratiform processes involve weaker upward motions and less intense precipitation over a longer duration.

Precipitation can be divided into three categories, based on whether it falls as liquid water, liquid water that freezes on contact with the surface, or ice.

Droughts occur mainly in areas where normal levels of rainfall are, in themselves, low. If these factors do not support precipitation volumes sufficiently to reach the surface over a sufficient time, the result is a drought. Drought can be triggered by a high level of reflected sunlight and above average prevalence of high pressure systems, winds carrying continental, rather than oceanic air masses, and ridges of high pressure areas aloft can prevent or restrict the developing of thunderstorm activity or rainfall over one certain region. Once a region is within drought, feedback mechanisms such as local arid air, hot conditions which can promote warm core ridging, and minimal evapotranspiration can worsen drought conditions.

==== Dry season ====
Within the tropics, distinct, wet and dry seasons emerge due to the movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone or Monsoon trough. The dry season greatly increases drought occurrence, and is characterized by its low humidity, with watering holes and rivers drying up. Because of the lack of these watering holes, many grazing animals are forced to migrate due to the lack of water in search of more fertile lands. Examples of such animals are zebras, elephants, and wildebeest. Because of the lack of water in the plants, bushfires are common. Since water vapor becomes more energetic with increasing temperature, more water vapor is required to increase relative humidity values to 100% at higher temperatures (or to get the temperature to fall to the dew point). Periods of warmth quicken the pace of fruit and vegetable production, increase evaporation and transpiration from plants, and worsen drought conditions.

==== El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) ====

The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon can sometimes play a significant role in drought. ENSO comprises two patterns of temperature anomalies in the central Pacific Ocean, known as La Niña and El Niño. La Niña events are generally associated with drier and hotter conditions and further exacerbation of drought in California and the Southwestern United States, and to some extent the U.S. Southeast. Meteorological scientists have observed that La Niñas have become more frequent over time.

Conversely, during El Niño events, drier and hotter weather occurs in parts of the Amazon River Basin, Colombia, and Central America. Winters during the El Niño are warmer and drier than average conditions in the Northwest, northern Midwest, and northern Mideast United States, so those regions experience reduced snowfalls. Conditions are also drier than normal from December to February in south-central Africa, mainly in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Botswana. Direct effects of El Niño resulting in drier conditions occur in parts of Southeast Asia and Northern Australia, increasing bush fires, worsening haze, and decreasing air quality dramatically. Drier-than-normal conditions are also in general observed in Queensland, inland Victoria, inland New South Wales, and eastern Tasmania from June to August. As warm water spreads from the west Pacific and the Indian Ocean to the east Pacific, it causes extensive drought in the western Pacific. Singapore experienced the driest February in 2014 since records began in 1869, with only 6.3 mm of rain falling in the month and temperatures hitting as high as 35 °C on 26 February. The years 1968 and 2005 had the next driest Februaries, when 8.4 mm of rain fell.

Globally, the occurrence of droughts has increased as a result of the increase in temperature and atmospheric evaporative demand. In addition, increased climate variability has increased the frequency and severity of drought events. Moreover, the occurrence and impact of droughts are aggravated by anthropogenic activities such as land use change and water management and demand.

The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report also pointed out that &quot;Warming over land drives an increase in atmospheric evaporative demand and in the severity of drought events&quot; and &quot;Increased atmospheric evaporative demand increases plant water stress, leading to agricultural and ecological drought&quot;.

There is a rise of compound warm-season droughts in Europe that are concurrent with an increase in potential evapotranspiration.

=== Erosion and human activities ===
Human activity can directly trigger exacerbating factors such as over-farming, excessive irrigation, deforestation, and erosion adversely impact the ability of the land to capture and hold water. In arid climates, the main source of erosion is wind. Erosion can be the result of material movement by the wind. The wind can cause small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region (deflation). Suspended particles within the wind may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion (ecological succession). Wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation, often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation.

== Impacts ==

Drought is one of the most complex and major natural hazards, and it has devastating impacts on the environment, economy, water resources, agriculture, and society worldwide.

One can divide the impacts of droughts and water shortages into three groups: environmental, economic and social (including health).

=== Environmental and economic impacts ===

Environmental effects of droughts include: lower surface and subterranean water-levels, lower flow-levels (with a decrease below the minimum leading to direct danger for amphibian life), increased pollution of surface water, the drying out of wetlands, more and larger wildfires, higher deflation intensity, loss of biodiversity, worse health of trees and the appearance of pests and dendroid diseases. Drought-induced mortality of trees lacks in most climate models in their representation of forests as land carbon sink.

Economic losses as a result of droughts include lower agricultural, forests, game and fishing output, higher food-production costs, lower energy-production levels in hydro plants, losses caused by depleted water tourism and transport revenue, problems with water supply for the energy sector and for technological processes in metallurgy, mining, the chemical, paper, wood, foodstuff industries etc., disruption of water supplies for municipal economies.

Further examples of common environmental and economic consequences of drought include:
* Alteration of diversity of plant communities, which can have an impact on net primary production and other ecosystem services.
* Wildfires, such as Australian bushfires and wildfires in the United States, become more common during times of drought and may cause human deaths.
* Dust Bowls, themselves a sign of erosion, which further erode the landscape
* Dust storms, when drought hits an area suffering from desertification and erosion
* Habitat damage, affecting both terrestrial and aquatic wildlife
* Snake migration, which results in snake-bites
* Reduced electricity production due to reduced water-flow through hydroelectric dams
* Shortages of water for industrial users

=== Agricultural impacts ===
Droughts can cause land degradation and loss of soil moisture, resulting in the destruction of cropland productivity. This can result in diminished crop growth or yield productions and carrying capacity for livestock. Drought in combination with high levels of grazing pressure can function as the tipping point for an ecosystem, causing woody encroachment.

Water stress affects plant development and quality in a variety of ways: firstly drought can cause poor germination and impaired seedling development. At the same time plant growth relies on cellular division, cell enlargement, and differentiation. Drought stress impairs mitosis and cell elongation via loss of turgor pressure which results in poor growth. Development of leaves is also dependent upon turgor pressure, concentration of nutrients, and carbon assimilates all of which are reduced by drought conditions, thus drought stress lead to a decrease in leaf size and number. Plant height, biomass, leaf size and stem girth has been shown to decrease in maize under water limiting conditions. Crop yield is also negatively effected by drought stress, the reduction in crop yield results from a decrease in photosynthetic rate, changes in leaf development, and altered allocation of resources all due to drought stress. Crop plants exposed to drought stress suffer from reductions in leaf water potential and transpiration rate. Water-use efficiency increases in crops such as wheat while decreasing in others, such as potatoes.

Plants need water for the uptake of nutrients from the soil, and for the transport of nutrients throughout the plant: drought conditions limit these functions leading to stunted growth. Drought stress also causes a decrease in photosynthetic activity in plants due to the reduction of photosynthetic tissues, stomatal closure, and reduced performance of photosynthetic machinery. This reduction in photosynthetic activity contributes to the reduction in plant growth and yields. Another factor influencing reduced plant growth and yields include the allocation of resources; following drought stress plants will allocate more resources to roots to aid in water uptake increasing root growth and reducing the growth of other plant parts while decreasing yields.

=== Social and health impacts ===
The most negative impacts of drought for humans include crop failure, food crisis, famine, malnutrition, and poverty, which lead to loss of life and mass migration of people.

There are negative effects on the health of people who are directly exposed to this phenomenon (excessive heat waves). Droughts can also cause limitations of water supplies, increased water pollution levels, high food-costs, stress caused by failed harvests, water scarcity, etc. Reduced water quality can occur because lower water-flows reduce dilution of pollutants and increase contamination of remaining water sources.

This explains why droughts and water scarcity operate as a factor which increases the gap between developed and developing countries.

Effects vary according to vulnerability. For example, subsistence farmers are more likely to migrate during drought because they do not have alternative food-sources. Areas with populations that depend on water sources as a major food-source are more vulnerable to famine.

Further examples of social and health consequences include:
* Water scarcity, crop failure, famine and hunger – drought provides too little water to support food crops; malnutrition, dehydration and related diseases
* Mass migration, resulting in internal displacement and international refugees
* Social unrest
* War over natural resources, including water and food
* Cyanotoxin accumulation within food chains and water supply (some of which are among the most potent toxins known to science) can cause cancer with low exposure over the long term. High levels of microcystin appeared in San Francisco Bay Area salt-water shellfish and fresh-water supplies throughout the state of California in 2016.

=== Loss of fertile soils ===

Wind erosion is much more severe in arid areas and during times of drought. For example, in the Great Plains, it is estimated that soil loss due to wind erosion can be as much as 6100 times greater in drought years than in wet years.

Loess is a homogeneous, typically nonstratified, porous, friable, slightly coherent, often calcareous, fine-grained, silty, pale yellow or buff, windblown (Aeolian) sediment. It generally occurs as a widespread blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick. Loess often stands in either steep or vertical faces. Loess tends to develop into highly rich soils. Under appropriate climatic conditions, areas with loess are among the most agriculturally productive in the world. Loess deposits are geologically unstable by nature, and will erode very readily. Therefore, windbreaks (such as big trees and bushes) are often planted by farmers to reduce the wind erosion of loess.

== Regions particularly affected ==
=== Amazon basin ===

In 2005, parts of the Amazon basin experienced the worst drought in 100 years. A 2006 article reported results showing that the forest in its present form could survive only three years of drought. Scientists at the Brazilian National Institute of Amazonian Research argue in the article that this drought response, coupled with the effects of deforestation on regional climate, are pushing the rainforest towards a &quot;tipping point&quot; where it would irreversibly start to die. It concludes that the rainforest is on the brink of being turned into savanna or desert, with catastrophic consequences for the world&#x27;s climate. According to the WWF, the combination of climate change and deforestation increases the drying effect of dead trees that fuels forest fires.

=== Australia ===

The 1997–2009 Millennium Drought in Australia led to a water supply crisis across much of the country. As a result, many desalination plants were built for the first time (see list).

By far the largest part of Australia is desert or semi-arid lands commonly known as the outback. A 2005 study by Australian and American researchers investigated the desertification of the interior, and suggested that one explanation was related to human settlers who arrived about 50,000 years ago. Regular burning by these settlers could have prevented monsoons from reaching interior Australia. In June 2008 it became known that an expert panel had warned of long term, maybe irreversible, severe ecological damage for the whole Murray-Darling basin if it did not receive sufficient water by October 2008. Australia could experience more severe droughts and they could become more frequent in the future, a government-commissioned report said on July 6, 2008. Australian environmentalist Tim Flannery, predicted that unless it made drastic changes, Perth in Western Australia could become the world&#x27;s first ghost metropolis, an abandoned city with no more water to sustain its population. The long Australian Millennial drought broke in 2010.

=== East Africa ===
East Africa, including for example Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda, has a diverse climate, ranging from hot, dry regions to cooler, wetter highland regions. The region has considerable variability in seasonal rainfall and a very complex topography. In the northern parts of the region within the Nile basin (Ethiopia, Sudan), the rainfall is characterized by an unimodal cycle with a wet season from July to September. The rest of the region has a bimodal annual cycle, featuring long rains from March to May and the short rains from October to December. The frequent occurrence of hydrological extremes, like droughts and floods, harms the already vulnerable population suffering from severe poverty and economic turmoil. Droughts prompted food shortages for example in 1984–85, 2006 and 2011.

The Eastern African region experiences the impacts of climate change in different forms. For instance, below-average rainfall occurred for six consecutive rainy seasons in the Horn of Africa during the period 2020–2023 leading to the third longest and most widespread drought on record with dire implications for food security (see Horn of Africa drought (2020–present)). Conversely, other parts experienced extreme floods, e.g., the 2020 East Africa floods in Ethiopia, Rwanda, Kenya, Burundi, and Uganda, and the 2022 floods in South Sudan.

A key feature in the region is the heterogeneous distribution of hydrologic extremes in space and time. For instance, El Niño can cause droughts in one part of the region and floods in the other. This is also a common situation within a country, e.g., in Ethiopia. The recent years with consecutive droughts followed by floods are a testament to the need to better forecast these kinds of events and their impacts.

=== Himalayan river basins ===
Approximately 2.4 billion people live in the drainage basin of the Himalayan rivers. India, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar could experience floods followed by droughts in coming decades. More than 150 districts in India are drought vulnerable, mostly concentrated in the state of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and its adjoining Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, northern Karnataka and adjoining Maharashtra of the country. Drought in India affecting the Ganges is of particular concern, as it provides drinking water and agricultural irrigation for more than 500 million people.

=== North America ===
The west coast of North America, which gets much of its water from glaciers in mountain ranges such as the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada, also would be affected.

== Protection, mitigation and relief ==

Agriculturally, people can effectively mitigate much of the impact of drought through irrigation and crop rotation. Failure to develop adequate drought mitigation strategies carries a grave human cost in the modern era, exacerbated by ever-increasing population densities.

Strategies for drought protection or mitigation include:
* Dams – many dams and their associated reservoirs supply additional water in times of drought.
* Cloud seeding – a form of intentional weather modification to induce rainfall. This remains a hotly debated topic, as the United States National Research Council released a report in 2004 stating that to date, there is still no convincing scientific proof of the efficacy of intentional weather modification.
* Land use – Carefully planned crop rotation can help to minimize erosion and allow farmers to plant less water-dependent crops in drier years.
* Transvasement – Building canals or redirecting rivers as massive attempts at irrigation in drought-prone areas.
When water is scarce due to droughts, there are a range of options for people to access other sources of water, such as wastewater reuse, rainwater harvesting and stormwater recovery, or seawater desalination.

== History ==

Throughout history, humans have usually viewed droughts as disasters due to the impact on food availability and the rest of society. Drought is among the earliest documented climatic events, present in the Epic of Gilgamesh and tied to the Biblical story of Joseph&#x27;s arrival in and the later Exodus from ancient Egypt. Hunter-gatherer migrations in 9,500 BC Chile have been linked to the phenomenon, as has the exodus of early humans out of Africa and into the rest of the world around 135,000 years ago.

Droughts can be scientifically explained in terms of physical mechanisms, which underlie natural disasters and are influenced by human impact on the environment.
Beliefs about drought are further shaped by cultural factors including local knowledge, perceptions, values, beliefs and religion. In some places and times, droughts have been interpreted as the work of supernatural forces. Globally, people in many societies have been more likely to explain natural events like drought, famine and disease in terms of the supernatural than they are to explain social phenomena like war, murder, and theft.

Historically, rituals have been used in an attempt to prevent or avert drought. Rainmaking rituals have ranged from dances to scapegoating to human sacrifices. Many ancient practices are now a matter of folklore while others may still be practiced.

In areas where people have limited understanding of the scientific basis of drought, beliefs about drought continue to reflect indigenous beliefs in the power of spirits and Christian philosophies that see drought as a divine punishment. Such beliefs can influence people&#x27;s thinking and affect their resilience and ability to adapt to stress and respond to crises. In the case of Creationism, curricula sometimes give religious explanations of natural phenomena rather than scientific ones. Teaching explicitly denies evolution, that human agency is affecting climate, and that climate change is occurring.

Some historical droughts include:
* The 4.2-kiloyear event, a megadrought that took place in Africa and Asia between 5,000 and 4,000 years ago, has been linked with the collapse of the Old Kingdom in Egypt, the Akkadian Empire in Mesopotamia, the Liangzhu culture in the lower Yangtze River area, and the Indus Valley Civilization.
* The longest drought in recorded history started 400 years ago in the Atacama Desert in Chile and still continues.
* Drought might have been a contributing factor to Classic Maya collapse between the 7th and 9th centuries.
* 1540 Central Europe, said to be the &quot;worst drought of the millennium&quot; with eleven months without rain and temperatures of 5–7 °C above the average of the 20th century
* 1900 India killing between 250,000 and 3.25 million.
* 1921–22 Soviet Union in which over 5 million perished from starvation due to the combined effects of severe drought and war.
* 1928–1930 Northwest China resulting in over 3 million deaths by famine.

<doc id="37336" wikidata="Q1985786" url="?curid=37336" title="Proleptic Julian calendar">
<text>The proleptic Julian calendar is produced by extending the Julian calendar backwards to dates preceding AD 8 when the quadrennial leap year stabilized. The leap years that were actually observed between the implementation of the Julian calendar in 45 BC and AD 8 were erratic (see the Julian calendar article for details).

A calendar obtained by extension earlier in time than its invention or implementation is called the &quot;&quot; version of the calendar. Likewise, the proleptic Gregorian calendar is occasionally used to specify dates before the introduction of the Gregorian calendar in 1582. Because the Julian calendar was used before that time, one must explicitly state that a given quoted date is based on the proleptic Gregorian calendar if that is the case.

The Julian calendar itself was introduced by Julius Caesar, and as such is older than the introduction of the Anno Domini era (or the &quot;Common Era&quot;), counting years since the birth of Christ as calculated by Dionysus Exiguus in the 6th century, and widely used in medieval European annals since about the 8th century, notably by Bede. The proleptic Julian calendar uses Anno Domini throughout, including for dates of Late Antiquity when the Julian calendar was in use but Anno Domini was not, and for times predating the introduction of the Julian calendar.
Years are given cardinal numbers, using inclusive counting (AD 1 is the first year of the Anno Domini era, immediately preceded by 1 BC, the first year preceding the Anno Domini era; there is no &quot;zeroth&quot; year).
Thus, the year 1 BC of the proleptic Julian calendar is a leap year.

This is to be distinguished from the astronomical year numbering, introduced in 1740 by French astronomer Jacques Cassini, which considers each New Year an integer on a time axis, with year 0 corresponding to 1 BC, and &quot;year −1&quot; corresponding to 2 BC, so that in this system, Julian leap years have a number divisible by four.

The determination of leap years in the proleptic Julian calendar (in either numbering) is distinct from the question of which years were historically considered leap years during the Roman era, due to the leap year error: Between 45 BC and AD 8, the leap day was somewhat unsystematic. Thus there is no simple way to find an equivalent in the proleptic Julian calendar of a date quoted using either the Roman pre-Julian calendar or the Julian calendar before AD 8. The year 46 BC itself is a special case: because of the historical introduction of the Julian calendar in that year, it was allotted 445 days. Before then, the Roman Republican calendar used a system of intercalary months rather than leap days.

<text>A soldier is a person who is a member of an army. A soldier can be a conscripted or volunteer enlisted person, a non-commissioned officer, a warrant officer, or an officer.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;soldier&quot; derives from the Middle English word , from Old French or , meaning mercenary, from , meaning shilling&#x27;s worth or wage, from or , shilling. The word is also related to the Medieval Latin , meaning soldier (). These words ultimately derive from the Late Latin word , referring to an ancient Roman coin used in the Byzantine Empire.

==Occupational and other designations==
In most armies, the word &quot;soldier&quot; has a general meaning that refers to all members of an army, distinct from more specialized military occupations that require different areas of knowledge and skill sets. &quot;Soldiers&quot; may be referred to by titles, names, nicknames, or acronyms that reflect an individual&#x27;s military occupation specialty arm, service, or branch of military employment, their type of unit, or operational employment or technical use such as: trooper, tanker (a member of tank crew), commando, dragoon, infantryman, guardsman, artilleryman, paratrooper, grenadier, ranger, sniper, engineer, sapper, craftsman, signaller, medic, rifleman, or gunner, among other terms. Some of these designations or their etymological origins have existed in the English language for centuries, while others are relatively recent, reflecting changes in technology, increased division of labor, or other factors. In the United States Army, a soldier&#x27;s military job is designated as a Military Occupational Specialty (MOS), which includes a very wide array of MOS Branches and sub-specialties. One example of a nickname for a soldier in a specific occupation is the term &quot;red caps&quot; to refer to military policemen personnel in the British Army because of the colour of their headgear.

Infantry are sometimes called &quot;grunts&quot; in the United States Army (as the well as in the U.S. Marine Corps) or &quot;squaddies&quot; (in the British Army). U.S. Army artillery crews, or &quot;gunners,&quot; are sometimes referred to as &quot;redlegs&quot;, from the service branch colour for artillery. U.S. soldiers are often called &quot;G.I.s&quot; (short for the term &quot;Government Issue&quot;). Such terms may be associated with particular wars or historical eras. &quot;G.I.&quot; came into common use during World War II and after, but prior to and during World War I especially, American soldiers were called &quot;Doughboys,&quot; while British infantry troops were often referred to as &quot;Tommies&quot; (short for the archetypal soldier &quot;Tommy Atkins&quot;) and French infantry were called &quot;Poilus&quot; (&quot;hairy ones&quot;).
Some formal or informal designations may reflect the status or changes in status of soldiers for reasons of gender, race, or other social factors. With certain exceptions, service as a soldier, especially in the infantry, had generally been restricted to males throughout world history. By World War II, women were actively deployed in Allied forces in different ways. Some notable female soldiers in the Soviet Union were honored as &quot;Heroes of the Soviet Union&quot; for their actions in the army or as partisan fighters. In the United Kingdom, women served in the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) and later in the Women&#x27;s Royal Army Corps (WRAC). Soon after its entry into the war, the U.S. formed the Women&#x27;s Army Corps, whose female soldiers were often referred to as &quot;WACs.&quot; These sex-segregated branches were disbanded in the last decades of the twentieth century and women soldiers were integrated into the standing branches of the military, although their ability to serve in armed combat was often restricted. 

Race has historically been an issue restricting the ability of some people to serve in the U.S. Army. Until the American Civil War, Black soldiers fought in integrated and sometimes separate units, but at other times were not allowed to serve, largely due to fears about the possible effects of such service on the institution of legal slavery. Some Black soldiers, both freemen and men who had escaped from slavery, served in Union forces, until 1863, when the Emancipation Proclamation opened the door for the formation of Black units. After the war, Black soldiers continued to serve, but in segregated units, often subjected to physical and verbal racist abuse. The term &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot; was applied to some units fighting in the 19th century Indian Wars in the American West. Eventually, the phrase was applied more generally to segregated Black units, who often distinguished themselves in armed conflict and other service. In 1948, President Harry S. Truman issued an executive order for the end of segregation in the United States Armed Forces.

==Service==
===Conscription===
Throughout history, individuals have often been compelled by force or law to serve in armies and other armed forces in times of war or other times. Modern forms of such compulsion are generally referred to as &quot;conscription&quot; or a &quot;draft&quot;. Currently, many countries require registration for some form of mandatory service, although that requirement may be selectively enforced or exist only in law and not in practice. Usually the requirement applies to younger male citizens, though it may extend to women and non-citizen residents as well. In times of war, the requirements, such as age, may be broadened when additional troops are thought to be needed. 

At different times and places, some individuals have been able to avoid conscription by having another person take their place. Modern draft laws may provide temporary or permanent exemptions from service or allow some other non-combatant service, as in the case of conscientious objectors.

In the United States, males aged 18-25 are required to register with the Selective Service System, which has responsibility for overseeing the draft. However, no draft has occurred since 1973, and the U.S. military has been able to maintain staffing through voluntary enlistment. 

===Enlistment===
Soldiers in war may have various motivations for voluntarily enlisting and remaining in an army or other armed forces branch. In a study of 18th century soldiers&#x27; written records about their time in service, historian Ilya Berkovich suggests &quot;three primary &#x27;levers&#x27; of motivation ... &#x27;coercive&#x27;, &#x27;remunerative&#x27;, and &#x27;normative&#x27; incentives.&quot; Berkovich argues that historians&#x27; assumptions that fear of coercive force kept unwilling conscripts in check and controlled rates of desertion have been overstated and that any pay or other remuneration for service as provided then would have been an insufficient incentive. Instead, &quot;old-regime common soldiers should be viewed primarily as willing participants who saw themselves as engaged in a distinct and honourable activity.&quot; In modern times, soldiers have volunteered for armed service, especially in time of war, out of a sense of patriotic duty to their homeland or to advance a social, political, or ideological cause, while improved levels of remuneration or training might be more of an incentive in times of economic hardship. Soldiers might also enlist for personal reasons, such as following family or social expectations, or for the order and discipline provided by military training, as well as for the friendship and connection with their fellow soldiers afforded by close contact in a common enterprise.

In 2018, the RAND Corporation published the results of a study of contemporary American soldiers in &quot;Life as a Private: A Study of the Motivations and Experiences of Junior Enlisted Personnel in the U.S. Army&quot;. The study found that &quot;soldiers join the Army for family, institutional, and occupational reasons, and many value the opportunity to become a military professional. They value their relationships with other soldiers, enjoy their social lives, and are satisfied with Army life.&quot; However, the authors cautioned that the survey sample consisted of only 81 soldiers and that &quot;the findings of this study cannot be generalized to the U.S. Army as a whole or to any rank.&quot;

===Length of service===
The length of time that an individual is required to serve as a soldier has varied with country and historical period, whether that individual has been drafted or has voluntarily enlisted. Such service, depending on the army&#x27;s need for staffing or the individual&#x27;s fitness and eligibility, may involve fulfillment of a contractual obligation. That obligation might extend for the duration of an armed conflict or may be limited to a set number of years in active duty and/or inactive duty. 

As of 2023, service in the U.S. Army is for a Military Service Obligation of 2 to 6 years of active duty with a remaining term in the Individual Ready Reserve. Individuals may also enlist for part-time duty in the Army Reserve or National Guard. Depending on need or fitness to serve, soldiers usually may reenlist for another term, possibly receiving monetary or other incentives.

In the U.S. Army, career soldiers who have served for at least 20 years are eligible to draw on a retirement pension. The size of the pension as a percentage of the soldier&#x27;s salary usually increases with the length of time served on active duty.

==In media and popular culture==

Since the earliest recorded history, soldiers and warfare have been depicted in countless works, including songs, folk tales, stories, memoirs, biographies, novels and other narrative fiction, drama, films, and more recently television and video, comic books, graphic novels, and games. Often these portrayals have emphasized the heroic qualities of soldiers in war, but at times have emphasized war&#x27;s inherent dangers, confusions, and trauma and their effect on individual soldiers and others.

<text>Paul Lansky (born June 18, 1944, in New York City) is an American composer.

==Biography==
Paul Lansky (born 1944) is an American composer. He was educated at Manhattan&#x27;s High School of Music and Art, Queens College and Princeton University, studying with George Perle and Milton Babbitt, among others. He received his Ph.D. in music from Princeton in 1973. His doctoral dissertation consisted of an essay titled &quot;Affine music&quot; and a composition of string quartet. Originally intending to pursue a career in performance, during 1965–66 he played the French horn with the Dorian Wind Quintet. He left the group to attend graduate school. From 1969 until his retirement in 2014 he was on the faculty at Princeton University where he retired as the William Shubael Conant Professor of Music. He chaired the Department from 1991–2000. In 2000 he received a lifetime achievement award from the Society for Electro-Acoustic Music in the United States. In 2009–10 he was the inaugural composer in residence with the Alabama Symphony. In 2016 he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He has received grants and awards from the Guggenheim Foundation, the Fromm Foundation and the Koussevitsky Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts and Chamber Music America, among others.

==Computer music==
Beginning in the mid 1960s Lansky was among the first to experiment with the computer for sound synthesis. Until 2004 this was his predominant focus. Since then he has alternated between instrumental composition and electronic music.

Sounds originating from &quot;real-world&quot; sources are the predominant focus of Lansky&#x27;s computer music: traffic, kids in the kitchen, musical instruments, and most of all speech. Electronic synthesis is frequently used but the main sonic resources are transformations of recorded natural sounds. One of his first large pieces, &quot;Six Fantasies on a Poem by Thomas Campion&quot; (1979) set the stage. It is based on a reading by his wife Hannah MacKay of a famous poem. The piece is not so much a setting of the poem as it is a study of the contours of a live reading of the poem. The work uses a technique known as linear predictive coding, LPC, which was developed in the 1960s by scientists as a data-reduction technique meant to economize on the amount of data needed for digital voice transmission and is used today in some cell phone communication. It allows for the separation of pitch and speed and the pitch contours of the speech can be altered independently of the speed. Each of the six movements explores a different aspect of speech. This led to a series of &quot;chatter&quot; pieces, &quot;Idle Chatter&quot;, etc. that fragment the speech into a percussive rap-like texture. Other projects included folksong settings (&quot;Folk Images&quot;), a portrait of a woman (&quot;Things She Carried&quot;), a contemplation of letters and numbers (&quot;Alphabet Book&quot;), sounds of the highway (&quot;Night Traffic&quot;, &quot;Ride&quot;), blues harmonica, electric guitar, piano improvisation and casual conversation. The bulk of his approximately 70 electronic compositions are contained on ten solo CDs (see Discography). While there are a few pieces for electronics and live instruments the bulk of Lansky&#x27;s pieces are recorded &quot;tape&quot; pieces.

Lansky&#x27;s works have attracted interest in various realms. They have been used by dance companies (Bill T. Jones, Eliot Feld Ballet, New York City Ballet). His works frequently have a rhythmic &quot;groove&quot; that is attractive to dancers. In 2000 he was the co-subject (along with Francis Dhomont) of a documentary film made for the European Arte network by Uli Aumüller, &quot;My Cinema for the Ears&quot; that deals with the use of natural sounds. A four-chord sequence from Lansky&#x27;s first large computer piece &quot;Mild und leise&quot; (1972) was sampled by the English rock band Radiohead for the track &quot;Idioteque&quot; on their 2000 &quot;Kid A&quot; album.

==Software==
Lansky used any available computing hardware: IBM mainframes at first (1966–84), then mini and micro computers by DEC, (1984–89), and finally personal computers by NeXT, Silicon Graphics and Apple Computer. During the mainframe era computer time was scarce and expensive, and this prompted Lansky to write his own software package called &quot;Mix&quot;, in Fortran. This made it easier to assemble a composition voice-by-voice, section-by-section, even note-by-note, avoiding large expensive runs to create an entire piece at once. Mix had no scheduler (meaning that it could create notes in any order) and thus was not suitable for real-time synthesis. Mix used additive writes to the output device, analogous to overdubbing on tape. When the move was made to minis and micros, Lansky ported Mix to the C programming language and called it CMix. During the late 1990s a group led by Brad Garton at Columbia University created a version with a scheduler, RtCmix, that was capable of real time synthesis. Starting in the mid 1990s Lansky used a well-known software package called SuperCollider. Programs like Cmix and SuperCollider are script-based rather than driven by a graphical interface. (Input data is frequently in the form of a program rather than a note list.) This facilitated the creation of complex textures in works such as Idle Chatter, which contain thousands of short notes, frequently selected using random methods. This is sometimes called algorithmic composition.

==Instrumental music==
During the mid 1990s Lansky began to be approached by performers who were attracted to the performative-like aspects of his computer music. Percussionists in particular were attracted by pieces such as &quot;Table’s Clear&quot;, which resembles a gamelan made of pots and pans, and the &quot;chatter&quot; series. One of his first large percussion pieces was &quot;Threads&quot;, 2005, written for the Sō Percussion quartet. Since then there are about a dozen pieces for percussion instruments, alone and in various ensembles. Another focus has been classical guitar, alone and in combination: &quot;Semi-Suite&quot;, &quot;With the Grain&quot; (concerto), Partita (guitar and percussion.) A residency with the Alabama Symphony led to several orchestral pieces (&quot;Shapeshifters&quot;, &quot;Imaginary Islands&quot;). Significant commissions came from the Library of Congress and the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center for the wind quintet &quot;The Long and Short of It&quot;, and Chamber Music America for a trio for the Janus Trio, &quot;Book of Memory&quot;, and for Sō Percussion, &quot;Springs&quot;. The 2004 trio for horn, violin and piano, &quot;Etudes and Parodies&quot; won the 2005 International Horn Society prize. Lansky&#x27;s instrumental music is published by Carl Fischer. The bulk of his computer music as well as much instrumental music is available on Bridge Records.

==Harmony==
Most of Lansky&#x27;s works are basically tonal. In general terms this means the apparent background source for his pitch language is the diatonic scale rather than the chromatic or microtonal scale. He frequently uses traditional tonal syntax. During 1969–72 he collaborated with George Perle on an expansion of Perle&#x27;s 12-tone tonality, which led to Perle&#x27;s book of the same name. This approach basically establishes another metric for measuring and relating harmonies that has to do with symmetry. It is related to some music by Bartok. Some of Lansky&#x27;s work such as &quot;Notes to Self&quot;, for piano, and &quot;It All Adds Up&quot;, for two pianos, use this approach. Lansky&#x27;s instrumental music generally eschews extended instrumental techniques. He writes that he scratched that itch with computer music.

A long-term interest of Lansky&#x27;s is music &quot;about&quot; music. Earlier examples of this are his computer pieces &quot;Guy&#x27;s Harp&quot;, about blues harmonica, and &quot;Not So Heavy Metal&quot;, about rock and roll guitar. More recent examples are &quot;Book of Memory&quot;, which comments on music from Machaut to Scriabin, &quot;Ancient Echoes&quot;, based on late-16th-century dance music, and &quot;Ricercare Plus&quot;, inspired by 17th-century counterpoint.
