<text>Clovis (; reconstructed Frankish: ; – 27 November 511) was the first king of the Franks to unite all of the Franks under one ruler, changing the form of leadership from a group of petty kings to rule by a single king, and ensuring that the kingship was passed down to his heirs. He is considered to have been the founder of the Merovingian dynasty, which ruled the Frankish kingdom for the next two centuries. Clovis is important in the historiography of France as &quot;the first king of what would become France.&quot;

Clovis succeeded his father, Childeric I, as a king of the Salian Franks in 481, and eventually came to rule an area extending from what is now the southern Netherlands to northern France, corresponding in Roman terms to Gallia Belgica (northern Gaul). At the Battle of Soissons (486), he established his military dominance of the rump state of the fragmenting Western Roman Empire, which was then under the command of Syagrius. By the time of his death in 511, Clovis had conquered several smaller Frankish kingdoms in the northeast of Gaul, stretching into what is now Germany. Clovis also conquered the Alemanni in eastern Gaul and the Visigothic kingdom of Aquitania in the southwest. These campaigns added significantly to Clovis&#x27;s domains and established his dynasty as a major political and military presence in western Europe.

Clovis is also significant because of his baptism in 508, largely at the behest of his wife, Clotilde, who would later be venerated as a saint for this act, celebrated today in both the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church. The adoption by Clovis of Catholicism (as opposed to the Arianism of most other Germanic tribes) led to widespread conversion among the Franks, and eventually to religious unification across what is now modern-day France, the Low Countries and Germany. The alliance between the Franks and Catholicism eventually led to Charlemagne&#x27;s crowning by the Pope as emperor in 800, and to the subsequent birth of the early Holy Roman Empire in the middle of the 10th century.

== Name ==

Based on the attested forms, the original name is reconstructed in the Frankish language as *&quot;Hlōdowik&quot; or *&quot;Hlōdowig&quot; and is traditionally considered to be composed of two elements, deriving from both Proto-Germanic: &quot;*hlūdaz&quot; (&quot;loud, famous&quot;) and &quot;*wiganą&quot; (&quot;to battle, to fight&quot;), resulting in the traditional practice of translating Clovis&#x27; name as meaning &quot;famous warrior&quot; or &quot;renowned in battle&quot;.

However, scholars have pointed out that Gregory of Tours consistently transcribes the names of various Merovingian royal names containing the first element as &quot;chlodo-&quot;. The use of a close-mid back rounded vowel (o), rather than the expected close back rounded vowel (u) that Gregory does use in various other Germanic names (i.e. Fredegundis, Arnulfus, Gundobadus, etc.) opens up the possibility that the first element instead derives from Proto-Germanic &quot;*hlutą&quot; (&quot;lot, share, portion&quot;), giving the meaning of the name as &quot;loot bringer&quot; or &quot;plunder (bringing) warrior&quot;. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that if the first element is taken to mean &quot;famous&quot;, then the name of Chlodomer (one of Clovis&#x27; sons) would contain two elements (&quot;*hlūdaz&quot; and &quot;*mērijaz&quot;) both meaning &quot;famous&quot;, which would be highly uncommon within the typical Germanic name structure.

In Middle Dutch, a language closely related to Frankish, the name was rendered as &quot;Lodewijch&quot; (cf. modern Dutch &quot;Lodewijk&quot;). The name is found in other West Germanic languages, with cognates including Old English &quot;Hloðwig&quot;, Old Saxon &quot;Hluduco&quot;, and Old High German &quot;Hludwīg&quot; (variant &quot;Hluotwīg&quot;). The latter turned into &quot;Ludwig&quot; in Modern German, although the king Clovis himself is generally named Chlodwig. The Old Norse form &quot;Hlǫðvér&quot; was most likely borrowed from a West Germanic language.

The Frankish name &quot;*Hlodowig&quot; is at the origin of the French given name &quot;Louis&quot; (variant &quot;Ludovic&quot;), borne by 18 kings of France, via the Latinized form &quot;Hludovicus&quot; (variants &quot;Ludhovicus, Lodhuvicus&quot;, or &quot;Chlodovicus&quot;). The English &quot;Lewis&quot; stems from the Anglo-French &quot;Louis&quot;.

==Background==
Clovis was the son of Childeric I, a king of the Salian Franks, and Basina, a Thuringian princess. The dynasty he founded is, however, named after his supposed ancestor, Merovech. Some sources claim that Clovis&#x27; grandfather was Chlodio, but his exact relation with Merovech is not known.

Numerous small Frankish petty kingdoms existed during the 5th century. The Salian Franks was the first-known Frankish tribe that settled with official Roman permission within the empire, first in Batavia in the Rhine-Maas delta, and then in 375 in Toxandria, which in the present day consists of the province of North Brabant in the Netherlands and parts of neighbouring provinces of Antwerp and Limburg in Belgium. This put them in the northern part of the Roman civitas Tungrorum, with the Romanized population still dominant south of the military highway Boulogne-Cologne. Later, Chlodio seems to have attacked westwards from this area to take control of the Roman populations in Tournai, then southwards to Artois, and Cambrai, eventually controlling an area stretching to the Somme river.

Childeric I, Clovis&#x27;s father, was reputed to be a relative of Chlodio and was known as the king of the Franks who fought as an army within northern Gaul. In 463, he fought in conjunction with Aegidius, the magister militum of northern Gaul, to defeat the Visigoths in Orléans. Childeric died in 481 and was buried in Tournai; Clovis succeeded him as king, aged just 15. Historians believe that Childeric and Clovis were both commanders of the Roman military in the province of Belgica Secunda and were subordinate to the magister militum. The Franks of Tournai came to dominate their neighbours, initially aided by the association with Aegidius.

The death of Aetius in 454 led to the decline of imperial power in Gaul; leaving the Visigoths and the Burgundians competing for predominance in the area. The part of Gaul still under Roman control emerged as a kingdom under Syagrius, Aegidius&#x27;s son.

Though no primary sources expounding on the language spoken by Clovis exist, historical linguists consider it likely that, based on his family history and core territories, he spoke a form of Old Dutch. In this, the early Merovingians can be contrasted with the later Carolingians, such as Charlemagne, of the late 8th century and onward, who probably spoke various forms of Old High German.

==Early reign (481–491)==
===Road to Soissons===
The ruler of Tournai died in 481 and was succeeded by his young son, Clovis. His band of warriors probably numbered no more than half a thousand. In 486 he began his efforts to expand the realm by allying himself with his relative Ragnachar, king of Cambrai and another Frankish king, Chalaric. These rulers are sometimes referred to as &quot;regulus&quot; (diminutive of &quot;rex&quot;). Together the triumvirate marched against Syagrius and met the Gallo-Roman commander at Soissons. During the battle, Chalaric betrayed his comrades by refusing to take part in the fighting. Despite the betrayal, the Franks landed a decisive victory, forcing Syagrius to flee to the court of Alaric II. This battle is viewed as bringing about the end of the rump state of the Western Roman Empire outside of Italy. Following the battle, Clovis invaded the traitor Chalaric&#x27;s territory and was able to imprison him and his son.

===Taming Gaul===

Prior to the battle, Clovis did not enjoy the support of the Gallo-Roman clergy, so he proceeded to pillage the Roman territory, including the churches. The Bishop of Reims requested Clovis return everything taken from the Church of Reims; the young king aspired to establish cordial relationships with the clergy, so he returned a valuable ewer taken from the church. Despite his position, some Roman cities refused to yield to the Franks, namely Verdun ‒ which surrendered after a brief siege ‒ and Paris, which stubbornly resisted a few years, perhaps as many as five. He made Paris his capital and established an abbey dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul on the south bank of the Seine.

Realizing that he would not be able to rule Gaul without the help of the clergy, Clovis took a Catholic wife to please them. He also integrated many of Syagrius&#x27;s units into his own army. The Roman kingdom was probably under Clovis&#x27;s control by 491 because in the same year, Clovis successfully moved against a small number of Thuringians in eastern Gaul, near the Burgundian border.

==Middle reign (492–506)==
===Barbarian bonding===

Around 493 AD, he secured an alliance with the Ostrogoths through the marriage of his sister Audofleda to their king, Theodoric the Great.
In the same year, the neighboring King of the Burgundians was slain by his brother, Gundobad; bringing civil strife to that kingdom. Allegedly, Gundobad proceeded to drown his sister-in-law and force his niece, Chrona, into a convent. Another niece, Clotilde, fled to the court of the third brother, Godegisel. Finding himself in a precarious position, Godegisel decided to ally himself to Clovis by marrying his exiled niece to the Frankish king.

===Assault of the Alamanni===

In 496, the Alamanni invaded and some Salians and Ripuarians &quot;reguli&quot; (kings) defected to their side. Clovis met his enemies near the strong fort of Tolbiac. During the fighting, the Franks suffered heavy losses. Clovis, together with over three thousand Frankish companions, may have converted to Christianity around this time. With the help of the Ripuarian Franks he narrowly defeated the Alamanni in the Battle of Tolbiac in 496. Now Christian, Clovis confined his prisoners, Chararic and his son, to a monastery.

===Business in Burgundy===

In 500 or 501, Godegisel began scheming against his brother Gundobad. He promised his brother-in-law territory and annual tribute for defeating his brother. Clovis was eager to subdue the political threat to his realm and crossed into the Burgundian territory. Gundobad then moved against Clovis and called his brother for reinforcements. The three armies met near Dijon, where both the Franks and Godegisel&#x27;s forces defeated the dumbfounded Gundobad, who escaped to Avignon. Clovis pursued him and laid siege to the city. After some months, Clovis was convinced to abandon the siege and settled for an annual tribute from Gundobad.

===Armorici allies===
In 501, 502 or 503, Clovis led his troops to Armorica. He had previously restricted his operations to minor raids, but now the goal was subjugation. Clovis failed to complete this objective via military means; therefore, he was constrained to statecraft. This proved fruitful, for the Armonici shared Clovis&#x27;s disdain for the Arian Visigoths. Armorica and its fighters were thus integrated into the Frankish realm.

==Late reign (507–511)==

===Visiting the Visigoths===

In 507 Clovis was allowed by the magnates of his realm to invade the remaining threat of the Kingdom of the Visigoths. King Alaric had previously tried to establish a cordial relationship with Clovis by serving him the head of exiled Syagrius on a silver plate in 486 or 487. However, Clovis was no longer able to resist the temptation to move against the Visigoths, for many Catholics under Visigoth yoke were unhappy and implored Clovis to make a move. But just to be absolutely certain about retaining the loyalties of the Christians under Visigoths, Clovis ordered his troops to omit raiding and plunder, for this was not a foreign invasion, but a liberation.

Armorici assisted him in defeating the Visigothic kingdom of Toulouse in the Battle of Vouillé in 507, eliminating Visigothic power in Gaul. The battle added most of Aquitaine to Clovis&#x27;s kingdom and resulted in the death of the Visigothic king Alaric II.

According to Gregory of Tours, following the battle the Byzantine Emperor Anastasius I made Clovis a patrician and honorary consul.

===Unifying the Franks===
Following the Battle of Vouillé, Clovis eliminated all his possible rivals, including the other Frankish kings who ruled alongside him.

Sometime after 507, Clovis heard about Chararic&#x27;s plan to escape from his monastic prison and had him murdered. Around the same time, Clovis convinced Prince Chlodoric to murder his father Sigobert, earning him his nickname as &quot;Chlodoric the Parricide&quot;. Following the murder, Clovis betrayed Chlodoric and had his envoys strike him down. Sometime later, Clovis visited his old ally Ragnachar in Cambrai. Following his conversion to Christianity in 508, many of Clovis&#x27; pagan retainers had defected to Ragnachar&#x27;s side, making him a political threat. Ragnachar denied Clovis&#x27;s entry, prompting Clovis to make a move against him. He bribed Ragnachar&#x27;s retainers and executed him alongside his brother Ricchar.

===Death===
Shortly before his death, Clovis called a synod of Gallic bishops to meet in Orléans to reform the Church and create a strong link between the Crown and the Catholic episcopate. This was the First Council of Orléans. Thirty-three bishops assisted and passed 31 decrees on the duties and obligations of individuals, the right of sanctuary, and ecclesiastical discipline. These decrees, equally applicable to Franks and Romans, first established equality between conquerors and conquered. After his death, Clovis was laid to rest in the Abbey of St Genevieve in Paris.

His remains were relocated to Saint Denis Basilica in the mid- to late 18th century. When Clovis died, his kingdom was partitioned among his four sons, Theuderic, Chlodomer, Childebert and Clotaire. This partition created the new political units of the Kingdoms of Rheims, Orléans, Paris and Soissons, and inaugurated a tradition that would lead to disunity lasting until the end of the Merovingian dynasty in 751. Clovis had been a king with no fixed capital and no central administration beyond his entourage. By deciding to be interred at Paris, Clovis gave the city symbolic weight. When his grandchildren divided royal power 50 years after his death in 511, Paris was kept as a joint property and a fixed symbol of the dynasty.

The disunity continued under the Carolingians until, after a brief unity under Charlemagne, the Franks splintered into distinct spheres of cultural influence that coalesced around Eastern and Western centers of royal power. These later political, linguistic, and cultural entities became the Kingdom of France, the myriad German States, and the semi-autonomous kingdoms of Burgundy and Lotharingia.

==Baptism==
Clovis was born a pagan but later became interested in converting to Arian Christianity, whose followers believed that Jesus was a distinct and separate being from God the Father, both subordinate to and created by him. This contrasted with Nicene Christianity, whose followers believe that God the Father, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are three persons of one being (consubstantiality). While the theology of the Arians was declared a heresy at the First Council of Nicea in 325, the missionary work of Bishop Ulfilas converted a significant portion of the pagan Goths to Arian Christianity in the 4th century. By the time of the ascension of Clovis, Gothic Arians dominated Christian Gaul, and Nicene Christians were the minority.

Clovis&#x27;s wife Clotilde, a Burgundian princess, was a Nicene Christian despite the Arianism that surrounded her at court. Her persistence eventually persuaded Clovis to convert to Nicene Christianity, which he initially resisted. Clotilde had wanted her son to be baptized, but Clovis refused, so she had the child baptized without Clovis&#x27;s knowledge. Shortly after his baptism, their son died, which further strengthened Clovis&#x27;s resistance to conversion. Clotilde also had their second son baptized without her husband&#x27;s permission, and this son became ill and nearly died after his baptism. Clovis eventually converted to Nicene Christianity (Catholicism) on Christmas Day 508 in a small church in the vicinity of the subsequent Abbey of Saint-Remi in Reims; a statue of his baptism by Saint Remigius can still be seen there. The details of this event have been passed down by Gregory of Tours, who recorded them many years later in the 6th century.

The king&#x27;s Nicene baptism was of immense importance in the subsequent history of Western and Central Europe in general, as Clovis expanded his dominion over almost all of Gaul. Catholicism offered certain advantages to Clovis as he fought to distinguish his rule among many competing power centers in Western Europe. His conversion to the Nicene form of Christianity served to set him apart from most other Germanic kings of his time, such as those of the Visigoths and the Vandals, who had converted from Germanic paganism to Arian Christianity. However, he was not the first Germanic king to convert to Nicene Christianity, that distinction belonging to the Suevic king of Gallaecia Rechiar, whose conversion predates Clovis&#x27;s baptism by half a century. Nevertheless, Clovis&#x27;s embrace of the Catholic faith may have also gained him the support of the Catholic Gallo-Roman aristocracy in his later campaign against the Visigoths, which drove them from southern Gaul in 507 and resulted in a great many of his people converting to Catholicism as well.

On the other hand, Bernard Bachrach has argued that his conversion from Frankish paganism alienated many of the other Frankish sub-kings and weakened his military position over the next few years. In the , Saint Gregory of Tours gave the Germanic gods that Clovis abandoned the names of roughly equivalent Roman gods, such as Jupiter and Mercury. William Daly, more directly assessing Clovis&#x27;s allegedly barbaric and pagan origins, ignored the Gregory of Tours version and based his account on the scant earlier sources, a sixth-century of Saint Genevieve and letters to or concerning Clovis from bishops (now in the ) and Theodoric.

Clovis and his wife were buried in the Abbey of St Genevieve (St. Pierre) in Paris; the original name of the church was the Church of the Holy Apostles.

== Roman law ==

Under Clovis, the first codification of the Salian Frank law took place. The &quot;Roman Law&quot; was written with the assistance of Gallo-Romans to reflect the Salic legal tradition and Christianity, while containing much from Roman tradition. The &quot;Roman Law&quot; lists various crimes as well as the fines associated with them.

==Legacy==
The legacy of Clovis&#x27;s conquests, a Frankish kingdom that included most of Roman Gaul and parts of western Germany, survived long after his death. To many French people, he is the founder of the modern French state.

Detracting, perhaps, from this legacy, is his aforementioned division of the state. This was done not along national or even largely geographical lines, but primarily to assure equal income amongst his sons after his death. While it may or may not have been his intention, this division was the cause of much internal discord in Gaul. This precedent led, in the long run, to the fall of his dynasty, for it was a pattern repeated in future reigns. Clovis did bequeath to his heirs the support of both people and the Church such that when the magnates were ready to do away with the royal house, the sanction of the Pope was sought first.

=== Sainthood ===

In later centuries, Clovis was venerated as a saint in France. The Benedictine Abbey of Saint-Denis (where Clovis was buried) had a shrine to St. Clovis to the east of the main altar. There was also a shrine to him in the Abbey of Saint Genevieve in Paris. This shrine had a statue and a number of epitaphs and was probably where the veneration of St. Clovis began. Despite Clovis&#x27;s presence in Paris, his cultus was largely based in the south of France. Abbot Aymeric de Peyrat (d. 1406), the author of the History of the Moissac Abbey, claimed that his own monastery was founded by St. Clovis and there were many monasteries named in his honour. Aymeric not only referred to Clovis as a saint but also prayed for St. Clovis&#x27;s intercession. There were also known to be shrines dedicated to Clovis in Église Sainte-Marthe de Tarascon and Saint-Pierre-du-Dorât. Boniface Symoneta, Jacques Almain and Paulus Aemilius Veronensis gave hagiographic accounts of Clovis&#x27;s life and at the time it was common to include Clovis&#x27;s life in collections of the lives of the saints.

It has been suggested that the reason that the French state promoted the veneration of Clovis in the south was to establish a border cult that would cause Occitans to venerate the northern-led French state by venerating its founder. Another reason could be that Clovis was a preferable foundation figure for the House of Valois as their predecessors were the Direct Capetians who looked back to Charlemagne whose veneration had been widely recognised. In contrast to the theory of St. Clovis&#x27;s cult being a primarily northern-supported movement, Amy Goodrich Remensnyder suggests that St. Clovis was used by Occitans to reject the northern concept of the monarchy and to reinstate their autonomy as something granted by the saint.

St. Clovis had the role of a more militarised royal saint than the pious Louis IX of France. As a saint, Clovis was important as he represented the spiritual birth of the nation and provided a chivalrous and ascetic model for French political leaders to follow. The veneration of St. Clovis was not exclusive to France as a print by the Holy Roman woodcut designer Leonhard Beck made for the Habsburg monarchs depicts Clovis as St. Chlodoveus, St. Boniface&#x27;s Abbey in Munich depicted St. Chlodoveus as a saint worthy of emulation because of his advocacy, and the Florentine Baroque painter Carlo Dolci painted a large depiction of St. Clovis for the Imperial Apartment in the Uffizi Gallery.

St. Clovis had no known official canonisation, neither was he beatified, so his sainthood was only ever recognised by popular acclaim. Following the example of the monks of St. Geneviève, St. Clovis&#x27;s feast day in France was held on 27 November. St. Clovis enjoyed a persistent campaign from French royal authorities that few non-French national or dynastic saints did. French monarchs, beginning in the 14th century at the latest, attempted to officially canonise Clovis a number of times. The most notable attempt, led by King Louis XI and modelled on the successful canonisation campaign of Louis IX, occurred during a conflict with the Burgundians. The cause for Clovis&#x27;s canonisation was taken up once again in the 17th century, with Jesuit support, a &quot;vita&quot; and an account of posthumous miracles, in opposition to the controversial historical works of Calvinist pastor Jean de Serres who portrayed Clovis as a cruel and bloodthirsty king.

The Jesuit attempt to formally canonize Clovis came after a rediscovery of Clovis&#x27;s &quot;cultus&quot; in the 16th century. During this period, the dual role St. Clovis could have for modern France was clarified as that of a deeply sinful man who attained sainthood by submitting himself to the will of God, as well as being the founder of the Gallican Church. He also attained an essentially mystic reputation. St. Clovis&#x27; role in calling for the First Council of Orléans was understood to be strongly Gallican as he called it without Papal authority and with the understanding that he and his bishops had the authority to call councils that were binding for the Frankish people. For Protestant Gallicans, St. Clovis represented the role of the monarchy in governing the Church and curbing its abuses and was contrasted positively against the Papacy of his time. Protestants were unlikely to mention any of the miracles attributed to St. Clovis, sometimes even writing lengthy rejections of their existence. Instead, they saw his sainthood as evident from his creation of a state more holy and Christian than that of Rome.

Catholic writers in the 16th century expanded upon the lists of St. Clovis&#x27;s attributed miracles, but in the early 17th century they also began to minimize their use of the miraculous elements of his hagiography. Mid-to-late-17th-century Jesuit writers resisted this trend and allowed for no doubt as to the miraculous nature of St. Clovis life or his sainthood. Jesuit writers stressed the more extreme elements of his hagiography, and that of other saints associated with him, even claiming that St. Remigius lived for five hundred years. These hagiographies would still be quoted and widely believed as late as 1896, the fourteenth centenary of his baptism, as a speech from Cardinal Langénieux demonstrates. Another factor that led to a resurgence in St. Clovis&#x27;s veneration was the Spanish Monarchy&#x27;s use of the title Catholic Monarchs, a title French Monarchs hoped to usurp by attributing it to the much earlier figure of St. Clovis.

==Chronology==
The sole source for the early Frankish period is Gregory of Tours, who wrote around the year 590. His chronology for the reign of Clovis is almost certainly fabricated, often contradicting itself and other sources. Gregory often divides Clovis&#x27; life in spans of 5 years: he became king at age 15, defeated Syagrius in the 5th year of his reign, defeated the Alamanni in his 15th year, defeated the Visigoths in his 25th year, and died at the age of 45, in the 5th year after his victory at Vouillé, having reigned 30 years. The exact date on which Clovis became &quot;king of all Franks&quot; is not known, but it happened sometime after the Battle of Vouillé, which is securely dated to 507. After this battle, Clovis made Paris his capital, converted to Catholicism, and orchestrated the murders of Frankish kings Sigobert and Ragnachar, uniting all Franks under his rule. Clovis&#x27; baptism, traditionally dated to December 496 on the account of Gregory, is now believed to have taken place in December 508. The election of Paris as capital must have also happened around 508. Given that the hostilities between Ragnachar and Clovis began after his conversion, it can be inferred that their confrontation took place shortly after, in 509.

Clovis I is traditionally said to have died on 27 November 511. The day is found in one medieval calendar and two missals now in the Library of the Abbey of Saint Genevieve (which was founded by Clovis). However, two obituaries in the abbeys of Saint Genevieve and Saint Denis date his death to 29 November and 3 January, respectively. The latter date may be a confusion with the feast of Genevieve, which also falls on 3 January. Gregory of Tours states that Clovis died on the fifth year after the Battle of Vouillé, which gives 511 using inclusive counting. However, he also states that he died on the 11th year of the episcopate of Licinius of Tours (AD 518) and on the 112th year after the death of Martin of Tours (AD 508). The &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; records that Clovis&#x27; crown was sent to Pope Hormisdas (514–523), which could imply a later date. Clovis is last attested in an official document dated to 11 July 511, on the First Council of Orléans, and it is generally accepted that he died shortly after.

<text>Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. Fish are often caught as wildlife from the natural environment (freshwater or marine), but may also be caught from stocked bodies of water such as ponds, canals, park wetlands and reservoirs. Fishing techniques include trawling, longlining, jigging, hand-gathering, spearing, netting, angling, shooting and trapping, as well as more destructive and often illegal techniques such as electrocution, blasting and poisoning.

The term fishing broadly includes catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as crustaceans (shrimp/lobsters/crabs), shellfish, cephalopods (octopus/squid) and echinoderms (starfish/sea urchins). The term is not normally applied to harvesting fish raised in controlled cultivations (fish farming). Nor is it normally applied to hunting aquatic mammals, where terms like whaling and sealing are used instead.

Fishing has been an important part of human culture since hunter-gatherer times. It is one of the few food production activities that has persisted from prehistory into the modern age, surviving both the Neolithic Revolution and successive Industrial Revolutions. In addition to fishing for food, people commonly fish as a recreational pastime. Fishing tournaments are held, and caught fish are sometimes kept long-term as preserved or living trophies. When BioBlitzes occur, fish are typically caught, identified, and then released.

According to the United Nations FAO statistics, the total number of commercial fishers and fish farmers is estimated to be 39.0 million. Fishing industries and aquaculture provide direct and indirect employment to over 500 million people in developing countries. In 2005, the worldwide &quot;per capita&quot; consumption of fish captured from wild fisheries was , with an additional harvested from fish farms.

==History==
Fishing is an ancient practice that dates back to at least the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic period about 40,000 years ago. Isotopic analysis of the remains of Tianyuan man, a 40,000-year-old modern human from eastern Asia, has shown that he regularly consumed freshwater fish. Archaeology features such as shell middens, discarded fish bones, and cave paintings show that seafood was important for survival and consumed in significant quantities. Fishing in Africa is evident very early on in human history. Neanderthals were fishing by about 200,000 BC. People could have developed basketry for fish traps, using spinning and early forms of knitting to make fishing nets able to catch more fish.

During this period, most people lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and were, of necessity, constantly on the move. However, where there are early examples of permanent settlements (though not necessarily permanently occupied) such as those at Lepenski Vir, they are almost always associated with fishing as a major source of food.

===Trawling===
The British dogger was a very early type of sailing trawler from the 17th century, but the modern fishing trawler was developed in the 19th century, at the English fishing port of Brixham. By the early 19th century, the fishers at Brixham needed to expand their fishing area further than ever before due to the ongoing depletion of stocks that was occurring in the overfished waters of South Devon. The Brixham trawler that evolved there was of a sleek build and had a tall gaff rig, which gave the vessel sufficient speed to make long-distance trips out to the fishing grounds in the ocean. They were also sufficiently robust to be able to tow large trawls in deep water. The great trawling fleet that built up at Brixham earned the village the title of &#x27;Mother of Deep-Sea Fisheries&#x27;.
This revolutionary design made large-scale trawling in the ocean possible for the first time, resulting in a massive migration of fishers from the ports in the south of England, to villages further north, such as Scarborough, Hull, Grimsby, Harwich and Yarmouth, that were points of access to the large fishing grounds in the Atlantic Ocean.

The small village of Grimsby grew to become the largest fishing port in the world by the mid 19th century. An Act of Parliament was first obtained in 1796, which authorised the construction of new quays and dredging of the Haven to make it deeper. It was only in 1846, with the tremendous expansion in the fishing industry, that the Grimsby Dock Company was formed. The foundation stone for the Royal Dock was laid by Albert the Prince consort in 1849. The dock covered and was formally opened by Queen Victoria in 1854 as the first modern fishing port.

The elegant Brixham trawler spread across the world, influencing fishing fleets everywhere. By the end of the 19th century, there were over 3,000 fishing trawlers in commission in Britain, with almost 1,000 at Grimsby. These trawlers were sold to fishers around Europe, including from the Netherlands and Scandinavia. Twelve trawlers went on to form the nucleus of the German fishing fleet.

The earliest steam-powered fishing boats first appeared in the 1870s and used the trawl system of fishing as well as lines and drift nets. These were large boats, usually in length with a beam of around . They weighed 40–50 tons and travelled at . David Allen designed and made the earliest purpose-built fishing vessels in Leith, Scotland in March 1875, when he converted a drifter to steam power. In 1877, he built the first screw propelled steam trawler in the world.

Steam trawlers were introduced at Grimsby and Hull in the 1880s. In 1890 it was estimated that there were 20,000 men on the North Sea. The steam drifter was not used in the herring fishery until 1897. The last sailing fishing trawler was built in 1925 in Grimsby. Trawler designs adapted as the way they were powered changed from sail to coal-fired steam by World War I to diesel and turbines by the end of World War II.

In 1931, the first powered drum was created by Laurie Jarelainen. The drum was a circular device that was set to the side of the boat and would draw in the nets. Since World War II, radio navigation aids and fish finders have been widely used. The first trawlers fished over the side, rather than over the stern. The first purpose-built stern trawler was &quot;Fairtry&quot; built in 1953 at Aberdeen, Scotland. The ship was much larger than any other trawlers then in operation and inaugurated the era of the &#x27;super trawler&#x27;. As the ship pulled its nets over the stern, it could lift out a much greater haul of up to 60 tons. The ship served as a basis for the expansion of &#x27;super trawlers&#x27; around the world in the following decades.

===Recreational fishing===
The early evolution of fishing as recreation is not clear. For example, there is anecdotal evidence for fly fishing in Japan. However, fly fishing was likely to have been a means of survival, rather than recreation. The earliest English essay on recreational fishing was published in 1496, by Dame Juliana Berners, the prioress of the Benedictine Sopwell Nunnery. The essay was titled &quot;Treatyse of Fysshynge wyth an Angle&quot;, and included detailed information on fishing waters, the construction of rods and lines, and the use of natural baits and artificial flies.

Recreational fishing took a great leap forward after the English Civil War, where a newly found interest in the activity left its mark on the many books and treatises that were written on the subject at the time. Leonard Mascall in 1589 wrote &quot;A booke of Fishing with Hooke and Line&quot; along with many others he produced in his life on game and wildlife in England at the time. &quot;The Compleat Angler&quot; was written by Izaak Walton in 1653 (although Walton continued to add to it for a quarter of a century) and described the fishing in the Derbyshire Wye. It was a celebration of the art and spirit of fishing in prose and verse. A second part to the book was added by Walton&#x27;s friend Charles Cotton.

Charles Kirby designed an improved fishing hook in 1655 that remains relatively unchanged to this day. He went on to invent the Kirby bend, a distinctive hook with an offset point, still commonly used today.
The 18th century was mainly an era of consolidation of the techniques developed in the previous century. Running rings began to appear along the fishing rods, which gave anglers greater control over the cast line. The rods themselves were also becoming increasingly sophisticated and specialised for different roles. Jointed rods became common from the middle of the century and bamboo came to be used for the top section of the rod, giving it much greater strength and flexibility.

The industry also became commercialised – rods and tackle were sold at the haberdashers store. After the Great Fire of London in 1666, artisans moved to Redditch which became a centre of production of fishing-related products from the 1730s. Onesimus Ustonson established his shop in 1761, and his establishment remained a market leader for the next century. He received a royal warrant from three successive monarchs starting with King George IV. He also invented the multiplying winch. The commercialization of the industry came at a time of expanded interest in fishing as a recreational hobby for members of the aristocracy.

The impact of the Industrial Revolution was first felt in the manufacture of fly lines. Instead of anglers twisting their lines – a laborious and time-consuming process – the new textile spinning machines allowed for a variety of tapered lines to be easily manufactured and marketed.

British fly fishing continued to develop in the 19th century, with the emergence of fly fishing clubs, along with the appearance of several books on the subject of fly tying and fly fishing techniques.

By the mid to late 19th century, expanding leisure opportunities for the middle and lower classes began to have an effect on fly fishing, which steadily grew in mass appeal. The expansion of the railway network in Britain allowed the less affluent for the first time to take weekend trips to the seaside or rivers for fishing. Richer hobbyists ventured further abroad. The large rivers of Norway replete with large stocks of salmon began to attract fishers from England in large numbers in the middle of the century – &quot;Jones&#x27;s guide to Norway, and salmon-fisher&#x27;s pocket companion&quot;, published in 1848, was written by Frederic Tolfrey and was a popular guide to the country.
Modern reel design had begun in England during the latter part of the 18th century, and the predominant model in use was known as the &#x27;Nottingham reel&#x27;. The reel was a wide drum that spooled out freely and was ideal for allowing the bait to drift a long way out with the current. Geared multiplying reels never successfully caught on in Britain, but had more success in the United States, where George Snyder of Kentucky modified similar models into his bait-casting reel, the first American-made design in 1810.

The material used for the rod itself changed from the heavy woods native to England to lighter and more elastic varieties imported from abroad, especially from South America and the West Indies. Bamboo rods became the generally favoured option from the mid-19th century, and several strips of the material were cut from the cane, milled into shape, and then glued together to form the light, strong, hexagonal rods with a solid core that were superior to anything that preceded them. George Cotton and his predecessors fished their flies with long rods, and light lines allowing the wind to do most of the work of getting the fly to the fish.
Tackle design began to improve in the 1880s. The introduction of new woods to the manufacture of fly rods made it possible to cast flies into the wind on silk lines, instead of horse hair. These lines allowed for a much greater casting distance. However, these early fly lines proved troublesome as they had to be coated with various dressings to make them float and needed to be taken off the reel and dried every four hours or so to prevent them from becoming waterlogged. Another negative consequence was that it became easy for the much longer line to get into a tangle – this was called a &#x27;tangle&#x27; in Britain, and a &#x27;backlash&#x27; in the US. This problem spurred the invention of the regulator to evenly spool the line out and prevent tangling.

The American, Charles F. Orvis, designed and distributed a novel reel and fly design in 1874, described by reel historian Jim Brown as the &quot;benchmark of American reel design,&quot; and the first fully modern fly reel.

Albert Illingworth, 1st Baron Illingworth a textiles magnate, patented the modern form of fixed-spool spinning reel in 1905. When casting Illingworth&#x27;s reel design, the line was drawn off the leading edge of the spool but was restrained and rewound by a line pickup, a device which orbits around the stationary spool. Because the line did not have to pull against a rotating spool, much lighter lures could be cast than with conventional reels.

The development of inexpensive fiberglass rods, synthetic fly lines, and monofilament leaders in the early 1950s revived the popularity of fly fishing.
==Techniques==

There are many fishing techniques and tactics for catching fish. The term can also be applied to methods for catching other aquatic animals such as molluscs (shellfish, squid, octopus) and edible marine invertebrates.

Fishing techniques include hand gathering, spearfishing, netting, angling, bowfishing and trapping, as well as less common techniques such as gaffing, snagging, clubbing and the use of specially trained animals such as cormorants and otters. There are also destructive fishing techniques (such as electrocution, blasting and poisoning) that can do irreversible damage to the local ecosystems by killing/sterilizing entire fish stocks, habitat destruction and/or upsetting the equilibrium of interspecific competitions, and such practices are often deemed illegal and liable to criminal punishments.

Recreational, commercial and artisanal fishers use different techniques, and also, sometimes, the same techniques. Recreational fishers fish for pleasure, sport, or to provide food for themselves, while commercial fishers fish for profit. Artisanal fishers use traditional, low-tech methods, for survival in third-world countries, and as a cultural heritage in other countries. Usually, recreational fishers use angling methods and commercial fishers use netting methods. A modern development is to fish with the assistance of a drone.

Why a fish bites a baited hook or lure involves several factors related to the sensory physiology, behaviour, feeding ecology, and biology of the fish as well as the environment and characteristics of the bait/hook/lure. There is an intricate link between various fishing techniques and knowledge about the fish and their behaviour including migration, foraging and habitat. The effective use of fishing techniques often depends on this additional knowledge. Some fishers follow fishing folklores which claim that fish feeding patterns are influenced by the position of the sun and the moon.

== Tackle ==
Fishing tackles are the equipment used by fishers when fishing. Almost any equipment or gear used for fishing can be called a fishing tackle, although the term is most commonly associated with gear used in angling. Some examples are hooks, lines, sinkers, floats, rods, reels, baits, lures, spears, nets, gaffs, traps, waders, and tackle boxes. Fishing techniques refer to the ways the tackles are used when fishing.

Tackles that are attached to the end of a fishing line are collectively called terminal tackles. These include hooks, sinkers, floats, leader lines, swivels, split rings, and any wires, snaps, beads, spoons, blades, spinners and clevises used to attach spinner blades to fishing lures. People also tend to use dead or live bait fish as another form of bait.
==Fishing vessels==


A fishing vessel is a boat or ship used to catch fish in the sea, or on a lake or river. Many different kinds of vessels are used in commercial, artisanal, and recreational fishing.

According to the FAO, in 2004 there were four million commercial fishing vessels. About 1.3 million of these are decked vessels with enclosed areas. Nearly all of these decked vessels are mechanised, and 40,000 of them are over 100 tons. At the other extreme, two-thirds (1.8 million) of the undecked boats are traditional craft of various types, powered only by sail and oars. These boats are used by artisan fishers.

It is difficult to estimate how many recreational fishing boats there are, although the number is high. The term is fluid since some recreational boats may also be used for fishing from time to time. Unlike most commercial fishing vessels, recreational fishing boats are often not dedicated just to fishing. Just about anything that will stay afloat can be called a recreational fishing boat, so long as a fisher periodically climbs aboard with the intent to catch a fish. Fish are caught for recreational purposes from boats which range from dugout canoes, float tubes, kayaks, rafts, stand up paddleboards, pontoon boats and small dinghies to runabouts, cabin cruisers and cruising yachts to large, hi-tech and luxurious big game rigs. Larger boats, purpose-built with recreational fishing in mind, usually have large, open cockpits at the stern, designed for convenient fishing.
==Traditional fishing==
Traditional fishing is any kind of small scale, commercial or subsistence fishing practices using traditional techniques such as rod and tackle, arrows and harpoons, throw nets and drag nets, etc.

==Recreational fishing==

Recreational and sport fishing refer to fishing primarily for pleasure or competition. Recreational fishing has conventions, rules, licensing restrictions and laws that limit how fish may be caught; typically, these prohibit the use of nets and the catching of fish with hooks not in the mouth. The most common form of recreational fishing is done with a rod, reel, line, hooks and any one of a wide range of baits or lures such as artificial flies. The practice of catching or attempting to catch fish with a hook is generally known as angling. In angling, it is sometimes expected or required that fish be returned to the water (catch and release). Recreational or sport fishermen may log their catches or participate in fishing competitions.

The estimated global number of recreational fishers varies from 220 million to a maximum number of 700 million fishers globally, which is thought to be double the number of individuals working as commercial fishers. In the United States alone it was estimated that 50.1 million people engaged in fishing activities in both saltwater and freshwater environments.

Big-game fishing is fishing from boats to catch large open-water species such as swordfish, tuna, sharks, and marlin. Sportfishing (sometimes game fishing) is recreational fishing where the primary reward is the challenge of finding and catching the fish rather than the culinary or financial value of the fish&#x27;s flesh. Fish sought after include tarpon, sailfish, mackerel, grouper and many others.
==Fishing industry==


The fishing industry includes any industry or activity concerned with taking, culturing, processing, preserving, storing, transporting, marketing or selling fish or fish products. It is defined by the FAO as including recreational, subsistence and commercial fishing, and the harvesting, processing, and marketing sectors. The commercial activity is aimed at the delivery of fish and other seafood products for human consumption or use as raw material in other industrial processes. In 2022 24% of fishers and fish farmers and 62% of workers in post-harvest sector were women.

There are three principal industry sectors:
* The commercial sector comprises enterprises and individuals associated with wild-catch or aquaculture resources and the various transformations of those resources into products for sale.
* The traditional sector comprises enterprises and individuals associated with fisheries resources from which aboriginal people derive products following their traditions.
* The recreational sector comprises enterprises and individuals associated with the purpose of recreation, sport or sustenance with fisheries resources from which products are derived that are not for sale.

===Commercial fishing===

Commercial fishing is the capture of fish for commercial purposes. Those who practice it must often pursue fish far from the land under adverse conditions. Commercial fishermen harvest a wide range of aquatic species, from tuna, cod and salmon to shrimp, krill, lobster, clams, squid and crab, in various fisheries for these species. Commercial fishing methods have become very efficient using large nets and sea-going processing factories. Individual fishing quotas and international treaties seek to control the species and quantities caught.

A commercial fishing enterprise may vary from one person with a small boat with hand-casting nets or a few pot traps, to a huge fleet of trawlers processing tons of fish every day.

Commercial fishing gear includes weights, nets (e.g. purse seine), seine nets (e.g. beach seine), trawls (e.g. bottom trawl), dredges, hooks and line (e.g. long line and handline), lift nets, gillnets, entangling nets and traps.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the total world capture fisheries production in 2000 was 86 million tons (FAO 2002). The top producing countries were, in order, the People&#x27;s Republic of China (excluding Hong Kong and Taiwan), Peru, Japan, the United States, Chile, Indonesia, Russia, India, Thailand, Norway, and Iceland. Those countries accounted for more than half of the world&#x27;s production; China alone accounted for a third of the world&#x27;s production. Of that production, over 90% was marine and less than 10% was inland.

A small number of species support the majority of the world&#x27;s fisheries. Some of these species are herring, cod, sardine, anchovy, tuna, flounder, mullet, squid, shrimp, salmon, crab, lobster, oyster and scallops. All except these last four provided a worldwide catch of well over a million tonnes in 1999, with herring and sardines together providing a catch of over 22 million metric tons in 1999. Many other species as well are fished in smaller numbers.

===Fish farms===

Fish farming is the principal form of aquaculture, while other methods may fall under mariculture. It involves raising fish commercially in tanks or enclosures, usually for food. A facility that releases juvenile fish into the wild for recreational fishing or to supplement a species&#x27; natural population is generally referred to as a fish hatchery. Fish species raised by fish farms include salmon, carp, tilapia, catfish, white seabass and trout.

Increased demands on wild fisheries by commercial fishing has caused widespread overfishing. Fish farming offers an alternative solution to the increasing market demand for fish.

===Fish products===

Fish and fish products are consumed as food all over the world. With other seafoods, it provides the world&#x27;s prime source of high-quality protein: 14–16 percent of the animal protein consumed worldwide. Over one billion people rely on fish as their primary source of animal protein.

Fish and other aquatic organisms are also processed into various food and non-food products, such as sharkskin leather, pigments made from the inky secretions of cuttlefish, isinglass used for the clarification of wine and beer, fish emulsion used as a fertiliser, fish glue, fish oil and fish meal.

Fish are also collected live for research and the aquarium trade.

===Fish marketing===

==Fisheries management==

Fisheries management draws on fisheries science to find ways to protect fishery resources so sustainable exploitation is possible. Modern fisheries management is often referred to as a governmental system of management rules based on defined objectives and a mix of management means to implement the rules, which are put in place by a system of monitoring control and surveillance.

Fisheries science is the academic discipline of managing and understanding fisheries. It is a multidisciplinary science, which draws on the disciplines of oceanography, marine biology, marine conservation, ecology, population dynamics, economics and management in an attempt to provide an integrated picture of fisheries. In some cases new disciplines have emerged, such as bioeconomics.

===Sustainability===

Stocks fished within biologically sustainable levels decreased from 90% in 1974 to 62.3% in 2021. Issues involved in the long term sustainability of fishing include overfishing, by-catch, marine pollution, environmental effects of fishing, ghost fishing, climate change, fisheries-induced evolution and fish farming.

Conservation issues are part of marine conservation, and are addressed in fisheries science programs. There is a growing gap between how many fish are available to be caught and humanity&#x27;s desire to catch them, a problem that gets worse as the world population grows.

Similar to other environmental issues, there can be conflict between the fishermen who depend on fishing for their livelihoods and fishery scientists who realise that if future fish populations are to be sustainable then some fisheries must limit fishing or cease operations.
==Animal welfare concerns==
Historically, some doubted that fish could experience pain. Laboratory experiments have shown that fish do react to painful stimuli (e.g., injections of bee venom) in a similar way to mammals. This is controversial and has been disputed. The expansion of fish farming as well as animal welfare concerns in society has led to research into more humane and faster ways of killing fish.

In large-scale operations like fish farms, stunning fish with electricity or putting them into water saturated with nitrogen so that they cannot breathe, results in death more rapidly than just taking them out of the water. For sport fishing, it is recommended that fish be killed soon after catching them by hitting them on the head followed by bleeding out or by stabbing the brain with a sharp object (called pithing or &quot;ike jime&quot; in Japanese). Some believe it is not cruel if you release the catch back to where it was caught however a study in 2018 states that the hook damages an important part of the feeding mechanism by which the fish sucks in food, ignoring the issue of pain.

When fishing there are high chances of catching other marine wildlife in a fishing net. There are over 100 different fishing regulations on paper for reducing this bycatch.

== Plastic pollution ==
Abandoned, lost, or otherwise discarded fishing gear includes netting, mono/multifilament lines, hooks, ropes, floats, buoys, sinkers, anchors, metallic materials and fish aggregating devices (FADs) made of non-biodegradable materials such as concrete, metal and polymers. It has been estimated that global fishing gear losses each year include 5.7% of all fishing nets, 8.6% of all traps and 29% of all lines used. Abandoned, lost, or otherwise discarded fishing gear (ALDFG) can have serious impacts on marine organisms through entanglement and ingestion. The potential for fishing gear to become ALDFG depends on a number of factors including: 

* Environmental factors are mostly related to seafloor topography and obstructions, although tides, currents, waves, winds, and interaction with wildlife are also important.
* Operational losses and operator errors can occur even during normal fishing operations.
* Problems such as inadequate fisheries management and regulations that do not include adequate controls can hamper collection of ALDFG (e.g. there may be poor access to collection facilities).
* Gear loss resulting from conflicts primarily occurs (intentionally or unintentionally) in areas with high concentrations of fishing activities, leading to gear being towed away, fouled, sabotaged or vandalized. Passive and unattended gear such as pots, set gillnets and traps are particularly prone to conflict damage. In the Arctic, conflicts are the most common reason for lost gear.

==Cultural impact==

===Community===

For communities like fishing villages, fisheries provide not only a source of food and work but also a community and cultural identity.

===Economic===

Some locations may be regarded as fishing destinations, which anglers visit on vacation or for competitions. The economic impact of fishing by visitors may be a significant, or even primary driver of tourism revenue for some destinations.

===Semantic===

A &quot;fishing expedition&quot; is a situation where an interviewer implies they know more than they do to trick their target into divulging more information than they wish to reveal. Other examples of fishing terms that carry a negative connotation are: &quot;fishing for compliments&quot;, &quot;to be fooled hook, line and sinker&quot; (to be fooled beyond merely &quot;taking the bait&quot;), and the internet scam of phishing, in which a third party will duplicate a website where the user would put sensitive information (such as bank codes).

===Religious===

Fishing has had an effect on major religions, including Christianity, Hinduism, and the various new age religions. Jesus was said to participate in fishing excursions, and a number of the miracles and many parables and stories reported in the Bible involve fish or fishing. Since the Apostle Peter was a fisherman, the Catholic Church has adopted the use of the fishermans ring into the Pope&#x27;s traditional vestments.

<text>Svante August Arrhenius ( , ; 19 February 1859 – 2 October 1927) was a Swedish scientist. Originally a physicist, but often referred to as a chemist, Arrhenius was one of the founders of the science of physical chemistry. In 1903, he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, becoming the first Swedish Nobel laureate. In 1905, he became the director of the Nobel Institute, where he remained until his death.

Arrhenius was the first to use the principles of physical chemistry to estimate the extent to which increases in the atmospheric carbon dioxide are responsible for the Earth&#x27;s increasing surface temperature. His work played an important role in the emergence of modern climate science. In the 1960s, Charles David Keeling reliably measured the level of carbon dioxide present in the air showing it was increasing and that, according to the greenhouse hypothesis, it was sufficient to cause significant global warming.

The Arrhenius equation, Arrhenius acid, Arrhenius base, lunar crater Arrhenius, Martian crater Arrhenius, the mountain of Arrheniusfjellet, and the Arrhenius Labs at Stockholm University were so named to commemorate his contributions to science.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Arrhenius was born on 19 February 1859 at Vik (which can also be spelled as Wik or Wijk), near Uppsala, Kingdom of Sweden, the son of Svante Gustav and Carolina Thunberg Arrhenius, who were Lutheran. His father had been a land surveyor for Uppsala University, moving up to a supervisory position. At the age of three, Arrhenius taught himself to read without the encouragement of his parents and, by watching his father&#x27;s addition of numbers in his account books, became an arithmetical prodigy. In later life, Arrhenius was profoundly passionate about mathematical concepts, data analysis and discovering their relationships and laws.

At age eight, he entered the local cathedral school, starting in the fifth grade, distinguishing himself in physics and mathematics, and graduating as the youngest and most able student in 1876.

===Ionic disassociation===
At the University of Uppsala, he was dissatisfied with the chief instructor of physics and the only faculty member who could have supervised him in chemistry, Per Teodor Cleve, so he left to study at the Physical Institute of the Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm under the physicist Erik Edlund in 1881.

His work focused on the conductivities of electrolytes. In 1884, based on this work, he submitted a 150-page dissertation on electrolytic conductivity to Uppsala for the doctorate. It did not impress the professors, who included Cleve, and he received a fourth-class degree, but upon his defense it was reclassified as third-class. Later, extensions of this very work would earn him the 1903 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

Arrhenius put forth 56 theses in his 1884 dissertation, most of which would still be accepted today unchanged or with minor modifications. The most important idea in the dissertation was his explanation of the fact that solid crystalline salts disassociate into paired charged particles when dissolved, for which he would win the 1903 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Arrhenius&#x27;s explanation was that in forming a solution, the salt disassociates into charged particles that Michael Faraday had given the name ions many years earlier. Faraday&#x27;s belief had been that ions were produced in the process of electrolysis, that is, an external direct current source of electricity was necessary to form ions. Arrhenius proposed that, even in the absence of an electric current, aqueous solutions of salts contained ions. He thus proposed that chemical reactions in solution were reactions between ions.

The dissertation did not impress the professors at Uppsala, but Arrhenius sent it to a number of scientists in Europe who were developing the new science of physical chemistry, such as Rudolf Clausius, Wilhelm Ostwald, and Jacobus Henricus van &#x27;t Hoff. 
They were far more impressed, and Ostwald even came to Uppsala to persuade Arrhenius to join his research team in Riga. Arrhenius declined, however, as he preferred to stay in Sweden-Norway for a while (his father was very ill and would die in 1885) and had received an appointment at Uppsala.

In an extension of his ionic theory Arrhenius proposed definitions for acids and bases, in 1884. He believed that acids were substances that produce hydrogen ions in solution and that bases were substances that produce hydroxide ions in solution.

===Middle period===
In 1885, Arrhenius next received a travel grant from the Swedish Academy of Sciences, which enabled him to study with Ostwald in Riga (now in Latvia), with Friedrich Kohlrausch in Würzburg, Germany, with Ludwig Boltzmann in Graz, Austria, and with Jacobus Henricus van &#x27;t Hoff in Amsterdam.

In 1889, Arrhenius explained the fact that most reactions require added heat energy to proceed by formulating the concept of activation energy, an energy barrier that must be overcome before two molecules will react. The Arrhenius equation gives the quantitative basis of the relationship between the activation energy and the rate at which a reaction proceeds.

In 1891, he became a lecturer at the Stockholm University College (&quot;Stockholms Högskola&quot;, now Stockholm University), being promoted to professor of physics (with much opposition) in 1895, and rector in 1896.

===Nobel Prizes===
About 1900, Arrhenius became involved in setting up the Nobel Institutes and the Nobel Prizes. He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1901. For the rest of his life, he would be a member of the Nobel Committee on Physics and a de facto member of the Nobel Committee on Chemistry. He used his positions to arrange prizes for his friends (Jacobus van &#x27;t Hoff, Wilhelm Ostwald, Theodore Richards) and to attempt to deny them to his enemies (Paul Ehrlich, Walther Nernst, Dmitri Mendeleev). In 1901 Arrhenius was elected to the Swedish Academy of Sciences, against strong opposition. In 1903 he became the first Swede to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. 
In 1905, upon the founding of the Nobel Institute for Physical Research at Stockholm, he was appointed rector of the institute, the position where he remained until retirement in 1927.

In 1911, he won the first Willard Gibbs Award.

===Society memberships===
He was elected an International Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1908.

He was elected an Honorary Member of the Netherlands Chemical Society in 1909.

He became a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1910.

He was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1911.

In 1912, he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences

In 1919, he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

===Later years===

Eventually, Arrhenius&#x27;s theories became generally accepted and he turned to other scientific topics. In 1902, he began to investigate physiological problems in terms of chemical theory. He determined that reactions in living organisms and in the test tube followed the same laws.

In 1904, he delivered at the University of California a course of lectures, the object of which was to illustrate the application of the methods of physical chemistry to the study of the theory of toxins and antitoxins, and which were published in 1907 under the title &quot;Immunochemistry&quot;.
He also turned his attention to geology (the origin of ice ages), astronomy, physical cosmology, and astrophysics, accounting for the birth of the Solar System by interstellar collision. 
He considered radiation pressure as accounting for comets, the solar corona, the aurora borealis, and zodiacal light.

He thought life might have been carried from planet to planet by the transport of spores, the theory now known as panspermia. He thought of the idea of a universal language, proposing a modification of the English language.

He was a board member for the &quot;Swedish Society for Racial Hygiene&quot; (founded 1909), which endorsed mendelism at the time, and contributed to the topic of contraceptives around 1910. However, until 1938 information and sale of contraceptives was prohibited in the Kingdom of Sweden. Gordon Stein wrote that Svante Arrhenius was an atheist. In his last years he wrote both textbooks and popular books, trying to emphasize the need for further work on the topics he discussed. In September 1927, he came down with an attack of acute intestinal catarrh and died on 2 October. He was buried in Uppsala.

==Marriages and family==
He was married twice, first to his former pupil Sofia Rudbeck (1894–1896), with whom he had one son, , and then to Maria Johansson (1905–1927), with whom he had two daughters and a son.

Arrhenius was the grandfather of bacteriologist Agnes Wold, chemist Svante Wold, and ocean biogeochemist .

==Greenhouse effect==

In developing a theory to explain the ice ages, Arrhenius, in 1896, was the first to use basic principles of physical chemistry to calculate estimates of the extent to which increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) will increase Earth&#x27;s surface temperature through the greenhouse effect. These calculations led him to conclude that human-caused CO2 emissions, from fossil-fuel burning and other combustion processes, are large enough to cause global warming. This conclusion has been extensively tested, winning a place at the core of modern climate science. Arrhenius, in this work, built upon the prior work of other famous scientists, including Joseph Fourier, John Tyndall, and Claude Pouillet. Arrhenius wanted to determine whether greenhouse gases could contribute to the explanation of the temperature variation between glacial and inter-glacial periods. Arrhenius used infrared observations of the moon – by Frank Washington Very and Samuel Pierpont Langley at the Allegheny Observatory in Pittsburgh – to calculate how much of infrared (heat) radiation is captured by CO2 and water (H2O) vapour in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Using &#x27;Stefan&#x27;s law&#x27; (better known as the Stefan–Boltzmann law), he formulated what he referred to as a &#x27;rule&#x27;. 
In its original form, Arrhenius&#x27;s rule reads as follows:
::&quot;if the quantity of carbonic acid increases in geometric progression, the augmentation of the temperature will increase nearly in arithmetic progression.&quot;
Here, Arrhenius refers to CO2 as carbonic acid (which refers only to the aqueous form H2CO3 in modern usage). The following formulation of Arrhenius&#x27;s rule is still in use today:

::formula_1

where formula_2 is the concentration of CO2 at the beginning (time-zero) of the period being studied (if the same concentration unit is used for both formula_3 and formula_2, then it doesn&#x27;t matter which concentration unit is used); formula_3 is the CO2 concentration at end of the period being studied; &quot;ln&quot; is the natural logarithm (= log base e ()); and formula_6 is the augmentation of the temperature, in other words the change in the rate of heating Earth&#x27;s surface (radiative forcing), which is measured in Watts per square meter. Derivations from atmospheric radiative transfer models have found that formula_7 (alpha) for CO2 is 5.35 (± 10%) W/m2 for Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.
Based on information from his colleague Arvid Högbom, Arrhenius was the first person to predict that emissions of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels and other combustion processes were large enough to cause global warming. In his calculation Arrhenius included the feedback from changes in water vapor as well as latitudinal effects, but he omitted clouds, convection of heat upward in the atmosphere, and other essential factors. His work is currently seen less as an accurate quantification of global warming than as the first demonstration that increases in atmospheric CO2 will cause global warming, everything else being equal.

Arrhenius&#x27;s absorption values for CO2 and his conclusions met criticism by Knut Ångström in 1900, who published the first modern infrared absorption spectrum of CO2 with two absorption bands, and published experimental results that seemed to show that absorption of infrared radiation by the gas in the atmosphere was already &quot;saturated&quot; so that adding more could make no difference. Arrhenius replied strongly in 1901 (&quot;Annalen der Physik&quot;), dismissing the critique altogether. He touched on the subject briefly in a technical book titled &quot;Lehrbuch der kosmischen Physik&quot; (1903). He later wrote &quot;Världarnas utveckling&quot; (1906) (German: &quot;Das Werden der Welten&quot; [1907], English: &quot;Worlds in the Making&quot; [1908]) directed at a general audience, where he suggested that the human emission of CO2 would be strong enough to prevent the world from entering a new ice age, and that a warmer earth would be needed to feed the rapidly increasing population:

:: &quot;To a certain extent the temperature of the earth&#x27;s surface, as we shall presently see, is conditioned by the properties of the atmosphere surrounding it, and particularly by the permeability of the latter for the rays of heat.&quot; (p. 46)

:: &quot;That the atmospheric envelopes limit the heat losses from the planets had been suggested about 1800 by the great French physicist Fourier. His ideas were further developed afterwards by Pouillet and Tyndall. Their theory has been styled the hot-house theory, because they thought that the atmosphere acted after the manner of the glass panes of hot-houses.&quot; (p. 51)

:: &quot;If the quantity of carbonic acid [ CO2 + H2O → H2CO3 (carbonic acid) ] in the air should sink to one-half its present percentage, the temperature would fall by about 4°; a diminution to one-quarter would reduce the temperature by 8°. On the other hand, any doubling of the percentage of carbon dioxide in the air would raise the temperature of the earth&#x27;s surface by 4°; and if the carbon dioxide were increased fourfold, the temperature would rise by 8°.&quot; (p. 53)

:: &quot;Although the sea, by absorbing carbonic acid, acts as a regulator of huge capacity, which takes up about five-sixths of the produced carbonic acid, we yet recognize that the slight percentage of carbonic acid in the atmosphere may by the advances of industry be changed to a noticeable degree in the course of a few centuries.&quot; (p. 54)

:: &quot;Since, now, warm ages have alternated with glacial periods, even after man appeared on the earth, we have to ask ourselves: Is it probable that we shall in the coming geological ages be visited by a new ice period that will drive us from our temperate countries into the hotter climates of Africa? There does not appear to be much ground for such an apprehension. The enormous combustion of coal by our industrial establishments suffices to increase the percentage of carbon dioxide in the air to a perceptible degree.&quot; (p. 61)

:: &quot;We often hear lamentations that the coal stored up in the earth is wasted by the present generation without any thought of the future, and we are terrified by the awful destruction of life and property which has followed the volcanic eruptions of our days. We may find a kind of consolation in the consideration that here, as in every other case, there is good mixed with the evil. By the influence of the increasing percentage of carbonic acid in the atmosphere, we may hope to enjoy ages with more equable and better climates, especially as regards the colder regions of the earth, ages when the earth will bring forth much more abundant crops than at present, for the benefit of rapidly propagating mankind.&quot; (p. 63)

At this time, the accepted consensus explanation is that, historically, orbital forcing has set the timing for ice ages, with CO2 acting as an essential amplifying feedback. However, CO2 releases since the industrial revolution have increased CO2 to a level not found since 10 to 15 million years ago, when the global average surface temperature was up to warmer than now and almost all ice had melted, raising world sea-levels to about 100 feet (30 m.) higher than today&#x27;s.

Arrhenius estimated based on the CO2 levels at his time, that reducing levels by 0.62–0.55 would decrease temperatures by 4–5 °C (Celsius) and an increase of 2.5 to 3 times of CO2 would cause a temperature rise of 8–9 °C in the Arctic. In his book &quot;Worlds in the Making&quot; he described the &quot;hot-house&quot; theory of the atmosphere.

<text>UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD) is an intergovernmental organization within the United Nations Secretariat that promotes the interests of developing countries in world trade. It was established in 1964 by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) as the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development but rebranded to its current name on the occasion of its 60th anniversary in 2024. It reports to both the General Assembly and the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). UNCTAD is composed of 195 member states and works with non-governmental organizations worldwide; its permanent secretariat is at UNOG in Geneva, Switzerland.

The primary objective of UNCTAD is to formulate policies relating to all aspects of development, including trade, aid, transport, finance and technology. It was created in response to concerns among developing countries that existing international institutions like GATT (since replaced by the World Trade Organization), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank were not properly organized to handle the particular problems of developing countries; UNCTAD would provide a forum where developing nations could discuss and address problems relating to their economic development.

One of UNCTAD&#x27;s principal achievements was conceiving and implementing the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), which promotes the export of manufactured goods from developing countries. In the 1970s and 1980s, UNCTAD was closely associated with the New International Economic Order (NIEO), a set of proposals that sought to reduce economic dependency and inequality between developing and developed countries.

UNCTAD conferences ordinarily take place every four years, with the first occurring in Geneva in 1964; fifteen subsequent meetings have taken place worldwide, with the most recent held in Bridgetown, Barbados, from 3–8 October 2021 (albeit virtually, due to the COVID-19 pandemic).

UNCTAD has 400 staff members and a biannual (2010–2011) regular budget of US$138 million in core expenditures and US$72 million in extra-budgetary technical assistance funds. It is a member of the United Nations Sustainable Development Group, a consortium of UN entities that work to promote sustainable socioeconomic development.

==Membership==
As of May 2018, UNCTAD has 195 member states: all UN members plus UN observer states Palestine and the Holy See. UNCTAD members are divided into four categories based on United Nations Regional Groups, with six members unassigned: Kiribati, Nauru, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tuvalu. List A consists mostly of countries in the UN&#x27;s African Group and Asia-Pacific Group. List B consists of countries of the Western European and Others Group. List C consists of countries of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States (GRULAC). List D consists of countries of the Eastern European Group.

The lists, originally defined in 19th General Assembly resolution 1995 serve to balance geographical distribution of member states&#x27; representation on the Trade Development Board and other UNCTAD structures. The lists are similar to those of UNIDO, a UN specialized agency.

The most recent member is Palestine

The full list is as follows:
:List A (100 members): Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Benin, Bhutan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brunei Darussalam, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, China, Comoros, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Republic of Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kenya, Kuwait, Laos, Lebanon, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, Marshall Islands, Mauritania, Mauritius, Micronesia, Mongolia, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, North Korea, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Qatar, Rwanda, Samoa, Sao Tome and Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, Vanuatu, Viet Nam, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe.

:List D (24 members): Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, Poland, Moldova, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Macedonia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan.

:Not assigned countries (6 members): Kiribati, Nauru, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tuvalu.

Other states that do not participate are Cook Islands, Niue, and the states with limited recognition.

==Meetings==
The inter-governmental work is done at five levels of meetings:
* The UNCTAD Conference – held every four years:

* The UNCTAD Trade and Development Board – the board manages the work of UNCTAD between two conferences and meets up to three times every year.
* Four UNCTAD Commissions and one Working Party – these meet more often than the board to take up policy, programme and budgetary issues.
* Expert Meetings – the commissions will convene expert meetings on selected topics to provide substantive and expert input for Commission policy discussions.

The 15th quadrennial meeting took place virtually in Bridgetown, Barbados, from 25 to 30 April 2021.

=== Geneva, 1964 ===
In response to developing countries (Least Developed Country, LDC) anxiety at their worsening position in world trade, the United Nations General Assembly voted for a &#x27;one-off&#x27; conference. These early discussions paved the way for new IMF facilities to provide finance for shortfalls in commodity earnings and for the Generalised Preference Schemes which increased access to Northern markets for manufactured imports from the South. At Geneva, the LDCs were successful in their proposal for the conference with its secretariat to become a permanent organ of the UN, with meetings every four years. At the Geneva meeting, Raúl Prebisch—a prominent Argentinian economist from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC)—became the organization&#x27;s first secretary-general.

=== New Delhi, 1968 ===
The New Delhi Conference, held in February and March 1968, was a forum that allowed developing countries to reach an agreement on the basic principles of their development policies. The conference in New Delhi was an opportunity for schemes to be finally approved. The conference provided a major impetus in persuading the North to follow up on UNCTAD I resolutions, in establishing generalized preferences. The target for private and official flows to LDCs was raised to 1% of the North&#x27;s GNP, but the developed countries failed to achieve the target by a specific date. This has proven a continuing point of debate at UNCTAD conferences.

The conference led to the International Sugar Agreement, which seeks to stabilize world sugar prices.

=== Santiago, 1972 ===
The Santiago Conference, 15 April 1972, was the third occasion on which developing countries confronted the rich with the need to use trade and aid measures more effectively to improve living standards in the developing world. Discussion centred on the international monetary system and specifically on the South&#x27;s proposal that a higher proportion of new special drawing rights (SDRs) should be allocated to LDCs as a form of aid (the so-called &#x27;link&#x27;). In Santiago, substantial disagreements arose within the Group of 77 (G77) despite preconference meetings. There was disagreement over the SDR proposal and between those in the G77 who wanted fundamental changes such as a change in the voting allocations in the South&#x27;s favour at the IMF and those (mainly the Latin American countries) who wanted much milder reforms. This internal dissent seriously weakened the group&#x27;s negotiating position and led to a final agreed motion which recommended that the IMF should examine the link and that further research be conducted into general reforms. This avoided firm commitments to act on the &#x27;link&#x27; or general reform, and the motion was passed by the conference.

=== Nairobi, 1976, and Manila, 1979 ===
UNCTAD IV, held in Nairobi in May 1976, showed relative success compared to its predecessors. An Overseas Development Institute briefing paper of April 1979 highlights one reason for success as being down to the 1973 Oil Crisis and the encouragement of LDCs to make gains through producers of other commodities. The principal result of the conference was the adoption of the Integrated Programme for Commodities. The programme covered the principal commodity exports and its objectives aside from the stabilisation of commodity prices were: &quot;Just and remunerative pricing, taking into account world inflation&quot;, the expansion of processing, distribution and control of technology by LDCs and improved access to markets.

UNCTAD V, held in Manila in 1979 in the wake of the Nairobi Conference, focused on the key issues of protectionism in developing countries and the need for structural change, trade in commodities and manufacturing aid and international monetary reform, technology, shipping, and economic co-operation among developing countries. An Overseas Development Institute briefing paper written in 1979 focuses its attention on the key issues regarding the LDCs&#x27; role as the Group of 77 in the international community.

=== Belgrade, 1983 ===
The sixth UN Conference on Trade and Development in Belgrade, 6–30 June 1983, was held against the background of earlier UNCTADs which have substantially failed to resolve many of the disagreements between the developed and developing countries and of a world economy in its worst recession since the early 1930s. The key issues of the time were finance and adjustment, commodity price stabilisation and trade.

=== Bridgetown, 2021 ===
The fifteenth session of UNCTAD was originally scheduled for 2020 but was delayed until 2021 due to COVID-19.
This was the first time the conference was held in a Small Island Developing State (SIDS).

== Achievements ==
One of UNCTAD&#x27;s earliest and most notable accomplishments was the formulation and implementation of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), which offered special tariff concessions to exports of manufactured goods by developing countries. Accepting this argument, the developed countries formulated the GSP scheme under which manufacturers&#x27; exports and imports of some agricultural goods from the developing countries enter duty-free or at reduced rates in the developed countries. Since imports of such items from other developed countries are subject to the normal rates of duties, imports of the same items from developing countries would enjoy a competitive advantage.

==Reports==
UNCTAD produces a number of topical reports, including:
* The Trade and Development Report
* The Trade and Environment Review
* The World Investment Report
* The Economic Development in Africa Report
* The Least Developed Countries Report
* UNCTAD Statistics
* Digital Economy Report (formerly known as the &quot;Information Economy Report)&quot;
* The Review of Maritime Transport
* The International Accounting and Reporting Issues Annual Review
* The Technology and Innovation Report

==Other==
UNCTAD conducts technical cooperation programmes such as ASYCUDA, DMFAS, EMPRETEC and WAIPA.

In addition, UNCTAD conducts certain technical cooperation in collaboration with the World Trade Organization through the joint International Trade Centre (ITC), a technical cooperation agency targeting operational and enterprise-oriented aspects of trade development.

UNCTAD hosts the Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting (ISAR).

===Partnership initiatives===
UNCTAD is a founding member of the United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchanges (SSE) initiative along with the Principles for Responsible Investment, the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP-FI), and the UN Global Compact.

<text>Virgil Ivan &quot;Gus&quot; Grissom (April 3, 1926 – January 27, 1967) was an American engineer and pilot in the United States Air Force, as well as one of the original men, the Mercury Seven, selected by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for Project Mercury, a program to train and launch astronauts into outer space. Grissom was also a Project Gemini and Apollo program astronaut for NASA. As a member of the NASA Astronaut Corps, Grissom was the second American to fly in space in 1961. He was also the second American to fly in space twice, preceded only by Joe Walker with his sub-orbital X-15 flights.

Grissom was a World War II and Korean War veteran, mechanical engineer, and USAF test pilot. He was a recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal with an oak leaf cluster, two NASA Distinguished Service Medals, and, posthumously, the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.

As commander of &quot;AS-204&quot; (Apollo 1), Grissom died with astronauts Ed White and Roger B. Chaffee on January 27, 1967, during a pre-launch test for the Apollo 1 mission at Cape Kennedy, Florida.

== Early life ==
Virgil Ivan Grissom was born in the small town of Mitchell, Indiana, on April 3, 1926, to Dennis David Grissom (1903–1994), a signalman for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and Cecile King Grissom (1901–1995), a homemaker. Virgil was the family&#x27;s second child (an older sister died in infancy shortly before his birth). He was followed by three younger siblings: a sister, Wilma, and two brothers, Norman and Lowell. Grissom started school at Riley grade school. His interest in flying began during that time, building model airplanes. He received his nickname when his friend was reading his name on a scorecard upside down and misread &quot;Griss&quot; as &quot;Gus&quot;.

As a youth, Grissom attended the local Church of Christ, where he remained a lifelong member. He joined the local Boy Scout Troop and earned the rank of Star Scout. Grissom credited the Scouts for his love of hunting and fishing. He was the leader of the honor guard in his troop. His first jobs were delivering newspapers for &quot;The Indianapolis Star&quot; in the morning and the &quot;Bedford Times&quot; in the evening. In the summer he picked fruit in area orchards and worked at a dry-goods store. He also worked at a local meat market, a service station, and a clothing store in Mitchell.

Grissom started attending Mitchell High School in 1940. He wanted to play varsity basketball but he was too short. His father encouraged him to find sports he was more suited for, and he joined the swimming team. Although he excelled at mathematics, Grissom was an average high school student in other subjects. He graduated from high school in 1944.

In addition, Grissom occasionally spent time at a local airport in Bedford, Indiana, where he first became interested in aviation. A local attorney who owned a small plane would take him on flights and taught him the basics of flying.

Grissom was a Freemason.

== World War II ==
World War II began while Grissom was still in high school, but he was eager to join the armed services upon graduation. Grissom enlisted as an aviation cadet in the U.S. Army Air Forces during his senior year in high school, and completed an entrance exam in November 1943. Grissom was inducted into the U.S. Army Air Forces on August 8, 1944, at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana. He was sent to Sheppard Field in Wichita Falls, Texas, for five weeks of basic flight training, and was later stationed at Brooks Field in San Antonio, Texas. In January 1945 Grissom was assigned to Boca Raton Army Airfield in Florida. Although he was interested in becoming a pilot, most of Grissom&#x27;s time before his discharge in 1945 was spent as a clerk.

== Post-war employment ==
Grissom was discharged from military service in November 1945, after the war had ended, and returned to Mitchell, where he took a job at Carpenter Body Works, a local bus manufacturing business. Grissom was determined to make his career in aviation and attend college. Using the G.I. Bill for partial payment of his school tuition, Grissom enrolled at Purdue University in September 1946.

Due to a shortage of campus housing during her husband&#x27;s first semester in college in West Lafayette, Indiana, Grissom&#x27;s wife, Betty, stayed in Mitchell living with her parents, while Grissom lived in a rented apartment with another male student. Betty Grissom joined her husband on campus during his second semester, and the couple settled into a small, one-bedroom apartment. Grissom continued his studies at Purdue, worked part-time as a cook at a local restaurant, and took summer classes to finish college early, while his wife worked the night shift as a long-distance operator for the Indiana Bell Telephone Company to help pay for his schooling and their living expenses. Grissom graduated from Purdue with a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering in February 1950.

== Korean War ==

After he graduated from Purdue, Grissom re-enlisted in the newly formed U.S. Air Force. He was accepted into the Air Cadet Basic Training Program at Randolph Air Force Base in Universal City, Texas. Upon completion of the program, he was assigned to Williams Air Force Base in Mesa, Arizona, where his wife, Betty, and infant son, Scott, joined him, but the family remained there only briefly. In March 1951, Grissom received his pilot wings and a commission as a second lieutenant. Nine months later, in December 1951, Grissom and his family moved into new living quarters in Presque Isle, Maine, where he was assigned to Presque Isle Air Force Base and became a member of the 75th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron.

With the ongoing Korean War, Grissom&#x27;s squadron was dispatched to the war zone in February 1952. There he flew as an F-86 Sabre replacement pilot and was reassigned to the 334th Fighter Squadron of the 4th Fighter Interceptor Wing stationed at Kimpo Air Base. He flew one hundred combat missions during approximately six months of service in Korea, including multiple occasions when he broke up air raids from North Korean MiGs. On March 11, 1952, Grissom was promoted to first lieutenant and was cited for his &quot;superlative airmanship&quot; for his actions on March 23, 1952, when he flew cover for a photo reconnaissance mission. Grissom was also awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with an oak leaf cluster for his military service in Korea.

After flying his quota of one hundred missions, Grissom asked to remain in Korea to fly another twenty-five flights, but his request was denied. Grissom returned to the United States to serve as a flight instructor at Bryan AFB in Bryan, Texas, where he was joined by his wife, Betty, and son, Scott. The Grissoms&#x27; second child, Mark, was born there in 1953. Grissom soon learned that flight instructors faced their own set of on-the-job risks. During a training exercise with a cadet, the trainee pilot caused a flap to break off from their two-seat trainer, sending it into a roll. Grissom quickly climbed from the rear seat of the small aircraft to take over the controls and safely land it.

In August 1955, Grissom was reassigned to the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio of Air University. After completing the year-long course he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in aeromechanics in 1956. In October 1956, he entered the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base in California, and returned to Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio in May 1957, after attaining the rank of captain. Grissom served as a test pilot assigned to the fighter branch.

== NASA career ==
In 1959, Grissom received an official teletype message instructing him to report to an address in Washington, D.C., wearing civilian clothes. The message was classified &quot;Top Secret&quot; and Grissom was ordered not to discuss its contents with anyone. Of the 508 military candidates who were considered, he was one of 110 test pilots whose credentials had earned them an invitation to learn more about the U.S. space program in general and its Project Mercury. Grissom was intrigued by the program, but knew that competition for the final spots would be fierce.

Grissom passed the initial screening in Washington, D.C., and was among the thirty-nine candidates sent to the Lovelace Clinic in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and the Aeromedical Laboratory of the Wright Air Development Center in Dayton, Ohio, to undergo extensive physical and psychological testing. He was nearly disqualified when doctors discovered that he suffered from hay fever, but was permitted to continue after he argued that his allergies would not be a problem due to the absence of ragweed pollen in space.

On April 13, 1959, Grissom received official notification that he had been selected as one of the seven Project Mercury astronauts. Grissom and the six other men, after taking a leave of absence from their respective branches of the military service, reported to the Special Task Group at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia on April 27, 1959, to begin their astronaut training.

=== Project Mercury ===

On July 21, 1961, Grissom was pilot of the second Project Mercury flight, Mercury-Redstone 4. Grissom named his spacecraft &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot; after the Liberty Bell, and drew a crack on it as a nod to the bell. &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot; was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, a sub-orbital flight that lasted 15 minutes and 37 seconds. After splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean, the &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot;″s emergency explosive bolts unexpectedly fired, blowing off the hatch and causing water to flood into the spacecraft. Grissom quickly exited through the open hatch and into the ocean. While waiting for recovery helicopters from to pick him up, Grissom struggled to keep from drowning after his spacesuit began losing buoyancy due to an open air inlet. Grissom managed to stay afloat until he was pulled from the water by a helicopter and taken to the U.S. Navy ship. In the meantime another recovery helicopter tried to lift and retrieve the &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot;, but the flooding spacecraft became too heavy, forcing the recovery crew to cut it loose, and it ultimately sank.

When reporters at a news conference surrounded Grissom after his space flight to ask how he felt, Grissom replied, &quot;Well, I was scared a good portion of the time; I guess that&#x27;s a pretty good indication.&quot; Grissom stated he had done nothing to cause the hatch to blow, and no definitive explanation for the incident was found. Robert F. Thompson, director of Mercury operations, was dispatched to by Space Task Group Director Robert Gilruth and spoke with Grissom upon his arrival on the aircraft carrier. Grissom explained that he had gotten ahead in the mission timeline and had removed the detonator cap, and also pulled the safety pin. Once the pin was removed, the trigger was no longer held in place and could have inadvertently fired as a result of ocean wave action, bobbing as a result of helicopter rotor wash, or other activity. NASA officials concluded Grissom had not necessarily initiated the firing of the explosive hatch, which would have required pressing a plunger that required five pounds of force to depress. Hitting this metal trigger with the hand typically left a large bruise, but Grissom was found not to have any of the telltale hand bruising.

While the debate continued about the premature detonation of &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot;&#x27;s hatch bolts, precautions were initiated for subsequent flights. Fellow Mercury astronaut Wally Schirra, at the end of his October 3, 1962, flight, remained inside his spacecraft until it was safely aboard the recovery ship, and made a point of deliberately blowing the hatch to get out of the spacecraft, bruising his hand.

Grissom&#x27;s spacecraft was recovered in 1999, but no evidence was found that could conclusively explain how the explosive hatch release had occurred. Later, Guenter Wendt, pad leader for the early American crewed space launches, wrote that he believed a small cover over the external release actuator was accidentally lost sometime during the flight or splashdown. Another possible explanation was that the hatch&#x27;s T-handle may have been tugged by a stray parachute suspension line, or was perhaps damaged by the heat of re-entry, and after cooling upon splashdown it contracted and caught fire. It has also been suggested that a static electricity discharge during initial contact between the spacecraft and the rescue helicopter may have caused the hatch&#x27;s explosive bolts to blow. The co-pilot of the helicopter, U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant John Reinhard, had the job of using a cutting pole to snip off an antenna before the helicopter could latch onto the capsule. In the 1990s, he told a researcher that he remembered seeing an electric arc jump between the capsule and his pole right before the hatch blew. Jim Lewis, the pilot of Grissom&#x27;s rescue helicopter, told &quot;Smithsonian Magazine&quot; that closer inspection of film footage made him remember the day in better detail. He recalled that &quot;Reinhard must have cut the antenna a mere second or two before I got us in a position for him to attach our harness to the capsule lifting bale,&quot; indicating that the timing of the helicopter&#x27;s approach aligned with the static discharge theory.

=== Project Gemini ===

In early 1964, Alan Shepard was grounded after being diagnosed with Ménière&#x27;s disease and Grissom was designated command pilot for Gemini 3, the first crewed Project Gemini flight, which flew on March 23, 1965. This mission made Grissom the first human and thus first NASA astronaut to fly into space twice. The two-man flight on Gemini 3 with Grissom and John W. Young made three revolutions of the Earth and lasted for 4 hours, 52 minutes and 31 seconds. Grissom was one of the eight pilots of the NASA paraglider research vehicle (Paresev).

Grissom, the shortest of the original seven astronauts at five feet seven inches tall, worked very closely with the engineers and technicians from McDonnell Aircraft who built the Gemini spacecraft. Because of his involvement in the design of the first three spacecraft, his fellow astronauts humorously referred to the craft as &quot;the Gusmobile&quot;. By July 1963 NASA discovered 14 out of its 16 astronauts could not fit themselves into the cabin and the later cockpits were modified. During this time Grissom invented the multi-axis translation thruster controller used to push the Gemini and Apollo spacecraft in linear directions for rendezvous and docking.

In a joking nod to the sinking of his Mercury craft, Grissom named the first Gemini spacecraft &quot;Molly Brown&quot; (after the popular Broadway show, &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot;). Some NASA publicity officials were unhappy with this name and asked Grissom and his pilot, John Young, to come up with a new one. When they offered &quot;Titanic&quot; as an alternate, NASA executives decided to allow them to use the name of &quot;Molly Brown&quot; for Gemini 3, but did not use it in official references. Much to the agency&#x27;s chagrin, CAPCOM Gordon Cooper gave Gemini 3 its sendoff on launch with the remark to Grissom and Young, &quot;You&#x27;re on your way, &quot;Molly Brown&quot;!&quot; Ground controllers also used it to refer to the spacecraft throughout its flight.

After the safe return of Gemini 3, NASA announced new spacecraft would not be nicknamed. Hence, Gemini 4 was not called &quot;American Eagle&quot; as its crew had planned. The practice of nicknaming spacecraft resumed in 1967, when managers realized that the Apollo flights needed a name for each of two flight elements, the Command Module (CSM) and the Lunar Module. Lobbying by the astronauts and senior NASA administrators also had an effect. Apollo 9 used the name &quot;Gumdrop&quot; for the Command Module and &quot;Spider&quot; for the Lunar Module. However, Wally Schirra was prevented from naming his Apollo 7 spacecraft &quot;Phoenix&quot; in honor of the Apollo 1 crew because some believed that its nickname as a metaphor for &quot;fire&quot; might be misunderstood.

=== Apollo program ===
Grissom was backup command pilot for Gemini 6A when he was transferred to the Apollo program and was assigned as commander of the first crewed mission, AS-204, with Senior Pilot Ed White, who had flown in space on the Gemini 4 mission, when he became the first American to make a spacewalk, and Pilot Roger B. Chaffee. The three men were granted permission to refer to their flight as &quot;Apollo 1&quot; on their mission insignia patch.

Problems with the simulator proved extremely annoying to Grissom, who told a reporter the problems with Apollo 1 came &quot;in bushelfuls&quot; and that he was skeptical of its chances to complete its fourteen-day mission. Grissom earned the nickname &quot;Gruff Gus&quot; by being outspoken about the technical deficiencies of the spacecraft. The engineers who programmed the Apollo training simulator had a difficult time keeping the simulator in sync with the continuous changes being made to the spacecraft. According to backup astronaut Walter Cunningham, &quot;We knew that the spacecraft was, you know, in poor shape relative to what it ought to be. We felt like we could fly it, but let&#x27;s face it, it just wasn&#x27;t as good as it should have been for the job of flying the first crewed Apollo mission.&quot;

NASA pressed on. In mid-January 1967, &quot;preparations were being made for the final pre-flight tests of Spacecraft 012.&quot; On January 22, 1967, before returning to Cape Kennedy to conduct the January 27 plugs-out test that ended his life, Grissom&#x27;s wife, Betty, later recalled that he took a lemon from a tree in his back yard and explained that he intended to hang it on that spacecraft, although he actually hung the lemon on the simulator (a duplicate of the Apollo spacecraft).

== Personal life ==

Grissom met Betty Lavonne Moore (1927–2018), in high school. They were married on July 6, 1945, at First Baptist Church in Mitchell when he was home on leave during World War II. The couple had two sons, Scott (1950), and Mark (1953).
Two of Grissom&#x27;s pastimes were hunting and fishing. The family also enjoyed water sports and skiing.

== Death ==
Before Apollo 1&#x27;s planned launch on February 21, 1967, the Command Module interior caught fire and burned on January 27, 1967, during a pre-launch test on Launch Pad 34 at Cape Kennedy. Astronauts Grissom, White, and Chaffee, who were working inside the closed Command Module, were asphyxiated. During the test, Grissom said, &quot;How are we going to get to the Moon if we can&#x27;t talk between two or three buildings,&quot; then shouted &quot;fire!&quot; The fire&#x27;s ignition source was damaged wiring. The pilots&#x27; deaths were attributed to lethal hazards in the early CSM design and conditions of the test, including a pressurized 100 percent oxygen prelaunch atmosphere, wiring and plumbing flaws, flammable materials used in the cockpit and in the astronauts&#x27; flight suits, and an inward-opening hatch that could not be opened quickly in an emergency and not at all with full internal pressure.

Grissom&#x27;s funeral services and burial at Arlington National Cemetery were held on January 31, 1967. Dignitaries in attendance included President Lyndon B. Johnson, members of the U.S. Congress, and fellow NASA astronauts, among others. Grissom was interred at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington County, Virginia, beside Roger Chaffee. White&#x27;s remains are interred at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York.

== Legacy ==
After the accident, NASA decided to give the flight the official designation of Apollo 1 and skip to Apollo 4 for the first uncrewed flight of the Saturn V, counting the two uncrewed suborbital tests, AS-201 and 202, as part of the sequence. The Apollo spacecraft problems were corrected, with Apollo 7, commanded by Wally Schirra, launched on October 11, 1968, more than a year and a half after the Apollo 1 accident. The Apollo program reached its objective of successfully landing men on the Moon on July 20, 1969, with Apollo 11.

At the time of his death, Grissom had attained the rank of lieutenant colonel and had logged a total of 4,600 hours flying time, including 3,500 hours in jet airplanes. Some contend that Grissom could have been selected as one of the astronauts to walk on the Moon. Deke Slayton wrote that he had hoped for one of the original Mercury astronauts to go to the Moon, noting: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t just a cut-and-dried decision as to who should make the first steps on the Moon. If I had to select on that basis, my first choice would have been Gus, which both Chris Kraft and Bob Gilruth seconded.&quot; Ultimately, Alan Shepard, one of the original seven NASA astronauts, would receive the honor of commanding the Apollo 14 lunar landing.

== &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot; spacesuit controversy ==

When the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame opened in 1990, his family lent it the spacesuit worn by Grissom during Mercury 4 along with other personal artifacts belonging to the astronaut. In 2002, the museum went into bankruptcy and was taken over by a NASA contractor, whereupon the family sought the exhibit&#x27;s return. All the artifacts were returned to them except the spacesuit, which NASA claimed was government property. NASA insisted Grissom got authorization to use the spacesuit for a show and tell at his son&#x27;s school in 1965 and never returned it, but some of Grissom&#x27;s family members claimed the astronaut rescued the spacesuit from a scrap heap. the space suit was part of the Kennedy Space Center Hall of Fame&#x27;s Heroes and Legends exhibit.

== Awards and honors ==


* John J. Montgomery Award

To celebrate his spaceflight in 1961, Grissom was made honorary Mayor of Newport News, Virginia, and a new library was dubbed the Virgil I. Grissom Library in the Denbigh section of Newport News, Virginia.

The airport in Bedford, Indiana, where Grissom flew as a teenager was renamed Virgil I. Grissom Municipal Airport in 1965. A three-ton piece of limestone, inscribed with his name, was unveiled at the airport. His fellow astronauts ribbed him about the name, saying that airports were normally named for dead aviators. Grissom replied, &quot;But this time they&#x27;ve named one for a live one.&quot; Virgil Grissom Elementary School in Old Bridge, New Jersey, was named for Grissom the year before his death. His death forced the cancellation of a student project to design a flag to represent Grissom and their school, which would have flown on the mission.

Grissom was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal for his Mercury flight and was awarded it a second time for his role in Gemini 3. The Apollo 1 crew was awarded the medal posthumously in a 1969 presentation of the Presidential Medal of Freedom to the Apollo 11 crew.

Grissom&#x27;s family received the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978 from President Carter (White&#x27;s and Chaffee&#x27;s families received it in 1997).

Grissom was granted an honorary doctorate from Florida Institute of Technology in 1962, the first-ever awarded by the university. Grissom was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1981, and the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1987. Grissom was posthumously inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1990. His wife, Betty Lavonne Moore, donated his Congressional Space Medal of Honor to the accompanying museum.

Grissom posthumously received AIAA&#x27;s Haley Astronautics Award for 1968.

== Memorials ==

The dismantled Launch Pad 34 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station bears two memorial plaques to the crew of Apollo 1. The Kennedy Space Center features a memorial exhibit honoring the Apollo 1 crew in the Apollo/Saturn V Center, which includes artifacts and personal mementos of Grissom, Chaffee, and White. Grissom&#x27;s name is included on the plaque left on the Moon with the &quot;Fallen Astronaut&quot; statue in 1971 by the crew of Apollo 15.

The Grissom Memorial, a tall limestone monument representing the Redstone rocket and his Mercury space capsule was dedicated in downtown Mitchell, Indiana, in 1981. The Virgil I. Grissom Memorial in Spring Mill State Park, near Grissom&#x27;s hometown of Mitchell, Indiana, was dedicated in 1971, the tenth anniversary of his Mercury flight. The governor declared it a state holiday for the second year in a row. The &quot;Gus Grissom Stakes&quot; is a thoroughbred horse race run in Indiana each fall; originally held at Hoosier Park in Anderson, it was moved to Horseshoe Indianapolis in Shelbyville in 2014.

Grissom Island is an artificial island off of Long Beach, California, created in 1966 for drilling oil (along with White, Chaffee and Freeman Islands). Virgil &quot;Gus&quot; Grissom Park opened in 1971 in Fullerton, California. His widow and son were invited to the dedication ceremony and planted the first large tree in the park. Grissom is named with his Apollo 1 crewmates on the Space Mirror Memorial, which was dedicated in 1991. His son, Gary Grissom, said, &quot;When I was younger, I thought NASA would do something. It&#x27;s a shame it has taken this long&quot;.

&quot;Navi&quot; (&quot;Ivan&quot; spelled backwards), is a seldom-used nickname for the star Gamma Cassiopeiae. Grissom used this name, plus two others for White and Chaffee, on his Apollo 1 mission planning star charts as a joke, and the succeeding Apollo astronauts kept using the names as a memorial. Grissom crater is one of several located on the far side of the Moon named for Apollo astronauts. The name was created and used unofficially by the Apollo 8 astronauts and was adopted as the official name by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1970. 2161 Grissom is a main belt asteroid that was discovered in 1963 and officially designated in 1981. The name references his launch date of July 21, 1961. &quot;Grissom Hill&quot;, one of the &quot;Apollo 1 Hills&quot; on Mars was named by NASA on January 27, 2004, the 37th anniversary of the Apollo 1 fire.

Bunker Hill Air Force Base in Peru, Indiana, was renamed on May 12, 1968, to &quot;Grissom Air Force Base&quot;. During the dedication ceremony, his son said, &quot;Of all the honors he won, none would please him more than this one today.&quot; In 1994, it was again renamed to &quot;Grissom Air Reserve Base&quot; following the USAF&#x27;s realignment program. The three-letter identifier of the VHF Omni Directional Radio Range (VOR) located at Grissom Air Reserve Base is GUS. In 2000, classes of the United States Air Force Academy began selecting a Class Exemplar who embodies the type of person they strive to be. The class of 2007 selected Grissom. An academic building was renamed Grissom Hall in 1968 at the former Chanute Air Force Base, Rantoul, Illinois, where Minuteman missile maintenance training was conducted. It was one of five buildings renamed for deceased Air Force personnel.

The Virgil I. Grissom Museum, dedicated in 1971 by Governor Edgar Whitcomb, is located just inside the entrance to Spring Mill State Park in Mitchell, Indiana. The &quot;Molly Brown&quot; was transferred to be displayed in the museum in 1974. His boyhood home in Mitchell, Indiana, is located on Grissom Avenue. The street was renamed in his honor after his Mercury flight.

=== Schools ===
Florida Institute of Technology dedicated Grissom Hall, a residence hall, in 1967. State University of New York at Fredonia dubbed their new residence hall Grissom Hall in 1967. Grissom Hall, dedicated in 1968 at Purdue University, was the home of the School of Aeronautics and Astronautics for several decades. It is currently home of the Purdue department of Industrial Engineering.

Virgil I. Grissom Elementary School was built in Houston, Texas, in 1967. Virgil Grissom Elementary School in Princeton, Iowa was one of four schools in Iowa named after astronauts in late 1967. Grissom&#x27;s family members attended the 1968 dedication of Virgil I. Grissom Middle School in Mishawaka, Indiana. School No. 7 in Rochester, New York, was named for Grissom in April 1968. Devault Elementary School in Gary, Indiana, was renamed Grissom Elementary School in 1969 after Devault was convicted of conspiring to forge purchase orders. Virgil I. Grissom Middle School was dedicated in November 1969 in Sterling Heights, Michigan. Virgil I. Grissom High School was built in 1969 in Huntsville, Alabama. The school board in the Hegewisch community of Chicago, Illinois, voted to name their new school under construction Virgil I. Grissom Elementary School in March 1969. Grissom Elementary School in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was founded in 1969 and dedicated by Betty Grissom in 1970. Grissom Memorial Elementary School was dedicated in 1973 in Muncie, Indiana. Virgil I. Grissom Middle School was founded in Tinley Park, Illinois, in 1975.

Virgil I. &quot;Gus&quot; Grissom Elementary School was operated by the Department of Defense Dependents Schools at the former Clark Air Base, Philippines. Originally named the Wurtsmith Hill School, it was renamed on November 14, 1968. It housed 3rd and 4th grade students. The school was severely damaged by the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in 1991.

== Film and television ==
Grissom has been noted and remembered in many film and television productions. Before he became widely known as an astronaut, the film &quot;Air Cadet&quot; (1951) starring Richard Long and Rock Hudson briefly featured Grissom early in the movie as a U.S. Air Force candidate for flight school at Randolph Field, San Antonio, Texas. Grissom was depicted by Fred Ward in the film &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; (1983) and (very briefly) in the film &quot;Apollo 13&quot; (1995) by Steve Bernie. He was portrayed in the 1998 HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; (1998) by Mark Rolston. Actor Kevin McCorkle played Grissom in the third-season finale of the NBC television show &quot;American Dreams&quot;. Bryan Cranston played Grissom as a variety-show guest in the film &quot;That Thing You Do!&quot; Actor Joel Johnstone portrays Gus Grissom in the 2015 ABC TV series &quot;The Astronaut Wives Club&quot;. In 2016 Gus Grissom was included in the narrative of the movie &quot;Hidden Figures&quot;. In 2018, he was portrayed by Shea Whigham in &quot;First Man&quot;. In 2020&#x27;s Disney+ miniseries &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;, Grissom is portrayed by Michael Trotter.

In the 1984 film &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot;, the Federation starship USS &quot;Grissom&quot; is named for Grissom. Another USS &quot;Grissom&quot; was featured in a 1990 episode of the TV series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, and was mentioned in a 1999 episode of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. The character Gil Grissom in the CBS television series &quot;&quot; and the character Virgil Tracy in the British television series &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; are also named after the astronaut. NASA footage, including Grissom&#x27;s Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo missions, was released in high definition on the Discovery Channel in June 2008 in the television series &quot;When We Left Earth: The NASA Missions&quot;.

When Grissom died, he was in the process of writing a book about Gemini.

<text>Edward Higgins White II (November 14, 1930 – January 27, 1967) was an American aeronautical engineer, United States Air Force officer, test pilot, and NASA astronaut. He was a member of the crews of Gemini 4 and Apollo 1.

After graduating from West Point in 1952 with a Bachelor of Science degree, White was sent to flight training, and assigned to the 22nd Fighter Day Squadron at Bitburg Air Base, West Germany, where he flew the F-86 Sabre and F-100 Super Sabre fighters. In 1958, he enrolled in the University of Michigan to study aeronautical engineering, receiving his Master of Science degree in 1959. White then received test pilot training at Edwards Air Force Base, California, before being assigned as a test pilot for the Aeronautical Systems Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

White was selected as one of the second group of astronauts, the so-called &quot;Next Nine&quot;, who were chosen to take part in the Gemini and Apollo missions. He was assigned as pilot of Gemini 4 alongside command pilot James McDivitt. On June 3, 1965, White became the first American to walk in space. He was then assigned as senior pilot of the first crewed Apollo mission, Apollo 1. White died on January 27, 1967, alongside astronauts Virgil &quot;Gus&quot; Grissom and Roger B. Chaffee in a fire during pre-launch testing for Apollo 1 at Cape Canaveral, Florida. He was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal for his flight in Gemini 4 and was then awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor posthumously.

== Early life ==
Edward Higgins White II was born on November 14, 1930, in San Antonio, Texas, the son of Edward Higgins White Sr. (1901–1978), a West Point graduate (Class of 1924) who later rose to become a major general in the United States Air Force (USAF), and Mary Rosina White (; 1900–1983). He had a younger brother, James Blair White (1942–1969), and an older sister, Jeanne. His interest in aviation was sparked at the age of twelve when his father took him for a ride in a North American T-6 Texan trainer. He became a member of the Boy Scouts of America, where he earned the rank of Second Class Scout.

Due to the nature of his father&#x27;s job, White&#x27;s family moved often to different military bases across the country throughout his childhood. The White family moved from San Antonio, Texas to Dayton, Ohio, where he attended Oakwood Junior High School, and to Washington, D.C., where he attended Western High School. After graduating in 1948, he wanted to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps and attend West Point, but his family&#x27;s peripatetic life presented a problem: an appointment to West Point from a United States Congressman was required, and the family had not been continuously resident in any one place for very long. White went down to the Capitol and knocked on Congressmen&#x27;s doors seeking an appointment, armed with a glowing reference from his high school principal. He eventually secured one from Congressman Ross Rizley from Oklahoma.

White entered West Point on July 15, 1948. He acquired the nickname &quot;Red&quot; from the color of his hair. While at West Point, White competed for a spot on the 1952 U.S. Olympic team in the 400 meter hurdles race, but missed qualification in the heat by 0.4 seconds. White was also a half-back on the West Point soccer team. His hobbies included squash, handball, swimming, golf, and photography. His classmates included Michael Collins, who later became an astronaut as well.

===Military service===
Upon graduation with a Bachelor of Science degree from West Point, ranked 128th out of 523 in the Class of 1952, White was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Air Force. Under a 1949 agreement, up to 25percent of the graduating classes of West Point and the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis could volunteer for the Air Force. Between 1950, when the agreement became effective, and 1959, when the first class graduated from the United States Air Force Academy, about 3,200 West Point cadets and Annapolis midshipmen chose to do so. White received his initial pilot training at Bartow Air Base, Florida, and his jet training at James Connally Air Force Base, Texas. After receiving his pilot wings in 1953, White was assigned to Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, for Fighter Gunnery School. In February 1953, White married Patricia Eileen Finegan (1934–1983), whom he had met at a West Point football game. They had two children, Edward Higgins White III (born in 1953) and Bonnie Lynn White (born in 1956).
White was assigned to the 22nd Fighter Squadron at Bitburg Air Base in West Germany, where he spent three and a half years flying North American F-86 Sabre and North American F-100 Super Sabre fighters. Among his colleagues were Buzz Aldrin, who graduated a year ahead of him at West Point, and James Salter. In 1957, White read an article about the astronauts of the future, and decided to become one. He believed that getting an advanced degree would improve his chances of being selected. Aldrin later recalled that White convinced him to follow this path as well. In September 1958, White enrolled in the University of Michigan under Air Force sponsorship to study aeronautical engineering. His classmates included James McDivitt, Jim Irwin and Ted Freeman. White was awarded his Master of Science degree in 1959.

After it became clear that being a test pilot would also improve his chances of being selected to become an astronaut, White attended the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California, with class 59-C, which graduated in July 1959. McDivitt was one of his classmates. White was assigned to the Aeronautical Systems Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. There, he did flight tests for weapons development, and helped make recommendations for aircraft design on aircraft such as the Fairchild C-123 Provider, Convair C-131 Samaritan, Boeing C-135 Stratolifter, the North American F-100 Super Sabre, Convair F-102 Delta Dagger and Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star. As a weightlessness- and extended-flight-training captain, he piloted the planes that were used to train astronauts in weightlessness. His passengers included John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth, and Ham, the first hominid in space. During his career, White would log more than 3,000 flight hours with the Air Force, including about 2,200 hours in jets.

== NASA career ==
=== Gemini program ===
White was one of eleven pilots whose names the Air Force submitted to NASA in 1962 as potential candidates for the second group of astronauts. He was then selected as one of 32 finalists who would undergo medical and psychological examinations at Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio. White arrived at the Aerospace Medical Center at Brooks AFB on July 30, 1962. He ran around the perimeter of Brooks every day during the testing to keep in shape.

White was one of nine men chosen by NASA as part of Astronaut Group 2 in September 1962. Their selection was announced at a press conference in Cullen Auditorium at the University of Houston on September 17, 1962. Like their predecessors, the Mercury Seven, each of the new astronauts was assigned an area of specialization within the crewed space program: in White&#x27;s case, flight control systems.

==== Gemini 4 ====
White was selected to be the pilot of Gemini 4, with McDivitt as his command pilot. The Chief of the Astronaut Office, Mercury Seven astronaut Deke Slayton, paired them because they knew each other well, having attended the University of Michigan and test pilot school together. The mission objectives were ill-defined at first, but consideration was given to performing extravehicular activity (EVA), space rendezvous and orbital station-keeping.

Knowing that EVA (or spacewalk) was a possibility, McDivitt pressed for it to be included in the mission. As a result, NASA management agreed to ensure that the Gemini space suit for the mission was capable of being used for EVA. Kenneth S. Kleinknecht told the July 1964 press conference that announced the mission that one of the crew might open the hatch and stick his head outside, but this attracted little attention. On March 18, 1965, cosmonaut Alexei Leonov became the first man to perform an EVA, on the Voskhod 2 mission, but not until May 25 was EVA approved for Gemini 4 by NASA administrator James E. Webb.

White was a devout Methodist. On the Gemini 4 mission he carried three pieces of religious jewelry to take with him on his EVA: a gold cross, a St. Christopher Medal and a Star of David. White commented: &quot;I felt while I couldn&#x27;t take one for every religion in the country, I could take the items most familiar to me.&quot;

On June 3, 1965, the Gemini 4 crew was launched into space to begin its four-day mission. After separation from the Titan II upper stage, McDivitt attempted to rendezvous with the booster. However, this was unsuccessful since the astronauts were not adequately trained to rendezvous in orbit. The objective had to be abandoned since the allocated propellant had been used up, and the maneuvers had pushed the spacecraft&#x27;s orbit too far away from Earth. The mission also included 11 different scientific experiments, including the use of a sextant for celestial navigation.

After the failed rendezvous attempt, White appeared tired and hot, so the EVA was postponed from the second revolution to the third revolution. At 19:46 UTC, White became the first American to make an EVA. During his spacewalk, White used an oxygen-propelled gun called the Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit to propel himself. White found the experience so exhilarating that he was reluctant to terminate the EVA at the allotted time, and had to be ordered back into the spacecraft.

While White was outside, a spare thermal glove floated away through the open hatch of the spacecraft, becoming an early piece of space debris in low Earth orbit, until it burned up upon re-entry into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. There was a mechanical problem with the hatch mechanism, which made it difficult to open and to relatch. McDivitt was able to get the door locked by using his glove to push on the gears that controlled the mechanism. This added to the time constraint of the spacewalk and could have threatened the lives of both men if McDivitt had been unable to get the hatch latched, as they could not re-enter the atmosphere with an unsealed hatch.
When they returned to Earth, the two astronauts found that they were now celebrities. President Lyndon B. Johnson came to Houston to congratulate them, and he promoted them to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Later that week they traveled to the White House where Johnson presented them the NASA Exceptional Service Medal. They were given a ticker tape parade in Chicago, and went to the 1965 Paris Air Show, where they met cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin.

White&#x27;s next assignment after Gemini 4 was as the backup for Gemini 7 command pilot Frank Borman, with Michael Collins assigned as his pilot. He was also named the astronaut specialist for the flight control systems of the Apollo command module. Under the usual procedure of crew rotation in the Gemini program, White would have been in line for a second flight as the command pilot of Gemini 10 in July 1966, which would have made him the first of his group to fly twice. Instead, he was selected for the Apollo 1 spaceflight.

=== Apollo program ===
In March 1966, White was selected as senior pilot (second seat) for the first crewed Apollo flight, designated AS-204. His fellow astronauts would be Command Pilot Virgil &quot;Gus&quot; Grissom, who had flown in space on the Mercury-Redstone 4 mission in 1961 and as commander of the Gemini 3 in 1965, and Pilot Roger Chaffee, who had yet to fly into space. The mission, which the men named &quot;Apollo 1&quot; in June, was originally planned for late 1966 to coincide with the last Gemini mission, but the impracticality of making the Gemini capsule and systems compatible with Apollo and delays in the spacecraft development pushed the launch into 1967.

The launch of Apollo 1 was planned for February 21, 1967. The crew entered the spacecraft at 13:00 on January 27, mounted atop its Saturn IB booster on Launch Pad 34 at Cape Kennedy, for a &quot;plugs-out&quot; test of the spacecraft. The test was to demonstrate all of the space vehicle systems and procedures, which included an abbreviated countdown and flight simulation. It was not classified as hazardous since the rocket would not be fueled during the test. The test&#x27;s progress was delayed by problems with a cabin odor and poor communications between the ground stations and the crew. At 18:31, a fire broke out in the pure oxygen-filled cabin, killing all three crewmen.

Emergency roles had called for White to actuate the inner hatch release handle; then, Grissom would assist him in the removal of the cover, while Chaffee would maintain communications. White had apparently tried to do his part: his body was found in his center seat, with his arms reaching over his head toward the hatch. Removing the cover to open the hatch was impossible because the plug door design required venting normally slightly greater-than-atmospheric pressure and pulling the cover into the cabin. Grissom was unable to reach the cabin vent control to his left, where the fire&#x27;s source was located. The intense heat raised the cabin pressure even more, to , at which point the cabin walls ruptured. The astronauts were killed by asphyxiation, smoke inhalation, and thermal burns.

=== Aftermath ===

The fire&#x27;s ignition source was determined to be a spark that jumped from a wire on the far left of the spacecraft, under Grissom&#x27;s seat. Their deaths were attributed to a wide range of lethal hazards in the early Apollo Command Module design: workmanship and conditions of the test, including the highly pressurized 100% oxygen pre-launch atmosphere, many wiring and plumbing flaws, flammable materials used in the cockpit and the astronauts&#x27; flight suits, and a hatch which could not be quickly opened in an emergency. After the incident, these problems were fixed, and the Apollo program carried on successfully to reach its objective of landing men on the Moon.

White was buried with full military honors at West Point Cemetery while Grissom and Chaffee are both buried in Arlington National Cemetery. NASA officials attempted to pressure Patricia White, his widow, into allowing her husband also to be buried at Arlington, against what she knew to be his wishes; their efforts were foiled by astronaut Frank Borman. Patricia received $100,000 from the life insurance portion of the contract the astronauts signed to give two publishing firms exclusive rights to the stories and photographs of the astronauts and their families. She also received $16,250 annually for the life of the contract. Patricia later remarried and continued to reside in Houston. On September 6, 1983, she took her own life after surgery earlier in the year to remove a tumor.

White&#x27;s younger brother James resolved to follow in his older brother&#x27;s footsteps. He graduated from the Air Force Academy and became a fighter pilot. He set his sights on becoming a test pilot and then an astronaut. He thought that air combat experience would facilitate this, so he volunteered for service in the Vietnam War. While flying a combat mission on November 24, 1969, with 357th Tactical Fighter Squadron, he was killed when his aircraft crashed. Nearly half a century later his remains were identified, and they were buried adjacent to White&#x27;s in West Point Cemetery on June 19, 2018.

<text>Roger Bruce Chaffee (; February 15, 1935 – January 27, 1967) was an American naval officer, aviator and aeronautical engineer who was a NASA astronaut in the Apollo program.

Chaffee was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he became an Eagle Scout. He graduated from Central High School in 1953, and accepted a Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) scholarship. He began his college education at Illinois Institute of Technology, where he was involved in the fraternity Phi Kappa Sigma. He transferred to Purdue University in 1954, continuing his involvement in Phi Kappa Sigma serving as chapter president in 1956 and obtaining his private pilot&#x27;s license.

After graduating from Purdue in 1957 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering, Chaffee completed his Navy training and was commissioned as an ensign. He began pilot training at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, flying aircraft such as the T-34, T-28, and A3D. He became quality and safety control officer for Heavy Photographic Squadron 62 (VAP-62). His time in this unit included taking crucial photos of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis, earning him the Air Medal. He was promoted to lieutenant commander in 1966.

Along with thirteen other pilots, Chaffee was selected to be an astronaut as part of NASA Astronaut Group 3 in 1963. He served as capsule communicator (CAPCOM) for the Gemini 3 and Gemini 4 missions and received his first spaceflight assignment in 1966 as the third-ranking pilot on Apollo 1. In 1967, he died in a fire along with fellow astronauts Virgil &quot;Gus&quot; Grissom and Ed White during a pre-launch test for the mission at what was then the Cape Kennedy Air Force Station Launch Complex 34, Florida. He was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor and a second Air Medal.

==Early life==
Roger Bruce Chaffee was born on February 15, 1935, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the second child of Donald Lynn Chaffee (1910–1998) and Blanche May (Mike) Chaffee (; 1912–1996). He had an older sister, Donna, born two years earlier. In January 1935, in their hometown of Greenville, Michigan, his father was diagnosed with scarlet fever, so his mother moved in with her parents in Grand Rapids, where Roger was born. The family spent the next seven years in Greenville before moving to Grand Rapids, where his father took a job as the chief Army Ordnance inspector at the Doehler-Jarvis plant. Chaffee&#x27;s interest in aerospace was sparked at a young age when his father, a former barnstorming pilot, took him on his first flight at the age of seven. Chaffee was thrilled by the flight and soon after started building model airplanes with his father.

===Boy Scouts===
Chaffee excelled as a Boy Scout, earning his first merit badge at the age of thirteen. He earned ten more badges that year. Many of these awards were typically earned by the older scouts. He continued his success by earning four more badges at the age of fourteen. He earned four badges for each of the next two years, almost all the badges available at the time. After becoming an Eagle Scout, he managed to earn another ten merit badges, for which he was awarded the bronze and gold palms. Between his camping trips with his family and his involvement with the Boy Scouts, Chaffee developed a passion for the outdoors.

===Education===
Chaffee attended the Dickinson School in Grand Rapids, and later graduated from Central High School in the top 20% of his class in 1953. Turning down a possible appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, he accepted a Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) scholarship, and in September 1953 enrolled at the Illinois Institute of Technology. He performed well, making the Dean&#x27;s List and finishing with a B+ average. While enrolled, he joined Phi Kappa Sigma.

Chaffee was passionate about flying, and had a strong aptitude for science and engineering. To apply those talents, he transferred to Purdue University in the autumn of 1954 to attend the school&#x27;s well-known aeronautical engineering program. Before arriving in West Lafayette, he reported for an 8-week tour on as a part of the NROTC program. To qualify, he had to finish training and pass further tests. He initially failed the eye exam, but the physician permitted him to retake it the next morning, and he passed. He was then allowed to tour on &quot;Wisconsin&quot; to England, Scotland, France, and Cuba. Upon his return to American soil, he worked as a gear cutter.

After starting classes at Purdue, Chaffee sought out a job to complement his coursework and involvement in the Phi Kappa Sigma social fraternity. His first job during his sophomore year was working as a server at one of the women&#x27;s residences, but he disliked the job and sought new employment. He was hired as a draftsman at a small business near Purdue. As a junior, he was hired as a teaching assistant in the Mathematics Department to teach classes to freshman students. He was elected to the Tau Beta Pi national engineering honor society which is equivalent to Phi Beta Kappa in the non-engineering disciplines, and Sigma Gamma Tau engineering honor societies.
In 1955, Chaffee took four flying lessons, but he did not have enough money to get his private pilot&#x27;s license. Two years later, the NROTC sponsored flight training for him to become a naval aviator. He soloed on March 29, 1957, and obtained his private pilot&#x27;s license on May 24, 1957. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree, with distinction, in aeronautical engineering at Purdue in 1957.

===Family===
Chaffee met his future wife Martha Louise Horn on a double-blind date in September 1955. They started dating, and he proposed to her on October 12, 1956. They married in Oklahoma City, Martha&#x27;s hometown, on August 24, 1957. Martha was a homemaker. The couple had two children, Sheryl Lyn (born in 1958) and Stephen (born in 1961).

== Navy service ==

After graduation, Chaffee completed his Navy training on August 22, 1957, and received commission as an ensign. Following his honeymoon, he was assigned to the aircraft carrier for a six-week assignment in Norfolk with the Naval Air Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet. By the time Chaffee arrived at the base, the ship had already left port. He temporarily worked at the base until October 1957, when he attended flight school at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. He started his training by flying the T-28 and the T-34. He was posted to Naval Air Station Kingsville, Texas, from August 1958 to February 1959 as a part of Advanced Training Unit 212. In Kingsville, he trained on the F9F Cougar jet fighter. His daughter Sheryl was born the day before he left for his first aircraft carrier training. He was awarded his naval aviator wings in early 1959.

Chaffee was transferred to Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida, to continue his training. His first project was not flying, but repairing an A3D twin-engine jet photo reconnaissance plane. This plane was typically flown by pilots with the rank of lieutenant commander or above, but Chaffee became so familiar with the plane from repairing it he became one of the youngest pilots ever to fly it. He joined Attack Squadron 44 (VA-44) in September 1959, and from October 1959 to March 1960 he trained with Heavy Attack Squadron 3 (VAH-3).
Chaffee received a variety of assignments and participated in multiple training duties over the next several years, spending most of his time in photo reconnaissance squadrons. He was stationed at NAS Jacksonville as safety officer and quality control officer for Heavy Photographic Squadron 62 (VAP-62) flying the A3D. He wrote a quality control manual for the squadron, although some of his peers saw this as too demanding. By coincidence, he was assigned to a mission where he flew over Cape Canaveral, during which aerial photographs of future launch sites were taken.

Between April 4, 1960, and October 25, 1962, including during the critical time of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Chaffee flew 82 missions over Cuba, sometimes up to three per day, and achieved over 100 flight hours each month. Some of these trips included shuttling three men per plane back and forth to Guantanamo Bay, including the pilot, co-pilot, and the photographer. Some biographies credit him with flying the U-2 plane to spy on Cuba, but this is erroneous since he was a Navy pilot and the U-2 was an Air Force plane.

After this, Chaffee undertook aircraft carrier flight training, including time spent on performing both day and night flights. He said of day flying, &quot;Setting that big bird down on the flight deck was like landing on a postage stamp&quot;; and of night flying, &quot;Getting catapulted off that flight deck at night is like getting shot into a bottle of ink!&quot; While working in Jacksonville, he concurrently worked on a master&#x27;s degree. He was on a cruise to Africa when his son Stephen was born in Oklahoma City.

During Chaffee&#x27;s Navy service he logged more than 2,300 hours flying time, including more than 2,000 hours in jet aircraft. On February 1, 1966, he was promoted to lieutenant commander.

== NASA career ==

=== Selection ===

In August 1962, Chaffee confided in his family that he had submitted an application for the NASA astronaut training program, and informed his superiors of his desire to train as a test pilot for astronaut status. In mid-1962, he was accepted in the initial pool of 1,800 applicants for the third group of NASA astronauts. After his naval tour was over, and he had racked up over 1,800 hours of flying time, the Navy offered him the opportunity to continue work on his master&#x27;s degree. In January 1963, he entered the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, of Air University, to work on his Master of Science degree in reliability engineering.

While at AFIT, Chaffee continued participating in astronaut candidate testing as the pool of candidates dropped to 271 in mid-1963. It was noted during testing that he had a very small lung capacity but he used it better than most people with greater capacity. On his return from a hunting trip to Fairborn, Ohio, on October 14, 1963, he found a message from NASA in Houston, Texas. He called them back, and discovered he had been chosen as an astronaut. On October 18, 1963, it was officially announced that he was one of fourteen chosen for NASA&#x27;s third group of astronauts. He said, &quot;I was very pleased with the appointment. I&#x27;ve always wanted to fly and perform adventurous flying tasks all my life. Ever since the first seven Mercury astronauts were named, I&#x27;ve been keeping my studies up.&quot;

=== Training ===

Phase one of training for the third group of astronauts began in 1964 in lecture halls. Lectures in several fields were supplemented with trips to locations with geological significance so the astronauts gained hands-on experience. As well as piloting the spacecraft, the astronauts were to perform scientific experiments and measurements on the Moon. The astronauts traveled to the Grand Canyon to learn about geography and to Alaska, Iceland, and Hawaii to learn about rock formations and lava flows.

The second phase was contingency training, which focused on astronauts learning the skills required to survive if the landing did not occur where planned. The group started their training by being dropped off in the middle of the jungle in Panama. They performed the survival training in pairs, carrying only their parachutes and survival kits. Chaffee, with help from his Boy Scout training, foraged for enough food to survive during the three-day training mission. Following the jungle training, the astronauts traveled to an entirely different environment: the desert of Reno, Nevada. For clothing, the astronauts had only long underwear, shoes, and robes they manufactured from their parachutes. Lizards and snakes were the main source of food, and the astronauts used their parachutes as makeshift tents for shelter for the two days of desert training.

The third and final phase was operational training for the astronauts. This focused on giving them hands-on experience using the instruments and equipment required during their spaceflight. They received training in the effects of microgravity and rapid acceleration. The astronauts spent time in simulators, aboard cargo planes that simulated weightlessness, underwater to practice extravehicular activities (EVAs), and on visits to manufacturing plants to check on the progress of the hardware.

=== Project Gemini ===

Every astronaut was required to have a specialty, and Chaffee&#x27;s specialty was communications. He focused on the Deep Space Instrumentation Facility (DSIF), which the astronauts needed for navigation in space.

At the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, Chaffee served as capsule communicator (CAPCOM) in March 1965 for Gemini 3. Later that year, he was CAPCOM, along with Virgil &quot;Gus&quot; Grissom and Eugene Cernan, for the Gemini 4 mission, in which Ed White performed the first spacewalk by an American. As CAPCOM, Chaffee relayed information between the crew members and the Director of Flight Operations, Chris Kraft. He never got a seat on a Gemini mission, but was assigned to work on flight control, communications, instrumentation, and attitude and translation control systems in the Apollo program. During this time, along with Grissom, he also flew chase planes at an altitude of between to take motion pictures of the launch of an uncrewed Saturn 1B rocket.

=== Apollo program ===

Chaffee received his first spaceflight assignment in January 1966, when he was selected for the first crewed Apollo-Saturn flight, AS-204. At the time, he was the youngest American astronaut to be selected for a mission. Joining Command Pilot Grissom and Senior Pilot White, he replaced the injured Donn F. Eisele in the third-ranked pilot position. Eisele required surgery for a dislocated shoulder, which he sustained aboard the KC-135 weightlessness training aircraft. He was reassigned to a second Apollo crew, commanded by Wally Schirra.

The crew announcement was made public on March 21, 1966. The two-week flight of Apollo1 was to test the spacecraft systems and the control and ground tracking facilities. While Chaffee had monitored the manufacture of the Gemini spacecraft, he had not witnessed the building of the Apollo spacecraft. Three days after being selected for the Apollo1 crew, he flew to the North American Aviation Plant in Downey, California, to see it.

Later in April, the crew traveled to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, to study stars that were programmed into their flight computer. In October, the six crewmembers planned to test the spacecraft in sea level and altitude conditions. The failure of an oxygen regulator prevented them from performing the vacuum test, but they managed to complete the sea level test. They also performed egress tests, where capsule simulators were dropped in the Gulf of Mexico under various conditions and the crew had to exit the spacecraft. The crew was able to spend time with their families at Christmas. Chaffee entered a local Christmas decoration contest and he received first prize. Four Purdue astronauts were requested to attend the Rose Bowl as guests of honor; Grissom, Gene Cernan, Neil Armstrong, and Chaffee attended the game on January 2, 1967. Progress on pre-mission activities was nearing completion; NASA announced on Monday, January 23, that February 21 was the target launch date. The primary and backup crews moved back to the Cape for the last few weeks of training. They had their own living quarters, a private waiter and chef, and gymnasium to remain fit.
On Friday, January 27, Grissom, White, and Chaffee were participating in a &quot;plugs-out&quot; countdown demonstration test at Cape Kennedy in preparation for the planned February 21 launch. Chaffee was sitting at the right side of the cabin. His main role was to maintain communications with the blockhouse. A momentary power surge was detected at 23:30:55 GMT (6:30 pm EST), which was believed to accompany an electrical short in equipment located on the lower left side of the cabin, the presumed ignition source for the fire. At 23:31:04 GMT, a voice was heard declaring, &quot;[We]&#x27;ve got a fire in the cockpit.&quot; Most investigative listeners believe that voice was Chaffee&#x27;s.

Assigned emergency roles called for Grissom, in the left-hand seat, to open the cabin pressure vent valve, after which White in the center seat was to open the plug door hatch, while Chaffee in the right-hand seat was to maintain communications. Grissom was prevented from opening the valve by the intensity of the fire, which started in that region and spread from left to right. Despite this, White removed his restraints and apparently tried in vain to open the hatch, which was held closed by the cabin pressure. The increasing pressure finally burst the inner cabin wall on the right-hand side at 23:31:19 GMT. After approximately thirty seconds of being fed by a cabin atmosphere of pure oxygen at pressures of , and now fed by nitrogen-buffered ambient air, the primary fire decreased in intensity and started producing large amounts of smoke, which killed the astronauts. Chaffee lost consciousness because of a lack of oxygen which sent him into cardiac arrest. He died from asphyxia due to the toxic gases from the fire, with burns contributing to his death.

Failed oxygen and ethylene glycol pipes near the fire&#x27;s origin point continued burning an intense secondary fire which melted through the cabin floor. By the time firefighters were able to open the hatch, the fire had extinguished itself. The back of Chaffee&#x27;s couch was found in the horizontal position, with the lower portion angled towards the floor. His helmet was closed and locked, his restraints were undone, and the hoses and electrical connections to the suit remained connected. As he was farthest from the origin of the fire, he suffered the least burn and suit damage.

=== Aftermath ===
Shortly after the AS-204 fire in 1967, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Spaceflight George Mueller announced the mission would be officially designated as Apollo 1. The capsule underwent a significant redesign as a result of the disaster. The atmosphere in the cabin was changed from 100% oxygen to a 60% oxygen and 40% nitrogen environment at launch. The astronauts&#x27; spacesuits, originally made of nylon, were changed to beta cloth, a non-flammable, highly melt-resistant fabric woven from fiberglass and coated with Teflon. There were other changes, including replacing flammable cabin materials with self-extinguishing ones, and covering plumbing and wiring with protective insulation.

Chaffee and Grissom were buried in Arlington National Cemetery, while White was buried at West Point Cemetery. Chaffee&#x27;s widow received $100,000 from the life insurance portion of the contract the astronauts signed with two publishing firms so they would have exclusive rights to stories and photographs of the astronauts and their families. She also received $16,250 per year for the life of the contract.

== Memorials ==

Chaffee is memorialized in many ways, from the Chaffee Crater on the far side of the Moon, to the Roger B. Chaffee Planetarium in his hometown of Grand Rapids, Michigan. When the Kent County International Airport relocated farther out in suburban Grand Rapids in 1963, the main runway of the original airport was repurposed into a major roadway and named Roger B. Chaffee Boulevard. Another memorial is a hill on Mars, Chaffee Hill, south-southwest of Columbia Memorial Station, part of the Apollo 1 Hills. &quot;Regor&quot; (&quot;Roger&quot; spelled backwards), is a seldom-used nickname for the star Gamma Velorum. Grissom used this name, plus two others for White and himself, on his Apollo1 mission planning star charts as a joke, and the succeeding Apollo astronauts kept using the names as a memorial. A terrestrial memorial is Chaffee Island, an artificial island off Long Beach, California, created in 1966 for drilling oil (along with White, Grissom and Freeman Islands). A park in Fullerton, California, was named after Chaffee; parks were also named after his fellow Apollo1 comrades. Chaffee is named with his Apollo1 crewmates on the Space Mirror Memorial, which was dedicated in 1991. Chaffee&#x27;s name is included on the plaque left on the Moon with the &quot;Fallen Astronaut&quot; statue in 1971 by the crew of Apollo 15.

The dismantled Launch Pad 34 at Cape Canaveral bears two memorial plaques:

The Roger B. Chaffee scholarship named for him has been awarded annually since 1967 to exceptional students in the Kent Intermediate School District for high school seniors who will be pursuing a career in math and science. Chaffee Hall, an engineering building, was dedicated to him at his alma mater, Purdue University, in 1968. Grissom High School, Ed White Middle School and Chaffee Elementary School in Huntsville, Alabama, were named for the Apollo1 astronauts.

Roger That! is an annual event sponsored by the Grand Rapids Public Museum and Grand Valley State University that celebrates space exploration and the life of Chaffee, who was a Grand Rapids native.

== Awards and honors ==

Chaffee was awarded the Navy Air Medal for his involvement in Heavy Photographic Squadron 62. He completed 82 classified missions &quot;of paramount military importance to the security of the United States&quot;. The Apollo1 crew was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal posthumously in a 1969 presentation of the Presidential Medal of Freedom to the Apollo 11 crew. He was posthumously awarded a second Air Medal. He was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1983 and into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame, on October 4, 1997. Chaffee and White were awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor posthumously in 1997 (Grissom received the medal in 1978). He was later awarded the NASA Ambassador of Exploration Award for involvement in the U.S. space program in 2007.

On the television show &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; a fictional 24th century spacecraft was named after him, designed by Doug Drexler. They named it after Chaffee as a reminder about the dangers of space exploration. &quot;Star Trek&quot; and NASA have a long history of collaborations going back to the late 1960s when the television show made its debut.

In 2018 a life-size bronze statue of Chaffee was unveiled outside the Grand Rapids Children&#x27;s Museum in Chaffee&#x27;s hometown. His wife, other family members, and astronaut Jack Lousma (a Grand Rapids native) were present for the event.

<text>Loire (; ; ; or &quot;Leir&quot;) is a landlocked département in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region of France occupying the river Loire&#x27;s upper reaches. Its prefecture is Saint-Étienne. It had a population of 765,634 in 2019.

== History ==

Loire was created in 1793 when the Rhône-et-Loire département was split into two, about three years after it was created in 1790. This was a response to counter-revolutionary activities in Lyon which, by population, was the country&#x27;s second largest city. By splitting Rhône-et-Loire the government sought to protect the French Revolution from the potential power and influence of counter revolutionary activity in the Lyon region.

The Loire département roughly corresponds to the former province of Forez.

The departmental capitals (prefectures) throughout its history are as follows:
* Feurs 1793–1795
* Montbrison 1795–1855
* Saint-Étienne since 1855

== Geography ==

Loire is part of the current administrative region of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes and is surrounded by the départements of Rhône, Isère, Ardèche, Haute-Loire, Puy-de-Dôme, Allier, and Saône-et-Loire.

The river Loire traverses the department from south to north.

The Loire département is divided into three arrondissements:
* Arrondissement of Montbrison
* Arrondissement of Roanne
* Arrondissement of Saint-Étienne

Parts of the department belong to Parc naturel régional Livradois-Forez.

==Demographics==
The inhabitants of the département are called &quot;Ligériens&quot;. The industrial city of Saint-Étienne with its agglomeration contains about half of the inhabitants of the département.

Population development since 1801:

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Saint-Étienne, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 6 communes with more than 15,000 inhabitants:

==Politics==

The president of the Departmental Council is Georges Ziegler, elected in October 2017.

===Current National Assembly Representatives===

<text>A rotaxane () is a mechanically interlocked molecular architecture consisting of a dumbbell-shaped molecule which is threaded through a macrocycle (see graphical representation). The two components of a rotaxane are kinetically trapped since the ends of the dumbbell (often called &quot;stoppers&quot;) are larger than the internal diameter of the ring and prevent dissociation (unthreading) of the components since this would require significant distortion of the covalent bonds.

Much of the research concerning rotaxanes and other mechanically interlocked molecular architectures, such as catenanes, has been focused on their efficient synthesis or their utilization as artificial molecular machines. However, examples of rotaxane substructure have been found in naturally occurring peptides, including: cystine knot peptides, cyclotides or lasso-peptides such as microcin J25.

== Synthesis ==
The earliest reported synthesis of a rotaxane in 1967 relied on the statistical probability that if two halves of a dumbbell-shaped molecule were reacted in the presence of a macrocycle that some small percentage would connect through the ring. To obtain a reasonable quantity of rotaxane, the macrocycle was attached to a solid-phase support and treated with both halves of the dumbbell 70 times and then severed from the support to give a 6% yield. However, the synthesis of rotaxanes has advanced significantly and efficient yields can be obtained by preorganizing the components utilizing hydrogen bonding, metal coordination, hydrophobic forces, covalent bonds, or coulombic interactions. The three most common strategies to synthesize rotaxane are &quot;capping&quot;, &quot;clipping&quot;, and &quot;slipping&quot;, though others do exist. Recently, Leigh and co-workers described a new pathway to mechanically interlocked architectures involving a transition-metal center that can catalyse a reaction through the cavity of a macrocycle.

===Capping===

Synthesis via the capping method relies strongly upon a thermodynamically driven template effect; that is, the &quot;thread&quot; is held within the &quot;macrocycle&quot; by non-covalent interactions, for example rotaxinations with cyclodextrin macrocycles involve exploitation of the hydrophobic effect. This dynamic complex or pseudorotaxane is then converted to the rotaxane by reacting the ends of the threaded guest with large groups, preventing disassociation.

===Clipping===
The clipping method is similar to the capping reaction except that in this case the dumbbell shaped molecule is complete and is bound to a partial macrocycle. The partial macrocycle then undergoes a ring closing reaction around the dumbbell-shaped molecule, forming the rotaxane.

===Slipping===
The method of slipping is one which exploits the thermodynamic stability of the rotaxane. If the end groups of the dumbbell are an appropriate size it will be able to reversibly thread through the macrocycle at higher temperatures. By cooling the dynamic complex, it becomes kinetically trapped as a rotaxane at the lower temperature.

=== Snapping ===
Snapping involves two separate parts of the thread, both containing a bulky group. one part of the thread is then threaded to the macrocycle, forming a semi rotaxane, and end is closed of by the other part of the thread forming the rotaxane.

===&quot;Active template&quot; methodology===
Leigh and co-workers recently began to explore a strategy in which template ions could also play an active role in promoting the crucial final covalent bond forming reaction that captures the interlocked structure (i.e., the metal has a dual function, acting as a template for entwining the precursors and catalyzing covalent bond formation between the reactants).

== Potential applications ==
===Molecular machines===

Rotaxane-based molecular machines have been of initial interest for their potential use in molecular electronics as logic molecular switching elements and as molecular shuttles. These molecular machines are usually based on the movement of the macrocycle on the dumbbell. The macrocycle can rotate around the axis of the dumbbell like a wheel and axle or it can slide along its axis from one site to another. Controlling the position of the macrocycle allows the rotaxane to function as a molecular switch, with each possible location of the macrocycle corresponding to a different state. These rotaxane machines can be manipulated both by chemical and photochemical inputs. Rotaxane based systems have also been shown to function as molecular muscles. In 2009, there was a report of a &quot;domino effect&quot; from one extremity to the other in a Glycorotaxane Molecular Machine. In this case, the 4&quot;C&quot;1 or 1&quot;C&quot;4 chair-like conformation of the mannopyranoside stopper can be controlled, depending on the localization of the macrocycle. In 2012, unique pseudo-macrocycles consisting of double-lasso molecular machines (also called rotamacrocycles) were reported in Chem. Sci. These structures can be tightened or loosened depending on pH. A controllable jump rope movement was also observed in these new molecular machines.

=== Ultrastable dyes ===
Potential application as long-lasting dyes is based on the enhanced stability of the inner portion of the dumbbell-shaped molecule. Studies with cyclodextrin-protected rotaxane azo dyes established this characteristic. More reactive squaraine dyes have also been shown to have enhanced stability by preventing nucleophilic attack of the inner squaraine moiety. The enhanced stability of rotaxane dyes is attributed to the insulating effect of the macrocycle, which is able to block interactions with other molecules.

=== Nanorecording ===
In a nanorecording application, a certain rotaxane is deposited as a Langmuir–Blodgett film on ITO-coated glass. When a positive voltage is applied with the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope probe, the rotaxane rings in the tip area switch to a different part of the dumbbell and the resulting new conformation makes the molecules stick out 0.3 nanometer from the surface. This height difference is sufficient for a memory dot. It is not yet known how to erase such a nanorecording film.

== Nomenclature ==
Accepted nomenclature is to designate the number of components of the rotaxane in brackets as a prefix. Therefore, the a rotaxane consisting of a single dumbbell-shaped axial molecule with a single macrocycle around its shaft is called a [2]rotaxane, and two cyanostar molecules around the central phosphate group of dialkylphosphate is a [3]rotaxane.

<text>Molecular electronics is the study and application of molecular building blocks for the fabrication of electronic components. It is an interdisciplinary area that spans physics, chemistry, and materials science. It provides a potential means to extend Moore&#x27;s Law beyond the foreseen limits of small-scale conventional silicon integrated circuits.

==Molecular scale electronics==

Molecular scale electronics, also called single-molecule electronics, is a branch of nanotechnology that uses single molecules, or nanoscale collections of single molecules, as electronic components. Because single molecules constitute the smallest stable structures possible, this miniaturization is the ultimate goal for shrinking electrical circuits.

Conventional electronic devices are traditionally made from bulk materials. Bulk methods have inherent limits, and are growing increasingly demanding and costly. Thus, the idea was born that the components could instead be built up atom by atom in a chemistry lab (bottom up) as opposed to carving them out of bulk material (top down). In single-molecule electronics, the bulk material is replaced by single molecules. The molecules used have properties that resemble traditional electronic components such as a wire, transistor, or rectifier.

Single-molecule electronics is an emerging field, and entire electronic circuits consisting exclusively of molecular sized compounds are still very far from being realized. However, the continuous demand for more computing power, together with the inherent limits of the present day lithographic methods make the transition seem unavoidable. Currently, the focus is on discovering molecules with interesting properties and on finding ways to obtain reliable and reproducible contacts between the molecular components and the bulk material of the electrodes.

Molecular electronics operates at distances less than 100 nanometers. Miniaturization down to single molecules brings the scale down to a regime where quantum mechanics effects are important. In contrast to the case in conventional electronic components, where electrons can be filled in or drawn out more or less like a continuous flow of electric charge, the transfer of a single electron alters the system significantly. The significant amount of energy due to charging has to be taken into account when making calculations about the electronic properties of the setup and is highly sensitive to distances to conducting surfaces nearby.

One of the biggest problems with measuring on single molecules is to establish reproducible electrical contact with only one molecule and doing so without shortcutting the electrodes. Because the current photolithographic technology is unable to produce electrode gaps small enough to contact both ends of the molecules tested (in the order of nanometers), alternative strategies are used. These include molecular-sized gaps called break junctions, in which a thin electrode is stretched until it breaks. One of the ways to overcome the gap size issue is by trapping molecular functionalized nanoparticles (internanoparticle spacing is matchable to the size of molecules), and later target the molecule by place exchange reaction.

Another method is to use the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to contact molecules adhered at the other end to a metal substrate. Another popular way to anchor molecules to the electrodes is to make use of sulfur&#x27;s high chemical affinity to gold; though useful, the anchoring is non-specific and thus anchors the molecules randomly to all gold surfaces, and the contact resistance is highly dependent on the precise atomic geometry around the site of anchoring and thereby inherently compromises the reproducibility of the connection. To circumvent the latter issue, experiments have shown that fullerenes could be a good candidate for use instead of sulfur because of the large conjugated π-system that can electrically contact many more atoms at once than a single atom of sulfur.

The shift from metal electrodes to semiconductor electrodes allows for more tailored properties and thus for more interesting applications. There are some concepts for contacting organic molecules using semiconductor-only electrodes, for example by using indium arsenide nanowires with an embedded segment of the wider bandgap material indium phosphide used as an electronic barrier to be bridged by molecules.

One of the biggest hindrances for single-molecule electronics to be commercially exploited is the lack of means to connect a molecular sized circuit to bulk electrodes in a way that gives reproducible results. Also problematic is that some measurements on single molecules are done at cryogenic temperatures, near absolute zero, which is very energy consuming.

==History==

The first time in history molecular electronics are mentioned was in 1956 by the German physicist Arthur Von Hippel, who suggested a bottom-up procedure of developing electronics from atoms and molecules rather than using prefabricated materials, an idea he named molecular engineering. However the first breakthrough in the field is considered by many the article by Aviram and Ratner in 1974. In this article named Molecular Rectifiers, they presented a theoretical calculation of transport through a modified charge-transfer molecule with donor acceptor groups that would allow transport only in one direction, essentially like a semiconductor diode. This was a breakthrough that inspired many years of research in the field of molecular electronics.

==Molecular materials for electronics==


The biggest advantage of conductive polymers is their processability, mainly by dispersion. Conductive polymers are not plastics, i.e., they are not thermoformable, yet they are organic polymers, like (insulating) polymers. They can offer high electrical conductivity but have different mechanical properties than other commercially used polymers. The electrical properties can be fine-tuned using the methods of organic synthesis and of advanced dispersion.

The linear-backbone polymers such as polyacetylene, polypyrrole, and polyaniline are the main classes of conductive polymers. Poly(3-alkylthiophenes) are the archetypical materials for solar cells and transistors.

Conducting polymers have backbones of contiguous sp2 hybridized carbon centers. One valence electron on each center resides in a pz orbital, which is orthogonal to the other three sigma-bonds. The electrons in these delocalized orbitals have high mobility when the material is &quot;doped&quot; by oxidation, which removes some of these delocalized electrons. Thus the conjugated p-orbitals form a one-dimensional electronic band, and the electrons within this band become mobile when it is emptied partly. Despite intensive research, the relationship between morphology, chain structure, and conductivity is poorly understood yet.

Due to their poor processability, conductive polymers have few large-scale applications. They have some promise in antistatic materials and have been built into commercial displays and batteries, but have had limits due to the production costs, material inconsistencies, toxicity, poor solubility in solvents, and inability to directly melt process. Nevertheless, conducting polymers are rapidly gaining attraction in new uses with increasingly processable materials with better electrical and physical properties and lower costs. With the availability of stable and reproducible dispersions, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and polyaniline have gained some large-scale applications. While PEDOT is mainly used in antistatic applications and as a transparent conductive layer in the form of PEDOT and polystyrene sulfonic acid (PSS, mixed form: PEDOT:PSS) dispersions, polyaniline is widely used to make printed circuit boards, in the final finish, to protect copper from corrosion and preventing its solderability. Newer nanostructured forms of conducting polymers provide fresh impetus to this field, with their higher surface area and better dispersability.

Recently supramolecular chemistry has been introduced to the field, which provide new opportunity for developing next generation of molecular electronics. For example, two orders of magnitude current intensity enhancement was achieved by inserting cationic molecules into the cavity of pillar[5]arene.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== First Crusade ====
* Spring – The Crusaders under Godfrey of Bouillon attack the Byzantine imperial palace at Blachernae. Norman forces led by Bohemond I join the Crusaders – he is not welcome in Constantinople because his father, Robert Guiscard, has invaded Illyria (territory belonging to the Byzantine Empire), and captured the cities of Dyrrhachium and Corfu (see 1084).
* May 14 – Siege of Nicaea: The Crusaders begin their campaign with the siege of Nicaea (the capital of the Sultanate of Rum), assigning their forces to different sections of the walls, which are well-defended with 200 towers. Towards the end, an advance party of the Seljuk Turks is defeated by troops of Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse (&quot;Saint-Gilles&quot;) and Robert II. 
* June 19 – The Seljuk Turks surrender Nicaea to the Crusaders after a month siege. The Byzantines occupy the city; their commander Manuel Boutoumites is named by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos as &quot;doux&quot; of Nicaea. In the consternation the Crusaders are not allowed to plunder the city and are forced (again) to pledge their allegiance to Alexios.
* July 1 – Battle of Dorylaeum: The Crusaders defeat a Seljuk army led by Kilij Arslan I, ruler of the Sultanate of Rum, who wants revenge for the capture of Nicaea. During the battle many Crusaders are killed but the Seljuk Turks are forced to flee and abandon their tents and treasure after being surprised by the arrival of a second Crusader army.
* October 21 – Siege of Antioch: The Crusaders arrive outside the city and begin the siege. They can not impose a complete blockade on Antioch. The Seljuk garrison comes out of the city to harass Crusader siege-lines and intercept supply convoys (supported by a Genoese fleet of 12 galleys) from Saint Symeon and Alexandretta (modern Turkey).
* December 31 – Battle of Harenc: The Crusaders under the command of Bohemond I and Robert II defeat Seljuk forces from Aleppo, which try to relieve besieged Antioch.

==== Europe ====
* April/May – Battle of Gvozd Mountain: In an attempt to win the crown of the Kingdom of Croatia, the Hungarian army crosses the Drava River and invades Croatia. King Peter II of Croatia moves his residency at Knin Castle to defend his kingdom. The two armies meet each other near Gvozd Mountain (modern-day Mala Kapela). After a fierce battle Peter, the last Croatian king, is defeated and killed by the Hungarians.
* Summer – Almoravid forces launch a new campaign in Al-Andalus (modern Spain). Sultan Yusuf ibn Tashfin, leader of the Almoravid Empire, is honored with the title of &quot;Amir al Muslimin&quot; (&quot;Commander of the Muslims&quot;).
* August 15 – Battle of Consuegra: The Castilian and Leonese army (30,000 men) of King Alfonso VI (&#x27;&quot;the Brave&quot;) is defeated by Almoravid forces (10,000 men) near the Castle of Consuegra.

==== Scotland====
* King Donald III of Scotland (&quot;the Fair&quot;) is deposed by his nephew Edgar (who is supported by King William II of England) after a 4-year reign. Edgar (nicknamed &quot;Probus&quot;, &quot;the Valliant&quot;) becomes ruler of Scotland until 1107.

==== England====
* William II orders the construction of Westminster Hall near Westminster Abbey in London. The hall is designed to hold banquets, ceremonies and coronations that take place in the Abbey nearby.

<doc id="36611" wikidata="Q29606" url="?curid=36611" title="The Stone Roses">
<text>The Stone Roses were an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1983. They were one of the pioneering groups of the Madchester movement in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The band&#x27;s classic and most prominent lineup consisted of vocalist Ian Brown, guitarist John Squire, bassist Mani, and drummer Reni.

The Stone Roses released their eponymous debut album in 1989. The album was a breakthrough success for the band, receiving widespread critical acclaim, and is regarded by many as one of the greatest British albums ever recorded. Following this success, the band sought to capitalize on their newfound fame by signing with a major label. However, their record label at the time, Silvertone, would not let them out of their contract, leading to a lengthy legal battle that culminated with the band signing with Geffen Records in 1991.

The Stone Roses released their second album, &quot;Second Coming&quot;, in 1994, which received mixed reviews. The group soon disbanded after several lineup changes throughout the supporting tour, which began with Reni departing in early 1995, followed by Squire in April 1996. Brown and Mani dissolved the remains of the group in October 1996 following their appearance at the Reading Festival.

Following much media speculation, the Stone Roses announced their reunion on 18 October 2011 and embarked on a world tour in 2012, including three homecoming shows in Heaton Park, Manchester. Plans to record a third album were also floated, but only two singles were released. In June 2012, Chris Coghill, the writer of the film &quot;Spike Island&quot;, revealed that the band &quot;have at least three or four new tracks recorded&quot;. In June 2013, a documentary about the band&#x27;s reformation, directed by Shane Meadows and titled &quot;The Stone Roses: Made of Stone&quot;, was released.

In 2016, the Stone Roses released their first new material in two decades. The band continued to tour until June 2017, at which point cryptic remarks by Brown indicated that the band had split again. This was later confirmed in a 2019 interview with Squire.

==History==
===Formation (1983–1984)===
Ian Brown (initially the bassist) and guitarist John Squire, who knew each other from Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, formed a short-lived Clash-inspired band, The Patrol, in 1980 along with singer/guitarist Andy Couzens and drummer Simon Wolstencroft. They played several gigs in 1980 and recorded a demo tape, but towards the end of that year, they decided on a change of direction. During their last Patrol show, Brown had a taste of being a frontman, singing Sweet&#x27;s &quot;Block Buster!&quot; to close the set. Pete Garner, a friend and roadie, stood in on bass while Couzens wanted to focus on guitar.

In 1981, the band members lost enthusiasm. Brown sold his bass guitar to buy a scooter, and Wolstencroft joined Johnny Marr and Andy Rourke&#x27;s pre-The Smiths band Freak Party. Squire continued to practice guitar while working as an animator for Cosgrove Hall during the day, while Brown ran a Northern soul night in a Salford club. 

Squire and Couzens started a new band, the Fireside Chaps, with bassist Gary &quot;Mani&quot; Mounfield, later recruiting a singer named David &quot;Kaiser&quot; Carty and drummer Chris Goodwin. They changed their name to the Waterfront (after the film &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;), their sound influenced by 1960s groups and contemporary bands such as Orange Juice. Goodwin left before the band recorded their first demo and, shortly after it, Squire asked Brown to join as singer. A meeting with Geno Washington at a party at Brown&#x27;s flat in Hulme, in which Washington told Brown that he would be a star and should be a singer, convinced Brown to take Squire up on his offer. Brown joined the Waterfront in late 1983, for a time sharing vocals with Kaiser (Dave Carty).

Like the earlier attempts at bands, the Waterfront fizzled out. In late 1983, Couzens decided to try again by starting a band and approached Brown. They decided on Wolstencroft (who had turned down the job of drummer in The Smiths) as drummer and Pete Garner as bassist (despite his admission that he could not play anything but &quot;Block Buster!&quot;). They also decided that they needed Squire in the band, and when he agreed the band&#x27;s lineup was cemented. Leaving their previous bands behind, they worked solely on new material. Brown&#x27;s vocal limitations prompted him to take singing lessons for three weeks. After rehearsing for some time without a band name, Squire came up with &quot;The Stone Roses&quot;. Several stories later emerged suggesting that the band had initially been called &quot;English Rose&quot; or that the name was somehow linked to The Rolling Stones. These stories were untrue, Brown explaining: &quot;No, I don&#x27;t know where that English Rose story came from. John thought up the name &#x27;Stone Roses&#x27; - something with a contrast, two words that went against each other&quot;. The band rehearsed for six months, during which time Wolstencroft had been auditioning for other bands, and he left to join Terry Hall&#x27;s band The Colourfield. They got Goodwin to rejoin, but he lasted for only one rehearsal, so they advertised for a replacement and began auditioning, eventually recruiting Alan &quot;Reni&quot; Wren in May 1984.

After rehearsing and writing songs over the summer, they recorded their first demo in late August, making 100 cassettes with artwork by Squire, and set about trying to get gigs. They played their first gig as the Stone Roses on 23 October 1984, supporting Pete Townshend at an anti-heroin concert at the Moonlight Club in London. Brown had sent a demo with an accompanying letter: &quot;I&#x27;m surrounded by skagheads, I wanna smash &#x27;em. Can you give us a show?&quot;. The show was seen by journalists including &quot;Sounds&quot;″ Garry Johnson, who arranged to interview the band a few weeks later. The band received management offers and more gigs soon followed.

Howard (Ginger) Jones, who had recently left his job as director and general manager of the Haçienda, producer Martin Hannett and Tim Chambers agreed to work with the band on an album, setting up Thin Line Records to release it. Jones took on management of the band, although they had already made a similar agreement with Caroline Reed in London. The band got their first positive press in late December, with Johnson tipping them for success in 1985 in Sounds Magazine. A feature on the band followed in January.

=== Early Tour and Releases (1985–1988) ===
The band played their first headlining gig on 4 January 1985, supported by Last Party, after original headliners Mercenary Skank had pulled out. They had their first recording session with Martin Hannett in January 1985 at Strawberry Studios in Stockport, aiming to record tracks for a debut single and an album. Further sessions followed in March, during which they recorded their debut single, the double A-side &quot;So Young&quot;/&quot;Tell Me&quot;. The band were invited to play a live session on Piccadilly Radio in March, premiering a new song, &quot;I Wanna Be Adored&quot;. Tony Michaelides (aka Tony the Greek) from the station arranged for five local bands to play at Dingwalls in London on 8 February: Glee Company, Communal Drop, Fictitious Names, Laugh, and the Stone Roses. Mark Radcliffe, another Piccadilly DJ, was compère for the night. By this time, the Stone Roses had started to build a sizeable following in Manchester. Their first gig in the North of England, at Clouds in Preston, attracted a large audience and descended into a riot after technical problems and friction between the bands on the bill.

The Roses embarked on a tour of Sweden in April, with their first gig in Manchester following their return, at International 1, a venue run by future Stone Roses managers Matthew Cummins and Gareth Evans. A performance at a warehouse party on 20 July helped to build interest in the band, and in August they returned to the studio to record their debut album. Unhappy with the results and with the band&#x27;s sound changing, it was shelved (later released as &quot;Garage Flower&quot;). The &quot;So Young&quot;/&quot;Tell Me&quot; single, however, was released on Thin Line Records in September.

Frustrated with the lack of attention they were getting locally, the band engaged in a graffiti campaign, with Ian Brown and Reni spraying the band&#x27;s name on walls from West Didsbury to the city centre. This brought them negative publicity but added to their increasing notoriety. In 1986, they began working on new material, including &quot;Sally Cinnamon&quot;, and the planned follow-up singles to &quot;So Young&quot; (&quot;I Wanna Be Adored&quot; and &quot;This Is the One&quot;) were shelved. They parted company with Howard Jones and took on Gareth Evans as manager, using Evans&#x27; International 1 venue as their new rehearsal space. Around this time, the band played several UK tour dates, including 11 August 1986 at the Mardi Gras club in Liverpool with local promoter and record label owner Ken Kelly and his band Innervision, at which several record company executives would be in attendance.

As Brown and John Squire began collaborating more closely on songwriting, they decided to take a larger slice of the money than the other band members. Andy Couzens and Reni left the band in protest, although they soon returned. Couzens played an ill-fated gig with the band at the end of May before being pushed out of the band by Evans after flying home alone while the rest of the band returned in their van. Although they failed to achieve further success in 1986, their repertoire expanded to include songs such as &quot;Sugar Spun Sister&quot;, influenced by bands like The Jesus &amp; Mary Chain and the indie-pop era Primal Scream (&quot;Velocity Girl&quot; being a major influence on &quot;Made of Stone&quot;), and they stopped playing the older songs.

In December 1986, they recorded their first demo as a four-piece, including the first studio recordings of &quot;Sugar Spun Sister&quot; and &quot;Elephant Stone&quot;. In early 1987, Evans negotiated a deal with Black/FM Revolver for a one-off release on the specially created Black Records label. By the time of the release of the single &quot;Sally Cinnamon&quot;, the group&#x27;s sound had changed considerably, with chiming guitar hooks and a strong melody, alienating some of their old fans but attracting many new ones. &quot;Sally Cinnamon&quot; sold out its 1,000-copy run but failed to make the desired impact.

In June, Pete Garner announced that he had decided to leave the band, although he stayed until they found a replacement. He played his final gig with the band at the &#x27;Larks in the Park&#x27; festival in Liverpool. Rob Hampson was Garner&#x27;s replacement, with Garner teaching him the bass parts before leaving, although Hampson lasted only a week. A more permanent replacement was found in the form of former Waterfront bassist Mani, who played his first gig with the band in November 1987. Brown recalled, &quot;When Mani joined it almost changed overnight. It became a totally different groove ... Straight away, everything just fell into place&quot;.

In early 1988, the band played at Dingwalls in London, a show attended by representatives of Zomba and Rough Trade&#x27;s Geoff Travis, and both subsequently wanted to sign the band. Rough Trade even funded studio time to record a single, &quot;Elephant Stone&quot;, with Peter Hook producing. Hook was considered to produce an album for the band but was unavailable due to commitments with New Order, so Travis suggested John Leckie. In May, the band played a high-profile concert at Manchester&#x27;s International 2 with James, organized by Dave Haslam to raise funds for a campaign against Clause 28. The band attempted to usurp James by putting up posters around town listing the Stone Roses as headliners and delaying their start time to get the headline slot themselves and limit the time that James could play for. In the audience was a sixteen-year-old Liam Gallagher, who was inspired to form a band himself. Noel Gallagher also stated that he was inspired to do the same by attending one of their gigs. Also in the audience was Glaswegian Roddy McKenna, A&amp;R executive with Zomba, who later signed the band to the label. He asked if they could be transferred internally to Andrew Lauder&#x27;s newly created guitar-based Silvertone Records subsidiary. The band signed an eight-album deal, buying the &quot;Elephant Stone&quot; tapes from Rough Trade and releasing them as a single in October 1988.

The band were co-managed by Matthew Cummins, who died in 2007 following an accident. DJ Dave Booth was also influential in the band&#x27;s early days, supporting their live performances at warehouse parties.

===Debut album and breakthrough success (1989–1991)===
In 1988 and early 1989 the Stone Roses recorded their debut album at Battery Studios and Konk Studios in London and Rockfield Studios in Wales, produced by Leckie. The first single for Silvertone, &quot;Elephant Stone&quot;, made little impact, and in early 1989 the band&#x27;s performances outside the north-west were still attracting small audiences. &quot;Made of Stone&quot; received more press attention and was picked up for airplay by DJ Richard Skinner on his late night Radio One show, but peaked at number ninety on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;The Stone Roses&quot; was released in April / May 1989, initially to mostly positive reviews, and entered the UK Albums Chart at number 32 in mid-May, the highest position it would reach that year. This was followed with the single &quot;She Bangs the Drums&quot;, which gave them a top forty UK hit, and a number one on the UK Independent Chart, and by that point they were receiving much greater press attention and were selling out shows across the country. The band gained widespread notoriety when, one minute into a live 1989 TV performance on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Late Show&quot;, the power failed, prompting Ian Brown to repeatedly squeal &quot;Amateurs!&quot; at Tracey MacLeod. Later in 1989 the band released a double A-side single, &quot;Fools Gold/What the World Is Waiting For&quot;, which reached number eight on the UK Singles Chart in November. Originally intended as a B-side, &quot;Fools Gold&quot; quickly became the Roses&#x27; most famous song and a performance of it on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; cemented their national fame. It gave them their first top ten hit and the album rose to number nineteen in the chart early the following year.

Their biggest headline gigs in 1989 were to 4,000 people at Blackpool&#x27;s Empress Ballroom on Saturday 12 August and to 7,000 people at London&#x27;s Alexandra Palace on Saturday 18 November. The former of these was released as a live video in 1991 and later on YouTube.

The group won four &quot;NME&quot; Readers poll awards that year; Band of the Year, Best New Band, Single of the Year (for &quot;Fools Gold&quot;) and Album of the Year (for their debut album). &quot;The Stone Roses&quot; is now considered one of the greatest British albums, although the band themselves were unhappy with the sound on the album, Squire describing it as &quot;twee&quot; and not &quot;fat or hard enough&quot;. Ian Brown was quoted in &quot;NME&quot; in December 1989 as saying &quot;We&#x27;re the most important group in the world, because we&#x27;ve got the best songs and we haven&#x27;t even begun to show our potential yet.&quot;

In 1990, the Stone Roses&#x27; infamous paint attack on Revolver Records occurred, as a result of a conflict between the band and their label. The band was unhappy with how the label handled the release of their single &quot;Sally Cinnamon&quot; and the accompanying video without their permission.

To express their frustration, they decided to take matters into their own hands by visiting the label&#x27;s office and throwing paint at the staff and property, including Paul Birch, (the founder and owner of Revolver Record)&#x27;s wife. The incident caused significant damage and led to legal consequences for the band members. 
In a later TV interview, band member Gary Mounfield - known as Mani - spoke about the incident.
The bass guitarist said the group asked to stop at FADS DIY store in Northenden, on the outskirts of Manchester, to get tins of paint and overalls so guitarist John Squire could &#x27;do some art&#x27;.
The band were subsequently arrested and appeared at Wolverhampton Magistrates&#x27; Court charged with causing £15-20,000 worth of criminal damage.
But to counteract, following the incident, Mr Birch said he estimated that the media hype alone had bought the group in excess of a quarter of a million pounds in publicity.
Mani said that Geezer Butler and Tony Iommi from Black Sabbath congratulated them for the incident.

While the incident may be seen as a rebellious act by some, it also highlights the tension that can arise between artists and record labels. The Stone Roses&#x27; desire for creative control and their unconventional approach to the music industry led to this infamous event.

The Stone Roses&#x27; outdoor concert at Spike Island in Widnes on 27 May 1990 was attended by some 27,000 people, the support acts included; DJs Dave Haslam, Paul Oakenfold, Frankie Bones, Dave Booth, a Zimbabwean drum orchestra, and the reggae artist Gary Clail. The event, considered a failure at the time due to sound problems and bad organisation, has become legendary over the years as a &quot;Woodstock for the baggy generation&quot;. In mid-2010 footage of the concert was published on YouTube.

By July the band had released their final single for Silvertone, &quot;One Love&quot;, which reached number four in the UK Singles Chart, their highest placing yet. It was to be the Roses&#x27; last original release for four years as they entered a protracted legal battle to terminate their five-year contract with Silvertone, unhappy with how they had been paid by the label. Silvertone owners Zomba Records took out an injunction against the band in September 1990 to prevent them from recording with any other label, but in May 1991 the court sided with the group, which was then released from its contract. The Stone Roses subsequently signed with Geffen Records (garnering a million-pound advance for their next record) and began work on their second album. However, Silvertone appealed against the ruling, delaying the record for another year.

===&quot;Second Coming&quot; and breakup (1992–1996)===

Following the court case the Stone Roses separated themselves from Manchester&#x27;s club culture and spent much of 1992 and 1993 travelling in Europe before starting work on their second album in mid-1993. Progress was slow, hampered by Brown&#x27;s and Squire&#x27;s new fatherhood and the death of several people close to the band. John Leckie ultimately left the project as the band would not sign a production contract. Afterwards the Stone Roses assumed production duties with engineer Simon Dawson at Rockfield Studios in Wales, where they spent 347 ten-hour days working on the album.

The Stone Roses finally released the album, &quot;Second Coming&quot;, on 5 December 1994. Mostly written by John Squire, the music now had a shady, heavy blues rock sound, dominated by Squire&#x27;s guitar riffs and solos. &quot;Love Spreads&quot; reached number two on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Second Coming&quot; received a mixed reception from the British press, which music journalist Simon Reynolds attributed to &quot;the resentment that the Roses, divorced from the cultural moment that gave them meaning, were now just another band&quot;.

In March 1995, just two weeks before a tour in support of &quot;Second Coming&quot; was due to begin, Reni exited the band, following a disagreement with Ian Brown. A replacement drummer was found in Robbie Maddix, who had previously worked with Rebel MC. Also recruited around this time for the live shows was session-keyboardist/programmer Nigel Ippinson, who had previously played with the band on the &quot;Chic Remix&quot; re-working of &quot;Begging You&quot; for its release as a single. A secret &quot;come-back&quot; tour of the UK was planned for April 1995 but cancelled after the music press announced the dates. A major blow was the cancellation of their engagement at the Glastonbury Festival in June 1995. John Squire had suffered a mountain-biking accident in northern California weeks before the show, breaking his collarbone. The band finally organised a full UK tour for November and December 1995 and all dates sold out in a day.

John Squire announced his departure on 1 April 1996, releasing a statement saying it was: &quot;the inevitable conclusion to the gradual social and musical separation that we have undergone in the past few years&quot;. Simply Red&#x27;s 1987/88 tour guitarist Aziz Ibrahim, a former classmate of Pete Garner&#x27;s at Burnage High School, was recruited as a replacement. The band continued for another six months, but there was a noticeable deterioration in the quality of its public performances after Squire&#x27;s loss, and at Benicassim Festival and the Reading Festival Brown&#x27;s voice was described as &quot;so off-key it was excruciating to have to listen&quot;. The music press was united in its criticism, the &quot;NME&quot; describing &quot;I Am the Resurrection&quot; as &quot;more like the eternal crucifixion&quot;. Brown and Mani dissolved the group in October 1996.

===Post-Roses (1997–2010)===

Ian Brown, John Squire and Mani have all had successful careers since the Roses&#x27; breakup. Squire formed the Seahorses, who released one album before breaking up, as well as releasing two solo albums. In 2007 he told a reporter that he was giving up music for good to focus on his career as a painter. Brown has released seven solo albums, a remixes and a greatest hits collection all but one of which have charted in the top 5 of the UK Albums Chart. Mani joined Primal Scream as bassist in 1996 and remained in the band until the Stone Roses reunited.

Reni remained inactive for the most part after the Roses&#x27; breakup. He started a new band, The Rub, in 1999, and played several gigs but nothing has been heard of The Rub since. In an interview in 2005 he said he was writing new songs to perform with Mani.

Rumours of a reunion surfaced and were dismissed repeatedly in the time between the break-up and the eventual reunion.

The 20th-anniversary edition of the band&#x27;s debut album was released in August 2009, remastered by John Leckie and Ian Brown, including a collectors&#x27; box-set edition and the previously unreleased song &quot;Pearl Bastard&quot;.

===Reunion, new material and second disbandment (2011–2017)===

After the newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot; published a story on 14 October 2011 citing that the Roses had signed for a series of gigs across the UK, rumours again began to circulate. The &quot;NME&quot; reported that Alan &#x27;Reni&#x27; Wren had responded to these rumours, contacting them with a cryptic message that read: &quot;Not before 9T will I wear the hat 4 the Roses again&quot;. On 17 October, Dynamo told &quot;The Sun&quot; that Brown had confirmed the reunion by saying that the band were &quot;ready to take the world by storm&quot;, and that Brown had sent him a text message with the words &quot;It&#x27;s happening&quot;. On 18 October 2011, the Stone Roses announced at a press conference the end of a fifteen-year split. An &quot;extensive&quot; Reunion Tour of the world, starting in Warrington, for a low-key warm-up show, was scheduled. However, the main attractions of the tour were three homecoming shows at Heaton Park, Manchester, on 29–30 June and 1 July 2012 plus one show in Dublin&#x27;s Phoenix Park on 5 July 2012. In a press conference interview, the members of the Stone Roses said they had plans to record a third album. 150,000 tickets for the two Heaton Park shows sold out in 14 minutes, with the band then announcing a third show at the venue to be held on 1 July 2012. They then announced a show would take place in Ireland, with Ian Brown saying &quot;After Manchester, Ireland is always next on our list&quot;. The first leg of the tour would consist of two warm-up gigs in Barcelona in early June and then shows in the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Hungary, Germany and France.

On 2 December 2011, Ian Brown and John Squire performed together live for the first time since 1995. They joined Mick Jones from the Clash, the Farm and Pete Wylie at the Manchester Ritz in aid of the Justice for Hillsborough campaign. They performed on versions of the Clash&#x27;s &quot;Bankrobber&quot; and &quot;Armagideon Time&quot; as well as the Stone Roses&#x27; &quot;Elizabeth My Dear&quot;. On 23 May 2012, the Stone Roses held their first public concert since their reunion, playing an 11-song set before 1000 fans at Parr Hall in Warrington. The show, which was only announced that afternoon, was free to attend for those who brought a Stone Roses CD, LP or shirt with them.
On 26 November 2012, it was announced via the event&#x27;s Facebook page that the band would play the Isle of Wight Festival in June 2013. The Stone Roses played at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on 12 and 19 April 2013. The Stone Roses also played at Finsbury Park, London on 7 and 8 June 2013 and Glasgow Green, Glasgow on 15 June 2013.

A documentary was planned for the Stone Roses&#x27; reunion, with film director Shane Meadows chosen to film it. The documentary, titled &quot;The Stone Roses: Made of Stone&quot;, received its world premiere at Trafford Park in Manchester on 30 May 2013 and was simultaneously broadcast live in many cinemas across the United Kingdom. It had its general release on 5 June 2013.

On 2 November 2015, the band announced two gigs at Manchester&#x27;s City of Manchester Stadium on 17 and 18 June 2016 (a further two shows being added on 15 and 19 after these sold out), and a headline slot at the T in the Park 2016 festival on 8 July 2016 at Strathallan Castle, Scotland.

On 12 May 2016, the band released &quot;All for One&quot;, their first new release in more than 20 years. A second single, titled &quot;Beautiful Thing&quot;, was released on 9 June.

On 26 September 2016, the band announced three stadium gigs in the UK for 2017 - The SSE Arena in Belfast (Odyssey Complex) on 13 June, Wembley Stadium in London on 17 June and Hampden Park in Glasgow on 24 June. In December 2016, two more dates were added at the Leeds First Direct Arena on 20 and 21 June 2017.

On 24 June 2017, the Stone Roses played at Hampden Park in Glasgow. During the performance Ian Brown addressed the crowd with the statement: &quot;Don&#x27;t be sad that it&#x27;s over, be happy that it happened,&quot; leading many to speculate that the performance would be their final concert. This would turn out to be true, as on 16 September 2019, Squire confirmed in an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; that the band had disbanded.

==Musical style and influences==
The Stone Roses&#x27; influences included garage rock, electronic dance music, krautrock, northern soul, punk rock, reggae, soul and artists such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Simon and Garfunkel, the Smiths, the Byrds, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, the Jesus and Mary Chain, Sex Pistols and the Clash.

The band were part of the Madchester music scene, a music scene that mixed alternative rock, psychedelic rock and electronic dance music.

The band went on to influence other artists, most notably Oasis and the Verve, of which Noel Gallagher was quoted in an interview saying &quot;when I heard &#x27;Sally Cinnamon&#x27; for the first time, I knew what my destiny was&quot;. Gallagher&#x27;s brother and Oasis&#x27; lead singer Liam stated that they were the first band he saw live and that seeing them perform influenced him to become a singer. Kevin Cummins, photographer of the 18 November 1989 NME cover displaying the Stone Roses in blue paint, was reportedly told it was &quot;the greatest NME cover of all time&quot; by Liam Gallagher and Richard Ashcroft.

The band&#x27;s single &quot;This is the One&quot; has been played before Manchester United home matches at Old Trafford since the early 2000s.

==Relationship with the media==
As John Robb commented: &quot;The Stone Roses would stonewall the journalist[s]. With shy guffaws, muttered asides, dispassionate staring, foot-shuffling silences and complete mind-numbing gaps, punctuated by the odd piece of incisive home-spun philosophy from Brown, who occasionally hinted at a well-read mind. There would be complete silence from John Squire, witty banter from Reni, and Mani spouting off if he let his guard drop.&quot; However, Robb clarified they &quot;were no fools when it came to the media&quot;. He concluded: &quot;One feature of the band&#x27;s career had been their ability to stay on the news pages of the rock press almost permanently for years on end, including the years when they did fuck all. And they did this by hardly saying anything at all.&quot;

<text>Norman Quentin Cook (born Quentin Leo Cook, 31 July 1963), best known as Fatboy Slim, is an English musician who helped to popularise the big beat genre in the 1990s. In the 1980s, Cook was the bassist for the Hull-based indie rock band the Housemartins, who achieved a UK number-one single with their a cappella cover of &quot;Caravan of Love&quot;. After the Housemartins split up, Cook formed the electronic band Beats International in Brighton, who produced the number-one single &quot;Dub Be Good to Me&quot;. He then played in Freak Power, Pizzaman and the Mighty Dub Katz, with moderate success.

In 1996, Cook adopted the name Fatboy Slim and released &quot;Better Living Through Chemistry&quot; to critical acclaim. Follow-up albums &quot;You&#x27;ve Come a Long Way, Baby,&quot; &quot;Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars,&quot; and &quot;Palookaville&quot;, as well as singles such as &quot;The Rockafeller Skank&quot;, &quot;Praise You&quot;, &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot;, &quot;Weapon of Choice&quot; and &quot;Wonderful Night&quot;, achieved commercial and critical success. In 2008, Cook formed the Brighton Port Authority, a collaborative effort with a number of other established artists including David Byrne. He has been responsible for successful remixes for Cornershop, the Beastie Boys, A Tribe Called Quest, Groove Armada and Wildchild.

It was reported in 2008 that Cook held the Guinness World Record for most top-40 hits under different names. As a solo act, he has won a Grammy Award, nine MTV Video Music Awards and two Brit Awards, and was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Original Score in 2024.

== Life and career ==
=== 1963–1984: Early life and career beginnings ===

Cook was born in Bromley, Kent. He was raised in Reigate, Surrey, and educated at Reigate Grammar School, where he took violin lessons alongside the future prime minister Keir Starmer. In 2025, Cook said he was still in touch with Starmer. He completed his A-levels at Reigate College.

Cook grew up with a love of music. When he was 14, his brother brought home the first album from the punk band the Damned; he started attending punk gigs at the Greyhound pub in Park Lane, Croydon, and playing in punk bands. He played drums in Disque Attack, a British new wave-influenced rock band. When the frontman, Charlie Alcock, was told by his parents that he had to give up the band to concentrate on his O levels, Cook took over as lead vocalist. At the Railway Tavern in Reigate, during his time at Reigate College Cook met Paul Heaton, with whom he formed the Stomping Pond Frogs.

At 18, Cook went to Brighton Polytechnic to read a B.A. in English, politics and sociology, where he achieved a 2:1 in British Studies. He had begun DJing some years before, but it was at this time that he began to develop his skills in the thriving Brighton club scene, regularly appearing at the Brighton Belle and the Basement. There, known as DJ Quentox, he began laying the base for Brighton&#x27;s hip-hop scene.

=== 1985–1995: The Housemartins to the Mighty Dub Katz ===
In 1985, Heaton formed a guitar band, the Housemartins. Their original bassist, Ted Key, left on the eve of their first national tour, so Cook agreed to move to Hull to join them. The band soon had a hit single, &quot;Happy Hour&quot;, and their two albums, &quot;London 0 Hull 4&quot; and &quot;The People Who Grinned Themselves to Death&quot;, reached the Top 10 of the UK Albums Chart. They also reached number one just before Christmas 1986 with a version of &quot;Caravan of Love&quot;, originally a hit the year before for Isley-Jasper-Isley. By 1988 they had split up. Heaton and the drummer, Dave Hemingway, went on to form the Beautiful South, while Cook moved back to Brighton to pursue his interest in the style of music he preferred. He started working with the young studio engineer Simon Thornton, with whom he continues to make records.

Cook achieved his first solo hit in 1989, &quot;Blame It on the Bassline&quot;, featuring future Beats International member MC Wildski. Credited to &quot;Norman Cook feat. MC Wildski&quot;, the song followed the basic template of what would become Beats International&#x27;s style. It reached number 29 on the UK singles chart. 

Cook formed Beats International, a loose confederation of studio musicians including the vocalists Lindy Layton and Lester Noel, the rappers D.J. Baptiste and MC Wildski and the keyboardist Andy Boucher. Their first album, &quot;Let Them Eat Bingo&quot;, included the number-one single &quot;Dub Be Good to Me&quot;, which caused a legal dispute over allegations of copyright infringement through the liberal use of unauthorised samples: the bassline was taken from the Clash&#x27;s &quot;The Guns of Brixton&quot; and the chorus was an interpolation of the S.O.S. Band&#x27;s &quot;Just Be Good to Me&quot;. Cook lost the case and was ordered to pay back twice the royalties made on the record, bankrupting him. The 1991 follow-up album, &quot;Excursion on the Version&quot;, an exploration of dub and reggae music, did not chart.

Cook formed Freak Power with the horn player Ashley Slater and the singer Jesse Graham. They released their debut album &quot;Drive-Thru Booty&quot; in 1994, which contained the single &quot;Turn On, Tune In, Cop Out&quot;. Levi&#x27;s used the song in a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign. In 1996, Cook rejoined Freak Power for their second album, &quot;More of Everything for Everybody&quot;.

Cook enlisted help from producer friends Tim Jeffery and JC Reid to create a house music album as Pizzaman. The 1995 &quot;Pizzamania&quot; album spawned three UK Top 40 hits: &quot;Trippin&#x27; on Sunshine&quot;, &quot;Sex on the Streets&quot; and &quot;Happiness&quot;. Del Monte Foods corporation used &quot;Happiness&quot; in a UK fruit juice ad. The videos for the three singles were directed by Michael Dominic. Cook also formed the group The Mighty Dub Katz with Gareth Hansome (aka GMoney), his former flatmate. Together they started the Boutique Nightclub in Brighton, formerly known as the Big Beat Boutique. Their biggest song together was &quot;Magic Carpet Ride&quot;.

=== 1996–2008: Fatboy Slim ===
:&quot;We just got really, really drunk and wrote down a whole lot of names and then looked at them the next day and went, &quot;that&#x27;s the one.&quot; I really love old blues records. Really old, like pre-war blues. I love blues singers and a lot of them have really stupid names. There was like... Peetie Wheatstraw and Snooks Eaglin, Arthur Big Boy Crudup...&quot;

Cook adopted the pseudonym Fatboy Slim in 1995. He said of the name: &quot;It doesn&#x27;t mean anything. I&#x27;ve told so many different lies over the years about it I can&#x27;t actually remember the truth. It&#x27;s just an oxymoron—a word that can&#x27;t exist. It kind of suits me—it&#x27;s kind of goofy and ironic.&quot; The Fatboy Slim album and Cook&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Better Living Through Chemistry&quot; (released on Skint Records in the UK and Astralwerks in the US), contained the Top 40 UK hit &quot;Everybody Needs a 303&quot;.

Fatboy Slim&#x27;s next work was the single &quot;The Rockafeller Skank&quot;, using a keyboard, a Roland TB-303, an Akai S-950 and an Atari ST, with a C-Lab Creator sequencer and released before the album &quot;You&#x27;ve Come a Long Way, Baby&quot;, both of which were released in 1998. &quot;Praise You&quot;, also from this album, was Cook&#x27;s first UK solo number one. Its music video, starring Spike Jonze, won numerous awards. On 9 September 1999, he performed &quot;Praise You&quot; at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City and won three awards, including that for Breakthrough Video.

In 2000, Fatboy Slim released his third studio album &quot;Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars&quot; and featured two collaborations with Macy Gray and the track &quot;Weapon of Choice&quot;, which also was made into an award-winning music video starring Christopher Walken. The album also included &quot;Sunset (Bird of Prey),&quot; whose socially significant video sampled the 1964 &quot;Daisy Girl&quot; campaign ad. At the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards in New York, Fatboy Slim won six awards for &quot;Weapon of Choice&quot;, the most awards at the ceremony.

In 2003, he produced &quot;Crazy Beat&quot; and &quot;Gene by Gene&quot; from the Blur album &quot;Think Tank&quot; and in 2004, &quot;Palookaville&quot; was Cook&#x27;s first studio album for four years. Fatboy Slim&#x27;s greatest hits album &quot;Why Try Harder&quot; was released on 19 June 2006. It consists of 18 tracks, including ten Top 40 singles, a couple of Number Ones and two new tracks, &quot;Champion Sound&quot; and &quot;That Old Pair of Jeans&quot;.

In 2006, Cook travelled to Cuba and wrote and produced two original Cuban crossover tracks for the album &quot;The Revolution Presents: Revolution&quot;, which was released by Studio ! K7 and Rapster Records in 2009. The tracks are &quot;Shelter&quot; (which featured longtime collaborator Lateef) and &quot;Siente Mi Ritmo&quot;, featuring Cuba&#x27;s female vocal group Sexto Sentido. The recordings took place at Cuba&#x27;s EGREM Studios, home of the Buena Vista Social Club, and featured a band of young Cuban musicians, including Harold Lopez Nussa. Another track recorded during these sessions, &quot;Guaguanco&quot;, was released separately under the Mighty Dub Katz moniker in 2006.

=== 2008–2012: The Brighton Port Authority ===
The Brighton Port Authority debuted in 2008 with a collaboration with David Byrne and Dizzee Rascal titled &quot;Toe Jam&quot;, along with a video featuring nude dancers with censor bars on them, making pictures and words with them.

The soundtrack album for the TV series &quot;Heroes&quot; also includes the Brighton Port Authority&#x27;s track &quot;He&#x27;s Frank (Slight Return)&quot; (a cover of a song by The Monochrome Set), with Iggy Pop as vocalist. The video for this track features a near life-size puppet of Iggy Pop. An alternative club version was released under the title &quot;He&#x27;s Frank (Washing Up)&quot;, with the video featuring some footage of Iggy Pop acting and saying lyrics.

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;I Think We&#x27;re Gonna Need a Bigger Boat&quot;, is the first to be co-produced by Cook&#x27;s longtime engineer Simon Thornton, who also sings on one track. The album was released 6 January 2009 exclusively at Amazon.com on CD, with downloadable format and other stores scheduled for a month later on 3 February 2009.

In 2010, Cook released a mix album, &quot;The Legend Returns,&quot; as a covermount album in the June 2010 issue of &quot;Mixmag.&quot; He returned as Fatboy Slim when performing at Ultra Music Festival in Miami in March 2012. On 12 August 2012 he performed &quot;Rockefeller Skank&quot; and &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot; at the 2012 Summer Olympics Closing Ceremony, and on 1 September 2012 Cook performed at Brighton Pride.

=== 2013–present: Return of Fatboy Slim ===

On 20 June 2013, Cook released his first charting Fatboy Slim single in seven years; &quot;Eat, Sleep, Rave, Repeat&quot; with Riva Starr and Beardyman. Supported by a remix from Scottish DJ Calvin Harris, the song topped the UK Dance Chart that year. In 2015, Cook released a 15th-anniversary edition of &quot;Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars&quot;. This was supported with the release of miscellaneous remixes. In May 2015, Cook compiled &quot;The Fatboy Slim Collection,&quot; an album of songs used throughout his sets over the years.

In 2017, Fatboy Slim returned with his single &quot;Where U Iz&quot;, released on 3 March. Later that year, he released another collaboration with Beardyman titled &quot;Boom F**king Boom&quot;. In 2018, a remix album from Australian artists of Cook&#x27;s previous works was released, titled &quot;Fatboy Slim vs. Australia&quot;. In June 2023, Cook played at Glastonbury Festival. He performed the song &quot;Insomnia&quot; by Faithless as a tribute to Maxi Jazz. In June 2024, Fatboy Slim released a new single featuring vocalist Dan Diamond called &quot;Role Model.&quot; It comes with a music video, his first in nearly 20 years, and features many celebrities using deepfake technology such as David Bowie, Bill Murray and Muhammad Ali. On 28 June 2024, Cook appeared at Glastonbury with Paul Heaton on the Pyramid Stage.

Cook produced the single &quot;Mama Do the Hump&quot; by the Brighton band Rizzle Kicks released in December 2011 which peaked at number 2 in the charts. Cook has been responsible for successful remixes for Cornershop, Beastie Boys, A Tribe Called Quest and Wildchild.

== Performances ==
On Saturday, 13 July 2002, Fatboy Slim played at the second of his free open-air concerts on Brighton Beach, the Big Beach Boutique II. Although organisers expected a crowd of around 60,000 people, the event instead attracted an estimated 250,000 who crammed the promenade and beach between Brighton&#x27;s piers. Local police forced the event to end early amid safety concerns due to overcrowding. Shortly after the event there were two deaths, one due to a fall from the Upper Esplanade and one from a heart attack. After the show finished, major traffic congestion ensued throughout the Brighton area, with many caught in traffic jams until the morning.

In June 2005, Fatboy Slim filled the Friday night headline slot on the &quot;Other Stage&quot; at the Glastonbury Festival. In 2006, Fatboy Slim filled the Saturday headline slot at the Global Gathering festival at Long Marston Airfield in the English Midlands. He played a two-hour set, appearing in front of a visual stage set comprising video screens and 3D lighting. A fireworks display rounded off the show. Having been banned by police from playing in Brighton since 2002, Fatboy Slim was given permission in 2006 to play again in his home town. On 1 January 2007, he played to an audience of more than 20,000 fans along Brighton&#x27;s seafront. Tickets to the event, titled &quot;Fatboy Slim&#x27;s Big Beach Boutique 3&quot;, were made available only to individuals with a BN postcode. The concert was deemed a &quot;stunning success&quot; by Sussex police, Fatboy Slim and the crowd. The Cuban Brothers and David Guetta opened the concert. The next similar event, &#x27;Big Beach Boutique 4&#x27;, was held on 27 September 2008.

In 2008, Fatboy Slim played at the Glastonbury Festival again and headlined the O2 Wireless Festival and Rockness Festival.

In addition to his other 2011 performances, Fatboy Slim also played a headline gig at the Bestival on the Isle of Wight on 11 September.

In March 2012, Cook hosted a one-hour radio programme, titled &quot;On The Road To Big Beach Bootique 5&quot;, on XFM. It consisted of 10 shows.

He performed his famous &quot;The Rockafeller Skank&quot; (dubbed the &#x27;Funk Soul Brother&#x27;) at the closing ceremony for the 2012 Summer Olympics on top of a giant inflatable octopus, which emerged from the top of a party bus.

In July 2022, Cook returned to Brighton beach for the 20th anniversary of Big Beach Boutique. He was joined by Carl Cox, Eats Everything and others.

== Legacy ==
Known as DJ Quentox (The OX that Rocks), Cook and DJ Baptiste started putting on youth club hip hop jams in Brighton, sowing the seeds of the city&#x27;s flourishing hip hop scene today. These primitive 1980s block parties are recalled in the music documentary &quot;South Coast&quot;, which documents Brighton&#x27;s cult hip hop scene from its grass roots to the present day.
Cook was awarded a star on the city of Brighton&#x27;s Walk of Fame, next to that of Winston Churchill.
&quot;Q&quot; magazine named Fatboy Slim part of their &quot;50 Bands to See Before You Die&quot; list.

== Personal life ==
Cook married the TV presenter Zoe Ball in 1999 at Babington House in Somerset. In January 2003, they separated, but three months later they reconciled. Their daughter Nelly premiered a DJ set as Fat Girl Slim with Camp Bestival during the COVID-19 pandemic to raise money for the Ellen MacArthur Cancer Trust and The Trussell Trust. They lived in Western Esplanade, Portslade, Hove. On 24 September 2016, Cook and Ball announced their separation after 18 years. For a period, Cook lived near Paul McCartney, whom he described as a &quot;great neighbour&quot;. 

On 4 March 2009, Cook checked into a rehabilitation centre in Bournemouth for alcoholism. His performance at Snowbombing, a week-long winter sports and music festival held in the Austrian ski resort of Mayrhofen, was cancelled, with the slot filled by 2ManyDJs.

<text>George Catlett Marshall Jr. (31 December 1880 – 16 October 1959) was an American army officer and statesman. He rose through the United States Army to become Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army under presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, then served as Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense under Truman. Winston Churchill lauded Marshall as the &quot;organizer of victory&quot; for his leadership of the Allied victory in World War II. During the subsequent year, he attempted but failed to avoid the impending continuation of the Chinese Civil War. As Secretary of State, Marshall advocated for a U.S. economic and political commitment to post-war European recovery, including the Marshall Plan that bore his name. In recognition of this work, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1953, the only Army general ever to receive the honor.

Born in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, Marshall graduated from the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in 1901. He received his commission as a second lieutenant of Infantry in February 1902 and immediately went to the Philippines. He served in the United States and overseas in positions of increasing rank, including platoon leader and company commander in the Philippines during the Philippine–American War. He was the top-ranked of the five Honor Graduates of his Infantry-Cavalry School Course in 1907 and graduated first in his 1908 Army Staff College class. In 1916 Marshall was assigned as aide-de-camp to J. Franklin Bell, the commander of the Western Department. After the nation entered World War I in 1917, Marshall served with Bell, who commanded the Department of the East. He was assigned to the staff of the 1st Division; he assisted with the organization&#x27;s mobilization and training in the United States, as well as planning of its combat operations in France. Subsequently assigned to the staff of the American Expeditionary Forces headquarters, he was a key planner of American operations, including the Meuse-Argonne Offensive.

After the war, Marshall became an aide-de-camp to Army chief of staff John J. Pershing. Marshall later served on the Army staff, was the executive officer of the 15th Infantry Regiment in China and was an instructor at the Army War College. In 1927, he became assistant commandant of the Army&#x27;s Infantry School, where he modernized command and staff processes, which proved to be of major benefit during World War II. In 1932 and 1933, he commanded the 8th Infantry Regiment and Fort Screven, Georgia. Marshall commanded 5th Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division and Vancouver Barracks from 1936 to 1938; he received promotion to brigadier general. During this command, Marshall was also responsible for 35 Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camps in Oregon and Southern Washington. In July 1938, Marshall was assigned to the War Plans Division on the War Department staff; he later became the Army&#x27;s deputy chief of staff. When Chief of Staff Malin Craig retired in 1939, Marshall assumed the role of Chief of Staff in an acting capacity before his appointment to the position, which he held until the war&#x27;s end in 1945.

As Chief of Staff, Marshall, working closely with Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, organized the largest military expansion in U.S. history, and was promoted to five-star rank as General of the Army. Marshall coordinated Allied operations in Europe and the Pacific until the end of the war. In addition to accolades from Winston Churchill and other Allied leaders, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named Marshall its Man of the Year for 1943 and 1947. Marshall retired from active service in 1945, but remained on active duty, as required for holders of five-star rank. From 15 December 1945 to January 1947, Marshall served as a special envoy to China in an unsuccessful effort to negotiate a coalition government between the Nationalists of Chiang Kai-shek and the Communists of Mao Zedong.

As Secretary of State from 1947 to 1949, Marshall advocated rebuilding Europe, a program that became known as the Marshall Plan, and which led to his being awarded the 1953 Nobel Peace Prize. After resigning as Secretary of State, Marshall served as chairman of the American Battle Monuments Commission and president of the American National Red Cross. As Secretary of Defense at the start of the Korean War, Marshall worked to restore the military&#x27;s confidence and morale after the end of its post-World War II demobilization and then its initial buildup for combat in Korea and operations during the Cold War. Resigning as Defense Secretary, Marshall retired to his home in Virginia. He died in 1959 and was buried with honors at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Early life and education==
George Catlett Marshall Jr. was born in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, the youngest of three children born to George Catlett Marshall and Laura Emily (née Bradford) Marshall. Both sides of his family were long from Kentucky, but cherished their Virginia roots. He was also a first cousin, three times removed, of former chief justice John Marshall. He was also a distant cousin of Richard J. Marshall. Marshall&#x27;s father was active in the coal and coke business. Later, when asked about his political allegiances, Marshall often joked that his father had been a Democrat and his mother a Republican, whereas he was an Episcopalian.

Marshall was educated at Miss Alcinda Thompson&#x27;s private school in Uniontown and spent a year at Uniontown&#x27;s Central School. Having decided early in life that he desired a career in the military, but unlikely to obtain an appointment to the United States Military Academy because of his average grades, he looked to the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) for a formal education. Marshall&#x27;s brother Stuart, a VMI alumnus, believed George would not succeed and argued that their mother should not let George attend out of concern that he would &quot;disgrace the family name.&quot; Determined to &quot;wipe his brother&#x27;s face,&quot; Marshall enrolled at the age of sixteen in December 1897. To pay for his tuition and expenses, Marshall&#x27;s mother sold parcels of land she owned in Uniontown and Augusta, Kentucky.
At the start of his college career, Marshall was subjected to a hazing incident in which upperclassmen positioned an unsheathed bayonet with the point up and directed him to squat over it. After twenty minutes, Marshall fainted and fell. When he awoke, he had a deep laceration to one of his buttocks. While being treated for his injury, Marshall refused to inform on his classmates. Impressed with his bravery, the hazers never bothered him again.

During his years at VMI, Marshall always ranked first in military discipline and about midway academically. He attained the rank of first captain, the highest a cadet could achieve, and graduated 15th of 34 in the Class of 1901. Marshall received a diploma, not a degree. At the time of his graduation, the top five or six VMI graduates received bachelor&#x27;s degrees. The rest received diplomas attesting to their status as graduates. He played offensive tackle on the football team and in 1900 he was selected for All-Southern honors.

==Early infantry career and the Philippines==
Following his graduation from VMI, Marshall served as Commandant of Students at the Danville Military Institute in Danville, Virginia. He took a competitive examination for a commission in the United States Army, which had greatly expanded to deal with the Spanish–American War and Philippine–American War. Marshall passed and used endorsements his father obtained from both of Pennsylvania&#x27;s U.S. senators to bolster his application. VMI Superintendent Scott Shipp also supported Marshall&#x27;s application, and in a letter to President William McKinley compared him favorably to other VMI graduates serving in the Army, saying Marshall was &quot;Fully the equal of the best.&quot; He was commissioned a second lieutenant of Infantry in February 1902. In a matter of days he married, resigned the Danville job, and shipped out to serve with the 30th Infantry Regiment in the Philippines.

Prior to World War I, Marshall received various postings in the United States and the Philippines, including serving as an infantry platoon leader and company commander during the Philippine–American War and other guerrilla uprisings. He was schooled in modern warfare, including tours from 1906 to 1910 as both a student and an instructor. He was ranked first of five Honor Graduates of his Infantry-Cavalry School Course (now the United States Army Command and General Staff College) in 1907 and graduated first in his 1908 Army Staff College (now the United States Army War College) class. After graduating in 1908, Marshall was assigned as an instructor at the Infantry-Cavalry School.

After another tour of duty in the Philippines beginning in 1913, Marshall returned in 1916 to serve as aide-de-camp to Major General J. Franklin Bell, the commander of the Western Department and former Army chief of staff, at the Presidio of San Francisco. In the summer and fall of 1916, Marshall was responsible for organizing several Western Department Citizens&#x27; Military Training Camps. After the American entry into World War I in April 1917, Marshall relocated with Bell to Governors Island, New York, when Bell was reassigned as commander of the Department of the East. Shortly afterwards, Marshall was assigned to help oversee the mobilization of the 1st Division for service in France.

==World War I==
Shortly after the American entry into World War I in April 1917, Marshall had roles as a planner of both training and operations. In the summer, he was assigned as assistant chief of staff for operations on the staff of the newly created 1st Division, commanded by Major General William L. Sibert, a fifty-six-year-old engineer officer. After overseeing the division&#x27;s mobilization and organization in Texas, he departed for France with the division staff in mid-1917. On the long ocean voyage, his roommate was the division&#x27;s assistant chief of staff for training, Major Lesley J. McNair; the two formed a personal and professional bond that they maintained for the rest of their careers. Marshall was the first passenger from the first boat transporting American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) soldiers to set foot in Europe, and one of the first to enter the trenches of the Western Front.

After arriving in France, Marshall served with the 1st Division on the Saint-Mihiel, Picardy, and Cantigny fronts. Although the division was designated as a Regular Army formation, most of the officers and men serving within its ranks were almost completely lacking in combat experience. They were also deficient &quot;in training, staff work, and logistical problems. More than half of its soldiers were new recruits. Only a few of its non-commissioned officers had been in the Army for two years or more, and nearly all of the lieutenants had been commissioned less than six months&quot;.

In late 1917, General John J. Pershing, the commander-in-chief (C-in-C) of the AEF, inspected the 1st Division. Unimpressed by what he observed, Pershing began to berate the division commander, Major General Sibert, in front of his staff, including Marshall. Sibert took Pershing&#x27;s criticism in silence, but when Pershing turned his attention to the division chief of staff, Marshall angrily interceded to inform Pershing of logistical and administrative difficulties of which Pershing was unaware. Marshall also informed Pershing that the AEF staff had not been very helpful in dealing with the problems. Sibert and his staff were concerned that Marshall&#x27;s willingness to confront Pershing had probably cost him his career. Instead, Pershing began to seek out Marshall and ask for his advice whenever he visited the 1st Division, which, over the winter, &quot;completed extensive training, much of it under French tutelage&quot;. By mid-April 1918 the division, now commanded by Major General Robert Lee Bullard, was deemed to have progressed enough in its training to have its own sector of the Western Front to hold.

Marshall won recognition and acclaim for his planning of the Battle of Cantigny, which took place from 28 to 31 May 1918; Marshall&#x27;s success resulted in the first notable American victory of the war. As he conducted pre-attack planning, Marshall traveled alone under cover of darkness to personally view the terrain and mentally map it. Marshall ventured beyond the front lines and far into no-man&#x27;s land, often under friendly artillery fire and routinely risking discovery and capture by Imperial German Army troops. On 26 May, he was injured while traveling to several subordinate units to conduct pre-attack coordination. As he departed the division headquarters area, his horse stumbled, fell, and rolled over; Marshall&#x27;s left foot was caught in the stirrup, and he sustained a severe sprain and bruise. A physician bound Marshall&#x27;s injured ankle and foot with adhesive tape so he could avoid medical evacuation and remain with the division to oversee the attack. In 1920, Marshall was awarded the Citation Star for his heroism during this battle. When the Silver Star medal was created in 1932, Citation Stars were converted to the new award.

In mid-1918, Pershing brought Marshall on to the AEF operations staff, G-3, where he worked closely with Pershing and was a key planner of American operations. He was instrumental in the planning and coordination of the Meuse–Argonne offensive, which contributed to the defeat of the German Empire on the Western Front in 1918. Marshall held the permanent rank of captain and the temporary rank of colonel and was recommended for promotion to temporary brigadier general in October 1918, but the Armistice with Germany on 11 November 1918 occurred before the recommendation was acted on.

After the Armistice, Marshall served as chief of staff for the VIII Corps. For his services during the war he was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal, the citation for which reads:

==Between the wars==
After the war, Marshall reverted to his permanent rank of captain. In 1919, he became an aide-de-camp to General Pershing. Between 1920 and 1924, while Pershing was Army chief of staff, Marshall worked on a number of projects that focused on training and teaching modern, mechanized warfare. He taught at the Army War College and was a key planner in the War Department. He then served as executive officer of the 15th Infantry Regiment in the Republic of China, where he remained for three years and learned to speak basic Mandarin. In 1927, as a lieutenant colonel, he was appointed assistant commandant of the Infantry School at Fort Benning, where he initiated major changes to modernize command and staff processes, which proved to be of major benefit during World War II. Marshall placed Edwin F. Harding in charge of the Infantry School&#x27;s publications, and Harding became editor of &quot;Infantry in Battle&quot;, a book that codified the lessons of World War I. &quot;Infantry in Battle&quot; is still used as an officer&#x27;s training manual in the Infantry Officer&#x27;s Course and was the training manual for most of the infantry officers and leaders of World War II.

Marshall&#x27;s first wife died in 1927. The following year, while stationed at Fort Benning, Marshall met Katherine Tupper Brown at a dinner party. They married on 15 October 1930, at Emmanuel Episcopal Church in Baltimore, Maryland. The wedding made headlines as General Pershing served as Marshall&#x27;s best man.

From June 1932 to June 1933, Marshall was the commanding officer of the 8th Infantry Regiment at Fort Screven, Georgia. From July 1933 to October 1933 he was commander of Fort Moultrie, South Carolina, and District I of the Civilian Conservation Corps. He was promoted colonel in September 1933.

During the Great Depression, Marshall became a strong supporter of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal. Army chief of staff Douglas MacArthur, who was a Republican and with whom Marshall had a contentious relationship, did not appreciate Marshall&#x27;s views. After only a few months at Ft. Moultrie, MacArthur engineered Marshall&#x27;s abrupt transfer to Chicago, where he served as senior instructor and chief of staff for the Illinois National Guard&#x27;s 33rd Division from November 1933 to August 1936.
Marshall was assigned to command the 5th Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division and Vancouver Barracks in Vancouver, Washington, from 1936 to 1938, and was promoted to brigadier general in October 1936. In addition to obtaining a long-sought and significant troop command, traditionally viewed as an indispensable step to the pinnacle of the US Army, Marshall was also responsible for 35 Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camps in Oregon and southern Washington. As post commander Marshall made a concerted effort to cultivate relations with the city of Portland and to enhance the image of the US Army in the region. With the CCC, he initiated a series of measures to improve the morale of the participants and to make the experience beneficial in their later life. He started a newspaper for the CCC region that provided a vehicle to promote CCC successes, and he initiated a variety of programs that developed participants&#x27; skills and improved their health. Marshall&#x27;s inspections of the CCC camps gave him and his wife Katherine the chance to enjoy the beauty of the American Pacific Northwest and made that assignment what he called &quot;the most instructive service I ever had, and the most interesting.&quot;

In July 1938, Marshall was assigned to the War Plans Division in Washington, D.C., and subsequently reassigned as Deputy Chief of Staff. In that capacity, then-Brigadier General Marshall attended a White House conference at which President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed a plan to expand the United States Army Air Corps by 15,000 aircraft per year in preparation for World War II. With all other attendees voicing support, Marshall was the only one to disagree, pointing out the lack of consideration for logistical support or training. Marshall also spoke in favor of a large ground army although Roosevelt had said a large air force would be a greater deterrent to enemies, pointing out that the United States Army did not yet have a single division at full operational strength. Despite others&#x27; belief then that Marshall had ended his career, his willingness to express disagreement resulted in Roosevelt nominating Marshall to be the Army Chief of Staff.

Upon the retirement of General Malin Craig on 1 July 1939, Marshall became acting chief of staff. Several generals were candidates to succeed Craig, including Hugh Aloysius Drum. Roosevelt favored Marshall because he was more supportive of New Deal liberalism than the conservative and still-influential Douglas MacArthur, who had been chief of staff from 1930 to 1935, and because of the recommendations of Pershing, Craig, Louis A. Johnson, and Roosevelt&#x27;s close advisor Harry Hopkins. Marshall was sworn in as chief of staff on 1 September 1939, just hours after the Wehrmacht launched its invasion of Poland. He held this post until retiring in November 1945. At the time of the appointment, Marshall was 34th in seniority, outranked by 21 major generals and 11 brigadier generals, but he was fifth under an unwritten rule that the chief of staff should be able to serve a four-year term before reaching the mandatory retirement age of 64.

On 11 May 1940, the United States Congress cut $10 million from a $28 million appropriation budget for equipment to detect Imperial Japanese Armed Forces aircraft off the West Coast of the United States. Marshall met with Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr. and they went to see Roosevelt; Marshall emphasized the supreme importance of getting the full amount and told Roosevelt &quot;you have got to do something and you&#x27;ve got to do it today&quot;. Marshall&#x27;s advocacy worked and he got &quot;all he wanted and more&quot;.

In 1941, Marshall became a Freemason, raised &quot;at sight&quot; by the grand master of the Grand Lodge of the District of Columbia. (&quot;At sight&quot; is the procedure by which a grand master confers on a candidate all three Masonic degrees – Apprentice, Fellowcraft, and Master – at one time.)

==World War II==

As Chief of Staff, Marshall organized the largest military expansion in American history, inheriting an outmoded, poorly equipped army of 189,000 men and, partly drawing from his experience teaching and developing techniques of modern warfare as an instructor at the Army War College, coordinated the large-scale expansion and modernization of the U.S. Army. Under his name were produced significant works of doctrine such as Field Manual 100-5. During his first week in office, he advised Roosevelt to issue an executive order expanding the Regular Army to 227,000 troops and the National Guard to 235,000 reservists, although the President could not immediately act because the United States Congress still favored isolationism.

Marshall&#x27;s efforts to expand the United States Armed Forces began to have more success after the Axis powers conquered most of Western Europe in the Battle of France. Beginning in July 1940, he was greatly assisted in this effort by newly appointed Secretary of War Henry Stimson, whom Marshall would gradually displace as the most significant leader of the U.S. military apparatus in a deviation from the United States&#x27; tradition of civilian control of the military. Though he had never actually led troops in combat, Marshall was a skilled organizer with a talent for inspiring other officers. Many of the American generals who were given top commands during the war were either picked or recommended by Marshall, including Dwight D. Eisenhower, Jacob L. Devers, George S. Patton, Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr., Lloyd Fredendall, Lesley J. McNair, Mark Wayne Clark and Omar Bradley.

===Expands military force fortyfold===

Faced with the necessity of turning former civilians into an army of over eight million soldiers by 1942 (a fortyfold increase within three years), Marshall directed McNair as commander of Army Ground Forces to focus efforts on rapidly producing large numbers of soldiers. With the exception of airborne forces, Marshall approved McNair&#x27;s concept of an abbreviated training schedule for men entering Army land forces training, particularly in regard to basic infantry skills, weapons proficiency, and combat tactics. At the time, most U.S. commanders at lower levels had little or no combat experience of any kind. Without the input of experienced British or Allied combat officers on the nature of modern warfare and enemy tactics, many resorted to formulaic training methods emphasizing static defense and orderly large-scale advances by motorized convoys over improved roads. In consequence, Army forces deploying to Africa in Operation Torch suffered serious initial reverses when they encountered German armored units in Africa in the Battle of Kasserine Pass and other major battles. Even as late as 1944, American soldiers undergoing stateside training in preparation for deployment against German forces in Europe were not being trained in combat procedures and tactics in use there.

===Replacement system criticized===

Originally, Marshall had planned a 265-division army with a system of unit rotation such as that practiced by the British and other Allies. By mid-1943, however, after pressure from government and business leaders to preserve manpower for industry and agriculture, he had abandoned this plan in favor of a 90-division Army using individual replacements sent via a circuitous process from training to divisions in combat. The individual replacement system devised by Marshall and implemented by McNair exacerbated problems with unit cohesion and effective transfer of combat experience to new soldiers and officers. In Europe, where there were few pauses in combat with German forces, the individual replacement system had broken down completely by late 1944. Hastily trained replacements or service personnel reassigned as infantry were often given only a few weeks&#x27; refresher training before being thrown into battle with Army divisions locked in front-line combat.

The new men were often not even proficient in the use of their own weapons, and once in combat, could not receive enough practical instruction from veterans before being killed or wounded, sometimes within the first few days. Under such conditions, many soldiers suffered a crippling loss of morale, while veterans were kept at the front until they were killed, wounded, or incapacitated by battle fatigue or illness. Incidents of soldiers going AWOL from combat duty as well as battle fatigue and self-inflicted injury rose rapidly during the last eight months of the war with Nazi Germany. As one historian concluded, &quot;Had the Germans been given a free hand to devise a replacement system..., one that would do the Americans the most harm and the least good, they could not have done a better job.&quot;

Marshall&#x27;s abilities to pick competent field commanders during the early part of the war was decidedly mixed. He was instrumental in advancing the careers of the highly capable generals such as Dwight D. Eisenhower, Omar Bradley, George S. Patton, Walter Krueger and Mark W. Clark. A notable exception was his recommendation of the swaggering Lloyd Fredendall to Eisenhower for a major command in the American invasion of North Africa during Operation Torch. Marshall was especially fond of Fredendall, describing him as &quot;one of the best&quot; and remarking in a staff meeting when his name was mentioned, &quot;I like that man; you can see determination all over his face.&quot; Eisenhower duly picked him to command the 39,000-man Central Task Force (the largest of three) in Operation Torch. Both men would come to regret that decision, as Fredendall was the leader of U.S. Army forces at the disastrous Battle of Kasserine Pass.

===Planned invasion of Europe===
During World War II, Marshall was instrumental in preparing the U.S. Army and Army Air Forces for the invasion of Continental Europe. Marshall wrote the document that would become the central strategy for all Allied operations in Europe. During the Arcadia Conference, he convinced the United Kingdom to accept this strategy, including the focus on defeating Germany first and the establishment of international unified commands in control of all Allied forces in a given theatre. His push for unity of command, in particular through the Combined Chiefs of Staff and the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command, met with resistance from the British Armed Forces under Alan Brooke because the scheme would allow the United States to dominate the Western Allied war effort, but the British government ultimately approved.

He initially scheduled Operation Overlord for 1 April 1943, but met with strong opposition from Winston Churchill, who convinced Roosevelt to commit troops to Operation Husky for the invasion of Italy. Marshall and his advisors also opposed the Allied invasion of French North Africa after it became clear that Vichy France would offer resistance, concerns over an Axis intervention through Francoist Spain and Gibraltar, and suspicions that the operation was intended to defend European colonial territory with little strategic value to the war.
When rumors circulated that Marshall would become the Supreme Commander of Operation Overlord, many critics viewed the potential transfer as a demotion, since he would leave his position as Chief of Staff of the Army and lose his seat on the Combined Chiefs of Staff. While Marshall enjoyed considerable success in working with Congress and Roosevelt, he refused to lobby for the position. Roosevelt selected Eisenhower, in large part because he did not want to do without Marshall in the Chief of Staff position. He told Marshall, &quot;I didn&#x27;t feel I could sleep at ease if you were out of Washington.&quot;

On 16 December 1944, Marshall became the first American general to be promoted to the newly created rank of general of the Army, a five-star rank that placed senior American commanders on an equal footing with the field marshals of European Allies; Marshall had objected to being awarded the title of field marshal, as it would have given him the title of &quot;Marshal Marshall&quot;.

Throughout the remainder of World War II, Marshall coordinated Allied operations in both Europe and the Pacific. He was characterized as the organizer of Allied victory by Churchill. &quot;Time&quot; magazine named Marshall Man of the Year for 1943. Marshall resigned his post of chief of staff on 18 November 1945, but did not retire, as regulations stipulate that generals of the Army remain on active duty for life. He was succeeded as Army chief of staff by General of the Army Dwight Eisenhower. During this time, he also received a Bronze oak leaf cluster to his Army DSM for his unprecedented work from 1939 to 1945. The medal&#x27;s citation reads:

=== Analysis of Pearl Harbor intelligence failure ===

After World War II ended, the Congressional Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack received testimony on the intelligence failure. It amassed 25,000 pages of documents, 40 volumes, and included nine reports and investigations, eight of which had been previously completed. These reports included criticism of Marshall for delaying sending Lieutenant General Walter Short, the Army commander in Hawaii, important information obtained from intercepted Japanese diplomatic messages. The report also criticized Marshall&#x27;s lack of knowledge of the readiness of the Hawaiian Command during November and December 1941. Marshall also advised President Roosevelt to move part of the United States Pacific Fleet to the Atlantic Ocean to assist Neutrality Patrols, and that the defenses at Oahu made a Japanese attack on the island impossible. These recommendations were dismissed by the President but could have been catastrophic if they had not been.

Ten days after the attack, Short and Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, commander of the United States Pacific Fleet at Naval Station Pearl Harbor, were both relieved of their duties. The final report of the Joint Committee did not single out or fault Marshall. While the report was critical of the overall situation, the committee noted that subordinates had failed to pass on important information to their superiors, including to Marshall.

A secret review of the Army&#x27;s role, which resulted in the Clausen Report, was authorized by Secretary Henry Stimson. The report was critical of Short and also of Colonel Rufus S. Bratton of the Military Intelligence Division (G-2), who investigator Henry Clausen concluded arrived at the War Department later on the morning of 7 December 1941 than he initially claimed during testimony and invented a story about a warning to affected army commanders about the imminent Pearl Harbor Attack being delayed because he had been unable to get in touch with Marshall, an allegation which &quot;nearly destroyed&quot; Marshall.

== Mission to China ==
Only weeks after Marshall&#x27;s retirement, in December 1945, President Harry Truman dispatched Marshall to the Republic of China, where he had served in the 1920s. His new mission was to prevent a resumption of the Chinese Civil War by brokering a coalition government between America&#x27;s Kuomintang allies under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and the Chinese Communist Party of Mao Zedong. Marshall had no leverage over the Communists but threatened to withdraw American aid essential to the Nationalists. Both sides rejected his proposals and he returned to the United States in January 1947. As Secretary of State, Marshall disagreed with the Defense and State Department views that Chiang&#x27;s success was vital to American interests, insisting that U.S. troops not become involved. The war continued, and the Communists won in 1949.

==Secretary of State==
After Marshall&#x27;s return to the U.S. in early 1947, Truman appointed him Secretary of State. As one of the most well-regarded and least politicized national leaders, he made an ideal front office personality. He became the spokesman for the State Department&#x27;s ambitious plans to rebuild Europe. He did not design the plans and paid little attention to details or negotiations. Nor did he keep current on details of foreign affairs. As one biographer notes, he had never been a workaholic. He turned over major responsibilities to his deputies, especially Under-Secretary Robert A. Lovett, and refused to be troubled by minutiae. By 1948, with frailties building up, his participation was further curtailed. Marshall said, &quot;The fact of the matter is that Lovett bears the principal burden as I get away whenever possible.&quot;

On 5 June 1947, in a speech at Harvard University, he outlined the American proposal. The European Recovery Program, as it was formally known, became known as the Marshall Plan. Clark Clifford had suggested to Truman that the plan be called the Truman Plan, but Truman immediately dismissed that idea and insisted that it be called the Marshall Plan. The Marshall Plan would help Europe rebuild and modernize its economy along American lines and open up new opportunities for international trade. Stalin ordered his satellites in Eastern Europe not to participate. Marshall was again named &quot;Man of the Year&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; in January 1948.

Truman repeatedly rejected Marshall&#x27;s advice on Middle Eastern policy. As Secretary of State, Marshall strongly opposed recognizing the newly formed state of Israel. Marshall felt that if the state of Israel was declared, a war would break out in the Middle East (which it did when the 1948 Arab–Israeli War began one day after Israel declared independence). Marshall saw recognizing the Jewish state as a political move to gain American Jewish support in the upcoming election, in which Truman was expected to lose to Thomas E. Dewey. He told President Truman in May 1948, &quot;If you [recognize the state of Israel] and if I were to vote in the election, I would vote against you.&quot; However, Marshall refused to vote in any election as a matter of principle.

During his tenure as Secretary of State, Marshall also urged Truman to immediately call for The Netherlands to stop their invasion of Indonesia, a former Dutch colony which had declared independence in 1945. The Netherlands ignored the Truman administration&#x27;s initial entreaties. As a result, the Marshall Plan program for the Netherlands&#x27; economic recovery was put on hold and the Truman administration threatened to cut all economic aid. The Netherlands finally agreed to withdraw and transferred sovereignty following the Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference in 1949.

Marshall resigned as Secretary of State because of ill health on 7 January 1949. He was severely exhausted throughout his tenure in the position. Dean Acheson in late 1947 said he was underperforming like &quot;a four-engine bomber going only on one engine.&quot; Truman named him to the largely honorific positions of chairman of the American Battle Monuments Commission and president of the American National Red Cross. He received the 1953 Nobel Peace Prize for his post-war work, despite the criticism that he was a warrior not a pacifist.

==Secretary of Defense==

When the early months of the Korean War showed how poorly prepared the Defense Department was, President Truman fired Secretary Louis A. Johnson and named Marshall as Secretary of Defense in September 1950. The appointment required a congressional waiver because the National Security Act of 1947 prohibited a uniformed military officer from serving in the post. This prohibition included Marshall since individuals promoted to General of the Army are not technically retired but remain officially on active duty. Marshall was the first person to be granted such a waiver; in 2017, Jim Mattis became the second and in January 2021, General Lloyd Austin became the third. Marshall&#x27;s main role as Secretary of Defense was to restore confidence and morale to the Defense Department while rebuilding the United States Armed Forces following their post-World War II demobilization.

===Korean War===

Marshall worked to provide more manpower to meet the demands of both the Korean War and the Cold War in Europe. To implement his priorities Marshall brought in a new leadership team, including Robert A. Lovett as his deputy and Anna M. Rosenberg, former head of the War Manpower Commission, as assistant secretary of defense for manpower. He also worked to rebuild the relationship between the Defense and State Departments, as well as the relationship between the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Marshall participated in the post-Inchon landing discussion that led to authorizing Douglas MacArthur to conduct the UN offensive into North Korea. A secret &quot;eyes only&quot; signal from Marshall to MacArthur on 29 September 1950, declared the Truman administration&#x27;s commitment: &quot;We want you to feel unhampered strategically and tactically to proceed north of the 38th Parallel&quot;. At the same time, Marshall advised against public pronouncements which might lead to United Nations votes undermining or countermanding the initial mandate to restore the border between North and South Korea. Marshall and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were generally supportive of MacArthur because they were of the view that field commanders should be able to exercise their best judgment in accomplishing the intent of their superiors.

Following Chinese military intervention in Korea during late November, Marshall and the Joint Chiefs of Staff sought ways to aid MacArthur while avoiding all-out war with China. In the debate over what to do about China&#x27;s increased involvement, Marshall opposed a cease-fire on the grounds that it would make the U.S. look weak in China&#x27;s eyes, leading to demands for future concessions. In addition, Marshall argued that the U.S. had a moral obligation to honor its commitment to South Korea. When British Prime Minister Clement Attlee suggested diplomatic overtures to China, Marshall opposed, arguing that it was impossible to negotiate with the Communist government. In addition, Marshall expressed concern that concessions to China would undermine confidence in the U.S. among its Asian allies, including Japan and the Philippines. When some in Congress favored expanding the war in Korea and confronting China, Marshall argued against a wider war in Korea, continuing instead to stress the importance of containing the Soviet Union during the Cold War battle for primacy in Europe.

====Relief of General MacArthur====

Increasingly concerned about public statements from MacArthur, commander of United Nations Command forces fighting in the Korean War, which contradicted President Truman&#x27;s on prosecution of the war, on the morning of 6 April 1951, Truman held a meeting with Marshall, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Omar Bradley, Secretary of State Dean Acheson and advisor W. Averell Harriman to discuss whether MacArthur should be removed from command.

Harriman was emphatically in favor of MacArthur&#x27;s relief, but Bradley opposed it. Marshall asked for more time to consider the matter. Acheson was in favor but did not disclose this, instead warning Truman that if he did it, MacArthur&#x27;s relief would cause &quot;the biggest fight of your administration.&quot; At another meeting the following day, Marshall and Bradley continued to oppose MacArthur&#x27;s relief. On 8 April, the Joint Chiefs of Staff met with Marshall, and each expressed the view that MacArthur&#x27;s relief was desirable from a &quot;military point of view,&quot; suggesting that &quot;if MacArthur were not relieved, a large segment of our people would charge that civil authorities no longer controlled the military.&quot;

Marshall, Bradley, Acheson, and Harriman met with Truman again on 9 April. Bradley informed the President of the views of the Joint Chiefs, and Marshall added that he agreed with them. Truman wrote in his diary that &quot;it is of unanimous opinion of all that MacArthur be relieved. All four so advise.&quot; (The Joint Chiefs would later insist that they had only &quot;concurred&quot; with the relief, not &quot;recommended&quot; it.)

On 11 April 1951, Truman directed transmittal of an order to MacArthur, issued over Bradley&#x27;s signature, relieving MacArthur of his assignment in Korea and directing him to turn over command to Matthew Ridgway. In line with Marshall&#x27;s view, and those of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, MacArthur&#x27;s relief was looked upon by proponents as being necessary to reassert the tenet of civilian control of the military.

==Later life==
===Retirement===
In September 1951, after 49 years of continuous public service, Marshall retired to his home, Dodona Manor, in Leesburg, Virginia. Purchased by the Marshalls in 1941, Dodona had previously served as a quiet weekend retreat for the busy couple. The home was restored beginning in the 1990s and the house and its gardens are open to the public as a museum.

It was at Dodona Manor that Marshall enjoyed his favorite food, roast leg of lamb, and his favorite beverage, an old fashioned. Gardening was one of Marshall&#x27;s favorite pastimes, and in retirement he grew vegetables throughout the year, including tomatoes and pumpkins, while Katherine Marshall enjoyed tending to her rose garden. In a 1942 letter to David Burpee, president of the W. Atlee Burpee &amp; Company, Marshall wrote, &quot;The business of seeds and flowers tantalizes me because I have been an amateur gardener, both flower and vegetable, since a boy of ten. There is nothing I would so much prefer to do this spring as to turn my mind to the wholesome business of gardening rather than the terrible problems and tragedies of war.&quot;

Katherine&#x27;s love of roses was well known, leading inventor Eugene S. Boerner to create the Katherine Tupper Marshall Rose, a pink hybrid tea rose. It was patented by Jackson and Perkins in 1943.

===American Battle Monuments Commission===
Throughout his retirement, Marshall served as chairman of the American Battle Monuments Commission. He oversaw the construction of fourteen cemeteries in eight countries following World War II to memorialize those killed or missing in battle. In the early 1950s, Marshall argued for the speedy construction and funding of cemeteries despite budget and staff cuts for the Korean War. Marshall wrote to General Joseph McNarney in March 1951 saying, &quot;I am naturally hesitant to become personally involved in individual personnel problems, but in this case, am deeply concerned about the overall moral factor if our foreign national cemeteries are not adequately maintained...&quot; Marshall&#x27;s efforts to secure building and maintenance staff for the cemeteries were successful, doubling the number of military officers assigned to the work. On 13 September 1952, Marshall attended the dedication ceremony of Suresnes American Cemetery in France.

===Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II===
After retiring, Marshall largely withdrew from public life. A notable exception was in June 1953, when he accepted President Eisenhower&#x27;s appointment to head the American delegation to the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The delegation included Earl Warren and Omar Bradley, and according to Bradley, as Marshall walked up the aisle of Westminster Abbey to take his seat before the ceremony, the congregation rose to its feet as a gesture of respect. Marshall looked behind him to see who the arriving dignitary was, then realized the congregation had stood for him. Marshall was also invited to the post-ceremony banquet at Buckingham Palace, and was the only non-royal seated at Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s table.

==Family life==

George Marshall was the youngest of three siblings. His older brother Stuart Bradford Marshall (1875–1956) was a graduate of the Virginia Military Institute and became a manager and executive in several metal production corporations, including the American Manganese Manufacturing Company. He later worked as a metallurgist and consulting engineer specializing in the production and operation of blast furnaces, coke ovens, and foundries. George and Stuart Marshall were long estranged because George married Lily Coles, who a few years before had rejected Stuart&#x27;s proposal. When Stuart found out George was engaged to Lily, Stuart made unkind remarks about her, and George &quot;cut him off my list.&quot; Marshall&#x27;s sister, Marie Louise (1876–1962) was the wife of John Johnson Singer, an Army physician who died in 1934.

On 11 February 1902, Marshall married Elizabeth Carter &quot;Lily&quot; Coles at her mother&#x27;s home in Lexington, Virginia. Marshall met Lily after listening to her play the piano across the street from VMI. Marshall, being immediately smitten, would &quot;run the block&quot;, or leave barracks after hours, to be with her. After traveling abroad to Japan, Korea, and China with Marshall, Lily returned to the U.S. to have a goiter removed. She died on 15 September 1927, after thyroid surgery that strained her weak heart. They did not have children.

On 15 October 1930, Marshall married Katherine Boyce Tupper (8 October 1882 – 18 December 1978); They had no children, but she was the mother of three children with Baltimore lawyer Clifton Stevenson Brown. He had been murdered by a disgruntled client in 1928. The second Mrs. Marshall was a graduate of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts; she later studied at the Comédie-Française and toured with Frank Benson&#x27;s English Shakespearean Company. She authored a memoir in 1946, &quot;Together: Annals of an Army Wife&quot;.

One of Marshall&#x27;s stepsons, Allen Tupper Brown, was an Army lieutenant who was killed in Italy on 29 May 1944. Another stepson was Major Clifton Stevenson Brown Jr. (1914–1952). Stepdaughter Molly Brown Winn, the mother of actress Kitty Winn, was married to Colonel James Julius Winn, who had been an aide to Marshall. Molly Winn was active in preserving Marshall&#x27;s legacy, including preserving Dodona Manor and publishing Marshall&#x27;s World War I memoirs.

==Death and burial==

After a series of strokes, Marshall died at Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, D.C., on 16 October 1959, two months shy of his 79th birthday. Although he was entitled to official proceedings, Marshall preferred simplicity, so he received a special military funeral that dispensed with many of the usual activities. The ceremonies included lying in state at Washington National Cathedral for 24 hours, guarded by representatives from each U.S. armed service and a VMI cadet.

President Eisenhower ordered flags flown at half-staff and was among the 200 guests invited for the funeral service held at Fort Myer. Other dignitaries included former President Truman, Secretary of State Christian A. Herter, former Secretary of State Dean Acheson, former Governor W. Averell Harriman and Generals Omar N. Bradley, Alfred M. Gruenther, and Matthew B. Ridgway. His parish priest, Franklin Moss Jr., from St. James Episcopal Church in Leesburg conducted the chapel and graveside services, assisted by former chief chaplain and National Cathedral Canon the Reverend Luther Miller. In accordance with Marshall&#x27;s wishes, there was no eulogy. Following the burial service, an artillery battery fired a 19-gun salute and a bugler played taps. The flag that draped Marshall&#x27;s casket was folded and given to Mrs. Marshall by a VMI cadet.

Marshall was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, Section 7, Grave 8198, beside his first wife and her mother, Elizabeth Pendleton Coles (1849–1929). His second wife was also buried with him after she died on 18 December 1978. On its reverse side, the marble headstone lists General Marshall&#x27;s positions held: &quot;Chief of Staff U.S. Army, Secretary of State, President of American Red Cross, Secretary of Defense.&quot; The five-star rank adorns both sides of the stone.

==Reputation and legacy==

As William Taylor and other historians have recently emphasized, George Marshall was the best-known and most active – and most selfless – American leader in the early Cold War. His leadership had a distinct, signature style which contained &quot;Disdain for false speaking and dissembling&quot;, &quot;Aura of Authority&quot; and &quot;Immensity of Integrity&quot;. He viewed his world in definitive black and white with no vagueness in arguments or gray areas in decision-making. Marshall is best known for giving his name and prestige to the Marshall Plan to rebuild the European economy. However, he suffered several defeats – he failed in the year-long effort to resolve the Chinese Civil War; he was defeated in his proposal to impose universal military service on all American men; and he was overruled by President Truman when he opposed the recognition of Israel. Historians agree that Truman depended heavily upon Marshall&#x27;s prestige at a time of intensely bitter partisanship. Wilson Miscamble points to Marshall&#x27;s delayed recognition of the threat posed by the Soviet Union – not until April 1947 did he realize the dangers. Miscamble concludes that recent studies show that Marshall was:An important contributor but hardly a dominant figure in the making of postwar American foreign policy. He had a special gift for delegation and he drew forth impressive contributions from various capable subordinates.
Marshall&#x27;s reputation for excellence as a military organizer and planner was recognized early in his career and became known throughout the Army. In a performance appraisal prepared while Marshall was a lieutenant in the Philippines, his superior, Captain E. J. Williams responded to the routine question of whether he would want the evaluated officer to serve under his command again by writing of Marshall &quot;Should the exigencies of active service place him in exalted command I would be glad to serve &quot;under him&quot;.&quot; (Emphasis added)

In 1916, Lieutenant Colonel Johnson Hagood completed a written evaluation of Marshall&#x27;s performance in which he called Marshall a military genius. Responding to the question of whether he would want his subordinate Marshall to serve under him again, Hagood wrote &quot;Yes, but I would prefer to serve &quot;under his command&quot;.&quot; (Emphasis added) Hagood went on to recommend Marshall&#x27;s immediate promotion to brigadier general, despite the fact that there were more than 1,800 officers, including Hagood, who were senior to him.

After the surrender of the Nazi German government in May 1945, Henry L. Stimson, the Secretary of War, paid tribute to Marshall in front of a gathering of members of the Army staff, concluding with: &quot;I have seen a great many soldiers in my lifetime and you, Sir, are the finest soldier I have ever known.&quot;

Historians credit the high regard others had for Marshall&#x27;s personal integrity as another reason for his positive legacy. In addition to his willingness to confront Pershing over Pershing&#x27;s berating of the 1st Division chief of staff during World War I, Marshall cited other instances where he provided persistent advice that kept Pershing from creating needless controversy. In one, Marshall recalled a time when Pershing and James Harbord intended to change a War Department policy implemented by Peyton March, the chief of staff of the Army and Pershing&#x27;s nominal superior, with whom Pershing had a long-running feud. Marshall counseled against it several times, and Pershing angrily indicated that his chief of staff Harbord and he intended to submit their proposal despite Marshall&#x27;s advice. Rather than concede, Marshall replied that Pershing was letting his personal feud with March cloud his judgment and that Harbord, who also disliked March, was doing the same. Instead of continuing to &quot;pull rank&quot;, Pershing yielded to Marshall&#x27;s judgment and said &quot;Well, have it your own way.&quot;

In another incident that highlighted Marshall&#x27;s reputation for integrity, when President Franklin Roosevelt, a former Assistant Secretary of the Navy, favored the Navy during World War II planning, Marshall suggested that Roosevelt stop referring to the Navy as &quot;us&quot; and the Army as &quot;them.&quot; Roosevelt laughed, but Marshall&#x27;s humorous protest had made its point.

In addition to his military success, Marshall is primarily remembered as the driving force behind the Marshall Plan, which provided billions of dollars in aid to post war Europe to restart the economies of the destroyed countries. In recent years, the cooperation required between former European adversaries as part of the Marshall Plan has been recognized as one of the earliest factors that led to European integration beginning with the formation of the European Coal and Steel Community, and eventually the formation of the European Union.

In a television interview after leaving office, Truman was asked which American he thought had made the greatest contribution of the preceding thirty years. Without hesitation, Truman picked Marshall, adding &quot;I don&#x27;t think in this age in which I have lived, that there has been a man who has been a greater administrator; a man with a knowledge of military affairs equal to General Marshall.&quot;

Orson Welles said in a 1970 interview with Dick Cavett that &quot;Marshall is the greatest man I ever met ... I think he was the greatest human being who was also a great man ... He was a tremendous gentleman: an old fashioned institution which isn&#x27;t with us anymore.&quot; The story Welles related to Cavett to illustrate his point was about a time he saw Marshall take the time to speak with a young American soldier who had accidentally entered the same room. The young man was starstruck to have accidentally stumbled upon Marshall, yet Marshall still patiently and politely engaged the soldier in conversation.

===Tributes and memorials===
Two non-profit organizations, the George C. Marshall Foundation and the George C. Marshall International Center, actively propagate General Marshall&#x27;s legacy. The Marshall Foundation oversees Marshall&#x27;s official papers and over two million other documents relating to the 20th century. The International Center preserves Marshall&#x27;s home, Dodona Manor, as a museum and hosts educational programs focusing on Marshall&#x27;s life, leadership, and role in American history.

Numerous streets are named for General Marshall, including George-Marshall-Straße in Wiesbaden, Germany and George-C.-Marshall-Ring in Oberursel, Germany.

On 30 April 1998, the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies unveiled the first public statue of General Marshall in Europe in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. The slightly larger-than-life statue was sponsored by the Marshall Center, the Friends of the Marshall Center and the City of Garmisch-Partenkirchen. It shows Marshall in uniform walking across a bronze bridge, facing east, to greet new friends and allies and was designed by artist Christiane Horn of Wartenberg, Bavaria. Vernon A. Walters, former U.S. ambassador to Germany, was a keynote speaker during the dedication ceremony.

<text>An embryo is the initial stage of development for a multicellular organism. In organisms that reproduce sexually, embryonic development is the part of the life cycle that begins just after fertilization of the female egg cell by the male sperm cell. The resulting fusion of these two cells produces a single-celled zygote that undergoes many cell divisions that produce cells known as blastomeres. The blastomeres (4-cell stage) are arranged as a solid ball that when reaching a certain size, called a morula, (16-cell stage) takes in fluid to create a cavity called a blastocoel. The structure is then termed a blastula, or a blastocyst in mammals.

The mammalian blastocyst hatches before implantating into the endometrial lining of the womb. Once implanted the embryo will continue its development through the next stages of gastrulation, neurulation, and organogenesis. Gastrulation is the formation of the three germ layers that will form all of the different parts of the body. Neurulation forms the nervous system, and organogenesis is the development of all the various tissues and organs of the body.

A newly developing human is typically referred to as an embryo until the ninth week after conception, when it is then referred to as a fetus. In other multicellular organisms, the word &quot;embryo&quot; can be used more broadly to any early developmental or life cycle stage prior to birth or hatching.

==Etymology==
First attested in English in the mid-14c., the word &quot;embryon&quot; derives from Medieval Latin &quot;embryo&quot;, itself from Greek (&quot;embruon&quot;), lit. &quot;young one&quot;, which is the neuter of (&quot;embruos&quot;), lit. &quot;growing in&quot;, from ἐν (&quot;en&quot;), &quot;in&quot; and βρύω (&quot;bruō&quot;), &quot;swell, be full&quot;; the proper Latinized form of the Greek term would be &quot;embryum&quot;.

==Development==
===Animal embryos===

In animals, fertilization begins the process of embryonic development with the creation of a zygote, a single cell resulting from the fusion of gametes (e.g. egg and sperm). The development of a zygote into a multicellular embryo proceeds through a series of recognizable stages, often divided into cleavage, blastula, gastrulation, and organogenesis.

Cleavage is the period of rapid mitotic cell divisions that occur after fertilization. During cleavage, the overall size of the embryo does not change, but the size of individual cells decrease rapidly as they divide to increase the total number of cells. Cleavage results in a blastula.

Depending on the species, a blastula or blastocyst stage embryo can appear as a ball of cells on top of yolk, or as a hollow sphere of cells surrounding a middle cavity. The embryo&#x27;s cells continue to divide and increase in number, while molecules within the cells such as RNAs and proteins actively promote key developmental processes such as gene expression, cell fate specification, and polarity. Before implanting into the uterine wall the embryo is sometimes known as the &quot;pre-implantation embryo&quot; or &quot;pre-implantation conceptus&quot;. Sometimes this is called the pre-embryo a term employed to differentiate from an embryo proper in relation to embryonic stem cell discourses.

Gastrulation is the next phase of embryonic development, and involves the development of two or more layers of cells (germinal layers). Animals that form two layers (such as Cnidaria) are called diploblastic, and those that form three (most other animals, from flatworms to humans) are called triploblastic. During gastrulation of triploblastic animals, the three germinal layers that form are called the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. All tissues and organs of a mature animal can trace their origin back to one of these layers. For example, the ectoderm will give rise to the skin epidermis and the nervous system, the mesoderm will give rise to the vascular system, muscles, bone, and connective tissues, and the endoderm will give rise to organs of the digestive system and epithelium of the digestive system and respiratory system. Many visible changes in embryonic structure happen throughout gastrulation as the cells that make up the different germ layers migrate and cause the previously round embryo to fold or invaginate into a cup-like appearance.

Past gastrulation, an embryo continues to develop into a mature multicellular organism by forming structures necessary for life outside of the womb or egg. As the name suggests, organogenesis is the stage of embryonic development when organs form. During organogenesis, molecular and cellular interactions prompt certain populations of cells from the different germ layers to differentiate into organ-specific cell types. For example, in neurogenesis, a subpopulation of cells from the ectoderm segregate from other cells and further specialize to become the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nerves.

The embryonic period varies from species to species. In human development, the term fetus is used instead of embryo after the ninth week after conception, whereas in zebrafish, embryonic development is considered finished when a bone called the cleithrum becomes visible. In animals that hatch from an egg, such as birds, a young animal is typically no longer referred to as an embryo once it has hatched. In viviparous animals (animals whose offspring spend at least some time developing within a parent&#x27;s body), the offspring is typically referred to as an embryo while inside of the parent, and is no longer considered an embryo after birth or exit from the parent. However, the extent of development and growth accomplished while inside of an egg or parent varies significantly from species to species, so much so that the processes that take place after hatching or birth in one species may take place well before those events in another. Therefore, according to one textbook, it is common for scientists to interpret the scope of embryology broadly as the study of the development of animals.

===Plant embryos===

Flowering plants (angiosperms) create embryos after the fertilization of a haploid ovule by pollen. The DNA from the ovule and pollen combine to form a diploid, single-cell zygote that will develop into an embryo. The zygote, which will divide multiple times as it progresses throughout embryonic development, is one part of a seed. Other seed components include the endosperm, which is tissue rich in nutrients that will help support the growing plant embryo, and the seed coat, which is a protective outer covering. The first cell division of a zygote is asymmetric, resulting in an embryo with one small cell (the apical cell) and one large cell (the basal cell). The small, apical cell will eventually give rise to most of the structures of the mature plant, such as the stem, leaves, and roots. The larger basal cell will give rise to the suspensor, which connects the embryo to the endosperm so that nutrients can pass between them. The plant embryo cells continue to divide and progress through developmental stages named for their general appearance: globular, heart, and torpedo. In the globular stage, three basic tissue types (dermal, ground, and vascular) can be recognized. The dermal tissue will give rise to the epidermis or outer covering of a plant, ground tissue will give rise to inner plant material that functions in photosynthesis, resource storage, and physical support, and vascular tissue will give rise to connective tissue like the xylem and phloem that transport fluid, nutrients, and minerals throughout the plant. In heart stage, one or two cotyledons (embryonic leaves) will form. Meristems (centers of stem cell activity) develop during the torpedo stage, and will eventually produce many of the mature tissues of the adult plant throughout its life. At the end of embryonic growth, the seed will usually go dormant until germination. Once the embryo begins to germinate (grow out from the seed) and forms its first true leaf, it is called a seedling or plantlet.

Plants that produce spores instead of seeds, like bryophytes and ferns, also produce embryos. In these plants, the embryo begins its existence attached to the inside of the archegonium on a parental gametophyte from which the egg cell was generated. The inner wall of the archegonium lies in close contact with the &quot;foot&quot; of the developing embryo; this &quot;foot&quot; consists of a bulbous mass of cells at the base of the embryo which may receive nutrition from its parent gametophyte. The structure and development of the rest of the embryo varies by group of plants.

Since all land plants create embryos, they are collectively referred to as embryophytes (or by their scientific name, Embryophyta). This, along with other characteristics, distinguishes land plants from other types of plants, such as algae, which do not produce embryos.

==Research and technology==

=== Biological processes ===
Embryos from numerous plant and animal species are studied in biological research laboratories across the world to learn about topics such as stem cells, evolution and development, cell division, and gene expression. Examples of scientific discoveries made while studying embryos that were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine include the Spemann-Mangold organizer, a group of cells originally discovered in amphibian embryos that give rise to neural tissues, and genes that give rise to body segments discovered in &quot;Drosophila&quot; fly embryos by Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus.

=== Assisted reproductive technology ===
Creating and/or manipulating embryos via assisted reproductive technology (ART) is used for addressing fertility concerns in humans and other animals, and for selective breeding in agricultural species. Between the years 1987 and 2015, ART techniques including in vitro fertilization (IVF) were responsible for an estimated one million human births in the United States alone. Other clinical technologies include preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), which can identify certain serious genetic abnormalities, such as aneuploidy, prior to selecting embryos for use in IVF. Some have proposed (or even attempted - see He Jiankui affair) genetic editing of human embryos via CRISPR-Cas9 as a potential avenue for preventing disease; however, this has been met with widespread condemnation from the scientific community.

ART techniques are also used to improve the profitability of agricultural animal species such as cows and pigs by enabling selective breeding for desired traits and/or to increase numbers of offspring. For example, when allowed to breed naturally, cows typically produce one calf per year, whereas IVF increases offspring yield to 9–12 calves per year. IVF and other ART techniques, including cloning via interspecies somatic cell nuclear transfer (iSCNT), are also used in attempts to increase the numbers of endangered or vulnerable species, such as Northern white rhinos, cheetahs, and sturgeons.

=== Cryoconservation of plant and animal biodiversity ===
Cryoconservation of genetic resources involves collecting and storing the reproductive materials, such as embryos, seeds, or gametes, from animal or plant species at low temperatures in order to preserve them for future use. Some large-scale animal species cryoconservation efforts include &quot;frozen zoos&quot; in various places around the world, including in the UK&#x27;s Frozen Ark, the Breeding Centre for Endangered Arabian Wildlife (BCEAW) in the United Arab Emirates, and the San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation in the United States. As of 2018, there were approximately 1,700 seed banks used to store and protect plant biodiversity, particularly in the event of mass extinction or other global emergencies. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Norway maintains the largest collection of plant reproductive tissue, with more than a million samples stored at .

==Fossilized embryos==
Fossilized animal embryos are known from the Precambrian, and are found in great numbers during the Cambrian period. Even fossilized dinosaur embryos have been discovered.

<text>Medina, officially Al-Madinah al-Munawwarah (, ) and also commonly simplified as Madīnah or Madinah () and known in pre-Islamic times as Yathrib (), is the capital of Medina Province in the Hejaz region of western Saudi Arabia. It is one of the oldest and most important places in Islamic history. One of the most sacred cities in Islam, the population as of 2022 is 1,411,599, making it the fourth-most populous city in the country. Around 58.5% of the population are Saudi citizens and 41.5% are foreigners. Located at the core of the Medina Province in the western reaches of the country, the city is distributed over , of which constitutes the city&#x27;s urban area, while the rest is occupied by the Hejaz Mountains, empty valleys, agricultural spaces and older dormant volcanoes.

Medina is generally considered to be the &quot;cradle of Islamic culture and civilization&quot;. The city is considered to be the second-holiest of three key cities in Islamic tradition, with Mecca and Jerusalem serving as the holiest and third-holiest cities respectively. &quot;Al-Masjid al-Nabawi&quot; () is of exceptional importance in Islam and serves as burial site of the prophet Muhammad, by whom the mosque was built in 622 CE (first year of the Hijrah). Observant Muslims usually visit his tomb, or &quot;rawdhah&quot;, at least once in their lifetime during a pilgrimage known as Ziyarat, although this is not obligatory. The original name of the city before the advent of Islam was Yathrib (), and it is referred to by this name in Chapter 33 (&quot;Al-Aḥzāb&quot;, ) of the Quran. It was renamed to &#x27; () after and later to&#x27; () before being simplified and shortened to its modern name, &#x27; (), from which the [[English language|English-language]] spelling of &quot;Medina&quot; is derived. Saudi road signage uses&#x27; and &quot;&quot; interchangeably.

The city existed for over 1,500 years before Muhammad&#x27;s migration from Mecca, known as the Hijrah. Medina was the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim caliphate under Muhammad&#x27;s leadership, serving as its base of operations and as the cradle of Islam, where Muhammad&#x27;s &quot;ummah&quot; ()—composed of Medinan citizens (&quot;Ansar&quot;) as well as those who immigrated with Muhammad (&quot;Muhajirun&quot;), who were collectively known as the &quot;Sahabah&quot;—gained huge influence. Medina is home to three prominent mosques, namely al-Masjid an-Nabawi, Quba Mosque, and Masjid al-Qiblatayn, with the Quba Mosque being the oldest in Islam. A larger portion of the Qur&#x27;an was revealed in Medina in contrast to the earlier Meccan surahs.

Much like most of the Hejaz, Medina has seen numerous exchanges of power within its comparatively short existence. The region has been controlled by Jewish-Arabian tribes (up until the fifth century CE), the ʽAws and Khazraj (up until Muhammad&#x27;s arrival), Muhammad and the Rashidun (622–660), the Umayyads (660–749), the Abbasids (749–1254), the Mamluks of Egypt (1254–1517), the Ottomans (1517–1805), the First Saudi State (1805–1811), Muhammad Ali of Egypt (1811–1840), the Ottomans for a second time (1840–1918), the Sharifate of Mecca under the Hashemites (1918–1925) and finally is in the hands of the present-day Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (1925–present).

In addition to visiting for Ziyarah, tourists come to visit the other prominent mosques and landmarks in the city that hold religious significance such as Mount Uhud, Al-Baqi&#x27; cemetery and the Seven Mosques among others. The Saudi government has also carried out the destruction of several historical structures and archaeological sites, both in Medina and Mecca.

==Names==
===Yathrib===
Before the advent of Islam, the city was known as Yathrib (; ). The word &quot;Yathrib&quot; appears in an inscription found in Harran, belonging to the Babylonian king Nabonidus (6th century BCE) and is well attested in several texts in the subsequent centuries. The name has also been recorded in Āyah (verse) 13 of Surah (chapter) 33 of the Qur&#x27;an. and is thus known to have been the name of the city up to the Battle of the Trench. According to Islamic tradition, Muhammad later forbade calling the city by this name.

===Taybah and Tabah===

Sometime after the battle, Muhammad renamed the city &quot;Taybah&quot; (the Kind or the Good) (; ) and &quot;Tabah&quot; () which is of similar meaning. This name is also used to refer to the city in the popular folk song, &quot;Ya Taybah!&quot; (O Taybah!). The two names are combined in another name the city is known by, &quot;Taybat at-Tabah&quot; (the Kindest of the Kind).

===Madinah===
The city has also simply been called Al-Madinah (i.e. &#x27;The City&#x27;) in some &quot;ahadith&quot;&quot;.&quot; The names &quot;&quot; () and &quot;Madīnat un-Nabī&quot; (both meaning &quot;City of the Prophet&quot; or &quot;The Prophet&#x27;s City&quot;) and &quot;al-Madīnat ul-Munawwarah&quot; (&quot;The Enlightened City&quot;) are all derivatives of this word. This is also the most commonly accepted modern name of the city, used in official documents and road signage, along with Madinah.

==History==
Medina is home to several distinguished sites and landmarks, most of which are mosques and hold historic significance. These include the three aforementioned mosques, Masjid al-Fath (also known as Masjid al-Khandaq), the Seven Mosques, the Baqi&#x27; Cemetery where the graves of many famous Islamic figures are presumed to be located; directly to the southeast of the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque, the Uhud mountain, site of the eponymous Battle of Uhud and the King Fahd Glorious Qur&#x27;an Printing Complex where most modern Qur&#x27;anic Mus&#x27;hafs are printed.

===Early history and Jewish control===
Medina has been inhabited at least 1500 years before the Hijra, or approximately the 9th century BCE. By the fourth century, Arab tribes began to encroach from Yemen, and there were three prominent Jewish tribes that inhabited the city around the time of Muhammad: the Banu Qaynuqa, the Banu Qurayza, and Banu Nadir. Ibn Khordadbeh later reported that during the Persian Empire&#x27;s domination in Hejaz, the Banu Qurayza served as tax collectors for the Persian Shah.

The situation changed after the arrival of two new Arab tribes, the &#x27;Aws or Banu &#x27;Aws and the Khazraj, also known as the Banu Khazraj. At first, these tribes were allied with the Jewish tribes who ruled the region, but they later revolted and became independent.
===Under the &#x27;Aws and Khazraj===
Toward the end of the 5th century, the Jewish rulers lost control of the city to the two Arab tribes. 

Most modern historians accept the claim of the Muslim sources that after the revolt, the Jewish tribes became clients of the &#x27;Aws and the Khazraj. However, according to Scottish scholar, William Montgomery Watt, the clientship of the Jewish tribes is not borne out by the historical accounts of the period prior to 627, and he maintained that the Jewish populace retained a measure of political independence.

Early Muslim chronicler Ibn Ishaq tells of an ancient conflict between the last Yemenite king of the Himyarite Kingdom and the residents of Yathrib. When the king was passing by the oasis, the residents killed his son, and the Yemenite ruler threatened to exterminate the people and cut down the palms. According to Ibn Ishaq, he was stopped from doing so by two rabbis from the Banu Qurayza tribe, who implored the king to spare the oasis because it was the place &quot;to which a prophet of the Quraysh would migrate in time to come, and it would be his home and resting-place.&quot; The Yemenite king thus did not destroy the town and converted to Judaism. He took the rabbis with him, and in Mecca, they reportedly recognized the Ka&#x27;bah as a temple built by Abraham and advised the king &quot;to do what the people of Mecca did: to circumambulate the temple, to venerate and honor it, to shave his head and to behave with all humility until he had left its precincts.&quot; On approaching Yemen, tells Ibn Ishaq, the rabbis demonstrated to the local people a miracle by coming out of a fire unscathed and the Yemenites accepted Judaism.

Eventually the Banu &#x27;Aws and the Banu Khazraj became hostile to each other and by the time of Muhammad&#x27;s Hijrah (emigration) to Medina in 622, they had been fighting for 120 years and were sworn enemies The Banu Nadir and the Banu Qurayza were allied with the &#x27;Aws, while the Banu Qaynuqa sided with the Khazraj. They fought a total of four wars.

Their last and bloodiest known battle was the Battle of Bu&#x27;ath, fought a few years prior to the arrival of Muhammad. The outcome of the battle was inconclusive, and the feud continued. &#x27;Abd Allah ibn Ubayy, one Khazraj chief, had refused to take part in the battle, which earned him a reputation for equity and peacefulness. He was the most respected inhabitant of the city prior to Muhammad&#x27;s arrival. To solve the ongoing feud, concerned residents of Yathrib met secretly with Muhammad in &#x27;Aqaba, a place outside Mecca, inviting him and his small group of believers to come to the city, where Muhammad could serve a mediator between the factions and his community could practice its faith freely.

===Under Muhammad and the Rashidun===
In 622, Muhammad and an estimated 70 Meccan Muhajirun left Mecca over a period of a few months for sanctuary in Yathrib, an event that transformed the religious and political landscape of the city completely; the longstanding enmity between the Aus and Khazraj tribes was dampened as many of the two Arab tribes and some local Jews embraced the new religion of Islam. Muhammad, linked to the Khazraj through his great-grandmother, was agreed on as the leader of the city. The natives of Yathrib who had converted to Islam of any background—pagan Arab or Jewish—were called the &quot;Ansar&quot; (&quot;the Patrons&quot; or &quot;the Helpers&quot;).

According to Ibn Ishaq, all parties in the area agreed to the Constitution of Medina, which committed all parties to mutual cooperation under the leadership of Muhammad. The nature of this document as recorded by Ibn Ishaq and transmitted by Ibn Hisham is the subject of dispute among modern Western historians, many of whom maintain that this &quot;treaty&quot; is possibly a collage of different agreements, oral rather than written, of different dates, and that it is not clear exactly when they were made. Other scholars, however, both Western and Muslim, argue that the text of the agreement—whether a single document originally or several—is possibly one of the oldest Islamic texts we possess. In Yemenite Jewish sources, another treaty was drafted between Muhammad and his Jewish subjects, known as &quot;Kitāb Dimmat al-Nabi&quot;, written in the 3rd year of the Hijra (625), and which gave express liberty to Jews living in Arabia to observe the Sabbath and to grow-out their side-locks. In return, they were to pay the jizya annually for protection by their patrons, while the Muslims would pay the Zakat tax.

====Battle of Uhud====

In the year 625, Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, a senior chieftain of Mecca who later converted to Islam, led a Meccan force against Medina. Muhammad marched out to meet the Qurayshi army with an estimated 1,000 troops, but just as the army approached the battlefield, 300 men under &#x27;Abd Allah ibn Ubayy withdrew, dealing a severe blow to the Muslim army&#x27;s morale. Muhammad continued marching with his now 700-strong force and ordered a group of 50 archers to climb a small hill, now called &quot;Jabal ar-Rummaah&quot; (The Archers&#x27; Hill) to keep an eye on the Meccan&#x27;s cavalry and to provide protection to the rear of the Muslim&#x27;s army. As the battle heated up, the Meccans were forced to retreat. The frontline was pushed further and further away from the archers and foreseeing the battle to be a victory for the Muslims, the archers decided to leave their posts to pursue the retreating Meccans. A small party, however, stayed behind; pleading the rest to not disobey Muhammad&#x27;s orders.

Seeing that the archers were starting to descend from the hill, Khalid ibn al-Walid commanded his unit to ambush the hill and his cavalry unit pursued the descending archers were systematically slain by being caught in the plain ahead of the hill and the frontline, watched upon by their desperate comrades who stayed behind up in the hill who were shooting arrows to thwart the raiders, but with little to no effect. However, the Meccans did not capitalize on their advantage by invading Medina and returned to Mecca. The Madanis (people of Medina) suffered heavy losses, and Muhammad was injured.

====Battle of the Trench====
In 627, Abu Sufyan led another force toward Medina. Knowing of his intentions, Muhammad asked for proposals for defending the northern flank of the city, as the east and west were protected by volcanic rocks and the south was covered with palm trees. Salman al-Farsi, a Persian Sahabi who was familiar with Sasanian war tactics recommended digging a trench to protect the city and Muhammad accepted it. The subsequent siege came to be known as the Battle of the Trench and the Battle of the Confederates. After a month-long siege and various skirmishes, the Meccans withdrew again due to the harsh winter.

During the siege, Abu Sufyan contacted the Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza and formed an agreement with them, to attack the Muslim defenders and effectively encircle the defenders. It was however discovered by the Muslims and thwarted. This was in breach of the Constitution of Medina and after the Meccan withdrawal, Muhammad immediately marched against the Qurayza and laid siege to their strongholds. The Jewish forces eventually surrendered. Some members of the Aws negotiated on behalf of their old allies and Muhammad agreed to appoint one of their chiefs who had converted to Islam, Sa&#x27;d ibn Mu&#x27;adh, as judge. Sa&#x27;ad judged that all male members of the tribe should be killed and the women and children enslaved. This action was conceived of as a defensive measure to ensure that the Muslim community could be confident of its continued survival in Medina. The French historian Robert Mantran proposes that from this point of view it was successful—from this point on, the Muslims were no longer primarily concerned with survival but with expansion and conquest.

In the ten years following the hijra, Medina formed the base from which Muhammad and the Muslim army attacked and were attacked, and it was from here that he marched on Mecca, entering it without battle in 630. Despite Muhammad&#x27;s tribal connection to Mecca, the growing importance of Mecca in Islam, the significance of the Ka&#x27;bah as the center of the Islamic world, as the direction of prayer (Qibla), and in the Islamic pilgrimage (Hajj), Muhammad returned to Medina, which remained for some years the most important city of Islam and the base of operations of the early Rashidun Caliphate.

The city is presumed to have been renamed &quot;Madinat al-Nabi&quot; (&quot;City of the Prophet&quot; in Arabic) in honor of Muhammad&#x27;s prophethood and the city being the site of his burial. Alternatively, Lucien Gubbay suggests the name Medina could also have been a derivative from the Aramaic word &quot;Medinta&quot;, which the Jewish inhabitants could have used for the city.

Under the first three caliphs Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman, Medina was the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim Empire. During the reign of &#x27;Uthman ibn al-Affan, the third caliph, a party of Arabs from Egypt, disgruntled at some of his political decisions, attacked Medina in 656 and assassinated him in his own home. Ali, the fourth caliph, changed the capital of the caliphate from Medina to Kufa in Iraq for being in a more strategic location. Since then, Medina&#x27;s importance dwindled, becoming more a place of religious importance than of political power. Medina witnessed little to no economic growth during and after Ali&#x27;s reign. 

===Under subsequent Islamic regimes===

====Umayyad Caliphate====
After al-Hasan, the son of &#x27;Ali, ceded power to Mu&#x27;awiyah I, son of Abu Sufyan, Mu&#x27;awiyah marched into Kufa, Ali&#x27;s capital, and received the allegiance of the local &#x27;Iraqis. This is considered to be the beginning of the Umayyad caliphate. Mu&#x27;awiyah&#x27;s governors took special care of Medina and dug the &#x27;Ayn az-Zarqa&#x27;a (&quot;Blue Spring&quot;) spring along with a project that included the creation of underground ducts for the purposes of irrigation. Dams were built in some of the wadis and the subsequent agricultural boom led to the strengthening of the economy.

Following a period of unrest during the Second Fitna in 679, Husayn ibn &#x27;Ali was martyred at Karbala and Yazid assumed unchecked control for the next three years. In 682, Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr declared himself Caliph of Mecca and the people of Medina swore allegiance to him. This led to an eight-year-long period of economic distress for the city. In 692, the Umayyads regained power and Medina experienced its second period of huge economic growth. Trade improved and more people moved into the city. The banks of Wadi al-&#x27;Aqiq were now lush with greenery. This period of peace and prosperity coincided with the rule of &#x27;Umar ibn Abdulaziz, who many consider to be the fifth of the Rashidun.

====Abbasid Caliphate====
Abdulbasit A. Badr, in his book, &quot;Madinah, The Enlightened City: History and Landmarks&quot;, divides this period into three distinct phases:
Badr describes the period between 749 and 974 as a push-and-pull between peace and political turmoil, while Medina continued to pay allegiance to the Abbasids. From 974 to 1151, the Sharifate of Medina was in a liaison with the Fatimids, even though the political stand between the two remained turbulent and did not exceed the normal allegiance. From 1151 onwards, Medina paid allegiance to the Zengids, and the Emir Nuruddin Zengi took care of the roads used by pilgrims and funded the fixing of the water sources and streets. When he visited Medina in 1162, he ordered the construction of a new wall that encompassed the new urban areas outside the old city wall. Zengi was succeeded by Saladin, founder of the Ayyubid dynasty, who supported Qasim ibn Muhanna, the Sharif of Medina, and greatly funded the growth of the city while slashing taxes paid by the pilgrims. He also funded the Bedouins who lived on the routes used by pilgrims to protect them on their journeys. The later Abbasids also continued to fund the expenses of the city. While Medina was formally allied with the Abbasids during this period, they maintained closer relations with the Zengids and Ayyubids. The historic city formed an oval, surrounded by a strong wall, high, dating from this period, and was flanked with towers. Of its four gates, the &quot;Bab al-Salam&quot; (&quot;The Gate of Peace&quot;), was remarked for its beauty. Beyond the walls of the city, the west and south were suburbs consisting of low houses, yards, gardens and plantations.

====Mamluk Sultanate of Cairo====
After the fall of Baghdad, the capital of the Abbasid Empire, to the Mongols, the Mamluk Sultanate of Cairo took over the Egyptian governorate and effectively gained control of Medina. In 1258, Medina was threatened by lava from the Harrat Rahat volcanic region but was narrowly saved from being burnt after the lava turned northward. During Mamluk reign, the Masjid an-Nabawi caught fire twice. Once in 1256, when the storage caught fire, burning the entire mosque, and the other time in 1481, when the masjid was struck by lightning. This period also coincided with an increase in scholarly activity in Medina, with scholars such as Ibn Farhun, Al-Hafiz Zain al-Din al-&#x27;Iraqi, Al Sakhawi and others settling in the city. The striking iconic Green Dome also found its beginnings as a cupola built under Mamluk Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun as-Salihi in 1297.

===Ottoman rule===

====First Ottoman period====
In 1517, the first Ottoman period began with Selim I&#x27;s conquest of Mamluk Egypt. This added Medina to their territory and they continued the tradition of showering Medina with money and aid. In 1532, Suleiman the Magnificent built a secure fortress around the city and constructed a strong castle armed by an Ottoman battalion to protect the city. This is also the period in which many of the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque&#x27;s modern features were built even though it was not painted green yet. These suburbs also had walls and gates. The Ottoman sultans took a keen interest in the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque and redesigned it over and over to suit their preferences.
====First Saudi insurgency====
As the Ottomans&#x27; hold over their domains broke loose, the Madanis pledged alliance to Saud bin Abdulaziz, founder of the First Saudi state in 1805, who quickly took over the city. In 1811, Muhammad Ali of Egypt, Ottoman commander and Wali of Egypt, commanded two armies under each of his two sons to seize Medina, the first one, under the elder Towson Pasha, failed to take Medina. But the second one, a larger army under the command of Ibrahim Pasha, succeeded after battling a fierce resistance movement.

====Muhammad Ali&#x27;s era====
After defeating his Saudi foes, Muhammad Ali took over governance of Medina and although he did not formally declare independence, his governance took on more of a semi-autonomous style. Muhammad&#x27;s sons, Towson and Ibrahim, alternated in the governance of the city. Ibrahim renovated the city&#x27;s walls and the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque. He established a grand provision distribution center (taqiyya) to distribute food and alms to the needy and Medina lived a period of security and peace. In 1840, Muhammad moved his troops out of the city and officially handed the city to the central Ottoman command.

====Second Ottoman period====

Four years in 1844, after Muhammad Ali&#x27;s departure, Davud Pasha was given the position of governor of Medina under the Ottoman sultan. Davud was responsible for renovating the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque on Sultan Abdulmejid I&#x27;s orders. When Abdul Hamid II assumed power, he made Medina stand out of the desert with a number of modern marvels, including a radio communication station, a power plant for the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque and its immediate vicinity, a telegraph line between Medina and Constantinople, and the Hejaz railway which ran from Damascus to Medina with a planned extension to Mecca. Within one decade, the population of the city multiplied by leaps and bounds and reached 80,000. Around this time, Medina started falling prey to a new threat, the Hashemite Sharifate of Mecca in the south. Medina witnessed the longest siege in its history during and after World War I.

===Modern history===

====Sharifate of Mecca and Saudi conquest====
The Sharif of Mecca, Husayn ibn Ali, first attacked Medina on 6 June 1916, in the middle of World War I. Four days later, Husayn held Medina in a bitter 3-year siege, during which the people faced food shortages, widespread disease and mass emigration. Fakhri Pasha, governor of Medina, tenaciously held on during the Siege of Medina from 10 June 1916 and refused to surrender and held on another 72 days after the Armistice of Moudros, until he was arrested by his own men and the city was taken over by the Sharifate on 10 January 1919. Husayn largely won the war due to his alliance with the British. In anticipation of the plunder and destruction to follow, Fakhri Pasha secretly dispatched the Sacred Relics of Muhammad to the Ottoman capital, Istanbul. As of 1920, the British described Medina as &quot;much more self-supporting than Mecca.&quot; After the Great War, the Sharif of Mecca, Sayyid Hussein bin Ali was proclaimed King of an independent Hejaz. Soon after, the people of Medina secretly entered an agreement with Ibn Saud in 1924, and his son, Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz conquered Medina as part of the Saudi conquest of Hejaz on 5 December 1925 which gave way to the whole of the Hejaz being incorporated into the modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

====Under the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia====
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia focused more on the expansion of the city and the demolition of former sites that according to them violated Islamic principles and Islamic law such as the tombs at al-Baqi. Nowadays, the city mostly only holds religious significance and as such, just like Mecca, has given rise to a number of hotels surrounding the Al-Masjid an-Nabawi, which unlike the Masjid Al-Ḥarām, is equipped with an underground parking. The old city&#x27;s walls have been destroyed and replaced with the three ring roads that encircle Medina today, named in order of length, King Faisal Road, King Abdullah Road and King Khalid Road. Medina&#x27;s ring roads generally see less traffic overall compared to the four ring roads of Mecca.

An international airport, named the Prince Mohammed Bin Abdulaziz International Airport, now serves the city and is located on Highway 340, known locally as the Old Qassim Road. The city now sits at the crossroads of two major Saudi Arabian highways, Highway 60, known as the Qassim–Medina Highway, and Highway 15 which connects the city to Mecca in the south and onward and Tabuk in the north and onward, known as the Al Hijrah Highway or Al Hijrah Road, after Muhammad&#x27;s journey. The old Ottoman railway system was shut down after their departure from the region and the old railway station has now been converted into a museum. The city has recently seen another connection and mode of transport between it and Mecca, the Haramain high-speed railway line connects the two cities via King Abdullah Economic City near Rabigh, King Abdulaziz International Airport and the city of Jeddah in under 3 hours.

Though the city&#x27;s sacred core of the old city is off limits to non-Muslims, the Haram area of Medina itself is much smaller than that of Mecca and Medina has recently seen an increase in the number of Muslim and Non-Muslim expatriate workers of other nationalities, most commonly South Asian peoples and people from other countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council. Almost all of the historic city has been demolished in the Saudi era. The rebuilt city is centered on the vastly expanded &quot;al-Masjid an-Nabawi&quot;.

====Destruction of heritage in Medina====

Saudi Arabia upholds Wahhabism as its religious ideology, which is hostile to any reverence given to historical or religious places of significance for fear that it may give rise to &quot;shirk&quot; (idolatry). As a consequence, under Saudi rule, Medina has suffered from considerable destruction of its physical heritage including the loss of many buildings over a thousand years old. Critics have described this as &quot;Saudi vandalism&quot; and claim that 300 historic sites linked to Muhammad, his family or companions have been lost in Medina and Mecca over the last 50 years. The most famous example of this is the demolition of al-Baqi. 

==Geography==

Medina is located in the Hejaz region which is a wide strip between the Nafud desert and the Red Sea. Located approximately northwest of Riyadh which is at the center of the Saudi desert, the city is away from the west coast of Saudi Arabia and at an elevation of approximately above sea level. It lies at 39º36&#x27; longitude east and 24º28&#x27; latitude north. It covers an area of about . The city has been divided into twelve districts, 7 of which have been categorized as urban districts, while the other 5 have been categorized as suburban.

===Elevation===
Like most cities in the Hejaz region, Medina is situated at a relatively high elevation. Almost two times as high as Mecca, the city is situated at above sea level. Mount Uhud is the highest peak in Medina and is tall.

===Topography===
Medina is a desert oasis surrounded by the Hejaz Mountains and volcanic hills. The soil surrounding Medina consists of mostly basalt, while the hills, especially noticeable to the south of the city, are volcanic ash which dates to the first geological period of the Paleozoic Era. It is surrounded by a number of famous mountains, most notably &quot;Jabal Al-Hujjaj&quot; (The Pilgrims&#x27; Mountain) to the west, Sal&#x27;aa Mountain to the north-west, &quot;Jabal al-&#x27;Ir&quot; or Caravan Mountain to the south and Mount Uhud to the north. The city is situated on a flat mountain plateau at the tripoint of the three valleys (wadis) of &quot;Wadi al &#x27;Aql&quot;, &quot;Wadi al &#x27;Aqiq&quot;, and &quot;Wadi al Himdh&quot;, for this reason, there are large green areas amidst a dry deserted mountainous region.

===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Medina falls in a hot desert climate region (BWh). Summers are extremely hot and dry with daytime temperatures averaging about with nights about . Temperatures above are not unusual between June and September. Winters are milder, with temperatures from at night to in the day. There is very little rainfall, which falls almost entirely between November and May. In summer, the wind is north-western, while in the spring and winters, is south-western.

==Significance in Islam==

Medina&#x27;s importance as a religious site derives from the presence of two mosques, &quot;Masjid Quba&#x27;a&quot; and &quot;al-Masjid an-Nabawi&quot;. Both of these mosques were built by Muhammad himself. Islamic scriptures emphasize the sacredness of Medina. Medina is mentioned several times in the Quran; two examples are Surah At-Tawbah (verse 101) and Al-Hashr (verse 8). Medinan suras are typically longer than their Meccan counterparts and they are also larger in number. Muhammad al-Bukhari recorded in Sahih Bukhari that Anas ibn Malik quoted Muhammad as saying: &quot;Medina is a sanctuary from that place to that. Its trees should not be cut and no heresy should be innovated nor any sin should be committed in it, and whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits sins (bad deeds), then he will incur the curse of God, the angels, and all the people.&quot;

===The Prophet&#x27;s Mosque (al-Masjid an-Nabawi)===

According to Islamic tradition, a prayer in The Prophet&#x27;s Mosque equates to 1,000 prayers in any other mosque except the &quot;Masjid al-Haram&quot; where one prayer equates to 100,000 prayers in any other mosque. The mosque was initially just an open space for prayer with a raised and covered &quot;minbar&quot; (pulpit) built within seven months and was located beside Muhammad&#x27;s &quot;rawdhah&quot; (residence, although the word literally means garden) to its side along with the houses of his wives. The mosque was expanded several times throughout history, with many of its internal features developed over time to suit contemporary standards.

The modern Prophet&#x27;s Mosque is famed for the Green Dome situated directly above Muhammad&#x27;s &quot;rawdhah,&quot; which currently serves as the burial site for Muhammad, Abu Bakr al-Siddiq and Umar ibn al-Khattab and is used in road signage along with its signature minaret as an icon for Medina itself. The entire piazza of the mosque is shaded from the sun by 250 membrane umbrellas. 

===Quba&#x27;a Mosque===
It is Sunnah to perform prayer at the Quba&#x27;a Mosque. According to a &quot;hadith&quot;, Sahl ibn Hunayf reported that Muhammad said, &quot;Whoever purifies himself in his house, then comes to the mosque of Quba&#x27; and prays in it, he will have a reward like the Umrah pilgrimage.&quot;
and in another narration,&quot;Whoever goes out until he comes to this mosque – meaning the Mosque of Quba&#x27; – and prays there, that will be equivalent to &#x27;Umrah.&quot;It has been recorded by al-Bukhari and Muslim that Muhammad used to go to Quba&#x27;a every Saturday to offer two rak&#x27;ahs of Sunnah prayer. The mosque at Quba&#x27;a was built by Muhammad himself upon his arrival to the old city of Medina. Quba&#x27;a and the mosque has been referred in the Qur&#x27;an indirectly in Surah At-Tawbah, verse 108.

===Other sites===

====Masjid al-Qiblatayn====

&quot;Masjid al-Qiblatayn&quot; is another mosque historically important to Muslims. Muslims believe that Muhammad was commanded to change his direction of prayer (qibla) from praying toward Jerusalem to praying toward the Ka&#x27;bah at Mecca, as he was commanded in Surah Al-Baqarah, verses 143 and 144. The mosque is currently being expanded to be able to hold more than 4,000 worshippers.

====Masjid al-Fath and the Seven Mosques====

Three of these historic six mosques were combined recently into the larger Masjid al-Fath with an open courtyard. Sunni sources contend that there is no &quot;hadith&quot; or any other evidence to prove that Muhammad may have said something about the virtue of these mosques.

====Al-Baqi&#x27; Cemetery====
Al-Baqi&#x27; is a significant cemetery in Medina where several family members of Muhammad, caliphs and scholars are known to have been buried.

===In Islamic eschatology===
====End of civilization====
Concerning the end of civilization in Medina, Abu Hurairah is recorded to have said that Muhammad said:&quot;The people will leave Medina in spite of the best state it will have, and none except the wild birds and the beasts of prey will live in it, and the last persons who will die will be two shepherds from the tribe of Muzaina, who will be driving their sheep towards Medina, but will find nobody in it, and when they reach the valley of Thaniyat-al-Wada&#x27;h, they will fall down on their faces dead.&quot; (al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 30, Hadith 98)Sufyan ibn Abu Zuhair said Muhammad said:&quot;Yemen will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families, and those who will obey them to migrate (to Yemen) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. Sham will also be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them, to migrate (to Sham) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. &#x27;Iraq will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them to migrate (to &#x27;Iraq) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew.&quot; (al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 30, Hadith 99)

====Protection from plague and ad-Dajjal (the False Messiah)====

With regards to Medina&#x27;s protection from plague and ad-Dajjal, the following &quot;ahadith&quot; were recorded:

by Abu Bakra:&quot;The terror caused by &quot;Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal&quot; will not enter Medina and at that time Medina will have seven gates and there will be two angels at each gate guarding them.&quot; (al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 30, Hadith 103)by Abu Hurairah:&quot;There are angels guarding the entrances (or roads) of Medina, neither plague nor Ad-Dajjal will be able to enter it.&quot; (al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 30, Hadith 104)

==Demographics==

As of 2018, the recorded population of Medina province was 2,188,138, with a growth rate of 2.32%. Being a destination of Muslims from around the world, Medina witnesses illegal immigration after performing Hajj or Umrah, despite the strict rules the government has enforced. However, the Central Hajj Commissioner Prince Khalid bin Faisal stated that the numbers of illegal staying visitors dropped by 29% in 2018.

===Religion===
As with most cities in Saudi Arabia, Islam is the religion followed by the majority of the population of Medina.

Sunnis of different schools (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi&#x27;i and Hanbali) constitute the majority, while there is a significant Shia minority in and around Medina, such as the Nakhawila. Outside the haram, there are significant numbers of Non-Muslim migrant workers and expats.

==Culture==
Similar to that of Mecca, Medina exhibits a cross-cultural environment, a city where people of many nationalities and cultures live together and interact with each other on a daily basis. This only helps the King Fahd Complex for the Printing of the Holy Quran. Established in 1985, the biggest publisher of Quran in the world, it employs around 1100 people and publishes 361 different publications in many languages. It is reported that more than 400,000 people from around the world visit the complex every year. Every visitor is gifted a free copy of the Qur&#x27;an at the end of a tour of the facility.

The Al Madinah Museum has several exhibits concerning the cultural and historical heritage of the city featuring different archeological collections, visual galleries and rare images of the old city. It also includes the Hejaz Railway Museum. The Dar Al Madinah Museum opened in 2011 and it uncovers the history of Medina specializing in the architectural and urban heritage of the city. There is no archeology or architecture from the time of Mohammed, except what remains of a few stone defensive towers The Holy Qur&#x27;an Exhibition houses rare manuscripts of the Quran, along with other exhibitions that encircle the Masjid an-Nabawi.

The Dar al-Qalam Center for Arabic Calligraphy is located to the northwest of the Masjid an-Nabawi, just across the Hejaz Railway Museum. In April 2020, it was announced that the center was renamed the Prince Mohammed bin Salman Center for Arabic Calligraphy, and upgraded to an international hub for Arabic Calligraphers, in conjunction with the &quot;Year of Arabic Calligraphy&quot; event organized by the Ministry of Culture during the years 2020 and 2021.

Other projects launched by the MMDA Cultural Wing include the Madinah Forum of Live Sculpture held at Quba Square, with 16 sculptors from 11 countries. The forum aimed to celebrate sculpture as it is an ancient art, and to attract young artists to this form of art.

==Economy==
Historically, Medina&#x27;s economy was dependent on the sale of dates and other agricultural activities. As of 1920, 139 varieties of dates were being grown in the area, along with other vegetables. Religious tourism plays a major part in Medina&#x27;s economy, being the second holiest city in Islam, and holding many historical Islamic locations, it attracts more than 7 million annual visitors who come to perform Hajj during the Hajj season, and Umrah throughout the year.

Medina has two industrial areas, the larger one was established in 2003 with a total area of 10,000,000 m2, and managed by the Saudi Authority for Industrial Cities and Technology Zones (MODON). It is located from Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz International Airport, and from Yanbu Commercial Port, and has 236 factories, which produce petroleum products, building materials, food products, and many other products.

It handles domestic flights, while it has scheduled international services to regional destinations in the Middle East. It is the fourth-busiest airport in Saudi Arabia, handling 8,144,790 passengers in 2018.

In 2015, the MMDA announced Darb as-Sunnah (Sunnah Path) Project, which aims to develop and transform the Quba&#x27;a Road connecting the Quba&#x27;a Mosque to the al-Masjid an-Nabawi to an avenue, paving the whole road for pedestrians and providing service facilities to the visitors. The project also aims to revive the Sunnah where Muhammed used to walk from his house (al-Masjid an-Nabawi) to Quba&#x27;a every Saturday afternoon.

The city of Medina lies at the junction of two of the most important Saudi highways, Highway 60 and Highway 15. Highway 15 connects Medina to Mecca in the south and onward and Tabuk and Jordan in the north. Highway 60 connects the city with Yanbu, a port city on the Red Sea in the west and Al Qassim in the east. The city is served by three ring roads: King Faisal Road, a 5 km ring road that surrounds Al-Masjid an-Nabawi and the downtown area, King Abdullah Road, a 27 km road that surrounds most of urban Medina and King Khalid Road is the biggest ring road that surrounds the whole city and some rural areas with 60 km of roads.

<doc id="36637" wikidata="Q163" url="?curid=36637" title="Yorkshire">
<text>Yorkshire ( ) is an area of Northern England which was historically a county. Despite no longer being used for administration, Yorkshire retains a strong regional identity. The county was named after its county town, the city of York.

The south-west of Yorkshire is densely populated, and includes the cities of Leeds, Sheffield, Bradford, Doncaster and Wakefield. The north and east of the county are more sparsely populated, however the north-east includes the southern part of the Teesside conurbation, and the port city of Kingston upon Hull is located in the south-east. York is located near the centre of the county. Yorkshire has a coastline to the North Sea to the east. The North York Moors occupy the north-east of the county, and the centre contains the Vale of Mowbray in the north and the Vale of York in the south. The west contains part of the Pennines, which form the Yorkshire Dales in the north-west.

The county was historically bordered by County Durham to the north, the North Sea to the east, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, and Cheshire to the south, and Lancashire and Westmorland to the west. It was the largest by area in the United Kingdom. From the Middle Ages the county was subdivided into smaller administrative areas; the city of York was a self-governing county corporate from 1396, and the rest of the county was divided into three ridings – North, East, and West. From 1660 onwards each riding had its own lord-lieutenant, and between 1889 and 1974 the ridings were administrative counties. There was a Sheriff of Yorkshire until 1974. Yorkshire gives its name to four modern ceremonial counties: East Riding of Yorkshire, North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, and West Yorkshire, which together cover most of the historic county.

Yorkshire Day is observed annually on 1 August and is a celebration of the general culture of Yorkshire, including its history and dialect. Its name is used by several institutions, for example the Royal Yorkshire Regiment of the British Army, in sport, and in the media. The emblem of Yorkshire is a white rose, which was originally the heraldic badge of the British royal House of York. The county is sometimes referred to as &quot;God&#x27;s own country&quot;. Yorkshire is represented in sport by Yorkshire County Cricket Club and Yorkshire Rugby Football Union.

==Definitions==
There are several ways of defining Yorkshire, including the historic county and the group of four modern ceremonial counties. The county boundaries were reasonably stable between 1182, when it ceded western areas to the new county of Lancashire, and 1889 when administrative counties were created, which saw some adjustments to the boundaries with County Durham, Lancashire and Lincolnshire. After 1889 there were occasional adjustments to accommodate urban areas which were developing across county boundaries, such as in 1934 when Dore and Totley were transferred from Derbyshire to Yorkshire on being absorbed into the borough of Sheffield.

More significant changes in 1974 saw the historic county divided between several counties. The majority of the area was split between North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire, which all kept the Yorkshire name. A large part of the east of the county went to the new county of Humberside, and an area in the north-east went to the new county of Cleveland. Some more rural areas at the edges of the historic county were transferred to County Durham, Cumbria, Lancashire and Greater Manchester, whilst South Yorkshire also included areas which had been in Nottinghamshire.
Cleveland and Humberside were both abolished in 1996, since when there have been four ceremonial counties with Yorkshire in their names: East Riding of Yorkshire, North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire, which together cover most of the historic county.

There is a region called Yorkshire and the Humber which covers a similar area to the combined area of the four Yorkshire ceremonial counties, the exceptions being that the region excludes the parts of North Yorkshire which had been in Cleveland, but includes North East Lincolnshire and North Lincolnshire (which had been in Humberside). Until 2009 some government powers in the region were devolved to the Yorkshire and Humber Assembly; since 2009 the region has been used primarily for presentation of statistics.

==Etymology==
Yorkshire is so named as it is the shire (administrative area or county) of the city of York, or York&#x27;s Shire. The word &quot;York&quot; is believed to have originated from the Brittonic word &quot;Eburākon&quot;, which means &quot;place of yew trees&quot;. This theory is supported by the fact that yew trees were once abundant in the area around York, and that the city was known for its skilled bow makers who used yew wood to make their bows. This became &quot;Eboracum&quot; to the Romans, &quot;Eorfowic&quot; to the Angles and then, most famously, &quot;Jorvik&quot; to the Vikings. 

==History==
===Ancient–500: Hen Ogledd===
====Early: Celtic Brigantes and Parisi====

Early inhabitants of what became Yorkshire were Hen Ogledd Brythonic Celts (old north British Celts), who formed separate tribes, the Brigantes (known to be in the north and western areas of now Yorkshire) and the Parisi (present-day East Riding). The Brigantes controlled territory that later became all of Northern England and more territory than most Celtic tribes on the island of Great Britain. Six of the nine Brigantian &quot;poleis&quot; described by Claudius Ptolemaeus in the &quot;Geographia&quot; fall within the historic county.

The Parisi, who controlled the area that would become the East Riding, might have been related to the Parisii of &quot;Lutetia Parisiorum&quot;, Gaul (known today as Paris, France). Their capital was at Petuaria, close to the Humber Estuary.

====43–400s: Britannia Inferior====

Although the Roman conquest of Britain began in 43 AD, the Brigantes remained in control of their kingdom as a client state of Rome for an extended period, reigned over by the Brigantian monarchs Cartimandua and her husband Venutius. The capital was between the north and west ridings &quot;Isurium Brigantum&quot; (near Aldborough) &quot;civitas&quot; under Roman rule. Initially, this situation suited both the Romans and the Brigantes, who were known as the most militant tribe in Britain.

Queen Cartimandua left Venutius for his armour bearer, Vellocatus, setting off a chain of events that changed control of the region. Cartimandua&#x27;s good relationship with the Romans enabled her to keep control of the kingdom; however, her former husband staged rebellions against her and her Roman allies. At the second attempt, Venutius seized the kingdom, but the Romans, under general Petillius Cerialis, conquered the Brigantes in 71 AD.

The fortified city of Eboracum (now York) was named as capital of &quot;Britannia Inferior&quot; and joint capital of all Roman Britain. The emperor Septimius Severus ruled the Roman Empire from Eboracum for the two years before his death.

Another emperor, Constantius Chlorus, died in Eboracum during a visit in 306 AD. Thereafter his son Constantine the Great, who became renowned for his acceptance of Christianity, was proclaimed emperor in the city. In the early 5th century, Roman rule ceased with the withdrawal of the last active Roman troops. By this stage, the Western Empire was in intermittent decline.

===500s–1000s: Germanic landings===
====500s–800s: Celtic-Anglo kingdoms of Ebrauc, Elmet, Deira and Northumbria====
After the Romans left, small Celtic kingdoms arose in the region, including the kingdoms of Deira to the east (domain of settlements near Malton on Derwent), Ebrauc (domain of York) around the north and Elmet to the west. The latter two were successors of land south-west and north-east of the former Brigantia capital.

Angles (hailing from southern Denmark and northern Germany, probably along with Swedish Geats) consolidated (merging Ebrauc) under Deira, with York as capital. This in turn was grouped with Bernicia, another former Celtic-Brigantes kingdom that was north of the River Tees and had come to be headed by Bamburgh, to form Northumbria. Elmet had remained independent from the Germanic Angles until some time in the early 7th century, when King Edwin of Northumbria expelled its last king, Certic, and annexed the region to his Deira region. The Celts never went away, but were assimilated. This explains the existence of many Celtic placenames in Yorkshire today, such as Kingston upon Hull and Pen-y-ghent.

As well as the Angles and Geats, other settlers included Frisians (thought to have founded Fryston and Frizinghall), Danes, Franks and Huns.

At its greatest extent, Northumbria stretched from the Irish Sea to the North Sea and from Edinburgh down to Hallamshire in the south.

====800s–900s: Jórvík====
Scandinavian York (also referred to as Jórvík) or Danish/Norwegian York is a term used by historians for the south of Northumbria (modern-day Yorkshire) during the late 9th century and first half of the 10th century, when it was dominated by Norse warrior-kings; in particular, used to refer to York, the city controlled by these kings.

Norse monarchy controlled varying amounts of Northumbria from 875 to 954, however the area was invaded and conquered for short periods by England between 927 and 954 before eventually being annexed into England in 954. It was closely associated with the much longer-lived Kingdom of Dublin throughout this period.
An army of Danish Vikings, the Great Heathen Army as its enemies often referred to it, invaded Northumbrian territory in 866 AD. The Danes conquered and assumed what is now York and renamed it Jórvík, making it the capital city of a new Danish kingdom under the same name. The area which this kingdom covered included most of Southern Northumbria, roughly equivalent to the borders of Yorkshire extending further West.

The Danes went on to conquer an even larger area of England that afterwards became known as the Danelaw; but whereas most of the Danelaw was still English land, albeit in submission to Viking overlords, it was in the Kingdom of Jórvík that the only truly Viking territory on mainland Britain was ever established. The Kingdom prospered, taking advantage of the vast trading network of the Viking nations, and established commercial ties with the British Isles, North-West Europe, the Mediterranean and the Middle East.

Founded by the Dane Halfdan Ragnarsson in 875, ruled for the great part by Danish kings, and populated by the families and subsequent descendants of Danish Vikings, the leadership of the kingdom nonetheless passed into Norwegian hands during its twilight years. Eric Bloodaxe, an ex-king of Norway who was the last independent Viking king of Jórvík, is a particularly noted figure in history, and his bloodthirsty approach towards leadership may have been at least partly responsible for convincing the Danish inhabitants of the region to accept English sovereignty so readily in the years that followed.

====800s–1000s: Yorkshire====

After around 100 years of its volatile existence, the Kingdom of Jorvik finally came to an end. The Kingdom of Wessex was now in its ascendancy and established its dominance over the North in general, placing Yorkshire again within Northumbria, which retained a certain amount of autonomy as an almost-independent earldom rather than a separate kingdom. The Wessex Kings of England were reputed to have respected the Norse customs in Yorkshire and left law-making in the hands of the local aristocracy.

===1000s–1400s: Normans===
====1000s–1100s: Harrying of the north====

In the weeks leading up to the Battle of Hastings in 1066 AD, Harold II of England was distracted by pushing back efforts to reinstate the kingdom of Jorvik and Danelaw. His brother Tostig and Harald Hardrada, King of Norway, having won the Battle of Fulford. The King of England marched north where the two armies met at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. Tostig and Hardrada were both killed and their army was defeated decisively.

Harold Godwinson was forced immediately to march his army south, where William the Conqueror was landing. The King was defeated in what is now known as the Battle of Hastings, which led to the Norman conquest of England.

The people of the North rebelled against the Normans in September 1069 AD, enlisting Sweyn II of Denmark. They tried to take back York, but the Normans burnt it before they could. What followed was the Harrying of the North ordered by William. From York to Durham, crops, domestic animals, and farming tools were scorched. Many villages between the towns were burnt and local northerners were indiscriminately murdered. During the winter that followed, families starved to death and thousands of peasants died of cold and hunger. Orderic Vitalis estimated that &quot;more than 100,000&quot; people from the North died from hunger.
In the centuries following, many abbeys and priories were built in Yorkshire. Norman landowners increased their revenues and established new towns such as Barnsley, Doncaster, Hull, Leeds, Scarborough and Sheffield, among others. Of towns founded before the conquest, only Bridlington, Pocklington, and York continued at a prominent level.

In the early 12th century, people of Yorkshire had to contend with the Battle of the Standard at Northallerton with the Scots. Representing the Kingdom of England led by Archbishop Thurstan of York, soldiers from Yorkshire defeated the more numerous Scots.

====1300s: Scottish War of Independence and Mass Deaths====

The population of Yorkshire boomed until it was hit by the Great Famine of 1315. It did not help that after the English defeat in the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, the Scottish army rampaged throughout northern England, and Yorkshire was no exception. During The Great Raid of 1322, they raided and pillaged from the suburbs of York, even as far as East Riding and the Humber. Some, like Richmond, had to bribe the Scots to spare the town. The Black Death then reached Yorkshire by 1349, killing around a third of the population.

===1400s–1600s: Royal revolts===
====1400s: Wars of the Roses====
When King Richard II was overthrown in 1399, antagonism between the House of York and the House of Lancaster, both branches of the royal House of Plantagenet, began to emerge. Eventually the two houses fought for the throne of England in a series of civil wars, commonly known as the Wars of the Roses. Some of the battles took place in Yorkshire, such as those at Wakefield and Towton, the latter of which is known as the bloodiest battle ever fought on English soil. Richard III was the last Yorkist king.

Henry Tudor, sympathiser to the House of Lancaster, defeated and killed Richard at the Battle of Bosworth Field. He then became King Henry VII and married Elizabeth of York, daughter of Yorkist Edward IV, ending the wars. The two roses of white and red, emblems of the Houses of York and Lancaster respectively, were combined to form the Tudor Rose of England. This rivalry between the royal houses of York and Lancaster has passed into popular culture as a rivalry between the counties of Yorkshire and Lancashire, particularly in sport (for example the Roses Match played in County Cricket), although the House of Lancaster was based in York and the House of York in London.

====1500: Catholic–Protestant dissolution====
The English Reformation began under Henry VIII and the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536 led to a popular uprising known as Pilgrimage of Grace, started in Yorkshire as a protest. Some Catholics in Yorkshire continued to practise their religion and those caught were executed during the reign of Elizabeth I. One such person was a York woman named Margaret Clitherow who was later canonised.

====1600s: Civil war====

During the English Civil War, which started in 1642, Yorkshire had divided loyalties; Hull (full name Kingston upon Hull) famously shut the gates of the city on the king when he came to enter a few months before fighting began, while the North Riding of Yorkshire in particular was strongly royalist. York was the base for Royalists, and from there they captured Leeds and Wakefield only to have them recaptured a few months later. The royalists won the Battle of Adwalton Moor meaning they controlled Yorkshire (with the exception of Hull). From their base in Hull the Parliamentarians (&quot;Roundheads&quot;) fought back, re-taking Yorkshire town by town, until they won the Battle of Marston Moor and with it control of all of the North of England.

===1500s–1900s: Industry===
====1500-1600s: Explorative growth====

In the 16th and 17th centuries Leeds and other wool-industry-centred towns continued to grow, along with Huddersfield, Hull and Sheffield, while coal mining first came into prominence in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The wool textile industry, which had previously been a cottage industry, centred on the old market towns moved to the West Riding where entrepreneurs were building mills that took advantage of water power gained by harnessing the rivers and streams flowing from the Pennines. The developing textile industry helped Wakefield and Halifax grow.

====1800s: Victorian revolution====

The 19th century saw Yorkshire&#x27;s continued growth, with the population growing and the Industrial Revolution continuing with prominent industries in coal, textile and steel (especially in Sheffield, Rotherham and Middlesbrough). However, despite the booming industry, living conditions declined in the industrial towns due to overcrowding. This saw bouts of cholera in both 1832 and 1848. However, advances were made by the end of the century with the introduction of modern sewers and water supplies. Several Yorkshire railway networks were introduced as railways spread across the country to reach remote areas.
Canals and turnpike roads were introduced in the late 18th century. In the following century the spa towns of Harrogate and Scarborough flourished, due to people believing mineral water had curative properties.

When elected county councils were established in 1889, rather than have a single Yorkshire County Council, each of the three ridings was made an administrative county with its own county council, and the eight larger towns and cities of Bradford, Halifax, Huddersfield, Hull, Leeds, Middlesbrough, Sheffield and York were made county boroughs, independent from the county councils.

====Twentieth century to present====
During the Second World War, Yorkshire became an important base for RAF Bomber Command and brought the county and its productive industries into the cutting edge of the war, and thus in the targets of Luftwaffe bombers during the Battle of Britain.

From the late 20th century onwards there have been a number of significant reforms of the local government structures covering Yorkshire, notably in 1968, 1974, 1986, 1996 and 2023, discussed in the governance section below. For most administrative purposes the county had been divided since the Middle Ages; the last county-wide administrative role was the Sheriff of Yorkshire. The sheriff had been a powerful position in the Middle Ages but gradually lost most of its functions, and by the twentieth century was a largely ceremonial role. It was abolished as part of the 1974 reforms to local government, which established instead high sheriffs for each modern county.

==Geography==

Historically, the northern boundary of Yorkshire was the River Tees, the eastern boundary was the North Sea coast and the southern boundary was the Humber Estuary and Rivers Don and Sheaf. The western boundary meandered along the western slopes of the Pennine Hills to again meet the River Tees.

===Geology===
In Yorkshire there is a very close relationship between the major topographical areas and the geological period in which they were formed. The Pennine chain of hills in the west is of Carboniferous origin. The central vale is Permo-Triassic. The North York Moors in the north-east of the county are Jurassic in age while the Yorkshire Wolds to the south east are Cretaceous chalk uplands.

===Rivers===

Yorkshire is drained by several rivers. In western and central Yorkshire the many rivers flow into the River Ouse which reaches the North Sea via the Humber Estuary. The most northerly of the rivers in the Ouse system is the River Swale, which drains Swaledale before passing through Richmond and meandering across the Vale of Mowbray. Next, draining Wensleydale, is the River Ure, which the Swale joins east of Boroughbridge. Near Great Ouseburn the Ure is joined by the small Ouse Gill Beck, and below the confluence the river is known as the Ouse. The River Nidd rises on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales National Park and flows along Nidderdale before reaching the Vale of York and the Ouse. The River Wharfe, which drains Wharfedale, joins the Ouse upstream of Cawood. The Rivers Aire and Calder are more southerly contributors to the River Ouse and the most southerly Yorkshire tributary is the River Don, which flows northwards to join the main river at Goole. Further north and east the River Derwent rises on the North York Moors, flows south then westwards through the Vale of Pickering then turns south again to drain the eastern part of the Vale of York. It empties into the River Ouse at Barmby on the Marsh.

In the far north of the county the River Tees flows eastwards through Teesdale and empties its waters into the North Sea downstream of Middlesbrough. The smaller River Esk flows from west to east at the northern foot of the North York Moors to reach the sea at Whitby. To the east of the Yorkshire Wolds the River Hull flows southwards to join the Humber Estuary at Kingston upon Hull.

The western Pennines are drained by the River Ribble which flows westwards, eventually reaching the Irish Sea close to Lytham St Annes.

===Landscape===
The countryside of Yorkshire has been called &quot;God&#x27;s Own County&quot; by its inhabitants. Yorkshire includes the North York Moors and Yorkshire Dales National Parks, and part of the Peak District National Park. Nidderdale and the Howardian Hills are designated Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, as is the North Pennines (a part of which lies within the county). Spurn Point, Flamborough Head and the coastal North York Moors are designated Heritage Coast areas, and are noted for their scenic views with rugged cliffs such as the jet cliffs at Whitby, the limestone cliffs at Filey and the chalk cliffs at Flamborough Head. Moor House – Upper Teesdale, most of which is part of the former North Riding of Yorkshire, is one of England&#x27;s largest national nature reserves. At High Force on the border with County Durham, the River Tees plunges over the Whin Sill (an intrusion of igneous rock). High Force is not, as is sometimes claimed, the highest waterfall in England (Hardraw Force in Wensleydale, also in Yorkshire, has a drop for example). However, High Force is unusual in being on a major river and carries a greater volume of water than any higher waterfall in England.
The highest mountains in Yorkshire all lie in the Pennines on the western side of the county, with millstone grit and limestone forming the underlying geology and producing distinctive layered hills. The county top is the remote Mickle Fell (height above sea level) in the North Pennines southwest of Teesdale, which is also the highest point in the North Riding. The highest point in the West Riding is Whernside (height ) near to Ingleton in the Yorkshire Dales. Together with nearby Ingleborough (height ) and Pen-y-Ghent (height ), Whernside forms a trio of very prominent and popular summits (the Yorkshire Three Peaks) which can be climbed in a challenging single day&#x27;s walk. The highest point in the Yorkshire part of the Peak District is Black Hill (height ) on the border with historic Cheshire (which also forms the historic county top of that county). The hill ranges along the eastern side of Yorkshire are lower than those of the west. The highest point of the North York Moors is Urra Moor (height ). The highest point of the Yorkshire Wolds, a range of low chalk downlands east of York, is Bishop Wilton Wold (height ), which is also the highest point of the East Riding. The view from Sutton Bank at the southeastern edge of the North York Moors near Thirsk encompasses a vast expanse of the Yorkshire lowlands with the Pennines forming a backdrop. It was called the &quot;finest view in England&quot; by local author and veterinary surgeon James Herriot in his 1979 guidebook &quot;James Herriot&#x27;s Yorkshire&quot;.

The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds runs nature reserves such as the one at Bempton Cliffs with coastal wildlife such as the northern gannet, Atlantic puffin and razorbill. Spurn Point is a narrow long sand spit. It is a national nature reserve owned by the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust and is noted for its cyclical nature whereby the spit is destroyed and re-created approximately once every 250 years. There are seaside resorts in Yorkshire with sandy beaches; Scarborough is Britain&#x27;s oldest seaside resort dating back to the spa town-era in the 17th century, while Whitby has been voted as the United Kingdom&#x27;s best beach, with a &quot;postcard-perfect harbour&quot;.

===Towns and cities===
There are eight officially designated cities in Yorkshire: Bradford, Doncaster, Kingston upon Hull, Leeds, Ripon, Sheffield, Wakefield, and York. City status is formally held by the administrative territory rather than the urban area.

York is considered to have been a city since time immemorial. The other cities were formally awarded city status by the monarch; in the cases of Ripon and Wakefield following the creation of new Church of England dioceses, and in the other cases following significant urban growth. Middlesbrough is the largest built-up area in Yorkshire not to be a city. The largest built-up areas at the 2021 census were as follows:

==Governance==

There is no single Yorkshire-wide administrative body today. The area of the four ceremonial counties is administered by sixteen different local authorities, being nine metropolitan boroughs covering South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire and seven unitary authorities covering East Riding and North Yorkshire (one of which, Stockton-on-Tees, straddles the ceremonial boundary between North Yorkshire and County Durham). Most of the authorities are grouped into combined authorities, each led by a directly elected mayor. The combined authorities for West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire and Tees Valley are already operating. A new York and North Yorkshire Combined Authority was established in February 2024 with its first mayor due to be elected in May 2024, and proposals for establishing a combined authority covering Hull and East Riding are being considered.

Administrative hierarchy covering the four ceremonial counties as at March 2024:
The areas from the historic county that are not covered by the four ceremonial counties are now administered as parts of County Durham, Westmorland and Furness, Lancashire and Greater Manchester.

===Administrative history===
Historically, Yorkshire was divided into three ridings. The term &#x27;riding&#x27; is of Viking origin and derives from &quot;Threthingr&quot; (equivalent to third-ing). The three ridings in Yorkshire were named the East Riding, West Riding, and North Riding. Each riding was divided into smaller areas called wapentakes with more local functions. York was made a county corporate in 1396, as was Hull in 1440, making them independent from the ridings. York&#x27;s corporate territory was enlarged in 1449 to also include an adjoining rural area known as the Ainsty. Hull&#x27;s corporate territory covered both the town and adjoining areas, which were sometimes together known as Hullshire.

The Sheriff of Yorkshire was the most senior official position within the county in the Middle Ages. In 1547 a separate post of Lord Lieutenant of Yorkshire was created, taking some of the functions previously held by the sheriff. The single lieutenancy was split in 1660 into separate posts for the East Riding, North Riding and West Riding. For the purposes of lieutenancy, York was deemed part of the West Riding, and Hull was deemed part of the East Riding.

Elected county councils were established in 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888, taking over administrative functions previously performed by magistrates at the quarter sessions. The quarter sessions for Yorkshire were held separately for each riding. As such, three county councils were established rather than one for the whole county: East Riding County Council based in Beverley, North Riding County Council based in Northallerton, and West Riding County Council based in Wakefield. Each riding was classed as an administrative county, but provision was made that the entire county of Yorkshire should continue to be one county for the purposes of shrievalty, allowing the Sheriff of Yorkshire to continue to serve the whole county. Certain towns and cities were deemed large enough to provide their own county-level services and so they were made county boroughs, independent from the county councils. There were initially eight county boroughs in Yorkshire, being Bradford, Halifax, Huddersfield, Hull, Leeds, Middlesbrough, Sheffield, and York. Other county boroughs were subsequently created at Rotherham (1902), Barnsley (1913), Dewsbury (1913), Wakefield (1915) and Doncaster (1927).

More significant reviews of local government began to be considered following the Local Government Act 1958. The North Eastern General Review was held from 1962 to 1963, and led to the creation of the County Borough of Teesside in 1968, which covered the abolished county borough of Middlesbrough and several neighbours, including Stockton-on-Tees and Billingham, which had been in County Durham. Teesside was deemed part of the North Riding for ceremonial purposes, although as a county borough it was independent from North Riding County Council.

Almost as soon as Teesside had been created work began on a far more significant overhaul of local government, culminating in the Local Government Act 1972, which took effect on 1 April 1974. The county boroughs and the administrative counties of the ridings were abolished, as were the lower tier municipal boroughs, urban districts and rural districts. A new set of counties and districts was put in place instead. Most of Yorkshire was split between North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Humberside and Cleveland. Some peripheral rural areas were transferred to other counties, notably the Startforth area which went to County Durham, the Sedbergh area which went to Cumbria, the Forest of Bowland area which went to Lancashire, and Saddleworth which went to Greater Manchester. Some of the changes were unpopular, particularly in Humberside.
In 1986 the county councils for the metropolitan counties of South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire were abolished, with the metropolitan boroughs in those counties taking over county-level functions. Humberside and Cleveland were both abolished in 1996 with new unitary authorities established to cover those areas. At the same time York was enlarged and also made a unitary authority, independent from North Yorkshire County Council. The current ceremonial county boundaries were adopted at the time of the 1996 reforms, with a new ceremonial county called East Riding of Yorkshire created covering the parts of the abolished Humberside north of the Humber, whilst the parts of Cleveland south of the River Tees were added to North Yorkshire for ceremonial purposes.

From the 1990s there were attempts to establish a regional tier of local government; a Yorkshire and the Humber region was designated in 1994, covering North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and Humberside. Between 1998 and 2009 there was a Yorkshire and Humber Assembly comprising members of the region&#x27;s local authorities and other stakeholders. Since 2009 the region has been primarily used for presentation of statistics rather than administration.

In 2014 the first combined authorities started to be established in Yorkshire, with South Yorkshire (which initially branded itself the &quot;Sheffield City Region&quot;) and West Yorkshire having Yorkshire&#x27;s first combined authorities. In 2018, eighteen of the twenty-two local councils in the Yorkshire and Humber region voted to create instead a much larger combined authority, which they proposed calling &quot;One Yorkshire&quot; which would have covered the region except North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire. The plan included provision for a directly elected mayor for the area, and the scheme&#x27;s supporters estimated that it could create up to 200,000 jobs. The One Yorkshire proposal was ultimately rejected by the government in 2019, which preferred to continue with rolling out smaller combined authorities for parts of Yorkshire instead.

The districts of North Yorkshire were abolished in 2023, with North Yorkshire County Council taking over their functions to become a unitary authority, and rebranding itself North Yorkshire Council.

==Economy==

===South and West===

The City of Leeds is Yorkshire&#x27;s largest city and the leading centre of trade and commerce. Leeds is also one of the UK&#x27;s larger financial centres. Leeds&#x27;s traditional industries were mixed, service-based industries, textile manufacturing and coal mining being examples. Tourism is also significant and a growing sector in the city. In 2015, the value of tourism was in excess of £7 billion.

Bradford, Halifax, Keighley and Huddersfield once were centres of wool milling. Areas such as Bradford, Dewsbury and Keighley have suffered a decline in their economy since.

Sheffield once had heavy industries, such as coal mining and the steel industry. Since the decline of such industries Sheffield has attracted tertiary and administrative businesses including more retail trade, Meadowhall being an example.

Coal mining was extremely active in the south of the county during the 19th century and for most of the 20th century, particularly around Barnsley and Wakefield. As late as the 1970s, the number of miners working in the area was still in six figures. The industry was placed under threat on 6 March 1984 when the National Coal Board announced the closure of 20 pits nationwide (some of them in South Yorkshire). By March 2004, a mere three coalpits remained open in the area. Three years later, the only remaining coal pit in the region was Maltby Colliery near Rotherham. Maltby Colliery closed in 2013.

===East Riding and North===

North Yorkshire has an established tourist industry, supported by the presence of two national parks (Yorkshire Dales and North York Moors), Harrogate, York and Scarborough.

Tourism is a huge part of the economy of York with a value of over £765 million to the city and supporting 24,000 jobs in 2019. Harrogate draws numerous visitors because of its conference facilities. In 2016 such events alone attracted 300,000 visitors to Harrogate.

Kingston upon Hull is Yorkshire&#x27;s largest port and has a large manufacturing base, its fishing industry has, however, declined somewhat in recent years. Businesses in Hull are Aunt Bessie&#x27;s, Birds Eye, Seven Seas, Fenner, Rank Organisation, William Jackson Food Group, Reckitt and Sons, KCOM Group and SGS Europe.

Harrogate and Knaresborough both have small legal and financial sectors. Harrogate is a European conference and exhibition destination with both the Great Yorkshire Showground and Harrogate International Centre in the town. Bettys and Taylors of Harrogate is a notable company from Harrogate.

PD Ports owns and operates Teesport, between Middlesbrough and Redcar. The company also operates the Hull Container Terminal at the Port of Hull and owns a short river port in Howdendyke (near Howden).

Other businesses in the two counties are Plaxton (Scarborough), McCains (Scarborough), Ebuyer (Howden) and Skipton Building Society (Skipton).

==Education==
Yorkshire has a large base of primary and secondary schools operated by both local authorities and private bodies, and a dozen universities, along with a wide range of colleges and further education facilities. Five universities are based in Leeds, two in Sheffield, two in York, and one each in Bradford, Hull, Middlesbrough and Huddersfield. The largest universities by enrolment are Sheffield Hallam University and the University of Leeds, each with over 31,000 students, followed by Leeds Beckett University, and the most recent to attain university status is the Leeds Arts University. There are also branches of institutions headquartered in other parts of England, such as the Open University and Britain&#x27;s first for-profit university (since 2012), the University of Law. The tertiary sector is in active cooperation with industry, and a number of spin-off companies have been launched.

==Transport==

The oldest road in Yorkshire, called the Great North Road, is now known as the A1. This trunk road passes through the centre of the county and is the main route from London to Edinburgh. Another important road is the more easterly A19 road which starts in Doncaster and ends just north of Newcastle upon Tyne at Seaton Burn. The M62 motorway crosses the county from east to west from Hull towards Greater Manchester and Merseyside. The M1 carries traffic from London and the south of England to Yorkshire. In 1999, about was added to make it swing east of Leeds and connect to the A1. The East Coast Main Line rail link between London and Scotland runs roughly parallel with the A1 through Yorkshire and the Trans Pennine rail link runs east to west from Hull to Liverpool via Leeds.

Before the advent of rail transport, the seaports of Hull and Whitby played an important role in transporting goods. Historically canals were used, including the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, which is the longest canal in England. Mainland Europe (the Netherlands and Belgium) can be reached from Hull via regular ferry services from P&amp;O Ferries. Yorkshire also has air transport services from Leeds Bradford Airport. This airport has experienced significant and rapid growth in both terminal size and passenger facilities since 1996, when improvements began, until the present day. From 2005 until 2022, South Yorkshire was served by Doncaster Sheffield Airport in Finningley. Sheffield City Airport opened in 1997 after years of Sheffield having no airport, due to a council decision in the 1960s not to develop one because of the city&#x27;s good rail links with London and the development of airports in other nearby areas. The newly opened airport never managed to compete with larger airports such as Leeds Bradford Airport and East Midlands Airport and attracted only a few scheduled flights, while the runway was too short to support low cost carriers. The opening of Doncaster Sheffield Airport effectively made the airport redundant and it officially closed in April 2008. The Doncaster Sheffield Airport has since closed and left South Yorkshire without an airport.

===Public transport statistics===
The average amount of time people spend on public transport in Yorkshire on a weekday is 77 minutes. 26.6% of public transport users travel for more than two hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transport is 16 minutes, while 24.9% of passengers wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transport is 7 km, while 10% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.

==Architecture==
===Fortifications===

Throughout Yorkshire many castles were built during the Norman-Breton period, particularly after the Harrying of the North. These included Bowes Castle, Pickering Castle, Richmond Castle, Skipton Castle, York Castle and others. Later medieval castles at Helmsley, Middleham and Scarborough were built as a means of defence against the invading Scots. Middleham is notable because Richard III of England spent his childhood there. The remains of these castles, some being English Heritage sites, are popular tourist destinations.

===Stately===

There are stately homes in Yorkshire that carry the name &quot;castle&quot; in a similar way to the non-distinctive use of chateau in French. The most notable examples are Allerton Castle and Castle Howard, both linked to the Howard family. Castle Howard and the Earl of Harewood&#x27;s residence, Harewood House, are included amongst the nine Treasure Houses of England.

Large estates with significant buildings were constructed at Brodsworth Hall, Temple Newsam, Wentworth Woodhouse (the largest fronted private home in Europe), and Wentworth Castle. There are properties which are conserved and managed by the National Trust, such as Nunnington Hall, Ormesby Hall, the Rievaulx Terrace &amp; Temples and Studley Royal Park.

===Industrial===
Buildings built for industry during the Victorian era are found throughout the region; West Yorkshire has various cotton mills, the Leeds Corn Exchange and the Halifax Piece Hall.

===Municipal===

There are various buildings built for local authorities:
*Grade I listed; Leeds Town Hall, Sheffield Town Hall, Wakefield County Hall and York Guildhall
*Grade II* listed; Middlesbrough Town Hall, Leeds Civic Hall, Hull Guildhall, Hull City Hall and Sheffield City Hall.

===Religious===

Religious architecture includes extant cathedrals as well as the ruins of monasteries and abbeys. Many of these prominent buildings suffered from the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII; these include Bolton Abbey, Fountains Abbey, Gisborough Priory, Rievaulx Abbey, St Mary&#x27;s Abbey and Whitby Abbey among others. Notable religious buildings of historic origin still in use include York Minster, the largest Gothic cathedral in northern Europe, Beverley Minster, Bradford Cathedral, Rotherham Minster and Ripon Cathedral.

==Culture==
The culture of the people of Yorkshire is an accumulated product of a number of different civilisations who have influenced its history, including; the Celts (Brigantes and Parisii), Romans, Angles, Norse Vikings, and Normans amongst others. The western part of the historic North Riding had an additional infusion of Breton culture due to the Honour of Richmond being occupied by Alain Le Roux, grandson of Geoffrey I, Duke of Brittany. The people of Yorkshire are immensely proud of their county and local culture, and it is sometimes suggested they identify more strongly with their county than they do with their country. Yorkshire people have their own Yorkshire dialects and accents and are, or rather were, known as Broad Yorkshire or &quot;Tykes&quot;, with its roots in Old English and Old Norse.

The British Library provides a four minute long voice recording made in 1955, by a &quot;female housekeeper&quot;, Miss Madge Dibnahon, on its web site and an example of the Yorkshire dialect used at that time, in an unstated location. &quot;Much of her speech remains part of the local dialect to this day&quot;, according to the Library. Due to the large size of Yorkshire, spoken dialects vary between areas. In fact, the dialect in North Yorkshire and Humberside/East Yorkshire is &quot;quite different [than in West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire] and has a much stronger Scandinavian influence&quot;.

One report explains the geographic difference in detail:This distinction was first recognised formally at the turn of the 19th / 20th centuries, when linguists drew an isophone diagonally across the county from the northwest to the southeast, separating these two broadly distinguishable ways of speaking. It can be extended westwards through Lancashire to the estuary of the River Lune, and is sometimes called the Humber-Lune Line. Strictly speaking, the dialects spoken south and west of this isophone are Midland dialects, whereas the dialects spoken north and east of it are truly Northern. It is possible that the Midland form moved up into the region with people gravitating towards the manufacturing districts of the West Riding during the Industrial Revolution.

Though distinct accents remain, dialect has declined heavily in everyday use. Some have argued the dialect was a fully fledged language in its own right. The county has also produced a set of Yorkshire colloquialisms, which are in use in the county. Among Yorkshire&#x27;s traditions is the Long Sword dance. The most famous traditional song of Yorkshire is &quot;On Ilkla Moor Baht &#x27;at&quot; (&quot;On Ilkley Moor without a hat&quot;), it is considered the unofficial anthem of the county.

===Literature and art===

Although the first Professor of English Literature at Leeds University, F. W. Moorman, claimed the first extant work of English literature, &quot;Beowulf&quot;, was written in Yorkshire, this view does not have common acceptance today. However, when Yorkshire formed the southern part of the kingdom of Northumbria there were several notable poets, scholars and ecclesiastics, including Alcuin, Cædmon and Wilfrid. The most esteemed literary family from the county are the three Brontë sisters, with part of the county around Haworth being nicknamed Brontë Country in their honour. Their novels, written in the mid-19th century, caused a sensation when they were first published, yet were subsequently accepted into the canon of great English literature. Among the most celebrated novels written by the sisters are Anne Brontë&#x27;s &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot;, Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; and Emily Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; was almost a source used to depict life in Yorkshire, illustrating the type of people that reside there in its characters, and emphasising the use of the stormy Yorkshire moors. Nowadays, the parsonage which was their former home is now a museum in their honour. Bram Stoker authored &quot;Dracula&quot; while living in Whitby and it includes several elements of local folklore including the beaching of the Russian ship &quot;Dmitri&quot;, which became the basis of Demeter in the book.

The novelist tradition in Yorkshire continued into the 20th and 21st centuries, with authors such as J. B. Priestley, Alan Bennett, Stan Barstow, Dame Margaret Drabble, Winifred Holtby (&quot;South Riding, The Crowded Street&quot;), A. S. Byatt, Joanne Harris, Barbara Taylor Bradford, Marina Lewycka and Sunjeev Sahota being prominent examples. Taylor Bradford is noted for &quot;A Woman of Substance&quot; which was one of the top-ten best selling novels in history. Another well-known author was children&#x27;s writer Arthur Ransome, who penned the &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; series. James Herriot, the best selling author of over 60 million copies of books about his experiences of some 50 years as a veterinarian in Thirsk, North Yorkshire, the town which he refers to as Darrowby in his books (although born in Sunderland), has been admired for his easy reading style and interesting characters.

Poets include Ted Hughes, W. H. Auden, William Empson, Simon Armitage, David Miedzianik and Andrew Marvell.
Three well known sculptors emerged in the 20th century; contemporaries Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth, and Leeds-raised land artist Andy Goldsworthy. Some of their works are available for public viewing at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park. There are several art galleries in Yorkshire featuring extensive collections, such as Ferens Art Gallery, Leeds Art Gallery, Millennium Galleries and York Art Gallery. Some of the better known local painters are William Etty and David Hockney; many works by the latter are housed at Salts Mill 1853 Gallery in Saltaire.

===Cuisine===

The traditional cuisine of Yorkshire, in common with the North of England in general, is known for using rich-tasting ingredients, especially with regard to sweet dishes, which were affordable for the majority of people. There are several dishes which originated in Yorkshire or are heavily associated with it. Yorkshire pudding, a savoury batter dish, is by far the best known of Yorkshire foods, and is eaten throughout England. It is commonly served with roast beef and vegetables to form part of the Sunday roast but is traditionally served as a starter dish filled with onion gravy within Yorkshire. Yorkshire pudding is the base for toad in the hole, a dish containing sausage.

Other foods associated with the county include Yorkshire curd tart, a curd tart recipe with rosewater; parkin, a sweet ginger cake which is different from standard ginger cakes in that it includes oatmeal and treacle; and Wensleydale cheese, a cheese made with milk from Wensleydale and often eaten as an accompaniment to sweet foods. The beverage ginger beer, flavoured with ginger, came from Yorkshire and has existed since the mid-18th century. Liquorice sweet was first created by George Dunhill from Pontefract, who in the 1760s thought to mix the liquorice plant with sugar. Yorkshire and in particular the city of York played a prominent role in the confectionery industry, with chocolate factories owned by companies such as Rowntree&#x27;s, Terry&#x27;s and Thorntons inventing many of Britain&#x27;s most popular sweets. Another traditional Yorkshire food is pikelets, which are similar to crumpets but much thinner. The Rhubarb Triangle is a location within Yorkshire which supplies most of the rhubarb to locals.

In recent years curries have become popular in the county, largely due to the immigration and successful integration of Asian families. There are many famous curry empires with their origins in Yorkshire, including the 850-seater Aakash restaurant in Cleckheaton, which has been described as &quot;the world&#x27;s largest curry house&quot;.

===Beer and brewing===

Yorkshire has a number of breweries including Black Sheep, Copper Dragon, Cropton Brewery, John Smith&#x27;s, Samuel Smith Old Brewery, Kelham Island Brewery, Theakstons, Timothy Taylor, Wharfedale Brewery, Harrogate Brewery and Leeds Brewery.
The beer style most associated with the county is bitter. As elsewhere in the North of England, when served through a handpump, a sparkler is used giving a tighter, more solid head.

Brewing has taken place on a large scale since at least the 12th century, for example at the now derelict Fountains Abbey which at its height produced 60 barrels of strong ale every ten days. Most current Yorkshire breweries date from the Industrial Revolution of the late 18th and early 19th century.

===Music===

Yorkshire has a heritage of folk music and folk dance including the Long Sword dance. Yorkshire folk song was distinguished by the use of dialect, particularly in the West Riding and exemplified by the song &#x27;On Ilkla Moor Baht &#x27;at&#x27;, probably written in the late 19th century, using a Kent folk tune (almost certainly borrowed via a Methodist hymnal), seen as an unofficial Yorkshire anthem. Famous folk performers from the county include the Watersons from Hull, who began recording Yorkshire versions of folk songs from 1965; Heather Wood (born 1945) of the Young Tradition; the short-lived electric folk group Mr Fox (1970–72), the Deighton Family; Julie Matthews; Kathryn Roberts; and Kate Rusby. Yorkshire has a flourishing folk music culture, with over forty folk clubs and thirty annual folk music festivals. The 1982 Eurovision Song Contest was held in the Harrogate International Centre. In 2007 the Yorkshire Garland Group was formed to make Yorkshire folk songs accessible online and in schools.

In the field of classical music, Yorkshire has produced some major and minor composers, including Frederick Delius, George Dyson, Philip Wilby, Edward Bairstow, William Baines, Kenneth Leighton, Bernadette Farrell, Eric Fenby, Anne Quigley, Haydn Wood, Arthur Wood, Arnold Cooke, Gavin Bryars, John Casken, and in the area of TV, film and radio music, John Barry and Wally Stott. Opera North is based at the Grand Theatre, Leeds. Leeds is also home to the Leeds International Piano Competition. The Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival takes place annually in November. Huddersfield Choral Society is one of the UK&#x27;s most celebrated amateur choirs. The National Centre for Early Music is located in York.

The county is home to successful brass bands such as Black Dyke, Brighouse &amp; Rastrick, Carlton Main Frickley, Hammonds Saltaire, and Yorkshire Imperial.
During the 1970s David Bowie, himself of a father from Doncaster in the West Riding of Yorkshire, hired three musicians from Hull: Mick Ronson, Trevor Bolder and Mick Woodmansey; together they recorded &quot;Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot;, an album considered by a magazine article as one of a 100 greatest and most influential of all time. In the following decade, Def Leppard, from Sheffield, achieved worldwide fame, particularly in America. Their 1983 album &quot;Pyromania&quot; and 1987 album &quot;Hysteria&quot; sold 12 and 25 million copies respectively. Yorkshire had a very strong post-punk scene which went on to achieve widespread acclaim and success, including: the Sisters of Mercy, the Cult, Vardis, Gang of Four, ABC, the Human League, New Model Army, Soft Cell, Chumbawamba, the Wedding Present and the Mission. Pulp from Sheffield had a massive hit in &quot;Common People&quot; during 1995; the song focuses on working-class northern life. In the 21st century, indie rock and post-punk revival bands from the area gained popularity, including the Kaiser Chiefs, the Cribs and the Arctic Monkeys, the last-named holding the record for the fastest-selling debut album in British music history with &quot;Whatever People Say I Am, That&#x27;s What I&#x27;m Not&quot;.

Influenced by the local post punk scene, but also by national and international extreme metal acts such as Celtic Frost, Candlemass, and Morbid Angel, Yorkshire-based bands Paradise Lost and My Dying Bride laid the foundations of what would become the Gothic Metal genre in the early to mid-1990s.

===Television productions===
Among prominent British television shows filmed in (and based on) Yorkshire are the soap opera &quot;Emmerdale&quot; and the sitcom &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;; the latter in particular is noted for holding the record of longest-running comedy series in the world, from 1973 until 2010. Other notable television series set in Yorkshire include &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;, &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;, &quot;The Beiderbecke Trilogy&quot;, &quot;Rising Damp&quot;, &quot;Open All Hours&quot;, &quot;Band Of Gold&quot;, &quot;Dalziel and Pascoe&quot;, &quot;Fat Friends&quot;, &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, &quot;The Syndicate&quot;, &quot;No Angels&quot;, &quot;Drifters&quot; and &quot;The Royal&quot;. During the first three series of the sitcom &quot;The New Statesman&quot;, Alan B&#x27;Stard represented as MP the fictional constituency of Haltenprice in North Yorkshire.

Yorkshire has remained a popular location for filming in more recent times. For example, much of ITV&#x27;s highly acclaimed &quot;Victoria&quot; was filmed in the region, at locations such as Harewood House in Leeds and Beverley Minster (the latter being used to depict Westminster Abbey and St James&#x27; Palace), whilst Channel 5 has programmed numerous Yorkshire-themed documentary series such as &quot;Our Yorkshire Farm&quot; and &quot;The Yorkshire Steam Railway: All Aboard&quot; across its schedule.

West Yorkshire has particularly benefited from a great deal of production activity. For example, portions of the BBC television series &quot;Happy Valley&quot; and &quot;Last Tango in Halifax&quot; were filmed in the area, in Huddersfield and other cities; in addition to exteriors, some of the studio filming for &quot;Happy Valley&quot; was done at North Light Film Studios at Brookes Mill, Huddersfield. Although set in the fictional town of Denton, popular ITV detective series &quot;A Touch Of Frost&quot; was filmed in Yorkshire, mainly in and around Leeds. The BBC&#x27;s &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot; and &quot;Remember Me&quot; and the ITV series &quot;Black Work&quot; were also filmed at the studios and in nearby West Yorkshire locations. More recently, many of the exteriors of the BBC series &quot;Jericho&quot; were filmed at the nearby Rockingstone Quarry, and some interior work was done at North Light Film Studios.

===Film productions===
Several noted films are set in Yorkshire, including &quot;Kes&quot;, &quot;This Sporting Life&quot;, &quot;Room at the Top&quot;, &quot;Brassed Off&quot;, &quot;Mischief Night&quot;, &quot;Rita, Sue and Bob Too&quot;, &quot;The Damned United&quot;, &quot;Four Lions&quot;, &quot;God&#x27;s Own Country&quot; and &quot;Calendar Girls&quot;. &quot;The Full Monty&quot;, a comedy film set in Sheffield, won an Academy Award and was voted the second-best British film of all time by Asian News International.

==Politics and identity==

===Constituencies===
From 1290, Yorkshire was represented by two members of parliament of the House of Commons of the Parliament of England. After the union with Scotland, two members represented the county in the Parliament of Great Britain from 1707 to 1800 and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1832. In 1832 the county benefited from the disfranchisement of Grampound by taking an additional two members. Yorkshire was represented at this time as one single, large, county constituency. Like other counties, there were also some parliamentary boroughs within Yorkshire, the oldest of which was the City of York, which had existed since the ancient Montfort&#x27;s Parliament of 1265. After the Reform Act 1832, Yorkshire&#x27;s political representation in parliament was drawn from its subdivisions, with members of parliament representing each of the three historic Ridings of Yorkshire; East Riding, North Riding, and West Riding constituencies.

For the 1865 general elections and onwards, the West Riding was further divided into Northern, Eastern and Southern parliamentary constituencies, though these only lasted until the major Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. This act saw more localisation of government in the United Kingdom, with the introduction of 26 new parliamentary constituencies within Yorkshire.

With the Representation of the People Act 1918 there was some reshuffling on a local level for the 1918 general election, revised again during the 1950s.

===Distinctive identity===
A number of claims have been made for the distinctiveness of Yorkshire, as a geographical, cultural and political entity, and these have been used to demand increased political autonomy. In the early twentieth century, F. W. Moorman, the first professor of English language at Leeds University, claimed Yorkshire was not settled by Angles or Saxons following the end of Roman rule in Britain, but by a different Germanic tribe, the Geats. As a consequence, he claimed, it is possible the first work of English literature, &quot;Beowulf&quot;, believed to have been composed by Geats, was written in Yorkshire, and this distinctive ethnic and cultural origin is the root of the unique status of Yorkshire today. One of Moorman&#x27;s students at Leeds University, Herbert Read, was greatly influenced by Moorman&#x27;s ideas on Yorkshire identity, and claimed that until recent times Yorkshire was effectively an island, cut off from the rest of England by rivers, fens, moors and mountains. This distancing of Yorkshire from England led Read to question whether Yorkshire people were really English at all. Combined with the suggested ethnic difference from the rest of England, Read quoted Frederic Pearson, who wrote:

During the premiership of William Pitt the Younger the hypothetical idea of Yorkshire becoming independent was raised in the British parliament in relation to the question whether Ireland should become part of the United Kingdom. This resulted in the publication of an anonymous pamphlet in London in 1799 arguing at length that Yorkshire could never be an independent state as it would always be reliant on the rest of the United Kingdom to provide it with essential resources.

Although in the devolution debates in the House of Commons of the late 1960s, which paved the way for the 1979 referendums on the creation of a Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly, parallel devolution for Yorkshire was suggested, this was opposed by the Scottish National Party Member of Parliament for Hamilton, Winifred Ewing. Ewing argued that it was offensive to Scots to argue that an English region had the same status as an &#x27;ancient nation&#x27; such as Scotland.

The relationship between Yorkshire and Scottish devolution was again made in 1975 by Richard Wainwright, MP for Colne Valley, who claimed in a speech in the House of Commons:

Following the local government reforms of 1974, Yorkshire lost its overall sheriff and the ridings lost their lieutenants and administrative counties. Although some government officials and King Charles have asserted such reform is not meant to alter the ancient boundaries or cultural loyalties, there are pressure groups such as the Yorkshire Ridings Society who want greater recognition for the historic boundaries.

In 1998 the Campaign for Yorkshire was established to push for the creation of a Yorkshire regional assembly, sometimes dubbed the Yorkshire Parliament. In its defining statement, the Campaign for Yorkshire made reference to the historical notions that Yorkshire had a distinctive identity:

The Campaign for Yorkshire was led by Jane Thomas as Director and Paul Jagger as chairman. Jagger claimed in 1999 that Yorkshire had as much right to a regional parliament or assembly as Scotland and Wales because Yorkshire &#x27;has as clear a sense of identity as Scotland or Wales.&#x27; One of those brought into the Campaign for Yorkshire by Jane Thomas was Herbert Read scholar Michael Paraskos, who organised a series of events in 2000 to highlight the distinctiveness of Yorkshire culture. This included a major exhibition of Yorkshire artists. Paraskos also founded a Yorkshire Studies degree course at Hull University. Interviewed by &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, Paraskos linked the start of this course to the contemporary devolution debates in Yorkshire, Scotland and Wales, claiming:

In March 2013, the Yorkshire Devolution Movement was founded as an active campaign group by Nigel Sollitt, who had administered the social media group by that name since 2011, Gareth Shanks, a member of the social media group, and Stewart Arnold, former Chair of the Campaign for Yorkshire. In September 2013, the executive committee was joined by Richard Honnoraty and Richard Carter (as an advisor), who had also been involved in the Campaign for Yorkshire. The Movement campaigns for a directly elected parliament for the whole of the traditional county of Yorkshire with powers second to no other devolved administration in the UK.

In 2014, Richard Carter, Stewart Arnold and Richard Honnoraty, founded Yorkshire First, a political party campaigning for the creation of a Yorkshire parliament by 2050 based on the Scottish Parliament. It was later renamed the Yorkshire Party. A Social democratic party, it has parish, town, district and county councillors, and stood in 28 constituencies in the 2019 general election. Yorkshire Party candidates have also run for the position of directly elected mayors in Doncaster in 2017 (receiving 3,235 votes, 5.04%) and the Sheffield City Region in 2018 (receiving 22,318 votes, 8.6).

===Monarchy and peerage===

When the territory of Yorkshire began to take shape as a result of the invasion of the Danish Vikings, they instituted a monarchy based at the settlement of Jórvík, York. The reign of the Viking kings came to an end with the last king Eric Bloodaxe dying in battle in 954 after the invasion and conquest by the Kingdom of England from the south. Jórvík was the last of the independent kingdoms to be taken to form part of the Kingdom of England and thus the local monarchal title became defunct.

Though the monarchal title became defunct, it was succeeded by the creation of the Earl of York title of nobility by king of England Edgar the Peaceful in 960. (The earldom covered the general area of Yorkshire and is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Earl of Yorkshire&quot;.) The title passed through the hands of various nobles, decided upon by the king of England. The last man to hold the title was William le Gros, however the earldom was abolished by Henry II as a result of a troubled period known as &quot;The Anarchy&quot;.

The peerage was recreated by Edward III in 1385, this time in the form of the prestigious title of Duke of York which he gave to his son Edmund of Langley. Edmund founded the House of York; later the title was merged with that of the King of England. Much of the modern-day symbolism of Yorkshire, such as the White Rose of York, is derived from the Yorkists, giving the house a special affinity within the culture of Yorkshire. Especially celebrated is the Yorkist king Richard III who spent much of his life at Middleham Castle in Yorkshire. Since that time the title has passed through the hands of many, being merged with the crown and then recreated several times. The title of Duke of York is given to the second son of the British monarch.

<doc id="36646" wikidata="Q435306" url="?curid=36646" title="Lindsey Buckingham">
<text>Lindsey Adams Buckingham (born October 3, 1949) is an American musician, record producer, and the lead guitarist and co-lead vocalist of the rock band Fleetwood Mac from 1975 to 1987 and 1997 to 2018. In addition to his tenure with Fleetwood Mac, Buckingham has released seven solo studio albums and three live albums. As a member of Fleetwood Mac, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998. Buckingham was ranked 100th in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2011 list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;. Buckingham is known for his fingerpicking guitar style.

Buckingham joined Fleetwood Mac in 1975, replacing guitarist Bob Welch, and convinced the group to recruit his musical (and, at the time, romantic) partner Stevie Nicks as well. Buckingham and Nicks became prominent members of Fleetwood Mac during its most commercially successful period, highlighted by the multi-platinum studio album &quot;Rumours&quot; (1977), which sold over 40 million copies worldwide. Though highly successful, the group experienced almost constant creative and personal conflict, and Buckingham left the band in 1987 to focus on his solo career. Hit songs Buckingham wrote and sang with Fleetwood Mac include &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot;, &quot;Never Going Back Again&quot;, &quot;Tusk&quot;, and &quot;Big Love&quot;.

A one-off reunion at the 1993 inauguration ball for President Bill Clinton initiated some rapprochement between the former band members, with Buckingham performing some vocals on one track of their 1995 studio album &quot;Time&quot;, and rejoining the band full-time in 1997 for the live tour and album &quot;The Dance&quot;. In 2018, Buckingham was fired from Fleetwood Mac and replaced by Mike Campbell and Neil Finn.

==Early life==
Lindsey Adams Buckingham was born on October 3, 1949, in Palo Alto, California, to Morris H. Buckingham and Rutheda, née Elliott. Morris H. Buckingham, who was a football star at San Jose State College, by 1963 served as President of Alexander-Ballert Company of San Francisco, a producer of roasted coffee beans, and ran a coffee plant near Palo Alto. California&#x27;s popular Alta Organic Coffee remains one of their brands. Buckingham had two older brothers, Jeffrey and Gregory. Growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area community of Atherton, he attended Menlo-Atherton High School where Buckingham and his brothers were encouraged to swim competitively. Though Buckingham dropped out of athletics to pursue music, his brother Gregory went on to win a silver medal at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City. Though he did not graduate, Lindsey attended San José State University, like his brother Greg and father Morris.

Buckingham&#x27;s first forays into guitar playing took place on a toy Mickey Mouse guitar, playing along to his brother Jeff&#x27;s extensive collection of 45s. Noticing his talent, Buckingham&#x27;s parents bought their son a $35 Harmony guitar.

Buckingham never took guitar lessons and does not read music. By age 13, he became interested in folk music and, influenced by banjo methods, practiced the energetic style of the Kingston Trio.

==Music career==
From 1966 to 1971, Buckingham performed psychedelic and folk rock with the high school rock band originally named the Fritz Rabyne Memorial Band as a bassist and vocalist. The band regrouped in 1967 due to band member changes and shortened their name to Fritz. Buckingham invited friend Stevie Nicks to join Fritz as a backing vocalist. Their romantic relationship began after both left Fritz five years later.

===1973–1974: Buckingham Nicks===
Buckingham and his then-girlfriend Stevie Nicks recorded seven demos in 1972 on a half-inch 4-track Ampex recorder kept at his father&#x27;s coffee-roasting plant in Daly City, then drove to Los Angeles to pursue a recording contract. In 1973, Polydor Records signed the pair. Their studio album, produced by Keith Olsen and second engineer Richard Dashut, &quot;Buckingham Nicks&quot;, was released in September 1973; however, soon after its release Polydor dropped the duo because of poor sales. To help make ends meet, Buckingham toured with Don Everly&#x27;s backing band, singing Phil Everly&#x27;s parts.

===1975–1980: Fleetwood Mac and mainstream success===

While investigating Sound City recording studio in California, Mick Fleetwood heard the song &quot;Frozen Love&quot; from the &quot;Buckingham Nicks&quot; studio album. Impressed, he asked who the guitarist was. By chance, Buckingham and Nicks were also in Sound City recording demos, and Buckingham and Fleetwood were introduced. When Bob Welch left Fleetwood Mac in December 1974, Fleetwood immediately contacted Buckingham and offered him the vacant guitar slot in his band. Buckingham told Fleetwood that he and Nicks were a team and that he didn&#x27;t want to work without her. Fleetwood agreed to hire both of them, without an audition. Buckingham and Nicks then began a short tour to promote the &quot;Buckingham Nicks&quot; album. The touring band included drummers Bob Aguirre and Gary Hodges (playing simultaneously) and bassist Tom Moncrieff, who later played bass on Nicks&#x27; debut solo studio album &quot;Bella Donna&quot; (1981). When they played in Alabama, the one area where they saw appreciable sales, they told their fans they had joined Fleetwood Mac.

Fleetwood Mac released their eponymously titled studio album in 1975, which reached number one on the American charts. Buckingham contributed two songs to the album, &quot;Monday Morning&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m So Afraid&quot;, while also singing lead on &quot;Blue Letter&quot; and Nicks&#x27; song &quot;Crystal&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;m So Afraid&quot; and &quot;Monday Morning&quot; were intended for the planned follow-up Buckingham Nicks studio album, but they were instead used with Fleetwood Mac.

Despite the success of the new line-up&#x27;s first studio album, it was their second studio album together, &quot;Rumours&quot; (1977), that propelled the band to superstar status, becoming one of the best-selling studio albums of all time. Buckingham&#x27;s &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot; was the lead single, soaring into the US Top Ten; also on the album were Buckingham&#x27;s &quot;Second Hand News&quot; and &quot;Never Going Back Again&quot;. Buckingham also sang co-lead vocal on two of the band&#x27;s biggest live staples: &quot;The Chain&quot;, written by the entire band, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;, a Christine McVie number.

After the commercial success of &quot;Rumours&quot; (during the making of which Buckingham and Nicks broke up), Buckingham was determined to avoid falling into repeating the same musical pattern. The result was &quot;Tusk&quot; (1979), a double studio album that Buckingham primarily directed. Once again, Buckingham wrote the lead single, the title track that peaked at No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Buckingham convinced Fleetwood to let his work on their next studio album be more experimental and to be allowed to work on tracks at home before bringing them to the rest of the band in the studio. It produced three hit singles: Lindsey Buckingham&#x27;s &quot;Tusk&quot; (US No. 8), which featured the USC Trojan Marching Band, Christine McVie&#x27;s &quot;Think About Me&quot; (US No. 20), and Stevie Nicks&#x27; 6½-minute opus &quot;Sara&quot; (US No. 7). &quot;Sara&quot; was cut to 4½ minutes for both the hit single and the first CD-release of the album, but the unedited version has since been restored on the 1988 greatest hits compilation, the 2004 reissue of &quot;Tusk&quot; and Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s 2002 release of &quot;The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac&quot;. Original guitarist Peter Green also took part in the sessions of &quot;Tusk&quot;, although his playing on the Christine McVie track &quot;Brown Eyes&quot; is not credited on the album.

===1981: Going solo and &quot;Law and Order&quot;===
During the time he worked on &quot;Tusk&quot;, Buckingham also produced studio albums for Walter Egan and John Stewart in the late 1970s as well as beginning work on his own solo studio album.

In 1981, Buckingham released his debut solo studio album, &quot;Law and Order&quot;, playing nearly every instrument and featuring guest appearances by bandmates Mick Fleetwood and Christine McVie. The album pursued the quirky, eclectic, often lo-fi and new wave influences of &quot;Tusk&quot; and spawned the single &quot;Trouble&quot; (inspired by Fleetwood Mac producer Richard Dashut), which reached No. 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 1 in Australia (for three weeks).

===1982: &quot;Mirage&quot;===
After a large world tour that ended in 1980, Fleetwood Mac took a year-long break before reconvening to record their next studio album &quot;Mirage&quot; (1982), a more pop-friendly work that returned the band to the top of the US album chart. However, by this time various members of the band were enjoying success as solo artists (particularly Nicks) and the next Fleetwood Mac album was not released until five years later.

===1983–1986: &quot;Go Insane&quot; and other solo projects===
In 1983, he wrote and performed the songs &quot;Holiday Road&quot; and &quot;Dancin&#x27; Across the USA&quot; for the film &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot;. &quot;Holiday Road&quot; was released as a single and reached No. 82 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100.

In 1984, after ending his 7-year relationship with Carol Ann Harris, he released his second solo studio album, &quot;Go Insane&quot;. The title track was a modest hit, reaching No. 23 on the Hot 100. In 2008, he revealed the title track was about his post-breakup relationship with Stevie Nicks; however, Harris claimed in her memoir &quot;Storms&quot; that the song was written about her breakup with Buckingham. The last track of the album, &quot;D.W. Suite&quot;, was a tribute to the late Beach Boys drummer Dennis Wilson, a close friend of Fleetwood Mac who was briefly engaged to Christine McVie. Also that year, Buckingham played guitars and sang harmony vocals on the track &quot;You Can&#x27;t Make Love&quot; from Don Henley&#x27;s second solo studio album &quot;Building the Perfect Beast&quot;.

The next year, Buckingham performed on USA for Africa&#x27;s fundraising single, &quot;We Are the World&quot;. In 1986, he co-wrote &quot;Since You&#x27;ve Gone&quot; for Belinda Carlisle&#x27;s debut solo studio album, &quot;Belinda&quot;. He did other soundtrack work, including the song &quot;Time Bomb Town&quot; from &quot;Back to the Future&quot; (1985). Buckingham played all of the instruments on the track except drums, which were played by Michael Huey.

===1987: &quot;Tango In the Night&quot; and departure from Fleetwood Mac===
Buckingham&#x27;s fifth studio album with Fleetwood Mac, &quot;Tango in the Night&quot;, was released in 1987. Buckingham had already released two solo studio albums and had given up much of the material for what would have been his third solo studio album for the project, including &quot;Big Love&quot;, &quot;Tango in the Night &quot;, &quot;Family Man&quot;, &quot;You and I&quot; and &quot;Caroline&quot;. &quot;Big Love&quot;, released as the first single from the album, became a top ten hit in the US and the UK.

Propelled by a string of hit singles, &quot;Tango in the Night&quot; became the band&#x27;s biggest studio album since &quot;Rumours&quot; a decade earlier. However, following its release, Buckingham left Fleetwood Mac largely because of his desire not to tour and the strain he was feeling within the band. &quot;I needed to get some separation from Stevie especially because I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever quite gotten closure on our relationship,&quot; he said. &quot;I needed to get on with the next phase of my creative growth and my emotional growth. When you break up with someone and then for the next 10 years you have to be around them and do for them and watch them move away from you, it&#x27;s not easy.&quot; Fleetwood Mac continued without him, and Buckingham was replaced by two guitarists, Rick Vito and Billy Burnette.

===1988–1992: &quot;Out of the Cradle&quot;===
Following his departure from Fleetwood Mac in 1987, Buckingham spent much of the next five years in the studio, working on his third solo studio album, &quot;Out of the Cradle&quot;, which was released in 1992. Many of the songs deal with his relationship with Nicks and his decision to leave the band. &quot;There were things lingering for years having to do with relationships and the band, hurtful things, that were impossible to deal with until I left. If you were in a relationship and split up, then had to see that person every day for the next 15 years, it might keep you from dealing with some of those things. While we made &quot;Rumours&quot; (in 1977) there were two couples breaking up in the band (Buckingham and Nicks, and John and Christine McVie), and we had to say, &#x27;This is an important thing we&#x27;re doing, so we&#x27;ve got to put this set of feelings on this side of the room and get on with it.&#x27; And when you do that long enough you forget that those feelings are even there. On this album, I&#x27;m putting all these feelings in the healthiest possible perspective and that, looking at it broadly, is a lot of what the album is dealing with. It&#x27;s a catharsis, absolutely.&quot; &quot;Wrong&quot; was a gentle rebuke of former bandmate Mick Fleetwood&#x27;s tell-all biography, published in 1990. &quot;Out of the Cradle&quot; received some favorable reviews but did not achieve the sales levels associated with Fleetwood Mac. However, Buckingham toured throughout 1992–93 for the first time as a solo artist; his band included an army of seven other guitarists (Buckingham himself calls them &quot;the crazy band&quot; on his &quot;Soundstage&quot; DVD), each of whom he individually taught the entire two-and-a-half hours of music from the concert (&quot;Lindsey Buckingham: Behind the Music&quot; documentary for VH1, 2001).

===1993–2004: Return to Fleetwood Mac===

In 1993, newly elected president Bill Clinton asked Fleetwood Mac to come together to perform the song he had chosen for his campaign, the Christine McVie-penned &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;, at his inauguration on January 20, 1993. Buckingham agreed to be part of the performance, but the experience was something of a one-off for the band, who were still very much at odds with one another and had no plans to reunite officially.

While assembling material for a planned fourth solo studio album in the mid-1990s, Buckingham contacted Mick Fleetwood for assistance on a song. Their collaboration lasted much longer than anticipated, and the two eventually decided to call upon Stevie Nicks, John and Christine McVie. In 1997, Buckingham and all four of his bandmates from the &quot;Rumours&quot;-era line-up of Fleetwood Mac went on the road for the first time together since 1982 in a reunion tour titled &quot;The Dance&quot;. The tour was hugely successful and did much to heal the damage that had been done between Buckingham and his bandmates. However, Christine McVie left the band in 1998 because of her fear of flying and to be with her family in the UK, thus making Fleetwood Mac a four-piece band.

A subsequent fourth solo studio album, titled &quot;Gift of Screws&quot;, was recorded between 1995 and 2001 and presented to Warner Bros. and Reprise for release. Executives at the label managed to persuade Buckingham to hold the album back and instead take several tracks from &quot;Gift of Screws&quot; and use them with Fleetwood Mac. In 2003, the reformed band released the first studio album involving Buckingham and Nicks in 15 years, &quot;Say You Will&quot;. Buckingham&#x27;s song &quot;Peacekeeper&quot; was the first single from the album, and the band went on a world concert tour that lasted almost a year and a half. Seven songs from &quot;Gift of Screws&quot; appear on the Fleetwood Mac studio album &quot;Say You Will&quot;, in substantially the same form as Buckingham had recorded them for his solo release. Bootleg copies of &quot;Gift of Screws&quot;—taken from an original CD-R presented to Warner Bros and Reprise—are known to exist and have been widely distributed among fans through the use of torrent sites and other peer-to-peer networks.

===2006–2008: Continuing solo===
On his 57th birthday, October 3, 2006, Buckingham&#x27;s fourth solo studio album, an acoustic album now titled &quot;Under the Skin&quot;, was released. &quot;Under the Skin&quot; features Buckingham on almost all instruments, with the exception of two tracks that feature Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s rhythm section of John McVie and Mick Fleetwood. The album includes a cover of the Rolling Stones classic &quot;I Am Waiting&quot;. Three days after the album&#x27;s release, Buckingham embarked on a tour in support of the album that lasted until the end of June 2007. A live album and DVD, &quot;Live at the Bass Performance Hall&quot;, was released documenting the Fort Worth, Texas show from this tour.

In 2008, the &quot;Gift of Screws&quot; album was finally released, containing three tracks from the originally planned studio album, as well as seven new recordings. Buckingham then commenced a short tour to promote &quot;Gift of Screws&quot; in September and October, opening in Saratoga, California and closing in New York City.

===2009: Unleashed Tour===
Fleetwood Mac toured in 2009, with the first date of the &quot;UNLEASHED&quot; Tour as March 1, 2009, in Mellon Arena (Pittsburgh). Christine McVie was not involved with this project.

===2010–2012: &quot;Seeds We Sow&quot; and One Man Show===
On November 3, 2010, Buckingham&#x27;s website announced that he was working on an untitled studio album with release planned in early 2011. Buckingham had finished recording the studio album, titled &quot;Seeds We Sow&quot; in April, and on April 22, 2011, he filmed a concert for DVD release to support the album. &quot;Seeds We Sow&quot; was released on September 6, 2011. On September 10, Buckingham kicked off the &quot;Seeds We Sow&quot; Tour in Reno, Nevada; the tour ended in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on November 14. Buckingham had planned to conduct his first solo tour of the United Kingdom and Ireland in December. However, in early December, Buckingham postponed all UK dates due to his guitarist suffering a back injury. The UK dates were subsequently cancelled.
Buckingham began a &quot;solo&quot; (no backing band) tour of the United States on May 3, 2012, in Solana Beach, California and in November 2012 released a completely solo live album &quot;One Man Show&quot; via digital download at iTunes that was recorded from a single night in Des Moines, Iowa. &quot;One Man Show&quot; was released on Buckingham&#x27;s own label Buckingham Records LLC.

===2013–2015: Fleetwood Mac EP, world tour and Christine McVie reunion===
The &quot;Live World&quot; tour commenced on April 4, 2013, in Columbus, Ohio. On April 30, the band released their first new studio material since 2003&#x27;s &quot;Say You Will&quot; via digital download on iTunes with the four-track EP containing three new songs from Buckingham and one new song from the &quot;Buckingham Nicks&quot; sessions (&quot;Without You&quot;).
Buckingham is credited for three songs on the 2013 release &quot;Hesitation Marks,&quot; the eighth studio album of the band Nine Inch Nails.

On January 11, 2014, Mick Fleetwood announced that Christine McVie was rejoining Fleetwood Mac, and the news was confirmed on January 13 by the band&#x27;s primary publicist, Liz Rosenberg. Rosenberg also stated that an official announcement regarding a new album and tour was forthcoming.

On with the Show, a 33-city North American Tour opened in Minneapolis, Minnesota on September 30, 2014. A series of May–June 2015 arena dates in the United Kingdom went on sale on November 14, selling out in minutes. Additional dates for the tour were added, extending into November.

In January 2015, Buckingham suggested that the new studio album and the new tour might be Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s last act and that the band would cease to operate in 2015 or soon afterward. He concluded: &quot;We&#x27;re going to continue working on the new album, and the solo stuff will take a back seat for a year or two. A beautiful way to wrap up this last act&quot;. On the other hand, Mick Fleetwood stated that the new studio album could take a few years to complete and that they were waiting for contributions from Stevie Nicks, who had been ambivalent about committing to a new record.

===2016–2017: &quot;Lindsey Buckingham Christine McVie&quot; and Classic Concerts===
In August 2016, Fleetwood said that while the band has &quot;a huge amount of recorded music&quot;, virtually none of it featured Stevie Nicks. Buckingham and Christine McVie, however, had contributed multiple songs to the new project. Fleetwood told Ultimate Classic Rock, &quot;She [McVie] ... wrote up a storm ... She and Lindsey could probably have a mighty strong duet album if they want. In truth, I hope it will come to more than that. There really are dozens of songs. And they&#x27;re really good. So we&#x27;ll see.&quot;
Buckingham and Christine McVie announced a collaborative studio album titled &quot;Lindsey Buckingham Christine McVie&quot;, which also features Mick Fleetwood and John McVie. The album was originally planned as a Fleetwood Mac album. Stevie Nicks did not participate due to her preference for a solo tour with the Pretenders. &quot;Lindsey Buckingham/Christine McVie&quot; was released on June 9, 2017, and was preceded by the single, &quot;In My World&quot;. A 38-date tour began on June 21, 2017, and ended on November 16.

===2018–present: Firing from Fleetwood Mac, &quot;Solo Anthology,&quot; and &quot;Lindsey Buckingham&quot;===
Following Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s performance at the MusiCares Person of the Year in January 2018, Buckingham was fired from the band. The reason was said to have been a disagreement about the nature of the tour, and in particular the question of whether newer or less well-known material would be included, as Buckingham wanted.

Mick Fleetwood and the band appeared on &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; on April 25, 2018, and said that Buckingham would not sign off on a tour that the group had been planning for a year and that they had reached a &quot;huge impasse&quot; and &quot;hit a brick wall&quot;. When asked if Buckingham had been fired, he said, &quot;Well, we don&#x27;t use that word because I think it&#x27;s ugly.&quot; He also said that &quot;Lindsey has huge amounts of respect and kudos to what he&#x27;s done within the ranks of Fleetwood Mac and always will.&quot; In October 2018, Buckingham filed a lawsuit against Fleetwood Mac for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of oral contract, and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, among other charges; the lawsuit was settled in December of the same year.

Buckingham stated he learned about the firing after receiving a call from Fleetwood Mac manager Irving Azoff with a message for Buckingham from Stevie Nicks. Buckingham stated that Azoff told him: &quot;Stevie never wants to be on a stage with you again.&quot; According to Azoff, on the evening of MusicCares, just before the band&#x27;s set, Nicks had taken issue with Buckingham’s outburst over the intro music—the studio recording of Nicks&#x27; song &quot;Rhiannon&quot;—and the way he had &quot;smirked&quot; during Nicks&#x27; thank-you speech. Buckingham conceded that &quot;It wasn&#x27;t about it being &#x27;Rhiannon&#x27;. It just undermined the impact of our entrance. That&#x27;s me being very specific about the right and wrong way to do something.&quot; Days later, Buckingham called Azoff and asked, &quot;Is Stevie leaving the band, or am I getting kicked out?&quot; Azoff told him that he was &quot;getting ousted&quot; from the band after Nicks gave the other band members &quot;an ultimatum: Either [Buckingham] go[es] or she&#x27;s going to go,&quot; to which they decided to fire him. Former Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers guitarist Mike Campbell and Neil Finn of Crowded House were named to replace Buckingham. Buckingham has stated since that he would be open to rejoining Fleetwood Mac but does not foresee it in the future.

In August 2018, Reprise issued a press release for a new solo anthology &quot;Solo Anthology: The Best of Lindsey Buckingham&quot; that focused on Buckingham&#x27;s solo career since 1981. The anthology was released on October 5, 2018, followed two days later by a solo tour throughout North America. In 2020, Buckingham collaborated with the Killers on their studio album &quot;Imploding the Mirage&quot;, playing guitar on the first single &quot;Caution&quot;. In 2021, Buckingham played on a new version of &quot;The Past Is the Past&quot; by Brandy Clark, issued as a bonus track on the deluxe edition of her album &quot;Your Life Is a Record&quot;.

On June 8, 2021, Buckingham announced his seventh solo studio album, &quot;Lindsey Buckingham&quot;, with the single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Mind&quot;. The second single from the album, &quot;On the Wrong Side&quot;, was released on July 23, 2021. The record was released on September 17, 2021, and his tour to support it started the same month.

Buckingham also guested on Halsey&#x27;s 2021 studio album &quot;If I Can&#x27;t Have Love, I Want Power&quot;. In 2022, Buckingham would again join with the Killers on August 27, 2022, to perform his guitar solo from &quot;Caution&quot; live on stage in Los Angeles with the band, along with a cover of Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot;. Buckingham along with the Killers were joined with Johnny Marr of the Smiths to perform &quot;Mr. Brightside&quot; together to close out the concert.

==Personal life==
Buckingham was in the same high school as Stevie Nicks but a year behind her. He started a relationship with Nicks after the breakup of their band Fritz. He then suffered from a bout of mononucleosis, which delayed their move to Los Angeles in 1971. They recorded a studio album together before joining Fleetwood Mac in 1975, while their relationship had broken down by 1977. The breakup was chronicled in a number of songs written by the two, such as &quot;Silver Springs&quot; and &quot;Dreams&quot; by Nicks and &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot; and &quot;Second Hand News&quot; by Buckingham.

Buckingham had his first child, William Gregory, with Kristen Messner on July 8, 1998. Buckingham then married Messner in 2000, and they had two daughters, Leelee in 2000 and Stella in 2004. Buckingham and Messner, who is a photographer and interior designer, have developed homes in the Brentwood area of Los Angeles, California.

Buckingham underwent emergency open heart surgery in February 2019. His wife Kristen said that &quot;the life-saving procedure caused vocal cord damage, the permanency of which is unclear&quot;, though he ultimately recovered.

==Musical style==
Unlike most rock guitarists, Buckingham does not play with a pick; instead, he almost exclusively plays fingerstyle and tends to strum with his middle and ring fingers. Initially after joining Fleetwood Mac, Buckingham used a Gibson Les Paul Custom. Before the band, a Fender Telecaster was his main guitar, and was used on his first Fleetwood Mac studio album alongside Fender Stratocasters fitted with an Alembic Blaster. In 1978, he worked with Rick Turner, future owner and founder of The Renaissance Guitar Company, to create the Model One guitar. He has used it extensively since, both with Fleetwood Mac and for his solo efforts. He uses a Taylor Guitar 814ce or a Rick Turner Renaissance RS6 for most of his acoustic performances but uses a custom-made Gibson Chet Atkins guitar for his live performances of &quot;Big Love&quot;. He has also used an Ovation Balladeer in the past from the early 1970s to the late 1980s. In the 1980s, he also extensively used the Fairlight CMI sampling synthesizer.

His influences include Brian Wilson and Phil Spector. Buckingham has also worked extensively as a producer both for Fleetwood Mac and for his solo work. &quot;I think of myself as a stylist, and the process of writing a song is part and parcel with putting it together in the studio.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;Guitar World Acoustic Magazine&quot;, Buckingham said:

I&#x27;ve always believed that you play to highlight the song, not to highlight the player. The song is all that matters. There are two ways you can choose to go. You can try to be someone like Eddie Van Halen, who is a great guitarist, a virtuoso. Yet he doesn&#x27;t make good records because what he plays is totally lost in the context of this band&#x27;s music. Then there are guitar players like Chet Atkins, who weren&#x27;t out there trying to show themselves off as guitarists per se, but were using the guitar as a tool to make good records. I remember loving Chet&#x27;s work when I was a kid, but it was only later, when I really listened to his guitar parts, that I realized how much they were a part of the song&#x27;s fabric, and how much you&#x27;d be going &#x27;Oh, that song just isn&#x27;t working&#x27; if they weren&#x27;t there.

In another interview to &quot;Guitar World&quot;, he said about using his fingers rather than a plectrum:

I started playing very young and from early on, the people I was listening to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And a lot of the session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when you want to get a certain tone. But it&#x27;s just the way I came up. I wasn&#x27;t taught. I just sort of figured things out on my own terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.

==In popular culture==
* Buckingham has been portrayed by Bill Hader in a recurring sketch titled &quot;What Up with That?&quot; on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The show features Hader as Buckingham, who repeatedly appears as a guest on a talk show in the sketch; however, the segment always runs out of time before he can be interviewed. Buckingham has stated he does not understand the parody, though he considers it a compliment, and he eventually appeared as himself on the May 14, 2011 episode during this sketch, offering to explain why there were two Lindsey Buckinghams.
* Buckingham plays himself and sings in episode 3 of the Showtime series &quot;Roadies&quot;.

<text>Christine Anne McVie (; Perfect; 12 July 1943 – 30 November 2022) was an English musician. She was the keyboardist and one of the vocalists and songwriters of the rock band Fleetwood Mac. 

McVie was a member of several bands, notably Chicken Shack, in the mid-1960s British blues scene. She initially began working with Fleetwood Mac as a session player in 1968, before officially joining the band two years later. Her first compositions with Fleetwood Mac appeared on their fifth album, &quot;Future Games&quot;. She remained with the band through many changes of line-up, writing songs and performing lead vocals before partially retiring in 1998.

McVie was described as &quot;the prime mover behind some of Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s biggest hits&quot; and eight songs she wrote or co-wrote, including &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;, &quot;Everywhere&quot; and &quot;Little Lies&quot;, appeared on Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s 1988 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album. She appeared as a session musician on the band&#x27;s last studio album, &quot;Say You Will&quot;. McVie also released three solo studio albums and recorded a duet album with Lindsey Buckingham. McVie was noted for her soulful contralto voice.

As a member of Fleetwood Mac, McVie was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and in 1998 received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In the same year, after almost 30 years with Fleetwood Mac, she left the band and lived in semi-retirement, releasing a solo album in 2004. She appeared on stage with Fleetwood Mac at the O2 Arena in London in September 2013 and rejoined the band in 2014 prior to their On with the Show tour.

McVie received a Gold Badge of Merit Award from BASCA, now The Ivors Academy, in 2006. She received the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors in 2014 and was honoured with the Trailblazer Award at the UK Americana Awards in 2021. She was also the recipient of two Grammy Awards.

==Early life==
Christine Anne Perfect was born on 12 July 1943 in the village of Greenodd, in the Furness area of Lancashire. She grew up in the Bearwood area of Smethwick near Birmingham. Her father, Cyril Percy Absell Perfect, was a concert violinist and music lecturer at St Peter&#x27;s College of Education, Saltley, Birmingham, and taught violin at St Philip&#x27;s Grammar School, Birmingham. Perfect&#x27;s mother, Beatrice Edith Maud (née Reece), was a medium, psychic, and faith healer. Perfect&#x27;s grandfather was an organist at Westminster Abbey.

Perfect was introduced to the piano when she was four, but did not study music seriously until the age of 11, when she was reintroduced to it by a local musician who was a friend of her brother John. She continued classical training to the age of 15, but shifted her musical focus to rock and roll when her brother acquired a Fats Domino songbook. Other early influences included the Everly Brothers.

==Career==
===Early music===
Perfect studied sculpture at Moseley School of Art in Birmingham for five years with the aim of becoming an art teacher, and while at art school, she met budding musicians in Britain&#x27;s blues scene. Her introduction to performing music came when she met guitarist Stan Webb and bass player Andy Silvester, who were in a band called Sounds of Blue. Knowing that Perfect had musical talent, they invited her to join them. She also sang with Spencer Davis. By the time Perfect graduated from art college, Sounds of Blue had split up. She did not have enough money to launch herself into the art world and moved to London, where she worked briefly as a department-store window dresser.

===Chicken Shack===
In 1967, Perfect heard that Silvester and Webb were forming a blues band, to be called Chicken Shack, and were looking for a pianist. She contacted them and was invited to join the band as pianist, keyboard player and backing vocalist. Chicken Shack&#x27;s debut release was &quot;It&#x27;s Okay with Me Baby&quot;, which was written by and featured Perfect. She stayed with the band for two studio albums, and her genuine feel for the blues became evident in her Sonny Thompson-style piano playing and her authentic &quot;bluesy&quot; voice. 

Chicken Shack had a hit with a cover of Ellington Jordan&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Go Blind&quot;, which featured Perfect on lead vocals. Perfect received a &quot;Melody Maker&quot; award for UK&#x27;s best female vocalist in 1969 and again in 1970. She left Chicken Shack in 1969, having married Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie a year earlier, feeling that she would not see her husband if they were in different bands.

=== Fleetwood Mac ===

McVie was a fan of Fleetwood Mac and while she was touring with Chicken Shack the two bands would often meet. Both bands were signed to the Blue Horizon label, and McVie played piano as a session musician on Peter Green&#x27;s songs on Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot;. Encouraged to continue her career, she recorded a debut solo studio album, &quot;Christine Perfect&quot;, which was later reissued as &quot;The Legendary Christine Perfect Album&quot;. She was invited to join Fleetwood Mac as a keyboard player in 1970 after the departure of founding member Peter Green, having already contributed piano and backing vocals, uncredited, to their next album, &quot;Kiln House&quot; and provided the artwork for the sleeve. The band had been struggling to manage without Green and had needed another musician to fill in their sound. McVie had been a huge fan of the Peter Green-era Fleetwood Mac and learned the songs for &quot;Kiln House&quot; during rehearsals.

McVie became an integral member of Fleetwood Mac as keyboard player, songwriter and female lead vocalist. Before she joined there had been talk of the band splitting up, but Fleetwood said later that &quot;Christine became the glue [that held the band together]. She filled out our sound beautifully.&quot; The first studio album on which McVie played as a full band member was &quot;Future Games&quot; in 1971. This was also the first album on which she worked with American guitarist and songwriter Bob Welch, who had replaced founding member Jeremy Spencer.

McVie moved with the rest of Fleetwood Mac to California in 1974, where Welch left after a final album, &quot;Heroes are Hard to Find&quot;, and Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham of Buckingham Nicks joined the band. The line-up now contained two female lead vocalists who also wrote songs. McVie bonded instantly with Nicks and the two women found their voices blended perfectly. McVie wrote and sang lead on four tracks on the first studio album of the new line-up, &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; (1975): &quot;Warm Ways&quot;, &quot;Over My Head&quot;, &quot;Say You Love Me&quot; and &quot;Sugar Daddy&quot;, and had a joint songwriting credit with Buckingham for &quot;World Turning&quot;. The album produced several hit songs, with McVie&#x27;s &quot;Over My Head&quot; and &quot;Say You Love Me&quot; both reaching the &quot;Billboard&quot; top-20 singles chart. &quot;Over My Head&quot; put Fleetwood Mac on American radio and into the national top 20. 

In 1976, McVie began an on-the-road affair with the band&#x27;s lighting director, Curry Grant, which inspired her to write &quot;You Make Loving Fun&quot;, a top-10 hit from their next album, &quot;Rumours&quot; (1977). Her biggest hit from the album was &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;, which reached the top five. &quot;Rumours&quot; also included McVie&#x27;s &quot;Songbird&quot;, a slow ballad which featured McVie playing piano and Buckingham accompanying on acoustic guitar.

By the end of the &quot;Rumours&quot; tour, the McVies were divorced. Christine had a US top-20 hit with &quot;Think About Me&quot; from the 1979 double studio album &quot;Tusk&quot;, which did not match the success of the &quot;Rumours&quot; album. After the &quot;Tusk&quot; tour the band took time apart, reuniting in 1981 to record the studio album &quot;Mirage&quot; at the Château d&#x27;Hérouville&#x27;s studio in France. &quot;Mirage&quot;, released in 1982, returned the band to the top of the US charts and contained the top-five hit &quot;Hold Me&quot;, co-written by McVie. McVie&#x27;s inspiration for the song was her tortured relationship with Beach Boys drummer Dennis Wilson. Her song &quot;Love in Store&quot; became the third single from the album in the United States, peaking at number 22 in early 1983.

McVie&#x27;s second solo studio album, &quot;Christine McVie&quot;, released in 1984, included the hits &quot;Got a Hold on Me&quot; (number 10 US pop, number one adult contemporary and number one Mainstream Rock Tracks) and &quot;Love Will Show Us How&quot; (number 30 US pop). A third single, &quot;I&#x27;m the One&quot;, was released but did not chart. McVie said of the album, &quot;Maybe it isn&#x27;t the most adventurous album in the world, but I wanted to be honest and please my own ears with it.&quot;

McVie married keyboardist Eddy Quintela on 18 October 1986 and they co-wrote songs which featured on subsequent Fleetwood Mac albums. She rejoined Fleetwood Mac in 1987 to record the &quot;Tango in the Night&quot; studio album, which became the band&#x27;s biggest success since &quot;Rumours&quot; and reached the top five in the UK and US. McVie&#x27;s &quot;Little Lies&quot;, co-written with Quintela, was the biggest hit from the album. Another McVie single from the album, &quot;Everywhere&quot;, reached number four in the UK, the band&#x27;s third-highest UK chart peak. The single peaked at number 14 in the U.S. In 1990, the band (now without Buckingham) recorded &quot;Behind the Mask&quot;, which reached Gold status in the US and McVie&#x27;s song &quot;Save Me&quot; made the US top 40. The album entered the UK album chart at number one and reached Platinum status. McVie&#x27;s &quot;Skies the Limit&quot;, the second US single from the album, was a hit on the adult contemporary chart.

McVie&#x27;s father, Cyril Perfect, died in 1990 while she was on the &quot;Behind the Mask&quot; tour and she decided to retire from touring. She remained with the band and wrote and recorded a new track, &quot;Love Shines&quot;, for the 1992 box set &quot;25 Years – The Chain&quot;, and five songs for the 1995 studio album &quot;Time&quot;. Nicks had by now departed. In the mid-90s, Fleetwood and John McVie worked with Buckingham on one of his solo projects and Christine McVie provided vocals and keyboards on some of the tracks. A reunion was proposed, Nicks rejoined the band, and Fleetwood Mac recorded the 1997 live album, &quot;The Dance&quot;, which reached number one on the US album charts. 
McVie returned to touring and performed for the group&#x27;s 1998 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as well as the Grammy Awards show and the Brit Awards in the UK. She decided not to continue with Fleetwood Mac after 1998 and said this was because she had developed a phobia about flying.

==== 1999–2014: Hiatus from Fleetwood Mac and semi-retirement ====
After &quot;The Dance&quot;, McVie returned to England to be near her family and stayed out of public view until 2000, when she accepted an honorary doctorate in music from the University of Greenwich. Five years after McVie left Fleetwood Mac, she and Quintela were divorced.

In a 2004 interview, McVie admitted to not listening much to pop music any more and stated instead a preference for Classic FM. She appeared as a session musician on the band&#x27;s last studio album, &quot;Say You Will&quot;. In December 2003 she went to see Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s last UK performance on the Say You Will tour in London, but did not join her former bandmates on stage. She released her third solo studio album, &quot;In the Meantime&quot;, that year.

McVie was awarded the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors&#x27; Gold Badge of Merit at a ceremony held at London&#x27;s Savoy Hotel in 2006. That same year, &quot;Paste&quot; named McVie, together with bandmates Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks, as the 83rd-greatest living songwriter or songwriting team. McVie did not join her former bandmates on the band&#x27;s last performance in the UK of the &quot;Unleashed&quot; tour in November 2009. When Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s 2012 world tour was announced, Stevie Nicks downplayed the likelihood of McVie ever rejoining the group. Nicks said, &quot;She went to England and she has never been back since 1998 [...] as much as we would all like to think that she&#x27;ll just change her mind one day, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll happen [...] We love her, so we had to let her go.&quot;

In October 2013, it was announced that McVie was recording a solo studio album for the first time in nine years. The album was never released.

==== 2014–2022: Return to Fleetwood Mac and album with Lindsey Buckingham ====

In 2013, McVie appeared on stage in Maui, Hawaii, performing with the Mick Fleetwood Blues Band, which included Mick Fleetwood and ex-Fleetwood Mac guitarist Rick Vito. This was her first appearance on stage in 15 years. Later in September, Christine McVie joined Fleetwood Mac on stage for the first time in 15 years to play &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot; at the O2 Arena in London. She played on two dates, and her appearance on stage was received with rapturous applause.

On 11 January 2014, Mick Fleetwood announced during a concert in Maui that McVie would be rejoining the band, and it was officially announced two days later that she had rejoined.

In August 2016, Mick Fleetwood said that while the band had &quot;a huge amount of recorded music&quot;, virtually none of it featured Stevie Nicks. Buckingham and McVie, however, have contributed numerous songs to the new project. Fleetwood told Ultimate Classic Rock, &quot;She [McVie] ... wrote up a storm ... She and Lindsey could probably have a mighty strong duet album if they want. In truth, I hope it will come to more than that. There really are dozens of songs. And they&#x27;re really good. So we&#x27;ll see.&quot;

The collaborative studio album &quot;Lindsey Buckingham Christine McVie&quot; was released on 9 June 2017, and was preceded by the single, &quot;In My World&quot;. A 38-date tour began on 21 June 2017 and ended on 16 November. Eight of the album&#x27;s ten tracks were played live, with the rest of the set list consisting of Fleetwood Mac songs and Buckingham solo cuts. The Wallflowers opened for the band on select nights. In June, the band appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; to perform the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;In My World&quot;. Some extra North American shows were later added in August, including one in Los Angeles and another in New York City. Another North American leg began in October, which saw the addition of 22 more shows.

Fleetwood Mac headlined the second night of the Classic West concert, on 16 July 2017 at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, and the second night of the Classic East concert at New York City&#x27;s Citi Field on 30 July 2017. On 9 April 2018, Fleetwood Mac announced that Mike Campbell would be joining the band along with Neil Finn to replace lead guitarist Lindsey Buckingham. In 2019, McVie was featured in the 90-minute BBC documentary &quot;Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s Songbird – Christine McVie&quot;, directed by Matt O&#x27;Casey. In 2022, a compilation album titled &quot;Songbird (A Solo Collection)&quot; was released.

===Other collaborations===
McVie sang with Christopher Cross on the song &quot;Never Stop Believing&quot; on his 1988 studio album &quot;Back of My Mind&quot; as well as with Bob Welch on his solo version of &quot;Sentimental Lady&quot;.

== Personal life ==
McVie married John McVie in 1968, with Peter Green as best man. Instead of a honeymoon, they celebrated at a hotel in Birmingham with Joe Cocker, who happened to be staying there, before going on the road with their own bands. The couple divorced in 1976, but remained friends and maintained a professional partnership. During the production of &quot;Rumours&quot;, Christine had an affair with Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s lighting engineer, Curry Grant, which inspired the song &quot;You Make Loving Fun&quot;. From 1979 to 1982, she dated Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys. McVie married Portuguese keyboardist and songwriter Eddy Quintela on 18 October 1986. Quintela and McVie collaborated on a number of songs together, including &quot;Little Lies&quot;. They divorced in 2003, and Quintela died in 2020.

During the height of Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s success in the 1970s, McVie resided in Los Angeles. In 1990, she moved to a Grade II-listed Tudor manor house in Wickhambreaux, near Canterbury in Kent, to which she retired after leaving the band in 1998, and worked on her solo material. For years McVie found inspiration in the home&#x27;s country setting, not only writing songs there, but also restoring the house. After rejoining Fleetwood Mac in 2014, she began spending more time in London, and put the house on the market in 2015.

== Death ==
McVie died of a stroke in hospital on 30 November 2022, at the age of 79. She had also been suffering from metastatic cancer of unknown primary origin.

Following her death, Fleetwood Mac issued a statement saying that she was &quot;the best musician anyone could have in their band and the best friend anyone could have in their life&quot;. Stevie Nicks said McVie had been her &quot;best friend in the whole world&quot;.

<text>Stephanie Lynn Nicks (born May 26, 1948) is an American singer-songwriter, known for her work with the band Fleetwood Mac and as a solo artist.

After starting her career as a duo with her then-boyfriend Lindsey Buckingham, releasing the album &quot;Buckingham Nicks&quot; to little success, Nicks joined Fleetwood Mac in 1975, helping the band to become one of the best-selling music acts of all time with over 120 million records sold worldwide. &quot;Rumours&quot;, the band&#x27;s second album with Nicks, became one of the best-selling albums worldwide, being certified 20× platinum in the US. In 1981, while remaining a member of Fleetwood Mac, Nicks began her solo career, releasing the studio album &quot;Bella Donna&quot;, which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and has reached multiplatinum status. She has released eight studio albums as a solo artist and seven with Fleetwood Mac, selling a certified total of 65 million copies in the U.S. alone.

After the release of her first solo album, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named her the &quot;Reigning Queen of Rock and Roll&quot;. Nicks was named one of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time and one of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Her Fleetwood Mac songs &quot;Landslide&quot;, &quot;Rhiannon&quot;, and &quot;Dreams&quot;, with the last being the band&#x27;s only number one hit in the U.S., together with her solo hit &quot;Edge of Seventeen&quot;, have all been included in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. She is the first woman to have been inducted twice into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: first as a member of Fleetwood Mac in 1998 and then as a solo artist in 2019.

Nicks has garnered eight Grammy Award nominations and two American Music Award nominations as a solo artist. She has won numerous awards with Fleetwood Mac, including a Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1978 for &quot;Rumours&quot;. The albums &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot;, &quot;Rumours&quot;, and &quot;Bella Donna&quot; have been included in the &quot;Greatest of All Time &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Albums&quot; chart by &quot;Billboard&quot;. &quot;Rumours&quot; was also rated the seventh-greatest album of all time in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, as well as the fourth-greatest album by female acts.

== Life and career ==

=== 1948–1971: Early life and career beginnings ===
Stephanie Lynn &quot;Stevie&quot; Nicks was born at Good Samaritan Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona to Jess and Barbara Nicks. Nicks is of German, English, Welsh, and Irish ancestry.

Nicks&#x27;s grandfather, Aaron Jess &quot;A.J.&quot; Nicks Sr., taught Nicks to sing duets with him by the time she was four years old. Nicks&#x27;s mother was protective, keeping her at home &quot;more than most people&quot; and fostered in her daughter a love of fairy tales.

As a toddler, Stephanie could only pronounce her name as &quot;tee-dee&quot;, which led to her nickname of &quot;Stevie&quot;.

Her father&#x27;s frequent relocation as a vice president of Greyhound had the family living in Phoenix, Albuquerque, El Paso, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. With the Goya guitar that she received for her 16th birthday, Nicks wrote her first song, titled &quot;I&#x27;ve Loved and I&#x27;ve Lost, and I&#x27;m Sad but Not Blue&quot;. She spent her adolescence playing records constantly and lived in her &quot;own little musical world&quot;.

While attending Arcadia High School in Arcadia, California, she joined her first band, the Changing Times, a folk rock band focused on vocal harmonies.

Nicks met her future musical and romantic partner, Lindsey Buckingham, during her senior year at Menlo-Atherton High School in Atherton, California. When she saw Buckingham playing &quot;California Dreamin&#x27;&quot; at the Young Life club, she joined him in harmony. She recalled, &quot;I thought he was a darling.&quot; Buckingham was in psychedelic rock band Fritz, but two of its musicians were leaving for college. He asked Nicks, in mid-1967, to replace the lead singer. Fritz later opened for Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin from 1968 until 1970. Nicks credits both acts as inspiring her stage intensity and performance.

Nicks and Buckingham attended San José State University, where Nicks majored in speech communication and planned to become an English teacher. With her father&#x27;s blessing, she dropped out of college to pursue a musical career with Buckingham.

=== 1972–1978: &quot;Buckingham Nicks&quot; and &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; ===
After Fritz disbanded in 1972, Nicks and Buckingham continued to write as a duo, recording demo tapes at night in Daly City, California, on a one-inch, four-track Ampex tape machine Buckingham kept at the coffee-roasting plant belonging to his father. They secured a deal with Polydor Records, and the eponymous &quot;Buckingham Nicks&quot; was released in 1973. The album was not a commercial success and Polydor dropped the pair.

With no money coming in from their album, and Buckingham contracting mononucleosis shortly thereafter, Nicks began working multiple jobs. She waited tables and cleaned producer Keith Olsen&#x27;s house, where Nicks and Buckingham lived for a time before moving in with Richard Dashut. She soon started using cocaine. &quot;We were told that it was recreational and that it was not dangerous,&quot; Nicks told Chris Isaak in 2009.

While living with Dashut, Buckingham landed a guitar role with the Everly Brothers 1972 tour. Nicks stayed behind working on songwriting herself. During this time, Nicks wrote &quot;Rhiannon&quot; after seeing the name in the novel &quot;Triad&quot; by Mary Leader. (Five years later, a fan sent her the Mabinogion novels of Evangeline Walton that featured the legendary character Rhiannon, and Nicks later bought the film rights to Walton&#x27;s work in the hopes of bringing the epic to the screen.) She also wrote &quot;Landslide&quot;, inspired by the scenery of Aspen and her slowly deteriorating relationship with Buckingham.

In late 1974, Keith Olsen played the Buckingham Nicks track &quot;Frozen Love&quot; for drummer Mick Fleetwood, who had come to Sound City in California in search of a recording studio. Fleetwood remembered Buckingham&#x27;s guitar work when guitarist Bob Welch departed to pursue a solo career. On December 31, 1974, Fleetwood called Buckingham, inviting him to join the band. Buckingham refused, insisting that Nicks and he were &quot;a package deal&quot; and he would not join without her. The group decided that incorporating the pair would improve Fleetwood Mac. The first rehearsals confirmed this feeling, with the harmonies of the newcomers adding a pop accessibility to the band&#x27;s former style of blues-based rock.
In 1975, Fleetwood Mac achieved worldwide success with the album &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot;. Nicks&#x27;s &quot;Rhiannon&quot; was voted one of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Her live performances of the song throughout the decade began to take on a theatrical intensity which differs from how the song plays on the album. The song built to a climax in which Nicks&#x27;s vocals were so impassioned that Mick Fleetwood declared, &quot;her &#x27;Rhiannon&#x27; in those days was like an exorcism.&quot; &quot;Landslide&quot; became another hit from the album, with three million airplays.

Becoming aware of her image as a performer, Nicks worked with clothing designer Margi Kent to develop a unique onstage look. Her costumes had a bohemian style that featured flowing skirts, shawls, and platform boots.

While Nicks and Buckingham achieved professional success with &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot;, their personal relationship was eroding. Nicks ended the relationship. Fleetwood Mac began recording their follow-up album, &quot;Rumours&quot;, in early 1976 and continued until late in the year. Also, Nicks and Buckingham sang back-up on Warren Zevon&#x27;s eponymous second album.

Among Nicks&#x27;s contributions to &quot;Rumours&quot; was &quot;Dreams&quot;, which became the band&#x27;s only &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one hit single. Nicks had also written and recorded the song &quot;Silver Springs&quot;, but it was not included on the album because the early versions of the song ran too long, and the band didn&#x27;t want too many slow songs on the album. Studio engineer and co-producer Ken Caillat said that Nicks was very unhappy to find that the band had decided against her song &quot;Silver Springs&quot;, which he said was beautifully crafted, and carried some of the band&#x27;s best guitar work. &quot;Silver Springs&quot;, written about her tumultuous relationship with Buckingham, was released as a B-side of the &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot; single—Buckingham&#x27;s equally critical song about Nicks. Copies of the single eventually became collectors&#x27; items among fans of Fleetwood Mac. &quot;Silver Springs&quot; was included on the four-disc Fleetwood Mac retrospective &quot;25 Years – The Chain&quot; in 1992.

&quot;Rumours&quot;, Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s second album after the incorporation of Nicks and Buckingham, was the best-selling album of 1977 and had sold over 45 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. The album remained at number one on the American albums chart for 31 weeks and reached number one in other countries. The album won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1978. It produced four U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top-ten singles, including Nicks&#x27;s &quot;Dreams&quot;.

In November 1977, after a New Zealand concert on the &quot;Rumours&quot; tour, Nicks and Fleetwood secretly began an affair. Fleetwood was married to Jenny Boyd. &quot;Never in a million years could you have told me that would happen,&quot; Nicks has stated. &quot;Everybody was angry because Mick was married to a wonderful girl and had two wonderful children. I was horrified. I loved these people. I loved his family. So, it couldn&#x27;t possibly work out. And it didn&#x27;t. I just couldn&#x27;t.&quot; Nicks ended the affair soon after it began. She has stated that had the affair progressed, it &quot;would have been the end of Fleetwood Mac&quot;. By October 1978, Mick Fleetwood left Boyd for Nicks&#x27;s friend Sara Recor.

=== 1979–1982: &quot;Tusk&quot; and &quot;Mirage&quot; ===

After the success of the &quot;Rumours&quot; album and tour in 1977 to 1978, Fleetwood Mac began recording their third album with Nicks and Buckingham, &quot;Tusk&quot;, in the spring of 1978. By this time, Nicks had amassed a large backlog of songs that she had been unable to record with Fleetwood Mac because of the constraint of having to accommodate three songwriters on each album. &quot;Tusk&quot; was released on October 19, 1979. &quot;Mirage&quot; was recorded in late 1981 and early 1982.

=== Backup vocals and duets ===
While working on &quot;Tusk&quot;, Nicks sang backup on virtually every track of &quot;Not Shy&quot;, recorded by musician Walter Egan, a friend of both Nicks and Buckingham. &quot;Magnet and Steel&quot;, inspired by Nicks, prominently featured her backup vocals and became a hit single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart during the summer of 1978. Lindsey Buckingham also produced the album, playing guitar and providing backing vocals on some of the tracks. Nicks recorded the hit duets &quot;Whenever I Call You Friend&quot; with Kenny Loggins in 1978, and &quot;Gold&quot; with John Stewart in 1979. During 1981, Nicks made occasional guest appearances with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers on their &quot;Hard Promises&quot; tour.

=== Solo career ===
Nicks wrote and recorded demos for a solo project during &quot;Tusk&quot; sessions in 1979 and the &quot;Tusk&quot; world tour of 1979–80. Nicks, Danny Goldberg, and Paul Fishkin founded Modern Records to record and release Nicks&#x27;s material.

Nicks&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Bella Donna&quot;, was released on July 27, 1981, to critical and commercial acclaim, reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, with four singles making the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; deeming her &quot;the Reigning Queen of Rock and Roll&quot;.

The day that &quot;Bella Donna&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, Nicks was told that her friend Robin Anderson had leukemia. Anderson was pregnant at the time and given only three months to live. She gave birth to a son, appointing Nicks as the child&#x27;s godmother. &quot;I never got to enjoy &quot;Bella Donna&quot; at all because my friend was dying. Something went out that day; something left.&quot; Following Robin&#x27;s death in 1982, Nicks married Robin&#x27;s widower, Kim Anderson, believing that Robin would want her to care for the baby. &quot;We were all in such insane grief, just completely deranged,&quot; she told the &quot;Telegraph&quot; in 2007. They divorced three months later.

&quot;Bella Donna&quot; introduced Nicks&#x27;s permanent back-up singers, Sharon Celani and Lori Perry (now Nicks after marrying Stevie&#x27;s brother Christopher), who have contributed vocals to all of Nicks&#x27;s solo albums since then. In November 1981, Nicks embarked on her &quot;White Winged Dove&quot; tour, which she had to cut short to record &quot;Mirage&quot;.

Nicks released her second solo album, &quot;The Wild Heart&quot;, on June 10, 1983. The album went double platinum, reached number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart, and featured three hit singles. It also introduced songwriter and performer Sandy Stewart as co-writer and vocalist.

Nicks performed at the second US Festival at Glen Helen Regional Park in San Bernardino, California, and later toured the U.S. from June 1983 to November 1983. Nicks appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in December 1983, performing &quot;Stand Back&quot; and &quot;Nightbird&quot;.

Following the tour for &quot;The Wild Heart&quot;, Nicks commenced work on her third solo album. Originally titled &quot;Mirror Mirror&quot;, Nicks recorded songs for the album during 1984. However, Nicks was unhappy with the album, and opted to record a new batch of songs in 1985. &quot;Rock a Little&quot;, as it was retitled, was released November 18, 1985, to commercial success, supported by three successful singles. Nicks toured for &quot;Rock a Little&quot; until October 1986, and performed with Bob Dylan and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers during their tour in Australia.

The tour marked a turning point in Nicks&#x27;s life. The January before the tour was to begin, a plastic surgeon warned her of severe health problems if she did not stop using cocaine. &quot;I said, &#x27;What do you think about my nose?, she recalled on &quot;The Chris Isaak Hour&quot; in 2009. &quot;And he said, &#x27;Well, I think the next time you do a hit of cocaine, you could drop dead. At the end of the Australian tour, Nicks checked herself into the Betty Ford Center for 30 days to overcome her cocaine addiction. Recalling the strong influence of Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix on her music and life, she told a UK interviewer, &quot;I saw how they went down, and a part of me wanted to go down with them ... but then another part of me thought, I would be very sad if some 25-year-old lady rock and roll singer ten years from now said, &#x27;I wish Stevie Nicks would have thought about it a little more.&#x27; That&#x27;s kind of what stopped me and made me really look at the world through clear eyes.&quot;

Later that year, on the advice of friends concerned that she might relapse, she visited a psychiatrist who prescribed the sedative Klonopin to help her remain free from cocaine.

=== 1987–1990: &quot;Tango in the Night&quot;, &quot;The Other Side of the Mirror&quot;, and &quot;Behind the Mask&quot; ===
In late 1985, Fleetwood Mac began work on &quot;Tango in the Night&quot;, but due to her promotional schedule for the &quot;Rock a Little&quot; album and subsequent tour, Nicks was mostly unavailable to work on the album with the band except for a few weeks following her stay at the Betty Ford Center in 1986 (which was the inspiration for the song &quot;Welcome to the Room...Sara&quot;). She sent the band demos of her songs to work on in her absence. The album was released in April 1987 and became the band&#x27;s second-highest selling album, behind &quot;Rumours&quot;.

Creative differences and unresolved personal issues within the band led Buckingham to quit the group right before their world tour. According to bassist John McVie, a &quot;physically ugly&quot; confrontation between Nicks and Buckingham ensued when Nicks angrily challenged Buckingham&#x27;s decision to leave the band.

The band embarked on the &quot;Shake the Cage&quot; tour in September 1987, with Buckingham replaced by Rick Vito and Billy Burnette. The tour was suspended while Nicks suffered from myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and developed an addiction to Klonopin, though it resumed in 1988. &quot;Tango in the Night&quot; met with commercial success and was followed by Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album in November 1988.

Also in 1988, Nicks began work on a fourth solo album with English record producer Rupert Hine. &quot;The Other Side of the Mirror&quot; was released on May 11, 1989, to commercial success. Nicks became romantically involved with Hine.

Nicks toured the U.S. and Europe from August to November 1989. She later said she had &quot;no memory of this tour&quot; because of her increasing dependency on Klonopin, prescribed in ever increasing amounts by a psychiatrist between 1987 and 1994, in an attempt to keep Nicks from regressing to her former abuse of cocaine.

In 1989, Nicks set to work with Fleetwood Mac on &quot;Behind the Mask&quot;, released in 1990 to moderate commercial success in the U.S. In the UK, however, the album entered the chart at number one and was certified platinum. The band went on a world tour to promote the album, on the last night of which Buckingham and Nicks reunited on stage to perform &quot;Landslide&quot;. After the tour concluded, Nicks left the group over a dispute with Mick Fleetwood, who would not allow her to release the 1977 track &quot;Silver Springs&quot; on her album &quot;&quot;, because of his plans to save it for release on a forthcoming Fleetwood Mac box set. Fleetwood knew that the song would be valuable as a selling point for the box set, since over the years, it had gained interest among the band&#x27;s fans.

=== 1991–1996: &quot;Timespace&quot; and &quot;Street Angel&quot; ===
On the 10th anniversary of her solo career debut, Nicks released &quot;Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks&quot; on September 3, 1991. The following year, Fleetwood Mac also released a four-disc box set, &quot;25 Years – The Chain&quot;, which included &quot;Silver Springs&quot;.

During the 1992 U.S. presidential campaign, Bill Clinton used the Fleetwood Mac hit &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot; as his campaign theme song, and Nicks rejoined the classic &quot;Rumours&quot; lineup of the band (including Buckingham) to perform the song at Clinton&#x27;s 1993 inaugural gala. No plans for an official reunion were made at that time. Nicks was criticized for her weight gain. Nicks, who is , had gained weight, peaking at 175 lbs (79.4 kg). &quot;Klonopin was worse than the cocaine,&quot; she has said. &quot;I lost those 8 years of my life. I didn&#x27;t write, and I had gained so much weight.&quot;

In late 1993, while Nicks held a baby shower at her house, she tripped over a box, passed out, and cut her forehead near a fireplace. &quot;I&#x27;m one of those people who doesn&#x27;t injure themselves. I was horrified to see that blood. I hadn&#x27;t had enough wine. I knew it was the Klonopin,&quot; she said. Realizing that she needed help, Nicks endured a painful 47-day detox in a hospital.

Following her successful detox, Nicks released her fifth solo album, &quot;Street Angel&quot;, recorded during 1992 and 1993 using material written mostly in previous years. Released on May 23, 1994, &quot;Street Angel&quot; was poorly received, reaching number 45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200. Nicks has since expressed major disappointment with the album, claiming that a lot of its production work took place during her second stint in rehab, meaning she had little or no say over the final product.

Despite a three-month tour in support of the album, Nicks was crushed by the focus on her weight and the poor reception of the album. Disgusted by the criticism she received during the tour for being overweight, she vowed to never set foot on a stage again unless she slimmed down.

In 1996, Nicks reunited with Lindsey Buckingham and contributed the duet &quot;Twisted&quot; to the &quot;Twister&quot; movie soundtrack, while in 1996, the Sheryl Crow-penned &quot;Somebody Stand by Me&quot; featured on the &quot;Boys on the Side&quot; soundtrack, and Nicks also remade Tom Petty&#x27;s &quot;Free Fallin&#x27;&quot; for Fox&#x27;s TV hit &quot;Party of Five&quot;.

=== 1997–2001: &quot;The Dance&quot;, &quot;Enchanted&quot;, and &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La&quot; ===
In 1996, Lindsey Buckingham, working on a planned solo album, enlisted the help of Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, which eventually led to a reunion of the entire band. A newly invigorated Nicks joined Fleetwood Mac for &quot;The Dance&quot;, a highly successful 1997 tour that coincided with the 20th anniversary of the release of &quot;Rumours&quot;. Prior to the tour, Nicks started work with a voice coach, to lend her voice more control and protect it from the stress of lengthy touring schedules. She also went on a diet and started jogging to lose weight.

The band&#x27;s live CD &quot;The Dance&quot; was released to commercial and critical acclaim. &quot;The Dance&quot; earned the group several Grammy nominations, including a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for their live performance of &quot;Silver Springs&quot;. In 1998, Nicks joined the group for its induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. That same year, Fleetwood Mac was awarded the Outstanding Contribution at the BRIT Awards.

Nicks put work on a new solo album on hold when she was approached by Warner Music to release a solo career-spanning box set, to finish her contract with Atlantic Records in the U.S. After the culmination of the Fleetwood Mac reunion tour, Nicks settled down in Los Angeles and Phoenix with close friends and colleagues to devise a track list for this three-disc collection.

The box set &quot;Enchanted&quot; was released to acclaim on April 28, 1998, with liner notes from Nicks, as well as exclusive rare photographs, and pages from her journals. Nicks supported the box set with a successful U.S. tour. In 1998, Nicks contributed to the &quot;Practical Magic&quot; soundtrack and performed in Don Henley&#x27;s benefit concert for the Walden Woods Project.

Nicks had begun writing actively for &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La&quot; in 1994 and 1995 as she came out of her Klonopin dependency. According to her, friend and former musical partner Tom Petty was responsible for convincing her to write music again when he rebuffed her request that he write a song with her. She resumed recording songs for the &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La&quot; album with Sheryl Crow, who produced and performed on several tracks. When a scheduling conflict forced Crow to drop out of the project, Nicks first approached R&amp;B producer Dallas Austin, but these sessions have never surfaced. Nicks finally called on John Shanks to produce the remainder of the album, with additional contributions from David Kahne, Rick Nowels, Pierre Marchand, and Jeff Trott. Artists Natalie Maines, Sarah McLachlan, and Macy Gray contributed to some of the tracks.

Released May 1, 2001, &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La&quot; restored Nicks&#x27;s solo career to critical and commercial success. &quot;Planets of the Universe&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, and Nicks was named VH1&#x27;s &quot;Artist of the Month&quot; for May 2001. Nicks was named one of &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s 50 Most Beautiful People, was featured in a well-received &quot;Behind the Music&quot; episode, and performed an episode of the VH1 Storytellers Concert Program. Nicks made several television appearances in support of the album and performed at the 2001 Radio Music Awards.

Nicks supported the album with a successful tour, although some shows were canceled or postponed because of her bout with acute bronchitis. Shows were also canceled because of the September 11 attacks in the U.S.

=== 2002–2009: &quot;Say You Will&quot;, &quot;Crystal Visions&quot;, and &quot;Soundstage Sessions&quot; ===
In 2001, Fleetwood Mac began work on a new studio album, though this time without Christine McVie, leaving Nicks as the sole woman in the band for the first time. After the end of her solo tour, Nicks convened with the other members of the band for recording a new album, &quot;Say You Will&quot;, which was released in April 2003 and met with commercial success but mixed reviews. Nicks joined the group to support the album with a world tour lasting until September 2004.

She has subsequently stated in several interviews that she was not happy with the album or the successful world tour that followed, citing production disputes with Buckingham as a core factor, as well as the absence of fellow female band member Christine McVie. A documentary of the making of the album, &quot;Destiny Rules&quot;, was released on DVD in 2004 and chronicles the sometimes-turbulent relationships between band members, especially Buckingham and Nicks, during that time in the studio.

After a few months&#x27; respite from the &quot;Say You Will&quot; tour, Nicks did a four-night stint in May 2005 at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, and then did 10 shows with Don Henley dubbed the &quot;Two Voices&quot; tour. During the summer of 2005, Nicks continued doing solo shows (&quot;Gold Dust&quot; tour) with pop singer Vanessa Carlton as the opening act, playing over 20 dates nationwide.
On March 27, 2007, Reprise Records released &quot;Crystal Visions – The Very Best of Stevie Nicks&quot; in the U.S. The album debuted at number 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart.

The compilation includes her hit singles, a dance remix, and one new track, a live version of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Rock and Roll&quot;. Two versions of this album were made, one with just the audio CD and a deluxe version which includes a DVD featuring all of Nicks&#x27;s music videos with audio commentary from Nicks herself, as well as rare footage from the &quot;Bella Donna&quot; recording sessions.

A tour with Chris Isaak, opening in Concord, California on May 17, 2007, supported the release.

Reprise Records initially released two radio-only promos, the live version of &quot;Landslide&quot; with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra and &quot;Rock and Roll&quot;. Both tracks failed to garner much airplay and made no impact on the charts. Reprise Records released &quot;Stand Back&quot; (issued with club mixes) on May 29, 2007. &quot;Stand Back&quot;, which peaked at number five on the pop singles chart in 1983, reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Club chart. Nicks previously reached number one on this chart, with &quot;Planets of the Universe&quot; (from &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La&quot;) in 2001. The remix single of &quot;Stand Back&quot; debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Singles Sales chart on September 15, 2007, at number 10, peaking at number four the following week. It also debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Singles Sales chart at number three, later peaking at number one.

On March 31, 2009, Nicks released the album, &quot;The Soundstage Sessions&quot;, via Reprise Records. The album debuted at number 47 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. The first single from the album, &quot;Crash into Me&quot;, was released as a digital download, along with &quot;Landslide&quot; (orchestra version) as a B-side, on March 17, 2009.

In late 2008, Fleetwood Mac announced that the band would tour in 2009, beginning in March. As per the 2003–2004 tour, Christine McVie would not be featured in the lineup. The tour was branded as a &#x27;greatest hits&#x27; show titled &quot;Unleashed&quot;, although they played album tracks such as &quot;Storms&quot; and &quot;I Know I&#x27;m Not Wrong&quot;.

=== 2010–2013: &quot;In Your Dreams&quot; and Extended Play Tour ===
After completing the &quot;Unleashed&quot; tour with Fleetwood Mac, Nicks began work on her first solo album in a decade with David A. Stewart, a musician and record producer best known for being one half of the duo Eurythmics.

Nicks performed in a series of shows in August 2010 (&quot;it&#x27;s not really a tour&quot;, she said). They did not contain any of her new music, because she did not want it to end up on YouTube. The Santa Barbara show benefited a young girl she had met through the Make-a-Wish Foundation in Los Angeles with rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare cancer.

On January 13, 2011, Reprise announced Nicks&#x27;s upcoming album &quot;In Your Dreams&quot; would be released on May 3, and the lead single, &quot;Secret Love&quot;, would be released on February 8. Reprise provided a free download of the single to fans who ordered the album via certain websites. Nicks originally wrote &quot;Secret Love&quot; in 1976 and recorded a demo of it for Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s 1977 album, &quot;Rumours&quot;. It did not make the final cut for the album. The demo version had been circulating among fans for many years prior to its inclusion on &quot;In Your Dreams&quot;. Nicks promoted the song with a video directed by Dave Stewart. Nicks&#x27;s goddaughter Kelly appears in the video wearing a vintage dress that Nicks wore on stage in 1976. According to Nicks, Kelly portrays the young Nicks blending with the soul of Nicks&#x27;s 62-year-old self. On the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, &quot;Secret Love&quot; was a modest hit on the Adult Contemporary Singles chart, peaking at number 20, and at number 25 on the Triple-A Singles chart. Another song on the album, &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot;, features Nicks&#x27;s niece in the video. The song reached number 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart in September 2011. A documentary film was made for the album, directed by Stewart. The documentary was critically acclaimed, and Nicks appeared at many film festivals to support the documentary.

Nicks promoted the album with appearances on various television shows, including &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, &quot;The X Factor&quot;, &quot;The Talk&quot;, &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;, &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;. and &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;.

&quot;In Your Dreams&quot; was well received by music critics. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commented, &quot;It&#x27;s not just her first album in 10 years, it&#x27;s her finest collection of songs since the Eighties&quot;. The album debuted at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, giving Nicks her fifth top-10 album on that chart, with 52,000 copies sold in the first week. Elsewhere, the album has made numerous top-50 debuts, including number 24 on the Australian ARIA chart, number 22 in Canada, and number 14 in the UK.

The same day that Nicks&#x27;s new album was released, Fox Network broadcast the &quot;Glee&quot; episode (Season 2, Episode 19) &quot;Rumours&quot; that featured six songs from Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s 1977 album, including Nicks&#x27;s song &quot;Dreams&quot; (the band&#x27;s only number-one song on the U.S. charts). The show sparked renewed interest in the band and its most commercially successful album, and &quot;Rumours&quot; re-entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at number 11, the same week that &quot;In Your Dreams&quot; debuted at number six. Nicks was quoted by &quot;Billboard&quot; saying that her new album was &quot;my own little &quot;Rumours&quot;&quot;.

Nicks contributed a cover of Buddy Holly&#x27;s &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; for the tribute album &quot;Listen to Me: Buddy Holly&quot;, released in September 2011.

On March 29, 2012, Nicks made a guest appearance as herself on the NBC sitcom &quot;Up All Night&quot;. The show featured an excerpt of the 1981 track &quot;Sleeping Angel&quot;, as well as new duets with both Maya Rudolph and Christina Applegate of &quot;Whenever I Call You Friend&quot; and &quot;Edge of Seventeen&quot;.

On December 14, 2012, it was announced that Nicks would be featured on an original track done in collaboration with Dave Grohl for his Sound City soundtrack, alongside other artists.

In 2013, Fleetwood Mac toured again as a four-piece band throughout North America and Europe. On April 30, the band released their first new studio material since 2003&#x27;s &quot;Say You Will&quot; via digital download on iTunes with the four-track EP, &quot;Extended Play&quot; containing three new songs and one new song from the Buckingham Nicks sessions (&quot;Without You&quot;).

On December 3, 2013, Nicks released the &quot;In Your Dreams&quot; documentary film on DVD. The DVD debuted at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Music Video sales chart and number 29 on the UK Music Video Top 40 chart.

=== Since 2014: &quot;24 Karat Gold: Songs from the Vault&quot; and future endeavors ===

In 2014, Nicks appeared on the third season of television series &quot;American Horror Story&quot;, &quot;Coven&quot;, in a role she reprised in the eighth season, &quot;American Horror Story: Apocalypse&quot;. She played a fictional version of herself, portraying a &quot;white witch&quot; with supernatural powers in three episodes. On the show, she performed the songs &quot;Rhiannon&quot;, &quot;Has Anyone Ever Written Anything for You?&quot;, &quot;Seven Wonders&quot;, and &quot;Gypsy&quot;.

&quot;I said &#x27;That&#x27;s perfect,&#x27;&quot; she told &quot;Us&quot; magazine in response to the show&#x27;s music request. &quot;Because that&#x27;s exactly how I like to affect people. I want people to put my songs on because they are unhappy and need a boost to dance around their apartment a little and feel good. That&#x27;s why I write. &#x27;Of course, you can use my music. Take it!&#x27;&quot; In May 2014, Nicks was honored with a BMI Icon Award. In July 2014, it was announced that Nicks would join &quot;The Voice&quot; as the adviser for Adam Levine&#x27;s team.

In September 2014, Nicks released her eighth studio album, &quot;24 Karat Gold: Songs from the Vault&quot;, which reached number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. She also began a North American tour with Fleetwood Mac, now reunited with Christine McVie, the On with the Show tour. The tour began in September 2014 and concluded in November 2015.

In May 2015, Nicks reissued &quot;Crystal Visions – The Very Best of Stevie Nicks&quot; on &quot;crystal clear&quot; transparent double vinyl. The vinyl came with a vinyl messenger bag and a limited-edition lithograph. Throughout 2016 and 2017, Nicks toured with The Pretenders on the 24 Karat Gold Tour.

On April 26, 2017, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; revealed that Nicks would be featured on a track from American singer Lana Del Rey&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Lust for Life&quot;, which was released on July 21, 2017. The song is titled &quot;Beautiful People Beautiful Problems&quot;.

On July 9, 2017, Nicks performed at the British Summer Time festival in Hyde Park in London, supporting Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. She later performed &quot;Stop Draggin&#x27; My Heart Around&quot; with Petty as part of the Heartbreakers&#x27; set, in what would turn out to be their final performance of the song together before Tom Petty&#x27;s death in October 2017.

In April 2018, Lindsey Buckingham was fired from Fleetwood Mac, following disagreements with Nicks and Mick Fleetwood. Nicks helped recruit his replacements, Mike Campbell of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and Neil Finn of Crowded House. This reworked lineup embarked on a world tour entitled An Evening with Fleetwood Mac in 2018–2019.

In April 2019, Nicks was elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. She became the first woman to be inducted twice, once as a member of Fleetwood Mac and once as a solo artist.

In September 2020, Nicks released a live album and concert film, with recordings from the 24 Karat Gold Tour (2016–2017), directed by Joe Thomas. On October 9, 2020, Nicks released her first new music in six years. The official video accompanying the track &quot;Show Them the Way&quot; was directed by Cameron Crowe.

In December 2020, music publishing company Primary Wave bought an 80% stake of Nicks&#x27; song catalog. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; valued the deal at US$100 million.

On May 27, 2021, Stevie Nicks was one of the headliners of the 2021 Shaky Knees Music Festival in Atlanta, Georgia. In August 2021 Nicks canceled her five planned 2021 solo appearances due to concern about catching COVID-19.

Nicks appeared on the track &quot;Oil&quot; on the 2023 Gorillaz album &quot;Cracker Island&quot;.

Nicks sang &quot;What Has Rock and Roll Ever Done for You&quot; with Dolly Parton on her Rockstar album in 2023. 

On September 27, 2024, Nicks released a new song called &quot;The Lighthouse&quot;. Nicks wrote the song with Magnus Birgersson and Vincent Villuis to promote women&#x27;s rights. Nicks appeared as a featured vocalist on a cover of Ron Sexsmith&#x27;s &quot;Maybe This Christmas&quot; on the charity Christmas album &quot;A Philly Special Christmas Party&quot;, released on November 22, 2024.

== Artistry ==

Standing at , Nicks has stated she felt &quot;a little ridiculous&quot; standing next to Mick Fleetwood, who is . For this reason, she developed a penchant for platform boots. &quot;Even when platforms went completely out of style, I kept wearing them because I didn&#x27;t want to go back to being in heels&quot;, she told &quot;Allure&quot; in 1995. Over the years, Nicks has developed a style which she calls her &quot;uniform&quot;, consisting of flowing diaphanous clothing, boots and shawls.

Nicks has said that her vocal style and performance antics evolved from female singers like Grace Slick and Janis Joplin. She admitted inspiration when she saw Joplin perform live (and opened for her with her first band Fritz) shortly before Joplin&#x27;s death. Nicks owns a strand of Joplin&#x27;s stage beads. She also commented that she once saw a woman in her audience dressed in dripping chiffon with a Gibson Girl hairstyle and big boots, and Nicks knew she wanted something similar. She took the look and made it her own. Nicks possesses a contralto vocal range and her voice has been described as &quot;gruff&quot; and &quot;feathery&quot;. Over the years, she has decorated her microphone stand with roses, ribbons, chiffon, crystal beads, scarves, and small stuffed toys.

=== Philanthropy ===
Nicks has started a charity foundation titled &quot;Stevie Nicks&#x27;s Band of Soldiers&quot; which is used for the benefit of wounded military personnel.

In late 2004, Nicks began visiting Army and Navy medical centers in Washington, D.C. While visiting wounded service men and women, she became determined to find an object she could leave with the soldiers that would raise their spirits, motivate, and give them something to look forward to each day. She eventually decided to purchase hundreds of iPod Nanos, load them with music, artists, and playlists which she would hand select, and autograph them:

She now regularly delivers these tokens of her appreciation, bringing her closest friends, such as Mick Fleetwood, along to share the experience:

=== Style ===
Nicks&#x27;s style has remained the same throughout her years in the spotlight and even &quot;at 60 she is still working the gossamer tunics and shawls that have influenced two generations of Stevie acolytes and given her performances the feel of a Wiccan ritual,&quot; writes &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter Ruth La Ferla.

In the late &#x27;70s, Nicks began receiving threatening mail accusing her of witchcraft. Nicks told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 2013, &quot;In the beginning of my career, the whole idea that some wacky, creepy people were writing, &#x27;You&#x27;re a witch, you&#x27;re a witch!&#x27; was so arresting. And there I am like, &#x27;No, I&#x27;m not! I just wear black because it makes me look thinner, you idiots.&#x27;&quot; The witch rumors frightened Nicks so much that she gave up black for a period of time (approximately 1978 to 1982), instead opting to wear colors such as apricot and sea foam green. Nicks later stated that she felt ugly in the new colors, ultimately gave up, and went back to black in 1983. That same year, when asked what she thought about people who still believed the rumor, Nicks said, &quot;I don&#x27;t like it all and I wish people would stop thinking about that, because I spent thousands of dollars on beautiful black clothes and had to stop wearing them for a long time, because a lot of people scared me.&quot;

Nicks sings about the store where her iconic style all started in the song &quot;Gypsy&quot; on Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s 13th studio album &quot;Mirage&quot;, released in 1982. In the song, Nicks sings of a store called the Velvet Underground, a boutique in San Francisco, California, where famous rockers like Janis Joplin and Grace Slick were known to shop.

==Legacy==
Many artists have cited Nicks as a source of influence and musical inspiration. These include Beyoncé and Destiny&#x27;s Child, Courtney Love, Michelle Branch, Belinda Carlisle, The Chicks (formerly known as Dixie Chicks), Mary J. Blige, Sheryl Crow, Nadia Ali, Florence Welch, Taylor Swift, Harry Styles, Vanessa Carlton, Delta Goodrem, and Lorde. Australian singer Darren Hayes cited Nicks as one his favorite musicians during his teenage years, while Eminem&#x27;s mother Debbie Nelson mentioned in her book &quot;My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem&quot; that her son loved the song &quot;Rhiannon&quot;.

The Dixie Chicks covered &quot;Landslide&quot;, which became a top-10 hit (number one on the Adult Contemporary chart) and a number one hit on the Country chart. This cover also earned her a BMI Songwriters Award in 2003 when it won Song of the Year (the award is given to the songwriter of the track, regardless of the performer). According to BMI, &quot;Landslide&quot; also earned Nicks the 35th Robert J. Burton Award as &quot;Most Performed Country Song of the Year&quot;. This distinction is given to the song tallying the most feature U.S. broadcast performances during the eligibility period. Included on the Dixie Chicks&#x27; platinum Monument album &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Landslide&quot; was a Country, Adult Top 40, Hot 100 and AC &quot;Billboard&quot; charts smash. Alternative rock band the Smashing Pumpkins made an acoustic cover of the song that was featured on their 1994 B-side collection &quot;Pisces Iscariot&quot;.

Other successful covers have included the Corrs&#x27; &quot;Dreams&quot; and Courtney Love&#x27;s band Hole with &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot;. &quot;Edge of Seventeen&quot; was sampled on Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s 2001 number one single &quot;Bootylicious&quot;. Nicks appeared in the video for &quot;Bootylicious&quot; and in an episode of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Making the Video&quot; that featured it, in which she expressed her admiration for both the song and the group. Also, American actress and singer Lindsay Lohan covered &quot;Edge of Seventeen&quot; on her second studio album &quot;A Little More Personal (Raw)&quot; (2005). Deep Dish fulfilled their &quot;Dreams&quot; of working with Nicks in 2005 when Nicks offered to re-record vocals on a remix of her number-one penned song, &quot;Dreams&quot;. The Deep Dish version went on to reach number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Airplay chart, as well as providing Nicks with her third UK top-40 hit. Nicks provided additional vocals on Vanessa Carlton&#x27;s 2007 album, &quot;Heroes and Thieves&quot;.

On January 31, 2010, Nicks performed with Taylor Swift at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards. Swift, who describes Nicks as one of her childhood heroes, introduced her to the audience by saying, &quot;It&#x27;s a fairy tale and an honor to share the stage with Stevie Nicks.&quot;

In October 2018, Nicks was one of fifteen artists to be nominated for induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. On December 13, 2018, she was announced as one of seven inductees to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame class of 2019, making her the first woman to be inducted twice to the hall.

On April 19, 2024, singer-songwriter Taylor Swift referenced Nicks in the song &quot;Clara Bow&quot; off of her eleventh studio album &quot;The Tortured Poets Department&quot; (2024). In the song, she wrote &quot;You look like Stevie Nicks / In &#x27;75, the hair and lips&quot;. Nicks also wrote a poem in the liner notes.

== Personal life ==
=== Relationships and family ===
Nicks was romantically linked to Lindsey Buckingham from 1972 to 1976. She was linked to Mick Fleetwood in 1978, Eagles drummer/vocalist Don Henley during the late 1970s, and briefly to Eagles songwriter JD Souther. In 1979, Nicks had an abortion after becoming pregnant by Henley. She was involved with Jimmy Iovine, who produced &quot;Bella Donna,&quot; during 1980–81, and with Eagles and James Gang guitarist Joe Walsh during 1983–1986, to whom she referred in 2007 as one of her greatest loves, but the couple could not sustain the relationship because of mutual drug abuse. Nicks toured with Walsh in 1984 and wrote &quot;Has Anyone Ever Written Anything for You?&quot; about Walsh&#x27;s deceased daughter.

Nicks&#x27;s only marriage was to Kim Anderson, the widower of her best friend Robin Anderson. They married in 1983 soon after Robin Anderson died of leukemia while the &quot;Bella Donna&quot; album was on the top of the charts. Nicks later explained of the marriage, &quot;I was determined to take care of [Robin&#x27;s] baby, so I said to Kim, &#x27;I don&#x27;t know, I guess we should just get married.&#x27;&quot; Nicks and Anderson divorced after only three months: &quot;And so we got married three months after she died, and it was a terrible, terrible mistake. We didn&#x27;t get married because we were in love, we got married because we were grieving and it was the only way that we could feel like we were doing anything.&quot;

Years after the divorce, she reunited with her stepson when he was a teenager, putting him through college, and has maintained contact with him ever since. In 2020, Nicks said in an interview for &quot;The Guardian&quot; that his daughter, named Robin after his late mother, calls Nicks &quot;Grandma Stevie&quot;.

Nicks has said that she consciously chose not to have children of her own, due to her demanding career and desire to follow her art wherever it should take her: &quot;My mission maybe wasn&#x27;t to be a mom and a wife; maybe my particular mission was to write songs to make moms and wives feel better.&quot;

Of her niece, godchildren, former stepson, and extended family she says: &quot;I have lots of kids. It&#x27;s much more fun to be the crazy auntie than it is to be the mom, anyway.&quot;

Nicks has maintained a journal nearly every day since her tenure in Fleetwood Mac began. She has said, &quot;I like to tell all my fairy goddaughters and my niece that when I&#x27;m gone they can sit on the floor and go through all these journals, and they can walk through my life, and they can smell the gardenia perfume on the pages. They can have it in their hands, who I was.&quot;

Regarding a book based on her life, she has said, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t write a book unless I could really tell the truth, and say all the people are in it are represented right... If I&#x27;m gonna talk about all the people in my life, I need to be old enough and so do they, that nobody&#x27;s gonna care ... I would never write a book about the bad parts. I would mostly revel in the fantastic parts, of which there were so many.&quot;

=== Residences ===
Until July 2007, Nicks lived in Paradise Valley, Arizona, a suburb of Phoenix, in a home she had built in 1981 and shared with her brother, Christopher Nicks, his wife, Lori Perry-Nicks, and their daughter, Jessica, her niece. She announced in mid-2007 that her Paradise Valley home would be put up for sale, citing her aspirations to &quot;downsize&quot; and focus more on her charity work, and that in the previous year she had only &quot;spent about two weeks there&quot;. The house was put on the market for a reported $3.8 million and later sold for $3 million. She owns an oceanside home in Santa Monica, California.

=== Religion ===
Nicks became an ordained minister with the Universal Life Church and officiated at the wedding of Deer Tick singer John McCauley and singer-songwriter Vanessa Carlton on December 27, 2013.

In October 2005, Nicks attended the Melbourne Cup Week in Australia, and one of the horse-racing stakes was named after her: The Stevie Nicks Plate. She used this opportunity to launch her promotion of an Australian/New Zealand extension to her &quot;Gold Dust&quot; tour in February and March 2006. Nicks toured in Australia and New Zealand with popular Australian performer John Farnham. She also appeared in concert with Tom Petty in June near Manassas, Virginia, and at the Bonnaroo Music Festival that same month.

In 2006, Nicks performed with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers for the first leg of their tour in the summer, and later in the year returned as a guest performer for a number of songs on the tour celebrating Petty&#x27;s 30th anniversary since his debut album. Tom Petty&#x27;s Homecoming Concert in Gainesville, FL, which contained performances with Stevie Nicks, was filmed for PBS &quot;Soundstage&quot; as well as DVD release for March 2007. Nicks was also the featured performer for Bette Midler&#x27;s benefit function, Hulaween, in October 2006.

In 2008, Nicks embarked on the &quot;Soundstage Sessions&quot; tour in the U.S. A video recording of one concert date was released in 2009: &quot;Live in Chicago&quot;. Vanessa Carlton performed as a guest artist.

Rod Stewart and Nicks co-headlined the Heart &amp; Soul Tour. Launched March 20, 2011, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the tour united the two singers for a series of arena concerts throughout North America – with performances in New York, Toronto, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit, Tampa, Montreal, and more.

A solo tour for &quot;In Your Dreams&quot; began on August 9, 2011, in Denver, Colorado. Nicks announced on her July 27 appearance on &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; that Michael Grimm would be going on tour with her. She then continued on an Australian and New Zealand leg of the tour accompanied by Dave Stewart until December 2011.

Nicks joined Rod Stewart in the summer of 2012 for another leg of the Heart &amp; Soul Tour, and resumed the &quot;In Your Dreams&quot; tour in June 2012. In 2023, she and Billy Joel performed a series of concerts across the United States, beginning with SoFi Stadium outside Los Angeles on March 10. This was in conjunction with a solo tour. In early 2024, she announced a European leg to the tour, starting in Dublin, Ireland on July 3.
